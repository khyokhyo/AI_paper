Highly recommended - best day thing we did in Amsterdam."

Our tour guide (Girl) Mike was ah-mazing! She was fun, concerned for our well-being, fun factor and safety as well knowledgeable about the city, the country - it was fascinating. I would say this is a MUST for a visit to get out of the city for a few hours. Affordable and great fun."

Having visited Amsterdam many times before and cycled there every time (and borrowed friends bikes in the past) - I wanted to avoid being obviously seen as a tourist. They were very helpful inside and explained everything we needed to know. We were given a bike each, including bike lights, 2 locks for each bike, storage bags that went on the back and a pouch for the front. We opted to rent with insurance just in case anything happened and were pleasantly surprised that this only cost us 23 euros for 3 days. The bikes were great and I would hugely recommend using Mike's for bike rentals in the city."

Matthias was engaging, intelligent and gave us a fantastic overview of the city's history and culture. This has to be a great way to see a city. We have done cycle trips in many different cities worldwide and this was a great tour. Thank you Matthias for being and excellent guide and also for your recommendations of other things to do. This tour is a must!"

We had a good tour with Matthias (knowledgeable, fun, friendly and helpful), we found this just right for getting your bearings and it was fun just cycling around the canals and taking in the views. I and my daughter thought it was a good trip and found it interesting, could have done with a little time to take photos (but absolutely recognize this is not possible when doing a group tour) but took a few when possible and then took bikes out the day after to stop at our leisure and took our photos then. Would recommend it. Never once felt unsafe, kept to the group and the guide made sure all of use at dangerous points were all together and crossing together on the larger tram roads. Thanks!"

This was probably the worst tour of my entire trip. My tour guide was one of the older guys in staff, I think his name started with an S, and I was under the impression that he was tired of giving the same tours and really didn't care about the customer experience. Didn't have that good of a time and would not recommend. Better luck with another guide."

However, the tour guide was unprofessional and made several remarks that made me uncomfortable. Throughout the tour he said:\"Such a nice thing, four women trying to obey me.\" (In the context of giving biking instructions to me and 3 other women.)\"So I'm sitting in a tree, with all these attractive gay men around me. I wish I was gay - but I like girls. So they dragged me out of the tree and into the bushes and, well, you can imagine the rest.\" (I found it odd to be asked to imagine sexual assault while biking through the city.)He made a few other remarks, but this should give you a general idea. Three people left the tour early. I should have left, as well. He took this very personally - and then loudly and repeatedly used profanity to describe the people who left. TripAdvisor's guidelines will not allow me to publish what he said. Go to a different company. I've gone on many tours around the world and this has never happened before.All of that being said, he was knowledgeable about the city and did take us to many interesting places. The bikes provided by the company were high-quality. Unfortunately, his remarks somewhat overshadowed his touring skills."

We had Sam as our fearless leader, who expertly wove us in and out of the masses of moving bicycles and traffic without a hitch. The four to five hour tour leads you through interesting parts of the city, but my favorite by far was the country areas. Sam had a good grasp of the history and everyday goings on in the city and a great sense of humor we all enjoyed. Going through the country, we saw many animals, beautiful homes, farmland and canals. We stopped at a working dairy farm. There, they not only made delicious cheese, but surprisingly, they also made wooden shoes. We were able to watch the process of both and buy some in the gift shop they had on site. Amsterdam is full of interesting architecture, friendly people, unique boutiques and sites you won't ever see anywhere else. This bike trip will make your visit perfect! (Thanks, Sam. It was truly a pleasure to meet you.)"

Thank you so much to Matthias our guide who gave us such an interesting tour with a great insight to Amsterdam's history and culture answering all questions so well, as well as making us all laugh and have a lot of fun! Thank you also Matthias for showing us the rijsttafel restaurant with incredible food which we really enjoyed, and for recommending to us the verzetsmuseum which is a great alternative if you haven't booked tickets for Anne Frank's house. A thoroughly enjoyable tour and perfect to get our bearings of the city. We would definitely recommend to all and will be sure to do another one when we return!Ella, Hugh, Ken and Christine Comrie."

Grabbed some items for a picnic at a nearby grocery before the tour beforehand. There were 11 in our group, ranging from late twenties to late sixties. Our guide, Girl Mike, did a great job maintaining a manageable pace for everyone and was very entertaining. It's about a 27km ride beside the Amstel River, with frequent stops, including several windmills and a farm where gouda cheese and wooden clogs are made. It was at this stop that we ate our picnic lunch. The farmer who runs the place was a hoot.The terrain is very flat, with the only hills being going over the bridges. Easy, beautiful ride with a very organized, professional company. Highly recommend!Note - we visited in the off season, but they had groups arriving/leaving nonstop. Several in our group had walked in that day and requested a tour, and they accommodated us. If you're going in the summer, it might be a good idea to buy tickets in advance."

We were the oldest at 65 & 69, but it was easy and everyone was able to keep up. We stopped at a windmill, a cheese \"factory\"/wooden shoe maker, a beautiful park and plenty of the city. We actually rented bikes the following day to tour on our own. I suggest this to everyone...it was great!"

I had only 1 Sunday because I was on a business trip. Anyway, Google related me to this City bike tour which had quite a lot of positive comment, so I gave it a go together with my another friend. We bought coupons online and it was quite easy.SInce it was our first time to Amsterdam, it took us a while to find the meeting point with the help of Google map.Staff there were friendly and helpful, and the tour lead humorously introduced us some basic safety advice. Then we split into smaller group of 14. I think they are very experienced and well organized.Our lead took us to quite many places, usually 10 minutes ride apart, and at every stop he would explained to us the history of the spot, and we took many photos along the way. The bike was quite easy to ride, as the seat is big meaning it is very butt friendly, and basically Amsterdam is quite flat, and thus those gears are good enough for small slope up in many situation.There happened to have a Marathon going on, and thus we didn't go to the Museum square, yet all the other spots we visited were beautiful, especially under a great sunny and windy weather.Everyone in the small group enjoyed the 3 hours tour, just a little bit of sweat, yet can see many area of the Amsterdam area. Special thanks to our handsome young tour guide, and I will highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Amsterdam for their first time.If I am making a come back, I just need to rent a bike there. ;)"

Matthias was a great guide, putting everyone at ease and helping us navigate the bike lanes of Amsterdam before the city quickly gave way to fields and canals. Despite a rainy day the kids had a great time and the stop-off at the cheese farm and clogs workshop definitely gave them a taste of a very different way of life. The bikes were good quality and well maintained and we enjoyed the good humoured friendly atmosphere of everyone in the shop. Highly recommended."

Today we had a group of 9 bikes. Our guide, Mike, ( a woman named , Mike) called us a family and suggested we stay together. We were all given biking protocol for the streets of Amsterdam along with rain ponchos. Both were helpful as there are throngs of bikers and unpredictable weather. Mike was informative on the history and the culture of the city. She was kind, personable and hilarious. Cannot remember ever enjoying a bike tour more. We had some bike troubles, flat tires etc, which were promptly resolved by a cell phone call to the main store which sent an employee with a ' new' bike. We celebrated the end of our tour with beverages of local beer and coffee and lively conversation. Loved it. Loved it. And Mike, made the tour so fabulous. Way to go, Mike !!"

We were able to do a lot of the city by walking and canal, so we chose the Countryside Tour for bikes. Biking in the city was kinda nerve racking, but girl Mike really explained things well before and during the tour. She really prepped us on what to expect on the city streets before hitting the country side. Girl Mike was really fun, loved all her Dutch comments and I'm sure we could have swayed her into taking us for a pit stop at a pub if we tried. The cheese was delicious and bought some for home. Seeing the clogs was okay, not sure intriguing - mostly cause the farmer is an odd dude. But overall, a good experience. Also, I appreciated that had some backup panchos for us that morning in case it rained. My only 'complaint' is that instead of taking a packed lunch, it would have been nice to stop somewhere to eat... even if it was only for 30 min. While traveling, it's not super convenient to have to find something to pack for lunch. But we managed to grab some croissant sandwiches from some cafe before we got to the bike shop so it was fine, but lunch at a cafe/pub during the tour would have been better."

We had a great time and having a local as a tour guide certainly adds to the cultural experience. I did this bike ride 17 years ago and its hardly changed...its requires low levels of fitness, just watch out for cars and other locals on bikes. You are soon in the countryside enjoying windmills, green fields and eventually a cheese farm. We also had a cheeky beer on the way home!

Also went for a drink at the end of our trip and shared more stories. Reasonable prices, quality bikes, good value! Remember it is Amsterdam so if you want a G rated trip, you should ask in advance and take a private trip...we were a group of adults and asked for the full version of the stories ie red light district but if you want a family version, you should ask in advance. Great fun, would definitely do it again and recommend to friends!"

The ride into the country is beautiful. The cheese farm is a little cheesy (lol), but it is excellent quality and delicious! Anyone who rates this tour badly has absolutely no sense of humor. I've also seen some comments about how the level of physical activity is hard, but that is not the case (unless you can't walk to the parking lot). Mike's bike shop is efficiently run, professional, and friendly. Highly recommend!!"

The guys took us outside Amsterdam, about 40 mins cycle and then visited a cheese farm, cycled through the forest, stopped at the a former Olympic location and windmill and the best was where we crossed the water and stepped on this mushy, soft grass where one group jumped up and felt the vibration underneath ones feet. The guys are great, up for a laugh. Really enjoyed it!!"

It was a fun way to get to see the city and participate in the local tradition of riding bikes as the primary mode of transportation. Our guide was actually Canadian, which was a bit odd, but he seemed to know his stuff. I learned a lot about the city and some of its history. As you can imagine, 11 people trying to follow a guide through the city during rush hour was a bit challenging. If you want to do this tour and you are a less than confident bike rider, I would suggest skipping this tour. I watched a few in our group struggle, get in the way of locals, etc. so I would recommend the tour and Mike's bikes for those that want the experience and are comfortable riding bikes through a bit of chaos...I really enjoyed it."

Our tour guide Daniel was a native of Amsterdam with a funny, dry sense of humor. There are a million bikes whizzing around Amsterdam so it was great to have a tour guide to help navigate the busy city. We chose the \"country tour\" which brought yus outside the city where we saw an old windmill and learned about all of the drainage that keeps Amsterdam - once a swamp - from suffering flood damage. We also stopped at a cheese and wooden shoe factory. A farmer gave us a tour and he was a big character. He is one of only 3 producers of wooden shoes and he showed us how the machines work. We loved the tour and would recommend it to anyone in the city."

We got to see a working windmill, bike through the swamp lands, go to a clog/cheese farm with a very interesting, eccentric farmer. Another cool (and maybe scary) thing was being able to bike through the busy streets of Amsterdam.One thing I would suggest is perhaps asking if a biker on the tour is new or inexperienced with biking (maybe during the booking process because they did ask at the beginning of the tour in front of a big crowd and no one spoke up) and having an additional guide on hand to assist them on the tour. Biking through Amsterdam is quite a challenge for even someone who knows how to bike, but for a beginner it can be absolutely terrifying. So having that extra support on hand would help and improve the experience for all the bikers on the tour (both intermediate and beginner)."

The farmer is eccentric to say the least and definitely has some opinions about Asian clog imports! The cheese is amazing though. As expected, you exit through the gift shop but there's no pressure to buy anything. It's a good spot for lunch so pack some food and drink. There are saddle bags on most bikes for your stuff.

The folks at Mikes do a good job with bike safety briefing.

Location is good, maybe a 15 minute walk from the Central Station and on a main road so easy to find. All the staff were brilliant - very friendly, funny and helpful - and spoke perfect English. The tour began with a safely briefing and demonstration of how the bikes worked - this may sound daft but in a strange city it's important to have the bike set up to suit you and to know which brake lever operates which brake, how the gears work, etc. There were 30 of us on this tour so we split into 3 groups of 10, each with its own tour guide; we had Mike and she was briliant - very funny but also informative too. One tourist was delegated to stay at the back to make sure we all got through lights, etc and we were told of the procedure to follow if anyone got lost.The tour itself took us along city streets, some quiet and some fairly busy, so I'd advise anyone booking to have a degree of confidence on a bike. We stopped a couple of times and grouped together to hear Mike tell us about the area or how Amsterdam was built and developed before carrying on into the countryside to cycle along the banks of the Amstel. Weather was great, pace not too fast but we did make progress and once out of the city everything felt a lot more relaxing.The tour included a couple of stops, one at a windmill and one at a Gouda and clog farm. The windmill stop was literally that, a stop to look at a windmill without going in (it's a private residence) but the Gouda / clog stop was much more interesting as we saw cheese being made (and sampled some different types) and saw clogs being made too. The farm is a very laid back, family run type business so we stayed here for a while to eat lunch (bring your own), refill water bottles and shop for souvenirs. Mikes Bikes no doubt get a kickback from the farm for bringing tourists in (this was joked about) and the farm needs tourist money I guess to help it survive but don't feel used or under pressure to buy anything. However I'm glad we bought some clogs and trinkets - the clogs in particular were the best I saw in the city and reasonably priced and I'd have been a bit miffed with myself if we hadn't bought them there and then; yes it's a bit of a pain carrying them back in your backpack but go prepared, it's worth it.Overall this was a great day. Booked for 4 hours and ended up taking over 5 but would have done more if we could have. The group was great, Mike the guide is brilliant and this was definitely a highlight of our holiday. Thoroughly recommended."

The most challenging part for me, someone who doesn't traditionally ride a bike ever, was being aware of all of the locals speeding past who are very familiar with this mode of transportation.I enjoyed this way more than my canal tour, as it was way more personalized, engaging and interactive than sitting on a boat and listening to an audio recording. Also...inexpensive! =)"

It seems wrong not to bike here, but for those of us not used to urban biking, this was a much safer way to do it. As a bonus you got a great scenic tour, a great guide and a visit to a cheese farm (even if the farmer was a bit odd). A must do while in Amsterdam."

His name was Jeff and he had so much knowledge about the city as well as good restaurant suggestions afterwards. He was really funny and overall made me feel very comfortable and safe on the tour, considering how intimidating a bike tour can be in Amsterdam. As I've travelled through Europe and done more bike tours now, I still compare them to my first one as it was of such good standard! The bikes were really comfortable too and smooth to ride. They weren't as awkward as a few others I've ridden. I would really suggest to go with this company and I will definitely be back to do it again!"

Two minutes on a bike tour is not usually an issue as most of the time people are getting their bikes in order and the tours don't leave until 15 to 20 minutes late. However my sister and I ended up at the wrong location as well. When we walked in at two minutes past 11 and spoke with the man at the desk he explained that the tour had supposedly already left from the other location (with out even making a phone call to check) and that our options were to take a city tour (which we had already done) or get a 50% refund. Now I understand that we were late and at the rental shop not where the tour departs from but I had pre booked a reservation online and already pre paid. I also never received a confirmation email from the company. We must have spent about 5 minutes going back and forth with the gentleman at the desk saying how we got lost trying to find the location and never got an email and he kept telling us well its not my fault you're late and that you're at the wrong location it is all explained on our website. Well Im sorry but two minutes late when you know we are coming and not letting us join the tour at a different location (such as the first stop which was right down the street from the rental shop) seems a little crazy to me. Then as if we didn't understand what the man at the desk was saying a women who works in the shop walks over and starts saying the exat same things. Basically my sister and I wanted a full refund for the tour that we couldn't join and the two bike shop employees were very confrontational saying how nothing was their fault. Obviously that is true none of the occurrences were specifically their fault but would expect a bit more calm, friendly, and accommodating service from the number one company on trip advisor. When all is said and done the tension did break and the man offered to give us a daily bike rental and refund the rest of out tour price. He also very nicely showed us the bike tour route for us to follow and gave us some great suggestions for lunch and where to go/see. Honestly everything did turn out for the better my sister and I enjoyed riding around the countryside on our own and not having to follow a tour schedule. We also were able to meet up with the tour that we were supposed to be on at the cheese farm/clog factory and the tour guide put us right in with her group. Basically I am sure this is a great great company but we had a bad experience with the two people at the rental shop being so confrontational at first."

Follow the guide through smaller streets, stop for an explanation of different areas. Though the guide was pleasant, I generally prefer more in depth information. After all, they are \"guides\". How else are visitors supposed to learn? My suggestion...when you do the \"snack, drink\" pause, take the opportunity to get her everyone around and provide better history. People riding all strung out can't hear you beyond the second person in line."

And you should definitely not take the city tour if you are new to bike riding (as our guide told us, this is not a city where you want to learn how to ride a bike). But if you're reasonably comfortable on a bike, and pay attention to your surroundings (mainly other bikes and the occasional car), there is not better way to get around the city and experience its neighborhoods. We had an excellent guide -- Mattias -- who provided just the right mix of history and contemporary observations.Our bikes were in excellent condition, and even had saddle bags for our water and other belongings. We were blessed with excellent weather, which certainly enhanced the experience, but I imagine a little rain wouldn't be a bother."

The tour took us through the countryside and we got to discover a side of Amsterdam away from the touristy areas. We got a highly tailored experience with our party of 4. Our guide Pete was super knowledgeable and took us to a farm, a windmill brewery, and showed us a variety of cool things in the countryside. I would highly recommend doing a tour with this company, even more so if you can spend a little extra to get the custom private experience. It really is worth it, as we saw another big tour group behind us going a bit slower, probably having to miss some of the sites. The countryside tour is neat if you want to see a different side of Amsterdam that isn't really advertised. 30 minutes out of the city you'll see some of the most beautiful fields, and learn about farmers and the flow of water into the city. Thank you Pete and Mike's bikes."

She was qwerky, witty & had excellent knowledge of the City, being a local and all. She took us to all her favourite spots & not through Vondelpark like other tours, due to the time restraints. Along the way she gave informative talks about all the landmarks in the region & a brief history of them too. Amsterdam can be quite an intimidating place to cycle, but she made it extremely comfortable for us. At the end of the tour we were taken to a nice little pub where we could get a drink from, after the not-so-tiring bike tour. We hired bikes ourselves from Mike's Bikes (with discount) the next day to do some more exploring. Definitely recommend!"

My two teenagers and I rode through the countryside with Girl Mike and thoroughly enjoyed the ride, the scenery and the commentary provided by our guide. The first part of the ride goes through part of the city. I never felt unsafe, but I certainly was glad that my children were paying attention to what was going on - the cars, the other bikes, the moped riders. There was a lot to process while keeping up with the group. We got out of the city and on a lovely path through the polders to see windmills, wildlife, and beautiful houses. Mike's Bikes suggests that you bring a lunch and water. Heed this advice! When you arrive at the cheesemaker/clog maker's house, you will definitely be in need of something to eat. We didn't buy anything at the souvenir stop, but it was interesting to hear about making the cheese and the clogs. The quirky gentleman who gives the tour is apparently one of only three clogmakers still left in the Netherlands.Girl Mike was fantastic. She loves Amsterdam and has funny story to impart to the group along the way. There was a bit of history as well, but not too much. She was quite careful to make sure no one was being left behind. That having been said, you do need to be ready to ride against the wind and be very comfortable on a bike to do this trip. It was a great way to spend time in Amsterdam - highly recommend."

Not only do they have an incredible knowledge of The Netherlands as a whole, they are also full of practical knowledge about how not to get hurt on a bicycle in Amsterdam. It's not a strenuous cycle at all, but it is long, so don't try lining something up to close afterwards. You'll see so much of the city, as well as a windmill on the way out to the highlight of the trip; the cheese farm. The farmer is eccentric and hilarious, and the cheese is devine. He'll show you how he makes the cheese, how he makes the Dutch clogs, and you'll also see the cows who begin the whole process. There is also a wonderful gift shop with cheese and plenty of lovely trinkets and collectibles for friends and family. You'll then cycle on to the forest, and also into Vondelpark. On your way back to the bike shop you'll take a different route into the city and pass the Reijksmuseum, and the I AMSTERDAM sign.This tour was absolutely without a doubt the highlight of my trip, it was so informative and there is so much to see on it. It's unbelievably good value.

I took my three kids (ages 10, 15, 17), and while we are all competent bikers, we do not usually bike this far but we found the tour very manageable. The countryside was absolutely beautiful and we enjoyed the tour of the cheese farm.The only reason I'm giving this tour a 4 instead of a 5 is because of our tour guide. There were several guides, and our group got stuck with the nasty Australian whose name I don't recall. There were other tour guides who seemed much nicer. Within 5 minutes of leaving the bike store, our guide was scolding a woman in our group for not keeping up. Instead of asking if her bike was ok, he remarked, \"Do you not see the gap between you and the bike in front of you?\" and then \"Do you not drive?\" My 10 year old was the only child in the group. She had no problems keeping up, but the city biking intimidated her. At the beginning, our guide suggested that she stay up close with him, which I thought was a good idea, but after the first five minutes of the tour he ignored her and she was unable to push to the front of the line. She easily kept up with the group, but there were times at the beginning and end of the tour (when we were leaving and then re-entering the city) when she was confused about whether to follow the group or follow the traffic signal during road crossings. She knew that our guide would be angry if we missed the light, but some crossings required a single file and there was no way we would all make it within one light cycle. This created an unsafe situation. On the way back into the city, our guide barely looked back or even paused at lights to see if we had all made it through. Of course he was charming enough when requesting a tip at the end of the ride.I would still recommend this tour and we were able to ignore our guide and have a wonderful time."

We got given our bikes (easy and comfortable to ride) and headed off without any fuss or hassle. Our guide (Daniel) was hilarious. Great, informative knowledge of the city and sights and very patient with all cyclists- but with a charm and sense of humour that added to the relaxed atmosphere of the trip. It was one of our favourite bits of our 4 day stay in Amsterdam and would highly recommend. The farm is fun and a nice lunch spot and its a lovely day to see a bit more of beautiful Amsterdam. The trip lasted the full 4 hours (maybe a bit longer)- was great fun and not too strenuous at all. Really really super."

My partner and I went on a countryside tour which took us through the city and out to the countryside and we visited one of the three remaining windmills left in Amsterdam which is absolutely beautiful :) we then went to a little farm where we were run through the family's cheese making business and their clog making business which was really interesting and enjoyable! This is a fantastic day out our tour guide Sam \"Amstersam\" is fantastic, he was funny and really knowledgeable! Learnt quite a lot on the tour and we both just really enjoyed the atmosphere created by the tour! Thanks heaps if we are back in Amsterdam we will try one of your other tours. I would definitely recommend this for anyone wanting to see a different side of Amsterdam!"

Cycling is really the best way to get around the city - we really never used our tram passes. As for the tour, we took the one through the Countryside, which I would recommend.

The bikes were it top condition too, all with their own individual traits; my girlfriend had Winnie the Pooh, complete with bell!This tour is ideal on your first trip to Amsterdam, your first day if possible, as you see all the sights and get a real understanding of the city and it's layout.

We biked through the city streets into the countryside to see a windmill and a farm where they make cheese and wooden clogs. It was very interesting and the cheese was delicious! Then we biked through a beautiful park, had a nice lunch, and returned to the city. This bike tour was a highlight of our trip!! We felt like the locals, many of whom bike for transport. You need to be a decent bike rider and be able to bike many miles to participate in the tour.

The only issue with our tour was the size, there were 15 people in our group, including a family of 8. The family was not able to keep up with the group and we had to frequently stop, which was annoying. It was the adults, not the kids, which needed frequent breaks. However, our tour guide was great and tried his best to accommodate everyone. Mike's Bikes was great and easy to use, just wish the group had been smaller to get through the streets of Amsterdam a little easier. I would recommend this tour! Great way to experience Amsterdam. You do not have to be a really experienced biker to do this, just able to actually ride a bike and be able to go 18 miles over 4 hours. You stop throughout the tour, but you should be able to bike at a decent pace for 30 to 45 minutes in between stops."

We had a regular Amsterdam weather (scattered showers and cloudy); however, the guide made sure we all enjoy the trip all the way. The tour goes around different sights at the countryside, then though the city (the itinerary may change) and is perfect to be your first trip when you arrived to this magical city.I will recommend this tour for families (with kids over 13 years old) and any other person willing to pedal for over 20 km.Good fun and workout at the same time!."

Our family was back in Amsterdam for the day on July 5 and this time we booked the countryside tour with Mike's Bike Tours and once again we were NOT dissapointed! What a wonderful day we had!! Our tour guide was \"Mikey\" blond hair, dutch accent, and she was absolutely awesome. ( i hope i got your name right! ) She gave a wonderful informative, educational and entertaining bike tour throughout the countryside! Wow.. she was funny and led us safely around the roads, canals and bridges. We had some rainfall but it stopped quickly just as it had started. They provide rain ponchos, which kept us dry each time it came down. It was totally fine.According to my fitbit, we biked 18 miles and were out 4 3/4 hours. Best day ever again in Amsterdam! Worth every dollar, best way to see the countryside/outskirts of Amsterdam! Thank you Mikey for a wonderful day! (the family from Pennsyl U.S. & the tall guy that rode in the back... :)"

Our tour guides had a good attitude and were effective at shepherding whole groups of people through the unfamiliar Amsterdam bike system- as long as you know how to ride a bike, you'll be fine, they'll take care of you.Unless you're time-constrained, take the \"country\" tour and skip the \"city\" tour. In our city tour, guide Matthias knew the tour and was charming and funny, but the tour itself didn't give us a sense of direction- orientation to the city or much of a sense of where to visit next (though it was not a bad tour by any means, and if it's the one you can do, do it!). The country tour actually also spent a fair amount of time in the city and covered most of the important historical and landmark elements as the city tour (though our guide Mike lent her own distinctive air top the presentation)... plus you get to see a lot of distinctively Dutch stuff other than the architecture. A slight negative note on the management. While our guides were great, we had an initial bad time setting things up; we tried to book online, and first it said it failed, but then sent us a reservation (but didn't charge for it). Apparently they were full and this was a website glitch, we were told when we arrived; but not five minutes after we were booked into a later tour, we saw them tell someone else that additional positions might open up due to cancellations (and they did). Furthermore, we also booked our second tour on the spot but didn't get the multi-tour discount, nor were we even told about it until the end of the first tour (though to be fair, they did refund the discount after we pointed this out); and when we paid, we weren't given a receipt or ticket or any other indication we'd paid, other than being told we were \"in the system\". Which we were, in the end, no further snafu, but all of these interactions felt weird and a little off-putting.But back to the tours. Take the countryside tour if you can, and the city tour if you can't, and cycle your way round this incredibly unusual city."

Also beware of the online booking, I booked online and got a reservation number but didn't get charged, then when I emailed I was told the tour was now full. A little HR help might be in order in Amsterdam). Anyway, Mattias (sp?) was my guide and he was really fun. He was attentive making sure no one got left behind and made sure everyone was engaged in the experience. That being said, the city tour really just hits a bunch of the touristy areas that you could really see on any tour. If you only have two-ish hours though, still worth it. Two days later I did the Countryside tour. TOTALLY worth it. If you have the 4+ hours Take this tour. You see more of the city and get to see a windmill and a cheese farm. The areas of the city we went through really show more dimensions of the whole city and is a wicked cool trip. \"Girl Mike\" (Mika) was our guide and she had lots of fun things to say on the trip. Overall a really good time. I would have given 5/5 for both tours if not for my initial booking issue."

Meeting location was a short walk from our hotel and directions were very easy to follow. Once we arrived to the place we were greeted by one of the tour guides although the atmosphere was a little informal - not clear who was responsible for what. It took them few minutes to get organized but after that, things flowed more smoothly (not sure if it was related to the size of the group). They ended up splitting the group in two (about 12-13 bikers each which was appropriate). They provided rain coats (\"ponchos\") just in case but no helmet (I really like that as I don't like using a helmet while biking but if you will like one, not sure they will offer it). Biking was easy (is almost 100% flat) and they will take you to areas in the city that you may not find on your own. The guide offered some history, which although good, not at the level of other tours that I have taken. All in all, tour is good but not the best that I have taken in Amsterdam."

The whole team was friendly and funny and unpretentious. Aaron - the team leader of the trip made everyone feel comfortable and ready to ride. Our guide was Diego and i enjoyed his short little bits of info that he gave throughout our trip. Occasionally we would stop and he would explain something we were seeing or what our upcoming section of road would be like. We stopped at a windmill and a cheese factory and also a clog factory adjacent to the cheese factory. The clog maker is odd - let me warn you...just odd. And slightly creepy. But - the cheese next door is awesome. Diego gave us some guidelines on riding in the city which is helpful. The weather was gray and threatening rain the whole time so they handed out ponchos just in case. I think we ended up on the tour for about four hours which was perfect and we clearly got our money's worth."

It was a great way to experience cycling through the bustling streets of the city whilst remaining safe. Our tour guide was very informative and told us about many of the major attractions in Amsterdam. The bikes are in good condition and the tour goes at a steady pace so people of all fitness levels are able to enjoy it. Also would love to do the country tour as well some day as we enjoyed it so much! Very much worth it if you are planning on cycling around the city!"

            "review": "Good at first, quickly turned terrible. My girlfriend and I did Mike's Bike Tour, and I enjoyed it. The tour was fast paced, so you need to be good on a bike while there is a lot of traffic around (people, cars, other bikes). Our tour guide was great and knowledgeable, she answered all of our questions very well. However, if you are not an experienced biker, this tour may be difficult for you since the tour guide kind of had a \"tough love\" approach when it came to making sure everyone was comfortable while riding. Okay, that is the good part.After the tour, we both rented 2 bikes. These were absolutely terrible, and very dangerous too. My girlfriend doesn't ride bikes much, so the whole time we rode, I was trying to explain to her how to switch gears and that it is so much easier once you can do this. After much frustration that she was having with her bike, I finally tried it for myself. When changing the gears, nothing happened. It felt as if it was on the highest gear in all of the gears, changing them did nothing. No wonder she was having such a hard time. This was just HER bike, mine was much worse.We were on the way back to the shop to return the bikes, about 2 miles out. I was in the middle of a busy intersection filled with cars and other bikers when, suddenly, the pedal completely flies off of the bike, This interfered with another bikers path and made them, as well as me and 2 others, fly off of our bikes. Luckily no one was hurt somehow, but that did not stop all of these locals from brutally cussing me out in Dutch, which I absolutely don't blame them for. After that encounter, I had to ride my girlfriends bike back to the shop to make it in time before they closed, while my girlfriend walked the bike back to the shop for 2 miles and met us there. She was furious, as anyone would be, and I was no exception.I kept my cool in the shop while explaining what had happened, and out of the 4 people that were involved in this conversation, only one asked if I was even okay after hearing that I wrecked in the middle of a busy intersection. They all acted extremely nonchalant, apologized a few times, then gave us HALF of our money back since \"one bike was broken\".My girlfriend and I were literally speechless, we had absolutely no words for this and just wanted to leave immediately after dealing with this incident and the ridiculous way that they handled it. We thought we would get AT LEAST a full refund, not to mention something ON TOP OF THAT. But a 50% refund and a few forced apologies is all we got. Loved the tour, but everything after that was simply awful."

However my friend was in an accident hence was not able to make it. Mike's bike was awesome enough to refund me for that as well as gave me a 5 euro discount refund for using my own bike.The countryside bike tour itself was quite underwhelming. Unfortunately our guide Vincent, was quite impatient hence we spent half of our time either waiting for the rest of the group to catch up or chasing down lost tourists from our group. He was also not very informative.We saw two attractions, a windmill where we just stopped to take pictures and the place of a cheese and wooden shoe maker. The latter was a lot of fun.The experience could have been made better if they are more strict with the quality of their tour guides as well as reducing the size of the tour group so that it would be easier to travel in a smaller group.I would suggest just renting a bike and doing the countryside ride on your own."

We did this tour with our 15 year old daughter and we all loved it, claiming it to be one of our holiday highlights. The city tour took 3 hours including pre-tour talk and stop off for a beer/juice on the return leg. Tour took in Amsterdam's usual and not so usual hotspots with explanations from our guide, but what I really enjoyed was seeing snapshots of everyday life such as group in park doing Tai Chee, little children going to swimming lesson and kids playing footie. It was clearly explained that the bike trip is for confident cyclists and I would echo this. We dealt with city traffic and oblivious pedestrians so you need to have your wits about you. The ride itself was easy with frequent stops suitable for all fitness levels."

The city is so beautiful and by bike is the best way to see it.The OK: I do feel the check in staff at the front desk could be a little less gruff and my husbands back break on his bike was not up to par.

It was just what the doctor ordered! Our guide was Stevan (ASK for Stevan!) and what a fun day it was - with the minor exception of the \"...entertaining Dutch farmer at his cheese farm/clog factory\", but we'll get into that later... The ride was mostly outside the city and the weather was beautiful. There's no difficult terrain and it's great for just about everyone. Now... about that cheese farm/clog factory. The cheese part was fine; didn't learn too much, but it was fine. The farmer, not so entertaining. It was fascinating to learn how they make inexpensive clogs quickly, but he was more of a distraction (a bit annoying) and took away from the overall experience. Certainly not enough to drop this trip anywhere below \"very good\". Especially with Stevan. He made up for anything on the negative side. Overall, I highly recommend this tour and especially if you've seen most of the highlights of Amsterdam already and need a day to get away!"

They're fun, but very professional. I was here three days in a row and got nothing but amazing service.I took the Countryside Tour with Vinny, which was a great way to get comfortable with biking in Amsterdam. They bring you to a Windmill and a cheese farm with the wackiest farmer ever. You get an opportunity to buy cheese, but you're not obligated. This tour brings you through tons of parks, and it's a really nice way to get out of the city. Although the tour is long, it goes at a very leisurely pace, so I'm sure that most people can keep up without getting tired. I also did the Mini tour, which is a short 2-hour tour through the city. The guide was so interesting and funny (shame I forgot his name), and had such great insights. The pace is pretty good, providing you can keep up in the city. There are lots of bridges and streets that you need to cross, so be aware. The bikes are well-maintained. Each bike has a basket in the front where you can put stuff. If you take their tours, they give you 7-gear bikes with handbrakes. Regular rental bikes are pedal-brake bikes, but work just as well. If there was ever a right way to do Amsterdam, it would be through Mike's Bike Tours. It was one of the highlights of my trip."

My only concern was with the hazard that the ponchos played in having the hoods obstruct our vision at crucial moments. They can't be responsible for the rain, however, so it is what it is.

You could see the non-city architecture as well as a working windmill. Got a better feel for the lay of the land. Also, stopped at a working farm where they make Gouda cheese and we were able to meet the cows :). Went inside for a funny and brief tour of how they actually make and store the cheese. Then a short (folksie) presentation on how they make their famous wooden clogs. The guy was funny and engaging and wore all the traditional gear to take you back in time. Then we continued our journey through the canals and parks and back through the city. Felt like a complete tour. Would highly recommend this tour and this company.

We were not disappointed!Our guide was Sam who was a funny and provocative (in a good way!) leader. As some other reviews mention, this is a tour that reflects the laid back approach of Amsterdam to issues like drugs and prostitution. It is not for the uptight or easily shocked.The laid back approach includes the brief instructions at the start of the tour but they were all we needed. The shop had helmets but no one wears them in Amsterdam. The bikes were comfy and easy to ride. I had panniers for my backpack.Some people mention that they found cycling in Amsterdam difficult. As someone who commutes by bike in central London, I can assure you it is not! There are no Lycra clad warriors on racing bikes - everyone makes their way in a relaxed manner on old fashioned \"sit up and beg\" bikes.We were a group of 12 and Sam appointed one of the group to be a \"tail gunner\" to make sure we all stayed together. This worked well and we did not lose anyone. It took a bit of time to get used to the discipline of riding in a group but Sam was really attentive and looked after everyone.The tour was meant to take 3 hours but we were out for about 30 minutes longer. That was because Sam was so engaging and we had some really good discussions with him about Dutch attitudes to drugs and sex - perhaps not something you get with every tour guide but we felt we understood a lot more about the country as a result. It certainly corrected some misconceptions we had.It was a great start to the holiday and really helped us to get our bearings for the rest of the break - both in terms of the city's attitudes and its culture."

Good for the average rider and a great day out especially on a sunny day. Highly recommended!"

He definitely made sure our experience was positive. Although Amsterdam is a \"biking\" city, to master the streets was challenging - our guide told us up front the rules of the road and our biking experience was not a challenge at all but very enjoyable (and a sense of accomplishment). We did the tour of the countryside, windmill, cheese making, ... It was an easy ride and anyone can do it (I'm 61 and in good health). We pretty much did all the typical touristy things in Amsterdam, so this tour was a nice addition for something to do on our last day. So glad we saw a different side of the area."

We had several stops on the 3 hour tour, museum square, Vondelpark, Anne Frank museum, red light district amongst others and culminating in a rather nice beer at the windmill brewery! Don't worry if you dont drink as they have a caf\u00e9 next door selling soft drinks, coffee - and a rather nice apple tart! Sam made this tour for me, extremely knowledgeable and great fun.

Maybe we had conjured up a perception of what the countryside bike tour was going to be like, ie more rural, less touristy. The aspects that let it down for our family was firstly stopping for 15 minutes to take pictures of a windmill which is on a roundabout. Secondly the farm, which is 10 minutes cycle from the windmill and so obviously geared up for tourists. The owner/farmer has got his patter off to a fine art which is great if you have come from distant lands and know nothing of the european culture but not if you are british like us. There was nothing authentic about it and after tasting some slivers of cheese and showing us how clogs are made, we were then taken into the enormous gift shop, encouraging you to buy cheese, clogs and a whole variety of memorabilia. The cycle did improve after this and we ended up cycling back the via the Amstel forest and the vondelpark which was pleasant."

Beyond the cheese factory, we went to a nature reserve filled with different types of birds. Someone had an asthma attack in the middle of the tour so we were delayed a bit. Most of us grabbed a beer while our guide helped the young woman and waited for the ambulance. I was very impressed with how he handled the situation, and all of the guests on the tour were very understanding as well.We did this on our first day in Amsterdam. I would suggest getting to the know the city first then taking the countryside bike tour. If we were to return, we would definitely book their city bike tour."

We were given safety instructions and a quick briefing before heading off. It was slightly daunting for a short while on the bikes as we got used to other cyclists/vehicles on the road, however, our guide made us feel very safe and guided us through traffic lights and busy streets. We visited many sites including Vondelpark, Museumplein, Old/New Church, Red Light District and heard some history about each. Our guide was able to answer any questions that our group asked. My bike handlebars were quite loose, however, Egg had the equipment with him to fix the problem and ensured my safety was paramount. We then stopped towards the end of the tour at Cafe Nel and had some hot drinks to warm us up! The tour was 100% worth the money and we would definitely recommend it to others visiting the city as it is the best way to see Amsterdam and become part of the culture."

Our guide was Sam, who was brilliant, he selected bikes for each of us, gave an introduction ( checking that we could all ride) plus safety instructions, guidance on what do if someone gets into trouble or separated from the group, he then nominated the tallest member to ride at the bike to be the back marker.Our progress was good and we all followed Sam's instructions when it came to traffic lights, turns left and right and keep to the right to avoid trouble with local cyclists etc.We stopped at a number of locations where Sam would provide historical and amusing stories. When we came to the Red Light area we had to walk the bikes through, other stops were at areas of interest ( Hate to say it Sam but according to the Van Gogh Museum he shot himself in the chest!!!)Like other reviewers, we stopped at the Microbrewery in a Windmill, time to sample a couple of their brews. Wound our way back to Mike's after a most enjoyable nearly four hours.A great way to see the City, and in my view the highlight of my few days in Amsterdam."

Try to do a bike your on city breaks as the guides are always knowledgeable about their city and know the back streets do you see more of the real place. We were not disappointed. Arrived to meet the group and collect bikes, given a brief but funny introduction to riding the bike, a few safety rules and we were off.The your lasted around 4 hours, very good value, Laura our guide was good fun, learnt as much about the people and culture as the historic sights. Amsterdam became real. A look back in time as to the reasons the people of the city are so laid back and accepting of others. I learnt a lot and lived cycling about. We went through Vondelpark, the museum area, the red light district, Anne Frank house, up and down the canals, looked at buildings and then towards the end stopped at a bar in a windmill. I recommend this tour as a brilliant way of seeing the city, feeling part of the city and having a giggle. Laura was brilliant and her love for Amsterdam came across - absolutely book it and give it a go if you visit Amsterdam."

This tour really unlocked some history of the city that was a little more off-beat. Instead of the typical historical tour--we got more information about sex, drugs, alcohol, hippies, etc. I really actually enjoyed the mixture of history with the story of the people. We ended up at a windmill bar, and had some food, then headed back. We really liked all of the places we visited and got a good lay of the land in a quick, non-boring way.I would definitely recommend this tour!"

We were really lucky, due to the threat of bad weather there was only one other person on our tour, it was like getting a private tour! We stopped at a traditional Dutch windmill as well as a working dairy farm/wooden clog factory. The people there were really great, a lot of fun, showed us how they make the clogs and make the cheese. Got to try a lot of their delicious cheese, too! And our guide, Sam, was great. Cool dude, led a fun tour. Definitely one of the best things we did during our trip. If you are in relatively good shape, this is a must!"

My friend and I were only in the city for a day and a half and we wanted to ride bikes like the locals and see the city. We did exactly that on this tour. We walked in, paid our fare, and shortly afterward we were matched with a great guide (forgot her name)! It was quite intimidating to ride through the city because there were a lot of other riders and cars out on the roads, but our guide made us feel quite comfortable. I stayed right behind her the entire time! We stopped along the way to take pictures and she gave us a brief history. We even stopped at a bar to have a local drink! Our guide was really interested in catering our tour to what we wanted to see, so we got to see everything we wanted to see! We even rode into more \"suburban\" parts of the city, which was pretty cool. Would definitely recommend this bike tour to anyone visiting Amsterdam."

So glad we did as we had a very enjoyable 3 hours touring around the Canals and over the Amsterdam Alps as Aaron called them (Canal Bridges!).Our host for the trip was 'Californian' Aaron, who was pleasant (Awesome!) and considerate to the group in terms of ensuring we all safe and kept together, even though all on the tour were experienced cycle riders, cycle around Amsterdam is totally different to cycling anywhere else (well at least in the UK anyway), we did have to endure all the seasons in one day, snow, hail, rain and sunshine, but if go prepared then it is no problem, plus the shop will provide 'ponchos' free if the weather is wet.Found Aaron very knowledgeable about the areas he took us too and engaged us in his humorous but educational talks in each district we went to. Really good value for the cost, I am already looking forward to doing the countryside tour they do sometime in the future when ever next I am passing through Amsterdam."

At the end you get to hang out together at a local brewery - and I think all twelve us strangers felt really connected by this personal introduction to the city. This is a must for those visiting this amazing city- not to mention you actually might be able to find your way around the crazy streets when you are done.

Firstly, I would like to put for the record, I am a very positive and accepting reviewer and for me to post something negative requires a high number of things to go wrong, and only those that are human influenced. In other words, I tend to see the positives in most situations. However, Mike\u2019s bike tours has questioned my faith in some of these \u201capparently professional\u201d operations. Mike\u2019s had been highly recommended on Tripadvisor and after a positive experience in Berlin with Fat Bike Tours (review to follow - the company that had been originally set up by \u201cMike\u201d), we were looking forward to spending the short time we had in Amsterdam (5 hours) on a bike tour of this iconic city. All indications were positive, we interacted with them via email, debated whether one of our party would be able to physically deal with the tour and they were made aware that we would be arriving into Amsterdam slightly in advance of the tour starting and may be arriving close to the start time, possibly 5 to 10 mins late depending upon Amsterdam traffic from the central station at their location. Through all our interactions, there was no suggestion that there would be any problems with arriving a little late.However, this is when the problems started. We arrived at the shop 5 mins past the hour (as already communicated) and were told that we were too late, as the group was already in the middle of the safety briefing! This involved much ringing of bells the whole time we were trying to get onto the tour. They stated they could not pause the safety briefing just for us and did not have the capacity to give us such a briefing (quite interesting, as there were at least 3 staff standing around chatting and drinking coffees). No amount of referencing email discussions, the fact we were only in Amsterdam for 5 hours and we were there and ready to go moved this person. She simply said, \u201cyou\u2019re too late and that\u2019s that\u201d. They obviously had enough on their tour already and really did not have one ounce of consideration for the customer. When it became obvious that this person was not going to change her mind (the other staff seemed v uncomfortable standing around as we discussed this), it was like pulling teeth to get her to give us advice on what we do / whether there were any other tour operators she could suggest we use \u2013 on the one hand unwilling to pass the business onto the competition, but also completely inflexible in their interactions with customers!!In summary, very disappointing from an obviously successful and \"apparently\" professional outfit who lack any ounce of customer service and are very inflexible. I would highly recommend avoiding them and go with another more customer-oriented service, such as Green Bikes and King Bike next door. Reviews on them here"

Also, apparently they have a cat in the store and I don't like cats so I was anxious to leave because of that situation.It was raining, rather pouring rain and they provided us with rain ponchos. However make sure you get something other than the red ones, because that's what I had and it was worthless.

Our group of nine (including Alec) spent about three hours cruising all of the sights of Amsterdam from the well-known to the just plain interesting. At the end we all biked to a local pub for a drink :) Great way to spend an afternoon in the city."

It was a perfect intro to the city and Aaron, having lived there for decades, was able to give us a knowledgeable tour with a great Californian vibe. He knew so much and really connected with our whole family. This tour really set the tone for our whole trip and got us really comfortable with the streets of Amsterdam very quickly.Aaron was also really flexible about where we went, giving us a ton of discretion and taking us to a fantastic apple pie place for a short break.I will probably do this again every time I go to Amsterdam."

I visited Amsterdam for the second time in early December 2015 and decided to book a bike tour at Mike's Bike Tours after reading about them in my Lonely Planet guidebook. They sounded like a fun bunch and the kind of place I'd like to be. I wasn't wrong! Mike's Bike Tours is full of fun people who have brilliant knowledge of the city and delivered the tours in a fun yet informative way. I've always wanted to ride a bike through Amsterdam but was worried about getting lost and wasting my time on the bike by looking at my GPS or my maps, so taking a tour was a brilliant way to ride a bike through the city and maximising the time I had.Our guide from Mike's Bike Tours was Vincent who led a great tour and was full of facts and information on the city. The most interesting to me was the history he told us on the Jordaan area of the city.The tour culminated in a drink in a local bar (the name escapes me, but I do have a card at home!) where we all enjoyed coffees and Amsterdam brewed beer which was the perfect ending. Thanks so much Vincent and Mike's Bike Tours - I would highly recommend these guys!"

I'm a travel writer/blogger and found out about the tour through an acquaintance's blog. The three of us definitely wouldn't consider ourselves to be avid bikers, but we still had a great time learning about the history of Amsterdam and peddling the country side. Alec constantly had great bits of info to add and it made the trip really interesting. We felt that the tour was a great value for the price. Due to our visit being in the off season, we actually ended up having a private tour, just the three of us. We bought more cheese than planned at the farm, and are still enjoying it back in the states. I would highly recommend doing this tour if you're considering biking in Amsterdam."

They understand that there is a lot of bike theft in Amsterdam (as in people setting down their bikes and people come up and swipe the bike). I would definitely recommend buying the insurance with the bike rental (\u20ac2 instead of \u20ac300 for a new bike, no brainer). We did not do a bike tour but did our own trip up to Marken. The bikes did really well in and out of Amsterdam and I really appreciated that there was no big sign on them advertising that we were renting the bikes. They also provide lights for the front and back of the bikes, since all bikes must have these in Amsterdam, along with a bell. From the research I did before renting here, Mike's bike rentals were cheaper than many other places and I liked the before 6 pm rental for bikes which was very convenient for us. If you want to rent bikes in Amsterdam, rent them from here."

Our fearless female guide, Mike, was absolutely hilarious and successfully navigated our group of around 20-25 out from the busy city center to the quaint, verdant countryside. We saw a real windmill, visited a farm where wooden shoes and traditional gouda was made, and just loved winding through the parks, along the canals etc. Definitely recommend packing a lunch.

Turn out to be my lucky day as I was the only one in the rainy day and get to have a private tour with the lovely guide, Alec! He is very knowledgeable about the country's history & sights, and he speaks with much passion and interest which makes it so much more interesting. Alec is also very patient and just a very genuine nice & down to earth guy whom I really enjoyed our conversation while riding along the beautiful countryside. The path that we took along the Amstel River, polder lanscape, passing a windmill and the parks were really serene and such a good way to explore the Amsterdam's countryside. Even though it was raining on & off but it really doesn't matter and it's quite refreshing in fact.This is definitely the highlight of my trip in Amsterdam & I highly recommend joining Mike's bike tour. Thanks Alec for making my trip in Amsterdam such a memorable one, a good way to end my 6 weeks Europe trip! Cheers, Dennis"

We did a lot of research to try and find the best one and we were not disappointed it was really great. We were a little nervous about biking on the streets of Amsterdam so the countryside tour was just what we wanted. It was 4 hours long but by no means strenuous with lots of stops to take things in. The bikes were comfortable and our guide Sam was really easy going, patient and helpful. You don't really get much time to eat so I would recommend packing some snacks that you can eat quickly and perhaps eat something light before beginning. The tour itself spends sometime on the streets of Amsterdam although I was too busy focusing on riding to really take things in too much, then you get to go through Vondel Park. Next is Amstel Park and a stop at a rowing lake. After that you stop at the Riekermolen Windmill, which was great because we really wanted to see a proper windmill and were not sure how else we would have been able to, then you go through the Amsterdam Bos Park (forest). One of the most interesting parts was we stopped at a cheese farm outside of Amsterdam. The farmer shows you how they make Gouda cheese the old fashioned way which is pretty cool and in the end you can buy some. They also make clogs and he shows you that too. It was very cool and something you surely would not get on other bike tours. In the end we had to cross the Amsterdam Marathon which was a little crazy, but Sam did a great job of making sure everyone was okay. Also it was a little bit of a rainy day but that did not take away from our experience and they provide you with ponchos if you need them. Overall it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and I would definitely recommend having it on your list. Probably one of the best things we did on our honeymoon."

The trip guide ' Diego ' was very informative and attentive. We were shown practically the entire city and some very interesting places with their history and importance ( Vondelpark , Skinny bridge , Red Light district , the brewery /windmill , the Rijksmuseum , etc ) This tour is recommended to all visitors coming to Amsterdam , as u really get a feel of the city in the Dutch style .

Overall, the tour was well planned and the sights were interesting and fun. I especially liked visiting the countryside family owned farm - it was definitely the highlight of the tour and probably the saving factor on why I am reviewing this as average instead of poor.My biggest complaint was my tour guide. Stuart wasn't a bad guy, just an inconsiderate tour guide. My tour consisted of around 15 people, where not everyone was at the same physical fitness level. I am in my twenties and pretty active (no where near marathon runner, but I am not a couch potato). The tour guide was biking at an extremely fast pace. For example, the tour guide would be multiple kilometers in front of the last person. Furthermore, after seeing the distance between all of the bikers, he continued with his pace. After 20 minutes into our longest stretch, he realized he has lost half the group and instructed those who could actually keep up to wait, relax, take pictures until he returned. After collecting the other members of the tour, he breezed by us, didn't wait for a briefing and continued to bike ferociously down the path leaving my friends and I to quickly hop on our bikes and huff and puff to catch up. Finally, the biggest problem was after about 10 minutes into the tour one of the participants lost the group. Instead of calling or going back to the store front location he used google maps to find us at the country side farm. The tour guide DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE HE WAS MISSING SOMEONE..... How horrible. For a seasoned tour guide to not even realize he didn't have his entire group was telling enough. The participant had to use offline GoogleMaps because he was American and did not have cell phone reception in the Netherlands to locate us. And GoogleMaps ended up leading him down a path with a fence that he had to hop over and throw his bike over! Ridiculous.Tip, go on the country side tour, just get a different tour guide!!!"

Our guide Stewart (English) was really very good, with a great sense of understated English humour and very informative (read - not boring stuff). A really great outing and good to see a bit of the countryside around Amsterdam. We all enjoyed it thoroughly.There are two reasons I have not given it a full 5 stars. 1. When we arrived the owner had just realised that there was an overbooking/cock-up and he stomped around cussing and swearing loudly. It made us very uneasy and several of us moved out onto the street to get away from his histrionics. Not very professional to vent your ire in front of your clients.2. There was a stop at a chess/clog factory (not sure how realistic this was though). The farmer telling us about the cheeses was quite funny and entertaining. The chap in the clog section was really quite shocking. His jokes were rather patronising and often bordered on the racist. Very unpleasant."

I was really keen on going for a bike tour while staying in Amsterdam and I made the perfect choice by going for a countryside tour with Mike's bike tours and rental! I was taking the tour on 1st November, the day when the shop was moving across the street. Despite all the hassle with moving, everyone was well organized, very polite and nice - great customer service! As there was almost 30 visitors, they split us up into 2 groups, I went for a tour with Stuart (hope I spelled the name correctly!) and it was just lovely! Unfortunately the weather was not very tour-friendly as it was very foggy for the first half but we managed and got some sun after we left the clogs and Gouda farm. I haven't sit on a bike for almost 10 years so was a bit afraid of the 25ish km tour, but it was as easy as it could be! Even the bits of cycling in the town were managable. The countryside is all flat, so you don't really need to be in good physical shape to finish the tour. Definitely recommend taking this tour if you want to get to know Holland a bit more! Also Stuart was very knowledgable about history of Amsterdam and it was a delight to have him for a tourguide. I would definitely go again!"

The ride was easy (haven't ridden a bike for 15 years and wasn't sore at all the next day), though was very glad to be in a group on the tour as the Amsterdam streets can be a little crazy to the uninitiated individual who is used to being on the other side of the road! Even though we had poor weather (raining all day) it was still a great experience and I would recommend this tour to all."

My group leader only stopped at the I Amsterdam sign. But after that it was just a ride around the streets, so became a bit tedious as we were not told any of the history or attractions. Other groups did stop at various points and had a chance to take photos. It may depend who you get as your group leader as to whether you get to stop of not. The bikes were comfy though and riding around the city was an experience I enjoyed."

The ride was beautiful biking through the countryside along the canals and seeing the farms. We got to see an old windmill before stopping at the gouda cheese farm where they also make wooden clogs. The farmer was funny and showed us how the cheese and clogs are made. On the way back we rode through two gorgeous parks including Vondelpark.

We had 21 people in our group- way too many, I think, for safety, although we didn't have any problems. And also too many to really hear the guide when he stopped to give us some info.I found the guides affect to be very flat, didn't sound particularly interested in what he was telling us, seemed to be more interested in his hair and the few young single women!Nevertheless, the city part of the ride was short and fun (though a little stressful with the traffic) and the ride through Vondelpark, Amsterdam forest and the countryside was quite pleasant.Cheese and shoe-making demo, a little hokey, but OK!Route was flat, no problem going the distance."

I was super nervous but the team at Mike's Bikes made me feel safe, fit me with the perfect bike and took the stress off my shoulders for the day. I'd say the route was 98% flat, 80% very minimal traffic and at a perfect cruising speed. The scenery is so incredibly beautiful and the cheese was the tastiest I've ever had.

The souvenir shop plays, like most others, only to outdated stereotypes. Also, there was really no place at the farm to eat the food Mike had encouraged you to bring because the two picnic tables were covered in a hardened green slime of some sort. I guess Mike expects you to eat while standing, like the cows. But how was the play Mrs. Lincoln? Actually, not bad. Peter, our tour leader, was very knowledgeable, interesting, and well-spoken.

Mike's Bike Tours was thee best thing we could have done. Our tour guide was the guy from Canada and he was hilariously fantastic. I can't think of a better way to see this fabulous city. Side note: you better get a fast start for riding over the canal bridges. Some of them are steep!"

So we did our research on Trip Advisor and found Mike's Bike Tours and it was only a 30 minute walk from our hotel. So we walked there the day before we wanted to take the tour and booked it for the following day! It was everything we were hoping for and more! Started the tour at 11:00 am, which gave us plenty of time to walk to Mike's Bike Tours and even had time to grab a late breakfast right around the corner. Bike tour took us out of the city and into the surrounding country side of Amsterdam. Stopped a wind mill for pictures and then at a local dairy farm where we got to taste a bunch of his artisan cheeses...oh my stars...was the best cheese ever! We loved it so much we bought some to bring back to Canada , so it toured with us all through out Europe for almost 4 weeks. Because it was wrapped in wax, it made it home safely! There was also a clog demonstration at this local farm and a great gift shop where you could purchase their cheese and clogs and lots of other amazing souvenirs! Then we had time at this farm to eat our lunches that we brought along out on some picnic tables they had there for all the cyclists on our tour! Had a lovely trip back to the city and we were so thankful we booked such an amazing biking tour. Lots of fun and great way to see Amsterdam and country side! Would definitely book with Mike's Bike Tours on our next trip to Amsterdam!"

The difference was that the guide only lightly touched on the red light district and we didn't ride through it. Our tour was great. We did it on the first full day we had in Amsterdam and the information and history given on tour was very helpful for our following days in the city. We knew where things were and what we wanted to go back to. Amsterdam is a fabulous city for bike riding. Bikes rule, and everyone gives way to the bikes. Very safe and easy riding, and the bikes are so comfortable. It's a bit weird at first because you sit upright and your seat is low so you can touch the ground with both feet. The design of the bikes make this work though. Very cruisy and fun."

Seeing breathtaking views and crazy Dutch buildings and genius ingenuity I was in awww of Amsterdam and thank Sam for teaching me the bike edict and history of the Dutch. What a people, I love them. This should be your first stop to learn the amazing bike ways and some Dutch culture then when you are on your own you can rent a bike from Mikes. You must have a bike here bikes rule.

His approach is relaxed, at times irreverent and thoroughly entertaining. You will learn about Amsterdam and it's past, but he'll throw in a fair amount of more recent 'history' and social comment that lifts the tour out of the ordinary. It's great value for money, explores some of the less 'touristy' streets and gives an interesting insight of modern Amsterdam.If you're easily offered then don't go. Sex, drugs and rock'n'roll are all part of Amsterdam's vibe and life, and any tour that ignores this so as not to offend isn't truly representing the city. Geoff puts it all into perspective from a personal viewpoint and leaves you thinking that other cities / countries could learn something (even if you don't personally agree with each and everything). Don't do this tour if you're going to stress about timetables. Our three hour tour happily turned into a four hour tour as our group (between the ages of 20 - 60 I'd guess) generally got on well, enjoyed Geoff's chatty presentational style and relaxed for quite some time at the windmill / IJ Brewery, where I can thoroughly recommend the beer, sausage and cheese!"

Do not be intimidated by the \"cyclopaths\" you may encounter in the city. The bulk of this trip is spent out in the open, riding along scenic paths and taking in gorgeous views of the Dutch countryside, as opposed to dealing with oncoming traffic and negotiating the narrow, cobbled streets with hordes of tourists and fellow cyclists. We made a stop at De Riekermolen, a historic polder drainage windmill that dates back to 1636, and the visit to the cheese farm and clog factory was most enjoyable - I even got to feed the cows! The farmer Roel is quite the character; at one point he grabbed my phone and proceeded to take selfies. All in good fun, and entertaining nonetheless! Plus, he makes seriously good cheese. Speaking of food, be sure to pack a small lunch to bring on this journey. The bikes we got had a basket in the front, which was very convenient as I was able to place my small messenger bag and lunch in it for the ride. All the bikes had proper names, so if you see \"Coffee Racer\", say hi for me!Last but not least, our guide Sam was wonderful. He was affable and willing to answer tons of questions. He quickly sprung into action when a senior lady in our tour got separated from the group by following local cyclists at a busy intersection. In the end, we all made it back safe and sound, and happy to have chosen Mike's Bike Tours.  I'd definitely be interested in longer bike tours to the Dutch countryside, if they were to offer them."

He explained the basics of the bikes (7 speed, very easy), and what to do if you become separated (you have to ride through city to get out in the country). We went off with a group of about 14, riding through the country, stopping at an old windmill, a cheese making / shoe making (wooden clogs) farm, and a few other beautiful spots.The farmer making the shoes was incredibly charismatic and entertaining, couldn't take our eyes off him! Afterwards you go through the gift shop where you sample cheese that they make and can buy it for \u20ac8 for a small wheel or \u20ac11 for a larger one; that cheese is great! Highly recommend this tour, don't forget to pack a lunch (not included and nowhere to purchase on the way)!

Chose Mike's bikes to do a bike tour in the countryside mainly because I couldn't find any others that were still offering the countryside tour on the day we wanted to go. And how glad were we that we went with Mike's bikes ...VERY. The shop was easy to find, the staff were friendly and helpful and our guide Sam was fabulous. He was very funny, knowledgable, down to earth and just a really interesting guy. The tour took us cycling down the Amstel river first to a windmill and then to a cheese farm where they also made clogs. The farmer was definitely a character and there shop where they sold cheese, clogs and souvenirs were very reasonably priced. I bought a little clog shoe key ring which was 1,50 euro. In the souvenir shops in the city they were charging anything between 4 and 5 euros! I thought the tour was then over and we'd be cycling back to the city however we carried on further out of the city and then into their Forrest. Stopping along the way on several occasions for Sam to show us things or explain bits about where we were. Had a fabulous time and would thoroughly recommend them not just for the countryside tour, they hire out bikes and also do city tours. Go try them out you won't be disappointed."

Laid back tour guides, no agenda, and even a stop at a pub. One tip would be try to ride near the front of the pack. My group had 15 people and part of the time I was the last guy, and part of the time the first guy, much smoother near the front."

We were suitably kitted out for the weather conditions with a Poncho and given a pre cycle briefing. There was around a group of 12 of us which followed Pete around the city. We stopped at various points and were given some history about the different parts which broke up the cycling. Towards the end of the cycle we enjoyed a few cold beverages in a local bar which went down well making the tour last around four hours. Well worth the money spent. Ridding in the city is a bit daunting to start with but once you've got to grips with the fact that you just need to have eyes everywhere its an enjoyable and fun way to see the place. Despite the monsoon rain shower we cycled in this was by far the best way to tour the city and a must do whilst in Amsterdam. Highly recommended."

I'm guessing if we just came on our own we would probably have been in a smaller group.The bikes were in good condition and better than the ones we had on our last bike tour.The tour itself let us see a good amount of the city and was at a leisurely pace. The guide didn't really talk to much about the places so it was more of just looking around than actually learning about the sites. All in all an enjoyable tour."

We ate lunch at the cheese farm. Great experience."

This was my second time going to Amsterdam and the city isn't that big so I wan't to get out and enjoy the countryside a bit more. The staff at Mike's are extremely patient and well versed. They made the trip fun. Roundtrip the country tour is approximately 18 miles and I'm not in the best of shape and had no problems at all. The terrain is easy and flat and the scenery is amazing! I was a bit intimidated in riding a bike in the city, but it's not far from Mike's until you are in the country. The group stays together so no one gets left behind. Thanks to the wonderful guides at Mike's!"

You could just rent a bike, but dealing with the traffic including all the other bikes would be trying for the neophyte.The bikes are California cruisers, if you want to ride Dutch bikes try another company. They are well maintained. The staff are knowledgeable and actually quite funny.WARNING. The afternoon tour includes a walk through the red light district which despite all the tourists is a working red light district. If that offends you take another tour.There is a nice visit to a Brewpub under a windmill at the end."

My husband and I are not novices to the bike tour scnene.....it's really the first thing we do when we come to a city and unpack in our apartments. Peter was wonderful, adding humer and historic information at every stop. Some people just didn't get the joke.....perhaps they just need to lighten up. Amsterdam is a very tolerent and progessive thinking community....as the saying goes....when in Rome.....you get my meaning.The tour was great! Rain, wind and anything else.....bring it on. Peter knows the city and the 3 hour tour went by like nothing at all. If we lost bikers at lights, he waited and rescued. He never lost sight of our crew....as annoying as it was every once in a while.Last stop was an infamous \"brown cafe\"....he layered up the bikes, locked them up and we stolled in like royalty. A couple of shots and beers and we were dried up and ready to ride back to our starting base. Let me tell you the rain was coming down in buckets at this point. Good thing we were out when we were cause the last 1km ride was the wettest of the tour!No matter, worth the tour, rain or shine......absolutely a great time :)If you can't take a joke.......stay home!Ed and GretaGeorgetown, OntarioCanada"

The cheese farm was not what I had thought it'd be, but hey! that's what travel is all about! Keep an open mind and you'll certainly have a great time!"

My wife and I booked this tour only 1 day in advance and when we went to the location everything went VERY smooth.We had a bit of trouble finding it since we are from Canada, but I didn't expect to know where everything was anyways.We were given a brief introduction about what we will be looking at and the rules of the tour. Our tour guide gave us a rundown of what he expected from us (staying in single file, giving the right of way to certain people on the road, etc.). He was very polite and professional. He has a very obvious North American accent, but said he had been living in Holland for 26 years (we are from just outside of Toronto and knew the city we came from).On the tour itself, our tour guide was always looking back to make sure the group was still together. He never had to stop because our group was pretty good at getting around. Two girls did get booted from the tour. Not sure why, but our guide mentioned that if he doesn't feel we can handle a bike then we will not be allowed to go on the tour as we were going at 4PM which is rush hour.We stopped in many different districts. Our guide gave us a very brief, but detailed rundown of the history of certain districts and laws such as legal prostitution in the Red Light District and marijuana tolerance. Our guide also made a few funny jokes to lighten up the mood.I would recommend this place highly to anybody who wants to see a complete overview of the city of Amsterdam and just a bit of its history. This was the mini city tour which lasted 2 hours, but totally worth it. If I knew it was going to be that good I would have booked the full tour. AWESOME!!!"

You get out of the city and visit a dairy farm where they make cheese. You also get to see the dutch clogs being made. The reason I could not give this tour a 5/5 was a couple incidents involving out guide. He was funny and had a lot of enthusiasm, I will given him that. The tour, however, started on a rather bad note when one biker decide to go back. When we were leaving, they saw her chain was broken and therefore she was delayed. Our guide proceeded to call her out in front of the entire group for being slow and needing to pick it up. If he had been paying attention he would have noticed what was happening before we left the shop. Biking the streets of amsterdam is a little intimidating at first and I think as a guide it is important to give people some time to get used to it. He instead mentioned her slowness again and she decided to go back. I really do feel like she would have become more comfortable once we got out of the city. I'm sure its frustrating to wait but when you work in the tourism industry you have to have some patience. I just really feel like what happened to this customer was not right. There were a couple other times when the group was crossing at a busy street and I felt that he should have waited for everyone. It is not possible for that large of a group to cross the street before the light changes and people get left behind. Overall, a good tour but the guides need to realize they're dealing with tourists who are not famililar with the area."

Having been to Amsterdam a few times before and wanting to actually see the sights of the city and understand the history of the city, we decided on doing a bike tour. We are go glad we went on the City Tour ran by our guide Stuart. My fianc\u00e9 is not a strong rider, but there was a very informative session at the start of the tour that put her at ease. Throughout the ride their were plenty of stops, so for people that are worried about lots of riding don't be concerned. It's a relaxed pace. The history of the city was covered as well as a few of the more recent developments. Great little touch to have a local beer at the end as well. Don't hesitate to book this tour. It's a great way to see the city"

As I'm not a confident cyclist I was glad to leave the chaos of the city, bikes, trams and scooters and enjoy the more peaceful cycle lanes of the surrounding coutryside. Super tour. Much enjoyed by my husband and teenage daughter with a brilliant guide (Vincent) who gave us just the right amount of information about the scenery we passed. I would thoroughly recommend this tour as a way to get a good overview of the country your visiting."

If you're unfamiliar with Amsterdam, pedestrians DO NOT have the right of way in the Netherlands -- you'll have trams, buses, bikes, cars, pedestrians to navigate. Doing the countryside tour is far less congested. You do have to bike out & then back into the city. Guides are great, funny & colorful(Karl). Stops along the way, the city is pretty flat so this is not strenuous. A stop for lunch(which you bring yourself) at a small dairy farm is great: tour the traditional cheese processing & dutch clog making(the farmer is one of three or four in the country doing these things the traditional way). Go early, buy tickets online in advance."

The strange and funny farmer also makes authentic wooden shoes. The cheese was delicious. Awesome scenery and blissful family fun. Watch out going to and fro the city center.

We enjoying riding in the middle of the city, around the dams, along the beautiful architecture and parks.The guide was very easy going and shared quite a few stories about the city and various stops we made about.If you have been here before or ride bikes regularly, I suggest you just hire bikes and buy cycle route maps...it may get boring for you to ride at slower pace and hear about the regular stories about the city. Tour ended with a stop at a lovely bar.Tips/ advice:- I believe it is best for first timers to the city- Not for you if you want to click a lot of photos on the way as that may not be feasible- try to book in advance and call if possible to make sure you know about any other additional tours on your chosen dates- Wear comfortable clothing and carry minimal baggage with you. Bottle of water is recommended.- There are no toilet or water breaks"

In reality we could have seen double the amount of sights on our own. The guide, while nice, spoke very softly and it was hard to hear what he was saying. On what was suppose to be a 3 hour tour, we saw a total of 4 sights, even though 15 are mentioned on the website. Being a resident of the city, I found the guide's choice of route very odd. At points, such as after leaving Vondelpark, we were taken on a very out of the way route with little scenery and riding for 20 minutes without stopping. In reality, he could have shown us Leidseplein and the Anne Frank house in route to the Jordaan (which is only a 5 minute bike ride from the park, if you take a route that makes sense) in half that time. In any case, it seemed as though the tour was drawn out to have us just riding around instead of actually giving a tour. And finally, I was a bit disappointed that all the other reviews mentioned ending at Brouwerij het Ij for a drink while we were brought to a basic spot just a few blocks from the bike store. I had gotten my family's hopes up that they would get to go, and we had plenty of time left! But again, it seems as though the easy thing was chosen over giving us an in depth tour."

Our guide, Karl was almost like your embarrassing dad with his rubbish bill and ted like air guitar motions. When I go on a tour, I expect the guide to be knowledgeable about the history and culture of the city. Instead, we only learned about prostitutes, weed, a few churches, a bridge, the weigh house and why the buildings slanted. This may have been acceptable, if we weren't just aimlessly riding our bikes for about an hour. As the tour was two hours in duration, riding around for an hour may have been a trick to drag it out a bit longer. In short one of the worst tours we experienced and I feel Amsterdam has far more history than just weed and prostitutes!"

As hard as we tried to catch up, we had not seen which direction our guide went and we were utterly stranded. Luckily, we had a map in our bag and were able to navigate back to the shop.I want to highlight that the situation was handled very well by the owner. He was incredibly apologetic, gave us a full refund, and he had a stern discussion with our tour guide.Before the incident where we were separated, the tour was fantastic. The ride was leisurely (a tad more stressful in the heart of the city), scenic, informative, and fun. Besides his blatant negligence, he did a fine job.

It was still windy and rainy by the time Tuesday came around and we were a bit hesitant to go on the trip but I am SUPER glad we did. Despite the rain and cold I couldn't stop smiling the entire day. we loved every second.Those of us without rain gear were loaned ponchos to wear to keep the rain off and after a quick lesson in how to ride a bike in Amsterdam we were given our bikes and set off (all the bikes have names, I rode Dr Freeze and my partner rode Milo). The initial ride through the city was very easy and helped us get used to the bikes and the roads and how to be considerate of other people on the roads. By the time we reached the countryside we were all confident and happy to chat and see the sights as we rode.Our guide for the day was Mike (not THE Mike, GirlMike) and she was AMAZING. She had so many stories to tell and was happy to answer any questions we had. She would stop the group every so often and tell us a bit about the sights and history of the area. If you're lucky enough to get her as a guide, take the opportunity and ride with her when you can, I got to hear some amazing and fun extra facts as we rode along. She always kept her eye on the group and knew where we all were, there was never a risk of us being left behind or lost.The farm we stopped at was from a different time. The farmer was obviously very smart and skilled and we loved learning about the cheese and clogs made there. Make sure to bring some money because you will want to do some shopping in their gift shop.The ride was long enough to wear us out for the rest of the day but was constantly over flat ground, there were no real hills so it was easy to get used to the gears and cruise along if you needed a break.TIPS:DON'T test your bell!!! They work and you will just annoy the neighbours.Bring food! While you can buy cheese at the farm the ride is long and goes over lunch time and theres no opportunity to buy anything really filling. We brought along a couple of sandwiches each and had them at the farm, after the tour.Bring water! Most bikes have a front pouch so it's easy to bring along a bottle of water and have it in easy reach.Learn which brake is which! It's not the same on every bike and you don't want to go over the front.If you intend to do some shopping at the souvenir shop at the farm, make sure you get a bike with saddle bags to carry your stuff in.Ask questions! The guides are there because they enjoy what they do and love to talk to you so make the most of it.I highly recommend the countryside tour and Mikes Bikes. a highlight of our trip for sure."

Karl was a great guide, funny and very knowledgeable. We quickly left city proper and made our way to the country side; stopping at the cantilever bridge, a windmill and a cheese farm in the first half of our tour. We also rode through the forest. A lovely day seeing the country."

The pace was easy to follow, they were very informative in highlighting Amsterdam biking road rules to avoid any mishaps, and definitely very informative information shared along the way.The view was very impressive, and the frequent attempt to take a photo whilst cycling around the countryside was far safer than in the city. We visited a windmill, rode through beautiful surroundings with houses, lakes, and greenery, and also visited a cheese making family run business who also made wooden clogs. There we were highly entertained by the host at the farm who was full of jokes while educating was about cheese, and we had lots to taste.Really worth the time to soak in a different side of Amsterdam through this cycle.If you need, it would be good to pack some light snacks and water. The bicycles come with a caddie infront or on the sides, so you definitely have space to store things."

Behind a laid-back/'anything goes', typically Dutch persona, his dark secret is that he is actually responsible/well-organised, safety-conscious and a good communicator. Although some of his commentary was 'near the knuckle', he created a very relaxed mood for the group on the tour, which added to the experience."

Our guide was very nice but offered very little in the way of information. We visited a cheese farm, which was disappointing. They had a couple of cows to look at; which, if it was your first time seeing a cow, might have been exciting. We were then ushered into an area to hear the cheese farmer tell us about how he makes cheese. The farmer had more fun making fun of the group than telling us about how cheese is made. We then went to the next room to see how he makes wooden shoes. Boring and a sales pitch. Finally, we were moved through a room to purchase cheese and shoes. All of the cheese and shoes are available for purchase in the city. In short, the stop was a great way to keep the cheese farmer/shoe maker in business. I would not recommend this tour unless you are looking for a bike ride to the country and in that case, I would recommend renting a bike and going on your own tour."

We spent a good amount of time starting and stopping waiting for the second group to catch up due to intersections and just the sheer volume of bike riders in the city. We spent a lot of wasted time going thru a cheese making farm where there was a man who made wooden shoes. Out of the 2 and a half to 3 hour ride, 1 1/4 hour was spent at this factory. Make sure you pack a lunch and some water or else you will be without something to eat for the entire trip. Some of the bikes had side bags to carry personal items.

We chose Mike's bike's as the pricing was really transparent on the website and included insurance plus two locks. The bikes also blend in a bit more than the other tourist bikes as they aren't heavily branded.The shop is in a central location and easy to find. Absolutely no problems and would definitely rent more bikes from here if we return to Amsterdam."

Our bigger group had been split into three smaller groups, and one other guide, named Mike (a woman), looked like she would be fun, too. The pace was just right and it was not a difficult ride at all. Getting out of the city was a little challenging as there are so many bikes and pedestrians on the street, but Peter was good at managing all of us (17 in our group). We rode along the Amstel River, which was very pretty. Our stop at the farm was a good break. My husband really enjoyed the farmer, who showed us how to make cheese, sort of, and also wooden shoes. I thought the farmer was too much of a cheesy (pun intended) entertainer, and not nearly informative enough. After the farm, Peter led us through some polders and along a dike, then through a sprts field and along Vondelpark, with stops along the way for information. All very pretty. Well worth the ride."

I opted for the city tour as I had done the Munich tour many years ago.The tour is very well organised and the staff are competent and friendly. The bikes are well maintained and there are enough to go around. The slightly hippyish appearance and manner of the staff isn't going to suit everybody but there are several other companies doing similar style tours if you want something more corporate. You certainly cover lots of the city centre on a bike and I saw bits I hadn't visited in my 3 days there already. My tour guide didn't try to sell us anything or recommend any drugs.On my day there were over 40 people. We were split into 3 groups and the groups kept getting caught up in the same areas which got awkward.Also, some people in my group cycled slower than an arthritic snail. I appreciate that not everybody is Bradley Wiggins but give me strength! We spent so much time waiting for stragglers to catch up and get across the road junctions when I feel we could have got another stop of interest in.There has to be a market for a tour of 4 to 5 hours of no more than 8 people in a group where they have to pass a cycling proficiency test before being allowed on the tour - perhaps, can you ride one handed, can you change gear, can you get out of 2nd gear? That would attract a more adventurous participant and be more fun for them and the guide."

You will need to be comfortable with no helmets and risky drivers all around you.

Basically, ride with confidence as the Dutch do, stay on the right of the bike lane, ride single file, do not try to cross on a red light or dodge the tram, and don't fret if you get separated at a stop light because the group will wait. It took a while to get out the door, but I was glad to have gotten good clear instructions. Side note: I took a country tour with Yellow Bike tours a couple of days later and they didn't do as a good a job explaining things, so members of our group were all over the place and confused about how to comport themselves. After having tried both companies, I would whole-heartedly recommend Mike's tours over Yellow Bike. Mike's also has better bicycles. They made sure everyone's feet were able to touch the ground from a seated position, therefore the bike felt sturdier and more comfortable. Yellow Bike gave us \"Dutch\" bikes that you have to pedal backward to brake, which is fine, but they were uncomfortable and too high for me. I had to stand on tip-toe (I'm 5'4\") unless I got off the seat, which meant I had to fully stand when I wanted to stop the bike. We shorter women would struggle to stand quickly when we had to stop which led to a couple of mishaps along the way. Back to Mike's...there was a very large group of people for the tour, so we were divided into three groups. We were lucky that our group only had 8 people; I believe it's usually groups of 10-12. We were also lucky that we got Nick as our guide. He was an affable and patient Canadian guy with some funny anecdotes. As a history major I would have enjoyed a little more history, but it's not a major complaint. The three people in our group had an awesome time, and by the end two of us came away with crushes on Nick. So cute!To summarize, an excellent way to see a lot of the city in a short time and have a lot of fun. The general traffic in the city, the mopeds in the bike lane, and the Dutch riders were intimidating, but it just added to the excitement. Also, we were taken through the Red Light District, which I found fascinating. There may be some who would be uncomfortable with the ladies in their windows, but it was daytime and there were plenty of other tourists. Actually, some of the women seemed annoyed that they were being gaped at by people walking their bikes while they're trying to work. Amsterdam is a beautiful and interesting place. Mike's Tours is a perfect way to begin your exploration of it."

Highly recommended tour with a great guide, Mike who is a fun person and she is also really knowledgeable, fabulous host who took us around Amsterdam.Me and my friend - we both loved every moment of the tour. It was exciting, and we have visited many attractions, and learned more about them thanks to Mike.It was a rainy day but the tour organizers were very well prepared and equipped, so they gave a raincoat to everyone on departure.There was also a quick health and safety training before we got on the bikes, and an additional person taking care of the whole group.Our City Tour took about 2,5 hours and was really fun.At the end of the historical \"need to knows\" we headed to a typical Dutch pub where we all tried the traditional local drinks - not only Heineken - then we ended the experience back at the base point.The price and value for money is absolutely fair, gained many nice memories."

Started out with a mini City overview with a fantastically entertaining tour guide (whose name escapes me... perhaps it was Jos?). It allowed us to acclimate to biking in Amsterdam, and gave us confidence in the city layout (i.e., you will get lost!), while informing us of interesting tidbits and background of the city highlights. Bikes were comfortable and the tour was not strenuous. Secondly, we did the countryside tour. 50 people showed up, and they split the group in 3. We had yet another entertaining guide who took us through the city to a windmill and a farm. The scenery was lovely and the tour guide was excellent. Except, I found there were long stretches of biking and I would have loved a few more quick stops along the way - even for one minute just to stretch a muscle. And while the farm (cheese/clogs) was charming, we felt it was just a means for the farm to make money in the gift shop, where the prices were much higher than they were in downtown Amsterdam. We still bought plenty :)Lastly, we rented bikes through Mike's. The prices were fair, the bikes were easy to use, and the experience was priceless.Thanks Mike... we'll see you again next time!"

The weather was threatening and some of my family -- my husband, myself & our kids (ages 13-16) did not have much biking experience.Sam was great at giving a quick overview, explaining mechanics and helping us to quickly navigate beyond the busy city proper. Sam was extremely knowledgeable about the history of the city, friendly and attentive to our interests and needs. He did a great job of ensuring that we stayed together, and knew just when to take a respite beneath the trees to avoid a downpour. The highlight of our time in Amsterdam! Thank you!"

The online booking was a breeze and when we showed up early for our tour Mike himself was very friendly and we chatted about rock n roll for a bit and then he recommended a great place down the road to grab some food before the trip.The tour itself was fun too. We had a great guide named Pete who was witty and friendly and fun and maybe even a little bit hopped up on the potweed which made the trip feel authentic ;) He had great stories and jokes at each stop and kept the trip moving and feeling fresh. Would definitely go on the countryside tour next time I'm in Amsterdam and would certainly use their service in Munich as well..."

We enjoyed our Country Tour with Mike's Bikes yesterday and found the organisation, information and guide great.Our tour was organised without being overly controlled and there were plenty of stops along the way where the guide gave us information about Amsterdam and the area, answered questions and explained the next leg of the ride. The ride itself was not strenuous and no real hills are involved - a medium level of fitness and confidence riding a bike is all that was required.Riding a bike in the streets of Amsterdam is a bit daunting as the rules seem to be being made up as they go along - who gives way to who, looking and merging all seem to happen but as an observer it all looks fraught with chaos. Having our guide explain the basics was a great help.I have seen some comments on TripAdvisor that the cheese factory visit is a tourist trap and yes it is very touristy but is was also informative and a bit of fun - you can take or leave the more tourist focussed bits. Interestingly many of the people in our group purchased products - cheese, clogs etc."

The email correspondence went well, but when we arrived the overall energy of the workers seemed unhappy. Our guide was not flexible, although I book private for flexibility. The tour ended an hour early and we were glad to be done. The country side was lovely and the parks were nice to ride through, but I think the management must be having some internal issues with all the long faces in the office. We asked our guide several times if we could stop to have a cup of tea or take him to dinner and he refused. He took us to a cheese and shoe making factory and we felt a bit like we were on a bus tour stopping at the prerequisite tourist traps. We did enjoy learning about the cheese and shoes, but there was a missing component to the overall experience that left us less than completely satisfied."

As we got off our bikes and went into the barn we were just in time to see a cow give birth. It was a bonus (although some were squeamish). The farmer was charming, funny and also very knowledgeable. The cheese was delicious. Everyone bought a little and we sat outside and enjoyed our cheese. The farmer also made wooden shoes. He showed us how he made the shoes and all the different uses for them. After the farm we continued on our tour. Pete led us through some great spots that we would have never found on our own!All in all , my family would highly recommend a tour with Mike's.

If you weren't trying to catch up to the group, you were waiting for the ones stuck behind at a light or crossing. The guide was funny but mostly uninformative. We stopped 3-4 times for about two minutes while she told us nothing of great consequence. We returned around 3 PM after spending most of the day biking. Overall, the $20 I spent on this is nothing to complain about, but in the future, I'll rent a bike for way less instead of taking this \"tour.\""

It was a great choice, Maria Theresa was a great knowledgeable guide, with a dry sense of humour! This tour is not for the faint hearted as it is pretty fast and furious, but then it needs to be to cover all we did in 3 1/2 hours, including a much needed beer at the fabulous Windmill brewery. When we booked the tour the inference was that the group would be around 12 people, ours consisted of 15, plus the guide. As the person who (happily) opted to be the rear rider, this was 3 too many people, we often ended up split at traffic lights and everyone would be forced to wait whilst the lights went around again. BUT this was certainly the only downside of what was overall a fantastic and great value for money cycle tour, in \"the city of the bike!\""

The complaints that I have about the tour was how fast we jumped from site to site, barely giving us time to take pictures, and how out of control the biking was from place to place. It honestly was hard and sometimes dangerous to keep up with the guide. This makes the tour more interactive and interesting, but for a tourist in th area, the biking was unnecessarily dangerous when going through intersections or areas with pedestrians. Overall this tour would be recommended, especially for younger travelers as it might not be good for someone with weak bike experience or older travelers."

            "review": "Very Disappointing Countryside Tour. I was disappointed with my experience with Mike's Countryside Bike Tour. This company was highly recommended on Trip Advisor so I was very excited when I booked it for 9 people. Here's my breakdown of the whole experience: The bikes: Most of us were comfortable and happy with our bikes. They were accommodating when it came to providing a bike for every height. The countryside: The one bright spot in our tour. Biking through the country side was very lovely. It was my second time in Amsterdam so it was nice getting out of the main city for a few hours. The tour guide: Our tour guide's name was Diego and he didn't seem enthusiastic about the information he was presenting nor taking us around. He was also very impatient with us and seemed like he couldn't wait to get back. The cheese/clog farm: The host kept making these racial comments throughout the tour. We were taken into the gift shop after the short tour and most of our group bought cheese. We were specifically told that we did not have to refrigerate the cheese nor keep it cool in any temperature and it would last \"10 years.\" However, that was not the case. Every single one molded. My husband and I spent over 30 euros on the cheese!If you want to experience the countryside, I recommend you renting your own bikes and doing your own tour."

The safety brief stretched on and I was getting nervous, but about 1130 they divided us into 3 groups to head out. Once the admin was done we were off! Some of our group didn't seem at all familiar with a bike or traffic signals, but things straightened themselves out fairly quickly and I was able to forget about all of that. Karl, our guide, was fun and entertaining. The ride was easy and relaxing. Would have liked more stops with photo ops, but to be honest there weren't THAT many photo ops--one windmill and the cheese/clog farm/shop, with a few parks as well. I'd recommend this if you're looking to get out of the city for half a day, but I don't think it's essential to your visit to Amsterdam in any way!"

This review would of received a 'very good' rating if it wasn't for the racist comments stated by our tour guide and the male owner from the Cheese and Clogs Factory. Pete thought he would humour a family with an Asian appearance by asking if there were any more earthquakes back home!? Insinuating that they were from Nepal! First of all - completely insensitive and unprofessional to be said by the tour guide. Second - how dare you humour the fact that hundreds died!!! Lost their lives and homes!!! Families and communities torn apart by a tragedy due to a natural disaster! Seriously tactless and insensitive - advice, think or don't speak!Second racial discrimination was from the male owner of the cheese factory. I won't go into detail of what he said. The situation was he labelled the tourists according to appearance and assumed they spoke their heritage language whereas these were the third generation who grew up in the US and not in the country of their cultural background. He kept referring to one girl as Korea! Which wasn't her name and she grew up in New York, so she had no idea what he was talking about. She responded politely and reflected the mannerism that the owner lacked.The actual bike tour was really good. Pete has clearly does this all before etc etc Also two girls from our group stopped early, one was asked not to continue and one didn't feel comfortable even after trying. Neither of them received a refund from the office even thought Pete said they would!"

            "review": "Never again, tourist trap!. We did the country bike tour with Diego, and while he was somewhat informative regarding the history of the city, throughout the tour he was not accommodating in allowing us to take photos and also disorganized. It's understandable that the group is on a timed schedule, however, none of the tourists complained when we had to wait over 20 minutes for the group behind us to catch up (they had some sort of bike issue), yet he would not allow us to take 5 minutes at the various stops to snap photos. We did not know how long we had at the cheese farm (for example, no 5 minute warning) and when he said it was time to leave he was upset that some of the tourists had to use the restroom. He rushed us through the rest of the stops after and just kept telling us there would be opportunities to take photos at later points but there were none. When we asked him to take a photo for us at our last stop he quickly snapped one before everyone was in place and when asked if he could take another he said \"no\"! What's the point of going on these tours if the tourists aren't allowed to take photos?Also, I believe the cheese farm/clog factory is a total tourist trap. I bought 2 wheels of cheese there, and I specifically asked prior to buying if it would be okay if the cheese were not refrigerated (our hotel did not have a refrigerator). They said that it would be fine and that the cheeses in the wax casing go 8-10 years without going bad. Less than a week later, both unopened cheeses were covered in mold in the bag. Thats 40 euros down the drain. The cheese farm/clog factory is just looking for any profits they can. I would not buy from there and would suggest going to one of the nice cheese shops all over Amsterdam. Overall the only positives about the country bike tour was the scenery itself. The guide was horrible, the stop was horrible, it was overall one of the worst tour experiences I've been on. I'd highly suggest renting your own bike and biking around yourself! There are bike lanes that stretch outside to all the parks in Amsterdam, and it would be easy to do the country tour on your own. Do not waste your money at Mike's Bike Tours."

Went this year with my 24 year old son and even he had fun! This is a pretty flat ride except going up over the canal bridges which are nothing of an incline. The only problem I had was at the farm. The farmer said that if you don't cut open the cheese that it will make it through customs. Well, in the US you cannot bring the cheese that has the meat inside. I didn't open it up and the customs lady said she wouldn't allow it because it had ham inside the cheese so she threw it out! I didn't even get one bite! So just buy the cheese without any meat and maybe that will get through."

My friend and I had only the weekend in Amsterdam to explore after a work trip and this was recommended to us as a fun way to get a heavy does of tourist in during a 4 hour window. And it delivered exactly that! IF you haven't been to Amsterdam, let me just say that the biking there is intense, and there is no way I would have felt comfortable just taking out a rental without a guide. Our tour guide, Karl \"with a K\", was hilarious and offered just the right amount of facts mixed in with chill bike riding. We did the Country Tour that leaves the city and goes out on a ~15 mile loop to see a classic windmill and to visit a cheese/clog farm. Both of those attractions are 100% geared to tourists but just be OK with that and enjoy it! The ride also goes through some lovely areas and parks. For about 25 quid, its a steal.If you are hesitant because of your biking skills, DON'T BE! Neither of us had been on a bike in several years for any extended period of time and it was totally fine. The land there is fairly flat so it's also not particularly strenuous. Highly recommended! Thanks for the great tour guys!"

I loved that the bikes were just normal bikes and didn't have a huge logo for the company plastered all over them. We were lucky to go on a beautiful sunny day so the experience was great at times. It wasn't all great though. Our group was way too big. We had some very inexperienced bikers who had a tough time even getting around the city. We ended up spending a lot of time making sure these people were safe and didn't get hit by cars. I would have liked it much better if the group could of been smaller.Second,our guides constant talking about marijuana and prostitutes got old real fast as did his effort to hook up after the tour with the single ladies in the group. I understand some people might come to Amsterdam for that but that shouldn't be the overriding theme of our bike tour. We found that very unprofessional. I would definitely do a bike tour again but I would try somewhere else to try and a guide who can tell me more about the city and less about coffee shops and where he can take ladies to after the tour."

This was daunting as none of us knew where we were going let alone felt comfortable navigating the traffic. At some points on the tour I felt completely unsafe riding my bike and heard several other group members say the same thing. The tour itself takes you to interesting parts of the city with a bit of commentary but I didn't gain any further information to what I already knew.

I visited Amsterdam for the first time exactly 10 years ago and my friends and I splurged (at the time) on a Mike's Bikes tour for the afternoon. We had an absolutely brilliant time with our hilarious guide and learned a load of useless yet fun facts about the city and the countryside.Fast forward to today...I was back in Amsterdam for a weekend, older, wiser, and wanting to do the same tour we'd done before for memories' sake. We sadly didn't have enough time to commit to the whole tour (they absolutely don't let you leave the tour early if you're on the tour) so decided just to rent bikes for the day instead.It's true Mike's doesn't have flashy, shiny, or particularly well-maintained bikes on offer to rent, but have you seen the rest of the bikes in Amsterdam? That's not unusual! We were thrilled to find a bike rental for the day was about 1/3 the price of the tour and set off on the exact route the tour was headed.We ended up riding much further than we intended, but it was too lovely not to...by great timing alone, we arrived back at the cheese and clog farm just minutes before the Mike's Bikes group and did the exact same tour with them (for free). After we finished, we were free to adventure at our leisure without being held back by a large group. It was glorious!Mike's tours are great if you don't want to think about where you're going and aren't fussed about waiting for people to stop and take photos. If that's not your things, the bikes are a really great and cheaper alternative."

It was a great way to get oriented to the city and also to how to bike in Amsterdam, which is definitely scary at first. But a great way to get around. And at the end our tour guide gave us lots of helpful info about biking trips going outside of the city. So, the tour was great. But, the problem was the bikes you rent from them are not in good shape. My husband got a flat tire 10 miles out of the city and we had to walk the bike back to our hotel. I was further disappointed that when we called Mikes from our hotel, they wouldn't even come pick up the bike insisting that we bring it back. So take the tour, but rent from a better bike company of which there are many to choose from. You will pay a little extra but its worth it!"

Very informative and covers the past and present events with a cruiser attitude. With a well earnt beer or two; to finish. Well done to Mikes bike tours."

Carl/Karl was our tour guide. He was hilarious and made the tour really fun. You go along the Amstel river, bike outside the city, see a windmill, fields, cheese/clog farm, lake, forest, and bike back in the city. The cheese/clog farm was cool to see as the cheese was amazing. It was a 4 hour 18 mile bike tour where you bike for most of the time. While some claim it is not strenuous, it seemed a bit strenuous especially if the wind was against you. However we had a great time and the bike seats were really comfortable. I miss my bike the 'Grape Ape.' All the bikes have a names. :) Make sure to eat a heavy breakfast before the tour as you don't stop for lunch anywhere. Also bring water with you too. We found the time for guests to eat snacks they brought after the cheese/clog farm was a waste of time."

We heard about this bike tour place from a friend, but decided to just rent bikes ourselves for one day while in Amsterdam. The guys working there were very friendly and helpful. They showed us where to go for a nice ride, and plus Amsterdam is really flat so renting a bike is the fastest, easiest and cheapest (and fun) way to see the city. I'm not lying when I say this was probably the best day of my life. We went to the cafe up the road, bought a couple of pre-rolled spliffs and explored Amsterdam for the day.The prices were deadly too, just a few Euro's. I'd recommend these guys and recommend renting a bike to explore Amsterdam."

We found the pricing reasonable and online reservation process easy and fast. The check-in was quick. Our bikes were great. They were less obvious as some of the other bike rentals that splatter logos all over the bikes. We like to think that we didn't look too touristy on them, although us pulling over frequently to double check where we were going gave us away, I'm sure!So glad we decided to see the city on bike. It afforded us a very different way of seeing of Amsterdam. We were able to do a spa day at a spa about a 30 minute ride from where we were staying in Jordaan, so we got to see a part of the city we never would have seen without the bikes."

The best time we had -by far!- was the trip with Mike's Bike Tours. The place was easy to find in the heart of the city, the tour guide was friendly and knowledgeable, and the bike ride was absolutely wonderful! We went through the city (which I have to admit was a little scary with all the cars even though this is definitely a biking town) but most of the day was spent riding through grassy areas outside of the city. We rode along the river and stopped at an old wind mill for the perfect Amsterdam photo opportunity, then continued to a farm house. There, we were given a demonstration on the making of Dutch cheese, then wooden shoes. Of course, we then were able to purchase either. We bought cheese and brought it home. It was so good we wish we had bought a bigger wheel of cheese! We brought sandwiches on the ride, and ate lunch at the farm before heading home (on a different scenic route). We really felt like we saw a lot of Amsterdam, and we enjoyed a beautiful day outside with a group of other tourists out to have fun. This was one of the best experiences of our entire 2 week European vacation."

The tour was fantastic, led by a native dutch gal. It wasn't dry and boring at all. We really felt like we got a feel of life in Amsterdam. The bikes were SUPER comfy and easy to use. All in all...so worth it. We recieved discount cards after the tour and went back the second day to rent bikes and do some of our own exploring. We rode along the Amstel River (suggested!) Through a cute, neighboring village, two parks, and through the city. For four hours, with the discount cards, and as students, it was 10\u20ac for the both of us together! So great.

Mike's Bike Tour is a suitably cheeky breeze through Amsterdam, a city where the bike is king and where the king and royalty in general appear to be regarded with anything from amusement to contempt if the history we were taught was anything to go by. This is the tour where you don't just go through the red light district you find out about the history of the Amsterdam social experiment with everything from the mass squat of Vondell Park to cannibis selling caffs covered. And you form an entertaining tourist convoy which accomodates seasoned city cyclists and people who have not ridden a bike since they were kids. Our tour guide put safety first and made sure he rescued any stragglers. He was also friendly, approachable and laid back whilst being a mine of information and anecdotes. I came away from an invigorating day feeling i'd understood the character of this quirky city better. If you're staying a few days then book Mike's Tour at the beginning because it'll help orientate you quickly."

The exclusive Jordaan area, the Red Light district, Vondelpark, the Museumplein. Our guide was funny, clever and a great storyteller. The story of the hippies living in Vondelpark in the 60s and 70s was one of the highlights of the day. We felt like we WERE Amsterdamers on our bikes. Cyclists rule the city and it's so great to be apart of this culture, if only for a day. The pace of the tour was great and we stopped for a drink at nearly the end of the tour at a bar in a windmill. I would highly recommend this experience and intend to take the country tour the next time I'm in Amsterdam. Note, there's a really great healthy take out food store just down the street, to grab a quick snack before the tour."

Stuart provided lots of information and history about the polders, as well as the current issues Amsterdam and the Netherlands face with climate change. He was an excellent tour guide.

Four hours of very enjoyable cycyling on a comfortable and well-maintained bike. As a long time cyclist but first time visitor in Amsterdam, the guided tour helped me become more familiar with the rules and customs of biking in the city. Likewise, the tour helped me prepare for 3 more weeks of cycling in the city by pointing out areas of interest and routes I would not have discovered on my own. The tour guide, Alec, was entertaining, informative about Amsterdam (history and present day), very responsive to questions, and looked out for us but at the same time was very laid back and didn't rush the group like some tours I've been on. I'm going on the Mike's Country Bike Tour tomorrow!"

Our guide, Vincent, could have been a bit more engaging. Nice guy not a great tour guide. It was mentioned in the brochure that we could bring lunch. What wasn't mentioned was that if you didn't bring lunch there wasn't a place to buy lunch or a drink. This could have easily been mentioned at the time of purchasing tickets. There was a family with 2 young children who hadn't read that info and they didn't have lunch or a drink. One of the children struggled and it was only near the end that our guide adjusted the bike. There was also no back marker and in a group with range of riding abilities a back marker would have been good. I think it is a but far for a family with young children (8-12 yrs old about), I am not sure if this was mentioned upfront, and they still decided to do it, but perhaps another tour would be better suited. The tour was not bad, but it wasn't brilliant either. I think it has potential to be a better tour but perhaps guide dependent. my sister in- law had done it before and last time had a good guide. It is nice to get out into the countryside and I would definitely recommend it for that, but probably guide dependent."

To our delight and thanks to a great guide who was keeping a watch-full eye on all of us (11 people), we had absolutely no problems managing Amsterdam traffic and bike paths. The bikes are included in the price of the tour and they are perfectly designed for Amsterdam streets. They are very easy to drive and we felt very relaxed and safe riding them.Our guide, Jeff, was in lack of better words, perfect! He managed to take us to all or most of the important places and do it with ease. He shared a lot of funny stories you will not hear from typical tourist guides. And he was very pleasantly surprised by all of us, because we managed to keep pace with ease.

Since that was not an option for me I'm glad I went with Mike's, which had less obtrusive, more basic looking bikes anyhow. Granted, my lavender bike was slightly noticeable, but a lot less than a bright orange MacBike or something. All in all it was a good deal for a basic bike rental. (Now as someone who didn't know her way around that well, I did get very turned around and confused by the extent of the bike traffic, but that's hardly the rental company's fault!)"

Really enjoyed our bike tour through part of the city and into the country .We were nervous of hiring bikes in the City not having any city bike experience, but cycling is one of the best modes of transport in Amsterdam and there is great infostructure. Our tour guide Stuart was really helpful informative and approachable and made the experience enjoyable. It was really good to see a proper windmill and clog making factory if you can call a old Dutch farm a factory =] I have to say the farmer is pretty eccentric but hilarious, \"I don't like men , so come closer ladies \" My misses isn't the stongest on a bike and she managed fine due to good organisation and confidence given from the instructor.If we had more time we would have done the city tour as well!!"

Mike's humour is the best. Traffic whether pedestrian, cars or fellow cyclists fell into a synchronicity that at times fell into the magical. Occasionally we'd take a break and find out about the neighbourhood we were in. Near the end we stopped at a cafe and had a libation. A most excellent way to spend the afternoon."

Cycling is a must in Amsterdam, and what better way to do it than a guided tour of the city with the friendly, enthusiastic, and at times downright hilarious Mike's Bikes? For only 18 euros each we were each given a light and easy-to-manoeuvre bike, instructed on the rules of the road and the cycling bell code (one ring means 'excuse me', two means 'you seem not to have heard me', and frantic ringing means 'get the *** outta my way!'), and then taken on a two hour tour of the city by a funny a knowledgeable guide who would stop us all every now and again for all sorts of stories about the area we were cycling through. My only caveat would be that the roads of Amsterdam can be a little scary, what with the bikes, trams, cars, motorcycles and pedestrians going in all directions, none of whom believe in braking, and while you quickly get used to this, it does mean you spend most of your time with your eyes firmly on the road ahead rather than checking out the scenery. For this reason if you want a really thorough tour, a walking tour might be better (but doubtless less fun!)."

Alec provided an excellent balance of history and fun, and some good restaurant recommendations as well. Our highest recommendation!The Countryside Tour was also fun, but we rated it only 3/5. Pete from Ottawa was our guide and he was excellent. There was much more cycling as you would expect and he did a good job explaining the history of the area. But we spent far to much time at the cheese farm/clog factory. It is a total tourist trap with a creepy owner making us all a little uncomfortable as he tried to chat up the \"pretty lady\" in his lame presentation. The cycling really was fun but the length of time we wasted at the tourist trap was unfortunate."

The bikes are super easy to ride, although it should be said, Amsterdam presents a few more challenges than some cities if you've done these rides before elsewhere. It's a busy city, with people, bikes, cars but as long you're aware of your surroundings it's all pretty easy. This is the city of cyclists afterall so everyone is very used to people scooting around. Stopped for a few beers at the end, had a chat and got the inside word on anything we wanted to know about the city. Just do it. It's a lot of fun."

We took a scenic ride through the Countryside where we visited a farm where they make cheese and Dutch shoes. We did not feel any pressure to buy anything but the delicious cheese sample made it a must.

The route was apparently chosen without consideration for traffic or construction and was a hectic experience. It was so difficult to ride, due to the congestion, that it was impossible to see the city. We only stopped a couple of times for \"information\" and missed a lot of parts of the city that should have been included on any tour... although we did stop once for \"beer\" at a nice brewery in a windmill. The people at Mike's need to spend a little less time being \"cool\" and a little more time selecting an appropriate routes that will enable their customers to enjoy the ride and \"see\" Amsterdam.

We really enjoyed it and it is definitely not too strenuous - quite relaxing once you are out of the city. It was a small group of about 9. Would recommend it if you have a day to spare while in Amsterdam."

It was sooo much fun and a must for anybody!! Even my 80yr old dad loved it (and Mike) :) Mike is very passionate about her city which made the trip even more special. I feel that I know so much more about Amsterdam from doing this tour.So if you want a laugh on some very comfy bikes book a tour with these guys."

There's a gift shop there and free cheese samples. The ride is very nice and flat. It did rain hard on our trip, but Mike's provided the proper rain gear. We still got wet, but it was minimal.As for our guide, he was a self-proclaimed vagabond that was very much into himself. It got old real fast. Then he was basically demanding tips at the end of the tour (so we could help him get to Japan and New Zealand). He had the gall to tell a German couple who was on the way out the door that he wished he knew how to say 'tip' in German. They looked shocked and came back and gave a few Euros.This was my 3rd Mike's Bikes Tour (first 2 in Munich) and the first time a guide has ever been like this. The tour itself is nice but our guide was just a farce."

The cheese farm was really interesting and please note the cost of cheese here if you want to buy it is less than you'll find at all the retail stores, so we wished we'd bought even more. The tour covered windmills, many parts of the city, a working cheese farm etc. etc. We'd been to Amsterdam before but really felt like we learned a lot more and saw much more of the city by doing this tour.

You need to ride a bike while in Amsterdam, it's quite simply the best and most sensible way to get around. Although a bit intimidating at first, I enjoyed biking with a group as it's much easier to get around. We had Mike as a guide, and he took us through the whole city with a few stop offs to get lots of information. We were told not only about the modern life and culture, but we received tons of history on this amazing city. Mike was fun, laid back, and full of information. He even took us to a local beach bar that he loved, and we all enjoyed a nice beer on a sunny day. This tour was amazing, and has really made me want to visit Amsterdam again. If you are looking for an easy way to see the city, I would highly recommend this tour."

The staff immediately seemed more relaxed here and just asked us to hop onto the bikes and away we went. In total, we perhaps did 4 stop offs around Amsterdam and our guide provided us with a brief explanation of each place we stopped off and general historical information about the country. We were in a group of 12 and unfortunately 3/4s of the way through the tour, one person fell off their bike and the guide had to go back to get her. After this incident, she took a while to get the courage to get back onto the bike and the tour guide just seemed to get very grumpy and annoyed with this 'inconvenience' and appeared to rush us back to the place after this incident. I gave it very good as the information he did provide before this incident was interesting but he could have been a bit more patient and allowed the rest of the group to continue to enjoy the rest of the tour. Cheap too!"

So when we booked a weekend trip to Amsterdam, the city of bikes, I knew we needed to do a bike tour. We picked Mike's based on the good reviews, but I was a little disappointed in the actual tour. The guide was great at taking us around the city and the ride was really fun. We got a great feel for what it was really like to get around the city on bikes. My gripe is about the content of the stops. I wish I had known that there would be such a focus on the coffeehouse culture and bar scene in Amsterdam. Yes, I know a lot of people come to Amsterdam for that. But I would have like to hear a little bit more about the history of the city and other things. We did have a few folks in our group who were really interested in this, so maybe that is why the guide focused on that, but I wish I had known this would be the focus before signing up for the tour, because I might have chose something else."

Although the city was pretty crowded, Sam managed to keep the group together and nobody got lost. He was a fun guy and very knowledgable, and he provided us with a very good overview of Amsterdam (and its people) in just two hours. Everyone enjoyed it and I don't think there is any greater way for a tourist to explore the city. Especially with Mike's Bike Tours, you will rather get an idea of how the city is like today (its flair and trends) than learn about years or specfic architecture styles. This tour is really different, and we loved it. Sam was also able to answer some pretty specific questions about Amsterdam's history, so I guess he is flexible on this account. However, you should just accept that any good travel book can teach you about facts and figures, but this is a great way to actually engage with city life. Highly recommended."

Sam was fantastic fun - entertaining, knowledgeable and very much conscious of ensuring everyone was ok and having a good time. The advantages of doing a bike tour such as this one over a walking tour is that it allows you to cover so much more ground in such a short amount of time. For those of you who have done bike tours in other European cities, you may find Mike's tour a little less focused on the history of the place and more focused on learning about what goes on in the city nowadays. A fun way to get to know Amsterdam."

Pete, the guide, amazed all by wearing wooden klompen as cycling shoes for the tour. He offered information on local cycling etiquette, such as using hand signals, that have been very useful. His advice about congested spots in the city was also valuable. Tour highlights included riding atop a dike to the windmill stop, seeing how cheese is made on a farm and wooden shoe production plus a ride through Vongelpark . Tour length of about 20K was just right, although the strong Dutch wind was a factor at times. The tour participants were a mixed English speaking group and got on well together. I'd recommend this tour for anyone who can handle the distance on a bike. It's mostly flat with a few \"Dutch Mountains\" AKA overpasses."

When we arrived with our 10 and 12 year old kids, we were put in a larger group, made up of other English speaking tourists. I was a little worried at 1st that 2 hours on a bike would feel like a lot. I was totally wrong! In fact, I wished we had more time. We saw a good amount of the city and stopped along the way to hear about it- take in the sights and take pictures if we liked. Our guide, Sam was very sweet, funny, friendly, and clearly comfortable with himself and his love of Amsterdam. Riding the bikes around Amsterdam was an adventure- and required a little bravery- dodging motorbikes, cars, pedestrians, and many MANY of the other city bikers. I thought that was hugely part of the fun. I highly recommend taking the tour for 2 hours or longer if you have the time. It was well worth it. On a side note, as a Jewish family with children touring Amsterdam on a day with a big Palestinian rally, I was nervous as our tour ran into this very large presence on the way. Hearing about some anti-Jewish sentiment in Europe at present, I was a little concerned about what might be said. Although Sam did not know that we were Jewish, he handled the presence of the rally on our tour with sensitivity and with an anti-political stance that made our family feel safe and secure. We are very grateful for that as well (particularly in the presence of our children). Anyway, it was my favorite part of the day."

The tour guide was English and had a wealth of knowledge about the area and it's history, and a cracking sense of humour. We cycled through the city and he explained the origins of Amsterdam and the engineering marvel it is. Throughout the rest of the tour he did a lot to explain the development of Amsterdam, and stopping at a windmill, in reclaimed land and water basins really helped to tie the commentary together. Finally, stops at the rowing lake and in the Vondelpark allowed us to understand the social attitudes that make Amsteredam the place it is today.The visit to the cheese/clog farm felt a little touristy, and the farmer who made the clogs seemed arrogant (\"the Dutch still make wooden shoes because all you tourists come and buy them from me\"). The cheese on sale in the farm shop was gorgeous but it did feel as if we were only brought to the farm in order to spend money.Overall, the guide was excellent, the bikes in good condition, and the ride is peaceful and pleasant and at around 4 hours, you certainly get your money's worth. An excellent way to see more than the regular tourist areas and learn more about Amsterdam."

For a tourist in Amsterdam you can spend all of your trip in the city and see or learn not much, the countryside tour brilliantly takes you back to the real roots of the history and culture of the area by going through picturesque landscapes, guides were brilliantly witty and defiantly knew their stuff on the area along the route! Would not leave without taking part in the countryside tour, you haven't seen nothing until you've taken it!"

Did the countryside tour with the partner found it brilliant to get out of the city and go for a relaxing ride to see the other side of Amsterdam, tour guide very informative and entertaining. had a real hot day so made it even better, farmer quite amusing character and can even go for a dip in the river by the farm as it was hot!Amazing trip back to HQ through a number of parks all absolutely buzzing with other cyclists and masses of people enjoying the weather. City part of the tour not for the novice rider though in terms of road sense, very hectic and things come at you in all directions.To nit pick I would have liked it to have been made more clear or to have been told in advance that there is no food available to purchase throughout the tour so you need to being your own, probably essential seeing as the tour runs right through lunch hours."

We were all excited to do the mini city bike tour and see a little of Amsterdam since we only had a day to spend there, but I was very disappointed with the experience and company. On the bike tour, we only stopped a few times to be given info about the site or city. The bike route wasn't that great either, a lot of times we had to get off and walk our bike. At one stop, our guide went on about cannabis, where to get it, how much to smoke, etc. I thought she was going to give some interesting facts about it and how the city manages it but she kept going on about her opinions with medical benefits, smoking it, etc. She went on for so long about it I almost expected her to try and sell us some right there or point us to a place where she gets part of the profit. There is so much more to the beautiful city of Amsterdam than cannabis.It also didn't help that at one of our stops a local came out and yelled at our tour group. Our tour guide and the lady went back and forth arguing because the local did not want us stopped in front of her house. It seems like the company could have picked a better location, as there were obvious signs posted in the windows stating, \"F*** OFF TOURISTS\" and \"NO TOURISTS.\"I thought we would get to see some interesting parts of the city and learn a little about it while on the bike tour that we wouldn't see or find out on our own, but our group walked away feeling like we had just wasted our money and 2 hours in Amsterdam we can't get back."

Riding in the city mixes you in with the other millions of bicyclists, scooters, cars, and trams and there were a few pretty hairy intersections. Experienced cyclists will have no problem with the traffic. Beginners may have some anxiety with the traffic, but the terrain is beyond easy with the biggest \"hills\" being the canal bridges. My wife also went on the tour and she had no trouble with the terrain or the traffic although she was out of her \"comfort zone\" for most of the ride.That being said, I thought the tour was fantastic. Our guide, Mike (not \"the\" Mike) was Dutch, and very funny. And though she was not a Netherlands history scholar, she had enough information to make the stops informative and interesting. The total ride was a little over 8 miles through at least a dozen different areas of town (including the red-light district), including a 20-minute beer stop at a local bar in the Jordaan area of the city.This shouldn't be the first thing you do in Amsterdam, but you can pencil it in for the 2nd or 3rd day of your visit."

Although the meagre cheese slivers offered at the farm were disappointing and we did not relate to the clog farmer's humour, our guide, Carl, was a hoot and did a wonderful job explaining the points of interest along the way, patiently answering our questions and always injecting our adventure with humour and irreverence. I am not a cyclist and was a touch apprehensive during the \"rules of the road\" pep talk. Getting out of the city made my heart skip a beat a couple of times, especially when observing my 8-year old navigate speeding traffic. However, we all made it back in one piece and I would encourage anyone desiring to see another side of Amsterdam to BOOK THIS TOUR! No regrets whatsoever."

We made a stop at the end at a restaurant which I thought was a little inappropriate at first, but there were other things to do than spend money at the restaurant and Mike took the time to sit down with everyone individually and answer questions while there. As tour customers we got 2 euro off rentals later in the week (5-6 euro for all day rental) and went out to the countryside following Mike's instructions on where to go.

A fun, Irish woman that's been living in Amsterdam for the past 10 yrs. It was an easy ride, yet felt like we got some good exercise. We were able to ride for about 20 to 30 minutes a few times which was nice to not always be stopping and starting. We went out into the country to visit a windmill as well as Rembrandt's farm where we learned about them making Gouda cheese and wooden shoes. Very friendly folks. Then spent the rest of the trip riding through the country side and a bit in the city. It's a great trip to learn history and a bit of the Dutch culture. Fun to met other folks from different countries on the trip with you. We would highly recommend Mikes's as one of the must do's for your summer visit to Amsterdam. You will need to bring a lunch and if there's rain, they have poncho, but you could bring your own. A backpack is great to carry your phone, lunch and extra jacket if it get cold. No need for fancy biking clothing...just go and enjoy yourselves, and make sure you ask their opinion on the best places to eat in town. Locals opinions are the best. You can also find Mikes Bikes in other major European cities."

The fact that I'd only slept for 4 hours the night before didn't help. With that said i totally enjoyed the tour. The leader even assigned a couple of more experienced riders to keep an eye on me and kept reassuring me that I was doing ok. The leader is also very knowledgeable about the city and all the sights on the tour. I loved the countryside and the explanations on how they keep the water our of the city. I managed to find very nice gifts for family back hone from the cheese factory. It's a pity though that factory doesn't serve any lunch. I think they should have a vending machine and sell some bread and visitors could make their own sandwiches. The cheese is fabulous Btw...i'm sad that i didn't buy a lot more. I also enjoyed biking through Vondelpark, nice break just before negotiating my nervous self through the traffic again. I'm glad I've ticked biking through Amsterdam off my bucket list, and glad i decided to do it with Mike's Bike Tours"

I liked doing the tour opposed to renting a bike as figuring out the Amsterdam streets can be very tricky. There are definitely street rules that you need to learn before biking. However, if you are adventurous definitely rent a bike there and just explore! The tour was great! I felt more at ease following someone down the streets of Amsterdam."

He referenced the bike staff, mechanics, managers, everyone in the company was always stoned. It wasn't funny and wasn't necessary at all? Other down side was our lunch spot. We ate lunch on some nasty tables at a cow farm. Nothing wrong with the farm, but there were so many other spots to eat that weren't smelly and covered with flys. Maybe it was just our guide????"

The guide gave a detailed briefing before starting the riding. The first part of the ride was quite challenging as we were getting used to the traffic condition in Amsterdam. The ride became more idyllic after reaching the suburb area. Our first stop is the windmill. Amsterdam is not famous for its windmill and this was the only windmill we saw in this trip. Next, we visited a cheese and wooden clog farm factory. The farmers made their own cheese and wooden clogs. We were allowed to purchase cheese and wooden clogs at the gift shop. After the factory, we rode through the lowland (> 2m below sea level), parks and suburbs before ending our tour where started 4.5 hours ago. It was not a long riding journey, but be mindful about the traffic condition. It is important to observe safety rules while riding on busy roads where motorists and cyclists are fighting for the same road space. Overall, the bicycle tour was a wonderful experience. I shall recommend Mike's bicycle tour to anyone who wants to visit the countryside."

My group was fine, it was run by a lovely English guy who clearly enjoys the Amsterdam lifestyle and was out to have a good time and ensure we did too, while also taking our safety seriously. The other guy, however, was a cranky bugger. He did the safety spiel at the beginning and pretty much told us that unless we were very confident bike riders, we should go away and not waste his time. Well, since we had paid up front as part of our tour and had not been told about this before we got there, we all decided to go ahead with the ride anyway, although some of us felt very unwelcome as we had not ridden since we were kids. The group that went with this man all had complaints at the end. They said that the guide basically just took them to a local park, and had them follow him around and around the park in circles until the time ran out. My group was taken around the city (which is what we paid for), but the other group completely missed out on seeing the sights we saw. Many of them felt very disappointed. I'm so glad I got the nice guide!I will say that if you are going with a large group, it does help to be a fairly confident bike rider as you will have times that the group gets separated by traffic etc, and you will need to push yourself and ride quickly and efficiently to catch up with the group. It is a very fun experience (if your guide actually does his job and takes you around the city), but it is also terrifying if you're not used to European roads and traffic behaviour."

This is unheard of in Australia so we took the opportunity to experience the supreme power of the biking experience in Amsterdam. We did the country tour and thoroughly enjoyed 4 hours of lush beauty that is the Amsterdam countryside. The tour took us to a cheese factory, which was rather light on for information,and a clog factory, which was more informative and presented by a rather quirky fellow who was very amusing. We than cycled through the woods and back through a city park, with traffic stopping for us the entire way. It was a lovely ride, however, it would have been more enjoyable if the guide had stopped talking occasionally so that we could simply take in the view."

Amsterdam is a very busy city but Kate did a great job and everyone was safe and happy. The tour covers all the big sites in the city and even includes a stop for a tasty microbrew under a real windmill. While the cycling isnt strenous, there is a lot of bike, pedestrian, tram and some auto traffic to contend with. There are also a lot of quiet streets, parks and dedicated bike lanes too. You do need to be comfortable on a bike but you dont have to be in great shape. I would not prepay and book though their web site next time for a few reasons. One, they have lots and lots of bikes and essentially unlimited spaces so you may want to match this activity to the best weather of your first days in amsterdam. The second is that you get a discount card which you can use on your next tour or rental. We prepaid for two tours so we now didnt get the discount on the second tour. My own issue, of course, but its something you can avoid if you are doing more than one tour. The shop is well organized and the staff is very friendly and very competent. This is going to be one of the highlights of our trip im sure. I will review the countryside tour that we have coming up."

I will say that these bikes seem to be mostly used for short tours & day trips - they are a little beat-up, but they fit in well with the millions of other city bikes in Amsterdam. If you are taking them for any amount of time, I recommend inspecting your bike well before you set off - make sure the tires are at a good pressure, that the shifting works well, nothing is rattling/rubbing, etc... We had one major problem on our trip with one of the bikes (a problem which could not have been prevented, I believe), and Mike's Bikes went above & beyond to help us get everything fixed & back on the road.

Gentle cycling on quintessential Dutch sit up and beg bikes which are really comfortable. Love Amsterdam for its live and let live attitude to all people and BIKES (why does this not happen in the UK and where we live in Guernsey?!). No road rage and everyone manages not to hit each other.After a few city cycle paths, it was out to the countryside, checking out all the houseboats, enjoying the breeze on a hot day. Visit to the farm where we tasted cheese and met the farmer who was quite a character and showed us how to make clogs. Then back through beautiful parks where everyone was sun bathing, cycling their dogs (in baskets in front of the bikes) and even tiny babies. So laid back.There was a range of experience of cycling on the tour but Maaik was great at stopping enough to make sure that she still counted us all in.Totally recommend. (Cannot understand the recent review where someone whined about his wife not being given a women's bike - there was no such thing - they are all the same!)"

Stuart was so friendly and immediately made us all feel at ease. It is very clear that he loves the city of Amsterdam and truly enjoys sharing his knowledge of the city history, architecture and engineering. As we went along, he found spots to stop, show examples of how and why the city evolved and really make the tour interesting and not just scenic. We enjoyed a nice picnic at the cheese farm. The farm was quaint and the cheese was tasty. You can pick up some Holland souvenirs if you are so inclined. And the prices weren't over-inflated. Also we learned a little bit about clogs and how they are made. The gentleman doing the clog demonstration was very enthusiastic and a little eccentric. Very entertaining. I would recommend this tour even if you don't bike regularly. I was a little tired and sore the next day, but there were no really strenuous parts. And Stuart was also very conscious about not loosing anyone straggling behind."

This was to be a country tour on a beautiful April day! We started in the city and made a couple of stops for an informative overview. We then headed out at a leisurely pace and stopped a few times for facts on how the city grew, developed land from the canals, jobs, and other historical facts! We stopped at a beautiful windmill on the Amstel and were given the background on how it worked in its day, the importance of it then, and why it's being saved! Then we cycled further into the countryside to a cheese factory and clog maker! This was interesting, but a bit \"cheesy\"! We brought home some cheese and are enjoying it just as much as when we had the tasting!!The countryside tour then headed through a few parks that were developed \"for the people\"! This was very interesting to hear about. How several generations of political power knew to develop for the workers and athletes to enjoy! I took away from this trip a sense of how Amsterdam has taken care of itself and it's people! It is way more than coffee shops and the Red Light District!!! So glad we did the tour with such a professional, well equipt, knowledgable, and professional outfitter!"

There are other tour options, but I think this is the best. There were 17 of us, all on bikes, led by a very knowledgable guide. In the three hours, we saw almost everything you would want to see in Amsterdam, at least on a \"drive-by\" basis. Parks, canals, museums, Anne Frank house, red light district, capped off by a stop at a giant windmill which doubles as a micro brewery. The windmill was the only actual stop where we went inside; all other areas were simply riding by with stops to explain the neighborhood/attraction. The course is very flat with only a few short \"hills\" to go over the canal bridges. If the weather is nice, this should definitely be on your itinerary."

The stop for a drink towards the end of the tour gave the group a chance to get to know each other and a few of us even went exploring Amsterdam together afterwards. The bikes are comfortable and the ride isn't strenuous at all and it's great fun to see the pedestrians dash out of your way when you ring your bell :) I will definitely be doing their Country Tour on my next trip. I would recommend doing the tour early into your holiday, you will get to see a number of places worth exploring later that you may never have come across otherwise."

The bikes were much better than our hotel rentals and had lots of various pockets to put cameras and bottles of water and things in. Buy a sandwich from Stach just down the street from the office because the cheese farm is an ideal spot for a picnic.The cheese and clog farm was a lot of fun and the windmill was pretty, but the best bit was just cycling along the country paths away from pedestrians and tourists. Even though we were quite a large group, the guide never lost anyone, even in the heavy bicycle traffic around the Rijksmuseum. Having very high expectations after doing a Mike's Bike tour in Munich, we were not disappointed."

A quick lesson in road rules first then we set off into the sunshine. The tour canvassed a good amount of ground, city sights and picturesque bridges, traveled at a good pace and kept the group together despite the crazy bike and pedestrian traffic in the city! Mike was very charismatic, passionate and informative and all in all I had a great time and met some lovely people on the tour. My only advise would be to eat lunch or a large snack before the tour!

Fantastic tour, the first 3 mins are more than exciting... but you soon as you get used to the thousands of cyclists, mixed with trams, cars & tourists, then its the best tour ever. It just really helps having someone who knows the places to visit via the most interesting route. Very knowledgeable guide with a good sense of humour. Cant recommend this tour enough."

For a low price, you get a decent/comfortable cruiser bike to ride with a group (we had 15) lead by a knowledgeable guide. Amsterdam is quite flat except for some bridges over canals and the biking is tame... basically if you are remotely comfortable on a bike, you can do this tour. The guide routes the group around the city stopping frequently to point out key sights and interesting facts. This was much more informative than the hop-a-bus or hop-a-boat tour options in the city. The city tour lasted almost 3 hours with frequent stops and was quite enjoyable. There were lots of great pointers of places you would want to go back to on you own to spend more time. This is probably not the best option if you are interested in taking lots of photos, but you can get some great ideas of where you want to return for your pictures."

I do not like cycling on public roads, but Amsterdam is a completely different and enjoyable experience.

I'm not great at setting off on a bike, and am uncomfortable cycling close to others, I'm not sure whether I'd be able to cope in the summer when I imagine there are lots more cyclists about. Something perhaps for other 'nervous' cyclists to be aware of. On the other hand I ride my bike about twice a year, and managed the ride comfortably, and without incident. So it wasn't that bad :)It's a great way to see a beautiful city. :)"

The bikes were well maintained and Jesse was so much fun. My chain came off - my fault not the bike's - and as I was at the back no one noticed. However, Jesse was back within a few minutes to find me, had me back on track in seconds and back with the group shortly afterwards.The tour goes around most of Amsterdam taking in all the main sights as well as a micro brewery for a short refreshment stop (there is a cafe next door for the non-drinkers/kids). The city is very safe to bike in and we thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon.One word of warning, have lunch before you join the tour (or a very late breakfast!) as you don't get a chance to eat anything until about 14:30!"

Booked the city tour with my girlfriend for my first trip to Amsterdam and her third time.Our tour was operated by Geoff, our amusing Canadian guide who was very insightful on his time spent in Amsterdam and the sights to see. He ran through a quick history of Amsterdam and the surrounding area to get ourselves up to speed with The Netherlands. We then went through a quick safety drill and how to get the most out of our bikes and that was it - we set off to a lovely day zooming around in between other tourists and the hell bent locals.As I am quite tall and easy to spot in a crowd, and not to mention somewhat threatening on a bicycle Geoff ordained me as tail end charlie, and as a show of appreciation, I received a complimentary Mikes Bikes Amsterdam bike bell, which I will be installing on my new bike when I eventually return to Australia!A thoroughly enjoyable tour, and most likely one of the best ways to see Amsterdam, especially if you have little time in town. Even if you don't, still book a tour with them and enjoy yourself!"

There were three of us and we were looking for a bike tour close to where we were staying near Leidseplein and Mike's was within walking distance. We chose the 3 hour bike tour as it was starting close to when we arrived and were so glad we did. Jesse was our guide and we had a great group of people. He vowed to show us all the sights as well as give us a feel for the 'real' Amsterdam and he definately delivered. After this tour we felt like our sightseeing was accomplished and it had actually freed up more of our weekend for museums etc. There was an excellent intro to biking in Holland and how the group would stay together etc. If anyone got stuck at a red light they were caught up within a minute and Jesse even knew which lights we had to cross quickly to stay together. We saw just about the entire city - De Jordaan, Dam Square, Museumplein, Vondel Park (with a history lesson), red light district (with cultural explanations), the port, a windmill and more. I would do this again as it was definately worth the price and the bikes were really comfortable, This tour was suitable for all of us even though we were a little worse for wear and I don't cycle very often, it wasn't too taxing."

The bikes were fine and had brakes on the handlebars - no back peddling to stop! Stuart our guide was brilliant, very knowledgable about the history of Amsterdam and The Netherlands. A great way to spend a few hours."

Carl was our guide and he was very entertaining, he was good with our 10 year old who road up the front asking questions the whole way and also kept the adults interested. The farm visit is a shameless sell of clogs and and cheese, but that was OK because clogs and cheese are part of what Holland is famous for, we bought both! We must have been a bit behind time as the trip back had increased pace and fewer stops, trailing the group out a bit. It would have been good to have more stops and more snippets of information. The ponchos supplied for wet weather were fantastic. Our trip was mostly dry but when it rained they stopped us from getting wet. Overall it was great, and even though the traffic in town was very busy, riding a bike in a country where bikes rule was quite easy."

The storefront didn't appear that organized. But Thankfully everything was fine. The service was good, and the staff was friendly and helpful! But be careful biking around, there are pedestrians, cars, and other bikes all over the place. The bike locks are annoying to use, but unfortunately bike theft is a problem in Amsterdam. I think it costed about 12 euros to rent a bike for 24 hours. Later on I saw a few bike rental places for as low as 9 Euros/24hours."

We instantly warmed to our hospitable, laid back and interesting guide who clearly had a real passion and energy for this city. He made us feel very at ease and wound us through the streets and alleys of his neck of the woods, all the while, explaining what he loves best about Amsterdam. We learnt a great deal and bought a fantastic 'alternative guide' book, which he wrote himself....it's great! The bikes were great and nice to ride. Thoroughly enjoyed our three hours and would recommend to anyone - good for getting your bearings early on. We'll now rent bikes ourselves. Ask for Aaron if he's available....you won't be disappointed!"

Very knowledgeable about the city history and local customs. Also very laid back like a tropical local. We enjoyed every minute of the 3 hour tour. It gave us a good outline of the city and lots of ideas of what else to do there. We took the country tour the next day. Ashley was our guide. Again very, very easy going. He played iPod music while we rode. The country tour is a lot more cycling, and covers more country. The cheese dairy and clog making stop was ok, though we had to wait for the group ahead to clear out before we got our demonstration.All in all, the guides made it a point to keep us happy and entertained, like their jobs depended on it. Good work if you can get it. Definitely recommend them for the first timer to the city."

I was a bit nervous during the ride while in the city- those Amsterdamers are serious bikers and there is a LOT of traffic but Pete was confidant, assuring and got us through! The group that showed up on our chosen day was large and I was initially a little worried I wouldn't be able to keep up or hear the guide's info. In fact, they split the people up into smaller groups and each had their own guide.I especially appreciated riding alongside the Amstel- it was peaceful even though there were other bikers, cars, and pedestrians. The tour stopped several times for information from the guide which was presented informally and with humor but taught me many things I didn't know despite all of my reading about the city and the area.I am not a fan of tourist traps but I truly enjoyed the farm stop. Yes, I knew the plan was to sell me stuff but I can look past that and really appreciated seeing how wooden shoes are made as well as learning about Dutch cheese. We bought some cheese, but passed on the wooden shoes despite the fact that Pete had worn his for the entire ride to show us how comfortable and useful they are.On the ride back, we stopped in Vondelpark. I especially enjoyed seeing this historic and beautiful park which I could not have fit in into my trip. All in all this is a fun way to get outside of the city for a non-taxing ride with someone who knows the area."

The tour was great, very relaxed atmosphere, a lot of fun, and we ended up going for a beer in a local brewery. We took note of the places we wanted to come back to after the tour and during our stay in town. We got to rent the bikes for 2 more days at a reduced price thanks to the tour, and the staff were very accommodating, fun and very helpful. They even helped us book museum tickets, and exchanged our bikes for newer ones as soon as they were available. Thanks Mike and team, you set us up with the right spirit for our visit to Amsterdam. Will visit them again when I come back, and recommend this to people who want a local flavour vs. the traditional standard off-the-shelf tours."

Amsterdam was our final destination on our Avalon Rhine River Cruise. We made the reservations online the morning we arrived. I agree with the reviewer who said at first it seemed a little bizarre during the orientation. Once we got on the streets it was a little chaotic, but once you got the hang of it it was very exhilarating. Our tour guide, Thomas, was wonderful & very knowledgable about the history of his homeland. We rode thru the Red Light District, the Museum District, Vondelpark & ended up at Thomas's favorite microbrew where we enjoyed local brews & the company of our fellow bikers. It was definitely one of the highlights of our trip."

The tour guide - I forget her name! - was a cracker of a dreadlocked Irish woman, and completely fantastic. She was careful in making sure noone got left behind, but you don't feel babied at all. It's still a bit nerve-racking, given the little hills, but the bike lanes and general respect the city gives to cyclists really makes a difference. We went for a short city ride as part of a big group and saw some great sights. The park was my favourite part. It even drizzled and noone cared, we were having the best time. The best money you'll spend on an activity."

The bikes are decent - in working order and comfortable, but not new. Many bikes have a side pouch for gear and the company gave us ponchos for rain (unfortunately we needed them most of the ride). The pace was easy although the route does require good bike handling skills and our 10 year old daughter was struggling at first to mange with the narrow streets and cars, Also note that the Dutch don't wear helmets and none were offered on the tour."

I think our tour was about 4 hours long, and our tour guide was pretty good - the content was sometimes a bit questionable, but nonetheless it was interesting to see the city from a local's perspective. Another reason I would HIGHLY recommend this tour is because it gives you confidence on a bike in Amsterdam, and a bike is THE way to get around. Statistically it is safer to be on a bike then a Pedestrian in Amsterdam, which I would experientially agree with. The roads can be a bit chaotic, and it takes a little while to understand the rules of the road. Take this tour the first day of your visit and then rent a bike - it will make your trip very enjoyable!"

I've been to the city numerous times, but learned more about Dutch history from this tour than from any guide book, and the history lesson was funny and unique, not a moment of boredom. The bikes are not labeled and matching like other rental places, so you feel and look like a local (well, except for not being quite as graceful as people who ride in Amsterdam all the time). The guides take you on their individual tour of Amsterdam, so you get a different feel depending on your tour guide's favorite spots, but each tour does appear to hit the big attractions in the city. It was well worth the price and wonderful fun for a few hours. I look forward to going back to do their harbor and countryside tours."

We spent close two 60 euros for a trip to the \"country side.\" In reality, it took us to a farm that clearly survives entirely as a tour destination and that is just outisde the city in the suburbs. The trip is billed as a 3-4 hour ride, but a good hour of ours was spent on the farm getting sales promos (\"demonstrations\") for the cheese and wooden shoes that are the farm's main products. (No extra charge for canned, sexist jokes.) We could have spent half that much to rent bikes outside the downtown area where Mike's is located and taken ourselves on a day trip to Haarlem or some other nearby town. The country is flat, so biking is easy if you start outside the city (which is only hard because of the incredible congestion). Our tour guide, Mike (not the Mike of the company name) was charming and well informed, but did not make up for the high price and the short trip. Note for readers from Boston -- this was like taking a trip to Allendale Farms and calling it a countryside tour."

We were a group of seven tourists, five American students and myself and my boyfriend, led by Karl the tour guide. It was a really warm sunny day and the small size of the group made it easy to negotiate crossings and stay together etc.I was initally nervous about cycling in a busy city full of trams and experienced cyclists however our entire group had similar thoughts and after a safety briefing and instructions from Karl (\"Stay on the right hand side or you have a death wish!\") and a rather shaky few metres at first, we were zooming around the streets. Karl was incredibly friendly, a brilliant tour guide with a wicked sense of humour, keeping the infamous parts of Amsterdam light hearted. Our tour lasted for 1hr 40mins and was perfect. The cycling wasn't hard at all, I didn't feel like I'd covered 10km of Amsterdam til my legs were sore the next morning! We'll be back to do the countryside tour or the full city tour on our next visit. I couldn't recommend this highly enough!"

My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed riding our bikes around the reclaimed country side and visiting the cheese and shoe factory. Our guide was extremely friendly and the workers we interacted with before the tour were very amiable.The reason for the low review is because of what happened at the end of the tour. Long story short, after being separated from our group because of a red light, a few of us realized we had been left behind and were lost. After getting in contact with the main group via phone, and unsuccessfully being found by the guide, we were told we should find our own way back to the starting point of the tour. With the help of my map and some directions from friendly locals, we made our way back to the tour beginning, only about 20 minutes after the expected time of arrival. While we had been lost in downtown Amsterdam, all in all the few of us stragglers were not any worse of the wear and were still in fine spirits.Upon arrival back to Mike\u2019s Bike Tours, however, one of the workers greeted us extremely gruffly. The worker then proceeded to berate us on how we failed to follow the protocol for if you get lost (which was wait until a guide finds you) and informed us how upset we had made the tour guide by getting lost. It is unclear why he felt the need to speak to us in this manner as we were the paying, foreign customers who had been lost. Moreover, the tour was over\u2014why would we need to be reminded of the rules if we were never going to do the tour again?This was extremely disappointing because we had been in fine spirits until this point despite being left behind by the guide. The way the worker treated us really left a bad taste in our mouths, and soured what had been a great tour. The tour itself was great and I would have recommended it highly if it were not for being treated so poorly. My advice is that if you do this tour, make sure you bring a cell phone and a map because in the chance you get lost, and the guide is unable to find you, you will have to find your own way back to the bike shop. Oh, and be prepared to be \u201ctaught a lesson\u201d by the workers when you return!"

I rented the bike online and picked it up the next day. They do ask for some sort of security deposit for the bike. I didn't feel comfortable leaving my passport, so instead let them take an imprint of my credit card. They returned the credit card slip to me when I returned the bike. I received good instruction as to how to lock the bike (they provide two separate locking systems). They also provided a really easy to read street map of Amsterdam, which I used during my entire stay in Amsterdam. (I liked their map much more than the one I bought at the airport for 2.50 euro.)As it turned out, I kept the bike overnight and returned it after approximately 26 hours.

There were a lot of people doing the same tour as us that day and we were split into three seperate groups each with their own tour guide. Each group contained less than 20 people. From the sounds of things they don't normally have as many people in one day. The tour was only 23 Euros each and worth every penny. We began with a short introduction from Pete who was very funny and clearly enjoyed his job. We were in the last group with Stuart. After getting our bikes we headed towards the Amstel River. Stuart explained fully what route we would be taking and what we should expect. Some basic road rules were also given which was very helpful in some cases. Throughout the whole tour Stuart explained about the area and some excellent facts. The ride was an easy ride and we were lucky to have fantastic weather. The farmer at the factory is extremely knowlegeable and a delight to listen to. The bikes come with storage so you can carry your water and camera etc. The tour starts at 11 and returns between 2-3 depending on what speed the group goes at so you may want to take some lunch. There are a couple of tables outside the farm where you can enjoy your sandwich before continuing. They have the tandem style bikes so that you can take a child on the tour and on our tour Stuart the guide was using a bike with a cart on the front with two small children in it while their parents cycled with the group. Stuart was great with the kids and keeped them entertained. We enjoyed it so much that we hired bikes the following day and cycled through Vondelpark, the forest and back along the route we took the previous day, however, the weather that day was not so great and cycling in the heavy rain was tough. Please don't let the weather put you off though. Rather than sit in your hotel room staring out the window grab a bike from Mike and get out there - we laughed more in the rain!"

We chose Mike Bike Tours, as we'd be able to see more than just the city and go into the Dutch countryside. The tour was fantastic! Our guide was great and we even got to visit a cheese and clog farm, where we could see how they were both made and have a bit of a nibble. The Dutch countryside is beautiful and I would push every visitor to make the time to see it through Mike's Bike Tours."

Our guide 'female Mike' was fantastic and very funny. She explained the tour and directions well and was a wealth of information. Amsterdam if you haven't been is really busy especially with bikes so this is not an easy job with a large group of tourists. The bikes were really comfortable and now thinking about changing my mountain bike for one like Mike's Bikes. Thank you for a great day, a definite for anyone visiting the city."

She patiently and happily answered the constant barrage of questions from our 9 year old daughter, and paid careful attention to ensuring no one got left behind. She gave us a tour of some of the remarkable country surrounding Amsterdam, including a cheese factory and windmill. It was a great way to spend 4 1/2 hours but it is important to note that our guide Mike definitely made this tour exceptional, memorable and thoroughly entertaining!

Our guide Stewart was brilliant very articulate and knowledgeable about the city of Amsterdam. He was friendly and so charming and showed us all the best sites and loads of information on the way. The whole group was really nice and friendly and we had a laugh. We stopped at a small brewery and had a beer which was lovely. I have done other bike tours in London and Berlin which were brilliant and this one certainly is one of the best. The only slight criticism would be the day was really too busy in the centre but that was no reflection on Stewart."

Our English tour guide was hilarious but very informative. He made the tour non-stop fun!! The ride was easy and the views were great! This offers a very different view of Amsterdam than what you will see near Amsterdam Central Amsterdam has a beautiful countryside that doesn't get the credit it deserves. The Dutch cheese farm was also really interesting. I enjoyed learning about how cheese is made and enjoyed the cheese tasting even more. I also got the chance to see an infamous wooden clog carved! I would highly recommend this tour, especially this tour company, to any Amsterdam traveler. When I got back to CA, I was wearing my Mike's T-shirt in the store and when I checked out the sales associate said, \"Hey! Mike's Bike Tours!!\" You just can't go wrong with Mike's."

She gave us historical information with a few of her own anecdotes that made the tour quite enjoyable. She advised us on different must see attractions as well as recommending some great places to eat. After the tour, we rented bikes for the rest of our time in Amsterdam and it was totally worth it.

We had a very informative pre tour talk from Stuart, then the group was divided into two as there were 38 of us. Our bikes were 'easy rider' style bikes, some had panniers, most had a front zipped bag for water/camera etc. The ride out of the city was scary enough if you are not a cyclist. Our guide Mika led us safely out of the city to the start of the countryside trail. The windmill is lovely and not a long cycle. We continued on to the cheese farm. Unfortunately the farm owners have not made any provision for the cycle tours arriving at their farm. The cheese on offer is delicious but you have to bring your own bread/crackers drinks etc as there is nothing else to buy there only cheese and souvenirs. There was only one bench seat for 38 people, we were lucky there were no bus tours in. From there we cycled back towards the city via a forest, through Vondel Park to Mike Bike's office. It was 24 kilometer and took 4 hours with stops, it was an easy cycle, all flat, there were all ages in our group and all levels of fitness."

Very knowledgeable very informative and a excellent city guide. 10/10 for his services. Bikes are big cruiser type bikes and a bit heavy but good conditition. Not my sort of bike but a good compromise I think for all types 10/10We come across this company several times and from reading other comments I can see why people could be non plused. The hippie types are loud, boisterous and one was doing his damdest to win a date with some pretty German girls in his group.I think we were lucky that we got Stuart .

First of all, biking in Amsterdam is not for the faint of heart -- bikers are very aggressive, and you need to be very vigilant. Our group of 23 was really too large to safely navigate the streets of Amsterdam, and our guide, Jeff, didn't seem to care whether the group stayed together, crossed the streets safely, or basically stayed alive. In fact, he lost two of our group in the Red Light District, when the bike chain fell off one of their bikes, and he didn't even notice they were gone until someone brought it to his attention. By then, we were 15 minutes down the road, and he needed to go back and find them. Also, he didn't share much about the history of the city, instead, focusing on the do's and don'ts of buying marijuana and mushrooms, as well as the going rate for prostitutes. I would not recommend this tour for anyone but those who don't want to learn much about the city and who are comfortable being left to fend for themselves."

Bring a plastic one with a hood if it is a grey day. We had a very nice and well planned route out into the country. We visited a cheese farm and stopped to have a tour and sample some of the cheese. Also they made wooden shoes there and we were shown how quickly they can make a pair and which wood they used. They had a large gift shop there and we had time to buy cheese and any other souveniers we wanted. We had previously stopped at a local grocery for lunch items and we enjoyed the shelter of the farms barn from the rain to eat our lunch. On our way back to Amsterdam we stopped at a Windmill and our guide told us the history of the Windmill. The tour was cut a bit short because of the rain but it was well organized and I would recommend a bike tour in Amsterdam. One negative point was that our tour guide made reference to weed smoking a number of times as a great pass time after work and seemed to think that everyone had the same interest. In a mixed group of old and young it wasn't very professional."

Since we are from \"Sunny\" Vancouver, we are use to the rain and biking in the rain. Our guide made the best of the situation and we trekked through the rain in our red ponchos that they supplied. We cut our ride short as not everyone enjoyed the downpour, but never-the-less it was a nice ride seeing the countryside and parts of Amsterdam that one would never see if not for being on a bike.We would do this ride again .... only this time in hopefully when it is sunny ;)"

Karl was quite knowledgeable and interactive will all of us which made it more interesting and enjoyable. Previous to the bicycle tour we did a city bus tour(red buses, hop on, hop off) and it is an absolute waste of your money, there is no tour guide explaining different areas but instead they give you earphones and you listen to recordings, useless. Alexandra and I thank you for the bicycle tour as it was a lot of fun and I'm still holding you to the BQ at your place on the water. :)Thanks again,WilliamOttawa, Canada"

(We didn't go on a tour.) While their website advertises that the bikes are inconspicuous, this is a half truth. While they don't have a giant advertisement going across them, my girlfriend's bike was fluorescent orange. Everyone else in town seems to be riding the old school looking black bikes. This is obviously a minor issue. Th bikes themselves were in good condition - essentially cruiser bikes with the ability to change gears. Riding around town is quite safe. Even the streets along the canals aren't very crowded, so you don't have to worry about constantly maneuvering around pedestrians. We were able to ride to Amstel Park in about 30 mins from the office, and it's a nice ride that I would recommend. There's a windmill at the end of the park as a little bonus. The bike staff were friendly and helpful and this was my favorite thing I did while in Amsterdam."

Staff is friendly and laid back, Amsterdam style. Bikes have Dutch type pedal break but you can ask for a hand break as well, if available. Rental cost EUR 24 for 2 bikes for 24h, including theft insurance. Need to leave an ID or a print of your credit card as guarantee (EUR 250 replacement price -- which frankly is much, much more than they cost -- unless you take the insurance, the bike is stolen and you return the keys to the locks)."

Our tour guide (Pete) was very informative and made sure everyone knew what they were doing and showed us how to adjust our bike seats properly. He was also very entertaining, and made the trip fun but educational at the same time. The tour was around 4 hours long, so take some sun cream (I forgot!) and a raincoat - you can never tell in Amsterdam. Also take plenty of water, but if you forget this, there were bottles of water for sale in the bike shed for 1 euro each. The tour wasn't strenuous at all, the pace was easy to keep up with, and I actually found it quite relaxing!The scenery on the tour was very picturesque, and it felt great to be out in the open. Along the way, we visited a traditional farm where cheese and clogs were made. We were shown how the cheese was made and kept, and how the clogs were made and decorated. This stop was a great place for lunch, and added a cultural element to the tour. You also get the opportunity to taste the cheese and buy some for yourself, as you won't be able to buy the traditionally made version anywhere else! As long as you can ride a bike, this tour is a wonderful way to explore Amsterdam, whether you go as a couple, on your own, or as a family. It is also a great way to meet other people - there was a whole mix of people from different countries and backgrounds on the tour. Highly recommended!"

Mike stopped frequently to tell us about what we were seeing and she always had a good story to make it interesting. We stopped at a cafe for a drink but it was near the end of the tour.

Excellent way to get your bearings and figure out what you want to see and how to get to it easily (not that public transport is hard to figure out though).Our guide was entertaining and knowledgeable. Something that is usually hard to achieve.One thing to be weary of is this is not a great tour if you are not confident on a push bike!! Fitness not a problem as it is mostly flat but the other cyclists, motorists and even pedestrians are more aggressive than you will be as a tourist. But once you get into the groove of things things move pretty fluently.Thanks for the great experience guys."

Had a fantastic tour guide who was hilarious and informative (with the fuzzy hat), and really enjoyed the tour itself - beautiful countryside, gorgeous cheese and an easy cycle. However, there was too much waiting around - 20 minutes at the bakery for people to pick up sandwiches (when the site tells people to bring food!), 20 minutes waiting for the farm tour, and 20 minutes waiting for people to finish up in the farm shop. This hanging around reduced my rating, which was a pity, because the tour itself is great - cut out these, and it would be perfect."

We therefore wanted to take advantage of this single day and see as much as we want to see. We choosed therefore Mike's bike tour which lasts around 3.5 hours. This tours starts every day at 12.00. It cost 20 euros per person. You need not to prebook and we dropped in. There were a very big group on this day and at the start a indrouction to Amsterdam city was given (history) The guide was hillarious and informative. Then the group were divided into 3 different managble gruoups. The bicycle we were given were very easy to cycle and had 7 gears, enough to cycle in the city of Amsterdam. The guide led us through all the parts of Amsterdam and were very informative. The guide was relaxed and did not stress the group to hurry and i am sure every one felt comfortable being in this group. It was a very good and informative way to look around Amsterdam and I would strongly reccommend Mike bike tour to see the Amsterdam city. Enjoy!"

I was in the Netherlands doing a nine week internship and on my last weekend in the country my fellow interns and myself decided to go to Amsterdam. We signed up for Mike's Bike country tour that went a little ways outside the city to a quaint little farm where we got to see how cheese and wooden shoes were made. The farm was fun but what stood out the most about this bike tour was the fantastic tour guide. Our tour guide was Carl and I HIGHLY recommend him as a guide. He was friendly, outgoing and hilarious. He had our group laughing the whole time and was always making jokes. On the way to the farm he stopped off at a great local restaurant called FEBOs where we grabbed some milkshakes and fries. He knew everyone at the restaurant and was even able to talk them into letting me mix milkshake flavors, banana and chocolate was a great combination! After the farm tour Carl took us the back way to see even more lovely Netherlands country side. When we arrived back I felt I had a must better idea and feel of Amsterdam. I highly recommend Mike's Bike Tour and request Carl he is a fantastic bike guide who will keep a smile on your face the whole day :)"

It's definitely not for the faint of heart though!! You are constantly looking out for bikes, cars, trams, pedestrians, and at the same time take in the sights. Our guide was fun and informative, but I would have liked less of the coffee house information and more historical and general info. Towards the end of the tour we stopped in a bar and had a drink and conversation. The bikes were comfortable and easy to use. We took a tram from Central Station to within a few blocks of the bike shop. Overall, we had a great time. I would recommend it with the idea that you're having fun seeing the city and learning about the city in a very general sense. It's not like a walking tour that gives you tons of info, but you could never cover the amount of territory that we did on the bike. It helped us to know where we wanted to go the next day."

On my return home I double checked my PayPal account and saw that the transaction for Mike's Bike tours were completed 5 days before the tour date. I find it very irritating and time consuming to have to request a refund.The tour guide was very good.I was in Amsterdam on a very busy day, so did not enjoy the tour - not the fault of Mike's bikes. The city was so busy that one had to concentrate very hard on the cycling safely and therefor missed a lot. A country tour might be a much better option. I also did a self guided tour through the bulb fields, starting from Keukenhof - bikes to rent outside the main gate. That was excellent and I would love to do that again.."

After an extensive and interesting in-shop amsterdam (geographic, historical, and social) history lesson, our group of 9 pedalled off. Stuart's quick safety tips (which wouldn't pass the US's standards) were in keeping with Amsterdam's laid back attitude. During the multiple stops throughout the city, Stuart filled us in on a variety of local facts, thoughts on regional attitudes, and helpful visitor information. The tour was low key, but comprehensive. It's obvious that Stuart enjoys sharing what he loves about Amsterdam, as well as, being knowledgable about regional politics, social considerations, and quirky trivia. Towards the later end of the tour, we stopped at a pub to sit and whet our whistle and we continued to toss out questions, that he happily answered. Thanks, Stuart for a wonderful time. As an aside, our group rode a mix of bike styles and colors, so we didn't draw an extreme amount of attention to our tourist situation. It was a blast!"

Took a chance and booked a Mike's Bikes city tour on line before arriving, no need to worry its just great, Three of us turned up so we had a personal tour led by Ashley who was knowledgeable and great fun to be with. Bikes v good quality, tour was easy pace, anyone who can rid a bike could manage it. Great way to see the city, orientate yourself and find out things you want to look at further. Trip was so good our 15yr old son insisted we went back the next day and did the countryside tour, which was led by Stuart. This was a little longer but still easy riding and involved a short visit to a small cheese farm - thought this may be a bit 'touristy' but it was a working small dairy farm, and it was well worth going for the cheese alone. Stuart was a brilliant guide and we learned loads of interesting stuff about the buildings and infrastructure of Amsterdam. Great fun, good value - essential Amsterdam experience."

First, if you do not feel comfortable on a bike, definitely go with the country tour. Much more enjoyable and relaxing. Riding a bike in Amsterdam can be a bit overwhelming, especially if you want to be able to enjoy the sights.Our tour was led by Kyle and he definitely was entertaining but if you are looking for information and facts about the city, that definitely didn't happen on this tour. At least he was honest and said up front he wasn't going to make things up. Having said that, it was nice to get out of the city and ride along a dike. We passed some interesting sights & buildings, and it would have been great to actually stop and take pictures but that really wasn't an option. The guide seemed to be more interested in getting us back to the city, so he could enjoy the nice weather. I think our tour lasted less than 3 hours, even when you take in to consideration the review time at the beginning, getting the bikes out, etc. I would have to agree with another reviewer, that any larger of a group would not be fun, since even with only 8 of us, it still took 2 lights to cross most major intersections. Would I use this tour company again? Probably not. Unfortunately, the other one did not open til early May."

We were traveling with our kids who are young adults (17 and 20) and had a fabulous time...one of the funnest activities we did as a family while in Amsterdam! We enjoyed a good balance of history, blunt facts about prostitution and humor. I would not consider the humor appropriate for young children, at least not on the city tour. Perhaps the country tour is more tailored towards younger kids. Riding bikes in Amsterdam takes confidence. Being on the Mike's Bike Tour gave us the confidence we needed to avoid crashing into pedestrians, other bikes or cars. Ballasters along the road....well that's another obstacle that confidence doesn't quite help with :-) ...sometimes, they seems to jump right out of nowhere!We had a great time!!"

I think I would've enjoyed the tour more if it had been split into smaller groups. We just had the lady \"Mike\" and 15 of us. This made the tour take forever because every time we had to cross an intersection (there are A LOT of intersections)- it would take at least 2 light cycles to get us all through before we could continue. So a lot of stopping, and since I was at the back, if she was talking I certainly couldn't hear her 14 people back. She had a great personality, was entertaining, and gave us some fun facts, but she didn't really help me get my bearings for where we were in Amsterdam as we weaved around town- though I'm sure it's not easy to do in this city anyway. Didn't get a whole lot of history from this tour besides the introduction we had in the bike shop. Still a fun way to pass the morning, just would be better if they split up the groups or limit the amount of people they'll accept in a morning."

Although it seemed a bit intimidating as the Dutch ride their bikes quite confidently we were able to catch up on the rhythm of the traffic quite quickly.

One of my favorite stops was the windmill/brewery, some extremely tasty beer in there!!!Karl being himself (biggest hippy in the world) meant many references to pot smoking and other drug use, but this is Amsterdam and he's such a hippy that I expected nothing less but if you're easily offended or frown upon drug use, prostitutes etc it's not for you. That said, it wouldn't be ideal for children unless the tour is varied / toned down to accommodate children.Overall well worth 20 Euros (17 for my partner as she's a student) and it was the best part of our trip."

Saw places we wouldn't have seen and things I doubt we would have heard on some more mainstream city tours, with two timely and welcome refreshment stops.Despite the freezing February weather, nine turned up for the tour and under Karl's idiosyncratic and funny leadership the group quickly 'gelled' and there was a lot of chatting and joking which helped to make this one of the highlights of our four days in the city - it was certainly the best-value twenty Euros we spent while we were there. If you are offended by the sprinkling of info on prostitutes and marijuana cafes then it might not be your thing (and you probably shouldn't have come to Amsterdam in the first place!), but can only say that we were still talking about our Mike's Bike Tour on the flight home to Stansted.

The cheese and clog factory was OK, and you get a chance to buy from their shop at the end (of course...).

The bikes are well serviced and the tour takes you to all the best sites in Amsterdam. Definitely worth a go, and also great place to meet other like minded people. Tour starts at midday and is 2.5-3.5 hours. (this was the city tour). WELL WORTH THE MONEY"

My husband and I joined a group that totaled 14 (from all over the world) on a 12km bike ride and had a great time. Ashley was our guide (and comedian) that led us out to visit a windmill and a farm that makes cheese and wooden clogs (one of only 5 left). The ride was easy (even for my out of shape husband) because it's completely flat, except for the bridges over the canals. The country side is only 30 mins bike ride out of the city of Amsterdam and well worth the experience."

Nice journey through the city, then country, then back to the city via Vondel Park. Stops along the way to learn a little about Amsterdam. Stopped to see how they make wooden shoes and the local cheese. Given that there is around one bike for every person in Amsterdam, you never really feel at risk while riding through the streets. They are used to it there. If you have the energy (and it doesn't take that much), this is a great way to see some of Amsterdam."

But, for me, the countryside tour was perfect, easy, and relaxing. As long as you can ride a bike, you can do it! We rode about 20 Km. from the middle of Amsterdam, to the Amstel River, then along it to outside of the city. We stopped at a windmill, then at a cheese farm and wooden shoe maker's. We continued on to some dikes then back into the city through a couple of large parks. We were gone about 4 1/2 hours. The bikes are well used and only have about 3 gears, but are perfect for this ride which is on flat ground. Our tour leader, \"Mike\" (not the owner, and a female), was great fun. It was a perfect fall day in early October. It was really nice to get away from the busyness of the city and into the beautiful countryside, and to also learn a bit of Amsterdam history. I love walking Amsterdam and visiting all of the museums, but the bike ride with Mike's was the highlight of my visit to the city."

Being an avid cyclist I looked forward to this, I am 70 and bike a couple of thousand road miles a year in Middleboro, Ma. The guide Peter was an unbelievable font of all things Amsterdam and an excellent guide. I don't regret the tour, however bicycling here is not IMHO, is not the best way to see amsterdam. For two and a half hours you must constantly be alert for pedestrians, cyclists, scooters, cars, and trams. There really is no way you can cycle and see the sights except for the briefest of moments, to do otherwise risks a collision. My next visit will definitely be with Mikes Tours, but next time I'll opt for the countryside."

He was very knowledgable about the city and its history, and we seemed to hit all the highlights in three hours. Amsterdam is a very bike-friendly city but it was really busy the weekend we were there. Pete told us proper etiquette and instructions for riding around. A few in our group weren't listening or didn't follow his guidance and therefore would fall behind, brake before going up a hill, just stop in the middle of traffic which was really annoying. Overall it was a great tour but as with any group, a few can ruin it so listen to the guide and use common sense. They offer student discounts with ID and at the end of the tour we were given a coupon for half off bike rentals, valid at any time. They don't take reservations, just show up before the tour. Highly recommend, you don't need to be in amazing shape to keep up. It's mostly flat except going over the bridges which aren't very steep and fairly short. They hav ponchos available to bring with you in case of rain."

In 10 minutes we left the bustle behind and were enjoying the countryside. Both in our fifties, and faced with Amsterdam's incredible cycling culture, the tour was an ideal way to experience a little of Dam's cycling. It wasn't too hard, but without the tour we would have been reluctant to jump on a bike.

The three hour escorted ride, was great fun from start to finish. A quick talk on the history of Amsterdam, then a group of about twelve of us set off on a tour of the city, on our bikes. Mike, our funky and friendly guide, was an absolute star. I think we were all a little bit captivated by her, as she led us through the city, taking us to all the areas of interest. Her commentary was very witty, and she regaled us with tales of Amsterdam. We were also taken into the Vondelpark and other quieter areas away from the more usual tourist haunts. When the weather deteriorated, Mike took us to a quiet pub, for a few drinks to shelter from the rain. This was a great tour, which I didn't want to end. Will definately go on further tours with this company in the future."

The pace was perfect for us. At each stop he shared interesting history or background of the site/location. We stopped at a farm and sampled cheese while hearing how it's made.

There were frequent stops to describe the sights and we cycled mainly on quieter streets and cycleways. Pete was careful to keep the group together at all times and waited to make sure everyone got through the busy intersections. We walked our bikes through a couple of pedestrian only areas (the red light district) and stopped for a beer at a lovely little pub with a beer garden. When we checked a map afterwards we realised there was no way we could have covered the distance by foot in the five hours we were there. It was a great way to orientate yourself to this lovely but geographically confusing city. We only had one day in Amsterdam but we had such a positive experience we will visit again.

He was funny, easy-going, and knowledgeble about Amsterdam and its culture and customs. I think if George Carlin had a son, Karl could've been him! He expertly guided us through the busy streets (and it was Sunday, when traffic wasn't so bad!), stopping at points to show or explain something. We got a quick overview of how Amsterdam was formed prior to starting the tour. We were able to stop for a quick snack--13 year olds can't go too long without eating--and stopped for a beer at a brewery. The whole group seemed to enjoy themselves. Karl was good about keeping some topics at PG-13. I'd go wtih Mike's Bikes Tours again, given the chance."

My group had probably the most fun-loving guide ever in Ashley, a cheeky guy from South Africa, who provided a lot of laughs all along the way. And he was wearing cloggs all the time while cycling!We explored parts of the city and then the countryside to the south-east, where we stopped at a windmill, and then also went to a farm where cheese was produced, and cloggs were made. The people working on that farm were absolutely bonkers, but in a good way :) At the end of our visit we stocked up on some fresh cheese.I would definitely go on this tour again, as it was good fun, and Amsterdam simply screams at you to get on a bike."

The people from Mike's Bike Tours are friendly and funny, and our guide was just great, he was knowledgable and made us laugh a lot. The people who run this pace are young and free spirited (read: a tad alternative), so not a place if you are a bit stuck up or require to be treated like royalty. That said, we found everyone was very pleasant and customer friendly.The tour starts at the bike shop. You get a safety briefing and a short history lesson of Amsterdam and surroundings, and after that they provide everyone with a bike (nice ones too!). They have bikes for every size and they are very easy to ride.The tour itself is great fun, you visit a cheese factory and a wind mill, and you get more than a glimpse of the beautiful Dutch countryside. The pace is quite relaxed, you stop at all major crossings and the guides do all they can to make sure no one gets lost, or worse.The tour was fun and relaxed, and we really recommend you give these guys a try when you're in Amsterdam!

My family consists of my wife and 4 year old son. After reaching Amsterdam we had a telephonic conversation with Mike and were informed that the trip for the country tour starts at 11 in the morning. Around 10:30 we called our guy to understand where his shop is as no tram or bus go there. Moreover a suggested 10 minute walk seemed much longer for us. By the time we reached there ( after 20 mins of fast walking) I realised that the briefing already started. So wanted to talk to Mike again but instead had to deal with few people ( almost thugs and no manners at all). These guys do not know how to deal with customers and probably have no formal education at all as it appears from their behaviour. After a rough 5 minutes discussion I realised that this is not a place for families at all and made my mind about an alternative. The same evening I got in touch with another travel agent. The duration of this country side tour is 6 hours instead of 3 hours that Mike is providing and we had plenty of time in Volendam, Marken and Windmills. Ultimately I felt that it was actually good that we missed Mikes trip and could find for another option which is much better and safer for families."

It started to pour with rain just after we set off but Stuart's lovely, happy and encouraging personality kept everyone in good spirits. The farm was a little too commercial for my taste and I was hoping to really see how they made the cheese rather than an empty demo, but the crazy farmer was very entertaining as he demonstrated his clog making which was great. Stuart suggested we take some sandwiches with us to eat at the farm which was lovely...you can buy them at the Italian deli next door to the shop before you leave too. The following day we did the city tour with Stuart too, the kids loved that as well, and Stuart gave us lots of local knowledge about the better museums and galleries to visit. I really liked the personal touches and kindness that these boys show to their clients. I must say without their tours and local knowledge we wouldn't have enjoyed Amaterdam as much as we did. I feel like I really have a good understanding of the history and how it has shaped modern day Amsterdam, socially, physically and politically. What more could I want?As far as the helmets go, well I loved not having to wear one but I was a little concerned with the kids not wearing one on the busy roads, and my son did take a fall on the country tour (completely his fault). If I could offer one area of improvement...it would be to offer helmets as an option... Australians are hard wired about helmet safety and have been indroctinated about the horrific consequences of head trauma....However anyone of us taking this tour who grew up in the 70's did manage to make it to Amsterdam in 2012 after a childhood of no helmets on both bikes and skateboards ; ) and sometimes I do just love riding with the wind in my hair!"

We had a great group of people from six different countries, ranging in age from 17 to mid-60s. (Three of them had been out with Mike's Bikes on the City Tour the day before, and they liked it so much they booked the Country Tour. That said a lot.) Our guide was 'Mrs. Mike', their woman guide. She gave us the perfect mix of information and humour and was a fantastic guide.The bikes were very easy to ride. I ride a lot at home and Mike's Bikes are similar to mine--safe for all ages and levels. (Nothing fancy-schmancy like racing bikes.) We had no small kids in our group, but I'd say any child who was a confident rider and aged 9 or 10 would be fine. 22 kms sounds like a lot, but it is virtually flat the whole way and you go at a leisurely pace. I'm no athlete but I found it fine, as did all the other people in our tour. Mike did a great job of keeping tabs on her flock and making sure we all kept up.The ride was very picturesque. Although it was billed as a Country Tour, we got info. and photo ops. at many points along the route and I felt we had a very full tour. Some tour guides I've seen barely stop for photos but Mike was good about juggling half a dozen cameras. The cheese and clog farm was entertaining. The farmer had the gift of the gab and had everyone laughing. Make no mistake--this is a tourist farm, but that's what you came for! The farm-fresh cheese was delicious. Mike stopped at a bakery on the way for those of us who wanted to pick up bread, and we had a simple but wonderful lunch outside in the sun. (Beer and other drinks can be purchased at the farm, but no food other than cheese.) Clogs of all shapes and sized are available and it was interesting to hear about the various uses for this typical Dutch shoe. (My one tip is not to purchase the colorful wooden tulips at the farm. They look lovely and I thought they were exclusive to the farm. However, I found very similar but cheaper ones in several gift shops in the city.)Probably the highlight was the gorgeous scenery and being part of such a fun group of people. Our tour ran a bit late, but Mike confirmed that nobody had to be back in a hurry. The weather started off with a little rain but we all got ponchos. By noon, the sun was out and it ended up being perfect weather for a bike ride. We rode back at a leisurely pace through some gorgeous parks. Really great value for money.I'd certainly go again and so would my son. Thanks, Mike's Bikes!"

Visit to a traditional dairy farm which consisted of a smelly, flithy cow barn (very unhygienic) with an explanation of how cheese is made by hand, and a cheese tasting. Would never pass any Health & Safety regulations! You could buy cheese but only in big blocks, and there was no other food, only a coin-operated fridge for cold drinks. Our Tour Guide had brought bread along for those who bought cheese, but it would have been nice to be able to buy fresh bread rolls /snacks/coffee and have a light meal. The only place to sit was next to the smelly cow barn. Also at cheese farm was a traditional clog-making display (about 10 minutes), which was also disappointing. We cycled for 5 hours (with stops where guide talked) without a proper meal break! Luckily I took biscuits with, othewise we'd be fainting of hunger!"

It had pretty much everything you'd want out of a bike tour - the staff were friendly and down-to-earth, with lots of local knowledge and we saw all the main sights that the city has to offer. Our tour guide, Ashley, was great because he was a really nice guy and had lots of interesting stuff to tell us about each place we went. As for the cycling itself, we were a bit apprehensive about the busy roads beforehand but our tour guide knew what he was doing and was able to make the cycle feel easy and safe. It's about 3 hours in total but the time really flies. Overall an awesome tour which we would definitely recommend."

This was already on my try to do list, and when we met a group of 20-somethings from Australia in London who had just come from Amsterdam (and we were headed there) said \"Be sure you take th Mike's Bikes Countryside tour\", it was a must do! Our group consisted of my 2 daughters (13 and 17), my husband and I. We took the 11 a.m. Bike Tour of the Countryside. Even with sketchy weather (they provide rain gear just in case, but we didn't need),we had a great time. Everything is so flat that riding for around 4 hours was no problem - plus there are stops along the way. Our tourguide (Stuart) was very interested in what he was telling us about - and not too hard to look at either (which is helpful when you have teen girls in tow)! You need to be fairly comfortable with riding a bike - gotta go when the traffic breaks, gotta keep up. I wouldn't do this with a child under 12 - no matter what their bike skills. Although,I think they may have had some bikes with trailer or baby seats for those with little kids, maybe even a tandem bike. We wish we had time to do their other tour, the city tour, but with other tickets we had purchased, not time. We had so much fun, we put Mikes' Bikes tour as part of our must do list for our 1 day in Munich later in the week - which we also thoroughly enjoyed and will post on separately!"

Having done lots of research we decided on hiring bikes and doing a tour with Mike.He offered half price bike rental if you go on a tour. We sorted it our by email beforehand. The manager Bente was very responsive. The 2 of us went on the Countryside tour and also hired bikes for 4 days(Pretty much the whole of the time we were in Amsterdam), Great value at 76\u20ac all- in including insurance.Hiring bikes is a great choice, you can get around all of Amsterdam so easily on the bike using the dedicated tracks/sections of roads. It's incredibly busy and at first you feel like your life is at peril! - but you soon get the hang of it. The culture seems to be that cars treat bikers with respect. we were that any accident involving a car and a bike is generally seen as the cars fault( we didn't see any incidents in the 5 days we were there). It's a great experience and you see so much more than by walking.Mikes Tour was great to do as you see more than just the city and very informative and 'miss mike' was fab guide. No hesitation in recommending Mikes Tours/Rental. Had a puncture one day, and no quibble they just changed the bike straight away, and we were off again.If you like adventure ( on a mild-ish scale) you should do this."

Of the 11, there were four children (aged 10 to 15) and he kept the humour appropriate. He really made the tour fun - although I'm sure every guide would be awesome. I highly recommend this tour (and this company in general) it's something (and somewhere) you'd never go by yourself.

The cheese farm tour was a strange but fun experience with the crazy farmer. This turned out to be the best thing my friends and I did on our holiday to Amsterdam and it was extremely good value too! I would definitely recommend Mike's bike tours if you are going to Amsterdam, they also rent out bikes ( at a discounted rate if you take the tour first)."

The red flag for me should have been its strong recommendation by Lonely Planet, because, after all, if Lonely Planet likes something, than you almost always know it's going to be shallow and juvenile. But I still wasn't prepared for Mike's Tour. Our guide--I'm not sure he ever gave his name, but that's probably to his advantage--was friendly enough, but unless you came to Amsterdam for weed and nothing else, he had very little insight to offer on Amsterdam. Everything was about smoking--kinda sad. But the biggest problem was his refusal to cap the number of tour participants. I was about the 15th person when I got there, but more kept coming, and coming, and coming. Our guide said he was going to split into two groups with separate guides, but he never did--and we ended up with 32 people on our tour through some of Amsterdam's busiest streets! It was bedlam. He is very lucky there were no injuries. He also didn't weed out the good bicyclists from the bad by testing everyone. We had two young ladies who practically didn't know how to ride bikes: they could generally stay on but had no sense about rules of the road, and they would do dangerous things like stop in the middle of a lane, or cross on the inside of a parked car, wedged between the car and the curb. Mind-boggling. The only thing that redeems this tour was that our guide, realizing he had invited a few too many, gave us a discount off the cost. But I still couldn't recommend this tour to anyone. Even if you're a stoner, find a tour with more content and then visit the coffeeshops on your own time!"

We are so happy that we found Mike's. Mike's is not easy to find as it is on a side street, Kerkstraat (we more or less stumbled upon the place), but finding the shop is worth the effort. First, the person we dealt with was friendly and helpful. Next, the bikes are not as conspicuous as the bikes are from more tourist-familiar places such as Yellow Bike. Finally, the price was reasonable. We insured our bikes for the 3 hours we used them and the total cost was 10 euros per bike. If you are looking for a good place to rent bikes, try Mike's."

We'd seen online videos of the tour & thought we'd like to give it a go even though we're both approaching retirement age. At first my wife was a liittle anxious, having never cycled in a city before. She needn't have worried. Pete, our guide was fantastic. After a short briefing we headed out into the Dutch countryside getting up a fair speed. Pete would constantly look back to check that everyone in the group was ok. The countryside was beautiful & the cycling easy. We had a few information stops along the way & the opportunity for a few photos. We especially enjoyed cycling through the wood on the way back. Good clean air & a great sense of freedom. I would certainly recommend this tour as a must for able-bodied people of all ages. Thanks again Pete !"

I took the 'countryside tour' with them today after spending 2 days exploring the city myself. And what a great way to end my weekend. First of all, you're on bikes. New, shiny, comfy bikes. Then you get a great insight into the country - the architecture, the crazy water ways, and a potted history, Then you get gorgeous cycling along canal side routes I doubt you'd find yourself if you just rented a bike (which of course you can do through Mike's Bikes.)No doubt it helped that today was a lovely sunny day. And that our guide, Ashley, was cool, calm, funny, chilled and informative. And that we saw cheese being made and clogs being carved. Windmills at work. Hares running in the fields. If you want to see a slightly different side to Amsterdam, I couldn't recommend this highly enough. Wheely."

Visited the clog/cheese shop, the mustard flavored cheese was yummy! The ride was easy, and I got to understand why everyone in A'dam rides their bikes--you get there faster, see so much more in the same time, and it's fun. Biking through Vondelpark was cool, as well. The tour is a little light on actual history, so if youre looking for a 'history of A'dam' tour, this wont be for you. However, if you want a chance to stretch your legs and see a wide swatch of the area outside the main squares, go for it!"

Maybe a little touristy at this point, but after all, we were tourists and it was fun. We had such a good time we rented bikes from Mikes for the rest of our stay in Amsterdam. I would highly recommend doing this. The first couple of hours were a little intimidating but the freedom of having a bike in Amsterdam was incredible. We got to all the major sites very easily and our boys ages 12 and 14 had a ball. We wouldn't do Amsterdam again without touring with Mike's and renting their bikes again. Awesome!"

The group was large - 30 people - so, they split us into two groups. I was a little unsure about riding on city streets, but after one busy intersection, we followed the Amstel River. The ride was beautiful following the river, then through Amsterdam Bos, Amstelvein, and a stop at a cafe on the sight of the 1928 Olympic rowing venue. Ashley, our guide was always concerned about our safety. Returning through Vondel Park was an easy ride. I would recommend, even if you are mature - (over 70)."

I unfortunately didn\u2019t have such luck. We biked into the country, which was lovely. However the \u201cfarm\u201d that we biked to was essentially just an attraction. The \u201cfarm\u201d had tour groups constantly rolling in and it had a gift shop which made me realize it was an easy tourist stop. Also, one of the girls in my group could barely bike and would get off and walk her bike most the time (despite how easy the bike path was). This slowed the entire group down and added an extra hour to our tour. Lastly, while my tour guide was very kind and funny, he also took the time to teach the group how to smoke marijuana out of his own personal vaporizer that he had on him. While I didn\u2019t care if he was smoking on our trip, I did care that this slowed down our tour even more and since he was now high, he made more stops than usual to point out various things that only a high person would find important. If you have an extra day with nothing to do, then take this bike tour. If you do not have time to waste, then definitely pass."

The ride was great - the only difficult parts are where you cross a canal. One other warning - since the tour rides in a single file to allow the faster Amsterdam natives to pass our slower bikes, there are some instances where the group can be split up crossing a street when the traffic light turns. I've also seen some people in our group crossing on a red to keep up. It will be good for the guides to stress how to handle that situation to the group ahead of time."

On the way you'll hit a dairy farm, huge windmill and a wooden clog maker. All very cool. Quick tip, bring a backpack for the cheese, you'll want to buy. Weeks later we're still eating it. Also, cash only, no cards for cheese and clogs. Overall, i would definitely recommend Mike's Bike Tour. Karl made it especially awesome."

In total, you bike about 22 km through the city and then into the countryside and then back through the city, all in about 3.5 hours. The tour was not difficult or strenuous and I saw that some older couples (mid to late 50s) didn't have a problem with the distance at all, mainly due to the Netherlands being flat. The cheese and clog farm was amazing, probably the best thing on the tour. Claude did well pointing out different things as we biked along, and kept a good pace throughout the tour. I plan on doing another Mike's tour when I get to Munich or other places they have them. They are well worth the price and give you a much more in-depth view of your surroundings than if you were sitting on a bus or in a canal boat. Riding is made very easy by new 'american' bikes which were enjoyable. I'd say that this was probably the highlight of my trip to amsterdam and I would def. do it again."

I was a little wobbly at first, but did ok, didn't run into anybody! it's totally flat here so no worries if you are not in shape, its a very leisure ride. We rode out to the country side, took some pictures at a Windmill, and then stopped at a farm and some tasted cheese and saw how clogs were made! Got to meet a 2 week old baby cow too! We bought some cheese here to take home as gifts and it is really yummy cheese! On the ride back we stopped at a cafe and had a beer :) We just had so much fun, and really got to see some cool stuff.

After having read all the tripadvisor reviews, I was convinced that this would be the perfect day out for our family.

Pip our tour guide was extremely knowledgable and gave us just the right amount of information about all the sights we visited. He has a great personality and really made our day special. We did the Countryside BikeTour as we had already walked around the city and wanted something different. For a family of 5, the cost was very reasonable and was real value for money. We especially liked the idea of visiting a windmill, cheese and clog factory. We saw cheese being made and got to sample lots of different types of beautiful Dutch cheese. The clog making process was very interesting, the kids watched on in amazement. Since you have the chance to buy things at the gift shop, ie. cheeses, clogs, t-shrits, mugs etc, don't forget to take some cash as none of our credit cards worked in the shops machine. Think a lot of people get caught out on this and end up not buying things!!! We were lucky and ended up borrowing money and paying it back after the bike tour. Our family had such a fantastic day, none of us wanted to get off the bikes as we didn't want it to end. Thanks so much Pip, we will remember this bike tour forever."

Cycling in the core of Amsterdam can be a little chaotic, especially in a tour group, but it was more than manageable for the novice urban cyclists in our group, and it's quite safe given the extensive cycle track network.No general topic cycle tour is going to give you enough information if you expect a PhD dissertation on politics or recent history, but this was one of the better-informed cycle tours we have gone on in a few European cities. It's enough to orient you to the city and take in a few sites that you might not have gone on, plus you're on a bike, which is very fun!"

We did the countryside tour which starts in the city, stops at a couple places and then all of a sudden you're in the beautiful Amsterdam countryside. The windmill we stopped at was pretty and we had plenty of time to take photos and stretch. The cheese and clog farm we stopped at was great. The farm owners were hilarious and the cheese (which I bought a lot of) was deliciously creamy and they give out free samples. The guide took us around to many pretty spots and I really got to see the beauty in the outskirts of the city.One of the reasons this was such a fun tour was our tour guide, Karl. He was awesome. If you get Karl you are guaranteed a good time.For those of you traveling with boys who are not so psyched about bike tours - before we went on this tour my boyfriend was less than excited to go because he thought it would be lame. He ended up loving it and even told his friends how good it was when we got home. This ended up being one of our favourite things we did in Amsterdam (Heineken Brewery and Canal Dinner Cruise were the other two - which you should also do!).If you like beer (and really, who doesn't?), I suggest offering to be the person who rides at the back and makes sure no one lags behind, because you'll get a free beer at the cheese and clog farm. My boyfriend was very happy to have volunteered :)"

Joined by a couple of Ausies and three UK-ers, our guide Pit fitted us with Townies and on we went exploring Amsterdam he nourished us with educational information about the city's history, culture, cycling manners, etc. Just like the other reviews on this site, the excursion exceeded my expectations and I recommend it wholeheartedly regardless of your level of cycling. Note: don't bother bringing along your helmet as you'll be the ONLY ONE wearing one, like I was, unless it is your personal preference."

Pete, our guide was jovial, well informed and gave us detailed briefings on the places we passed by. I loved the cheese and clog factory and this was a great treat. To those who love cheese, do buy the cheese in the factory as its really good. Another value added advantage to these tours is that one can rent the bicycles for a cheaper rate upon completing the tour. Its a good way to spend a day at Amsterdam ! My only complaint is that I wished the pace of the Bicycle tour was a bit slower! ( but that's only me, everyone else seemed to cope just fine)."

We stopped at various points along the route including a traditional windmill, and a quaint cheese and clog making factory. If you're after an easy paced tour with an experienced and friendly team, I highly recommend Mike's Bike Tours. This was my 2nd bike tour in Europe, and if you can ride a bike, skip the tour buses and join a bike tour instead."

As with most bike tour groups, Mike's is staffed by a bunch of friendly, knowledgeable and laid-back twenty-somethings. Our guide, Petra, was excellent! As a native, she had a ton of information for us, which was relayed chronologically at various stops throughout the trip. We learned a great deal about the history of Holland, and also got to see a variety of locations in and around Amsterdam including a beautiful city park, houseboats on the canals, wilderness trails, dikes, traditional and contemporary architecture and a small dairy farm, which sells it's own cheese, as well as a variety of Dutch-made souvenir items. Bring a lunch (or snack) and water, because you'll stop at this farm for a break toward the end of the ride. (This is your only bathroom stop--I highly recommend using the bathroom at Starbucks or McDonald's before the tour, as the Mike's Bike's bathrooms leave a bit to be desired.) You'll get a short tour of the cheese-making and clog-making operations there, as well as a taste of their awesome kaas (cheese). For something like a Euro, fifty, you can also have an ice-cold can of Heineken (or two), which will taste amazing because: a.) You'll be thirsty from riding, and b.) Beer always tastes better in it's native country!By the way, be sure to volunteer to \"bring up the rear\" of your tour. You'll get your beer for free! My husband did this, and he did have to ride up to let our guide know that one of our group members was way behind (and possibly lost) after she stopped to take photos, but they found her quickly and all was well.Our kids (ages 12 and 8) did well on the tour, and enjoyed themselves, despite the humidity that day. The terrain is, as it usually is in Holland, very flat, and the wind was minimal. Though the ride is not strenuous, you will probably feel tired, but content, afterward if you are not used to riding for hours at a time."

We toured all of the places that everyone else tours, I have got to say, but that is just what we expected; the windmill, the wooden shoe and cheese factory, all the places visitors to Amsterdam want to see. Loved the cold beer at our stop! Thanks! Great, informative guide. And reasonably priced.

The things I wanted to do in Amsterdam (aside from the obvious) was to ride a bike (the Dutch way), see a windmill and the countryside, and to visit a cheese and clog factory. The countryside tour with Mike's Bike Tour allowed me to do just that! I got there around 11:20am and the tour usually starts at 11:00am so I just made it to the end of the basic introduction but luckily, was allowed to join the group. The guide, Stewart (sorry if I recalled the incorrect name) was very friendly, approachable, knowledgable and experienced. He gave the group lots of information on the history of Amsterdam and travel tips throughout the tour, and even a few restaurant recommendations. I'm not an expert bike rider but never felt out of place throughout the tour - I loved every minute of it. All the staff was really friendly and helpful - one of them let me take a photo of their beloved plant when we returned our bikes! There was another bike rental/tour near the hotel where I stayed but after reading the reviews, I knew I had to go with Mike's Bike! It was truly a great way to see Amsterdam and it was a great day out. Do not miss out on this if you're in Amsterdam! It's a must do. I would do it again the next time I'm back!!!"

Then we were off on the tour with stops in Vondel park, the houseboat community, the sports park, and finally the windmill where we had a group photo taken. We then biked to the farm. The tour guides made it an interesting tour with informative tidbits about the history of the Netherlands as well as modern day things to avoid in order to survive a trip to Amsterdam. Overall, it was a fun adventure. I never really found out who Mike was and it didn't really matter. All the tour guides were a bit eccentric but interesting.

My husband and I haven't been on a bike in years, but this was a trip we were able to complete. We chose the countryside trip. Highly recommend this one. It is about 14 miles long over a four hour period. The countryside is beautiful. It was hard to believe we were so close to the city and yet felt so rural. We rode along the Amstel River for a long time and it was very peaceful. We then went to a family owned farm where they make their own Gouda cheese and wooden shoes, all of which is for sale in their little store. We then continued through some farms and lovely parks. Some people opt for the city tour; however, I felt it was somewhat dangerous in the city when we first got started and ended this trip. I felt much safer out in the country. There are many rules in the city that apply to bikes. The countryside is just quiet riding past the farms and trees. One important piece of advise, bring your own water and snacks. The ride started at 11am and doesn't end until aroun 3pm, and there are no stops for food. Also, water is a must. They sell some at the bike shop if you forget."

You get to see a lot in a little time and wherever you want to spend more time you can stop for as long as you want. So renting a bike was clearly set for us although we never thought about doing a bike tour. After discovering the city for a couple of days we wanted to see a bit more and decided to do the countryside bike tour. This was a great choice and we have had a blast. The tour first takes you through the city, along the river to the suburbs of Amsterdam. We stopped at a windmill and tasted cheese on a farm. The same family also showed us how to they make the wooden shoes. After this little break of about 45 to an hour the tour continued through the countryside around Amsterdam, again along a river with great houseboats and finally through some greats parks. We not only enjoyed the whole tour but it also gave us great ideas on what else to do in Amsterdam. If we did not had to leave the next day, we would have gone back to the big forest/park just outside Amsterdam.The best thing of the whole tour though was Petra, our guide. She is from Amsterdam and had apart from a great humour lots of stories and history to share with us. Definitely a great way to get to know an other city/country."

I had to encourage her a few times to keep up, but it really wasn't a problem and she had a great time.After spending a lot of time standing in lines and looking at things (sites, museums, etc), it was really nice to get some exercise on a beautiful day while also seeing things."

Also, you'll have the opportunity to have a lot of fun while getting to know better about the history of this almost 900 years old city. We joined the superior standard bike tour this morning and we highly recommend it. And if by chance you find out that Tonny will be your guide, don't hesitate: I'm sure you'll enjoy the experience; the guy is awesome!"

The route is flat and easy, and our tour guide, Petra took frequent breaks to fill us in on Dutch history. We start off in Amsterdam and ride through Vondel Park and into the lush green countryside along the Amstel River. We stopped by a cheese making farm and a Dutch wooden shoe factory. The cheese samples are delicious and fresh and watching them make the shoes was fun. Shoppers are welcome to pick-up some cheese, shoes and other Dutch treats! After a nice break, we hopped on our bikes to enjoy the scenic, quiet countryside. It's a nice break from the city streets and a great way to enjoy the afternoon. TIP: Bring a bag lunch/snack and water."

It was an easy ride since the city is flat - the only hills are the bridges.. about 2 feet high! Our tour guide was excellent, giving us a Master class about history, geography, sociology, architecture & useful tips of this beautiful & unique city. The bikes are pretty easy & friendly since they are regular street bikes so anyone can ride them, and for 18 Euros you get 3 full hours of exciting sightseeing and fun - just watch on the intersections because some bikers are a bit agressive."

To ease us into biking in traffic, we opted for Mike's countryside tour. It was perfect! We were lucky enough to hit a day with lots of riders and two other families so they put us in a group with just the families. Stewart was our guide and a good match for our kids. They all wanted to ride near him and he was wonderful about answering their questions and keeping an eye on them. The ride had enough stops that no one got winded, although the wind made it a bit challenging. Kids enjoyed city history, cheese tasting, and shoe demonstration, but some kittens on the farm were the hit. Highly recommend this for families. We now feel ready to try some solo biking, and we are very educated on city history."

You'll see Amsterdam from a different view compared to walking in the centre along the channels. You'll ride about 20km in 4 hrs therefore you do not have to worry, especially since it's a flat land. You'll go through town, see the old wind mill, farm where cheese or clogs are done. BTW, cheese is great and you get it here cheaper compared to the same cheese sold in the downtown. Worth to buy it there. You'll have some more short stops, which are enriched by a great guide (Stuart looks to know more than locals :-)At the end, if you survive, you have to pay. The good thing is you get a discount for another tour or for bike rental. We've used next day ..."

We are 2 adults (expert cyclists, road and mountain) and an 11-year-old strong boy, and a 14-year-old tentative girl. She's not a great cyclist. Man, if you're looking for a fun afternoon, and letting your testosterone chill, you're in for a great time. They do not take reservations. Show up at 11 am (not earlier), and they'll lead you across the street to a kind of warehouse where you'll hear a half-hour (maybe more) history talk about Amsterdam. Even if you know your history, it's fun and well done. We just sat on the floor and took it in. There were about 30 of us who showed up that day so after the talk we split into 2 groups (one with families; one not) and they set us up with bikes. This happened pretty quickly considering there were 30 people. The bikes were in good shape. They're 5-speed bikes, cruiser style bikes with front brakes (I learned that the brakes are on opposite handlebars in Europe, ie front wheels are controlled by the right hand...I digress) with adjustable seats. They also have a front saddle bag and rear paniers available so if your bike doesn't come with any, just ask. We carried our water bottles in them and the CLOGS my husband bought along the way. Seriously.We headed off around noon. Some people had forgotten how to ride bikes, but everything was pretty relaxed and everyone \"got it\". We meandered through the streets near the bike shop for around 15 minutes working our way out of the city. It's all flat except for the 1-minute bursts over canal bridges. This was my least favourite part as I worried about cars, street crossings, etc, but we did it. I should add that there were some younger kids too (age 7-8) and everyone managed just fine. Shortly we arrived along the banks of the Amstel River which was just gorgeous and we were truly in a rural area. This was on a rec path so we could let our guard down. Our first stop was by a windmill and that was a great photo op. Next stop: a clog factory and cheese factory farm....and gift shop! Ok, this is where it felt a bit tacky, but hey, we went along with it and the guy who spoke about his clog shop (demo-ed clog making) and talked about his cheese was fun and it was enjoyable. We were totally drawn in and bought a pile of souvenirs and cheese. The cheese was awesome and lasted for 2-weeks through the Italy leg of our trip! We learned that the airport prices for these same souvenirs like cheese graters was about 2/3 the price, but what the heck. This would have been a great place to have a picnic but they didn't sell other food besides cheese there. Tip: bring something like fruit, granola bar or a sandwich. We got really hungry but hung in there. The cycling continued along farm fields, onto rec paths, along an area where people live in houseboats, and finally through Vondel Park (like Central Park) and back onto the city streets. It was totally exhilarating and a feast for the eyes. Our bike guide was terrific and made sure the group stayed together. It was a very friendly atmosphere with like-minded travellers. We did so many cool things this trip (including hiking in Cinque Terre) but this was our total highlight."

On the tour though he was more that happy to take pictures of groups and in general make good attempts to get to know everyone and was approachable about advice on anything else Amsterdam related (where to go for food, nightlife, etc...) On the tour you head out of the city and (the main highlights) stop by an old-school windmill, a cheese and clog factory where you get samples and a really interesting demonstration of clog making. You go through some really nice parks and end up back in the city after about 4 hours! Definitely worth it if you're interested in getting out of the city for a bit!"

Not only will you get a mini history lesson about Amsterdam's past, but you'll get a thorough tour of the city which will help you easily navigate during the rest of your stay. This is the perfect thing to do on your first day in town.My tour group consisted of myself, my girlfriend and one other person along with our guide, Stuart. We were surprised we still went on the tour with only 3 paying customers, but that made the experience even better. Stuart proved himself to be extremely knowledgeable about all things Amsterdam (history, culture, language, etc.).We hit a lot of the tourist spots as well as some lesser-known places. The highlight of the trip was our visit to a micro brewery called Brouwerij 't IJ, part of which is set into a windmill.The cost of the tour is 18 Euro and it was well worth the price."

I kind of felt like the locals on the bike and seeing the country, the windmill, the cheesefarm was a great experience. of course we bought a couple of cheese and also saw how the wooden clogs are made.

We visited Amsterdam for a weekend and decided that a guided bike tour would be a great way to experience the city like the locals do. As the city is so easy to get around on foot, we opted for the countryside tour and ended up having a fantastic afternoon out!The tour started off with Stuart, our guide, giving a brief but very interesting introduction to Dutch history and the origins of the city itself. Then we got a run down of bike basics and were sized up for a bike that fit (they cater for everyone!).The bikes themselves are a pretty simple city bike style and give a great, comfortable ride. They're all well maintained too and nobody had any problems in a group of 20, although the guide did have everything needed should anything have happened en route.Then the fun began! The tour starts off on some pretty quiet streets to get everyone used to their bikes, then it's off towards the outskirts and into the big beyond, with a few stops along the way to explain the local architecture and city design. It's not long before you're into open space and green fields along the Amsteldijk, making for a really pleasant cycle. From here on there's a stop off at a dairy farm to learn about cheese and clog production, a look at how the land is managed and then along some beautiful cycle tracks back into the centre via some of the city's main green areas. Stuart was incredibly knowledgeable and informative, but kept a good balance between cycling and info stops.All in all, this was an awesome way to spend a few hours getting away from the hectic city centre to see some of the Dutch countryside."

The tour guide Stuart was brilliant. He knew everything about the city and made it funny and interesting. The tour was the best value for money activity we did. It lasted for four hours and we got to stop half way for a drink in an authentic Dutch pub. We really enjoyed it and it gave us the confidence to rent bikes the next day; we also got this at a discounted price because we had done the tour. All the staff that work in the shop are friendly and really helpful. They were there to answer all our questions and help us plan other activities we wanted to do. This is a great service and we would recommend it to anyone who visits the city. It's definitely suitable for everyone-you don't have to be a good cyclist. It's a must do!"

The City tour is great for orientating yourself in the city itself and see some of the sites. On the otherhand the countyside tour is a great chance to explore the surrounding countryside, canals, cheese and clog factories. Personally, I preferred the Countryside Tour but to be honest but are fantastic. Our guide was excellent and was also full of recommendations about restaurants and other sites in the city. I have taken similar tours in Paris and also plan a return visit this summer. I cannot recommend this highly enough. If you are brave enough you can also rent bikes from them at a discounted rate after you complete your tour and they give you a handy discount card for future tours with themselves or in Munich. Never fear if you dont think you are the fittest or not the best on a bike - Amsterdam is very flat and makes for an easy going way to spend the day.."

The first thing I wanted to do was exploring the city by bike to view the highlights and to see what I should visit during my stay. Unfortunaltely, I was there alone on Monday, so the City Trip was cancelled :( They said it was only the third time this year that this happened. I went back Tuesday, and then there were enough others (I think we were 5 in total, plus the guide Petra). Unfortunately, the weather was not so good, and from time to time there were some raindrops.Before the start, we got a (not so brief) overview of the history of Amsterdam. We were told that Amsterdam did not grow spontaneously, but that the city layout was carefully planned, with all the canals and streets. It doesn't look like that to me: all these roads and waterways look so similar that it was like a labyrinth to me.But that was no problem for our guide that lead us to all the important buildings and places in town, accompanied with fun and entertaining explanations along the trip.One setback however: I wanted to keep a bike for the rest of my stay, so I needed to rent a different bike than the bikes that were used for the guided tour. The rental bikes come with a back pedal brake (like most Dutch bikes), instead of regular cantilever brakes. I find this strange, because the city is so busy with pedestrians and other bikes, that prompt reacting is sometimes needed, and that is easier with regular brakes. But that was not my main problem. The problem that got me fed up most, was that in 2 days time, the chain fell off at least 20 times! Of course this only happened after the guided tour, and after the shop was closed so I couldn't go back to get it repaired.But after all: a guided bike tour is really something one must do when visiting Amsterdam!"

I enjoy bikes tours as they provide a great way to see cities at a quicker pace than walking, but slower than a automobile tour. Mike's bike tour seemed to be the best bike tour for me in Amsterdam as I already had a bike and they give you 5 euros off the price if you bring your own bike. Most other sites I looked at did not give you that option. So my price was 13 Euro for the 2.5 hour city tour. At the start of the tour our guide gave us a run down of the city history and a how to bike in town lesson. Our actual time on the bikes in the city was about 2 hours. During this tour we stopped about 8 times to listen to our guide and ask questions. This was the only part I wish was a little better. I would have preferred more stopping with more information. When we did stop our guide was very knowledgeable. He was able to answer any questions we posed to him. At one time though we biked past the house where Anne Frank and her family hid, without stopping and without any word on it. I pointed it out the the people around me, thinking it was odd we didn't stop at what I would consider a very important place in town. Once back at the garage our guide gave us all resuturant recommendations and directtions to get home. The experice was a good one, I only wished things to be a little more informative. But for the price you couldn't beat Mike's. I plan on trying their country tour next time I am in town.To sum up: good value, knowledge guides, cover a lot of the city in short time, could have been a little more informative."

My guide, Pete, was VERY knowledgeable, really fun (he wore wooden shoes with tiger stripes painted on them!), and seemed genuinely interested in our group's wellbeing and enjoyment. I was nervous at first about the ride, as I'm not a regular bike rider, but the bikes were of high quality (cruisers with gears... mine was named Red Light Riley) and the ride was flat and smooth. I bought some authentic wooden shoes and fresh gouda on the ride. :) I would definitely recommend taking snacks and/or lunch, as there wasn't an official lunch stop (nor really anywhere to buy food, with the exception of the gouda). However, you could buy water at Mike's before departing. Next time I'm in Amsterdam, I'll try out their other tour or rent a bike from Mike's and venture out on my own. Highly recommended!!!!"

I did the countryside tour, which starts at 11 AM, and goes on about a 23 kilometer trip through the countryside. You stop at a windmill, and also a cheese factory, and get to see wooden clogs being made. It was fun sampling the cheese. Our tour guide was great, he gave us a lot of history about Amsterdam. I didn't know that Amsterdam is like 30 feet below sea level, and the city uses a series of pumps to keep the water level at a consistent level - and the city never floods because of all of these pumps. There are photo stops at the windmill and at other spots along the way. I actually just had my camera out the whole time in my hand, and took pictures with one hand while riding the bike with the other, maybe not advised to do this unless you are on a flat road without other people around you. I'm in pretty good shape - the bike tour is definitely not completely easy, so if you are in really bad shape you might have a tough ride. Make sure if you are going over a canal bridge to ship to an easier gear, or you may not make it over the bridge. Also, watch out for crossing the street in the city, we had to cross the street without the guide a lot of the time. I would recommend doing the countryside tour instead of the city tour, because it is so nice to get out of the city and see the Amsterdam countryside away from more people. One other huge perk of Mike's bikes - if you go on one of their tours, you can rent a bike for really cheap the next day. I rented a bike the next day for 5 euro I think, and rode into the countryside again for another 25 kilometers or so, it was an awesome day."

For the most part Petra knows here stuff (except in one instance where she said Nazis had Jewish prisoners help dig a rowing park--actually it was built before Nazi occupation).

We really enjoyed escaping all the busy streets of Amsterdam for one afternoon to see the land and people surrounding it. The ride is not at all strenous or tiring, the only uphills are small bridges that go over the canals! The cheese and clog factory are a nice rest, but a little over-touristic and cliche for my taste. My favorite part was the final stop in Vondelpark. Pete, our guide, was very friendly and knowledgable, and he proved that he can fix a flat tire in under 4 minutes!

It was great to ride the streets of Amsterdam and then get out to the surrounding countryside.Our guide, Pete, was absolutely amazing, and knew all the little details about Holland. I highly recommend this tour. And to make things even more interesting, after taking one of their tour, you get a 50% discount on a bike rental."

I took the Munich tour and loved it...it was awesome. I enjoyed the Ansterdam version, but there were less stops, less narrative by the guide, and it seemed more of a bike ride than a tour. The Munich one felt like a tour, and was filled w/ really interesting information. I really enjoyed the Amsterdam Bike Tour, and had I not taken the Munich one before, I would probably rate this even higher. Perhaps there is less to see in Amsterdam than in Munich, or maybe the city tour (I took the country tour) is more fact filled. It was a lot of biking, which is fine, but some on the tour felt it was a little much (too long/strenuous).Overall very good, and a good way to see Amsterdam."

The tour guide was filled with knowledge about Amsterdam and had a funny way of telling it. We were taken all over Amsterdam and even into the countryside to see a windmill and a dairy farm that makes cheese as well as wooden shoes! It is the best way to acclimate yourself to the city and see parts of the Netherlands that you wouldn't have seen otherwise!The only few things that I would say is, you need to be in fairly good shape to do this tour. If you haven't exercised in 5-to 10 years, you may find it not as enjoyable and/or you will hold the rest of the group back. Keep in mind that you will cover (I can't quite remember the distance now) I believe 10-12 miles on a bike. Also, BE AWARE OF THE BIKES!!!! :) Amsterdamers ride bikes. I am convinced that the people walking were all tourists! Just be prepared that when you leave Mike's Bike garage that you will need to be comfortable enough on a bike in order to dodge bikes, cars, people and trams. Once you get out of the city it isn't so bad. I loved this bike tour so much that I planned one in Brussels and in Paris. WORTH IT!!! I can't wait to take more bike tours! I will probably never walk through my vacations again! Thanks, Mike's Bikes!!!"

I think it's less about doing a canned tourist tour than it is about experiencing the city as a local on a bike. We passed by all of the famous places in the city and even some places I hadn't heard about in all the tourist books. This bike trip really picked up my spirit and saved me from the routine of walking to museums and trying discover things on my own. A great time."

Our guide Peter was very knowledgeable about the history of this fantastic city, giving a clear and entertaining potted version before the tour actually starts. The bikes are very confortable and even someone like me, a very occasional rider, did not find the tour at all challenging. You do have to keep your eyes out and ears peeled for cars, trams, buses, pedestrians and especially other cyclists. However, doing this tour gives you a glimpse of what it might actually be like to belong to the Amsterdam cycling community.Each section of the tour only involves cycling for ten minutes at the most, and you know that Amsterdam is flat, so no problems with fatigue. There is plenty of time to take in the sights and sounds of each district. Peter gave us loads of information on the history of various areas, and the best things to see. Because of his tips we went to the top floor cafe of the new Library building near the station. He said that we would 'have the best views of the city', and he was right! We also visited the marvellous Horticultural Gardens, a marvellous tranquil space that would be enjoyable for non-gardeners too.Just telephone the office and they will tell you when the next tour is leaving, no booking required. I would highly recommend this to anyone."

Our tour guide for the countryside tour was irritating and kept laughing hysterically at her own awful jokes. Her gags were so bad I was embarrassed for her. She made very off-colour comments that made everyone uncomfortable. I know its Amsterdam and 'anything goes' but she crossed the line on several occasions. I guess its the luck of the draw. The scenery is beautiful and the cheese factory was cool so if you get a good guide you'll have a great time."

It was, without a doubt, the best sightseeing we did in the city! I was a little nervous about riding through the streets of Amsterdam during rush hour on a Friday, but it was easier than expected - as long as you watch where you are going. Stuart introduced us to the basic history of the city and its culture. It was very laid back, fun, and informational - not like a guided museum tour. He also gave the group some fantastic recommendations for food and other activities throughout the city. We took his advice on everything except the St. Nicholas boat rides...only because we ran out of time. We loved the tour so much, the fat tire tour (affiliated with Mike's) in Berlin a few days later!"

We had a little bit of trouble finding Mike's outpost within the city, but eventually we got there and we are so glad we did.Admittingly, we had some doubts about our abilities on the bikes through the city, but made it through with no problems. I even felt like a local, even though I'm sure I looked nothing of the sort. After a brief ride through town, we made it to a relaxing road with little traffic where my wife and I could ride two abreast. We took in the scenery and enjoyed our guide's talks at various stops.I loved the cheese farm where we got to try some fresh cheese, see how it is made and also witness the creation of a clog from block to foot. The farmer is great and made the tour very enjoyable. We even got to stop for a refreshing Heineken half-way through...Our ride back through the main park (Vondel...something or other) was fabulous and when we finally got back, I didn't want to get off. The guide gave some background on the future of the city's leniencies which was very informative. All in all, the best experience that you could do in Amsterdam."

I've done bike tours in other European cities and this was pretty standard fare -- an ex-pat American extols the great parts of the city while dissing the US. No surprises here -- had Mike who told lots of stories about his love of the cafes (and his displeasure with US policy on weed) and his preferred choice of prostitutes. I could have done without all that. But still love the tour and highly recommend it to everyone."

What a great time we had! Before we left, I was a little apprehensive because our 7 year-old hasn't yet learned to ride a bike. But Mike's Bikes referred us to MacBike for a bike rental in this case. There, we rented a bike with a large basket in front for our son to sit in. My husband drove him around (it was a little unwieldy, but it worked!). We started out going through the city for just a short while. Our tour guide was great--informative and humorous. We chose the countryside bike tour because I wanted a longer ride and really didn't care for a detailed drive-through and description of the red light district with my sons. I am so glad we went this route. Apparently, it's a 12 mile round trip, but it didn't feel long. My 8 year-old did great and we really enjoyed cycling out in the countryside where it was open and stress-free. The trip lasted about 3 1/2 hours with stops at a windmill and cheese and clog factory. Very neat!Definitely bring a camera. We brought our Flip camcorder and my 7 year-old had fun making some videos while riding in the basket. I would do this tour again in a heartbeat!"

We arrived breathless and late without reservations and with our 9 and 11 year old daughters. We knew our kids could handle the ride, we are fairly active, but not ultra sporty. 11 year old is a year round swimmer, 9 year old plays tennis once a week and summer swimmer. Dad is a runner and mom aspires to get more exercise, never broke a sweat. The 11 year old's only complaint was that Stuart went too slow! Even with Amsterdam's liberal views on marajuana and prostitution, any references sailed right over the heads of the children. We were in a group of about 12 or so, and except for one part were we were cycling into the wind, we stayed in the front of the pack to keep up with our kids. The few stops were welcome but did not drag on. The kids really thought the farm was the highlight, free cheese, and then some purchased for later. Ask the 9 year old, who by the way , rang her bike bell constantly, her favorite memory, she loved that Stuart ( our guide) told us about the newborn calf in the barn. She spent much of her farm visit watching and petting the newborn.Nice history and references without over doing. Stuart had to talk fast a few times due to very dark and ominous clouds... During the last serious weather burst,Stuart had us dash under a bridge for cover from the rain and sleet! Then the skies cleared and we lingered back to Mike's Bikes!They never even asked our names when we showed up, then payed at the very end. A full 4 hours, not all of it cycling. Thanks!

It's very reasonably priced too at 22 euros per person (remember to take cash as they do not accept credit cards). The tour is not at all strenuous and most of it is on quiet cycle paths and countryside roads which are all very flat! You get to see a traditional Dutch windmill and visit a cheese farm which also makes clogs. There is also the opportunity to sample and buy some cheese/clogs/souvineers and more!The highlight of the tour has to be the tour guide who was quite simply hilarious! He was very knowledgeable about the history of Amsterdam, and kept us all entertained with his numerous and humerous stories about his country.

So, I decided to go on Mike's Bikes countryside tour.The tour was great. It had been a while since I'd ridden a bike and I'm turning 50 soon. Safe to say I'm not in the best shape I've ever been in. The tour was fun, interesting and the ride was easy. We rode through the city, getting a little bit of history on the way until we rode along the dyke on the Amstel River, visited a windmill and finally a farm and wooden shoe factory.The whole trip was a blast, the scenery was gorgeous and the trail network was just mind-blowing.The best part of the whole thing was that I was able to rent a bike for a week at 1/2 price because I had taken the tour. Now I have a bike and a map and plan to get out of the city as much as I can.I don't know about the other bike rental companies, but my experience with Mike's Bikes has been outstanding. There are really good people working there. They are helpful and friendly and they know what they are doing. And the tour guide was full of information and kept us entertained.Two thumbs up for Mike's Bikes Tours."

Crazy getting out of the centre of the city of Amsterdam but once away from the cars,trams and commuters,It was a very nice bike ride.Our guide Steve was very knowlegable about Amsterdam and the Nederlands in general and was also quite funny!The mountains (canal bridges) were tough to get up if you didn't get a running start or in the wrong gear and the whole time our guide was always keeping an eye out for his charges.A bright red teeshirt at the rear in the guize of Roy,was a big help! as we made our way to the country,we saw most unusual living quarters and so really beautiful farming lands.The cheese farm we visited was a tourist stop but heck,,,thats why we were there and with some wooden shoes and acouple of rounds of gouda we were off and pumpin.This trip includes a few breaks,one being at a windmill that was quite beautiful and a stop in Vondel Park for more information from our guide.Then back to town for the mad dash to our starting point.All in all it was a very lovley experiance,one anybody should do if they go to Amsterdam. Mike's Bikes...A+ Thanks for the memories! Rick from Jersey!"

He's funny, knowledgeable and has plenty of interesting stories to share during stops, so the only way to have him tell more stories is to hope more people in the group have punctured tyres!The countryside is such a lovely cycling trail, paved cycling paths, river on one side and beautiful dutch houses on the other. The windmill is a great place to take pictures and i thought the chesse and clog farm was very interesting. Not much other opportunities to take pictures except at stops but its sufficient just to enjoy cycling past the countryside and taking everything in. And of course, asking Shaun lots of questions from the history of Europe to how the windmill works to nice places to get Dutch food."

            "review": "Loved it!. We loved this tour. We chose the countyside tour and arrived just on time. Our guide was originally from Canada and did a great job. Unfortunately I can't remember his name. There were about 15 in the group my husband, because he is tall, was chosen to bring up the rear and make sure no one got lost. That was fine by me as we could go at our own pace. The bikes were great, easy to manoeuvre and with saddle bags to handle our sweaters & water bottles. The tour is billed at 4 hours but it was about 40 minutes before we even left the bike garage. We stopped at the Magre Brug for a little history on Amsterdam, then biked out through the countryside on gorgeous paved trails along the dykes. Biking in the city was a little intimidating at first, but once we got into the countryside it was calm and lovely. We stopped at a windmill where tour busses dropped of groups as well. Had a few pics and a little more history of the area, then on to the cheese & clog farm. There was a bathroom and our guide offered us all a beer for \u20ac1, then we went inside. It seemed like a humble little family operation at first. They gave us a demo on cheesemaking and a little sample, then showed us clog making. Then we were led into the store which was huge and had tons of tacky Dutch souvenirs, clogs and cheese. We did buy a bit (cash only) and then we were on our way again. We biked through more dykes, farmland and canals full of houseboats, then back into the city and through Vondelpark, which is lovely. We aren\u2019t in top shape but weren\u2019t too exhausted after 3 hours of riding. I thought it was good value at \u20ac22 per person. But we had forgotten to have breakfast and there was no stop for lunch so we were starving by the time it was over. Also had spent all our cash at the clog/cheese factory so had to pay by credit card which was no problem.Highly recommended for great scenery."

Good route choice departing and arriving back to Amsterdam city. Amazing how quick we had the city behind us and the infrastructure of the bike lanes very impressive. Mikes shop in Kerkstraat is excellent for location and decor. I think what I personally was a little disappointed with was the too long stop at the windmill factory where we were presented with how to make Dutch cheese and clogs! And then led into a showroom to buy samples of it all. Here the ike tour lost a little of \"bike experience\" in my book and became just like another sight-seeing tour. This stop was far too long as well. Maybe also a few more stops enroute would suit the tour - the guide, \"Egg\", seemed to know lots more than he shared around on the day. But all up: A recommendable excursion - just bring a little patience while being parked at the touristy clogs/cheese windmill."

            "review": "A Different Side of Amsterdam. After reading reviews, a friend and I decided to take the Countryside Bike Tour. We appreciated the fact that reservations were not necessary. We simply showed up at the address on their website (Kerkstraat # 123) at 11:00am and we were accommodated. Approximately 40 people showed up for the tour and there were two guides, so there were 20 bikers in each group. Although this may seem like a large group, the guides were great at making sure no one got lost or was left behind.The tour is about 18 miles long, but do not let this deter you from taking the tour. I am by no means an expert bike rider. In fact, I would probably describe myself as an inexperienced, accident prone bike rider, and I both survived and enjoyed the tour. Although the beginning of the tour takes you through busier streets with cars and other bikers, 90% or more of the tour is on deserted or isolated countryside roads (hence the name of the tour), where there is little risk of getting hit by a car or another biker, or falling into a canal, etc. Petra was our tour guide and she was an absolute delight. She was informative, enthusiastic, and fun. You can tell that she really enjoys her job, which leads to an enjoyable experience for all on her tour. The tour included official stops at a windmill and a cheese and clog farm. Some unofficial stops included a lake, a park, a Picasso, and a stop along the road to taste some berries. The bike ride is peaceful, and you will have the opportunity to see cows, horses, parks, families having picnics, canals, trees, etc. I would recommend that you give your camera to the most experienced bike rider in the group (someone who can simultaneously ride his or her bike and take pictures). At the end of the tour, everyone pays for their tour. It is 22 Euros per person and 19 Euros if you are a student or senior. If you have ANY student identification card, they will honor it and give you the discount. Just don't forget to bring it with you!I highly recommend this tour to anyone. It is a nice contrast to the Red Light District and the coffee shops. Enjoy!"

Its a great way to get out of the city (is only in the city for about 20 mins - with one stop to be told something). Its great to get on a bike and get out into the countryside and see all the house boats. City forrest is also beautiful to ride through. Our guide was terrible though. If you get there and have a choice of tourguides - DO NOT go with the girl with dreadlocks, I think her name was Patrice. She was the worst tourguide i have come across. She was patronising and false when talking about things.I've been on 2 Mikes Bikes tours before and had a blast - so it really does come down to your guide.In saying that - its an easy stressfree way of going for a long ride around amsterdam area - just dont expect to find out anything new about what you might be looking at.Ps. No chance for photostops (except at the windmill)."

We got to see a windmill, cheese factory and clog factory plus see some of the stuff outside the city. I was a little disappointed because I thought we were going to get to see more of the city itself, but instead you ride through a lot of parks.

A good 1.5 hour is spent in silence riding to and from the farm house, the farm tour is excellent but the souvenirs there are over priced. The same souvenirs are available throughout the city for half the price- (IE mini clog bank 5euros vs 10euros). The ride is not as easy as they claim- atleast half of our group would not be able to make it over canals without walking their bikes. Does not include a canal tour as some have claimed on this forum. Would recommend it though."

            "review": "A Must-Do even if the weather's bad!. Went on the Countryside Tour with a group of 5 others in late April and despite the rainy weather, we all had an amazing time! Not having been on a bike for years, and coming from a country that's driving on the wrong side of the road, I expressed my concerns to Petra, our guide about not being able to keep up with the rest. Petra was extremely reassuring and the rest of the group members were also kind enough to keep a lookout for me in case I fall behind. Petra gave us a brief history of the Netherlands before we started out on the tour proper - in typical Dutch humour which I totally enjoy and appreciate. It was tough trying to scale the first slope in the city, but I gradually got the hang of changing gears when a slope is approaching and was able to maneuver through the streets of Amsterdam rather successfully by the end of the tour!As others have mentioned, the tour first arrived at a windmill for some photo ops and then on to a cheese and clog factory. It wasn't even the thrill of seeing a windmill or sampling the famed Dutch cheeses that made this tour so amazing. It was simply the joy of cycling in the midst of the beautiful landscape of Amsterdam and into the countryside, where ducks waded and beautiful tulips abound. The fact that it was raining actually made the cycling even more pleasurable. It felt so refreshing to be out there on a bike in the drizzle with raindrops pelting onto your face - even though we were all craving for a hot chocolate at the end of the tour because of the cold.Since we were a small group, it wasn't too difficult for us to keep speed with one another. Petra had this really bright orange daisy on her bike - so you can always see her from afar and know you're not following the wrong bicycle. On top of that, she stopped often and made sure that every member of the group was present before we rode on.It was seeing Amsterdam in an atypical manner - witnessing the beauty of nature at its best by weaving right through it - instead of merely looking at it through the windows of a tour bus. We had some extra time left towards the end of the tour and headed to Vondelpark where Petra amused us yet again with stories of the Dutch's liberal laws (apparently sex in the park is legal!). We also saw The Fish, a Picasso sculpture at Vondelpark and then cycled through Leideseplein before we headed back to the shop to return our bikes. By then, I was already a relatively accomplished cyclist who was capable of handling the many slopes of Amsterdam!"

So if you want to participate in the local transport, then head over to Mike's Bikes. Now, we're no Lance Armstrong, but we're casual bike riders. The countryside tour that we took was 3.5 hours long, and even our biking butts were sore at the end. It's not strenuous if you're in shape, but if you think 45 minutes straight on a bike might be too much, then I'd reconsider. :)There are several options at Mike\u2019s Bikes. You can just rent a bike for a day (be sure to lock both the wheels and the body, as even Rick Steves had his bike stolen, and he's a travel wiz!) or you can join a bike tour. Mike's Bikes has a new (2009) city tour of Amsterdam, or there is the countryside tour. I was intimidated just walking among all the bikes in the city (and avoiding the people ringing their bells at me) so we chose to venture a bit outside the city limits on the countryside tour, which takes you to a windmill and a cheese and wooden shoe farm. The countryside tour is led by a guide, and ours (Shawn) was well-informed, if only slightly haughty in his professorship of us. My complaints about the tour would be these:1. I think the size of the group was too large. We had about 15 bikers, and when you\u2019ve got that many people in a single file line, the chances of all 15 making it across a busy intersection before the light changes is not good. I found myself in that situation quite a few times, where half of the group was light-years ahead and the other half stopped by a light. I was concerned that we would lose the guide and be stranded where we didn\u2019t know where we were. He did stop and wait for us each time, but I still would\u2019ve preferred a smaller group.2. I'm a photo hound. I wanted more picture stops. With the group size situation mentioned above, I was scared to stop and shoot for fear that I would get lost.The cheese shop (and the free samples) was amazing, and I made an impulse cheese buy and also bought a pair of wooden shoes. Because it was a sunny Amsterdam day, we biked the long way home (which I did standing up, because I was so sore!). We came back through Beatrix Park as well as Vondel Park, which was beyond crowded thanks to the nice weather. Make sure you know what the people in your group look like, or you may end up following another biker another place!Of my top Amsterdam activities, I'd place this as number 2 - with number one being a canal tour. So I'd say that's a pretty good recommendation!"

I bought the city tour that was supposed to have a canal ride. Most important point is, this tour is NOT fit for those who don't exercise regularly and/or are pretty fit. I'm in my late-20's and used to play sports regularly but haven't done anything too active for ~5 years now. I'm considered healthy & quite fit by my doctor. The biking for this tour felt like I did a marathon. I sorta did, since my tour was 3-4 hours long of almost continual biking on not entirely flat terrain. So beware those who are out of shape, this is NOT for you!Another gripe: The canal didn't show up after my group had waited for about half an hour at the designated site. We were offered vouchers to take a free canal ride at another time. It was just a day trip for me, so I lost out on any canal ride, which I really wanted to do. Plus side is, they amended my fee & charged me the rate of the city tour without canal ride.Also, I guess this would be a good tour for those who don't want the touristy things & just want to go through neighborhoods & see \"the real city\". I was disappointed because most of what I saw or took pictures of were not recognizable to family & friends. Guess I wanted a more \"touristy\" tour."

There is a choice of 2 tours, Bike and Boat tour, which concentrates more on Amsterdam town, and the Countryside tour, which we chose, as we wanted to see outside the city centre.We waited outside the Rijksmuseum, by the reflecting pool, and Sean duly turned up and gave us a quick potted, entertaining history of the Netherlands. Then a quick walk to the garage a few blocks away to collect the bikes. We saw an old 17th century windmill (occupied, so we kept a respectful distance!) and then onto a cheese/clog factory. The owner gave a very amusing chat about cheese and clogs, which cleverly persuaded you to buy some cheese to take home! (Garlic & herb cheese: delicious, but keep it in the fridge as the outside goes mouldy quickly!!) We cycled back past the Hilton Hotel where John Lennon & Yoko Ono did the \"hair peace/bed peace\" thing - writing on the window just about visible. Through Vondelpark, enjoying a drink and a sit down, before cycling back.Sean, our guide, was very knowledgeable, and very friendly. I liked the whole informal vibe of the set-up, ie enjoy the tour and pay at the end (to elicit more tips!!) Gives you a really good feel for the place. Waterproofs are provided, but maybe bring your own, as it often rains. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

There was no need to worry , although the weather was threatening it didn't rain and the ease of the ride was great. Our guide was Sean , an American with dutch roots, and he was fantastic. His knowledge of Amsterdam both past and present was exceptional. We were lucky there were only 7 in our group, there is usually up to 20 and this made for a more intimate ride as we got to know the other riders. The ride was a highlight of our Amsterdam stay and would recommend it to any one of any age."

Frankie was our tour guide and not only was he informative, but hilarious and fun. There were about 20 of us on the tour and he kept track of all of us and made sure we had a good time. I could think of NO better way to see Munich than this Bike tour. The tour is a few hours long and at a nice leisurely pace. Plenty of time for picture taking along the way and also as well as a pit stop in one of Munich's (and the world's) biggest beer gardens. I highly recommend this tour to anyone going to Munich!

We met near the Rikesmuseum, walked over to their shop, got our bikes and started the tour. The guide told us a bit about road safety (though funny, none of us wore helmets, though on the other hand neither do any of the locals, which is odd to me as an avid road cyclist.) We toured around several parts of Amsterdam via roads and bike lanes. It felt safe at all times due to the bikecentric vibe in Amsterdam. We stopped at several points in the tour to talk about various points of interest. After touring the city a bit, we stopped at one of the windmills, talked a bit more about Amsterdam, took some pictures, and then proceeded on to the cheese farm / clog factory. Though the farm is a bit of a tourist spot as much as a working farm, it was interesting to see it. From there we proceeded back to Amsterdam, toured Vondelpark, stopped for a drink at a cafe, and then headed back to the shop. All in all it was a great way to see Amsterdam, move around like a local, and have a good time. The bikes were in great shape, and were overall good to ride. (though of course they are not as nice as our road bikes at home!) The bikes were Townie Electras which is a good brand with good components. Our group was 10 people plus the guide which was a great size for this tour. A few more would be okay, but no more than 20 which I think is their limit. They did not take our payments till after the tour. I would reccomend this tour to anyone visiting Amsterdam. As long as you can ride a bike you will have a great time."

Our guide was Sean, an American who has lived in Amsterdam for 10 years. We were really lucky that there were only 5 people on our tour, (not the norm according to Sean. He said he usually has 15 0r 20 people). We rode around Amsterdam for about 2 hours, stopping here and there to learn about the history of the city. We both found it fascinating and very enjoyable. After the bike ride, we went on a leisurely canal boat ride, which although not \"guided\" was very relaxing and a fun way to see a lot of the city. Sean did continue to point out things of interest -- although mostly we just chatted with him and the others on the tour. The traffic in Amsterdam, both cars and bikes, is a little nerve racking, but the ride is slow enough and flat enough that anyone can do it."

I sent an email and got a confirmation by the next morning on where to meet (which is on their website too). Easy!I was traveling alone in Amsterdam and met a few other very nice people in the group. I took the Sunday tour which takes shows you some of Amsterdam outside of the touristy area. It's stated as a 4 hour tour but it's worth the time. It's been a number of years since I rode a bicycle, but the ride was very easy. We saw the suburb areas where the average person lives and also saw some fancier neighborhoods. We rode through Vondelpark (like NY's Central Park but in Amsterdam), which is very nice especially since we had amazing weather (sunny, warm, breezy) for riding a bike. We went to a couple of windmills and a cheese and clog-making farm (seems a little touristy because a big busload of tourists arrived as we were leaving, but it was still fun - you can't really go to holland without seeing cheese and clogs!). At the second windmill, we stopped to get beer and all of us stood by the canal and hung out. Great times! I liked riding through the streets (almost like a local!) and seeing the other parts of Amsterdam besides the touristy museums, it made my visit more complete.I also have to say to that our guide, Pete, was wonderful! He was full of knowledge, before we left the meeting point, he gave us a quick highlights history of Amsterdam and while we were biking he would tell us stories about each area. I did not know anyone in amsterdam, so it was great to hear about what the locals think about their society, politics and the world. Also, I stupidly left my sunglasses in the bicycle pouch when I left and I only realized it when I was about to fly. I called them up when I got back to the united states and they had found it and kept it in lost and found. They are perfectly happy to make arrangements to have it sent back to me. All in all, Mike's Bike Tour is a great group of people and a fun tour!Btw, there's a student discount. If you show your student ID (I showed my american college id) you only pay 19euros, otherwise it's also worth everybit of 22euros!"

We went on a Winter Tour late Feburary (only runs Friday & Saturdays) Mike was there on arrival & was really friendly, as were all the staff. Our guide Shawn was possibly the most enthusiastic tour guide I have met. Usually I get irritated by the lack of real interest by tour guides & their ability to flee at the end of a tour or when you ask a question... or even not waiting for all the group before talking. My only problem here was I couldn't think of anything else to ask - dutch history, drugs, [--], wars, trading, politics, monarchy and of course bike riding.. all these topics & more were covered. We saw the cheese farm/clog factory (yes touristy, but fun, i mean I've never seen clogs made before! and was a working farm/factory - also nice to see a bit outside the main city), the Hilton (John & Yoko), rode through different districts in amsterdam with info given on each of them, Vondelpark, Beatrixpark, and rode down the road (!) that the Germans used to flee from Amsterdam. Great for an overview of Amsterdam, both historically & geographically ... and what better way to do that than on bikes! Before leaving we rented bikes (half price as we had been on the tour) and got some info on good places to go (villages outside amsterdam). Would recommend to anyone that can cycle & will definately be renting from Mike's Bikes next time we are there."

Our book club decided to do one of Mark's walking tours of Amsterdam based on the book \u2018Amsterdam: A History of the World\u2019s Most Liberal City\u2019. We were all familiar with Amsterdam and choose Mark to show us a side to Amsterdam we wouldn't have seen. He succeed. We walked down streets we had never been on, past canals we hadn\u2019t seen before, and went to a restaurant that I for one had been by several times before and had no idea it was there. Mark was very easy going about the tour and at the end of the day my mouth was sore from laughing (always the sign of a good day). It was a great day for our entire group and many of the ladies are thinking of organizing another tour with Mark either for our group or with visitors to the Netherlands."

Lealu was punctual, and quite pleasant. During both tours she did a great job of keeping our group of about 7 tourists together, and quickly she had the group melded together as new friends. She showed us so many city sights, and history, that it was a great overview. The red light tour was very very good also. It was extremely busy there on a Saturday night, we would have never ventured through it on our own. She kept our group together, and seemed very conscious of each of us, which we all appreciated. She shared all sorts of insight that we would never have known about the women, lifestyles, and neighborhood. Thank you so much Lealu, we thoroughly enjoyed our time with you ! We felt that it was time very well spent with you."

He is knowledgeable, very friendly and very cheerful :)He took us to all places with beautiful sceneries. A small village, Monnickendam, a farm and the windmill. I can see a lot of animals and nature in this tour in which I didn't expect before this trip and hardly I can find in my current living city.Besides, we can ask a lot of questions and he gave us plenty of time to enjoy and take pictures. I never feel there s a moment of rush and enjoy the beauty of nature.We drank coffee, ate apple pie and have a picnic tasting different cheeses.Thank you Mark! I agree what you say this leaves me unforgettable memories in this tour and I love Amsterdam even more"

And when the cow fill the need to be milked, it was incredible!

This full-day tour fully met our expectations, and then some. Our group was small - just four people. We visited a couple small villages, a local farm and a windmill.

Not knowing what to expect we had high hopes. Since we were only there for a long weekend (not enough time to spend in Amsterdam, wish I didn't have to come back), we figured we'd do a walking tour to immerse ourselves in the culture and history of this amazing city. Trust me when I say our expectations were blown away!! WE LOVED LEALU SO MUCH! The Red Light district tour was great! We learned so much from how it began to how it's currently running! After the tour we were able to navigate around the charming Amsterdam streets. We loved everything about it. The small intimate size of the tour, the personal touches Lealu added, and the local insight on the city. We loved the tour so much we reached out to the company asking if there were any possibilities to join the Historical walking tour while we were there. They were so accommodating and willing to help fit our schedule it was no problem at all! Luckily, we had Lealu as our tour guide once again on this tour and it was even better! We actually became friends! Before we even started this tour she asked everyone if it would be okay if we went a little over time. We all mutually agreed and Lealu took her time explaining historical figures as we walked around Amsterdam. Totally recommend doing this tour on a Sunday morning as not that many people were out. We really had the chance to connect with Lealu and we all stopped for a quick bite in one of her favorite hidden cafes!Look no further, I truly mean it! These guys are great in accommodating your needs, keeping tours personal and intimate with small group numbers, and just all around amazing genuine people! We totally would have done the country tour if we had more time! Honestly doesn't matter how old you are, I totally recommend this tour- especially with Lealu (no offense to the other tour guides, I bet you're great, just had Lealu on both tours)"

We had the small towns and villages we visited all to ourselves while enjoying a delicious apple pie and coffee treat. But what was most surprising was how interesting the visit to the dairy and tulip bulb farm we visited. The use of more humane treatment coupled with high technology really intrigued our whole group. And learning about the harvest of bulbs was a unknown market to us. The Dutch use every inch of land they have for farming and Rory went in-depth about water management which is quite a feat. We were a bit of an inquisitive group and Rory always had the answers. Only thought he might have engaged more while driving, but he got us everywhere safely! Our cheese tasting picnic was the end to a great day. Small group tours all the way!!"

We walked through Monnickendam to admire the architecture of this small quaint gem. Stopped for a refreshment and apple pie which allowed us to get to know one another a bit more. Our final destination was the Schermer Windmills. We were able to go inside to see the interior design as the workings and history were described. We then sat down to a cheery light picnic fare of which the highlight was Beemster Cheese. All in it was a lovely day spent with a terrific guide...Mark!"

We saw dykes, and visited the town of Monnickendam where Mark takes his guests for Dutch apple pie and coffee at the perfect coffee break time along with a walking tour of the town. We drove by Edam, visited a farm that raises tulips and is also a dairy. We explored a working windmill and Mark provided a lovely picnic. Rather than drive back to the center of town, Mark dropped us at the free ferry which took us across the river and just a few blocks from hotel. It was a wonderful day made so very special by being a small group and visiting places where there were only a few other tourists. One can tell that Mark has spent hours scouting out places to take his clients. We would definitely take the same tour again because I am sure Mark will have found interesting new places to visit."

Rory is a fun, friendly and professional guide, he planned a day packed as full as possible....we requested to see everything we possibly could! The highlight was the windmill in Schermerhorn....wonderful! This is a tour that allows a lovely glimpse of The Netherlands without being in a crowd with other tourists.

At the end of the week, we joined Rory's countryside tour, for a break from the city. We are so glad we did! In a relatively short drive away from Amsterdam, we were in the Dutch countryside of dikes, farms, cows, tulip bulbs, cheese and windmills. Not only was it a lovely peaceful drive, we learned about managing water to create this rich farmland and visited a pretty waterside town where we were the only tourists. It was a great way to end our packed week.Both Mark and Rory are excellent guides, informed and informative, humorous and interesting. We both recommend That Dam Guide without reservation.

Most tour buses travel with a huge group which would be far too crowded for these charming windmills. We also visited small towns, a farm and a cheese shop.

The walking tour they designed covers a little piece of each neighborhood in Amsterdam. Lealu shared information only a local would know and had a good humor. The tour is lengthy and you should be prepared to cover quite a bit of ground-good shoes and energy are needed. The city is all hustle and bustle and you should definately be aware of the bikes! Anyone can enjoy this tour although young children might not appreciate the value of it."

I ended up being glad that we went on the Countryside Tour first because it gave a great overview of the Dutch water management system (more exciting than it sounds) and it gave more context to the City Tour. The Countryside Tour was definitely the highlight of our trip. Rory is really knowledgeable and has a great sense of humor. I thought the entire tour was really well designed and fascinating. It's the perfect pace- never boring or rushed. All the stops are great, but I did especially love the visit to the dairy farm. The apple pie stop and the wine and cheese picnic weren't too bad either. Highly recommend this tour.We went on the City Walking Tour a couple of days later and had a great time with Mark. It's a small group, and you learn a lot about the history and culture of the city. Mark is a very enthusiastic and conscientious guide, and I enjoyed his insight into various aspects of Amsterdam life."

Doing the city tour on our first day in Amsterdam was a great introduction to the city, gives you an idea of where all the major attractions are and helps you plan the rest of your stay. Mark is a fun and knowledgeable tour guide, who pointed out many things that one would normally miss if walking unguided. He had many recommendations, and even discounts, for things to do after the tour. Our group of ten, which is his maximum, was the perfect size for walking the narrow streets of central Amsterdam.The Countryside tour, which is limited to seven, was fantastic. We visited a couple of small towns, stopped into a caf\u00e9 off the beaten path with a beautiful inner courtyard, observed fish smoking, visited a small farm and got to chat with the farmers for some time and of course a windmill where we observed the inside of the working windmill and took the requisite touristy photos. Mark brought a lovely picnic lunch and we sat around chatting surrounded by the Dutch countryside. Our small van allowed us to go and see places where the larger tour buses don\u2019t go and created a friendly atmosphere for the entire experience. We even sent Mark out on a reconnaissance mission to identify a vegetable field. He obliged like a good sport. Now I\u2019m keeping my promise.There are free tours out there but with far larger groups. With That Dam Guide you\u2019re paying for a more intimate experience. It is worth every euro cent."

We were a group of six (age: 60ish) world travelers looking for a good individualized / small group tour where we could see the culture, hear about the history, and ask lots of questions. We read trip advisor and decided on That Dam Guide (Mark Law). Pre trip planning and communication set the tone of efficiency and piqued our interest in the adventure. Mark met us at the Hotel, introductions all around, and we were off to the country (really into the country immediately, not a long trip on the motorway to get to the country). We stopped in a little town along the dike for a history and geography discussion (Mark is very interesting and has a number of \"map\" aids to help us understand \"Amsterdam\". We then visited a small town (very pleasant walk through cobblestone streets and discussed more of the culture stopping for a delicious slice of apple pie and drinks. Then off to a local farm were we got up close and personal with the cows, the tulip harvesting, and the owner - fun! Finally we did the \"windmill\" and a fantastic picnic. We now know so much more about Amsterdam, the culture, the history and had an opportunity to have a wonderful day in the countryside. Mark did an excellent job, clearly is attentive to every detail both in the planning and execution and is very flexible to meet the needs / desires of the group. (the picnic spread provided by Mark was \"to die for\" and was just another highlight) - this is a tour designed for small groups that want to have a personalized experience and not get caught up in the \"large tourist bus full of pushy people\" paradigm. I would and will strongly recommend this tour to everyone as a must do when in Amsterdam. Bottom line: \"IT WAS FUN AND WILL BE FOREVER REMEMBERED\" - Thank you Mark for taking such good care of us! PS: not only did he provide us with a great day in the country but followed on by giving us a great recommendation for dinner at Cote Quest as we got back into town - I wish we had hired him to do the city walk and red light district also."

You can choose a typical large group tour, you know the sort of thing, 30 people trailing after a guide, sometimes with headphones as it's almost impossible to get such a large group together in this area to talk to the guide direct.OR 2. You can book a tour with That Dam Guide. They are really amazing and here's why. They offer genuine small group tours. There were 5 on our tour last night so we could listen and chat to Mark, our guide, throughout the 2 hour tour. Mark has a wealth of knowledge not just about the area but also all aspects of what it's like for the girls who work in the area and the challenges they face. He showed the utmost respect for the girls. Whereas we saw the large group tours pointing, sniggering and giggling which after Mark's explanations seemed disrespectful and inappropriate.It's not all serious though as Mark is a really funny guy and we had a lot of fun with him! Lastly, he sent us links to his blog and other related sites where we could get great advice for best places in the city and follow up on aspects of the tour.So, the choice is yours, which type of tour would you prefer?Thanks a lot Mark!Helen and David - 15 Aug"

She did a fantastic job of answering our many questions while maintaining her narrative through the streets and byways of old Amsterdam. It is impossible to think of how it could have been better for us. Thank you, Lealu, for a lovely afternoon. Even though we were jet-lagged, you informed and entertained us in such a delightful way!"

We went to a lovely fishing town and had the best apple pie at a super charming facility for challenged adults. I know it sounds a little odd but it was just lovely Mark is so easy-going and informative. The countryside was amazing. We had a wonderful tour of a windmill like I had never seen it before and a trip to great farmI would definitely recommend it and also suggest that you book with him directly and not through another bigger"

Stopped for coffee and apple pie at a lovely venue and also had a wine and cheese picnic at the Windmill. Great day out."

We have traveled extensively before and after our Amsterdam trip and by and far this was the best private guide we have ever had (equaling Hong Kong.) In Amsterdam we were a party of two families with four teens total. We got to see so much of the city and fall in love with old style Europe. The surroundings feel old, but the environment feels new. Mark is able to excite all ages and give pertinent information as you spend your hours with him. He joined us for lunch at the end and felt like one of the family. Lastly Mark sent an email with interesting video and book suggestions that came up during our time walking Amsterdam with him. That is the true making of a complete guide! Sorry for the delay in this review, but better late than never."

When we arrive in a new European city, the first thing we like to do is take an informative tour and learn about the city, country and its culture. We want a real tour that includes extensive facts and stories (not just glossy overviews by some student). We hit the jackpot with the tour by That Dam Guide. We signed up for the countryside tour by van and it turned out to be a private tour (just us two) and Rory, our guide, was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the Dutch Water management system and other aspects of Holland. The tour is an excellent value as you visit a long list of places and Rory did a great job keeping it interesting and fun:1) We drove east out of Amsterdam and stopped at the little dike village of Durgerdam, where Rory gave an overview of the day. 2) We drove back-roads through Waterland and learned all about the Dutch Water management system. It was amazing to learn about how the Dutch people are so industrious.3) We stopped off and explored Monnickendam (Monks Dam). We had coffee and delicious apple pie at the Weeshuis (which means orphanage).4) We visited a working dairy farm and met the wonderful hard-working owners and received a tour of their automated milking process and how they store, sort and sell their two million tulip bulbs - fascinating facts and stories!5) We stopped to taste and buy cheese at a local cooperative, Beemster Cheese, for an afternoon picnic. The tasting was great and the cheese store will vacuum seal the cheese (good for up to two months) so you can take some home. It is a real store (not just show) and you get in line with locals to buy cheese - a tasty and fun experience!6) We stopped in Schermerhorn where we visited a windmill. This is where we had a picnic and toured the inside of a windmill and learned about how it operates and serves as a residence so it can be turned into the wind on a 24/7 basis - again, fascinating stuff and Rory, our guide did a great job educating us!If you are looking for a wonderful tour of Amsterdam and the surrounding areas filled with tons of informative facts and stories, you need to take a countryside tour with That Dam Guide!"

Lealu was also great at setting a good walking pace for us seeing as we had just arrived to Amsterdam and was running on no sleep! Highlights of the tour included a shop that only sells products from family businesses that have been around for over a hundred years (approx.) and the best rated fries shop in Holland!

Following an in-line skating trip with my wife, we completed our vacation with a stop in Amsterdam for a couple of days prior to returning home. Having scheduled the \"Red Light\" & \"City Walking\" tours we found that our time was well spent. With Benjamin as our guide, we plied our way throughout the city while he provided the narrative & details we would not have noted on our own, or may not have read about. He was very knowledgeable of the city highlights and provided many wonderful insights into the history of the city and the impacts affecting it today. Having a bit of humor certainly added to the entertain value of the tours. We then followed up the city tour with the \"Countryside\" tour the next day. We had a fabulous time with Rory as well. Having a smaller tour group, 6 people, certainly made this experience so much better than one of the larger corporate tours. Rory had taken us to several places that we would not have otherwise ventured too, we were very happy with the cities and places we had visited. Exploring Monnickendam and stopping for coffee and pie at a local orphanage made for a splendid morning. We then headed out to stop by one of the dairy & Tulip farms, it was surprising to see how modernized the farm is. Our last stop, Schermermolen, was a visit to see a working windmill. It's amazing how the windmills were originally built and for the purpose behind them. Rory covered the history of the windmills and why they were put in place and how they are still in use today.We had a wonderful time and experience with both guides, Benjamin & Rory. Both guides are very knowledgeable with the history of Amsterdam and the surrounding areas. They made the last few days of our vacation very memorable and we were thankful to spend time with them."

He is so knowledgeable regarding not only the history of Amsterdam but also it's culture, architecture,customs and foods. Combine that with an outgoing, friendly personality and a great sense of humor and you have the perfect tour guide. Benjamin said, \" I don't love Amsterdam because I live here. I live here because I love Amsterdam. \" His pride in his city really showed. I think that is the reason this tour is so good. It's not guided by someone \" just doing a job\" but by someone who truly loves his city and wants to show it off and share it with others.  We took the tour the day after we arrived and it really helped us to learn a lot about Amsterdam and orient us to the city which helped us when walking around later in our trip. I love that this tour is small. We had 10 people in our group. I never felt like I was being rushed along and Benjamin was very open to us asking questions. I highly recommend this tour !! PS It did rain some on the tour but I had several umbrellas with us and the rain did nothing to detract from the tour."

Having been to Amsterdam before, we wanted something really unique outside the city and Mark, owner of That Dam Guide tour company, provided it and more. From my initial contact with him, everything was very professional and caring in the way he helped make provisions for my husband's limited mobility. On the day of the tour, to say he went out of his way to help my husband is an understatement. Our visits to small local waterland towns (read no tourist buses in our way) were wonderful and punctuated with a unique apple pie stop. Our stop at a small, but very automated farm with many diversified products was even enlightening to this former 4-Her. Learning about water management in the Netherlands was facinating, but seeing it in action was even better. Our fun day was rounded out with windmills, a picnic (wine, cheese, nibblies,etc) and a cheese factory. Even my well-traveled and hard-to-please husband had a great day. Do yourself a favor and book with Mark and his associates at That Dam Guide tour company, while in the Amsterdam area. Money well spent!!!"

His email correspondence with Shirley was always prompt and professional. Mark is an extremely knowledgeable guide and taught us a lot of different things about Amsterdam from history to present day. He was very good about giving us tips on how to be safe from pick pockets and advice on the culture in Amsterdam. He is also a very fun guide and a good sport with pictures and answering all of our questions. He is very good at gauging his audience and was very patient. We didn't feel rushed and overwhelmed. The walking tour with Mark was a great way to be introduced to the beautiful city of Amsterdam. Thanks Mark :)"

For starters, Guys have impeccable work ethic - Mark answered all my emails, even not related to the tour (questions about the city) very quickly. He gave us a great tour, did not try selling us anything, and although we had a break, it was short (around 15 min) with great coffee (and cheap one) mostly for bathroom use. They do stick to small group policy - our friends wanted to join us on a full tour and Mark offered other time options but did not add two people to the full group. We learned a lot and enjoyed every moment of it. The next day was a Country tour. Rory met us well in advance and with our agreement waited for 15 min for the couple, running late (they never showed up). We went to the beautiful countryside, village where we met only four tourists with their guide. It was definitely not a tourist attraction, rather the small nice town. We had a tasty apple pie and tried herring and eel. After spending time in the country we ended the tour with visiting windmills and a great picnic with cheese tasting, wine, and meat. We never felt rushed, had friendly conversations with other tourists, and overall had a great time. After both tours we got follow up emails with links to different information. We had many tours over the years, but this company definitely stands out."

After contacting him, we were pleased to learn that his associate Lealu would be available to take us on a 2 hour guided tour.First and foremost, both Mark and Lealu were extremely professional, provided specific instructions on when and where to meet, the cost, and even pictures of Lealu and the location to insure that we could meet her. As this was all done over email, it definitely made the process significantly easier having a picture.On the day of our tour, Lealu was prompt and wearing the very obvious pom that was in her picture. We approached her and she immediately identified herself and was extremely courteous and firendly.The tour itself was exactly what we wanted. Lealu lives and has worked in one of the shops in the Red Light District giving her an intimate knowledge of the location. She provided an informative perspective on both the lives of the women working there, the culture, businesses, and helped to dispel the myths and misconceptions about the RLD. She was unabashed and did not shy away from subjects that could be considered sensitive and told both the good and the bad allowing us to form our own judgements from facts. We walked throughout the entire area, crossing the various canals, going past the coffee shops, \"theaters\", windows, churches, canals, and even the 5 star restaurant. Even as it started to rain, Lealu assured us that she would continue the tour and wasn't done until we had seen everything, regardless of the time. I truly believe that we got an insiders perspective of the RLD. Lealu was very friendly, extremely knowledgeable, and well worth the money and time invested. The next day, we had an included tour from our River Cruise and they brushed through the RLD with an almost \"avert\" your eyes attitude. Having spent the previous evening with Lealu, we were disappointed by the way that guide avoided the subject. If you are at all interested in learning about the Red Light District, I strongly recommend spending the time and money with Lealu. You won't regret it."

We stopped at two quaint villages, were treated to Dutch apple pie and coffee, and tried a strumpwafel. We then visited a farm that produces milk for the local cheese industry before heading to a windmill area. At the windmill, we were able to climb up inside and see it working, without crowds! Afterward, Mark treated us to a picnic lunch with different varieties of local cheeses, as well as wine, grapes, meats and crackers before we headed back to Amsterdam.

Rob also took us to a delightful cafe for a perfectly timed break.The group was small, which made the walk more personal and pleasurable. I will take this for again when I return to this beautiful city!"

We checked into our hotel and then proceeded to meet our guide from \"That Dam Guide.\" Our guide's name was, Rob, and he was nothing short of AMAZING!!!! We were a group of 6 and there were 4 additional people in our group. Rob made each and everyone of us feel like we were the only ones on the tour!!! This was a three hour walking tour of Amsterdam and in that short amount of time I'm pretty sure Rob took us to EVERY neighborhood in Amsterdam!!! His knowledge of his adopted city is EXTENSIVE (he's originally from NJ in the USA!!)!!! He regaled us with great stories about life in Amsterdam!! His energy and passion for the city was wonderful!! Our group learned so much in such a short period of time!! He had keen insight into Amsterdam's history, government, social norms and simply everyday living. He was able to squeeze in a quick stop to an out of the way cafe (only the locals know about) for a quick coffee and cake break...the apple cake was delicious!! I'm so very glad we decided to do this tour on our very first day in Amsterdam!! I\"m so very glad we decided to choose \"That Dam Guide\" for our tour!! Most especially, I'm so very glad that Rob was the one chosen to give us our tour of Amsterdam!! What a comprehensive, extensive, incredibly interesting introduction to a wonderful city!! Thank you Rob!!"

Shortly after arriving at our meeting point, The National Monument, we were approached by a kind young man named Benjamin. Benjamin was to be our guide. After brief introductions, we were given our loose itinerary and off we went! Benjamin had a deep knowledge and understanding of the city and it's history. His passion for Amsterdam was contagious and I found myself being immersed in this foreign city. As stated before, the plan was structured but loose. Benjamin had an idea how he wanted us to view Amsterdam but also wanted us to have the freedom to ask questions or step off the beaten path. A highlight for me was when I asked about jenever. He immediately took us through the winding streets and brought us to his favorite jenever bar. After showing me the proper way to enjoy the tasty spirit, we were back on track with the tour. When we finished the tour 3 hours later, Benjamin sat with us and highlighted many of the things we saw on a map. He stayed as we asked countless questions about the city he clearly loves. Benjamin was a genuinely kind, entertaining, and knowledgeable guide. I could not have thought of a better way to start our time in AMS. He introduced us to a city that I now love as well."

The concierge at our hotel suggested we book a private tour, however, we wanted something a little less expensive yet still intimate, so he told us to go on-line and check out That Dam Guide. We couldn't have made a better choice. My wife and I have traveled to over 60 countries throughout the world and we've taken many tours, some good, some bad. But, I must admit, I've never enjoyed myself or learned as much as I did, on the Amsterdam city tour I took with Rob. He's an incredible guide! As promised, the group was small; only 10 of us, and boy did we cover a lot. Rob made us feel right at home. It felt like he was just showing a group of friends around the city. What a fun way to explore Amsterdam as well as learn a little bit about city's history. I'll always remember my visit by the day I spent wandering the streets of Amsterdam with \"that dam guide\", Rob. A not to be missed experience. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

Just a nice, informative, well-paced walk all around central Amsterdam, with a group of 9 other people. He told us some history, some tips about the city, and glimpses into the politics and issues facing The Netherlands today.

I'm glad we did as Rob was a terrific guide, and we didn't visit just the typical sights in Amsterdam.

We learned a lot about the history and beginnings of this cosmopolitan city as well as interesting and unusual little tidbits of life in the city of today. We highly recommend this tour as a great starting point to understanding the city and to finding your way around.  This is a three hour walking tour along cobbled streets.

He was happy to go at the pace of the group and was more than happy to have anyone ask questions about landmarks throughout our tour. I learnt a lot about the city in short space of time and would recommend this tour to anyone planning on a short stay in Amsterdam as it gives you a good grasp of the city quickly. Best points of this tour are its small group sizes (4-8) we were lucky enough to have 4 and the passion from our guide.

Mark was great as he really has a unique perspective as he lived in the RLD for a time, above one of the establishments , and has known many of the people who work there and is familiar with their point of view. Mark is very casual and comfortable to be with. I just wished I had known about the trips into the countryside that he has now started.

City tour with Benjamin was a wonderful introduction to Amsterdam on my first day there. Benjamin is passionate about history and is able to engage every person on the tour with his sense of humor. He even gave us pointers about some of more specific sites we wanted to see. Lealu made the RLD tour a very informative and interesting experience. I feel like I gained a deeper understanding of the RLD and its workers. Mark and Rory completed my Amsterdam visit with the Country side tour. Two absolute charming tour guides, who made each one of us feel right at home. We met at a central train station and, after brief introductions, were taken on a shuttle through the beautiful countryside on a small van. We went into a non-touristy old town, where we had coffee, delicious home-made apple pie and some interesting facts about the town. We then proceeded onto seeing the Windmill, and had it pretty much all to ourselves to explore and to take photos. Finally, we finished the tour with the most unique cheese tasting at a farm! Mark and Rory never rushed us, and even extended our stay there when they saw that we were all fascinated by the daily proceedings of the Farm. Mark brought along his professional camera and even was kind enough to take some photos for us (since some of us quickly ran out of our own phone battery). All in all, I was extremely pleased with each of the tours, which were the highlight of the trip in themselves. If you are looking for a small-group tour that incorporates a wonderful balance between history and humor, I cannot recommend this team enough."

Mark taught me so much that was new and interesting, and much that was useful too. I was walking alone and thought I might find the group a bit daunting but with his charm and erudition, Mark warmed everyone up, and the groups are intentionally small enough for comfortable interaction. He skilfully combines anecdotes with refreshing social awareness and I learned with concern about the impact of gentrification on the people of Amsterdam and the things that have made it what it was. Particularly in the Red Light District the long struggle for sexworkers' rights is facing new threats. There were well-timed breaks in delightful spots where we could sample local delights. A year after the walks I am still reflecting, and writing this overdue review to reminisce."

She provided tons of interesting and fun information on both tours. The pace of the walking tour was nice, not too fast, not too slow. It's great that the tours are kept to a maximum of 10 people, it is more personal and engaging. Lealu also took the time to offer suggestions and mark restaurants (and the walk route) on a map for everyone and even sent a follow up email with more information. She had a good sense of humor and you can tell she really loves what she does. Would recommend to anyone who wants to learn and have a good time!"

            "review": "The highlight of our trip to Amsterdam. First of all I want to thank previous reviewers of this tour because that is the reason why we chose it. We booked a Sunday morning walking tour of the city with Rob. He was there on time with his orange pom pom which was easy to spot! There were supposed to be ten of us but I believe one didn't show. Rob did an excellent job at the beginning with a 7 minute introduction to the history of Amsterdam. He spoke very clearly and his English is perfect. We walked through several areas beginning with the outskirts of the Red Light district. He explained things you have to watch out for as a tourist as well as getting deeper into the history of the city and its population. About two hours into the tour he took us to a little cafe inside a clothing store which was a nice surprise. It was a bit chilly outside so it was nice to sit down and warm up. I won't give away all the surprises but suffice it to say this tour has been well thought out and Rob did a great job with the delivery. The next day we had already signed up for a bus tour of the city and were extremely disappointed with it compared to this. I suggest booking this tour at the beginning of your stay as it will help you learn where everything is and develop a strategy for what you see and in what order. We thought so highly of it that we even gave another tourist Rob's card while eating lunch on a day tour to Volendam. I'm sure that tour operator wasn't happy about that but I am a firm believer in giving credit when it is due! What are you waiting for? Book this tour already!!!"

WRONG! Thanks to Mark, it was not only interesting but fun and delightful with stories and side notes delivered with humor and genuine knowledge of this city and its history. We saw more in the three hours than we could have ever accomplished on our own. The affection that Mark has for Amsterdam came through in his charming presentation ... the time just flew by. We used several of his tips later to continue exploring on our own. I highly recommend this tour for a great introduction to Amsterdam."

I booked on the 3 hour city tour as I had time to kill before I met up with my Dutch friends later on and I must say even though it rained all day in Amsterdam, it certainly didn't dampen our wonderful guide Lealu's spirit and sense of humour! She was incredibly knowledgeable about the area, was full of interesting and witty stories and followed up with an email with references she had made in the tour which was very helpful. We stopped off at a cafe and had delicious hot chocolate which was lovely as we all got to know each other in the small group. Lealu is a warm, friendly, fun lady who is a fantastic tour guide and I would highly recommend this tour...in fact I even recommended it to my dutch friends!Ps: Lealu, I ate at that pancake house you recommended and went for the apple and bacon.

Rob is American, but living in Amsterdam for more than a decade. He had good information about Amsterdam and hit most of the highlights. There was a nearly 40 minute stop in the middle of the tour at a small caf\u00e9, which seemed unnecessary. If I wanted to go for coffee, I could have done that myself, but to take 40 minutes of a three hour tour for a coffee break seemed excessive. The only good point was that it was cold outside, so it was at least an opportunity to warm up. Overall it is a good small group tour at a reasonable price, but perhaps grab a coffee to go!"

There were 4 of us and 6 other people on the Tour which was excellent as it meant everybody heard everything Rob said and he engaged with us all. Other Tours just have too many people on them! The Tour was both interesting and enjoyable with Rob's knowledge, detail and fun! He also took us to a delightful, tucked away little Cafe for afternoon tea mid-way through the Tour which we would never have found on our own. Re-fuelled by gorgeous cake, scones and cream and tea, onwards we went and we were sorry when it all concluded at 5.30pm, the time just flew by:-( If you want to learn about Amsterdam's history, current day circumstances and have fun, don't go on any other Tour than this one, Rob is fantastic and the Tour comprehensive in its nature. If you take this Tour at the beginning of your visit to Amsterdam it will help you to decide what else you may wish to visit in detail etc., and use your time wisely. Thanks Rob, you are an absolute gentleman and an exemplary Tour Guide - we wish you every success in your primary role as a Composer - you are an awesome talent!"

I was very lucky to have 2 guides, Mark and Rory. They are smart, funny and had a nice itinerary. The group was small, friendly and fun. We met at Amsterdam Centraal and left the crowds and bustle of Amsterdam for a peaceful day in the country. We first visited Monnickendam, a picturesque fishing village where we strolled the waterfront and quaint streets, stopping for a coffee. Next, we traveled to see a set of windmills. We got up close looks at the mechanics of pumping water using the windmill. We also had opportunities for fabulous photos of canals, windmills and fields of tulips. Mark and Rory are quite knowledgeable and were able to explain the complex canal system used to move water and keep places dry. The highlight of the day was the wine and cheese tasting. We tried several different Beemster cheeses then visited the Beemster factory for another taste and opportunity to buy cheese. We got back mid afternoon and I would do this tour again in a heartbeat. Beautiful views, a great and funny host, and wine and cheese? What could be better? I highly recommend the Country side tour with \"That Dam Guide\""

So...We have taken to finding a walking tour on our first jet lagged day in a new city (partly to keep us up, partly to get a 'lay of the land', partly to stay out of the pubs until dark- haha). Leeluu and the That Dam Guide fit the bill Perfectly! She knew enough to give an informative and fun tour, and to answer ALL questions. The groups are small enough that you get time to ask questions about whatever you may be interested in, and Leelu helped each member of the tour with info to make their stay in Amsterdam what they were looking for. One couple wanted to go clubbing, another interested in history etc. At our coffee break, we all sat down and she gave us each a city map, and pointed out things/places that we might be interested in (clubs, brew-pubs,history sites etc). Most were not on the official map, so she wrote them in - perfect! She also gave us all hints on local do's and dont's and how best to get about, again - Perfect!!NOT expensive, NOT a big Group, NOT too long (about 3 hrs). Again PERFECT for an intro to a new city!"

We wanted to learn about the history of the city as well as drinking and partying and so I booked a custom tour a few weeks in advance of our trip. I booked the tour through Mark who was extremely helpful in advising me with what type of tour I should book, how much it would cost and all other details. He sent me pictures of Lealu, who would be our guide and pictures of the National Monument where we would meet her. As none of the group had ever been to the city before this was massively helpful on the day as we were able to find the monument and Lealu, with ease. On the day our bus from the ferry into Amsterdam was late, making our half ten start time for the tour impossible to make. Mark had provided me with Lealu's phone number and therefore we were able to text her to arrange a later time to meet. Lealu was so helpful with this and didn't mind that we pushed the tour back at all. She was so friendly and kind and we all felt very comfortable with her. We had a 2 and a half hour tour round Amsterdam with Lealu and it was interesting and insightful from the word go. There is so much to learn about the city and Lealu knew so much. She answered all our questions and kept us interested for the duration of the tour. We all agreed that although tours like this can sometimes become boring, Lealu's fun and approachable attitude made the two and a half hours fly in and kept the content exciting and fun to learn about. We visited the red light district and obvious attractions but also the outskirts of the city, hidden places that we would have had no clue were there if we hadn't been with a guide. Lealu was not only helpful during the tour, but also advised us where to eat out during our stay, where to go for cocktails and where the places to go for a night out are. We had booked another activity directly after our tour but had no idea how to get to it so Lealu even had the good grace to walk us right to its door step. We would never have found it without her! I cannot fault the service we were provided or the experience of the tour from start to finish. I even received a follow up email from Lealu, making sure we had enjoyed the tour and providing me with information on books I could read and documentaries I could watch related to the content of the tour. Lealu and the team are amazing at their jobs and I cannot recommend this activity enough. If you want to see the city of Amsterdam and learn about it's culture and history then this is the tour for you. A must do for any visit! :) Alex and the hens, Carlisle"

I've done the canal boat tour and this walking tour is a hundred times better than those audio tape guides. The pace was leisurely and Ben accommodated our request for a small detour to the Flower market where we stopped to buy some bulbs. Thanks, Ben! Keep up the passionate storytelling!"

The route/path was good to see the things you would expect to see in the city center.- Guide was very enthusiastic about the city. It made it nice. It was like he wanted us to love the place like he does.Cons:- Our locations were confusing. As we walked, we saw some interesting areas/site, but had no reference where we were. For example, we had some good fries, but had no idea how to get back there. It would be really nice for the guide to show you where you were on a map. If nothing else, just tell you which way is north. - Red Light District. Definitely not a \u201ccon,\u201d but the classic openness/tolerance of Amsterdam is apparent and may not be appropriate for some conservative people (and children). Recommendations:- Follow the tour on a map so you know how to revisit sites."

Lealu was a great tour guide, with vast knowledge of the sex workers and other interesting features of the RLD. We got to learn about many sides of the RLD, including history, alternative types of 'window', the coffeeshop phenomenon and types of entertainment around the district. Lealu did not rush the tour; there were many opportunities to ask questions and time to take in what we were looking at(!) We took this tour on the second night of our trip, but I'd actually recommend it for the first night if you can, because then you will have the rest of your stay to return to the RLD and experience some of the things Lealu talks about, like the popular restaurants, bars and shows. It was very different to how I imagined, but in a good way, and I would recommend to anyone wanting to find out more about the RLD than meets the eye."

The tour covered a lot of ground in a relatively short period of time, and it was extremely personalized - Ben made sure he knew our interests in the first few minutes and catered his overview to those. I also loved the small group aspect of the tour - we were only five people, and I believe the tours are limited to ten - so we were able to go off the beaten path to a certain degree.

Though we had visited Amsterdam twice before, his tour and insight provided new information and perspectives. Got to see some sections of the city, we'd never find -- and learned lots in the 3 hour tour. We've taken scores of walking tours around the world -- often you get what you pay for -- the free tours are not focused and often times lead you to shops or restaurants where the guide is obviously getting some sort of consideration. Not so with That Dam Guide. Small groups ensure an opportunity to hear everything and get some excellent restaurant sight-seeing tips. The company is looking into the possibility of day tours out of Amsterdam. Would really be interested in that, when we return. Tip: Take this tour on your first day -- it's an excellent way to get your bearings in the city."

My wife and I spent three days in Amsterdam and took advantage of the City Tour and Red Light District Tour. Mark and Ben were both great guides and the group size from 4, on the first, to 10 on the second tour, really made the walks enjoyable and low-key. Humor, knowledge of local history and willingness to make recommendations for good activities before/after the tours were tremendously helpful. Ben's conversational nature of guiding was decidedly a highlight. Mark's personal relationships with the sex workers and ability to help transcend stereotypes and biases make the Red Light District Tour a can't miss. You'll have to go on the tour to find out more about the 6 minutes. FYI - a walk around Amsterdam in March can be pretty chilly...dress warm!"

We walked around for the 3 hours, except for a stop to get an amazing hot chocolate! Lealu is very knowledgable and told me many facts and details about the history of Amsterdam. Her way of explaining things made it very interesting, and it is evident in her passion and all the quirky/special details she shared that she loves Amsterdam. I learned so much about the city that I felt like an expert. The next week I met some coworkers in another city in Netherlands and I found myself repeating time after time, \"But you know, my tour guide told me .....so and so...\" :-) Lealu also gave me information on interesting places to go, I tried two of the restaurants that she recommended and they were excellent. Lealu was so nice, she treated me with great respect, took my pictures, waited for me, answered all my questions. I felt like I was walking around with a good friend. Thanks Lealu! You are awesome and I had a great time!If you want to get to know Amsterdam better and enjoy the secrets and history of the city do this tour.

Both were brilliant. He was interesting - obviously genuinely loves the city and knows the history with a passion. He was entertaining - adding anecdotes and stories that brought smiles to our faces. He was generous - not only with his knowledge, but even provided a \"P-mate\" for the ladies (a disposable tool which enables us females to pee standing up! Something very useful if using the public loos). Also, Mark refuses to accept commission - this is different to a lot of the Amsterdam guides, and a comforting thought. He showed us interesting shops and caf\u00e9s and gave honest and local advice. The Red Light District tour was particularly eye-opening and Mark provided some exceptional insider facts! To add to this, after your trip, he sends very interesting stuff by email. The tours are reasonably priced and Mark restricts the number for each tour, to ensure it is manageable and not over-crowded. Yes, we definitely recommend him if you want to tour the wonderful city of Amsterdam. Book him as soon as you can - he is obviously very popular."

Had the tour on the 28th of January with Rob who is a great guy who know the history of Amsterdam quit well and we got to enjoy a break at this great authentic cafe. The tour lasts for around 3 hours in which you will enjoy some beautiful scenery and hear about the history of Amsterdam. It is fun, entertaining and easy going. I was quite lucky as i was the only one on the tour :D so i got a private tour for the price of a normal one."

We did his walking tour of the Red Light district and it was amazing. Our tour group was just our group of six friends(not some giant group of tourists being herded about). We were able to walk around at our own pace and talk with Mark and get all his cool little tidbits about the district and its history. The next day we met back up with Mark and took a customized walking tour of the city center. A little history, a little culture, a little of the odd facts/trivia and we were able to just enjoy the sights and get recommendations from him about what to do and where to go for the rest of our stay. Mark was knowledgable, friendly, and helpful. I highly recommend him and his 'That Dam Guide' group. I was a great introduction to Amsterdam."

There are several things I look for in a tour: (1) communication, (2) flexibility, (3) professionalism, (4) knowledge, (5) personability, and (6) humor. Mark clearly communicated everything I needed to know about the tour in advance of the tour -- I knew exactly what to expect, where to go, and who to look for. On the day of the tour, Mark contacted me to see if I would be interested in rescheduling the tour because it was bitter cold, raining, and I was the only person who had signed up for the RLD tour that evening. He offered several alternatives, but unfortunately the alternatives didn't work for me. That didn't phase Mark, and he demonstrated his professionalism and commitment because he still gladly met up with me to give me a private RLD tour that night. Although the tour was only scheduled for two hours, we spent nearly three hours exploring the RLD during which he shared his knowledge on the RLD's history, current politics, and local restaurants/bars. And he did so in truly engaging, entertaining way. Almost three hours later, we finished the tour only because I was tired. Over the next few days, I checked out several of the restaurants and bars that Mark recommended -- they were all awesome, and, because of Mark's connections, I even got discounts at several places!"

Rob was a great guide and was very knowledgeable about the city. I think the only way to see the RLD is in a small group with a guide. If I had not done this tour, I would have left Amsterdam having missed an opportunity to really see the area and hear about the politics and human side of the district. Both groups were just the right size at about 10 people and were really fun."

He makes a point of it not being like that.

Mark's tour of Amsterdam was the best walking tour out of several that we booked in Europe's largest cities during a trip where we spent several days in London, Paris and Amsterdam. Extremely well organized, very good communications during the booking and right up to the start of the tour.We particularly appreciated Mark's ability to provide an entertaining but deeply insightful overview to understand the city and its context of history, geography and other forces that shaped it to be what we see today. In contrast to other tours, Mark's intelligence and wit and \"big picture\" approach really impressed us --- like attending a graduate seminar with a college professor who knows how to both entertain and educate. He was also full of fun \"hip\" information that we enjoyed learning - everything from bicycle culture, to Dutch swearing, the monarchy, and how the city has taken unique directions in handling everything from squatters, to junkies, as well as cannabis and the sex trade.As a result, both of us (15 year old high schooler and 55 year old engineer/dad) equally enjoyed the time. Appreciated also the hard cap of 10 people per tour which made the group manageable and allowed us to have an individualized experience at a very reasonable cost.Highest recommendation - top tour out of about 10 we have done this year in travelling through Paris/London and Amsterdam. We picked the best walking tours throughout based on tripadvisor reviews, but this was much, much better than the rest.."

We managed to get over there the following day but the RLD tour wasn't on.Mark was super helpful and rearranged for us to go on the city tour with Lealu. We had already missed a full day of our short stay so we were panicking a little. We didn't know what to do or see or how to make the most of our stay! We are blessed that we ended up on this tour as it really was a fabulous guide for the rest of our holiday.Lealu is really friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, kind and generally a wonderful person to have in your company. We only had a few in our tour compared to others we came across, who had over 50 people!! How could you even hear what their tour guides were saying?! We were able to ask lots of questions about the best restaurants, the best sex show to go to, the best coffee shops etc. Lealu got us a map and penciled all these in for us. She also recommended a gorgeous little local Christmas market which was only 20 minutes from us, on that very day. So although we missed the previous day due to bad luck, we felt like she helped us to jam pack our few days with very specific activities which we might never have found.She also brought us through the Red light District and gave us some history on that which we appreciated seeing as that was our original choice of tour.We got a very thorough understanding of what makes the local people who they are. The history is fascinating. We really loved learning about the people and the culture and it set up the rest of the holiday as we now had some knowledge to help us appreciate everything we saw next. She helped us choose what to do with our time and she really did make our holiday because we had the confidence afterwards to navigate the city and go straight to the best bits (for our needs).It was December, and I was wearing flimsy leggings. Please dress up warm! Lealu, bless her, brought us to a little shop selling cheap scarves, gloves and hats, at which one of our group bought some warm clothing. The weather obviously wasn't her fault but it was a little distracting which was my own mistake. We didn't feel the cold until towards the end so it didn't make too much of a difference.Thank you Lealu, we will be back with you for the Red Light District tour for sure :-)-Sandy and Mark"

Our tour guide was Rob, very enthusiastic about all aspects of Amsterdam including history, culture, modernism etc and was an absolute joy to spend the 3 hours with. The time flies by and there is never a point where it feels like it's dragging (which to be honest I was expecting when I heard it was 3 hours long, so I was pleasantly surprised!) We saw other tour groups walking around the same areas as us which had upwards of 20/30 people - our group only had 6 which meant we could move around a lot easier, everyone was able to hear what Rob was saying and we had the opportunity to chat and ask questions, all of which I imagine would be much more difficult in the larger groups. I would definitely recommend this tour to friends and family and if I'm ever back in Amsterdam I will be doing their RLD tour.Thanks for a great tour!"

The tour was three hours long but was regularly punctuated with mini stops along the way to look at interesting places and items that represent Amsterdam. It was a great way to get to know the city and learn about its history. Thoroughly recommended."

Booking online was easily done when booked we received an email with directions and even a picture of the meeting point.There were only 8 In our group and Rob made effort to talk to each one of us along the way. Something that could not have been done if we had joined a large group. Rob was friendly, funny and full of knowledge. We were never rushed walking around it was a very easy walk and we didn't feel bombarded by information it was more like a conversation with interesting facts. Would recommend it to everyone you don't need to be very interested in history to do these tours it is not like a lecture but a lot of interesting facts while seeing a beautiful city."

He entertained us with tales - both humorous and serious- along the way, and the 3Hrs passed very quickly. Also worth mentioning is that we had a need to make a fairly last minute change to our tour, due to flight delays, and Mark (the owner) was able to accommodate our request - thank you for this!"

While the free tour guides themselves can be good, think about what you are getting (if it's a huge crowd, will you hear?) and how they make money (they have to make money, of course). If you want a great tour, get a good company with a good guide.Mark with That Dam Guide was excellent. He was an informative and entertaining, and really knows both the old and recent history of Amsterdam. The trip is well worth the money. (And even though he doesn't use the \"hidden commission\" way of making money, he gives you a card that you can show to various stores and get a nice discount.)"

We learned so much in both sessions and got to travel the city as if we lived there. Lealu and Benjamin know their history very well and provided us with plenty of tips regarding where to eat, visit, see, explore. The groups were very small and both guides allowed us to take our time and ask plenty of questions.Do not go on those guides that have 20 to 30 people.... specially when visiting the RLD. We had a very small group and we blended in to the crowd as if we belong there.I have to once again thank our great guides for the wonderful time we had. I highly recommend these two tours. Mark the owner was also great following up with us and providing great links for things to do. Thank you."

He was an absolutely excellent guide with a fascinating back story on his experience in Amsterdam. We learned so much about the politics and history of the Red Light District. Mark talked about what it's like for the workers in the area and the changes the city has gone through. He pointed out the various points of interest, shared some hilarious and inappropriate stories, and kept the drunken stag parties away from us. This is the only way to see the Red Light District and keep it classy but still on point! Highly recommend to everyone who wants to learn about the real stories of the district without being overly explicit. Still, definitely not a family-friendly tour simply due to the nature of the area."

Mark lists not only the dates and times of each tour but also the title of the tour, the name of the tour guide, and how many spots are available for each. It's up to you to choose, and it's easy! It's obvious Mark is a professional tour guide, and his operation reflects that.The tour itself is very informal. Mark is casual and lots of fun. He expertly guided us around much of the central area, giving out tips and advice for further exploration of Amsterdam. Although Mark has done these tours many, many times, we had the feeling that each tour is a fresh experience for him. We've been with guides who seem to have memorized their spiel and just recite what seems like a script by rote. We never got that feeling with Mark.Sign up for this, go take a walk, and enjoy!"

The group was small (10 ppl) and our guide Lealu super friendly, professional and interesting. We did the morning tour of central Amsterdam and loved every corner and every story that came with it. Great experience, thank you Lealu. Hope to come again and see more of your glorious city! Ciao"

One of the great irritants of a large tour is hanging around waiting for everyone to catch up and with such small groups that doesn't happen. We could take small alleyways which would be off limits to larger groups and Mark didn't need to bellow to make himself heard.Needless to say, the commentary was excellent, well balanced between old & modern as well as personal experience & reflection. I also liked the fact that whilst Mark has negotiated some discounts for his clients with selected shops, he does not push you into them and expect you to buy."

I am SO glad that I booked a tour with him because not only is he funny, he knows his stuff. It's not just a \"here's the red light district, blah, blah\" tour...instead he goes into a historical detail and helps you appreciate and fall in love with this amazing city built on canals without even knowing it. I cannot say anything bad about this amazing tour. We were able to cover all of Amsterdam during our 3-4 hour tour, take plenty of pictures, ask questions, take breaks and stopped into many cafes for some drinks and fuel while heading to our next destination. Mark is amazing and he will answer any questions that you have and even help with directions once the tour is over (since it ends in a different district).I recommend booking his tour in the beginning of your stay in Amsterdam so you can get a brief feel of the history and neighborhoods before it's too late.

Try to plan for first day of your visit. 10 ppl per tour is awesome, we could hear everything said and got to meet & enjoy the other ppl in the tour also who were lovely. We would all say as we passed big groups that we were so glad we weren't with them. Good on you Mark, Gill and I wish you the best :)"

Benjamin gave our group of 10 a high-octane introduction at each stop, then followed up as we walked with full and patient answers to all our questions. He adapted to our interests and nothing was glossed over or dismissed. Others advise booking this tour for your first day in Amsterdam. It was my third day and just as good - I had a bit of knowledge and many more questions than if I'd just arrived. Walking around the next day I saw bored walking groups of 20 or more and was delighted and a bit smug that we'd had such a great experience. Totally recommended."

Hi - Based on TripAdvisor reviews I signed up for 2 walking tours - The Red Light District which was guided by Lealu and the history of Amsterdam tour guided by Mark.They have such knowledge and passion for the city and the history. Much respect for the people, the past, present and future.Of course their personalities is really what makes the tours spectacular. I was in Amsterdam and this was a great way to learn and see so much in such a short time of such a fabulous city! So great to know the stories behind so much.Another most desirable factor is that it is just a group of up to 10 people which makes it intimate and easy to stay as a group and get to know one another. Added bonus. :)Thank you Lealu and Mark for most memorable times!"

This is a plus as you are not fighting to try and hear the guide compared to other groups that we saw with 20+ people. Lealu was a great and fun guide and answered all the questions asked with great humour. We didn't realise how much there was to the The Red Light District so don't be put off by the two hour length, it's really interesting and fun. It sells out a lot in advance so I would advise booking well in advance. "

Found That Dam Guide through TA, but their group city tour was booked on our available days. Instead, I was able to book Benjamin as a private guide for our family of four (we are traveling with two adult daughters 22 & 24) and we all enjoyed the tour immensely. Benjamin was funny and very interesting. We all appreciated the rich history (without being boring), antidotes and backstories he provided. He has a true love of Amsterdam and it's people, and that shined though on this tour. Also, Benjamin, thanks for the tip on Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs - We ate the most delicious pancakes there the next afternoon!"

We bought our tickets ahead of time on line. The only problem we had was that the tour ended in a different place and we had to get back to the train station. Mark was very helpful however in giving us directions back to the train station. One of the best walking tours I have done. Would highly recommend."

Tip 1 - book early for your first full day in town great way to find you're way about. This did not detract from the tour although we knew our way about the main areas by the time we took this. Rob took us to so many different streets and places so it was great to see other parts of the city. Rob was very friendly and informative (one of the best guides we have had and we have done many city tours). Our group was small (10 people) so it was easy to move around. Rob provided a tremendous history of Amsterdam as well as the lay out of the city from medieval times to present. Tip 2 - have a good Breakfast as its 3 hours and the lunch stop is only a short coffee and muffin snack. Thoroughly recommend this Tour and Rob."

It is a fascinating place with a colorful history.Whilst on our tour we passed a few other walking tours which must have had around 30 people in the groups which reinforced the fact that we had booked the best Dam tour in the city :)I can\u2019t speak highly enough about how much my wife and I enjoyed this tour and Lealu\u2019s company for the 2 or so hours we explored the many alleys and streets of Amsterdam\u2019s Red Light District.10/10"

I had been in Amsterdam for 2 days Prior to going on this walking tour, and my best advice is book it quickly before it's sold out and plan the first afternoon for it. The history and sense of humor from our tour guide Benjamin was just as fun as seeing the sights. He even went out of his way to let us stop when and where we wanted with a nice little surprise half way through for a mint tea and sit. I had gone shopping a bit just prior to the tour (not a good idea, btw, unless you're close to your hotel and can drop them off) and my bags started to rip at the handle about half way through the tour. Benjamin saved the day, grabbing a couple plastic ones that were able to combine my things and make carrying them so much easier! Thanks for an awesome time and a wonderful guide.

However, if you are intrigued by what has made the Red Light District tick all these years and learn about the life and even the motivation of the prostitutes who pose in the windows, then you are cheating yourself if you go to Amsterdam and don't take this tour. I have never taken a tour before...I've always scoffed at the hoards of tourists following a tour guide holding a plastic flower above the crowd. I figured I could always pick up a book, google a question and learn on my own. But the kind of info Mark can share with you is one of a kind. Many others have gone into detail about Mark and the info he can share and they're all correct. I enjoyed his tour because he was able to share some intense and sometimes shocking information with a light touch and a sense of humor that made us all relax and enjoy the stories without judgement. The respect and admiration Mark has for the RLD and the women who work there shines through. My bf and I came out of the experience feeling much richer with information and appreciation for a unique neighborhood. I can say in this instance, it was well worth paying for the tour. Heck, you might even get a \"door prize\". I did! Thanks to you, Mark, for taking us thru the RDL on a terribly rainy Friday night in early September!

We met the small group of 11 at the appointed time and began a walking tour of old town Amsterdam. Mark was a wealth of information on the history of Amsterdam, current culture, and the mindset of the people. We walked the red light district, the old town, and learned about the canals, the people, the monarchy and the culture of Amsterdam. He answered any questions and pointed us in the right direction for cafes, bars, coffee shops, or restaurants. Excellent job. Well worth the price."

I think with a topic such as this, that the guide having a real insider knowledge about the topic really makes a difference, as opposed to a tour guide who is sensationalizing everything just to shock the customers. Mark is passionate about what he does, and that's because he knows the workers well. He lived near them for a long time and continues to interview them. They know him. So he talks about the topic with a passion that is very genuine, but also with a lot of caring for the workers themselves. It would be easy to dismiss them all as \"whores\" or assume they're all being held against their will since many would like to believe not many women would want to do this for work, but that would be incorrect. Mark's deep knowledge and sense of humor makes this a well spent two hours."

I really have a broader view of the situation of the openness of prostitution in Amsterdam. if I had just walked around with my husband, I would not have understood and would have felt the dehumanizing effect without understanding why the women choose to be sitting in windows here. he has done his research and talked to many women in this situation and is able to tell their stories. the next day we went on the city tour with Mark and enjoyed his stories of the coffee shops and the fascinating history of this city. He also gave us recommendations of places to go and gave us all the websites for further reading. Start your trip with Mark. Amsterdam is a confusing city to walk around in and you will get a local's perspective from an articulate and funny person who will feel like a friend in less than 10 minutes. Wear good walking shoes for the cobble stones. The walk was not strenuous and we stopped for a break midway through."

I am a tour guide myself, and I have a very high standard for guides, and Mark certainly exceeded that standard! He limits his groups to 10 people, which makes a huge difference, especially in the small alleys of Amsterdam. Unfortunately, it was raining during our tour, but he kept our attention until the very end. He offered us ponchos, introduced himself, gave a historical background, and then we were off. He struck the perfect tone of history, practical information, and what the city is like today. In the evening, luckily the rain had stopped, and we went on his evening tour, which is where he really shined. His friendships with some of the women who work in the Red Light District allowed us to see what goes on behind the scenes, and how the industry really works. It was fun, but also truly educational, and we left with a much deeper understanding of the sex work in Amsterdam. Our only regret was that we could not spend more time with Mark. Book Mark right away! He and his guides are the only way to see Amsterdam!"

Seeing the number of positive reviews for (owner and founder) Mark, I was initially hesitant to select a different guide when his tour times were booked. I'm so glad we went ahead and booked a tour by Lealu, who is a resident of the Red Light District and brought a great personal touch to the information she relayed. I highly recommend both Lealu and the RLD tour, which was well-structured and covered a large array of topics.Lealu provided great information both about the history of the district as well as what actually \"goes on\" in the brothels and the various types of sex shows. She spoke about sex practices in a very relaxed and matter-of-fact manner that seemed to put everyone in our diverse group at ease, and made us feel free to ask whatever detailed questions were on our minds. Lealu has a playful sense of humor but at the same time was immensely respectful, both of the women whose work she was discussing as well as the individuals on the tour. She kept the perspective(s) of the sex workers front and center in the stories she recounted, which is not something that is easily gleaned from reading about the RLD in books and on the internet.Choosing the 7:00 pm tour time on a Saturday night was another happy accident. At this time of year, it meant that our 2-hour(plus) tour began in broad daylight, extended through twilight, and ended in the nighttime, and the constantly changing light highlighted different aspects of the surrounding architecture. Even more interesting to me was getting to observe the functional transition in the neighborhood throughout the tour as the prime hours for sex work began to approach. Walking around with the group in the beginning felt like sightseeing in almost any other tourist-y section of Amsterdam, albeit with sex-themed shops and signs in greater abundance, but very little going on in the windows. As the tour progressed, we began to see a steady stream of women arriving to begin their evening shifts in the windows. For me, watching the women arrive in their street clothes, smiling and chit-chatting with their neighbors as they crossed the thresholds into their rooms, was one of the most interesting and unexpectedly compelling aspects of the tour. By the end of the evening, the vast majority of the windows were occupied and the women (literally) geared up for business. In short, the tour was both educational and fun. The phenomenon of sex work is a complicated topic that cannot itself be adequately covered during a single tour, but Lealu's discussion of its practice in the RLD will make me think about it in new ways going forward."

Mark is a long-time resident of the city, who escorted our small group of ten people for three plus hours of exploration in the city. Our tour started near the old Stock Exchange, led through some of the oldest parts of the city, passed through the red light district, and then crossed over to the other side of the central Dam to explore the 'middle class' and 'working class' neighborhoods built in the 1700's. Mark has a wealth of information on the city, its history, and for those interested, how things work today. We had a couple of folks interested in how coffee shops work, and there was more than one question about the red light district. Mark is a pleasant and intelligent man, who can tell an excellent story while leading his groups through the streets. After the tour, he made himself available for more questions, provided advice about other tours (especially the canal boat tours), and about the best places to visit, eat, and avoid.I recommend this tour for any adult, and for kids who are worldly enough to handle the red light and coffee shop stories. Nothing is X- (or even R-) rated, but the content is necessary in order to understand this extremely liberal city."

Secondly, Mark is passionate about the city and his subject which helped me relate to the socio-economic issues of the city.

Our walking tour took in many aspects of Amsterdam The Red Light District,the Main Sights and the Historical. Rob explained how Amsterdam has been slowly built and is continuing to be built. He explained about the buildings and the canals. He was really fun and gave us the lighter side as well as the serious. Rob answered all our questions and had a lot of knowledge..I would highly recommend this tour for any visitors to Amsterdam. It was both fun and informative."

After doing the tour I can say this was without a doubt the best tour we did during our whole 2 weeks in Europe. I did not really know what to expect from a red light district tour but this was the perfect combination of humor and information. Mark is so well informed on this area. He also takes smaller groups so you can ask questions and not get lost in the crowd. I saw other tour groups in the area while we were there and from just a brief observation I could tell it was no where near as good as Mark's tour. My friends that took the tour with me had nothing but good things to say. He has a deep respect for this area and women that work here. Even if you do not necessarily agree with the red light district I would recommend this tour to educate yourself."

He included interesting information on the history of the RLD, and various related political issues, keeping things light and amusing with his own brand of humour and little anecdotes and stories. His tour is very well researched and we felt we were getting the facts. We are only sorry that the city tour offered by the same organisation was sold out for the duration of our stay. Highly recommended."

Mark limits his groups to 10 people, which ensures that you can hear what he's saying and lets him tailor his stories to each group. The stories are historical and cultural in content, and pretty hilarious too. I especially liked that he tailored his stories to relate to us. He also has lots of helpful recommendations about restaurants, cafes (with coffee), coffee shops (with more than coffee if you know what I mean), and anything else you might visit Amsterdam for. Obviously, if you're visiting Amsterdam don't expect everything to be PG, including this tour :) Have fun!"

Having a week-long trip, my family decided a guided tour on our first full day in Amsterdam would be the best way to get our bearings, and we got far more than we bargained for! We met Benjamin in Dam Square in the morning and he guided us through the city while giving us one of the best history lessons I've ever experienced in such a short period of time. He is SO full of knowledge and has a such a wonderfully charming disposition that it felt as if we were just going for a stroll with an old friend. The tour was incredibly comprehensive and at the end of it I found myself more comfortable roaming around and exploring on my own. From The Jordaan District through the 9 Streets, Dam Square, the VOC and the Red Light District, Benjamin will tell you the background of all of it and you can tell that he truly enjoys sharing his abundance of knowledge. If you're taking a trip to Amsterdam and you want a great way to get to know the city, Benjamin is your guy!"

He also has a clear view of how the Dutch have influenced the world over the centuries, but was able to present his tour in a way that non-history buffs could enjoy as well. He also shared the best of Dutch food with us and gave us opportunities to purchase edibles along the way. THE BEST DAY OF OUR TRIP."

First night in Amsterdam (8th August) and we're off on a tour of the RLD with Lealu.There's a pretty eclectic mix of people & nationalities in the group, as we head off to the first place of interest. From start to finish this tour does not disappoint! It's eye opening, it may perhaps blow out the water some of your preconceptions or supposed myths. Lealu was incredibly knowledgeable and therefore informative. She was occasionally a little mischievous and all the way through very witty (which we certainly enjoyed!)The RLD is a contradiction of many kinds and all the more fascinating because of that! We saw numerous other tours of upwards of 25 people, with a tour organised by That Dam Guide you'll be part of a group of 10, which was absolutely perfect! Having read several other reviews it's very clear that all the guides actually connect with the place, Lealu actually mentioned that one of the people that is involved in a show in the RLD also attends her yoga class!Hopefully I'll return to Amsterdam in the future and will not hesitate in booking one of their other tours!Highly recommended!!"

He had great tips for those intrested in pursuing the windows ;) but he also made sure to throw in enough information about the politics and economics behind the scenes. A solid 360* when it comes to the RLD Tour.Also: During our stay Mark was fully booked up for the next few weeks(rightfully so) and so I had emailed him asking to please let me know if any spots open up. Thankfully a couple days later I received an email from Mark saying that there was two openings for the next day. Great communicator, and hella glad we were able to take this tour."

To be honest, what sold me on That Dam Guide was the website associated with the tours that includes many recommendations for where to eat, drink and other things (check it out!). The small size of the group impressed me, only about 12 people in total. This allowed for a much more personal experience, giving Mark lots of opportunity to answer individual questions. We hit all of the highlights, like Dam Square and the Red Light District, but I really did feel like we got a proper overview of some of the relevant history of the city, where to go and what to see. The 20 euros is worth it not to have to battle with a sea of other tourists in one of the \"free city walking tours\" that are everywhere. Thanks for a great introduction to Amsterdam Mark!"

Mark is an awesome and dynamic guide who incorporates history, fun stories and local flare throughout his tour. The RLD tour was absolutely fascinating, especially given Mark's personal history with the area. Mark provided lots of factual and practical information which proved to be very helpful especially if you wanted to take advantage of some of the fun things the district has to offer later at night. The next day's City tour provided a much broader overview of the city and its history. With fun anecdotes woven throughout, I'm so glad that we opted to sign up for both tours (especially as there was very minimal overlap between the two). Mark truly provides the full experience and I relied heavily on his website and, specifically, food recommendations. My husband joked, \"You only frequent the places Mark suggests, don't you?\" But it's so true! They were all excellent (Cote Ouest before our RLD tour - we actually bumped into Mark there as well!, the rijstaffel at Restaurant Max was one of the best meals we've ever had, the Pancake Bakery, Da Portate Via for pizza, Winkel 43 for apple tart, sugar 'N ice for waffles and cheese tasting at Reypenaer).It is apparent that Mark wants every single person on his tour to experience Amsterdam to its fullest and he truly tries to facilitate that as much as he can!

This tour isn't a tour simply for those who love sex and drugs in a tacky wrapping, but is also interesting for those who want know more about what Red Light is about."

We loved both tours.Mark is a historian, and we loved hearing about the history of Amsterdam and learning more about the city. He limits the tour to only 10 people, so there is plenty of time for questions, private conversations with him, etc.The Red Light Tour was of particular intrigue for us. We have never seen anything like the Red Light district, and wanted to better understand how it worked, the background of the women, the culture, etc. Mark has actually interviewed different women in the red light district and was able to give us real stories during the tour.I highly recommend both tours!"

You will not be disappointed with \"That Dam Guide\" and Mark himself.The tour, ours being a Red Light District Tour, was more intimate (pardon the pun).Mark provided unique insight into the sex industry in Amsterdam. His views, information, and stories about the RLD, brothels, and prostitution, were eye opening, entertaining, and made you feel something about the area.We left with many questions beyond the very in depth look Mark gave us to the area, and luckily, Mark invited us to a local microbrew after where we were able to get the answers to all of our wonderings.It was an intimate experience all around. Don't choose a larger \"free\" tour while in Amsterdam, choose That Dam Guide. We've done many walking tours across the globe, and this one sits among the best."

Intimate sized group and tons of info. Mark went over on time and STILL stayed afterwards to help answer any further questions, recommend further points of interest, or point people in directions they wanted to go. His love for this city and dedication to his customers is unmatched!My only tips - wear comfy walking shoes, and bring snacks! The tour went from 10:30 to nearly 2pm.

I found this tour by looking on trip advisor, so I'm writing this as my way of giving back to fellow trip advisor readers. (First time reviewer right here!). It is very easy to understand why Mark has gotten such great reviews from everyone.My husband and I did the Red Light tour. We are in our twenties and there were others in our group that looked to be in their 60s. That tells you the variety of people on this tour. I'm pretty sure at one point or another everyone literally laughed out loud. Mark has first hand accounts about tons of stops on the tour. He cheekily chalks it up to tour guide research. What really came across is how much he cares about the industry. My husband and I discussed that afterwards. He limites his tours to ten people not just for the enjoyment of those on the tours, but so he is not obtrusive to women who are trying to make their living. We saw other large tour groups gawking and blocking the streets and I was glad that I was not part of them.I learned far more about the policitcal climate than I thought I would. All that information was interspersed with humorous stories. I truly learned something today and that made the experience worth it ten times over.We even took Mark's advice and went to Da Portare Via afterwards for amazing pizza at a discount thanks to Mark's card!It would have been a much different experience if we decided to just explore the Red Light District on our own. Do yourself a favor and book Mark's tour. And book it fast! We wanted to do his City Tour, but it was already booked up and that was about a month ago!"

We'd signed up for Mark's tour a couple of weeks in advance, which I'd strongly recommend you do as well, since he does small group:-)s of 10 people per tour. This is key as it allows for great conversation along the way, and you're not being herded from stop to stop, only to wait on a group of 50 tourists to all catch up. I say that from experience as we passed two such groups. I believe those larger tours are free, but the nominal fee for Mark's tour is worth it just for his local perspective and recommendations (during our break he even called a restaurant and made a dinner reservation for someone on our tour since he said she'd never get in without one...and she got the last table of the night!)As for the tour itself, as most everyone else said, it's very fun and informative, and you get some great random facts about Amsterdam that I'm sure you'd never hear in a large group. As a few others have commented, it really is like having a good friend take you around town. Along our tour we stopped at a cheese shop and wound up returning there the following day for a cheese/wine pairing class, where we learned not only about cheese, but also got some more excellent \"local\" tips on where to drink & dine with the locals.All in all a great few hours with Mark, and I highly recommend his tour to anyone who's looking to learn the basic history of Amsterdam as you see some great sites along the way."

We ate the best fries in Amsterdam, the best chocolate cookie anywhere, and sat on a very special bench for a teenage girl (think Gus and Hazel). We came away with a great sense of both the history and the current state of the city (modern protests and so on). The pace was excellent. It's amazing to look back and think of how much we saw in just three hours, without feeling at all rushed or overwhelmed. I remember looking across a canal and learning about very old houses, while in the foreground a barge mounted crane pulled bicycles out of the water. I give Mark my highest recommendation, and I'm so glad we started our Amsterdam visit with him."

This is the only Trip-Advisor review that I have ever took the time to write, so hopefully that just proves how amazing these tours were. I cant stress enough how much better the small tours are. Amsterdam is sometimes a very loud and busy place, and unless you are a few feet from the guide, you will probably have trouble hearing him. He is extremely knowledgeable about the history of the city, as well as the RLD. It was nice to be able to just walk the streets and talk to him one-on-one. And don't be worried about the RLD tour, it is pretty laid back and ages ranged from teens to people in there 80s. Also, make sure to take his restaurant advice, he truly does know some of the best places to eat. I tried the apple pie at a restaurant next to the farmers market, andit was probably the best I have ever had. Do your self a favor and book this tour, after all how often are you in Amsterdam? might as well get the best tour while you're here.Josh- Houston, Tx"

You can sense his passion in his tour and he goes the extra mile to share with us the best cafes and restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the Whiskey bar and the French cafe recommended to us!

Mark was fun and upbeat and seemed to genuinely enjoy sharing his knowledge about Amsterdam. On his website he makes suggestions for places to eat/snack and his suggestions were spot on. We tried Da Portare Via (fabulous pizza in the Red Light District.) When we returned to Amsterdam to visit the museums, we ate at Venkel Salades (twice), Sweet Cup (for a great cup of coffee), Chocolaterie Pompadour, Droog (for a tasty lunch), and on another day while visiting the Jordaan District, we ate at Kinnaree (for a scrumptious Thai dinner) Mark gave us a discount card to use a some of the places. You can make arrangements to go on the walking tours via his website. When I did so, we got an immediate response. He also sent us follow-up emails with interesting links and facts that he spoke of during our tours. Fun, fun, fun!"

Mark is very interesting, had lots of good stories to tell and he is quite an advocate for the women in the Red Light district who are organizing into a union. However, I found that tour a bit depressing and wonder how many of those women, if they had other options, really want to be there. The RLD tour was 2 hours but the City Tour was 3 hours and a bit long, especially having to stand most of the time. Mark did take us by a great cheese shop where we bought some delicious goat cheese and also pointed out Da Portare Via where had the best pizza ever! Both places gave us a 20% discount with Mark's card...he says he doesn't get a kick back but passes that on to his customers. It was easy to find Mark with his orange tassel on his hat and easy to follow him on the sometimes crowded streets. Very worthwhile!"

My best friend and I decided to book a red light tour with Mark after the fantastic reviews on here.We were keen to see the area but weren't really sure how best to go about it as we didn't really know what to expect being first time visitors, but I'm really glad we chose to do a guided tour with Mark as he's so knowledgeable and insightful and certainly put an interesting spin on the tour. The time on the tour just flew by incredibly quickly!Mark met us in the stock exchange square and was very friendly and welcoming. There were a few people who didn't show up but he patiently waited for around 10minutes in case they had gotten lost.He pointed out all the interesting shops, told us hilarious stories about certain stores and I think what makes his tour worthwhile is that he knows the girls personally. He used to stay in the are, and used to run errands for them.A few of his close friends are ex workers too so he's got a good knowledge and experience to share.His tour is a great way to get a feel for the red light district, it felt like a great atmosphere and whilst walking around we seen everything worth seeing . He advised us the best places to eat in the area, and the best shops to go to. If you're looking for a little more than just a look he also advised the clubs to avoid and the ones worth a visit.All in all, very interesting tour and worth doing.Mark is lovely and I'd certainly book some of his others tours in future if I went back to Amsterdam. Thank you Mark for an enjoyable evening!"

The excitement and passion really showed in Mark, and right from the beginning it was clear that he really enjoys spending time with people and sharing his knowledge. We need more people in the tourism industry like this guy. Nowadays it seems like everyone is in a hurry to make a quick buck and just goes through the motions. Well not Mark. With such nice small groups, you really feel like you get a personal experience. He also has a pretty cool discount scheme with a few vendors where you get a discount if you show them his card, nice touch. Lastly, Mark was very very helpful leading up to the trip with my numerous questions. He showed me exactly where to store my bag (for a cheap price) during the tour, and gave excellent food recommendations. Take this tour, it's a great value for 20\u20ac!"

I am female and traveled by myself so I wasn't sure how to go about exploring the RLD. Taking the tour with Mark was excellent. The area is so interesting (as to be expected) but if you're not with a local who knows the ins and outs of the area, you'd miss out on a lot of the nuances (e.g. big girl alley or the statue dedicated to the workers) as well as the history of the trade and the current politics surrounding the area. Mark's very knowledgeable about the workers and their trade, the history, and the area. He's also a lot of fun and infused the tour with great stories. He even sheds light on how to 'engage' a worker. What really stood out for me though, was that Mark talked about the workers in the RLD with a ton of respect, zero judgement and highlighted a lot of issues they face as well as the misconceptions they have to deal with. As a female, I appreciated that. And oh, the small group size of the tour is such such a PLUS!!! We ran into one of the big company tours and oh boy, how anyone heard what the guide was saying was beyond me. Plus who wants to look like you're on a tour in the RLD anyways? The huge group screams tourist and you annoy the locals when all 20 of you are blocking the narrow alleys. With Mark's small group we were more inconspicuous (just a teeny weeny bit) Lol. Highly recommended! Btw if you didn't already assume this the RLD tour is explicit so not recommended for anyone not comfortable talking/hearing about sex."

He is also very personable and entertaining. One of the best things about this tour (besides Mark) is that he limits the size of the tour groups to a max of 10 people and he runs every tour himself. So you\u2019re always getting the best guide! Keeping it small allows for so much more dialogue as you\u2019re walking and flexibility. We had some unfortunate rainy/windy weather on the day of our tour, and Mark was able to lead us into a couple small cafes to stop for a coffee break and give everyone a chance to dry off and warm up. Even better, he knows so many of the local eateries and small businesses that you can get 10% when you mention his name. Thanks, Mark for an amazing tour! Would definitely do it again."

Most will give you an excellent history / sightseeing perspective, with Mark, you get more of a quirky and social commentary as well. Let's face it... you don't need to know the history of the RL district or bicycles... but to find out the going rate, the working girls perspectives and how many bicycles are fished out of the canals every year-- well, that it more captivating. I was travelling (unusually) with my 75 year old mother, who did very well -- it is 3 hours on your feet. I wish my teens would have been with us, as they would have really enjoyed the liberal view of this great city. Personally, I think Mark undercharges... v every other guide i have taken with such small groups. He really does mean no tips, which is nice, but I think unfair. I told him this, but like all businessmen starting out, he is underpaying himself. Worth twice the price. Best guide in any city I have travelled to"

We try find a recommended guide either as a private guide or who has very small groups when first vesting a new town to get an understanding of the history, culture and layout of the place (I had visited Amsterdam on number of occasions 40+ years ago but the memories are blurred for some reason). The guides who are the best in my view are those who are honest and enthusiastic about the subject - Mark met all of our hopes and expectations.For a first time visitor (or if you have not gone deeper in to the history of Amsterdam than you get on a canal tour), I highly recommend Mark's daytime tour."

Mark is a wonderful individual with a wealth of knowledge when it comes to the Red Light District. He gave us many interesting facts in detail about the different alleys, prices, how things worked, and the history of the place. I particularly liked that he had great respect for the girls working there. He answered all the questions we had and even offered to email us regarding any additional info we needed or answers to questions we may have.It was an interesting experience with the right guide. We were glad we chose right, and had a lovely night touring and taking photos of the different alleys and the canal."

Even when the weather decided to rain on us, Mark was adaptable and took the tour inside where he continued his story and suggested some fantastic beverages. Perfect!

We then set off and were entertained for the whole 2 hours we spent with Mark. He had so many stories and an inside knowledge of the area which made us see it in a whole new light. The tour itself was very personal as he only takes 10 people at a time (not like some of the other big tour companies that you will see with 20 - 30 people). We were able to ask questions throughout the tour and Mark had an answer and a story to go along with it for every one.After the tour Mark kindly invited us all for a drink and brought us to a lovely local bar that we would never have come across ourselves. He also emailed us after the tour with lots of helpful information (ideas for places to eat etc.) and a lovely souvenir photo from our night in the red light district.Would recommend this tour for all, don't leave Amsterdam without meeting Mark!

Mark is witty, intelligent and always accommodating to our group. It was blustery and a bit chilly on the tour date but he warmed us up with stories and history, I even got a souvenir from Mark to remind me of my Amsterdam trip ( a portable ladies' toilet...for those times when I cannot find a toilet). Mark, just to let you know that I have yet to use it, but will always think of you when and if I need to .

After checking some of the top tour guides, we opted to go with Mark. I can honestly say that his tours (we did both the city tour and the Red Light District tour) were the highlight of the trip. Mark is incredibly knowledgeable about the city and its history. At the start of the tour he gives you an \u201c800 years of Amsterdam in 5 minutes\u201d talk which is a great overview and really sets the stage for many of things he will show you on the tour. I asked questions throughout, and he always had great, thoughtful, and often funny answers to my (likely ridiculous) questions. I was asked which tour I liked better, and it\u2019s really difficult to say. The city tour was full of interesting history and funny anecdotes about the city. The night tour (RLD) gives you an interesting glimpse into a world you (or at least I) seldom see. I should also note that the RLD tour isn\u2019t just about the sex and sex workers, but a walk through the history and current political climate and social issues faced by the RLD workers; it was really fascinating.Many tour guides get \u201ckickbacks\u201d if they show people specific businesses and the person returns to purchase something. Mark has opted to pass these savings on to you. If you flash his business card at a handful of establishments, you can get a discount (what he would have gotten as a kickback) on your purchase. In addition, you will see tours packed with 20 to 40 people, which seems crazy. Mark caps his tours at 10, and you get to know the other tourists along the way (one of the great things about his tour is interacting with people from other countries). After the tour, Mark sends you some more information about the city, and links to some cool stuff. In addition, he will take a picture of you (and/or your group) at a fantastic spot in the RLD. The pic is emailed to you along with the other info he sends.Finally, even if you don\u2019t go on one of his tours (but let\u2019s face it, you absolutely should), check out his website for great food options. Some of the places he lists are real gems, the type of place a tourist could never find on their own. He provides excellent directions on the site, and if you tell him you want to eat at a place, he will point it out (or explain how to get there) while on the tour. I\u2019ve done tours all over the world, and this was easily one of the best."

We had a great time, mark is a very knowledgable guy and we had a laugh too! He took us to all the main parts that we needed to see and know about and gave us lots of information on the red light district, probably more in depth than any other tour as he used to live above one of the windows when he first arrived here, making friends with a few of the girls, so getting to know the stories behind the window I guess! There were quite a few organised trips, with about 25-30 people, going on at the same time. We were a group of 10, a mix of couples and groups and it was a lot better. We could hear what mark was saying, we didn't miss anything and we didn't get lost! We had a few people come up asking us where this certain group was as they had got lost along the way.... Not very fun if you ask me!! Would recommend doing the tour and not going to the Red Light Secrets museum which is on the red light district. Red Light Secrets creates a very negative view on the girls and the workings of the red light district, if you want to know the truth, book the Red Light District tour with Mark and Mark only!!!!!!!!!! Will be recommending to anyone going to Amsterdam \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f Thanks Mark, we had a great time!! Kirsty and Craig"

Plus he gives a lot of useful tips about good places to see and go afterwards (we did the tour on the first day of our stay and it was really useful in helping us to orient ourselves). The strength of the tour not only derives from Mark's personality and knowledge, but also from the fact that he keeps his groups small and intimate, which meant that he could respond well to our various different interests and questions and didn't need to spend his time shepherding (and counting) us and shouting at the top of his voice to be heard.

With only a few days to explore Amsterdam, we wanted to hit the ground running (3 adults + 3 teens) and a tour seemed like a good way to get started. We took Mark\u2019s day tour, and had such a fantastic time, we decided to take his Red Light tour (later in the evening) as well. Mark is incredibly knowledgeable and personable, and is an absolute gem of a storyteller. You will be thoroughly entertained! Mark deliberately keeps his groups small. It was well worth paying for the intimacy and maneuverability that a small group allows for (I think he limits his size to 10). He took us into cheese shops and jenevers distilleries for tastings, and showed us secret back-of-the-way places we would have never found on our own. Mark was prepared to provide us with raincoats and p-mates \u263a (we ended up not needing either) and he took us up the steepest hill in Amsterdam!It was cold on the day of our tour. He guided us into a (brown) cafe where we were served the best bowl of split pea soup (full of ham and potatoes) and toasted sandwiches I\u2019ve ever eaten. Mark got us oriented to Amsterdam \u2013 historically and politically \u2013 and also encouraged us to get to know each other. It was delightful to share conversation and drink beer, and hang out with the members of our group (who were from all over the world). Mark is originally from South Africa, and is quite in touch with of all the cultural and social nuances of the people in this city. ***If you want to see the Red Light District and really understand what you are seeing, do not miss the opportunity to take Mark\u2019s tour. You will be in excellent hands. (We left our teens at home for this tour, but a family with us had a 17 year old and she did just fine.) Mark holds nothing back. He\u2019ll answer all your questions and then answer some you perhaps were embarrassed/afraid to ask. He\u2019s frank and candid with so many fun stories about real people who work in this district, he\u2019s done his research, and collected interesting objects (you\u2019ve got to see to believe!) if only he could replicate himself \u2013 every visitor to Amsterdam should take a Red Light tour with Mark. In addition to being a very natty dresser, Mark is clever, funny, likable, good-looking and authoritative. He is highly professional and subtly irreverent. To summarize, I would describe Mark as part Oxford tutor, part Crazy Uncle and part Golden Retriever.I won\u2019t be a spoiler and give away the details, but suffice to say, you will have a GREAT time on either tour. He provides excellent follow-up (on e-mail) if you want further information about anything he\u2019s mentioned. It was simple to sign up for his tour on-line, and he was easily contactable by phone and by e-mail, and was more than happy to help us with practical matters like finding an electrical adaptor, helping us through the ins and outs of locking and stashing our bikes, recommending places to purchase whatever it was we needed whether it was a Chinese food late night snack for our hungry teens, or sex toys, or brownies, he knew where to send us.He asked us not to tip him, but if we enjoyed his tours to please let people know. I am so glad to write this review! I loved this city, and Mark\u2019s tours were truly my favorite things we did in Amsterdam."

We were a group of 8 on Cunard's Queen Victoria for the New Year voyage, on 31st Dec we visited Amsterdam and decided to book a private tour rather than those offered by Cunard, well, what a great decision! A quick look on Trip Advisor highlighted 'That Dam Guide' as a potential winner and a quick email exchange made the booking for the last day of the year. Mark met us at the terminal where we were berthed, spot on time and wearing the fetching pom pom that we would grow to love as we toured. Having introduced himself as a South African living in Amsterdam there was obviously a good story behind the change of location and lifestyle which I will leave for him to expound on I will only say it is fascinating and different - well done Mark. However, to the tour - in short it was great, Mark obviously knows his subject and delivers it with a passion born of experience. Do not be put off by the 'walking tour' bit, we were a group of 8 aged 60 - 74, reasonably fit and not a zimmer in sight and managed without any problem, it goes without saying that the route has no hills and coffee/beer breaks can be fitted in whenever required. The route can be be as varied, long or short as you wish and if you have specific sites to visit, for whatever reason, let Mark know, his knowledge seems to be inexhaustible.We covered the city area and then had a great lunch in the Cafe Sonneveld (meat ball recommended) and beer delicious. Then it was off to the Red Light District (RLD) - very educational!!!! Finally we stopped at 'De Prael' a micro brewery located in aforementioned RLD that produced some wonderful (and strong) beers. During the whole tour Mark continued to fill us with information and stories that brought the whole place to life. If I could give it 6 stars I would!"

Mark is professional yet friendly, and only takes a small group, so you really get a chance to chat and get to know each other. It's also easier for you to see the sites in a small group, rather than the massive ones of about 30 people that go past you. Mark is informative and engaging, and really makes you feel at ease. He also gives you an insider's perspective on how the industry actually runs, having lived above a window in his 20s. It was also really interesting to hear about the politicising of prostitution, which I had no idea about! Afterwards Mark took the majority of the group out for a drink at a local bar, where I think we were the only tourists there! Mark gave us good tips for things to see and do, and also sent us lots of information afterwards. We had a really great time, and I'm sure you will, too."

We took the Amsterdam tour in the morning and the Red Light District tour in the evening and really enjoyed both of them. In case you are wondering if there is overlap, there is none. The morning tour was a great overview of Amsterdam, its history and uniqueness plus little gems of information and entertaining facts that Mark sprinkles in throughout the tour. The Red Light District tour is very different but a lot of fun. The amount of information and detail that Mark shared were amazing. If you are looking to pick up some stories to entertain your friends this is the one to go to. You will get a follow up email with the links and some of the stories Mark shares in his tours."

Not only is Mark very knowledgable but also very funny. He made the whole experience a lot of fun. I prefer this anytime in comparison to the big guided tours like Sandeman's where people are herded together like cattle. Mark always had a small group. Infact I liked his Amsterdam day tour so much that I actually requested him if I could also join his Red Light Tour in the evening. Both tours were really good. My trip to amsterdam would not have been so much fun without this trip. Its a nice idea to take this trip in the first few days of your stay as this gives you a very good orientation of the city. Amsterdam is my favourite city in the world and Mark s simply the best tour guide!"

You could tell he was speaking from a base of knowledge and not just spouting off facts that someone may gleen off of the internet. His sense of humor only added to the fun. He conducts small tours of ten people which made the interaction with him easier. We stopped mid-way through the tour for a beverage break, which allowed time to ask questions about specific areas of the city we wished to see. The cost of the tour was very reasonable and well worth the value recieved. I would recommend this tour to anyone visiting the city."

You can get free walking tour guides in Amsterdam, but the groups are massive and they spend half their time trying to sell you things. Better to book with Mark and have a small group, more interaction and a great experience, he is a knowledgable and lovely guy.One of the first things Mark asked us is if we had anywhere to be afterwards in case it took longer... none of us did so our tour lasted much longer than the alloted time. I can't reccommend this tour enough - we had a guide book but this tour was so much more interactive and you could put the history in context and understand so much more about the culture and the way in which things have happened over the years.Mark also took us to a cafe (not the 'special' kind!) and provided tips on where to go and when and marked a map for us where everything was. One of the things that we wanted to do was watch the official NYE fireworks - Mark told us exactly where to stand and we had a great time! He also told us to get to the Anne Frank museum at 8am in the morning (an hour before opening time) to avoid the queue which we did. I think if we hadn't we wouldn't have been able to see it as the queue behind us was immense - we are very grateful for the advice.Mark also sent us an email after the tour with lots of further information on things to do and some links to find out more about amsterdam itself.Overall excellent - don't go to Amsterdam without doing it!"

Some of the sights on the RLD tour are quite graphic (which is to be expected) but rather than letting us feign awkwardness mark approached the subject straight on encouraging the whole group to let go a bit and understand the dynamics of the district. the Tour group was very small about 7 of us which made ti even better when we were being followed by groups of 30+ and it allowed your own questions to be answered! We all went to the pub afterwards and was a good chat! He is so knowledgable and you will deffo come out having learnt more."

We learned lots and am sure saw and experienced many things that we would never had done had we explored alone or on a more commercial tour with a big group. This was a fabulous three hours, we never felt rushed and felt like we gained a real insight into Amsterdam life, topped off with a fantastic local pea and ham soup at the street market and an introduction to Winkles and their infamous Apple Pie and Cream, the highlight of our weekend - so good we went back on Sunday.Well done Mark, you are doing a great job and we cant recommend your tour highly enough."

The tour was amazing and the perfect way to start a city break in Amsterdam - ideal for getting your bearings and learning about the city. Mark provides a perfect balance between a knowledgeable tour and one that is amusing and entertaining to go on. Below are key points about the tour:1) An average rating of 4.96 / 5 from over 450 reviews shows that you are getting a great tour.2) Mark limits the groups to a maximum of 10 so you get a personal tour that is tailored to the group's interests.3) A 10.30 start and approximately 13.30 finish make it the perfect activity to start your trip leaving you plenty of time during the remainder of the day.4) The tour isn't too short / long and breaks are well managed so you aren't exhausted and can enjoy the tour.5) Mark is able to recommend from firsthand experience the best attractions to visit, places to eat, etc.6) Instead of getting commissions from these recommendations Mark asks that people who go on his tour get discounts.Overall, this is an awesome tour and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who visits Amsterdam."

We really enjoyed that the group was small so that we could focus on what he was saying, as well as navigate through the streets together as a group. After the tour, he provided us with additional information and websites, which were fascinating and informative. He goes above and beyond the expectations of a guide - a true model for guides to follow. When visiting Amsterdam again, we will definitely attend his other tour."

We went on Mark Law's tour of the Red Light District on a Saturday night.The tour lasted roughly 1.5 hours and was an informative, yet a light-hearted fun way to explore the RLD and learn more about Amsterdam in general and the Red Light trade there.Mark was a very pleasant, friendly guide. The tour was made more personal by only allowing small group numbers and having personal photos taken on the tour. Without going on the tour, we wouldn't have discovered gems that lie within the RLD. However, the tour was short enough to be able to explore at your own pace after the tour had finished.I would definitely recommend Mark's tours if you want to learn more about Amsterdam in a fun and friendly group!"

I took to him immediately; what a lovely chap.Mark gives an amazing rundown of the Red Light district - his firsthand experiences living there, personal anecdotes and stories from the ladies working in the district, and his passion for the history and economic / sociographic / demographic of the Red Light district makes him the perfect person to take you around on a very personal tour.I was lucky to have only another couple on my tour, so Mark zipped us around the place showing off the juiciest bits of the District. We laughed plenty with his stories of the old, young, and cheeky women working in the area. If you're looking for a shallow tour and gawking at scantily dressed ladies of negotiable affection, this isn't it - Mark knows more about the history and nuances of the area than any of those other free tours.He's also a foodie - fantastic recommendations on drinks and eats in Amsterdam (btw Mark I went for the Chinese restaurant - the Lamb Roti was just the thing I needed).Trust me - go with Mark. He knows."

What a treat to have such an eloquent, knowledgeable guide to present the history of the town - all the way to the present day with its civilized forward-thinking inhabitants. To my surprise, Amsterdam is classy. I felt comfortable and liberated walking around town. I did not see a policeman anywhere!A few weeks after we got home, thinking about Mark's presentation, I realized what a special presenter he is. He captured my complete attention for the entire 2\u00bd hour tour, despite the cool and windy October weather. My wife and I can proudly say that we have made a friend in Amsterdam and it's on our lost of places to re-visit.We highly recommend anyone planning to visit Amsterdam to take one of Mark's tour. He lays out facts with a flare and humor, whether your interests are in art, architecture, history, drugs and/or the sex industry. Or just like us \u2013 we just wanted to get our bearings and some sense of the city. We got more than we bargained for. Dam, what a guide!"

He is knowledgeable, personable and honest about his beloved Amsterdam. I was afraid he would be more suited for younger people because we are in our mid 60's, but I have to say we thoroughly enjoyed this tour from start near the Red Light District to finish in the Jordaan Market area 3 hours later. This is the way I like to learn (or relearn) history! There were 9 in our group, ranging in age from the 20's to another couple in their 60's. Everyone was attentive and asking questions. The older couple had been on Marks RLD Tour the night before and said how much they enjoyed it. So my husband and I tried to sign up for Marks RLD Tour for that night. Sorry to say there were already 10 people registered. Mark sticks to 10 people max. Be sure to book in advance so you will not be disappointed as we were. So, do not hesitate to book these tours, you will happy you did. I loved Amsterdam! And thanks Mark for the follow up email with links to Netherlands/Holland info. Very interesting.

The morning city tour is a fabulous way to get your bearings if you're unfamiliar with Amsterdam, and we both felt we knew not only the background and history of the city far better after the tour, but also had a greater awareness of the geography of the city centre as well. Mark loves his history, and we loved his passionate discourse on the birth of the city, and its place in European culture to the modern day. It was great to have a small group where we could always hear him, and easily chat and ask questions if we wanted. We saw some of the so called 'free tours' marching around the city at the same time as us, and just didn't feel like we'd have got the same from a tour with 40 other people! There's very little crossover with the red light district tour, and we found it equally interesting and above all a lot of fun! Mark is always ready to share an interesting anecdote, and particularly his impassioned opinions about the red light district, having lived there for a while, and got to know many of the local characters. Hugely recommend either or both of these tours if you're going to be in town."

Frankly, we didn't know what to expect when we made a reservation for Mark Law's evening tour of the Red Light District, but based on the TripAdvisor reviews for Mark, we booked it a month in advance of our trip. And we're glad we did - Mark did an outstanding job of presenting the color, the culture, the details of what go on in the district today and in the past, and the social perspective on legalized prostitution. Take the tour early in your visit ... it's definitely allowed us to look at the Amsterdam street world from a different perspective through the balance of our visit. Mark was a lot of fun and informative ... a great combo!"

What's also nice is it doesn't feel like one of those scripted tours where the guide has ready made answers and jokes or the ones that shepard you around on an exactly timed route. The group is small enough so he can relate to the different questions and interests of the participants, and you can see him determining the route to take advantage of the best things that might be happening that morning. The tour was supposed to end at 1.30 but we continued till after 2 pm, after he made sure none of us were in a rush anywhere.I can highly recommend this as a really good way to get to know the city before you go exploring on your own! Enjoy!"

We have been to Amsterdam a couple of times in the past and always wanted to know a little bit more about the history of the RLD. So on this trip we booked the 2 hour RLD tour with Mark based on his excellent Trip Advisor reviews. Mark provides a fantastic insight into the area and the girls who work there. His tour is done at a good pace with plenty of time to stand and take in the atmosphere. The size of the group was perfect (max 10 people) which works well on the crowded streets of the RLD. The stories, facts and history that Mark talks about are all delivered with passion and clearly well researched or from first hand experience. Overall a very well organised, factually interesting tour delivered with great humour by a gentleman who is passionate about what he does. Thank you Mark. "

I enjoyed it so much that my friends and I attended his Day Tour the following day. Upon returning to Amsterdam this summer, I assured my travel mate that our first priority needed to be finding Mark. We were unable to catch his day excursion, but we made it just in time to attend his unforgettable tour of the Red Light District (for what would be a second viewing in my case). Since I was last there, Mark has struck out on his own as an independent guide and I was curious to see how his tour had changed. Two things struck me. First, I was in awe at how Mark's tour had evolved to reflect new developments in the city. It is clear he is always researching and adding new anecdotes and facts to best reflect and connect todays Amsterdam with the Amsterdam of the past. Second, I was amazed at how many of the old stories I still remembered. Mark's delivery is that of a man who truly loves his city and as such, he winds an immersive narrative that will stick with you long after you leave. If you wish to explore the Amsterdam beneath the surface and, if your as lucky as I am, make a friend, I highly suggest this tour."

He also managed to find us toilets in various places. The Chinese restaurant recommended by Mark was fantastic and authentic. Later I was informed that the chef was from Hong Kong thus that explained. Mark also recommended us his favorite pizza place and the pizzas were delicious. The tours were marginally more expensive when compared to other \"free\" tours but IMHO the money was well spent."

My husband and I took two tours with Mark in one day, the first being his general overview of the City, and his second being his evening Red Light District Tour. We thoroughly enjoyed both of them, and found Mark to be extremely knowledgeable, personable, and insightful. He's a really nice guy, and he brings his love and understanding of the City, its residents, its history and its politics to the forefront. Particularly interesting to me was how he approaches the Red Light District Tour -- he handles the subject with a good deal of humor, but also with a great deal of compassion and understanding and humanity. He used to live in the neighborhood (above one of the windows), and he knows some of these girls well. He neither condones nor condemns, but he does shed light on a pretty unique area. At the end of the day tour, he invited all of us to join him for the best apple pie in Amsterdam at Winkel (and it really was!), and my husband and I joined him. It was a lot of fun spending a little extra time with him and learning even more about the city, but also about him and his tour-guiding business. And after the evening Red Light District Tour, he invited that group to join him at a nearby bar for a beer. We declined that invitation, but some of the group joined him, and I have no doubt it was a good time. Mark really wants to deliver the goods to those who go on his tours, and he really does. We couldn't have enjoyed our time with him more."

I dread the typical walking tour experience--a herd of glassy-eyed tourists shepherded around by a cheerful guide checking off the \"must-see\" sights in the city. We can do that kind of tour ourselves with a decent guidebook. What we look for (and can't always find) is a tour that makes us feel like we're really getting to know a place--what it's like now, how it got to be that way, and where it might be going in the future. We also want it to feel personal. Mark delivers this kind of experience as well as anyone I've known. First, he limits the group to 10 people. You don't feel herded, and everyone has a chance to interact easily with him on a personal level. Also, over 2+ hours he gets to know each of you well enough to shade the experience according to the groups' interests. He's smart, funny, engaging, and he loves Amsterdam and it's people. He's originally from away, so he brings an outsider's sense of discovery and objective appreciation for the places and personalities of this great city. He covers the sites, all the must-sees, but gives you so much more. He mixes in generous amounts of history, current events, and anecdotes to bring out all the city's color and light. You walk away feeling like you've gotten a generous taste of what really makes this one of the world's most fascinating cities. That would be enough. But then he follows up with an email containing tidbits and links that enhance some of the things brought up in the tour and recommendations for further explorations on your own. All in all, a completely wonderful experience, well worth anyone's precious vacation time."

You can see his passion for Amsterdam as he unconsciously caresses the bridge rails and rusty bicycles along the tour. Shop owners step out to wave to him, and he calls back to them by name. He stops for a second to take photos of people who aren't even on the tour. His eyes light up talking about the water in the city, and somehow he even makes that exciting. Reverently he describes individuals from the city have influenced our world to become a more tolerant place.Authentic and open-minded, at one point I overheard him discretely explaining to a more seasoned couple from the States how to enjoy smoking a joint before dinner. Then he stopped the tour to explain that he refuses a commission from his favorite cheese shop for bringing customers because he wants his tours to know he only recommends the best he can find. Finally, he carried the tour on an extra hour just to show us his favorite out of the way nooks in the Jordaan and share his favorite apple pie with us.Wow! Congratulations, Mark, on an unforgettable tour! My only warning to would be tour participants is to keep in mind where you are and what you're doing. You will see prostitutes, smell pot wafting along the route, be invited to eat raw fish, talk about sexuality, and be asked to keep an open mind. It's Amsterdam, after all, not Disneyland."

He definitely had the inside scoop.This tour is meant to build the women up, and not demean them--so if you're going to gawk, think again. Great way to say you did the RLD....without actually doing it. Ha!"

I'm now reading the book he recommended, _Amsterdam_ by Russell Shorto, and learning even more. We saw many of the buildings that I'd seen in tour guides, and now understand a lot more about their background and about the history of the city.We are in our 60s, and the walking was not a problem. Mark included both a bathroom stop and an ice cream stop. He really made the city come alive!"

This tour may not be for everyone as it can be quite graphic, but if you are interested in how the whole system works, you must go with Mark. He was straight forward, open to questions, and is very informative. We were a private group of 8 - don't hesitate asking Mark to set up a private tour if your schedule doesn't jive with his planned tours. We learned a lot."

If you are interested in seeing the Red Light District or learning about prostitution in the Netherlands, then a tour with Mark is a great way to do it. We learnt loads from our tour, and it never felt disrespectful to be there- this was much nicer than going around in a big group which is what all the other tours seemed to be. As others have mentioned, Mark will share personal stories with you which makes everything much easier to relate to- he has clearly put a lot of effort into preparing a tour which puts across an accurate reflection of life for the women who work there which makes it a very worthwhile experience."

That Dam Guide was very highly rated and, after spending three hours with Mark, we understand why. He is extremely knowledgeable about the city, very personable and has a great sense of humor. We covered a lot of territory in the time we were with him and answered all of our questions - he stayed with us after the tour was done just so he could answer everybody's question. The cost of the tour was most reasonable. Mark limits his groups to 10 people, but when we contacted him, we learned he already had 8 and there were 4 of us. Mark was really accommodating in agreeing to expand the group to 12 - and we were so glad he did. If you're looking for a really good guy who knows a lot about Amsterdam and makes it interesting - Mark is your guy."

Thank you Mark and when in Amsterdam, we will see you again!"

He interacts with a group of 6 to 10 people in a way that larger companies can't (they are dealing with mobs of 40 -60 people). And... very importantly, Mark respects the working girls and conducts the tour in a way which does not negatively impact them."

Mark is absolutely fantastic and hugely entertaining and knows Amsterdam inside out, he can tell you anything you want to know! After these tours we knew Amsterdam like the back of hand because we knew where everything was! Both tours are extremely entertaining and informative, and with the tours capped at around 10 people it ensures that you get the absolute best experience, and can ask any questions along the way. Overall, I would totally recommend this tour to anyone of any age! You won't get the same experience from any other tour operators (trust me, our group was the group laughing and having a great time as we walked past the other tour groups of 40+ plus people who looked miserable!!) DO IT!"

After booking both the RLD tour and the city tour I had a few questions that I send thru in email and Mark's response time was phenomenal and very helpful. The RLD district tour was a personal favourite, extrenely informative about current information and also the history. He is very passionate about what he does and does research about what he tells you, which is what made both tours so memorable and amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. We took a canal tour the next day in Amsterdam and it was poor quality information and crappy service. Nothing compares to that Dam Guide! Thank you again Mark for all you help, advice and really being our number 1 favourite thing about Amsterdam :) :)"

On Friday, July 4th, we had the opportunity to take both Mark's City Tour and then later in the evening, his Red Light District Tour. His tours are advertised as a tour of the history and growth of Amsterdam, as opposed to a \"highlights\" or \"best sights\" tour. He was SPOT ON!!!Mark was very informative, funny, and went out of his way to answer any questions thrown at him. A previous reviewer that was on our same tour was bothered by Mark trying to get away from loud distracting noises, and we found that to be a very good thing. It is really hard to be able to get information across when the streetsweepers are chasing you across the square, and when kids are just mindlessly ringing a bike bell!His City Tour covered a lot of ground, including China Town, the Red Light District (briefly... much more in depth later in the evening on his RLD Tour), the history of the canals and their purpose, and then ended up over by the Anne Frank House.We loved both of his tours and would highly recommend Mark for anyone wanting to get a good overview of Amsterdam and its history, culture, and current life. One last item.... Mark told us about the bar at the top of the Doubletree Hotel and said it was a great view of the city. Also, since we were there on a Saturday morning, he told us about a great local market in the Jordaan area that we went over to and walked around. Both of these suggestions were very much appreciated."

One would think a tour of the RLD would emphasize the titillating sights, which Mark's tour included but we also were schooled about the history, the politics, the problems, the hows, whys and wheres. Thanks, Mark, for a fun AND thought-provoking tour.. We look forward to returning to Amsterdam and will book Mark's other tours when we do. Fyi: the price was fair and our group was 8."

Mark was very likable and outgoing as well as passionate about his adopted city. He came across as really concerned that we all learned from and enjoyed his tour. We were a small group and he made it clear that he was open to tailoring the tour to our interests and we did indeed adjust as we went along. We thought he gave a great overview not only on the city layout, but it's overall history without being overwhelming. He gave an introduction to the Red Light District, but unfortunately his Red Light tours weren't available during our visit. Next time! We think the cost of the tour was quite reasonable, but note that if you choose any coffee breaks or exhibit admissions those costs are extra. One note on a critical comment from a review concerning Trip Advisor. He did make a reference to TA reviews, but only in the context of any self aware businessman. He certainly didn't ask us to write a review much less anything favorable. Mark made every effort to make the tour entertaining and worthwhile. We certainly recommend him."

The Red Light tour was interesting and Mark knows the players, the history, and brings you up close and personal with the action. Mark takes that industry seriously and also has fun with it. The City Walking Tour was our favorite. Mark allowed for stops with the herring vendor, explaining the history of that in Amsterdam. He also stopped at the Cannabis College as an optional stop to listen to the \"weed professor\", another great character in Amsterdam. Of course, Mark stops and walks you through and over canals. For history buffs, there is the visit to world's first stock market and the Guild building. Mark is full of energy and entertains and teaches. He also answers everyone's questions. A couple quick points on the negative review below. We happened to be on both tours with the Plano couple. Mark certainly did recommend the top of the Doubletree for a drink and great views. His problem with noise on the morning tour more related to finding spots where a full group could hear him. In any case, most everyone loves Mark's tours and it's easy to see why."

After a quick intro, what followed was an incredibly interesting and fun three hour walking tour of the city. Mark knows his stuff, not only was the tour educational but his openness was very welcome. He knew stories that I can't imagine another tour guide telling (in a good way!).We even enjoyed a couple of local beers with Mark at the end of the tour and he recommended places for us to visit that evening near our hotel, which was very helpful.Don't hesitate in booking a tour with Mark, you'll definitely learn something new and have some great laughs along the way!"

As a person, Mark has a fun personality with a good sense of humor. A recent reviewer may have hit the nail on the head that Mark can be impacted by the environment at times. After reading more reviews on here, I feel Mark's expertise and passion may shine more during the Red Light District Tour. The tour was beneficial to us in that we saw several sights that we wanted to see and allowed us to gain a better bearing of the city. However, it was underwhelming in terms of amount of ground covered."

After reading about the disappointment of many that they did not take both of his tours, I decided that we would book both. The Red Light District tour was great - I would give 4 stars. Mark really seemed, on this tour at least, to love the city and he keeps it interesting and it was fun. He showed us great pubs and told us about the coffee shops. He definitively seems to have an affinity for the sex worker and that industry and was passionate about fair treatment - almost to an annoying fault. That was the NIGHT tour. Overall, it was worth the 15 Euros per person.Now for the DAY tour...first I will put a disclaimer that everyone has bad days, and maybe that was his day. Mark was irritable from the beginning and perhaps it was because he, admittedly, stayed out late the night before. He was really bothered by noises that are natural in a city environment: Street Cleaners, babies crying, people talking, bicycles ringing bells. From the start, he moved us all around the square trying to avoid the street cleaners that were doing their job and CLEANING THE SQUARE!, He snapped at people walking by that he thought were making too much noise because they were simply TALKING, he gave babies evil looks because they were crying, and he even stopped our tour to tell a family on bikes to stop ringing their bells because he was giving a tour. Each time a noise occurrence happened, he stopped the tour and showed his frustration. That became increasingly bothersome to us and we could not wait for the Day tour to end. The next day we took a cab out to a golf course and the cabbie was more informative about the best places in Amsterdam. For example, we did the Heineken experience, against Mark's advice, and we LOVED it. We also went to the top of the Double Tree Hotel for the \"best view of the city\" which we learned from our CABBIE!In summary, Mark is a nice enough person and kudos to him for breaking away and starting his own tour service. I imagine that the reason Mark gets #1 ranking at Trip Advisor is because he is good at asking for reviews at the end of his tour and also following up via email and asking for reviews."

I completely agree with reviewer B.G._Chicago (see review 2nd July 2014) - I would have preferred a shorter tour with some more emphasis on the architecture & the people. Also felt a bit rushed taking photographs - its feels rude to take photographs when your guide is talking, but a few minutes at the end just to give people a chance to take photos would be appreciated :) Overall, we felt it was great value for the price we paid, and we had a really enjoyable afternoon out walking around this beautiful city."

Mark always waited until everyone was gathered around before he started his talk. The red light district tour was really fun.

Mark has a true passion for the city and its history, and his passion shines throughout the tour. We started the tour near the Red Light District, and then walked over a few \"must see\" bridges. Mark pointed out a variety of things we would have not noticed on our own, such as the fact that the city has few stairs, the interesting outdoor \"bathrooms\" throughout the city, and a funny demonstration on how women can also use the bathrooms. We then traveled through the Dam Square area (where Mark introduced us to delicious croquettes on a break), and ended up near the Jordaan neighborhood. He kindly pointed us in the direction of a great Saturday market nearby after the tour. It was quite easy to book the tour with Mark, and his website contains fantastic information on restaurants, bars, coffee shops, museums, etc. I cannot stress enough how knowledgeable Mark is about Amsterdam.My only criticisms are the strong historical focus of the tour and the tour length. As noted above, Mark is passionate about history. He really highlighted the strength of the Dutch throughout history, the spice trade, and Dutch influence on other countries. On an introductory city tour, however, I expect a brief introduction to the history of the place I am visiting, and then I hope that the tour will focus on the present facts of the city: what people typically eat, why is there such a influx of bikes compared to other cities, what is a typical day/night like for someone living in Amsterdam, etc., etc., etc. I want to leave a tour feeling like I know every aspect and sense of a city. This was lacking a bit. Perhaps Mark can offer a separate history tour for history buffs - I think he would be perfect at that. Additionally, the tour dragged on a bit for us. Our tour lasted three hours, and we would have been happy with two hours. Once again, if the history parts were cut out a bit (like the extended stay in the spice trade building center and underground bike rack area), I think this would have made us perfectly happy. Overall, however, we did not regret taking the tour with Mark, and we wish him the best of luck with his tours."

He has lived throughout the area, hence knows the local environment and not the tourist attractions. Well worth the 15euros each and a bit more at the end. Stay in a small group and enjoy their country and culture. We did!"

Neither of us are \"tour oriented\" people, we'd usually rather just discover cities at our own pace. That being said, a guide with a Ponpon already told us that this wasn't your average walking tour. We got lucky and booked the last 2 spots on the 3 pm walking tour of Amsterdam... and we both agreed we were very glad we got to go on Mark's tour. It was informative, the content was anything but generic and there were no \"hard sell\" stops like with big tour companies where you stop at souvenir shops/chocolate shops (etc) and feel forced to buy things you really don't want/need. We instead made stops at unusual places that you wouldn't otherwise go in as a tourist, I learned a lot about the Netherlands' history and got to see quirky alleys and better understand how Amsterdam came to be the city it is. Lots of humour on the tour, a bit of a political talk, so if you are the kind of person who likes neutrality and monotone, boring tours, then this may not be for you, but otherwise, you'll wish the tour was longer than 3 hours. One of the best investment of our trip! Go and book ahead to save yourself a spot!"

You can find your giggles and experience your self rightousness or secretly lust. Whatever. For me what made this tour special was that Mark goes beyond the perspective of these women as objects. He has developed friendships with some of them, talks with them about their attitudes toward their work and he helps us understand as well. Mark is a strong advocate for these women, their rights, and the political structures that support their rights and safety, or that need to be changed. This is so much more complex an issue than I imagined and greatly appreciate the intensity Mark brings to educating his guests for a few hours. This is the tour for those who want to learn and understand this cultural phenomenon. Who are the women behind the glass doors? Where do they come from, and why? What are their hopes for a future life after this work? Mark helps with some of the answers, and helps us see the sex workers as real peopl. And, Mark makes it a lot of fun along they way."

I'm pretty adventurous when I'm exploring, but I never would have thought to take some of the turns Mark took, and without him I would have missed some charming sights!Mark is passionate about his adopted city, and he's a masterful storyteller who knows the history of the city and the people who shaped Amsterdam. There were four of us on our tour, on a beautiful May afternoon, and we enjoyed ourselves so much we ended up extending the day through a light dinner and drinks at a caf\u00e9.I highly recommend Mark's tour as an introduction to Amsterdam, or just as an alternative to all the museums and crowded tourist attractions."

What fun!As long as you're not easily offended, this is a terrific tour for seeing & learning about the unusual ways that one world-class city deals with sex & prostitution. Mark has so many stories based - according to him - on personal, factual experiences, that the tour is endlessly fascinating, funny, & provocative. He's one of the most engaging tour guides we've had anywhere on our travels. And he keeps each group small, so all the commentaries & discussions are easily heard by everyone.Perhaps most interesting were the many floor-level, full-length-window doorways, behind which a variety of [mostly] young ladies posed & gestured to attract clients.As you might imagine, the different varieties of sexual experiences that you can pay for in Amsterdam cover a WIDE spectrum, & so do the devices for sale in the sex shops. Be prepared for some very frank use of language that - to us - seemed appropriate for the topics."

Joining Mark's City Tour on the morning of my first day in Amsterdam was the best thing I could have done to give me an orientation of the city neatly wrapped in an overview of its history. Mark has a great sense of humour and built a really interesting historical story over our 3.5 hour tour. It gave so much more meaning to the many museums, canal houses and other activities I undertook over the following days. The benefit of Mark's insistence on having a maximum of 10 people on his tour became really obvious when I joined his Red Light District tour at the end of my visit. This meant he was able to share his experiences and knowledge of the area quietly and discretely to our small group who didn't stand out at all, compared with the snaking lines of 30+ people who would take up much of a small lane way as they followed a single guide from one of the larger tour companies. I highly recommend Mark's tours to anyone visiting Amsterdam."

We did the city tour on 31 May 2014.Mark is very friendly, has a great sense of humor and is very informative. He knows the city's history and every nook and cranny extremely well. His recommendations on what to see and eat is spot on fantastic! He guides you with such enthusiasm and patience, you will not find any other tour of Amsterdam that compares. Thank you Mark for the tour. We loved every bit of it, and the pizza you recommended is soooo good! :)"

First, we had the Red Light District Tour on the night we arrived, and I have to say that Mark KNOWS Amsterdam like the back of his hand, and has ALL of the insider information!! The second morning we took Mark's City Tour and it was so informative and gave us a fantastic overview of the city and all the sights. I love that Mark limits his tours to 10 people because it is so much more personal than the large comercial tours that are much more expensive. If you want to do a walking guided tour in Amsterdam, you MUST at least take one (or two) of Mark's tours!! Word has spread about how great they are, so sign up online because he gets booked in advance.Thank you Mark for a wonderful introduction to Amsterdam, such a unique city. Was a true pleasure!!!! ~Stephanie & Tracy"

He was very knowledgable about the area, and had a lot of indepth information for us. With a small group of about 10 people, it was personal and we were able to ask questions with ease. The walking pace was perfect (not too fast, not too slow) for two adults and a pre-teen.Mark brought us to not only the \"must see\" locations, but also to some out of the way locations that tourists would never venture into (which was worth it)! We stopped for a bathroom break near a spot where we could buy a snack as well.Having completed walking tours in several other major European cities, I can promise you that Mark is highly professional, reasonably priced and very knowledgeable. Highly recommend this tour!"

It is clear that he as read quite a bit about each area that we passed through. It is not a typical \"look over there...that is the Old Church building.\" Rather he included an in depth accounting of the religious history of Amsterdam and how it related to the church and to current customs. Because it was a private tour, we (three of us) could stop and ask questions and divert him from the normal route to things of our interest. It offered us a great overview of the city. Mark offers much information in person as well as on his website. I would highly recommend Mark as a tour guide"

It's been very instructive and interesting, despite having been already to Amsterdam and having done a guided tour, this time I learned a whole bunch of new things, like about Matatuli, or the happenings in the 70s and the fact that historic houses have survived also thanks to those that occupied them \"illegally\"...! Also the \"policy\" of sticking with only 10 people or so makes it much easier to follow and listen rather than \"fighting\" with other participants to get your share of questions. Also, Mark makes it last much more than the planned 2 hours, so there's no hassle and if you have time, you even have the chance to have a beer with him after the tour (not sure if this applies to all tours though).

He's very attentive to what the group wants or questions they have. We really enjoyed his tour and would highly recommend that you go with Mark.

His tour provides a good mix of humour/seriousness and the whole group clearly enjoyed the experience. After the tour, most of the group went home. However Mark took myself and Becky to a quirky little microbrewery which served some impressive local beer. We all got on really well socially and he seemed genuinely excited to share his experiences and funny stories with us. I think it shocked him at first but once he got used to us \u2013 I think he enjoyed our outgoing and cheeky personalities.Becky and I are both glad we met Mark \u2013 really felt he helped make our holiday such a good one."

Be sure to make note of various shops that he points out: We ended up going back to the cheese shop (for a wine and cheese tasting afternoon) and a sweet shop (best stroopwafels I've ever had).

I fortunately met Mark randomly in a cafe, and after chatting with him about his presentation on the Red Light District, my interest was certainly piqued! That evening, we went on a 2 hour tour of the neighborhood, and Mark gave our group an intimate, respectful, thorough look at many aspects of the RLD, giving overviews of the history of legalized prostitution in the region, who worked there and how, and what the political situation it today in the area. Mark plotted our tour so that our group would not impede upon the business of the women working in the windows, and gave us a thorough insiders look at how prostitution in the area operates. I came away more informed, and feeling like I had just been as ethical as a tourist to the area as I could have hoped to be.

(Turns out that he is a veteran tour guide who has struck out on his own.) Mark prefers smaller groups, and the quality shows, since there is more time for questions while keeping the tour moving along. I strongly recommend Mark for three reasons: (1) He provides better quality tours because his groups are smaller; (2) His experience is as much or more than other tour guides; and (3) his pricing is very competitive. I hope you enjoy the time with him when you are in Amsterdam as much as I did."

Over the course of three hours we learned a great deal about the 800+ year history of Amsterdam and how it came to be the beautiful and exciting city that it is today. With a small group of fellow tourists it was easy to hear Mark and get our questions answered. He is, entertaining, incredibly knowledgeable of the city and a tremendous resource for other things to do in Amsterdam."

Whilst visiting the city with my mum for the weekend we decided to book this city tour with mark as an introduction to the city on the first day if our visit. It was the perfect introduction to seeing some if the highlights of Amsterdam. Mark was a very interesting and amusing guide and his love of the city is obvious. The tour was verging on 3 hours when we finished the tour in a market none of us seemed to want it to finish. We learned an awful lot about the city with some good recommendations on places to return to. I just wish we'd had time to join his red light tour in the evening. Thank you Mark for a great beginning to our weekend away."

I highly recommend this tour for anyone looking to learn more about this amazing city."

Mark is an excellent guide - very knowledge on all you would want to know about Amsterdam and amusing too. Mark also showed us a couple of places that I do not think we would have found on our own - Reypenaer Cheese Shop where we went for a cheese and wine tasting the next day and the wonderful waffle shop with it's homemade ice cream. Thank you Mark for helping to make our trip to Amsterdam so enjoyable. Hope to be back one day and join in another of your tours."

Even with a group of 10, it is occasionally difficult to take in sidebar conversations along the way. But Mark made sure that everyone had a chance to ask their specific questions, and would be sure that all were present at the next stop before beginning the stories.Good job, Mark... will certainly recommend your tours to others!"

Originally from South Africa,Mark is full of energy and has an abundance of local and historic knowledge. He puts it across in a humorous and entertaining way. My concern for him is that the fifteen euros per person is not enough for him to live off. I also feel this is exceptional value for money.

He also stopped in a lovely cafe for us to get warm which was just what everyone wanted. Only because he hosts such small groups is this possible and it's definitely worth the extra money as you also get to chat freely and ask whatever questions you want.It's a shame a group of 4 had booked but then didn't show as Mark always has to turn people away and we had to wait a bit to guarantee they weren't running late.

My boyfriend did't want to take the tour, but eventually he said it was the best thing we did in Amsterdam.Great stories, flexible route, most importantly small and personalised approach (small groups - we were 6)! There is certainly quality in Mark's tours. On the way we saw other guided tours with huge groups of 30-50 people wondering around like lost sheep. So I felt even more special being in such a small group.The tour was supposed to be 2.5 hours, but Mark did it for extra one hour without extra charge! Also because I was the first to book this tour and I could not manage to do it at 11 in the morning due to late arrival to Amsterdam, so Mark very kindly changed the time for us! He is superb in all senses and very very funny and knowledgeable! He simply loves Amsterdam and you can understand this if you go on his website. We visited many of the places he suggests on his web and we were very pleased in every single place we went! DO NOT MISS the opportunity to have a great time in Amsterdam!!!"

We had a small tour (4 people), Mark made us feel very welcome, then proceeded to walk us through the Red Light District stopping to tell us it's stories and history in great detail. He was very passionate about all aspects of the area and it's people, telling tales that had all 4 of us laughing throughout. I think this is where \"That Dam Guide\" really stands out. This is not a by the numbers tour but took different directions depending on our interaction with our guide. Mark also answered questions on all aspects of Amsterdam and introduced us to a few very nice bars - he even helped us order some local beers and stayed for a chat.I would highly recommend taking this tour if you are in Amsterdam, it shows that the RLD is not just stag parties and prostitution. Every door tells a different story and Mark seems knows them all."

He had personalized the tour to what we had asked him for. The history, culture and the things Amsterdam has to offer now. He had listened to what I had asked for and did a fantastic job. We spent 7 hours with him and that set us up for the remainder of our trip to the city. Mark made a number of suggestions about places to see and visit and we tried them all. Not one was a disappointment, in fact they were all great. I did a personal guided tour of Moscow last year and that was also the best way to see the city. You can save a few Euros and go in a group, but if you really want to see the city in all it's \"lights\" then book Mark. One recommendation though is talk to him beforehand and let him know what you are looking for, he will sort it.Thanks Mark. If we ever come back to Amsterdam I know you would be happy to meet us for a beer!"

What he did not know, he e-mailed us later that day, such a thoughtful person.If you planning a visit to Amsterdam, this was my 4th visit, book a trip with Mark, we went for a private tour, highly recommended.

I had booked the previous evening online via Marks website, and received confirmation email straight away, which gave details of the tour meeting point which was easy to find. There were 8 people on the tour that evening, I think it's great that Mark limits the numbers to 10 people as it really does make a difference i.e. being able to gather round and hear all the information and there were plenty of opportunities to ask questions. We saw some other tour groups wandering round in groups of around 30! When we arrived in Amsterdam earlier in the day we did a brief walk around the RLD, and so had several questions and things we wanted find out about from the tour. Mark was able to provide all the information we had wanted plus more. Highly recommended!"

Both were awesome. We liked the smaller group size (which is capped at 10 people I think) which allowed for more communication within the group and also speedier tour with more stops and info. Mark was great - showed us some very interesting sights and taught us lots about the history etc of the city, architecture, policy, trade/finance and the RLD. Definitely recommend That Dam Guide - provides an invaluable and local perspective of the city and is far better than the large groups of 20+ people. Thanks Mark. All the best! -Adam and Jess"

I need to remember to keep this short and simple otherwise I will end up blabbing on for pages on just how much we appreciated this tour, Mark's time, and really that he made our Amsterdam trip one of the best cities ever visited, and leaving with that feeling 'I need to come back soon'. It was really unforgettable.He knew of the WWII tour we had previously done (and really enjoyed), and did a private tour with us weaving in the red light district, as well as a historical tour, and basically customized this really specific experience based on what he knew we were interested in, and the things he knew we couldn't miss. It was perfect, absolutely perfect. I could go on and on about all the things we learned, but what I can remember the most is the feeling I left with after the tour, feeling so enamored by the place, but also there were now so many more things we wanted to do and visit before we left. We ended up canceling the rest of our country list to spend more time in Amsterdam as a result, no regrets and was my favorite part of our vacation!We pretty much followed Mark's website for all our food and sightseeing needs and left with a feeling that we had gotten past the tourist layer, and was feeling like an Amsterdammer just getting a burger and meeting new friends on a Thursday night and going to our favorite pub for our usual tripel karmeliet. Really, we are lucky to have met Mark, and highly recommend this tour, any tour! Check out his website too, there are a lot of good recommendations for food/sightseeing/things currently going on. It ended up being kind of a one stop shop for us!All the best to you Mark!"

Mark knows a great amount about Amsterdam and it's way, he doesn't just give you that memorised script that most tour guides do. Mark has his own unique way of informing you of Amsterdam and it's interesting history. I have done a lot of tours throughout Europe and Mark's tour stands out without doubt. I would definitely recommend him to anyone who is wanting to find there way around Amsterdam and learn the ways. Well done Mark, you should be very proud of yourself and your achievements. All the best!"

The tour goes for 2.5 hours and goes around Amsterdam explaining the city's history and why it's like it is today!

If you are going to be in Amsterdam for a few days, I recommend going for Mark's tour first.

Despite having a larger than expected tour group (30 or so people), Mark battled on giving a detailed, entertaining and thorough tour of the city. He went to extra lengths to make sure everyone could hear what he was saying and that everyone was safe (it's hard to keep an eye in so many people around bikes and cars). I'd say this is a good tour to do on your first day in Amsetrrdam to give you a general idea of what the city has to offer - then you can explore further in your own.

His passion for the history of Amsterdam was clearly evident and made our experience better than we could have imagined. He was witty, helpful and respectful (even regarding some of the more colorful aspects of Amsterdam). I particularly liked that he made plenty of time for questions and you did not feel rushed like some of the other tours I've been on. Mark even spent time with our group after the tour had ended where he took us to a local pub for Stampot and marked our maps with other places to visit in Amsterdam. It was a genuine service and Mark clearly was happy to provide it. I highly recommend a tour with Mark. He's a damn good guide!!"

My wife and I travel frequently in Europe, and Amsterdam is one of our favorite cities.We are partial to small group walking tours because they generally offer a more intimate tour experience. Of the dozens of walking tours we have done over the years, I can honestly say that Mark's is the best. He possesses a vast knowledge of Amsterdam's history and culture, and he presents it in an amazingly entertaining and engaging manner. As a teacher, I quickly recognize those with an ability to connect with others. Mark certainly has that gift. Both on the city tour and the Red Light District tour, Mark keeps his audience fully engaged with his humor, intellect, and insight. His tours are also wonderfully unique because he loves his city deeply. This comes through clearly in the anecdotes and insider information that he shares with his tour participants. In every city one is typically presented with a vast array of options for touring. When in Amsterdam do yourself a favor and allow Mark to introduce you to his beautiful city. I assure you that you will be very happy you did."

He makes a great first impression as a really nice guy, and then proves to be knowledgeable, observant, humorous, and personable as well. The tour took us past some places we'd seen but knew nothing about - the old Dutch East India company, a market place - and I made sure I could always hear Mark's talks, because he always had interesting, historical information to impart. He talks knowledgeably and respectfully about all sides of life in Amsterdam (though is sensitive to his audience regarding drugs and prostitution, and was discreet!) and could answer any questions his group asked. Mark has talked to prostitutes about their lives, and I REALLY wanted to join his Red Light District tour that evening, but was unable to due to short time and family plans. I have no doubt that it's an excellent tour, though, given Mark's humane approach to this subject. We live in Europe, and I hope to visit again soon and take this tour with him. Our tour ended at a nice caf\u00e9, where Mark had a beer and made himself available to chat and answer questions. The kids and I enjoyed a snack there, and actually stopped by again later (with the kids' grandmother, too) so my husband could have a beer and we could all enjoy appetizers. Quite a decent place. If you have the chance, get to know Amsterdam with Mark Law with the orange pom pom on his hat: highly recommended!"

You can probably read about stuff before hand but you'll probably remember it better if you learn about it as you go through the area. We met our guide at Dam square and followed him for the next hour and half. The tour was a combination of walking and stopping to listen to our guide. He was a Italian guy called Stephano; very nice though a bit shy. He talked about the history behind prostitution in Amsterdam and then the explicit and implicit rules and regulation around the windows. We proceeded by visiting the world first condom shop (it was closed at the time of the tour) and then walked through an extremely narrow alley way which apparently had more expensive windows. At one point we passed by a live sex show place. There was a rope light going from outside of the place to the other side of the street. The lights were all red and our guide said it meant there was no seats available. At some point the lights turned green and it was a sign that there were seats available at the show. Later in the tour we stopped by the old church and heard about the interaction between the church and the prostitutes back in day. There was a kindergarten across from the church and right by some of the windows. Our guide mentioned at some point kids were asked about the windows and the best answer was that \"they sell kisses\"! The last stop was at a statue of a fictional prostitute called Belle."

After walking around for a bit we met up with the lovely twins and spend the bulk of the time with them. They are treasure trove of knowledge, not ashamed to answer any taboo questions (or condescending ones, as a lady in my group was prone to do), and quick with a joke. All locals and tourists should take advantage of this opportunity before they retire for real and their stories with them. The tour concluded at a sweet secret beer garden, where we got to sit down with Jan and the twins and really learn about the nitty gritty of hooking."

Would definitely recommend this tour if spending anytime in Amsterdam.(PS) My husband and I felt completely safe while waking around the district. This is a tour that would suit 18yr old and upwards.

For one, I learned that the Dutch established the stock market, and the building which they built to house it is still standing at present in the same spot, which is part of the Red Light District.I'd recommend taking the exclusive tour vs the non-exclusive tour so that you can really experience it!"

Took the 9pm tour, which this day was led by Jan.The total group was around 25 people, and Jan was exactly where the pre-tour emails said he'd be located, in the open plaza behind the royal palace. (just a few steps from the W hotel, for reference).The tour itself was fascinating and informative. Jan knows his city and its history, and he did a great job communicating it all clearly, despite the constant crowds. He was happy to answer questions, and threw in some great jokes and asides along the way. The 1.5 hour tour flew by, and we hated to have to go!As for the area itself, the RLD was in full swing already that night, but we never felt unsafe. Jan kept the group together nicely, and we just moved through and among the crowds like anyone else. Of course, there was beautiful scenery as well, if you catch my drift. But in all seriousness, you'll leave the tour with a much better understanding of the environment these women (and some men) work in, and how it all manages to work in such a cosmopolitan city.Highly recommended tour!"

Taking a red light tour with those that have been there for decades really helps shift your perspective. They share their insights and the reality of life in the district. The tour walks you through the area but really grounds it from their gaze. You certainly become aware of things I doubt other tours would even touch on. I would recommend this tour to anyone who wants to hear real voices of the red light district and get the hidden stories behind even the most mundane looking buildings."

What he really emphasized was the good treatment of the women. He was clear that they are there doing a job \u2013 and in most cases one they don\u2019t enjoy very much. The whole area, which is a pretty big size has \u201cwindows\u201d all over the main streets and down the small alleyways. We gained a whole new perspective for the industry and were glad we visited.

The time flew by even though we had been very tired from a very long day and my husband did not have particularly high expectations of the tour and was not particularly interested in the first place. Martin was an excellent guide. He started off with some trivia and essential history to contextualize the tour and the neighbourhood. He provided clear guidelines and was clearly very knowledgeable about the subject. He provided thought provoking information, was clear about his biases and his positions on things and provided clear disclaimers of what to expect and what not to expect. I would have spent another hour and a half learning more about things. The tour itself was very well varied, felt very safe and was a nice mixture of serious and fun. My only surprise was that I thought that the tour included entry to the Museum of Prostitution but it did not, it was only pointed out and we passed by it. I would suggest making that clear as to enter would be an extra cost and time obviously. Another thing that was not explicitly pointed out was the Hangover Information Center, which I would have liked to see. I would suggest being more intentional about this. Overall it was excellent, I would highly recommend it. I really appreciated the stories, the experience and the guide. Thanks! "

It was quite a large group on our day so you have to keep your eye on the guide as you weave in and out of alleyways - he said unlike other tour groups he refuses to hold up a flag/umbrella as many of the ladies in the windows will shut their curtains as soon as they see it!

Martijn was very friendly and gave some good info but really focused on drugs more than prostitution. Indeed, he was really advocating the benefits of weed and psychedelics over prescription drugs. We agreed with much of what he said about drugs, but he was strongly urging us to try mushrooms which seemed a little over the top. Again, we're not opposed, but chances are 70+ year old educated women are capable of making up their own minds about what they do or don't want to try. Also, he made somewhat disrespectful remarks about transgender people and didn't really seem to have much regard for sex workers. Eight years ago I was here and had a very educational tour in which the tour guide seemed respectful of the people he was discussing. I went on this tour b/c my travel companions had never been here before and I was disappointed. On the other hand, if you are more interested in the history and current practice regarding drugs, this is the tour for you."

It wasn't just about going to oggle the girls in the window but he told us so much about the history of the red light district that was interesting to learn. He kept the group engaged and made it fun and he also came out for a drink afterwards! Thanks Martijn, definitely recommend this tour to anyone visiting Amsterdam as you get to actually learn about the history of the area. From the aussies Alex and Luke"

I was expecting women who are socially viewed as \"beautiful\" i.e tall, slim, blonde etc. But I saw all sorts of women.....fat with cellulite, none blonde, short you name. This means there are men who go for these women and that explains why they are still in business. Conclusion: all women are worth it! Some of the best sex shops I've ever visited. .makes a very good shopping venue."

Having been to Amsterdam and the Red Light District before, but with a friend that hadn't, we were keen to learn about it more instead of just wandering through as I had done before. The tour was perfect as it gave us the history and let us ask all the questions to Jan when we wanted while we were looking round. We felt very safe while looking around and Jan was very approachable and happy to answer all our questions. This is the perfect tour to learn more about the Red Light District and get to know how it began and how it has evolved. Jan was the perfect tour guide and would highly recommend."

I loved that it started at 9pm, we had time to have our evening meal and then venture out all wrapped up for the tour, and being that time of night you see the red light district in full action! We had a lovely group of people on the tour which was great. Jan told us some history about the red light district along with showing us around, he even had his iPad to show us photos from a few decades before to show comparisons. There was also a secret church which you would never know was there unless you were told! The time flew by as it was great fun, Jan was very friendly and informative and was happy to answer any questions we had. The tour is suitable for couples, groups of friends or even solo travellers (we had a couple in our group).

Jan instantly put us at ease with his warm welcome and friendly demeanor. Despite the potential for awkwardness the evening actually turned out to be quite the opposite from start to finish. The RDL was busy but tame for anybody who's ever visited Bourbon Street or any college town during a sporting event. Jan mixed in entertaining facts about Dutch culture, politics and history plus he encouraged questions and even elicited responses from us to gauge our comfort levels on what we were experiencing that night. If you've ever been curious about Amsterdam and/or the RDL I strongly suggest booking with Amsterdam Red Light District Tours over any other tour operator."

I did all the research for you (hours of it over a month's time) and I promise this is THE tour to take - you will go places you would never find on your own and you will learn things only the locals could tell you! It's less like a tour and more like a friend showing you the most interesting parts of his city. For more details, keep reading....Let me start by saying, Amsterdam was the last stop (and this tour was on our last night) of a whirlwind European vacation with my sister that took us through 6 Italian cities, Belgium and Holland. In every city, we booked a tour. All of them very good and all of them different. Jan's red light district tour was far and away the BEST and most FUN we had in any city! You simply cannot go to Amsterdam and not check out the red light district. But, it was not something my sister and I were comfortable doing alone at night. I researched pretty much every red light tour on Trip Advisor and Yelp. I kept reading about how awesome Jan's tour was. They were right!! I can't imagine getting a better guide or tour anywhere else. Our tour group was small - the way we like it - with a total of 3 girls and one guy (plus Jan). Jan is a young guy with a great personality who really knows the city and everything about how the red light district operates. He took us through alleyways, past the infamous windows, we even checked out a peep-show (that's not mandatory, if you want to see it, you just get in a room, pop a Euro in the slot and the screen comes up for a minute). How many gals can say they squeezed into a peep show box with their sister in Amsterdam?! What's really great is if you walk past a store or see something interesting, Jan will stop and tell you about it. He will even go in with you - we ended up going inside the hangover remedy store! I don't want to give away all the secrets and fun you will have on this tour, but suffice it to say...you will not be disappointed! Jan even gave us a yummy gift! On a side note, we ran into him hours after the tour and asked where we could buy his hat (it's an ultra cool black hat with a red light bulb on it). He doesn't sell them, but offered the one off his head! He is so sweet. We didn't take it, mainly because it was chilly out and because my sister and I would have fought over it! I mention it to illustrate how nice and amazing Jan is. ENJOY!"

From a personal point of view, it was interesting to see the changes and the impact the Dutch government is having on the area. Our guide was excellent at answering our questions, keeping a good pace yet still ensuring we saw a good deal of the area.

I am so glad we did a nighttime tour with a guide because I am not sure I would want to wander around the Red Light District at night without a guide showing me where to go. Jan was great and very informative explaining the history and what is going on in the present. He made awkward topics funny and interesting and with such a small group we were able to wander around smaller alleys to see different places off the beaten path. Highly recommend this tour. Be sure to keep your mind open to different lifestyles!"

This tour was brilliant! Worth every penny!! Martin, our local guide, showed us the best, hidden places in the Red Light District. Within 1.5 hours he explained us how everything worked here. It was really fascinating! One of the best highlights was a visit to the last peep show in Holland. That was AWESOME! I learned a lot and this tour was definitely the best part of my visit to Amsterdam. Thanks guys!"

It was one of my favorite tours during my week in Amsterdam. Jan knows his history in regards to the district and he led our group (six tourists total, so we were lucky it was small) through streets, alleyways, and even through a brothel (!) that I NEVER would have wandered into on my own. It was a unique and eye-opening experience."

Book direct to avoid paying extra for the privilege of booking through an agency. You don't pay until the end. Trusting or what! We tpped and he was worth it.Martijn explains the historical background before walking you through the red light district (blue if you fancy trans gender sex). The area is crowded most nights but safe. And if you fancy Chinese food after, Chinatown is slap in the middle. First time I've walked right through a brothel! Plus you'll see Amsterdam's last peep show, first condom shop, sex shops that make Fifty Shades look tame, the live sex theatres and, of course, hundreds of windows populated by very pretty sex workers encouraging you in.Martijn also explores the background to the coffee shops and drugs industry. You probably end up being offered a drink and a smoke at the end of the tour.I felt 15 euro was a very fair price and would happily recommend. But you need to be broadminded and nonjudgmental. If you can't tick both these boxes,don't bother!"

He balanced the educational with the fun on our tour, letting us know all about the positives and potential negatives around the area's prostitution policies. He also talked through the coffee shops, smart shops, and sex-themed attractions in the area so no stone was left unturned. I loved this tour because it was very reasonably priced and the small group enabled us to interact and learn more. I can't imagine experiencing something like this in a big group tour, but I imagine it would be a big detractor. Also, Martijn is a blast to hang out with, which some of us did after the tour, in a great bar I doubt I would have found otherwise. As a side note, the area wasn't dodgy as I expected; it's actually one of the prettiest neighborhoods I walked through, and felt safe the whole time."

I fully recommend doing so as it feels more intimate and you can walk around more freely and hear what is being said.We had Jan as our tour guide who was interesting, funny and incredibly knowledgable. I think that because this is unique situation that it attracts many tourists wanting to view the women working and without this tour we would have missed so much and only focussed on the naked women. Jan was able to show us historical pictures to show what it was like in the past compared to now, which gave us a great perspective.I cannot recommend this tour company enough, by the end I had learned a great deal had many laughs and seen many things that will stay with me but more importantly I could go back again on my own and see things that many others could not. Book this on your first night and you will honestly not be disappointed. There may be other tours, but they won't offer you anything like what this company do!"

Me and my American friends wanted to know what the RLD was all about, therefor we decided to be guided by a local. So, we followed Viator's instructions to go meet the tour guide - Martin - on Friday night at nine o'clock at the National Monument. The tour started with an introduction and a brief history lesson, which was really interesting! After that, we walked through the district for 1.5 hours and Martin showed us everything we wanted to see; first condom shop in the world, the Old church, the window brothels, cannabis stores, hidden art, chinatown, and we even visited the last peep show in Holland; which was hilarious, haha! Martin was very knowledgable and really explained how everything works here; like safety measures for the ladies; free std-checks; registration at the Chamber of Commerce; taxes, rent for brothels, etc. After the tour, we hung out with Martin and treated him on some beers. Overall this tour was very informative, funny and above all; an unforgettable experience! Thanks Martin!"

Well obviously you can walk the red light district and have a look for yourself however the amount of information and the insight you learn on this tour was quite something of an eye opener (and I don't just mean the sights). The tour guide Carlos was very informative and funny and had the correct mix of providing a lot of information without feeling like being at school and keeping your intention with his (very bad) jokes and one liners. A very enjoyable experience, albeit I was disappointed with the visit to the museum of prostitution which I feel could really be skipped altogether, I certainly wouldn't pay to visit that on its own.

He was very knowledgeable about the history of Amsterdam, particularly with regard to drugs and the sex trade. His approach to sharing this information was comical and interesting, so you didn't feel like you were sitting in a history lecture, even though you were getting a lot of great information. It was one of the best things I did while visiting Amsterdam."

It ended up getting rained out the night of our tour, but the company was nice enough to move the tour to the following night.Overall the tour was very informative as Martin, our tour guide, shed light on the history prostitution in the city of Amsterdam. The tour included a brief 10 minute introduction outlining what we would see, and then for the next hour & 15 minutes, or so, Martin led us through the various alley -ways and local hot spots of the Red Light District, explaining stories and the Dutch laws. He even threw in hands on trip inside a brothel and peep show house.Overall, the tour was very educational and full of historical value as the Amsterdam Red Light District is a cultural experience unique to Holland. Concluding the tour, Martin also pointed many of the tourist in the direction of a very high quality coffee shop (not the liquid kind) that sold yummy treats, which made the experience even better!Top"

As I had not been any place like this before it was pretty intense.As far as the guiding the vibe of the tour was relaxed, felt a little like being guided through the district by a friend. Also included inseresting details and stories that should have otherwise been missed. After the tour Jan and Martjin went to a bar for some drinks and invited everyone who wanted to come along.

You'll stop outside the notorious \"coffee shops\" for a description of how they operate, walk inside a maze of red light windows, as well as have answered all your questions and curiosities. The guide Martin was upbeat and gleeful, hopping skipping and jumping his way around what clearly were streets familiar to him. He had a fun attitude, and was clearly an expert in the subject matter that is Amsterdam's drug and sex industry. Highly recommended as it is not the same as walking around, naturally lost, by yourself!"

An eye opening experience to the uninitiated! Amsterdam really has a libertarian way of life and does a big respectable job of keeping it in control. Martijn also gave us many insights and at the very end; an extra friendly cozy chat and chilling tutorial on the 'fun' and 'lively' life.

My husband and I were curious about the gay life too and he seemed to have a good knowledge of it as well. The tour even took us to peepshow. I've never been to one before and now I can say, I don't need to go again. At the end of the tour, our guide also accompanied a few of the group members to a coffee shop (look it up).

We decided to take this tour as we really did want to know more about the 'red light' district instead of just walking around feeling uncomfortable. Steven was a fabulous guide and told us lots of very interesting history and some of the more 'colourful' details that make the visit a must. He made us reflect on our own attitudes to legalised prostitution and legalised cannabis and explained some of those details that we would have been too embarrassed or would not think to ask. Good work Steven you made our visit worth remembering."

Our guide for the evening was Jan and he did an excellent job. He gave us a brief history of the area and pointed out the oldest buildings in the district as well as what some may consider to be the \"seamier\" aspects. Our tour was early in the evening and due to the fact that it was Remembrance Day in Holland so the district was quieter than normal. That did not detract, however and you could really get a feel for the area. We both felt safe walking the streets and Jan answered every question. You could tell that enjoys interacting with the tourists and giving them a behind-the-scenes look at the city."

My Wife and I decided to do this tour a little on the last-minute side and we signed up at the hop-on, hop-off bus/boat sightseeing tours main office just down the road from the central station. The tour was 25 Euro each but included just over two hours being walked around and free entry into the Museum of Prostitution. Our guide was a chap called Carlos who wore a little 'sexual-type' attachment on his finger so we could follow him easier. As we walked around we all loosened up and began to ask questions which was a tribute to Carlos who definitely put us all at our ease. This tour is definitely one in which to lose all your inhibitions as the more YOU put into it the more you will get out of it; no question/s are taboo and you would be amazed at what you learn and find out. You certainly get to go everywhere and see everything. If there was any drawback I would say that the visit to the Museum of Prostitution was quite short and felt a little rushed, it was very amusing to be taking a picture of my Wife in a red window though, especially when people waved back !!In short this was money well spent and a REALLY good evening just make sure you relax into it, lose the pre-conceptions and ask questions to get the most out of it."

While visiting Amsterdam for the first time, I knew that I HAD to check out the Red Light District, and obviously wanted to do this at night; however, because I was traveling alone, I was a little reluctant to do so having read some things online about the area that made me feel a bit uneasy. I decided that the best thing to do would be to take a tour, and I am so glad that I ended up finding THIS tour! My guide was Jan, the owner of the company, who is very nice and down-to-earth guy. I originally had booked a 7:30 pm tour but it was changed to 9:00 pm. I thought about backing out after the time change, but am so glad I didn't because the 9:00 pm tour is definitely the way to go in order to get the full \"Red Light District\" effect. Jan was very knowledgeable and walked us by several key spots in the area, including one of the founding coffee shops, some brothels, Chinatown, and a Peepshow. The tour really gave me a sense of comfort with the area, so much so that I returned the next day alone and had lunch at a Thai Restaurant in Chinatown (Bird) that Jan recommended, which by the way is AMAZING!! Do yourself a favor and check out this tour! It was only 15\u20ac for a basic 90-minute walking tour, and the information that you get alone is worth every penny!!"

We noticed reviews of this tour business on tripadvisor, went on their website, and decided to give it a shot while we were in town. Jan was our tour guide who is the owner of the business - a younger, unassuming guy, very down to earth. It was 20 EUR per person for 1.5 hour private tour option in the late afternoon - we felt this was a very reasonable deal upon conclusion of the tour. He was prompt and met us exactly as communicated in advance. The experience was kind of like walking around with a friend; he gave us some historical commentary and amusing anecdotes, and also pointed out interesting and noteworthy locations. He was perfectly professional and polite, not sleazy or cheesy. The only odd thing he included on our tour was a stop at a doll museum, which just felt like an odd destination to make a deliberate 5 minute stop (does he get a kick-back for bringing tourists in there?). We did run into the famous \"old prostitutes\" there though which made it memorable. Recommend this tour company."

I visited Amsterdam with my brother in March 2015 and before we left we booked tour over the internet with this company after comparing prices and reviews etc. We were NOT dissapointed! We were met at the monument at Dam Square, as agreed, by Jan. Jan was lovely, very friendly and down to earth and as my brother and I were the only ones on the tour that night (it was a Sunday) we had the opportunity to ask a local what the city was really like. Jan was very informative, full of historical facts, recommendations and local knowledge, which enriched our tour and subsequently our time in Amsterdam immensely. He started off with a brief history of the city and then we set off. At all times Jan was happy to stop and answer any questions we had, have a laugh and a joke with us, point out things we'd never have noticed and took us to see things we would never have seen otherwise. He really does show you the red light district at it's best. For those thinking it's all drugs and prostitutes, a lot has changed in recent years to make it better, cleaner and safer for all involved. Being it was just the three of us and there were a lot of stags parties around, I thought I might have felt threatened and intimidated by the whole thing but I couldn't have been more wrong. Jan helped us feel at ease and safe and encourage us to experience the area fully, and I'm glad we did. If we hadn't been with a guide I don't think we'd have plucked up the courage to even go at night. If you have any worries or reservations, definitely go with this tour company, you will be made to feel comfortable and at home in what can seem like a strange, alien world.Thanks Jan!"

Saw women in red lit windows in narrow streets, but also shops with nick-nacks, nice design and fashion shops.In a bonbon shop we bought hand made sweets. We went to Mata Hari for dinner, a hip restaurant. Good food too. During this 1.5 hours I burned a lot of calories as well. Healthy stuff that walking tour! :-) LIKE ! \""

Altough i life in Amsterdam the tour guy named Jan surprised me and my friends with his knowledge about the history of Amsterdam in general as specific about the Redlight District. During the walking tour he tells abouth the history, public figures, well known prostitutes, gangsters, residents and governmental issues and plans. Besides that he brings you to places you would never find on your own. Great tour!"

Our local guide was very knowledgeable on the culture and history of the district, answering all our questions and the tour flew by as we took in the sights making our way through the narrow streets. Our guide helped us find some good spots for us to take some pretty funny photos which was great! Once the tour was over our guide led us to a good watering hole and we shared a few drinks - a great and late night in the end! I'll be recommending this tour to friends visiting this amazing city in future. Thanks again!"

It is always great to have a local guide with you, but especially in an area such as the Red Light District in Amsterdam. He told us so many interesting stuff about history, prostitution, drug policy, fun facts, do's and don'ts, the current situation, etc. Things you won't find in your standard city guides! Also, he pointed out which bars and restaurants the locals like to go to, something I always appreciate :-)\u2026I'd definitely recommend this tour, as you'll have a whole other mindset of the Red Light District after doing this tour."

This was not my first visit to Amsterdam and I do know my way around but I did learn many things.Jan our guide was very knowledgeable and clearly passionate about this great city and of course the red light district (RDL). I really enjoyed learning about the history of the city, the origins of the RLD, religion and tolerance. The tour started at Dam Square and we headed into the RDL via Warmoesstraat with some interesting facts shared along the way. The highlight of the tour of course were the beautiful window girls in De Wallen. Jan took us up and down the main RDL strip including, Oudezijds Voorburgwal and Oudezijds Achterburgwal. We visited the Sex Palace Peep Show, De Oude Kerk (The Old Church) and the Waag in Nieuwmarkt and again along the way Jan explained the History and the changes that have been made to the RDL over the past 10 years.I really enjoyed this tour and its well worth the money. If its your first time visiting Amsterdam then I highly recommend it. The RDL is a relatively safe area but having a guide take you through the alleys does put your mind and ease. The RDL is a rapidly changing place with many windows and facilities being closed down so book this tour while you still can and enjoy some of Amsterdam's more colourful and erotic history."

You learn about art and architecture, canals and culture while being guided through the busy streets of the city.

However, I managed ok even though the tour was hitting the 3 hour mark. I do recommend comfy shoes, especially on a hot day. It is important to bear in mind that these tour guides live off the tips you give and it is recommended that you pay about \u20ac10. I feel that this is a bargain for the insight and information you are given. Don't tip less just because there might be a group of 20+ and you think you can get away with it - not good karma!!"

We circled the market meeting area twice before finding the guide who was holding a binder that said City Free Tour. To be fair, we were a tad early. The information along the tour was interesting, a good intro to Amsterdam and with a joke thrown in here and there. My only complaint is I can do 2.5 hours of walking, but we would actually walk a bit then stand still while the guide talked about the area we were in. By the end of the tour, everyone was looking for places to sit when we stopped. I'm in my late 20s and my lower back was not happy. That being said, the tour itself is worth it if you are ok with the hike. The guides work purely on tips so we brought about 10 euro per person for her at the end. Recommended!"

I had a large group so emailed Monique prior to arriving and unreal how many times she emailed me to answer many of my questions; and the help she gave me re. planning our 3 days in Amsterdam; way beyond the call of duty. Re. the walking tour; she set it up for just my group at specific time; had three guides and afterwards; all my group were fighting for the rights that their guide was the best. They all gave 100 %plus. They were all fabulous; knowledgeable, enthusiastic, educated; and fun to be with. This tour is a MUST to do in Amsterdam; best to do it shortly after you arrive; gives a good layout of the land plus you pick up a lot of hints for the rest of your time in Amsterdam. I have taken many other free tours in other places and this one rates the highest. You will see so many things that a travel book will never tell you to see; so many hidden spots and fabulous history of Amsterdam. All the guides had strong voices plus were very considerate of people in their group .. re. walking ability; needing a break; time to take pictures ,etc. Plus they all gave excellent tips on what to do for the remainder of our stay; where to eat, drink; avoid lines for certain things, etc. I feel bad that they don't make the tip mandatory as it's well worth 15 E per person for three hours. Monique also helped us plan dinner/drinks for 6 in a beautiful castle like restaurant where the guides met us at 8 to do the Red light District Tour. How interesting; eye opening, plus safe that was ; having a guide with us plus learned a lot about prostitution. Again fabulous guides , information and so much fun. This tour is offered also; if you just show up at their recommended spot; also easy to find. The suggested tip for the Red Light tour at night is a bit less as it's only 2 hours. They are so kind; they even walk you back to where you get on the subway to your hotel. Will not find a better company, guides or tour than these ones. Make sure you take both of them if you can."

It gave us a base knowledge to appreciate things about city as we explored it on our own after. We were lucky to make good friends with the other two tourists who we met every day and made it a brilliant break. The tour has no price, you give the guide a payment of your choice at the end."

Her knowledge, her communications skills, her story telling and her sense of humour also added to our experience. This tour provides participants with historical facts, tips and tricks in experiencing and navigating Amsterdam, information on architecture (why are some of the buildings leaning?), some insight on Amsterdam culture and much more. This was an enlightening tour with an amazing tour guide. Happy adventures in Amsterdam!"

We were a small group on the day and our guide Monique, gave us a long stroll along the canals of Amsterdam and the core of the city center. She explained the history, the construction and the habits (some funny facts as well) of Amsterdam and its people over time. I recommend it to anyone who interested to get a closer look to the culture and history of this beautiful city. Well done Monique!"

The tour is created to show the visitors little bit of the history of this great and somewhat unusual city. The tour will go through Red Light district but its still suitable for children. The tour is free, but the guides do appreciate tips, and usually is 10euros/person. Be aware the walk tour is 2.5 hours long rain or shine, and you should reserve it via website"

As part of the holiday we chose a private walking tour of Amsterdam (so it wasn't \"free\"). Monique was our guide - she was excellent! Friendly, informative, amusing & helpful. We agreed to meet in a local cafe ( \"Vinnies\") for a coffee where we discussed what we wanted from the event and so it was a \"normal\" tourist tour (omitting Anne Frank's house since we were visiting there the next day). We certainly enjoyed a snack & refreshment afterwards!During our walk of 3 hours (?) we stopped frequently to re-group / take photos & we had coffee! Our tour (& Monique) was that good we arranged to meet again a couple of days later for a slightly \"alternative\" view of Amsterdam! We met behind Central Station by the ferry before crossing the water to \"North Amsterdam\". I really enjoyed this rather fleeting visit to see the former dockyard with its submarine / new wave / retro / alternative lifestyle - although it should be said that one or two in our group weren't impressed! The free ferry also gave us some good views of Amsterdam & its architecture from a different perspective. It was then back to Central Station & a tour around the Jordaan area (pity the \"hidden\" courtyards were closed!).Highly recommended - furthermore, although I can't make a direct comparison, we were glad that we hadn't opted for an organised cycle tour. We knew there would be a lot of bikes but the place is heaving with them! so a group touring round could have been a bit fraught! In any case the touristy parts of the city are close to each other & easily walkable"

We'd wasted \u20ac14 each on one of the dull, tourist-baiting canal cruise tours the previous day. This walking tour, however, proved that Amsterdam is a very interesting and vibrant city after all, and was a brilliant way to spend a couple of hours of an afternoon (not least because you get to visit an AMAZING cheese shop on the way round where you can try a variety of unbelievably delicious Dutch cheeses!).

I was really surprised when I got to know about this free tour concept and I must say the tour was amazing.. The tour guide was very friendly and humorous person herself and made the tour super interesting with all the amazing and funny facts about the city. I could not expect anything more in a 2 hr tour. I highly recommend City free tour for anyone visiting Amsterdam and wish to get the flavor of the city.. Thanks for the amazing tour!"

I liked the tour very much; Monique is an experienced guide with a warm personality and it was extremely beneficial hearing about historic anecdotes this city had to give.The tour helped me not to look at map to find out where i am, but to orientate based on little excerpts from the tour.We visited most of important cultural and historic places, but what i liked most isn't the factual and dull historical data, but the stories that were following these facts. The other side of the history, so to say.I would also like to point out that the tour lasted longer than average, and this felt like a good bonus.This helped me learn more about the city, canals, its citizen and to share this knowledge back home.I definitely recommend this tour to anyone interested in original, fun, but also factual and precise tour of the city core."

One thing for certain to is that when you travel there an umbrella is a necessity as it will rain at point on the trip.It is quite easy to get around the city and walking is highly advised and maybe a bike rental for the day. The inner square is where the main crowds gather in the hustle bustle day to day activity and is close to main attractions and the circular maze-like streets.. Rijiks museum,and its shiny wooden floors houses a wonderful collection of Dutch masters artists and the awesome larger than life painting of Rembrant's \"Night watch\" will take one's breath away! Anne Frank huis is also not far and has a lot of memorabilia from WW2 era. One of the best attractions is the Artis zoo, its the oldest in all of Euroland (since 1838)and has quite unique exhibit displays of native and rare specimens. Madurodan a tiny replica of the city in miniature is located some distance from center town is quite a delight for children as well as adults. The outdoor air and light museum surrounded by wind mills is also worth a visit as is the Keukenhof tulip gardens a showy display of all sorts of the gorgeous imperial bulb. Crafts of wood and delft dishware are good buys as well as umbrellas!. One rare yet pleasant sunny afternoon we walked with our child in the comfy stroller all around the city and in no time the fresh air and walk brought on a restful sleep, so we were able to enjoy the city in full, the canals all lit up at night,having a rice table ristafel meal, and walking to the outer river bank and glimpsing the huge North sea in the distance and appreciating just how amazing a tiny city like it can be,indeed."

She gave good explanation of the city history, Dutch mentality, architecture, Dutch names and more. She brought us to places only the locals would know.

It went for over 2 hours but we didn't walk far. It would have been great to be able to sit down more as standing for long periods was tough on the kids. The 10 year old tuned in and out but our older 2 children really enjoyed it. We tasted some delicious cheese and saw where all the important places were to go back to after. Highly recommended."

The tour itself takes between 2 and 2:5 hrs and is packed with interest.Toilets are available at the start point - the distance walked is not great and there are plenty of rest stops.We learnt about the Royal Palace, the Jirdaan Area, the bridges, canals, houses, traders, maritime history all fascinating.Moving on we discovered Amsterdam's old river routes, how the city was formed and developed - it's Catholic and Protestant history.Sergio took us to the Jewish quarter (although not Ann Franks House) - we were shown pictures and informed of those dark days when hundreds of thousands of Dutch Jews were deported.Next was the old town walls, tax collections, the Cannibis Cafes et al followed by the red-light area..and yes the girls were still working in the morning ! Your guide will take you through the fascinating history of the area.You finish were you began at the Coffee Shop - now the tour is titled \"Free\" and it is you could just walk away with a thank you....however we gave \u20ac15 each other's \u20ac10 or 20 it is entirely up to you.The tour was great and we think a must for all visitors to better understand Amsterdam :)."

However, if you are looking for a guided tour that will let you know a bit more about those crooked narrow buildings and the reason why the opera house does not match the rest of the city, this is a great alternative. The guide is very friendly and tries to make the 2 hour walk really amusing, and you can get to know other tourists while you are it. The tour is free (although they expect a tip for their effort and in the website they suggest something around 10 EUR). I would highly recommend this for people in their first visit to Amsterdam."

A fun detail for exmaple; I loved the fact she sometimes asked us some questions (about a statue for example) -which we never had the right answer to- and then started telling more about the actual answer, it makes you a part of the tour instead of just a listener. It also surprised me how she had clear, fun answers to lots of things I always questioned about Amsterdam, it showed how much she knows the city, not just the tour.

It is progressive and our guide was able to explain to us how the evolution of the Netherlands lends to such forward-thinking. We travelled as a young couple, however, be aware if you are slightly prudish or travelling with children that the tour does take you to various parts of the red light district.

So nice with a guided tour, that did'nt list up year after year, and then repeated it in 3 more languages! Loved the small anecdotes, giving a twisted angel, but a far better understanding of the city of Amsterdam and its tolerant citizens with their intollerant kamikaze-bikers. On behalf of Nathalie, Daniel and me: A big \"Thank You\" to Monique!"

Rather then walking around a city we have never visited we took a free walking tour of the old city near the river .It was easy walking and very informative. The guide was great and pointed out many old areas and buildings .We got to stroll thru the red light district in the afternoon. There are over 300 prostitutes sitting in front windows strutting their bodies. If the drapes were closed she was busy. There are cafes on every corner that sell pot with a drink. It, s all legal and I guess closely watched. You could high just stopping at every caf\u00e9 and taking a deep breath. There are old taverns that sell many varieties of beer in that area. I was good experience and gave you and ease of mind in a so called seedy area."

A friendly guide, who took us around the main parts of central Amsterdam, with a good slug of history and local knowledge put in. The only thing I felt this tour/guide was lacking a little bit was some of the local knowledge that's useful for tourists - where are his favorite restaurants, any nice cafes / bars / coffee shops or whatever that only the locals know about, etc etc. But definitely worth going to all the same!"

If one has not come to Amsterdam just for the weed and the sex, City Free Tour Amsterdam is one of the best methods to explore the city. Just hop on with one of them and they will get you to love Amsterdam !Hi-fives to these people who do it for free and leave it upto you for your contributions.

We had a very entertaining and humorous walking tour of Amsterdam with Rik who is clearly very passionate about his home town.The customer service started the day before when we tried to first book. We were told that the tour was booked out but that the organisation would get back to us if they decided to run a second tour. Sure enough, Monique called back an hour or so later and confirmed our place on a second tour.The tour started on time with Rik and Tjis dividing up the walkers into two appropriately sized groups of around 15 people in each group.Rik's patter covered everything from history and mythology, to street art and the characteristics of the people of Amsterdam. In particular, he handled the potentially awkward topic of the business in the red-light district with humour and tact. Questions prompted often humorous and witty answers. One thing we have noticed over the years is that some tour groups can be discourteous and crowd out people who are already there; this happened frequently in Berlin when we would be looking at a monument or feature only to have a tour leader walk in, stand in front of us and start on his speech completely ignoring that we were already there. Rik took care to ensure that our tour did not interfere with other groups and individuals. Rik was also good in ensuring the safety of the walkers with regards to avoiding the ever present cyclists of Amsterdam. Ideally this tour is probably best taken on your arrival in Amsterdam. The question of how much to pay for the tour was handled honestly by Rik and basically amounted to what value you gave the tour. He drew comparisons between other tours and the amounts paid for them.People in our group paid between 10-20 Euros per person with the exception of two young female adults who snuck off without paying. Not good form!"

            "review": "Well done!. On Saturday, April 25, 2015 we had a 13 hour layover in Amsterdam before flying to Dublin. We decided to take advantage of our brief time in this most interesting City. After reading about the City Free Tour Amsterdam on Trip Advisor, we booked the 'Tip-based Classic Walk' tour a few days ahead online through the company website link and promptly received a confirmation and all the information we needed to meet up with and find the tour, including tips on wearing warm clothing, having some rain protection and good walking shoes. It was a warm, welcoming and professional confirmation letter that was very much appreciated.After a long overseas night flight and arriving in Amsterdam around 6:30 a.m., we ended up having leisurely coffee and exploring the nicely laid out Schiphol Airport for awhile, deposited our carry-on bags at our nearby airport hotel (Radisson Park Plaza) we'd pre-arranged and taxied to Dam Square to meet our tour which assembled around 11:15 a.m. for the 11:30 tour. It was so very tempting to stay and rest at the hotel, but we carried on and are very happy we did.Kim was our very personable and articulate guide and took the time to first have some casual introductions as to where everyone was from. It was a very informative tour and the pace was just perfect. We had a few countries represented in our group of about 15 (+ or -), which was very nice. It was a couple of enjoyable and entertaining hours that seemed to fly by.The City is vibrant and so historically interesting that unless one was visiting for some time, it would be impossible to see all it has to offer in the very short time that we were there. We were thrilled that we could have the opportunity to partake in such a excellent tour that covered so many highlights in a casual, fun and educational way.As we had a special taxi rate arranged through the airport hotel, Kim took the time at the end of the tour to call them for us on her cell phone as well as making restaurant suggestions nearby. The guides work hard (and have fun) and are definitely deserving of their time and enthusiasm in being tipped appropriately.We would highly recommend this great tour for anyone visiting that wants to have a little more insight into the history of the beautiful City of Amsterdam. Thanks, Kim!"

The time is not too early and not too late. I would say it is perfect. It is a walking tour and it lasts for around 2 hours, it ends around 14:00pm. It is very funny and the guides know how to engage the people.MAIN ATTRACTIONS:In this tour you will visit the Red Light District, the Chinatown of Amsterdam, the old Jew District, the Nieuwmarkt, the Dam Square and you finish at the Homomonument. You'll pass through different districts and you'll notice the difference between older and newer buildings and how the city is changing.STORY:The story presented by the guide is divided in 3 main periods \"so that you won't have to try to remember date you'll forget anyway\" :) . And the tour is organized in such a way that you go through each period one after another along the path and you won't get confused. Here a few topics of the different stories: the \"horny\" sailors, the red light district, Multatuli, the inclined buildings, chinatown, De Waag, the dutch \"original\" naming method for everything etc...STAFF:Our guide, Sarah, was so nice. She told us a lot of stories about the city, all very interesting. She told us some places to eat something good and also the main events that were going to occur in those days. She even told us how much is an apartment in Amsterdam center per meter square (of course someone asked her). To tell how good was the tour I can say that I still remember almost everything after one week (I already forgot what I ate yesterday!! Just saying).TIPS:Try to ask how to say \"88 beautiful canals\" in ducth. For a not-dutch person it is almost impossible! :) .You tour is free so you don't have to pay...but the truth is that you'll give money anyway. So here another tip: pay the lunch to your guide :) . You'll pass some more time listening to other stories.I did not follow other tour so I cannot actually compare with others.But for me it still remains a MUST DO experience in Amsterdam."

And he made multiple suggestions on other things we would enjoy."

Still, it felt like a basic tour, not very personal or individual, nothing special. Our group of 8 was split up, the other half of the group was way more satisfied. Apparently it depends strongly on which guide will tour you around."

Our guide, Tijs, added historical and cultural background that made the cityscape come to life, and took us to some scenic backstreets that I wouldn't have found on my own. The distance, pace, and route were all good. The company is good about keeping groups to about 20 people max (about the largest group that works well with this walking tour format) -- if they get more people than that, they bring in another guide and form an additional group. (Note that while there's no fee for the tour, you should plan on tipping the guide.)"

Our guide was both informative and amusing and luckily about 6 foot 6, which was a bonus when it came to the busier streets. The group wasn't too big so everyone could hear and there was a good mix of ages and nationalities. Online booking is expected, but there was a couple who hadn't booked that came along."

We were given information about Amsterdam going back hundreds of years. We were taken to places we had not heard of e.g The Church In The Attic. We were given advice on how much we should pay for things and were the best coffee shops and cheese shops are. We were not sold anything. Its advice you can take or leave. We walked around with people from all over the world and we all got chatting. At the end of the walk (which was about 2hrs) you pay your guide what you think the tour is worth and there is no pressure to pay anything. All of the people on our tour gladly paid. It also helps you get your bearings if your a first time visitor to the city. We have decided that we will look for these tours whenever we go on a city break."

I was initially concerned at the large number of attendees, so was pleased when we were split into two groups of approx. 15. Tijs is a native of Amsterdam, and clearly knows the city well. His spoken English is very good and he was very approachable throughout the afternoon. The tour was a combination of the more obvious landmarks (e.g. Dam Square, the Red Light district), but also took in some less known locations that could easily be overlooked by the independent traveller. Tijs' commentary was an interesting blend of history and current issues, which certainly brought the city to life. I'd definitely recommend this tour to anyone who wants to find their feet in Amsterdam."

Replies were friendly and prompt.The tour itself- took in all the major sights and boroughs of the Dam. Tour guide was personable, friendly, very knowledgeable about the city and clearly in love with it! She provided many interesting facts about the city and kept all three of us interested for the entire tour. The tour was paced well, and didn't feel boring or rushed at any point.I went with a friend who has been living in the dam for 8 weeks; she has been on the bus and canal tour, and says this tour was the best of all!Well done city tours and thanks for a great introduction to an awesome city!"

Monique did a very nice job explaining everything to us during this (free- tip based) two hour walking tour. It was not at all hurried nor were you talked down to as in some I've attended. Monique tried to put you into the flavor and attitude of the city. Her English was very adequate, we began in the Jewish section and ended up at the Royal Palace. Ask her for restaurant recommendations too!"

I would recommend doing it first on your trip because you can get some great ideas of places you'd like to visit. The tour took just over 3 hours with pretty relaxed walking and covered I think almost all of the older city. We went on a busy Saturday in a full tour (40 people) and they mentioned that you can reserve spots online because if you get there and all the spots are taken up then you're out of luck."

It was a perfect amount of time (2 hour walk), and the meeting location was easy to find. I would recommend this walk to anyone visiting Amsterdam as a nice introduction to the city to get a feel about where things are because once you go through the city, it's small enough that you can roam around comfortably. With the tour, the benefit is is that things will look familiar and you won't be reliant with a map."

I took the tram and met up with our tour guide outside the flea market (got some well priced souvenirs here) and off we went. The tour is about 3 hours and it was very comprehensive and great. The only thing I noticed was that we didn't stop by the Anne Frank Huis (this was the day after). I didn't actually notice during the tour because we covered so much in that short period of time. I was able to walk around Amsterdam on my own and find my way around easily. Very colourful stories from our tour guide. Tipping is optional but appreciated. I'd do this tour again if I'm in Amsterdam."

You would think that it would be short and not very informative but this is not the case as you could clearly see that our guide (Kendra) really loves the city and this came across through a in depth, passionate guide through the history and modern day Amsterdam. I advise you to do this as soon as you arrive as you can then pick out key points of interest that you can come back and visit at your own leisure. The tour guide doesn't get paid for what they do instead working on a tips basis but they do not badger you at any point for money purely doing it for the love of the job!"

The tour covers most old town sights, and the guide really knows the town. And if you ask him, he will tell you many more. If you are running low on time, or just need a brief introduction to the City before you dive in, this is an excellent choice. As contained in the notice - weather can be unpredictable - bad weather can ruin some fun, especially when it comes to windy winter rain. So perhaps choose this attraction in a different season will enhance the experience."

It was a little hard to spot our guide since she didn't wore any badge or sign to tell she was a guide from City free tours. This was one of the first tour she had. Polite and friendly, but obviously still under training. I have no dont that the tour will be great after a period of training, but for now the quality was above average. We received little information about the different sites, and thus the sites picked out seemed less interesting. The whole tour takes 1,45 minutes. Reading other reviews it is obviously our tour suffered from the lack of a properly trained guide, but I still give it average since we where noted that we would have a new guide. And she was very friendly and will probably be a great guide after a while. The tour is free, but you still end up giving tip close to what other companies would take. Or at least we do."

With that said, we all have different wants, needs and energy levels. We came upon City Free and couldn't have been more pleased. Raphael, our leader, arrived promptly and was most informative. We had all done a lot of walking tours and what was especially great was that he was willing to deviate if there was something more specific we were interested in. Perhaps, even better was that if there was a monument and/or subject he was not aware of, he told. us. If I recall we booked Raphael for 3 hours, which for us was perfect. We got to experience the public transportation, walking throughout many districts so we knew where we wanted to return to. I also think Raphael could adjust the tour to any age group so don't let the fact that we might have been a little on the slow walking side deter you. Raphael made up in energy, gently pushing us along.Go to Amsterdam! Tour with City Free! We had a great time."

Overall I thought it was average and definitely enjoyed the Canal tour more....Expect to tip at the end of the tour."

He also took great pictures of us all for us to remember the trip!I really didn't have the energy to do the research for my in-laws trip. I very much recommend this company if you would like to see Holland and not have to organize anything, read one guide book and recieve 5 star treatment in return. Thanks Tom!

Touring Holland provides you some amazing sights such as windmills, canals, polders, flowers particularly daffodils, artwork, a variety of cheese and landscape. The healthy beautiful cows grazing in the well-preserved neat and clean lush green fields attract our attention, and wide open the secrets of its highly reputed and admired cheese of various taste and sizes. The countryside is remarkably attractive, and we were thrilled to view inside a windmill the utensils, the machine used for fetching the water through the wheel, and the history visualized through their antique craftsmanship. The ladies attending the visitors explained to us how windmills have always played a great part in the life of Holland and its inhabitants. They served to grind corn, to remove excess water from the low-lying districts, and to saw timber, thus making the country fit for human habitation and adding to the habitable area, they developed - especially in the seventeenth century - into a most important factor in the social structure of those days. The tour was fruitful, helpful, wonderful and delightful."

The first tour was a 2 hour walking tour of the Red Light District with Marco and he was absolutely lovely, extremely knowledgable, fun and very interesting. The second tour was with Henk who took us on a full day personalised tour of the countryside north of Amsterdam including Marken, Edam, Monnickendam and much more. Henk was just simply wonderful, he catered for our every request. The car was extremely comfortable, perfectly clean and we were provided with snacks and drinks. Nothing was too much trouble for Henk and he was unbelievably knowledgeable and interesting. The third tour was another personalised tour of The Hague, Deft (just gorgeous) and Voorschoten. We particularly wanted this to be a special day for Mum who hadnt been back to her place of birth for over 60 years. From the first enquiry to saying goodbye, our experience with Toms Travel Tours was outstanding and I highly recommend them."

As part of a 4-day visit to Amsterdam on our way to a photo safari in Tanzania, 5 of us booked Tom's Tours to take us out of Amsterdam for a day of photography in the countryside. Although Tom is a photographer, he was not available due to his own travel schedule. But he sent us Carin for a wonderful day of grand photo ops.We appreciated her knowledge of the area, her understanding of our desire to get off the beaten path while still capturing some of the iconic Netherlands views (yes, windmills, canals and polders), and her patience with our repeated stops to get yet one more photo of the reflection in the canal or the cows in the fields.Tom was very responsive with timely (considering 9 hours time difference) to my questions in a series of emails as we shaped the day in consultation with the others in the group. He and Carin exceeded expectations and provided us with a much better day than we could have had on our own or in a bus tour with non-photographers."

We were picked up on time at our hotel by Carin, who was our driver/tour guide for the day. As she took us to all the places we had requested she was also giving us a history lesson of the Netherlands. After a very enjoyable day with Carin, we were dropped off to tour the Anne Frank House. From there we walked to the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 for dinner. Tom met us there at a pre-determined time to take us on a tour of the Red Light District. After a very through tour and history lesson we were returned to our hotel.We have done private tours of many cities around the world and highly recommend Toms Travel Tours as one of the best!"

I gave a 5 star rating because Trip Advisor won't allow 6!We wanted to see more of Amsterdam than just the center and Tom delivered. We wanted a focus on the food and beer and some of the neighborhoods.Highlights of the tour (in chronological order) Vondelpark, Near in Western Neighborhoods, Jordaan and some 'secret' courtyards, a stop at the open air market by the North Church (and stocking up on cheese, charcuterie, bread, olives and fruit for a picnic); a nice picnic along the water on one of the '3 islands'; riding through the crowds by the central station (ok, not the best part ;) ); taking a ferry to North Amsterdam; riding through a large North Amsterdam park - hard to believe we were that close to the center; riding along one of the dikes and the 17th century houses built along it (google Caf\u00e9 t Sluisje to get an idea where we were); crossing the locks to get back into the city: some tasty - and well earned - beers at Brouwerij t' iJ. (Very good beers and a cool place); and a quick ride back to the start while passing the zoo.Tom customized this tour for what we wanted to see and he delivered. In addition to a bike guide, we got a lot of great history and information and some awesome photos too. My wife booked the tour and I had no idea that we would get Tom or that he is a professional photographer. Amazing pictures! In some of the more crowded places, I felt like we were some unknown celebrities with our own private photo crew chronicling our journey.If you want to see Amsterdam and the area in an in-depth, customized and private way, I highly recommend Tom and will send all of my friends to him. We travel a lot and this was one of the best tours ever!"

Having investigated via TA and other sources as to the best options for a private tour guide company in Amsterdam, we choose Toms Travel Tours. It was our best decision of the whole summer holiday! On the first day in Amsterdam we did a walking tour of the city with Simon. Simon was just great. As a couple of our children are quite young, we did not want to yet expose them to certain aspects of Amsterdam, and Simon did a GREAT job showing us everything but whilst staying off the streets where a few uncomfortable questions may have been asked of us by our younger children. Simon kept it interesting during the whole tour, even for the younger children, constantly asking them questions to keep them on track.The following day, we did a whole day trip with Chris to visit the surrounding villages and windmills. Chris is incredible. He arranged to go cycling, with some great local snacks and refreshments along the way, followed by a visit to a cheese factory, and a wooden clog traditional factory where one of the very few traditional clog makers left in the world expertly showed us how to make them. The visit to the windmills was our last stop, and the highlight of the day. Chris is incredibly knowledgeable of the history and geography of the area, and made it interesting all along the way both for the adults and the children.We could not recommend Toms Travel Tours higher. Perfect organisation, and fantastic tour guides."

We were so pleased with our excellent tours of the Dutch Countryside with Carin, Amsterdam Walking Tour with Saskia, and a custom tour of Friesland that Tom arranged and guided for us. We felt like we saw so much of the Netherlands in our very short stay, and the pace was perfect for our group (despite the complications of young children and limited mobility). We were especially grateful with the special arrangements and details that Tom gave to our beautiful tour of Friesland to St. Anna Parochie and Leeuwarden, where our family history in the Netherlands began. Tom also shared with us some lovely portraits of our group shortly after our tour. Thank you for making our visit to the Netherlands so unique and special!"

Although he was knowledgeable and friendly he did not relate well with the age group (seniors). He did not take us inside any buildings and left us for lunch at a very unacceptable caf\u00e9. The second day was a travel day with Karen to The Hague. Karen was marvelous. We enjoyed the tour due mainly to Karen's obvious experience and her enthusiasm. Thank you Karen."

Me and Mother wanted a private tour in the dutch countryside because with a public tour you are very time bound and don't get much freedom to see the beauty in the small towns and villages in the dutch countryside. Tom provided us a perfect tour. He was very quick with his replies in email, knew everything about the area and also about many other places (good source to plan your next trip), and made us a tour where we could relax and see everything! He also knew the place where you find less crowded Windmills to see and take pictures. I don't think anyone else could even come close to proving a great tour like he did."

The tour had a little of everything Dutch: cheese, windmill, dikes. Too bad we were late for tulips season. Karen made sure that we did not only take in the sights but also the culture, the history, the people, food, and current events. Since our trip was cut short, we will certainly go back and call Tom and Karen once again."

Our group included 3 kids - ages 6, 11 and 13 - and Karen was great with all of them! She managed to hold their attention and keep them engaged throughout the trip. The tour of the Dutch Countryside was the highlight of our entire trip to me. You visit these quaint little villages - it's like stepping back in time. We got to see not only how they made Dutch cheese - but also wooden shoes. Definitely something everyone should see. We also toured a 500+ year old windmill - the miller was even there to answer questions and show us around. Beyond the tour itself - Tom and his team are simply the best. From my first email exchange to my last minute request to pick up a package from our hotel - they were 100% customer focused. If you are considering a trip to the Netherlands - this is the team to do it with - you will not be disappointed. We can't wait to come back and see more of this amazing country with this great group of people."

We opted to take the Countryside Tour with Karen on one day, and a custom tour in Arnhem revolving around the WWII Operation Market Garden, Battle for the Arnhem Bridge with Dirk. As our tour in Arnhem was a custom tour, Tom took great care to determine our desires, and offered a couple priced options depending on whether we would want a private car and driver from Amsterdam to Arnhem, or if we would hop on the train and meet the guide on the train platform in Arnhem. We opted for the train (much less expensive) and were furnished detailed instructions for the direct and easy one hour trip from Amsterdam Central Station to Arnhem. Our guide, Dirk, is a retired Colonel and former teacher at the Dutch Higher Military School. Dirk is an expert and engaging guide. He took us in his personal car to battlefields, paratrooper and glider drop zones, the Hartenstein Airborne Museum (where he also volunteers), and of course, the bridge. When he guided us through the Museum, and although he wasn't calling attention to himself, he was so obviously knowledgeable that a couple military cadets started discretely following us so as to listen in. My husband was beaming during the entire tour. This was easily the highlight of our visit to the Netherlands for my husband who is very interested in WWII history.The next day we toured the countryside north of Amsterdam (Markem, Edam, and Schermerhorn polder) with Karen. She promptly picked us up at our hotel and dropped us off there after the tour. As noted throughout the Toms Travel Tours reviews, Karen is an experienced, knowledgeable and fun guide. I won't repeat her accolades other than to say they are richly deserved. The tour locations were unbelievably beautiful, and the polder in particular with it's fantastic windmills would have been completely inaccessible to us without private transportation. Don't hesitate to take either of these tours. They were organized for our comfort and convenience and provided a wealth of local knowledge and insight that would not be accessible to people like us who are visiting the Netherlands for just a short time."

We had read reviews for this company and arranged an afternoon walking tour. Simon was our guide. He met us exactly on time in our hotel lobby for the tour. We like to walk and we adjusted the tour on the go based on what we wanted to see. Simon is from the city and knew all of the streets, history and details. And how to keep us out of the way of the bicycle riders. He took us into some of the quiet gardens and off the beaten path areas. He gave us an understanding of living in the city now as well as the history. Simon offered to stop for coffee and rest for a while but we enjoyed the walk and the scenery. We visited the waterfront, red light district, Dam square, along the canals, and the Joordan area, and then back to the central rail station and along the waterfront. Scheduling the tour was very easy, through email with the owner. This was a great tour for us. Simon was a wonderful guide. I would recommend this company without any hesitation."

Tom was very responsive in answering all my email queries when booking a private countryside tour from Amsterdam for four of us (about 9:30 am -5:30 pm). Tom was not available for the date we requested so he hired Karen to be our guide. Karen was prompt, personable and extremely knowledgeable about the history of the Netherlands with lots of interesting stories about customs and myths.Our first stop was Broek in Waterland, a lovely traditional village. We walked the quiet streets and stopped in the local church where bible stories are presented in a big panel of painted Delft tiles and chatted with a local inn owner who was setting up for a private party and invited us in to see the traditional historic building. Then we stopped in Marken, a picturesque harbor town. From there, we stopped at a set of shops that demonstrated and explained the making of cheese and wooden shoes. Although a bit touristy, it was fun and we learned a great deal from the friendly young demonstrators. After that, we went to Edam and had lunch at a tavern on the square and walked around the town. Our last stop was in the Schermerhorn Polder to see a still working windmill where you can enter and observe all the moving parts and how the occupants would have lived. Karen had brought us some Dutch goodies to sample including chocolate, waffle cookies, wine, cheese--it was nice and convivial way to end the day before heading back to Amsterdam.Highly recommend this tour."

Tom was gracious and accommodating, giving us many options throughout the day. I was so much fun to have him as our guide. We were able to see tulip and hyacinth fields that were off the beaten path and very picturesque! He suggested a pancake restaurant for lunch in a small town and it was perfect. Another side trip to Edam offered more quaint and lovely scenes, in addition to the cheese we bought and the snacks he so kindly provided. I'm a photo enthusiast and was very happy to find out that Tom is also a travel editor/photographer. He was snapping photos all day and forwarded some to us after the trip-bonus!

I never write any reviews but in this case, I had to. Tom really is that good of a guy. Words cannot do justice to how good Tom really is when it comes to showing you around Amsterdam. A lot of other people have written a lot better and more descriptive reviews and I can easily back them up; without a doubt. If you're visiting Amsterdam and looking around for tours or tour guides, just stop and get a hold of Tom, you won't be disappointed. I booked a last minute trip to Amsterdam (8 hours before my flight from Toronto) and sent him an email. It was the weekend so I wasn't sure if he'd even respond. As soon as I got off of my flight from Toronto to Munich, I got a phone call from Tom. He was extremely professional and I told I'm that I still have 2 more flights before reaching Amsterdam. We made plans to meet in my hotel lobby in a few hours. He explained me how to reach my hotel from the airport, just an amazing guy. The private tour started, he arrived in time and we started walking around the city; we took a tram, saw so many attractions, he took my pictures, explained the history (dating back to 13th/14th century), it was one of the best experiences. Once the tour ended, he went his way and I went my own but he made sure i could get back to my hotel without getting lost. He even followed up with a few emails and text messages afterwards to make sure I had arrived safe and recommended a few more places to see and visit. I'm typing this on a phone and have skipped quite a few details here, but as I mentioned above, my words cannot do justice to the kind of service Tom provided, so I'll leave it at that."

To the 2 fantastic guides (Jacq & Simon) who showed us around; to choices of eating places and food tasting recommended for our group of 23 people and the airport transfer arrangement. It was absolutely fantastic and very professional . Would highly recommend to anyone who would want to know Amsterdam intimately. Well done!!"

From my first correspondence via email I knew I had selected the BEST touring company to meet my specific needs. I wanted to visit the areas north of Amsterdam, specifically the picture postcard village of Geithoorn. He created a terrific and very FLEXIBLE itinerary based on my personal interests & activity preferences---biking, boating, wildlife, & photography. I felt quite fortunate to have Tom as my guide for those 3 remarkable & memorable days. He spoke perfect English and knows his native country inside and out. I learned so much about the areas we visited in addition to enjoying all the sites/activities. Everything was included except meals, but he always had a great stash of yummy treats & water. I was so happy I used this company after reading other great reviews on TripAdvisor. Tomstravel Tours will custom tailor tours that will surely deliver! It has my highest recommendation."

And he will take care of you (believe me, you need it with all those cyclists around!). I went in a second tour around the hidden gems of Amsterdam and that was really surprising! We visited so many places I couldn\u2019t imagine existed. We went to some funny places in the north of the city, hip enterprises in old industrial buildings and to the Jordaan\u2026 I loved it!

Tom took incredible pictures of our family along the way and so we have amazing keepsakes from our time in the tulip fields.I loved the personal attentiveness to the tour, right down to the lovely snacks along the way!Also, Anna guided us on a 4 hour city tour. She had such a wonderful way with my 10 and 11 year old that they learned just as much as the adults did. She was open to changes in the itinerary as we wanted to stop a bit more along the way. She included some great stops that the kids enjoyed too. We learned a lot about the city and had a wonderful time overall. I highly recommend going with Tom and Anna!"

It was a great tour and Karen also took me to see the North Sea where we enjoyed a wonderful lunch at a restaurant right on the beach. We even stopped to see and take photos of big, beautiful fields of colorful tulips during our drive. It was one of the unexpected nice extra surprises on this trip. Karen helped make the day interesting and fun. My third tour was also a half-day walking tour of the Jordan area of Amsterdam with Ana. We walked through the wonderful Saturday markets and stopped for apple pie at Winkels. It was the best pie I ever had! We took a ferry across the IJ river to the former factory area that has been transformed to a working space for artists with restaurants and night life re-vitalizing the area. I am very glad I was able to see so many places with Toms Travels that I would not have been able to see on my own."

By the end of the day we were all happy and exhausted. Jacky went the extra mile, introducing us to people, answering my many questions about the history of the Netherlands, laughing with my quiet but quirky family. I couldn't have asked for more. Seeing Holland that way made our trip so much richer. I hope we can get back to Amsterdam. If we do, our first call will be to Tom. Thank you Tom and Jacky!

After reading all the rave reviews I knew they were the company we would use for our explorations! The first tour was a 4 hour walking tour with Toms lovely wife Ana. She brought us all over Amsterdam and was so knowledgeable and kind! Ana is a Professor of Euroean history so you can only imagine how interesting it was to walk around with her around the city while learning so much about the history and culture. She told us things and pointed out places and architectural knowledge of the city we would have never learned on our own. The next day Tom picked us up at our hotel and we were off for our countyside excursion! We started the tour with the famous flower garden Keukenhof and it was great having him there to guide us all around the enormous gardens all while taking beautiful photos of us and the gardens. (Tom is a former professional travel photographer!! This was a huge perk as anyone who has ever traveled as a couple knows that getting enough pictures of you and your significant other without the embarssing selfie stick is a challenge!) After the gardens Tom took us to a beautiful old windmill for another photo op and history lesson! From there we went to the beautiful suburban town of Broek in Waterland that I fell in love with! We had lunch in a charming small local pancake (crepe) restaurant that Tom and Ana recommended, it was incredible!! From there we went to the fishing village of Edam which was so picturesque!! Tom was an amazing guide! He was fun and friendly and so knowledgable! He quickly felt like an old friend! I can't say enough good things about Tom and Ana! The tours with them was the highlight of our weeklong trip in the Netherlands and London! Do not hesitate to book with them!!! Thanks again Tom and Ana for an experience we will never forget and the beautiful photographs to cherish for years to come!!"

They have a great questionnaire that is really helpful in letting them know about your interests, dislikes, time, physical challenges (KNEE!) and other important info. Tom gets back to you ASAP with some recommendations and some info to help you determine what you would like to do. We went with the introductory tour, an three-hour walking tour with Ana, one of Tom's associates, the afternoon that we arrived in Amsterdam.Ana was just great. Met us at the hotel, she was on time, we were on time, and off we went. We walked, rested, talked about the history, about restaurants and museums. Ana was great in guiding us and in providing helpful tips and hints. Amsterdam is VERY easy to get around in using public transportation but there were some little things that helped us even more. Ana had a great sense of humor and could not have been a better introductory guide for us and our four days in Amsterdam. I highly recommend reaching out to Tom and his people if you are going as they are very helpful, really glad to see you, and will keep you from wasting time while in Amsterdam. My wife and I talked about our time with Ana and it didn't feel like an introductory tour....it felt like a local friend walking us around on our first visit to the city in which they happened to live. That's how it should be done."

Tom over exceeded our expectations. With the little information we gave him, he managed to find the plot of land, knocking on doors and asking questions for us. We were also able to find a relative and had coffee with them, using Tom as a translator when needed. And we were able to find family gravestones at a local church. On the way back to Amsterdam he tried to fit in some extra sight seeing. We were just a bit too early for tulips but saw some, and walked fields of crocuses. We also stopped at a windmill and a water dike.Tom was not only a great tour guide explaining and answering all and any questions we had, but he was also an amazing photographer including pictures in our package with him. It was nice being able to enjoy your surroundings and not worry about taking pictures. And the pictures he took were amazing. He definitely has an eye for it. He also suggested a few places to eat in Amsterdam for our last night which we used and experienced one of the best dinners we've ever had. I, myself was 7 months pregnant during this trip and Tom took all the care to make sure I was comfortable, and had as many bathroom breaks as needed. Snacks, water, and beer for my husband. Although a private tour can be a bit pricey, Tom is worth every penny and we would suggest his service to all who are looking to do an out of the box tour.Tom we already miss your cheerfulness and wish you the best.Your friends from Canada"

Tom met my girlfriend and I at our hotel and first spent a few minutes teaching us about the different functions of our compact cameras.

He also explained a lot of the history of Amsterdam as we made our way through different areas.This is exactly what I was looking for. Anyone can walk around with you and take pictures (and Tom was great with that too), but the best part was learning how to use our cameras properly and figuring out how to take the right shots and use the light appropriately. This is something that will stick with us and really help us to get the most out of our trips going forward. I would definitely recommend Tom!"

            "review": "Dutch Countryside Tour -- A Must See!. Tom\u2019s Travel Tours came highly recommended by Trip Advisor, so we decided to try it out. We went on the Dutch Countryside Tour ( Marken, Volendam, Edam and Zaanse Schans) just a week ago ( late March ) with Jackie and could not have enjoyed it more! A visit to Amsterdam is not complete with an excursion to the countryside to the north, and Jackie was a wonderful guide. She was warm, entertaining and knowledgeable, we really felt at home with her. First, she picked us up from our hotel, and gave us a whirlwind tour of Amsterdam, giving us a historical and cultural background of the Netherlands ( like why is it sometimes called Holland? ) , why the Dutch are so friendly and pragmatic ( if you had to rely on your neighbors to prevent your home from being flooded every day you would be too !) and how such a tiny nation with almost no natural resources became the World power in the 1600s ( industrial espionage, religious freedom, the sawmills, and a pluckiness brought about by centuries of fighting against the water), then we went on to Marken. Marken is a sleepy and cozy, ex-fishing village ( there are only about 3 fishermen left, according to Jackie ), which is primarily a residential area now ( you can only own a house in Marken if you have associations with Marken ) not a tourist trap like neighbouring Volendam. We went into a wonderful gift store ( the first gift store in Marken, opened up by an old granny some 70 or 80 years ago who discovered that she made more money selling gifts on the side to American tourists than her rooming house business ) where the current proprietor ( a really nice and friendly fellow ) showed us how to tell \u201creal\u201d Royal Delft porcelain from \u201cfake\u201d ones. It was drizzling and windy, but the town was so lovely, we just shrugged off the weather and went all around with Jackie as a guide ( she has very good friends in Marken ). Then it was off to the \u201ctourist trap\u201d of Volendam, but only because it had really good smoked eel ( not bad, but I think I like teriyaki eel better ) and pickled herring ( like kimchi, definitely an acquired taste ) , our young son enjoyed a croquette from the local Febo chain, and we saw a real Herring Boat. At Edam we had tea, and enjoyed a walk down town, to try different cheeses ( finally buying a small \u201cwheel\u201d of Baby Edam) , went to an old-time sweet shop ( where our son loaded up on different kinds of sour gummi bears) and went to the best bakery in Edam ( I can personally attest to the excellent quality of their almond tarts). Edam is very scenic, and tranquil, as if from a different time, like the postcards of a sleepy European village you often see. Jackie seemed to know almost all the shop owners there, so they were very friendly and accommodating. Then finally it was off to the Zaanse Schans to see the Windmills. Without a doubt, visiting an actual working windmill was the highlight of the trip \u2013 there are at least half a dozen you can choose from, each with its own history, function and name. We went into Het Jonge Schaap ( \"The Young Sheep\"). Het Jonge Schaap is the only working sawmill, originally built in the late 1600s, demolished in the last century and \u201crebuilt\u201d sometime in the last 15 years as a cultural preservation project. Although the winds were not very strong, we actually saw it at work, sawing a huge tree trunk! The people running the mill (all volunteers) were really friendly and told us that the mill was actually \u201cprofitable\u201d and explained (as the saws were running) how everything worked. We also saw a Chocolate Museum, and tasted roasted cocoa beans ( Jackie said that while the Belgians might think they have the best chocolates in the world, all their cocoa comes from the Netherlands! ) and a Wooden Shoe factory. Overall the Dutch Countryside Tour was quite exhausting, lasting almost 8 hours, but very, very enjoyable. Thanks for the wonderful tour Jackie!"

Both were excellent and were a highlight of our trip. We are a family of 5 (with 3 teenage girls) and the tour was an excellent balance of information and fun. Ana took us on our walking tour, and by the end we were sad to say goodbye to her -- we felt like we had made a new friend! She provides information in such a casual, yet informative way that all of us learned a great deal. Our girls tend to \"soak in\" information and then process it later, so for the rest of the trip we heard them talk about the walking tour and the Countryside Tour. We were lucky to have Tom himself guide us through the countryside. He knows that our kids love animals, so we visited a dairy farm, met cows and calves, and then met a very smart pig at a cheese & clog shop. The tour was well paced, and Tom is a wonderful guide. He is a professional photographer, so we ended up with incredible photos of our adventure. He also has a relaxed and conversational style, so that you feel like you are being led by a family friend and not a guide. Both Ana and Tom provide snacks and refreshments, so we never felt tired or grumpy. We highly recommend both of these tours. You might not think you need the walking tour of Amsterdam, but I felt like it gave us a view of the city that we'd only get if we lived there for a long time. Both tours made us want to return to The Netherlands! We left the US thinking \"Is a week too long for Amsterdam?\" and the answer was a resounding \"NO!!\" from all of us. Our kids have asked us to look into moving there--that was how great the vacation was and how much the tours contributed to their understanding of the culture. Thank you, Tom and Ana!"

I researched some things unique to our family history (property my husband's family owned in the 1800s, where family members were buried, etc.) and mentioned it to Tom via email. He then went above and beyond and arranged for the church to be open for us to see AND spoke to the current homeowners of one of the properties my husband's ancestors owned so we could take a look inside! Tom even offered to contact people living in the town with the same last name as us to meet while we would be in the town. On top of all of that, Tom is a professional photographer and documented our entire time together. I had mentioned to Tom before we arrived in Amsterdam via email that I also really wanted to see tulips (or some flowers) in the ground, even though I knew we were a few weeks early. He made a special detour on our way back to Amsterdam and we searched and searched for flowers and he delivered! Not only did we stop at the first patch of flowers we saw, but he kept looking and we stopped at least another two times!

It was our first time in Amsterdam therefore I requested her to fetch us as we might get lost getting our way to the bike rental shop. On our way to the shop, she bring us to a street market and had some local pastries which was very nice. (we could not get it anywhere else on any other day!) After we get our bike, she brought us to a lot of places which I dont think I will visit if we were to explore on our own. We even took a ferry to go over to the north area which was more peaceful than the city and we had our cup of coffee in a very cool container cafe! Ana wouldn't stop talking & we had to keep on catching up with her, which is good! We learn a lot of things about the city, the people and their culture. We are six ladies and we felt very comfortable with Ana, especially when she brought us to the red light district. (which I requested as I did not know what to expect there but with Ana around, we felt safe! Hehe!) The tour is very flexible right from the start when I emailed Tom and Ana. Although they have their own route for that four hours of tour, they were flexible when I requested on some places of interest which we would like see. I would definitely recommend this tour to any of my friends whom going over to Amsterdam!"

He spent a lot of time emailing back and forth with me to ensure he addressed every single detail of our tours to ensure we wouldn't encounter any challenges or obstacles once we arrived in Amsterdam. Tom and his guides were exceptionally professional, knowledgeable, patient and friendly. Tom put together a wonderful package that included transfers to and from the airport to our hotel, full-day excursion to Bruges, Belgium, full-day tour of the Dutch countryside and a half-day walking tour of Amsterdam. Thanks to Tom we were able to really make the most of our trip to Amsterdam. We will most certainly call on Tom again the next time we visit The Netherlands."

A terrific visit to a windmill lived in and operated by a friend of Tom's with a personal tour of the facility by the caretaker who lives there was extraordinary. The fishing and other villages that we visited were charming. The restaurant in Edam where we enjoyed our lunch in was outstanding. We would never have found such a spot were it not for our knowledgeable guides. There was not a dull moment the entire day. A feature we all enjoyed was the tasty array of fresh fruit, cheeses, cookies and beverages that Tom provided for our snacking pleasure. I would heartily recommend Tom's Tours to anyone without reservation. We were a group of 11 adults visiting Amsterdam as a \"topper\" to our ski trip in Verbier."

Our tour also included Delft which is a must if you're visiting Amsterdam. He also made reservations at a quaint little restaurant with delicious food. Tom also provided us with snacks including cheese, beer, soft drinks for the kids and even prosecco for my wife. The following day we had a tour with his lovely wife, Anna, who is a history professor of the center of Amsterdam. It was a great way to learn the prospective of how Amsterdam was created and the reasoning behind what has now become the central hub of Europe. Anna also made reservations at a great pancake house restaurant which is a must to try when you visit Amsterdam. We also had a great glass of Gluwein, a warm red wine made only around Christmas time which was absolutely delicious. Our family travels quite a bit internationally and I must say Tom's tours have been the best that we have ever experienced!"

We arranged a custom tour, focusing on Kinderdijk, a UNESCO heritage site with 19 working windmills. Before our trip, Tom helped with everything from helping us find a hotel to finding a historic place in Amsterdam to taste genever. (Wynand Fockink has been a tasting room since 1679!) He answered emails quickly, and was able to give us ideas we would never have known about.For our tour, our guide, Henk, met us in an sparkling clean late model comfortable sedan. We had made special arrangments to be picked up at the Hook of Holland, in the south, after our ferry from the UK. Since we had only a short stay in the Netherlands, we wanted to maximize our time. Henk took such great care of us! We started the day with a koffie in a local bakery, and this was a time we were very glad to have a native speaker with us. Then, in Kinderdijk, he assisted us with the tickets, the boat ride (which ended up being private, too) and even defied the parking laws to pick us up directly at the end, saving us quite a bit of time. He was fully stocked with drinks and snacks, too.We proceeded to Amsterdam and had a narrated driving tour, stopping several times to examine interesting architecture and beautiful views. Henk is extremely knowledgeable and pointed out many interesting things. He's also led quite an intriguing life, and his personal stories were fascinating. And I was so impressed with his driving - Amsterdam is full of narrow streets, an infinite number of bicyclists, and agressive pedestrians, and I would never want to drive there! At the end of the day, he dropped us directly at our hotel. Another reason we loved this tour was the flexibility. We made several changes as we went along, and it all fit perfectly. Obviously, a private tour is more expensive, but it saved us some money on trains and buses. The real value for us, though, was letting us see and do so much more than we would have been able to do otherwise. I would absolutely recommend Tom's Travel Tours, and hope to be able to return to the Netherlands soon to see more wonderful things."

First day we traveled to the countryside to see windmills, a small cheese store/factory, and various other towns along the way. We asked for a van size vehicle which was provided (smoke free) due to the fact I have motion sickness. It was a lovely drive. Hank knew most of the information. The next day we went to the Delft factory which was amazing and highly recommend. We walked around the small town near Delft. The Hague was also lovely to see the parliament building. We did not stay long since we wanted to get back to Amsterdam to go to a museum before it closed. However, I did get to see the King drive right past me in his car on the way to Parliament. Hank did a very nice job and I would recommend him. I just would like to know a bit more details about main buildings and history in places that the company takes us. The company was very professional and Tom was excellent in communicating all the information to us. Price was reasonable although anyone should know that private guides/cars are always more expansive than a \"big bus\" tour with a large group of people. We wanted a private guide/car and were fine with the price since we wanted to do our own thing but would not go higher in price. I absolutely would use this company again!!!

Henk was very considerate of my 86 year old mother, always parking as close as possible to where we wanted to go, to minimise the walking.

Mudwalking is a specific kind of walking trip that's only possible in some parts of the world, with the Waddenzee in the Netherlands to be the most famous spot.We continued on a walking tour of about 4 hours through mud, and wading through hip-deep water. A true adventure!On Ameland everything was organised beautifully. Tom had arranged everything for us, from the comfortable accomodation to our daily outings to the beach, lighthouse and woods. We got lots of information about nature and natural history which was very interesting, and had a lot of fun outings, with the car-sailing on the beach to be the most exciting.This trip is very highly recommended, as are our guides!

She was a wealth of information and very pleasant! My grown children went on the bike trip. They had a great time. They reported that they totally enjoyed it and Jac was very flexible. The ride was originally scheduled for the countryside, but they wanted to stay in the city. Jac changed her plans- they had a wonderful time."

Karen was very helpful and a wealth of information about Holland, the Dutch language and also spoke flawless English. We appreciated her company as much as anything we would see. We visited a few small villages, medium sized towns and functional windmills. In short it was a perfectly planned day for myself and a friend to learn about Holland and their battle with the sea. We were dropped off at our hotel at the end of the day on time.The communication prior to our arrival was also exceptional. An appropriate level of information was gathered to make sure that the day was as fulfilling as it could be. Replies were prompt and there was never a doubt that we would be met upon our arrival. Being able to pay the deposit via PayPal invoice was yet another nice touch.I would strongly endorse the use of Tom's Travel Tours for your tour needs in Holland."

She weaved present day Amsterdam with highlights from Golden Age as we walked through the various neighborhoods. We visited many famous sights and present day areas of social significance.

Having used many private guides over years of travel we were looking forward to our Amsterdam experience based on the great reviews and emails with Tom. We were booked with Ana... as Tom had said... she has a degree in history and that was one of the main focuses for us. Ana is delightful... but was not a great tour guide for us. We lived near and worked in Wash DC for years. Her tour was as if I offered a tour in DC... yes, I could show you places others may not see, I could give you a brief history overview BUT I am not a trained tour guide. History? We asked about Ann Frank... she didn't have much to say. In answer to a question my hubby asked ... \"that is what the internet is for\". No mention of Van Gogh... really? If you only have one day in Amsterdam I would not recommend this tour... if you have several... maybe. If you are going outside of Amsterdam the reviews look stellar so maybe that would be a better use of this company. Perhaps since we had an incredible guide in London Ana just could not compare. For whatever reason, we were this was not a memorable tour for us."

In the past, we have enjoyed private tours in Italy, Prague and Germany and can report from experience that Tom is by far the best guide we have had the pleasure to know. He is professional, knowledgeable, fun, funny and so easy to be with.We spent a 7+ hour day exploring the countryside, biking in Marken, climbing to the top of a church tower in Edam and touring a historic windmill. As others have mentioned, Tom is a professional photographer so having him take photos of our family documenting our day was an added bonus.I found Tom on Trip Advisor and was struck by the number of \"excellent\" reviews he had received. There is a reason that he deserves such accolades. Tom picked us up in his car (not overly spacious but certainly comfortable), and drove us to several towns in the countryside. We were offered yummy snacks, drinks, beer and wine throughout the day. When it was time to go he even gave my daughter and I a parting souvenir. These small touches and Tom's ability to shape a tour to meet our interests and abilities along with his charming personality really make Tom's Travel Tours a must for all visitors to Amsterdam. Honestly, do not think twice, just book it."

He also gave me suggestions on where to visit in the city in addition to the proposed itinerary on the country side.Tom himself was our guide for our day trip. He had everything very well planned and explained the route to us on the map before we set of. The weather was not with us in the morning of our day trip but we managed to make use of the morning to visit some indoor places - cheese factory and the windmill indoor museum. The sky turned clear in the afternoon and Tom took us around to all the scenic places - we went back to Schermerhorn Polder where the windmill museum was at and took some beautiful pictures, and then to Edam, then Marken. All are beautiful villages. We spent some time walked around these villages at leisure and Tom took a lot of beautiful pictures for us (he is a professional photographer!). He had also prepared a lot of snacks and drinks for the toddler and for us. We are all very impressed with the tour, as well as the beautiful pictures that Tom took for us. Highly recommended!"

It was as if he were a friend we had not seen in a long time. He connected beautifully with everyone from 61 year old me to my 20 year old daughter. He is knowledgeable, patient, and kind. We encountered a strong storm. Henk changed the order of itinerary to make certain we had a meaningful experience. I would enjoy taking a tour with Henk again when I return to Amsterdam.Our second tour was with Esther. What a delightful and energetic woman! Once again, she knew about us and tailored our 4-hour Amsterdam walking tour to make certain we obtained the most from the experience. She knew history, architecture, and art. She showed us many \u201chidden treasures\u201d we would have never seen if touring on our own. Again, I would enjoy having Esther guiding us through the Netherlands again, when we return.Of course, none of this would have been possible without the organizational skills of Tom van der Leij, the owner of Toms Travel Tours.

We found Bergen beach, though we have visited many coastal areas around the world, very wide and flat. Drive itself to Bergen via Beemster Polder was very green and beautiful.

They are a bit more expensive than some of the other tours I checked into, but it was well worth the price difference. You do get what you pay for. They treated my family of four more like old friends from out of town than the tour customers we were. I honestly cannot say enough positive things about Tom, Ana and their company. We started the first day with a pleasant walking tour of Amsterdam with Ana. We had never been to the city before and were a little worried about finding our meeting point with her. But before we could ask if Ana would meet us at the hotel, she offered to do so. The tour was around 3 hours of easy walking, and we were able to hit many of the highlights around the city including a nice little market Ana knew about, many lesser known courtyards, and traditional apple pie and coffee. Ana is a historian so you will get a ton of information about the history of Amsterdam too.The next morning Tom met us at our hotel for a day long countryside excursion. This was one of the highlights of our entire three week vacation. My 13 year old son told me on the way home that it had been his favorite day. Tom, like Ana, is a gracious host and very knowledgeable about his country. He planned the entire day around the very vague requests we had made and turned the trip into something special. We visited two really nice small villages including Edam, a working windmill, a 17th century church, saw a lot of beautiful scenery and the major waterworks north and east of the city and had a picnic for lunch. Tom drove 45 minutes north at the very end of the day so my some could see one of the large dykes there despite the tour running long and Tom expecting dinner guests that evening. Tom is also an accomplished, professional photographer, and he documented the day for us at no additional charge. The photos were great.We've done a lot of tours in Europe, but never one like Tom's. I highly recommend him."

Having read all the raving reviews we decided to go with TTT for two private tours, in spite of their significantly higher prices than that of their competitors. We had booked well in advance; even thus Tom and Ana were not available any more. On Saturday morning we did the three hours walking tour in Amsterdam with Saskia. She picked us up in the hotel perfectly on time, and we did a leisurely tour of the city \u2013 just the way we wanted. We walked around in the Jordaan area, the canal district, a bit of the centre of the city and ended in Spui (where we had booked lunch in the Seafood Bar \u2013 superb). Saskia was nice and relaxed, we had a good time with her.Sunday we did the one-day countryside tour with Karen. She was also very nice, and perfectly knew her business. She drove around with confidence, showed us Marken, Edam, Schermerhorn \u2013 we had a very enjoyable day.TTT are a very professional up-scale tour company. If you want privacy, absolute flexibility, knowledgeable and pleasant guides, and don\u2019t mind the cost \u2013 go with them."

My husband and I received an educators grant to explore Dutch culture and polish photography skills. Tom was so easy to work with and took our physical abilities and interests into consideration when planning our itinerary. Because Tom is a professional photographer, he is skilled at teaching amateur photographers how to capture great pictures and was also a big help in learning how to use the features of our digital camera. One of our favorite things we did in Amsterdam was going up into the tower of the Westerkerk for a truly breathtaking view. Great spot for photographs of the city! Tom knows the city inside and out and fills your tour with history and tidbits about the Netherlands. We also loved the apple pie at Winkel's. We took the train through North Holland and \"camped\" overnight in a Pipowagen. A truly one of a kind experience for us, as we love camping. We also biked through the sand dunes, spent time at the beach and cycled through little villages. We really enjoyed our time with Tom--he is easy to get along with, concerns himself with your needs and is also funny! We enjoyed his affectionate attention to pets and he is also a great BBQ chef! Tea? Coffee? :)"

On a very warm morning, the six of us (all adults) met our guide Karen near the Anne Frank House and took a 4-hour walking tour through the Jordaan, the islands and back into the city center. We stopped at a great coffee shop and at a herring stand to taste some local treats. Karen was fun, knowledgable and the perfect guide.

After spending a few days in Amsterdam last year, my wife and I decided to take our day in Amsterdam off the Oceania Marina to see the Dutch countryside. Tom of Tom's Travel Tours was easy to work with as we ironed out the details over the Internet. Our guide was the charming and funny Karen. We started our Countryside tour with a pick up at our cruise ship at 9am. Our first stop was in Marken, a fishermen town connected to mainland thanks to a dike built in 1957. This traditional Dutch town has a beautiful sea (nowadays lake) front with its typical green and white houses. Then we went to Edam, a little town that has existed since the 12th century and is famous by the internationally known Edam cheeses - which we had a chance to sample. We visited the Speeltoren, the Kwakelbridge and a cheese cellar. We had lunch at LaFortuna and feasted on Dutch specialties and bier. Afterwards, we drove via the Beemster Polder, a UNESCO Heritage Site due to the perfect design and the water management improvement that it meant in the 17th century. We will saw numerous windmills in the Schermerhorn Polder and visited one of them. On the way back, we drove through Rijp, a beautiful old village. We stopped in Rijp and visited and beautiful old church. Outside of Rijp we stopped at an area that oversaw the polder and Karen provided us with a snack of various delicacies and drinks. We were back in Amsterdam around 5pm. We were there in plenty of time to make sure we weren't' left in Amsterdam."

It was a perfect itinerary - executed by a eloquent, kind, and thoughtful guide, Henk.

After reading many reviews and exchanging a lot of emails, I chose Toms Travel Tours for our group of 7 seniors on our 2 1/2 day trip to Amsterdam. It was an incredible choice! We were lucky enough to get Tom and his lovely wife Ana as our guides. Tom's planning was meticulous. We were able to see everything on our list and so many things we never dreamed we would see. Ana took us on 2 walking tours. One around Amsterdam where we not only saw the popular tourist sights but so much more. The other let us explore the Red Light District. Her information and explanations gave us a much better perception of the area and allowed us to see it in a different light. Tom took us to the Keukenhof Gardens, Tulip Fields, and several countryside villages. We saw how cheese is made, how wooden shoes are made, and went to, as well as inside, a working Windmill. Tom also helped us arrange tours to several of the museums. We never felt rushed or even tired. Tom prepared a picnic and snacks for us and there were plenty of stops along the way. Tom even took us to a camera store so one of the couples with us could buy a new camera when their camera malfunctioned. I can't believe how much we saw! It felt like Tom and Ana were old friends and we were all out for a casual afternoon. It couldn't have been any better!! The van was very comfortable and everyone had windows to view the countryside as we passed by. Tom is also a professional photographer, and as a bonus, he took pictures of all of us throughout our tours. They are some of our most treasured souvenirs. Not only are they excellent pictures, they allow us to remember every little place we visited and all the things we saw. Tom and Ana are amazing, easy to work with and a joy to be with. Write them now, before they are booked, I promise you will not be sorry!"

We corresponded multiple times as he developed the perfect itinerary for our time together, so we were had high expectations. Then, during the cruise, four additional people asked to join group so, once again, I was in contact with Tom while we were on the Rhine River. Doubling the size of our group at the last moment posed no problem and he assured me that we would all have a terrific time. On the day of the tour, May 28, 2015, it was cold and blustery with showers, but it didn't matter. Our guide for the day, Henk, was absolutely superb! A world traveler himself, with an amazing knowledge of \"his\" city, he held our rapt attention for over four hours. We had a wide range of ages in our expanded group and Henk was able to accommodate our varying rates of walking speed. Tom's Travel Tours treated our group to coffee at about mid-morning, which felt and tasted so good, given the cold day. Both Tom and his guide, Henk have perfect mastery of English, so there was never a need to ask for a clarification or a repeated phrase or description. We walked through the Jordaan area and then took the ferry to the modern side of Amsterdam where we visited the site of the world's first 3-D printed Canal House. It is totally amazing that a real home is being constructed from printed components. Henk shared so much information on the architecture and history of Amsterdam that we came away with a much richer understanding of the place and the culture. I am convinced that travelers simply cannot go wrong by booking Tom's Travel Tours. I would do it again in a heart beat!"

I can not say enough about the day and the scenery. Karen was extremely knowledgable about the amazing history of Holland. Tom created an itinerary from my email \"wish\" list and did a fantastic job. Karen was over the top had helped us plan the rest of our time in Amsterdam and gave us a lot of places and things we shouldn't miss. We can not thank Tom Travel Tours and Karen, our new friend for an amazing day.Lee and Janice Texas, USA"

            "review": "Fantastic Experience!. Tom's Travel Tours was the best activity decision we made while in Europe this year. We had a fantastic time in the crazy and beautiful city of Amsterdam and the surrounding countryside. Tom's tours were fantastic and allowed us to see more in two days than most see in twice that long. For us, the best part of all was the feeling that we were not on a tour, but rather spending time with friends from the city. We did three separate private tours; A city tour with Anna, a Red light/Night Tour with Tom, and a full day countryside tour with Karen. From the moment we met each of them we felt as though we were with old, new friends. Spending half a day with Anna wondering the city provided us the opportunity to learn about everyday life in Amsterdam while we were seeing the sights. Anna is lovely, charming, and was a pleasure. Our countryside tour was a wonderful educational experience. Karen is very knowledgeable and lots of fun to be around; she went out of her way to make sure we saw as much as we could and learned to appreciate the Netherlands and her ingenious people...and we laughed, a lot! It was a great day. Our evening tour with Tom was something else all together. Tom is a charming, fun, educated man; it was a pleasure and a privilege to spend an evening with one of Amsterdam's true sons. His love of his native city shines through everything he says and does. I was particularly impressed with his respect of the women in the red light district and the way he handled that particular experience. Bottom line, our experience in Amsterdam was more than we ever hoped it would be thanks to Tom's Travel Tours! Tours were easy to arrange and Tom worked with us to ensure we were able to do exactly what we wanted in a way that fit our schedule. If you are on the fence about booking, just do it, you won't be disappointed!"

From the first contact, Tom engaged us and made sure he knew exactly what we wanted. We did a nighttime photo tour with Tom and he is an excellent teacher. I would classify myself as maybe beginner photographer with just a little experience, and he was able to teach me more about the camera settings, how to compose the picture, and how to make the picture come alive. We also did a tour with Ana the next morning and she was just as knowledgable about Amsterdam's history. She took us to areas of the city that we would have never visited on our own, and gave us a much more personal insight into Amsterdam instead of just the typical tourist overview. We had our almost 5 year old daughter with us, and they were both so wonderful and accommodating with her. I really can't say enough positive things about Tom and Ana, and we thoroughly enjoyed both tours. Highly, highly recommend them!!!"

What happens when you only have one day for sightseeing in the historic charming picturesque city of Amsterdam and surrounding area?The answer is to maximize your time, forget about sightseeing on your own, definitely do NOT take a crowded bus tour with too many strangers each with their own interests/agendas, and hire, as we did, an outstanding and knowledgeable private driver/guide, Tom van der Leij, a resident of Amsterdam, and owner of Tom's Travel Tours (www.tomstraveltours.com). Tom is an extraordinary person, knowledgeable guide, some who loves showing people his incredible city and country, as well as a travel editor/writer and professional photographer who has travelled to over 100 countries! Since we were traveling with a van full of luggage, and ending our tour at the airport, Tom also enlisted the assistance of his charming wife, an equally knowledgeable guide, Ana Rodr\u00edguez Giles, to make our sightseeing experience truly unforgettable!As seniors in our mid 70's travelling with my partially disabled wife who uses a transport wheel chair during sightseeing, we outlined what we wanted to do and see, and Tom made excellent suggestions and put together an incredible sightseeing adventure for the day sightseeing in Amsterdam along the various canals and districts, as well as traveling outside the city to the picturesque 'cheese' city of Edam, where we stopped for our first ever 'tailgate picnic,' to maximize our sightseeing time. From Edam we viewed and visited fields of miles and miles of the most beautiful Tulips in full bloom in magnificent colors, followed by a visit to a working windmill where I climbed to the top and learned the reasons for their being in Holland, and what function they served. We ended our adventure with a drop off at the airport, where Tom assisted me with my wife, all of our luggage and wheelchair.Throughout the day Tom offered professional photography tips and suggestions so I could take more interesting, exciting, professional photos. In addition, in honor of our 51st Anniversary celebration, Tom took numerous professional photos of our sightseeing experience and emailed them to while we were still in Europe. Our adult children and grandchildren were astounded by the outstanding quality of the photos, how well they captured our enjoyment of what we experienced, and posted some of them to their facebook pages.My wife and I are planning to return to Amsterdam in a few years so we can sightsee at a more leisurely pace, as well as see some of the other cities of the Netherlands. Without any hesitation, we will definitely contact Tom and Ana and enlist their services!."

A really super day with photos later to remind us of the wind and recommendations of places to visit in Amsterdam. Thoroughly enjoyable.

Over the course of our numerous travels my husband and I have found that reserving private customized tours is the best way to see the countries we visit. Local tour guides know where to take you and show you things you wouldn\u2019t see in normal tours. This also allows us to keep our own pace and focus on what we want to absorb from the visit. We selected Thomas\u2019s Tours based on all the very positive reviews on trip advisor. Thomas lived up to and went well beyond our expectation for our tour of the Netherlands. He provided several options for the day long tour. The final package was based on our desire to see the tulip fields, windmills, cheese production and to try some local beer. We started at Keukenhof to see all the tulips in bloom. Afterwards, we headed to North Holland to explore the several small towns and tulip fields along the way. Due to the weather instead of having picnic we stopped for lunch at a quaint inn, it was a very good meal. After lunch we headed to three historic windmills that still work today. We were allowed to venture into the windmills while they were working. Thomas gave us a look into Netherlands\u2019 culture making it a very memorable, educational experience. We highly recommend Thomas to provide you a wonderful experience during your visit to the Netherlands. A few additional things Thomas provided were pictures of our tour and refreshments along the way. Both were a pleasant surprises that just enhanced our day together."

We booked two full days with Tom and his wife Ana, and they gave us one of our all time most enjoyable and memorable vacation experiences. A day walking with Ana through Amsterdam was fun, exciting and enlightening. Seeing the buildings, canals and architecture in parts of the City most tourists never get to see was wonderful, but seeing these things through the eyes of a PHD in European history (which Ana is) gave us a special perspective on the remarkable Dutch and their place in European and world history.The following day with Tom was equally enjoyable, as we toured the blooming tulip fields, visited the seaside to see the dykes and land reclamation projects for which the Dutch are justly renowned, walked around the town of Edam, and toured an antique working windmill on a blustery day, topped off by lunch at the charming bungalow where Tom's family has summered since he was a boy.Best of all, in addition to their knowledge and professional courtesy, and Tom's wonderful photography, both Tom and Ana are warm, charming and delightful companions, and they make you feel as if you are being taken on tour by long time friends sharing with you the City and country they dearly love."

For the full day tour we went to Marken, Edem, Cheese Tasting, went inside an old windmill, took photos at tulip fields. We wanted to find a tulip field with windmill in the background and Tom accommodate to that and drove around the places he knew might have and we found it. That was really awesome and we had great photos.For the half day King's Day city tour, Tom brought us to NDSM to see the King's Day flea market there which is much different from those in the city center, saw cool cafes and beautiful architectures. Later, he brought us to Jordaan, soaked up the King's Day atmosphere there as well as walking through beautiful buildings, visited a petting zoo from the outside as it was closed and chance to take lots of photos. He also brought us to a few hidden courtyards which were really beautiful. We ended the tour with the best Apple pie in town. But Tom also recommended places we can visit next before he left. He definitely took care of us.Tom is friendly and he will tell you where he will bring you and you can always give your opinion on where you are interested to visit and he will try to accommodate as much as he can. He is friendly and very fun to tour with. He will take lots of photos and share them with you. He will bring food, drinks for you do you can always snack and drink. You won't get hungry or thirsty in this tour.Awesome tour guide and awesome tours. We definitely enjoyed ourselves. I am so happy I chanced upon tom's website and decided to take his tour.

Tom was prompt to respond our e-mail inquiry and he suggested an excellent itinerary with everything we wanted - a tour of Keukenhof and Amsterdam with our own private guide; all at a price comparable to some of the crowded Keukenhof bus tours. Tom picked us at the airport just as scheduled (he actually had to wait on us for nearly an hour since our flight was a bit delayed) and he quickly made us feel at ease with his warm personality. Our day tour was truly a most enjoyable, relaxing, and unforgettable experience. Tom even packed a delightful picnic lunch of local cheeses, breads, fruit, chocolates and stroopwaffles. As a bonus, Tom (a very talented photographer), took some beautiful photos of our family during our tour and e-mailed them to us. What a wonderful souvenir from an absolutely marvelous day!

If we are ever fortunate enough to get back to Amsterdam, we will definitely use Toms Travel Tours again!"

He is warm and welcoming, professional, flexible, and does everything he can to be sure his guests are having the experience they want. Tom picked us up at our hotel at 9:30 AM and drove us to explore the countryside. We began in Marken, a fisherman village connected to the mainland by a dike built in 1957. We then went to the town of Edam, a little town that exists since the XIIth century and is famous for its internationally known Edam cheeses. We ate a lot of cheese! And bought a lot of cheese! We drove via the Beemster Polder, a UNESCO Heritage Site due to the perfect design and the water management improvement that it provided in the XVIIth century. Later in the day we saw windmills in the Schermerhorn Polder. We actually met the windmiller who happened to be there at the time. He knows Tom and we were treated to a personal tour. When we were through touring the windmill Tom had laid out a lovely afternoon cheese and wine snack for us, which was a welcome treat near the end of the day. We had a perfect day and were sad to see it come to an end. Tom clearly loves his country, and he showed us exactly why...we are looking forward to visiting again one day and touring again with Tom!"

We visited several hidden courtyards (hofjes) in the Jordaan for instance, but also some animal farms (more fun for the kids), wonderful, old bookshops, galleries and urban beekeepers. We took the ferry to Amsterdam Noord (North), across the river IJ, where many architecturally interesting new developments have sprung up and where one can meet fun and inspiring small business owners and entrepreneurs, as well as stare at the ships sailing by with a beer in hand. Tom showed me new and surprising places; another side of Amsterdam one wouldn't expect and can't find in most guide books. Tom took a personal interest in his customer, was culturally and historically very insightful, and rather charming and humorous \u2026 a great guide.

Ana and Tom make a great team, and we really enjoyed having them show us their city. In addition to the popular tourist sights, we also got to see the quieter side of the city. Tom is an accomplished travel writer/photographer who has traveled all around the world. The photos he captured of us in Amsterdam were a perfect reminder of a special day."

We arrived in Amsterdam on the red-eye the morning we took the tour, so we were a little apprehensive about whether we'd be able to do so much walking, but it worked out great. Ana was our tour guide and she took us around the Jordaan area. I love getting to see the city from a native's perspective. Ana took us to a local market and bought us some Dutch cheese to try. Then, when my parents were feeling a little tired and needed a break from walking, she took us to a small cafe that has \"the best apple cake in Amsterdam\" (it was delicious). I would recommend Ana to any friend visiting Amsterdam, and if I make it back any time soon, I'll definitely be giving one of their other tours a try."

Although we live in Amsterdam ourselves, we heard about Tom's tours and knowledge and we wanted to see our city from a different angle, so to say. Well, Tom did an excellent job. What a deep knowledge does he have of the history of Amsterdam, and he showed us all these little places we never went to before. And he is such a warm person with eye for little details along the way. And the fun thing is: everywhere we went with Tom, he meets aquaintances, which is quite unusual in such a big city. So the city knows Tom, and Tom knows the city very well. Highly recommended!!!"

The lovely Dusica met us at the agreed time and took us to rent our bikes and then we headed out to visit the city. We lucked out with the weather as it was a beautiful summer day so perfect for biking in the city. Dusica was very patient and caring towards my son and careful to make sure he (we) were both safe cycling through the busy and hectic city. It was a fun tour and Dusica took the time to share some favorite spots and history. I would highly recommend Tom's company and Dusica was a fantastic guide."

He is the epitome of the Amsterdam citizen - handsome, nice, polite, giving, and helpful. My friend and I plowed through the details of our tours to exhaustion via email before we met him (the first tour was to get us acclimated to the city when we arrived in Amsterdam, the next tour was into the countryside later on in our week ). He handled all our questions regarding details with ease and respectfulness. Not only is Tom a natural Dutch citizen with much knowledge about Amsterdam and the countryside, he is a professional photographer for Dutch magazines, travelling around the world. As an addition to your tour, he will photograph you like a paparazzi...let him do it! I'm still going through the photos that he took of my friend an me...such great photos...his sense of composition, space and depth is superb. If you get tight with Tom, perhaps he will invite you into his childhood life on the North Sea! He is a truly talented and unique person.Veronica K."

And our day in the countryside was spectacular..visited many small villages-- walked the dikes in Durgerdam munched on cheese in Edam, explored the windmills of Schermerhorn and had a picnic at Tom's family campsite! Our appreciation for the Dutch people and lifestyle increased a thousandfold as Tom recounted the history and culture of his beloved country. I cannot recall enjoying myself more on a \"tour\"..

He adjusted the tour according to what might interested us but also integrate that with some of his own interest. Third, he took us to some really interesting and cool places around Amsterdam. And also told interesting things about what we saw. Fourth, the tour was easy to go on. You do not have to be in great shape. Fifth, Tom was a great person, helpful, funny and easy going.

Tom has a deep love and appreciation for nature, photography, children, animals, and his town - which reflect in his smile, enthusiasm, interactions, and knowledge. Everyone seemed to know him and he exudes genuine happiness. He is the kind of person you wish you could be friends with forever. A few days after our visit, Tom emailed us photos of our family that he had taken while biking. His tour was one of the highlights of our two week Baltic Sea vacation.

We do not like to be too touristy, so this was perfect as we were able to see all the postcard sites taking in the sights and sounds, and also get into the interesting nooks and crannies only locals have access.The next day, Tom and his wife Anna showed us their countryside; they made our day tour most relaxing and enjoyable leaving us all with a beautiful memory of Amsterdam. Our party of 5 included my 81 year old mother, and they looked after us so well it really was like having a trusted good friend as our host. Tom and Anna's attention to detail and safety made us feel safe and worry free throughout.The added bonus of course was Tom taking tons of great pictures enabling us to fully enjoy the sites and really soak in the atmosphere.Oh, they kept feeding us with nuts and biscuits throughout the trip too, which was a nice touch ; )"

This summer we - me, my wife and little boy - cycled the city with a group of Dutchies and tourists with Tom on his Eco Tour. It was great! Tom is a likable, experienced and fun tour guide. He showed us off the beaten track places, interesting and inspiring people and fun cycling routes through the city. We visited honey growers, natural wine makers, eco hoteliers and many more. It was just a great day and way to spend, learn, exercise and taste our day in Amsterdam."

Nice routing, very informative, learned a lot of new stuff about the eco world and how to live better, also as a Amsterdam native it was very surprising to find so many places which we'd never noticed before. I highly recommend to join one of Tom's tours if you are visiting Amsterdam or even when you live around the corner."

The pace is just right allowing you to meet and chat with some inspiring individuals and really get insights into their work. We enjoyed some sights, tastes and smells of Amsterdam along the way - all by bicycle in true local style. Tom has great local knowledge to some of the more unusual eco places in the city and his enthusiasm and patience really helped us get the most from the experience. Would really recommend this to anyone who has half a day to spare and wants to enjoy getting under the \"green\" skin of the city."

Mind blowing experience! in just a few relaxing hours on the bike photo tour with Tom we covered most of the city which changed my preconceived negative views of Amsterdam. It is one of the beautiful city's I have visited in my life form many stand points. Tom is a people person and knows his city well it was very pleasing to see him as we rode around how he interacted with us and the many friends that would wave to him as we rode. How can I not recommend his service. I don't really take many photos although my friend is deeply into it, I was more of an observer as they talk cameras, lens and techniques.Tom thank you for this memorable experience!!!!

He took us to his favorite special spots, like the beautiful hidden courtyards that we would never have found on our own, and the apple pie place, and the flea market, and his buddy's houseboat, and the ferry to the Filmmuseum (the restaurant has a great view of the city) etc, etc.Tom allowed us to see so much in a few hours, exposing us to the Amsterdam biking culture and helping my daughter who was nervous about biking in the city. I recommend the tour with Tom early in your trip as you will see areas you may want to visit in more depth later.Tom is an accomplished photographer and taught us some of the techniques he uses for his work. The pictures he took of us are great!He also hooked us up with a friend with a small boat for a canal tour. Much better than those huge tourist boats."

We did a solid two hour tour of central Amsterdam with him. There's no charge - you contribute at the end - we packed into two hours what would have taken a day if we had to discover it ourselves. A particular attraction is the Beguines (ladies whose community goes back to the Middle Ages) settlement totally off the \"regular\" tourist's path. he's charming, very entertaining, very concerned about our safety (vis-\u00e0-vis cyclists) while at the same time being very informative about the history and present-day culture of Amsterdam. Highly recommended."

We walked through lots of cool areas- some were quiet, busy, beautiful, grungy, different & lively. We tasted cheese, analysed the angles of the Amsterdam buildings, learnt about the Dutch history, talked about the notorious coffee shops & discovered the red light district. Karen was smart, funny & charming- an awesome tour guide!! She was easily approachable and happily answered all our questions- weird & wacky! Thank you!I always recommend starting with a walking tour and then exploring the city on your own.This way you are equipped with some knowledge about the history & culture of the place you are in as you set off. Sometimes I have realised I went past a building that has 500 years of interesting history without knowing it because I didn't know what it was. I find that after doing tours I have an extra enthusiasm and appreciation for a city and I love it!"

The tour was great and Marias was a fabulous guide...very knowledgable and made the tour very interesting with his wit and humour. My only criticism is the size of the tour. There were over 50 in our group, and it was too large. It would have been better to split the group into two, with another guide taking the other group. We booked on line months ago, thinking this was necessary, but it didn't matter as anyone could walk up and join the group on the day."

An interesting person who kept our interest, and actually I am sure overran the time he had with us such was his enthusiasm! I had been to Amsterdam before many years ago and thought I had a reasonable knowledge of the city, but Marius put new light onto history, events, buildings, etc. and I can highly recommend this walking tour as one of the very best I have undertaken.

The city is an imperfect grid so a guided tour is useful in getting the lay of the land. I recommend you check out some \"pre-pay\" tour rates to get an idea for what's a fair tip."

He was fun, friendly and knowledgeable, but several of his comments were in poor taste or ignorant. For example, he talked about men 'needing' sex from prostitutes, referred to 100 000 jews and 90 000 Dutchmen dying in Amsterdam in WWII, (forgetting that those Jew people were Dutch too), he referred to The Dutch East India company as successful in claiming new land for Holland, (I doubt the inhabitants of those countries would have thought of it as new land), and later made a joke about slavery (albeit then saying that it was a very serious matter). I don't want to cast this in the wrong light, the tour as a whole was interesting and fun. I also understand it is hard to be respectful and entertaining. All the same, if he could consider these things more, it would improve the experience."

For a free walking tour, you get what you pay for so to speak, and I think the real sights and sounds are what you will find after you have explored the city yourself after gaining your bearings from the info on the tour :)"

I am very interesting in their efforts to protect themselves and in their efforts at land reclamation and Joost was able to answer all my questions while pointing out other resources that could provide more information. These questions aren't part of their basic tour.Full disclosure: we had come to Dam Square with the intention of doing a walking tour with Sandeman's (i.e. the top ranked tour in town). We jumped ship because this tour had 14 people and there were 25-30 on the Sandeman tour. My wife and I have been all over Europe this year and have done several Sandeman tours. They have good tour guides but they don't control the size of their tours very well. With a large tour, you can't see, you can't hear, and you can't get your questions answered. Very much an inferior experience. For my money, go with the smaller guy. In this case, that was Joost and Free Walking Tours Amsterdam."

What a let down it was. Our guide Tim, wasn't very engaging, or approachable. To us it seems that he was just going thru the motions. The tour felt rushed and the talks in between were not that interesting. Also the jokes he made in the end about tipping, we found a bit embarrassing, and made us feel uncomfortable. The parts of the city we saw on the tour were nice, but there will be other tour companies (on Dam square there are at least 3 other tour companies who also do a free walking tour) who will show you the same things, but hopefully with a bit more enthusiasm, a bit more fun, and with a bit more historical sense."

I took the tour with Tim Lunshof, and yes the tour is laid back and he's a nice person. If you are used to the free tour experience, the idea is that the guide will make you have a blast, will be funny, will be interactive, will tell you interesting things only a local would know, hidden jewels, etc... and then you feel like paying the guy. Tim doesn't come across as someone passionate about his city that wants to show you a great time. The commentaries are very short, not too funny and scarce. You walk a lot (normal), almost no time for pictures, he skipped almost the whole of the IIWW history, no (funny) stories about the Dutch royal house, no (funny) stories about the red district, nothing about the current political climate, etc... Expect a 'nice walk', relaxed guide and enjoy the city."

I, personally, had so much fun and I learned a great deal about the attractions of Amsterdam, especially thanks to our guides Joost and Karen. We even tasted Dutch cheese! If you are into these types of tours which take you to pretty much all the tourist attractions around, but if you do not want to pay too much either; I highly recommend you these wonderful tours of \"Free Walking Tours Amsterdam\". Do not hesitate because of the unbelievably unstable weather of Netherlands, because these tours always go on anyway. Just take your umbrella and camera with you and let these kind and sweet Dutch guides walk you through the streets of Amsterdam or should I say... canals?"

The tour started out by stopping at an interesting [redacted] shop, then through the red light district and then up and down many other areas of the city.The red light district wasn't the main focus of the tour by any means, but it is an interesting part of the city - definitely quite different from any other city we've walked through - and to be honest, I'd probably feel too much like a voyeur to walk through it on my own. Just be aware that it is extremely tacky and disrespectful to photograph the workers.Also saw the former opium trade areas, walked past a few \"coffee houses \" (coffee may be available here, but that's not what they are really selling!), the new and old houses, and learned a lot about why the houses tilt toward the canals, and what the hooks on the roofs are for, and how houses were taxed based on the width of the house, and many more interesting areas.I really enjoy taking walking tours of a new city, and this one fit the bill - thanks, Marius!"

We had a local guide who'd been born and lived most of his life in Amsterdam (apparently this is quite rare!) and he was very knowledgeable about the area and its history, passing on tips on where to go, things to do etc. He brought the stories to life for each of us visiting from different countries.Although there's a lot of walking around involved (it's a walking tour, I know :-)) it didn't feel like it was too much so l think it'll suit most people with different fitness levels and walking abilities. It can get very crowded in the university area so do stay close to the group. I'd definitely recommend doing this tour first to get an idea of places/get your bearings and then if any particular area catches your eye you can come back to it later in your own time and at your own pace."

I'm pretty sure we were shown the incorrect narrowest house in Amsterdam, and we didn't get to see the front of the stock exchange on the tour.Now to the good stuff. Our guide was very nice and made sure everyone felt included and could hear and understand the tour. He spoke English very well. We talked about the palace, then walked over to the backside of the stock exchange and saw the Condom store. From there we walked through the red light district and saw everything there. With various stops along the way we walked on to the old East India Company headquarters, then to the Heilige Stede where the miracle of 1345 occurred. We learned more about the city history as we continued our walking tour back around to the national monument where the tour concluded.For anyone who has not been on a \"free\" tour before here is your warning. The tours are not really free, but are tip based. I have found some of the best tours to be tip based since the guides try their best to get better tips. Unfortunately, this was not one of the best free walking tours I have been on."

Our native guide Karen was warm, entertaining, informative, knowledgeable, well organised and diligently answered our questions (pointing us specifically to some good value eateries). She could be clearly heard in the busy streets, with superb English. And I don't think she ever once alluded to tips, which made for a very refreshing change compared to some other tours I've been on where they are constantly mentioned!For those with Red Light District reservations, the tour does pass through it (right at the start), but it's a key part of the historic city centre, quite interesting and not nearly as seedy as you may think, plus it's not unduly focused upon. Overall it's a well rounded and interesting 2 hour tour, and I'd suggest it's one of the first things you do in Amsterdam."

Tour was in English, conducted by a life long native of the city. Very informative and also funny. Alvin told us all about the history of the city and the laws regarding prostitution and drugs! At the end of the tour, he walked several of us to another neighborhood where he pointed out good local restaurants for dinner. Great tour and great guide. We have done the \"free\" walking tours in several cities now and find them much better than the regular scheduled tours."

We paid attention to everyone who gave him $$. One couple gave him $5 EUR and we gave him $7.50 EUR for 2 of us. Tipping is optional so people should be able to give whatever we want. If he wants a minimum cost per person then set your price like a tour group like $5-10 EUR per person. Not tell people its a tip and complain when he feels its not enough. If we had known, we would go book with another free walking tour group. We had walking tour at other cities and never heard of tour guide complain about tips. If we had known better we would go book another walking tour group as there are 4-5 other companies to go with. We will write about our experience as review on trip advisor and warn other tourists about your tour company. Your tour guide complaining is unprofessional and I would never use or book anything with your company again!!"

We arrived in Amsterdam on Saturday, May 28th and the weather was fantastic. We were a little shell shocked by the amount of craziness going on downtown on a Saturday afternoon after visiting quaint little towns in Belgium and Germany over the last month. We understood that the tour would include the red light district but our guide \"El\" seemed to be a little preoccupied with it. He gave way more detail for a general tour that was not Red Light district themed. We eventually bailed on the tour (which is a first for us). This was not a great introduction to Amsterdam, but the day before we left we decided to give it another go with Sandemans walking tour and we found that one much more to our liking (one of the better ones that we have taken over the years). Yes, they touched on Red Light district stuff, but did not going into minute detail. That tour was filled with interesting historical facts, and a clearer view of Dutch culture (which is what we like). It was a good way to spend our second last day in Amsterdam and gave us a much more rounded view of the city."

We booked on line with Marius before our trip , he confirmed our meeting in Dam Square for 10 30 Sunday 13th March . We were a varied group of nationalities , English , Turkish, German , Chinese, New Zealand and Israelis , 13 all told .A nice size group , easy to group around Marius and hear his stories , his English was perfect , the tour was in English but he did have a few words of welcome with the group in their own language as they joined us.Marius was very humerous , he made us all laugh , he remembered all our names and included us in the banter as we explored the old city We learnt so much during those 2 hours , he really whetted our appetite to know more , so after the tour we had lunch and did the walk on our own , spending time at each talking point . Originally we had hoped to explore the Royal Palace in Dam Square on our return but the Royals were in residence that weekend so our plans had to be revised .So we started the tour again , needless to say 5 hours later we collapsed in a bar , very knowledgeable about facts and also full of ridiculous trivia , but what great time and so lucky having had a dry sunny March day to do it .My daughter and I were staying in a super little hotel in the redlight district and we'd walked across the cobbles of the Old Church numerous times the previous two days . Yet until Marius pointed it out , we 'd never noticed a bronze life sized breast concreted in amongst the cobbles , a couple of metres from the church doors where the priests walk. Also the single ladies sanctuary was beautiful and so peaceful , the whole block built without a door on the outside , so you can only enter from the inner courtyard garden, through an alley , therefore differentiating the occupants and their homes from the many 'doors' nearby. We d never have found it or entered the two tiny churches inside the garden courtyard without Marius . We 'd seen the helicopter flying over the city very low all weekend , Marius explained they fly a grid daily with thermal imaging looking for drugs.You can buy, sell or smoke it , but you can't grow it, people have cannabis farms in their attics but are soon caught . A pilot first noticed the snow had melted on certain roofs as he flew over the city , so the drug patrol began , very successfully a few year ago .Talking to people back home who've visited Amsterdam , they are amazed at what we've seen and learnt and they had no inkling of any of it .So do join Marius , best bit , you pay at the end whatever you think he was worth , you cant lose , enjoy ."

It's so thin in width), etc. His approach to the tour progressively becomes a pop quiz, which inadvertently forces you to pay attention. He even treated us to a quick Dutch aged-cheese snack (great sustenance for the 2 hour trek). Tim is an excellent tour guide and will instill in you a confidence to roam the beautiful streets of Amsterdam like you're a local. If you get the chance to, donate him a neat \u20ac20...well worth it."

I was not planning to take a walking tour , as I missed my flight and had to find how to spend the day , till I could fly out of Amsterdam . On a very windy and cold day , decided to go to Dam square to visit a museum and get away from the cold wind . Was trying to find my directions and noticed a very smart looking lady holding a sign FREE walking tours . The lady standing in the middle of Dam square , later I got to know her name Britt , on a very windy morning said that the tour would start in about 15 minutes and I could join even if I had not booked . I was not expecting much from a free tour , but was pleasantly surprised that the tour guide had perfect English and knowledge of the history and the different locations as we were expertly guided around the streets to a number of tourist attractions for the next 2 or 3 hours. I would recommend anyone visiting Amsterdam , to start his holiday with this short walking tour , to get a good background of the highlights of the tourist attractions . The tour guide was very informative and answered all the questions , even on matters which may not have been relative to the locations we were walking thru .This was my first unplanned walking tour and will look for walking tours in other cities if they prove to be as good as this one . Will be back in Amsterdam , on a less windy day , and spend a few more days to experience this very interesting city . Thank you Britt ."

The organisation was good; being NY Eve they guessed they would have lots of punters so two guides were on hand and they split the group. Really enjoyed the almost two and a half hours. I thoroughly recommend it."

Meeting point was at Dam Square and it was quite clear of the guide but didn't know his name. I went by myself and our group were taken around by Marius. He was very engaging and entertaining. As we were waiting for others to turn up he asked where we were all from and had something to say to keep conversation flowing.The tour was around the RLD. Not gonna lie, I had a different perspective of the RLD before going. The history was very interesting and we were taken around to a lot of different places. It actually got tiring towards the end of the tour.Marius took us down small alleys, which I would never have thought to go down and it was very unusual to see women at the windows in broad daylight. Knocking on the windows to get your attention - it was actually a little awkward!The purpose of the Free tour is that you tip whatever you feel it is worth. The general rate is between 10-20 Euros. This means the tourguide needs to give a good tour in order to get good tips."

Thanks to him we had great fun as a group of strangers. I had been in Amsterdam many times before that but the details that Tim explained was very interesting and fun. Even I had a tour before, Tim's view of the city was unique and brief. I definitely advise to choose Tim if you are planning a walking tour."

The thing is that we had previously taken part in free walking tours in other city and we were never disappointed. But the tour with Marius offered poor historical explanations of almost all the spots selected, somewhat a disappointment if you would like to know more about this beautiful city. To me it felt more like a friend showing around the city, which can be cool, but it should not be compared with a tourist guide. There are other companies offering free walking tours of the city, I would suggest to look for them, even if I don't know if they are better,"

In order to get a handle of this city I think a tour such as this is the perfect way to do it! Our guide was an Aussie by the name of Julian and he was a very humourous and informed guide - he has lived in the city for the last 5 or 6 years and has really got to know the place. The tour took us through the history of Dutch tolerance, the massive wealth accumulated by the Dutch East India Company, and how the city functions with the legalisation of soft drugs and prostitution. He showed us to some of the main sites and we certainly got our money's worth (a tip to the guide) from this 3 hour tour! He even showed us where we could get traditional Dutch food afterwards which was delicious. I highly recommend the Free Walking Tours of Amsterdam if you want to try and make sense of a fascinating city."

It was a very personal experience."

I'm not much of a planner when it comes to travel, especially when I'm traveling by myself, so the first thing I do when I get to a new city is look for a guided walking tour. This one was fantastic. The guide seemed to really enjoy being a tour guide, and we walked around some really nice areas of Amsterdam. She gave a lot of good information about the city, and was very knowledgeable when answering questions. I definitely recommend this."

The tour is a good way to know the history, the culture and the traditions of the city of amsterdam. It provides an honest, intellectual and authentic experience of the city. The tour gives you a feel for what Amsterdam actually is and how it became what it is today and the guide also throws in some useful tips. Tim is absolutely amazing, the best guide I have ever had. He tells you amazing things and makes everything really funny. Unlike other guides does not keep advertising. I fell guilty to have tipped him less. Next time Tim."

They were pretty easy to spot as they were carrying bright orange umbrellas with them. There were different guides speaking different languages and we took the English tours by Robin. Robin was really very good. She was enthusiastic, funny, entertaining and very knowledgeable. We had a great time with her. Thank you for this wonderful experience!"

My only word of caution is that this tour goes through the red light district (not sure if this is clearly spelled out on the website?) and you will see scantily dressed girls in their windows - working. If you have children or others in your party who are uncomfortable with this, you might want to consider another tour. Otherwise, I highly recommend it."

We went around on a Monday morning with Ami, who was very good and gave us a good mix of history and entertainment, visiting a number of places we just wouldn't have seen if we hadn't gone on the tour, although some of the stories about the red light district were a bit close to the mark. All in all, well worth a couple of hours of anyone's time. There was a good mix of ages in the group, the walking pace was very relaxed and the whole thing was easy going."

Gianni, our guide, was deeply knowledgable about Amsterdam's history and culture and conducted our tour with great warmth and energy. He shared information that covered the highlights of this extraordinary city's establishment and development over many centuries as our group traversed the city on foot. My only disappointment lay in Gianni's failure to mention The Netherland's major role in the enslavement of Africans and the extent to which the Dutch participation in the slave trade made much of the country's great wealth possible during the 17th and 18th centuries.That said, the tour was wonderfully comprehensive, well paced and well organized. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone traveling to Amsterdam. The 'pay what you wish' ethos that governs this company makes the tour accessible to literally everyone but it is certainly worth as much as any other tour offered by companies with fixed rates.The tour is long so wear comfortable shoes, take some water with you and say yes to the stroopwaffels that Gianni offers when you take a break midway through!"

Can book but most just turned up and looked fro the umbrella. Billed as free but everyone voluntarily gave a tip of 10-20 Euros. Took 2.5 hours, at a slow pace."

Always willing to listen and answer questions. She took us to the most interesting locations around Amsterdam and gave us a potted history of the city as we went. We learned a lot on the way round, something you don't get in as much detail on the boat trips.If you only have time for one, take a FreeDam Tour with Ami.You will not be disappointed."

I booked two spots prior to the tour, though I think it is not necessary as Sergio accepted all people who showed up at the meeting point to join the tour. Even though he told us that the tour usually takes up to 4 hours, it lasted for approx. 2.5 hours as he had to do both tours this day (11 AM and 2 PM).I am so thankful I booked with FreeDam Tours. We had so much fun, got great insights into Amsterdam's history, many interesting facts about the city, and fun anecdotes of Sergio's experiences. Sergio is a great guide. You can feel that he is Dutch with passion and loves to tell about his hometown. I highly recommend FreeDam Tours to everybody who wants to get insider information about the city, its history, and its people."

Sergio was very very informative, interesting, and fun.... gave as insight into Amsterdam that we certainly didn't get from the hop on/off tours or guidebooks. As our group was about 15 or so, Sergio was able to satisfy all our little queries. Covered areas that are not the usual touristy ones. Though the area covered is not that much, be prepared to be on your feet for a couple of hours...so comfy shoes are a must. Definitely worth doing if you have an afternoon to spare in Amsterdam, rather than wandering about on your own.."

Someone is trying to sell you something, or there is some other motive.Every once in a while, however, someone is so confident in the service they are offering, that they are willing to leave the compensation in your hands. That is the case here with Sergio.Sergio is a very knowledgeable former geography teacher from Amsterdam with a vast knowledge of the city. He grew up here. His technical knowledge, along with his his sense of humor, and genuine passion for what he is doing, makes this a fantastic way to spend a couple of hours.Sergio will take you to see some sites of historical or geographical interest, but some that also hold a special place in his heart and memories. This give the tour a very personal touch.He conducts the tour for tips. A bold move, since if you are not good, you will not make much money.

Although I have been to amsterdam around 10 times before and done walking tours here before I still learnt a few new things and visited hidden places I didn't know about such as the headquarters for the Dutch east India company. Great tour that I would recommend to anyone!"

At first I was worried that we wouldn't be able to hear or see much but this was not the case at all, Sebastian always made sure we could and also tried to keep everyone in the shade and where possible places to sit down. He was more than accommodating!! In terms of the tour itself it took 2.5 hours and started near the old church and ended in the dam. It was a tip based tour and he stated most paid tours are \u20ac15 but he was happy to accept whatever you felt it was worth - we gave \u20ac10 each, some gave way more and others way less! He gave us a waffle mid tour to give us a boost and also a postcard at the end - very kind!! Sebastian was very informative and has a wide span of knowledge!! It was clear he loved his job and put lots of effort in to make it fun and enjoyable!! Talked just the right amount and showed us many different places and things that you otherwise never would have known like why the houses lean forward and why they all have hooks. Could not have asked for a better tour! Thank you Sebastian! Highly recommend to everyone!!"

There were about 20 of us in the group and we managed not to lose anyone throughout the whole tour. Gianni was very knowledgeable about the city and the history and he was also very enthusiastic. Occasionally found it a little hard to hear him, however this was not his fault, Amsterdam is just a very busy city. It's a great way to get an introduction to the city and get a feel for what else you may want to see. The tour doesn't cover everything in Amsterdam (being only 2.5 hours), but Gianni was happy to give advice on what else we could see. Best thing is that it costs whatever you want it to. So if you do go on the tour and don't have a good time, then just don't pay!"

Sergio's walking tour offers a perfect over view of Dutch history, culture and the origin of the philosophy of tolerance all told with incredible humor and passion.

Sergio weaves personal stories into his historical narrative that leave you with memories of having made a new friend in Amsterdam that you look forward to visiting again, and hopefully soon!

With his easy-going attitude and personal stories this tour was very fresh and definitely something for everyone - young, old and families. I've been to Amsterdam a few times already but never did a guided tour, so I now know a lot more.Great tour, would recommend it to anyone!"

Furthermore we didn't want this uninspired \"follow the umbrella\" tour with a large group of people. Our guide was Sebastian who intruduced himself at the beginning of the tour and he invited us to introduce ourselfs to the group which made it more personal to every member of the tour. He made it very interesting and told some anekdotes from his life in Amsterdam. Also he gave us good recommandations for restaurants and boat tours! Thank you for the enjoyable tour!"

I recently relocated to stay in Amsterdam.Today I wanted to do something different. I wanted to NOT do the tourist thing. Being new in Amsterdam, I am still very much exploring everything this city has to offer. Today I had a tour with a guy called Sergio, from Freedam Tours. I just did a Google search and his ratings where some of the highest. And Trip Advisor recommended him. On his website he advertised focusing more on the historical freedom and tolerance of the Dutch Culture, as opposed to all the normal tourist and museums,and Sergio brilliantly delivered on that.He intermixed his own personal experiences growing up and living in Amsterdam, with history and culture, and on this tour today, we did everything from how the red light district came to be, to how the Catholic Church was involved in prostitution, to modern day live. I can honestly not remember, feeling for one second, that I was bored. His humorous look at past events, combined with his own experiences, made this a very very memorable tour, and better than anything you will ever find in a history book or normal tour. What was nice about the tour, and I might be wrong, is that a lot of the history Sergio told us about, or a lot of the little hidden gems, might not be on a mainstream tour. It would bethings that only the locals would know about. Or the darker part of Dutch history that is left out of mainstream tours for convenience sake. He explained stuff to us very professionally and patiently. The tour took a little longer than anticipated, but no one cared, and everyone LOVED IT. I was honestly a bit disappointed when the tour was finished, because time went by so fast! There wasn't a dull moment. You can see that he loves what he is doing, with a fiery passion.And I have a lot of respect for him, because this is not a paid upfront tour, he works for tips only. So trust me when I say, he is bloody brilliant, very knowledgeable, and this will be one of my fondest memories of Amsterdam to date."

The tour started at 2pm and lasted for around 3 hours. Along the way, he explained to all of us the tolerance of the Dutch culture, some historical tales for the city and the architecture of the houses along the canal belt, with some personal experiences here and there throughout the tour. He is very passionate in leading the tour and the excitement in his tone kept us all engaged for the whole session.I would recommend this tour for visitors upon their arrival here in Amsterdam, so that they have a better picture of the city before exploring it on their own."

FreeDam tours is an exceptionally well organised tour which combines interesting information about the origins of Amsterdam with tips and advice about modern day attractions. Sergio's extensive knowledge of the history and geography of Amsterdam is underpinned by his background as a teacher as well as his experience as a native. I haven't been on many walking tours before but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it as an experience. A lot of the information was genuinely fascinating and the personal anecdotes from Sergio brought a really fun balance to the tour. Additionally the tour is free to attend (hence the name) and I really admire the ethos of this business - as well as Sergio for making the career switch from teaching - in that you can choose to pay what you think the tour is worth. It is quite a lengthy tour (around 2.5 hours) so I think it's hard to overlook Sergio's expertise and ability to be able to produce and deliver such an informative tour."

My best friend and I are doing a tour around Europe and were in Amsterdam for only three days. We only had one day to do walking tours, so we chose Freedam Tours because it seemed to be the most comprehensive- and it definitely was! In just three hours, we saw mostly all the highlights of the city we wanted to see and came away knowing tons of awesome facts! Sergio was so nice too, he even brought some Amsterdam-themed snacks for our group so we could get a taste of Amsterdam! And he gave us all free postcards at the end. Such nice little personal touches :) He also had visual cards with pictures to add to his tour, which I thought was a cool touch that we hadn't gotten on any other walking tour. It definitely enhanced the experience. If you want one tour that covers it all- definitely do Freedam Tours!"

The tour winds through Amsterdam - the Dam, Red Light District, University, Canal District. The points of interest range from historical to modern day cultural, even with some fun, personal anecdotes along the way. You leave feeling really well acquainted with the city. Recommend doing this on your first day! Because Sergio works for himself, he really adds something to the experience. It's the exact opposite of the \"mass produced\" tours. He carries pictures and maps to give some context to the history. Had a ton of personal Amsterdonian stories. He even gave us a snack mid way through! I visited Amsterdam with my brother and sister in law. We had a jam-packed few days in this amazing city. At the end we recounted our \"highlights and lowlights\". Sergio and FreeDam tours was the highlight for all three of us!"

Being an almost-broke student and alone, i decided to give it a go. Needless to say, i was not disappointed! Really good mix of culture, history and a bit of personal stories, which i thought was really interesting to give you insight into the local's culture. Later when i went for a \u20ac16 canal cruise, the audio guide pretty much told us the same stories (but yknow, what are stories without the human touch). I was taken care of by Sergio and the different people from various nationalities i met in the group (they constantly look around for me bcs i was too busy taking pictures i almost got ran over by the crazy Amsterdam bicycle ghostriders). Pretty impressive considering the fact that he just started doing the tour quite recently. I'd say that the standard is pretty much the same, if not better, compared to other free tours that i've joined in other cities. Overall, a really good experience and intoduction to this lovely city."

A guide can really make or break the experience and in this case, Terry nailed it. Not only extremely knowledgeable, Terry was clear, loud and funny in his delivery of an engaging story woven from the the first Dutch settlers through WWII and the present. He kept our small group moving and grooving despite some rain and had a perfect mix of historical relevance with contemporary times. Highlights for me: Rembrandt's Guild, giant wooden animatronics from the Middle Ages and15th century buildings along our route one would otherwise walk right by-- without giving too much away, this tour has something for everyone! Extremely high value for the cost and definitely an awesome way to spend a morning!!"

Based on reviews and availability (we needed to book the tour on a Sunday) we choose WOW tours. We took the tour at the end of Nov. on a rainy day. Not a time when there is a lot of demand for walking tours so we were lucky enough to have the tour and Terry to ourselves. Terry was very laid back and extremely informative. He was happy to answer all our questions and knew a lot about the city. When it started raining a lot we ducked into a cafe, had tea and talked more about his life and what it is like raising a family in the Netherlands and coming from another country. He is originally from Ireland. It was fascinating to learn his perspective. Terry is a professionally storyteller/actor so is able to talk in a way that was very entertaining as well as interesting. I would highly recommend this tour. Fun to learn more about the city with each visit! Terry is a great guy and feel luck we were able to spend an afternoon with him in Amsterdam."

He is was very much aware of his group at all times. As we also did tour of RLD with him. Since it rained the day we were doing the walking tour, and we had the RLD schedule for that same evening. He suggested maybe we would like to rearrange schedule and do RLD another day. We did and the weather was better. Suggest you take RLD tour with Terry...friends did it on their own...and in no way did they have the same experience...we felt safe at all times.

He took very good care of us and kept us all together as it was very crowded that day walking around.  If you are looking for a walking tour of the city, by all means book early as he only does small groups. I think we had 10 in our group so it was easy to hear what our guide had to say! Cheers and gave a great day!"

M and I were visiting Amsterdam for the first time and have always found walking tours to be a good way to find your feet in a new place, so we booked a tour with Terry before we left home.There was just us and one other couple, and so we walked around the city more like you would with a friend than a big tour group. Terry has lived in the city for ten years and has obviously learnt a lot about the city and the Netherlands in general. We found the tour very informative and fun too as Terry has typical Irish storytelling skills. The tour was just over three hours and this included a short break in a caf\u00e9. I think this was just right - long enough to cover most of the city's main sights but not too overwhelming. A great introduction to Amsterdam!"

We knew we only had a few days in Amsterdam and we wanted to experience as much as we could in that timeframe and Terry was instrumental in helping us do that.

She knew so much about the city and the rich history and had endless stories to share. We wandered around for about 3 1/2 hours, stopping for a quick coffee during a short rain storm, and saw so much. I learned quite a bit and had a great time in doing so. I would highly recommend booking this tour! One tip-the group met right in front of the WWII memorial statue. It's a small group and can be a little tricky to find so I just asked a larger tour group's guide and they helped me find my group. Just ask around if you can't find them!

Terry had fabulous and interesting facts and showed us hidden little gems. It was the hottest day on record for Amsterdam and Terry was great about finding us shade and cooler little corridors to walk through on this tour. Even better was his great Irish accent, which added another fun layer to his stories. Truly an amazing tour guide and really by far one of the best walking tours we have been on throughout our numerous European vacations."

Terry was patient enough to give them directions(though meeting point was simple to find) as they were travelling via a car. Rest all were on time. He was also patient enough to let everyone click pics and also kept the group together in an impressive manner. He gave in-depth explanation(even about RLD) about all places as well as answered all our questions of various kinds. The tour ended near Anne Frank House after 4 hrs. At the end, he also gave other tips like where to stay, eat etc."

He collected us on time from our houseboat, and in more than 90 minutes of strolling around, gave us a real insight into the history, politics, business and shady side. As two mature married couples who wouldn't normally do this sort of thing, having a tour guide saying 'look at this' just gives permission and removes all embarrassment from wandering the red light district. The tour included some dark cramped alleys that were perfectly safe, but would have be intimidating without a guide. It's also good to know the difference between red and purple lights. The tour didn't include actually going in any peep shows, sex shops or the sex museum, which saved getting too sordid, but if that's your thing, you will know where to go after.Terry's a really likeable Irishman who has been resident in Amsterdam quite a while, so understands the local culture. He does daytime tours of the city too, so can talk about the history too. In the tour of the RLD, the presentation was positive and up-beat, but he didn't shy away from the talking about the negatives.So glad we did this on our first night. We invited Terry to dinner and he was an amiable dinner guest too."

My husband & I booked our tour directly through Terry (he was recommended to us by another tour operator who could not accommodate us) and ended up being the only people on his tour on a Saturday morning in January. I love the fact that he only does small groups so he can tailor the tour to you. We ran a few minutes late, but Terry patiently waited for us at the monument. As this was our first time in Amsterdam, we wanted to do this tour as early as possible in the trip so that we could get a feel for the city & decide where to focus our time later.Terry didn't disappoint in that capacity. He walked us all over the city & shared very interesting stories throughout its history. My favorites parts of the tour were the Jewish Quarter and the walk to Anne Frank's house because he provided a lot of historical perspective about this sad time period. Midway through the tour we stopped for a hot drink to warm up. Great part about traveling in January is the lack of crowds but it is cold! We also stopped in a gourmet cheese shop for samples of amazing cheeses. Highly recommend doing that!Terry is a very funny guy so it was easy to listen to him. We felt like the tour was a good value & wouldn't hesitate to recommend him as a tour guide!"

It is undeniable that Terry, the tour guide and owner of WOW tours, has a lot of knowledge about Amsterdam\u2019s history, culture, legends and the best tips that provided us with a very good tour. Also, if you don\u2019t have a lot of free time in the city, this is a great way of getting to know the hotspots in 3 hours or so.I just sensed that the specific day I chose to take the tour, Terry was a bit tired and maybe anxious to get it over with, which surprised me after reading all the excellent reviews he has. Well, I suppose we cannot have 100% of excellent days, so I would still recommend his tour."

Terry met us at Dam Square where we were joined by one other traveler. Terry is knowledgable, funny and sensitive to the needs of his small group, a natural story teller. The duration of the tour seemed right. We had a nice stop at a local coffee and pastry shop in the middle just when we needed it. We visited the highlights and also got important recommendations for the remainder of our week. With Terry's e mail address, we also communicated with him once after our tour with a question he quickly answered.

Booking with a knowledgeable private guide like Terry is really the perfect way to ensure that your tour is at a pace that works for you and includes sights that will ensure that everyone in the group gets to see something that interests them.

That way, we were able to pick his brain for restaurant recommendations and other activities that we could explore on our own."

Booked the classic walking tour & red light district tour with Terry. As we travelled from Asia and with the limited time that we had, we proceeded with the walking tour exactly 4 hours after our touchdown in Amsterdam. We were worried that we will be too tired physically & mentally to enjoy what the city has to offer within such a short time.All these changed when we met Terry at our hotel lobby. He was witty, charming & very professional not to mention his knowledge of the history, legends & trivias of the city. We were entertained throughout the tour with stories & loads of information...all presented in the most entertaining way by Terry with great humour. Even a non history buff will find his tour interesting. Terry can offer a something that local tour guides can't, the valuable viewpoint & insight of a seasoned tourist in Amsterdam, and as first timers here, we felt 'understood' by Terry.The red light district tour was sweet & exciting, as if we were to walk on our own..all we can see are scantily dressed women & a ghetto-like area. Terry brings us deep into the heart of the district where we wouldn't have dared venture on our own..no matter how safe the district is..also there are more to this area then sex trade. Terry will enlighten and bring the best of the district's landmarks coupled with stories & myths for tourists to enjoy.We left Amsterdam feeling satisfied as we managed to see so much within such a short time frame..without feeling rushed..and we even have time to go on a wonderful tour visiting the outskirts of Amsterdam. Terry has been really kind to arrange an excellent guide for this tour. All in all 2 magical days in Netherlands.Will definitely look for Terry again the next time we go back to Amsterdam!"

My family of 6 (children 14,16,18,20) were in Amsterdam for only three days at the end of June 2013, As always, when planning a trip, I contacted TripAdvisors top rated tour services. Terry's Wow Tours immediately stood out from all the other companies with his quick and insightful responses to any inquiry I might have. He was also very flexible, in working around our flight schedules and combining and tailoring tours to meet our needs. Terry arranged for all airport transfers. He provided the name and cell phone number of the driver ahead of time. The driver, Marcel, was very professional, prompt, and an excellent driver. The vehicle was clean, and new.  Since we only had 3 days in Amsterdam we tried to cram as much as we could into each day. Terry came up with a perfect itinerary to meet our needs. We did the \"Story of Amsterdam\" (SOA) tour but also added the WWII and Jewish district to it as well. After the SOA tour briefly introduced the red light district, I felt more comfortable scheduling the evening \u201cRed Light Experience\u201d Tour for my family. Terry cleared his schedule, and took us out the following evening. We also did the Food/ Jordan Market Tour. Terry kept the tours fresh and interesting. He was both entertaining and informative. Terry helped to make the most every minute. We all enjoyed ourselves immensely."

However, my husband and I had reservations about walking the Red Light District, let alone doing so with our two children who are in their early 20s. Although the Red Light District was safer than expected, as we learned on our tour, we were glad we walked the District with Terry! On our own we would have only seen the many scantily clad women (and a few men), and missed out on the history and interesting facts about the District. To simply say that Terry is a people person does not do him justice. Terry quickly understood our family, our family dynamics, and comfort level with the subject matter, and tailored the tour to our taste. While my 23-year old daughter and 22-year old son initially questioned my judgement in booking Terry's tour, suspecting it would be awkward to take such a tour with the parents, Terry immediately put us all at ease with his great wit and professionalism. Terry shared his knowledge of the District, which included facts about the economics and safety of the workers, security and every-day life in the District, and history of the development of the Red Light District.I highly recommend a Red Light District tour with Terry for all tourists of an appropriate age. It is a personal decision for parents to determine the appropriate age for their children. Had my kids been as young as 16, I would have felt comfortable on a family tour with Terry. While the subject matter is for mature audiences, and some girls were dressed in a way that left little to the imagination, Terry was professional and informative, and in no way crass or inappropriate. Terry's tour was one of the highlights of our trip. We have taken dozens of tours on our family vacations and Terry is among our favorite tour guides!"

There were 17 adults in the group and Terry was recommended to us from friends that had taken the tour before. From the first email inquiry to the afternoon he met us in our hotel he was very professional. Terry had arranged a 3hour tour around the city centre that was both informative and funny. He was a fountain of knowledge and took time to ensure that everyone was included. I would have no hesitation in recommending a tour, if you are two people are a group Terry is the WOW in WOW Tours."

We landed in the early hours of a Saturday morning in February and rushed straight to Dam square for the tour. From start to finish, the tour was fantastic. We were visiting out of peak time, so our group was very small (there were just 5 of us) and Terry really catered to our every need. Terry who is originally from Ireland has been living in Amsterdam for a number of years and knew a huge amount about the city and and its history. He was willing to answer all manner of questions about all the areas we walked through.The tour allowed us to see all important areas of the city and meant that during our short stay there we felt confident to explore the city on our own during our stay.Great value for money- I would definitely recommend this!!"

We had a small group, only 4 people and it allowed a very leisurely pace, complete with a coffee break part way through! He was incredibly knowledgable and funny, and managed to show us the sights, as well as educate us on the history, politics, and culture of Amsterdam through a compelling narrative. I would highly recommend Wow Tours for anyone visiting Amsterdam as Terry finds a way to make the most boring or complicated fact interesting, funny, and memorable! The best are his opinions on the various statues and monuments in Amsterdam."

Terry's easy personality made the semi private 3-hour tour relaxing and pleasurable. The time flew by as we walked from Dam Square through the Red Light District, where we stopped several times with explanations of what we were seeing as well as interesting and fun little tidbits of info. We continued on to Rembrandt Huis and the Jewish Quarter, afterwards taking a quick break at a local cafe, followed by more sites that included how and why's of canals, the Catholic and Protestant Church histories, the Dutch East India Company, through the Amsterdam Museum pass, the Royal Palace and finally ending at the Anne Frank Huis. Terry pointed out many other interesting things as we moved from site to site (too many to mention all) and included personal experiences as well as information he gathered from patrons of his previous tours. My husband and I were definitely WOWed by Terry and his amazing Tour!"

He is able to relate various places of interest to people from other countries in a way that shows the diversity of this country's makeup. The history of the city combined with the political and modern overtones gave a wonderful picture of this magnificent city. I would highly recommend this tour to all visiting Amsterdam.

We had booked a tour for three of us on a Sunday morning. We had booked online at the last minute because of doubts about our flight to Amsterdam.The booking arrangements were clear and straightforward. However apparently the guide originally booked for the tour was taken ill and the tour had to be rearranged for the Sunday afternoon. Amsterdam City Tours tried to make several attempts to contact us but were unable to do so because we were in transit. When the three of us turned up on Sunday morning we were still met on time by a substitute guide and he took just the three of us on the city tour. Not only did we see all the main city centre sights but also the less common buildings. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the city and its history and the history of its buildings. He was clearly really enthusiastic about the city. With just three of us the guide could easily have rushed us round but he did not - in fact the tour lasted well beyond the three hours advertised. Amsterdam is an easy city to walk round but wearing sturdy shoes would be sensible. A camera is a must and if you have got a voice recorder better still because you are given so much information in a relatively short space of timeand it is difficult to remember everything. We had one refreshment stop but the impression was that we could have had more if we wished. All in all this was a great morning's tour and we were lucky with the weather - it may not have been such fun if it had been raining."

We were quickly in the country, with charming old villages strung along the tops of the dikes. It was a nice and well-guided tour, not strenuous at all. The tour company limits tours to 12 people max, a nice size. The break in the middle in the tiny village of Holysloot was lovely - excellent pastries, coffee, and hot chocolate; small birds stealing biscuit crumbs; a cow studying us just over the fence. The bikes are rentals (not owned by the tour company) so make sure everything is adjusted to your liking before you take off. "

His English was fluent - to the extent of describing much of the architecture as 'wobbly' and then giving the reasons for this (boggy foundations).We toured the city centre but also explored round some impressive residential areas, & the local park before he led us through the Van Gough museum...a long held cyclists' right to ride 'through' the museum ...at a reconstruction cost of millions of pounds!Jasper's tour included a coffee break at a delightful caf\u00e9 where we were greeted like old friends.

For me, if was the best day I've had in ages! I found myself more relaxed and present than I've been in months. We had beautiful weather. It was a stunningly beautiful route. Our tour guide was delightful and went above and beyond to ensure we all had a great, safe, scenic time. I cannot recommend this tour company highly enough, and I know for a fact we will use them again our next trip to Amsterdam."

After spending four hours on this bike tour I can definitely see why this company is so highly recommended!!Huge shout out to \"Charlotte\" who was our tour leader / bike master, who was absolutely outstanding!!The bikes while heavy are easy to ride and well maintained big tip ask questions if your not sure about anything because it's easily assumed otherwise.Good stretches of riding on this tour which is fantastic so your not stopping and starting all the time which I really enjoyed.The countryside component is stunning especially the cross country component which I thought was a hoot!!All in all this was a great afternoon of riding and sightseeing with a great group of people. This is a bike tour group I'd definitely do again!!!"

The rental bikes were in good condition and our guide was fantastic. The route was scenic (in Amsterdam North) along the water and into/through small villages. We would stop periodically for quick tidbit sharing (and for a break) and then continue biking. Also stopped to get some delicious apple pie and cheese cake about halfway through.The trip was 19 miles in total so be prepared if you haven't biked in a while. Don't worry too much though, there was not a single hill during the entire ride. The biggest inclines were small bridges that cross over the waterways.Would definitely do this trip again with these guys, they run a tight operation!"

I haven't been on a bike in about 15 years, but it turns out you really don't forget how to do it! It was a great introduction to Amsterdam and the biking culture there. Thijs was our guide, and he explained many things about Amsterdam, including some architectural features that we had wondered about (all those hooks, the sloping buildings, etc.) Plus we got to see Dam Square - which we hadn't yet visited - cycle through the Vondelpark (beautiful!) and through the Rijksmusuem. The tour had occasional breaks to show some courtyards and other interesting highlights, so we didn't bike the whole time. Thijs is very knowledgeable and relaxed, and it was a very comfortable, enjoyable tour. Amsterdam is a very flat city (other than the bridges!) which makes for easy biking. A good part of the tour was spent along the canals and side streets which were not super packed with people, which made for a very enjoyable, easygoing ride. I definitely recommend this tour!"

We saw dikes, small towns, farms and the obligatory windmill.

As the morning progressed, things did pick up. Amsterdam is a bike city- and people are aggressive on their bikes- so you do need to be prepared for that- especially if you are with kids or someone who isn't quite as comfortable on a bike. Also- they don't wear helmets. So- be aware of that as well as you don't get a helmet on this tour. I would definitely recommend.

Thijs was really good with combining substantial history and cultural information at various stops along the way. I enjoyed so much that I decided to take the city tour the next day. My family didn't join me (went to Van Gogh Museum instead) as they were concerned about traffic in Amsterdam. Although many parts of Amsterdam look scary for inexperience riders, this tour took a path that didn't have any intimidating parts. Jasper was energetic and really educated us about Amsterdam and the Dutch Culture. Really put a lot of things together. It was a rainy day, but that didn't seem to matter. Took a little longer coffee break and Jasper just extended the time so we covered everything. Been on many city bike tours and this one is definitely top notch!"

Beautiful tour of one of the parks, nice break for drinks, lots of information about the city. Don't worry about your confidence biking in this city ... Phillip cycles at your pace and makes sure everyone is safe. Bring some money for drinks and a bit to tip him at the end. Nice that bikes are included with the rental.

We also stopped at the very old village of Ransdorp where we climbed the bell tower of the old church, and one of our final stops was at a unique windmill. Charlotte was mindful of the varying experiences among our riders and showed lots of patience and gave clear instructions.The riding on both tours was quite easy and Charlotte and Philip spoke excellent English so it was easy to have our questions answered along the way and receive suggestions at the end of out tours.

The tour was very relaxing and beautiful countryside that you wouldn't believe existed if you only stayed in Amsterdam City. The tour was approximately 30kms long but completely flat so easy riding. I would thoroughly recommend this tour to get away from the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam and see a different side. Thank you Jasper for a great tour"

Frank was our tour guide and he was informative and took us to places that we never would have visited on foot. He gave us a thorough history of the city. A few things to note (these aren't necessarily negative aspects of the tour, but things that I think they're worth mentioning):-I've been on some bike tours that stop frequently for photo-ops. This tour is primarily biking with just a few stops. I wasn't bothered by it because we did the tour at the beginning of our stay and used it to help us decide which places to revisit. -Be warned that the traffic in Amsterdam is very intimidating depending on where you are from. I almost got hit by a train, but that seems to be a common occurrence there! I'm from California where we have very strict laws for pedestrians and cyclists, so it was difficult at times to navigate people and bikes coming from all directions at all times. Again, that is no fault of the company. But I do feel like it's worth noting that biking in that city isn't always leisurely (though there were parts that were relaxing!). -If you aren't a somewhat experienced biker, a bike tour may not be a good idea for you. There were a couple of girls on our tour that really struggled because they couldn't get on and off the bikes quickly and they couldn't navigate the tight spaces. It is fun if you can ride a bike, but stressful if you cannot!"

I'd read some really positive reviews on Trip Advisor so we booked in advance online, which was quick and easy. We arrived at the meeting point in Dam Square at 10am where we met Julia, who was our guide for the day. After a short walk we collected our bikes and we were on our way. Amsterdam is such an interesting city with wonderful architecture and a fascinating history, which Julia really brought it to life for us. We visited lots of significant points of interest as we navigated our way around the vibrant city streets. The 3 hour city tour went by in a heartbeat and the smiling faces of my wife and children said it all. I couldn't give this tour a higher recommendation and would say it's a must for anyone visiting Amsterdam for the first time. A big thank you to the charming Julia, and to her colleagues Jasper and Thijs, for making our first day so memorable."

While my husband attended his conference one day I decided to take a bike tour of the countryside. I had some reservations about doing this tour because of the long distance and going by myself. Even though I was last in the line during some portions, I kept up and didn't feel like I was slowing anyone down. So even if you're not very fit, or an avid biker, you can do this ride. And going alone worked out just great because my co-riders were also happy to be there and very friendly. Frank, our guide, set the tone for a fun, comfortable ride for everyone. He stopped or slowed whenever someone needed to, or when there was a cool spot to talk about. Amsterdam bikers are a brave, steady bunch, and I was shaky when we were pedaling the few blocks on the busy streets to get to the ferry and out of the city, but even that part went smoothly! I highly recommend this group and its country tour if you want to get a good look at the \"real\" Nederland - villages, farms, an old windmill tucked unexpectedly along the bike path, and to learn a bit about the history/geography of the area."

I really enjoyed getting out of the city for a while and seeing such beautiful countryside. You get to go through quaint little villages and stop at this great cafe for coffee/tea and apple pie.One of the things I liked most about the bike trip was the camaraderie with the other bikers. I got to meet and get to know all of the other bikers - a young woman from England, a young woman from Israel, a family from Seattle, Washington, a couple from Australia, and a mother/daughter from Canada. It is a great bonding experience and a way to be a part of a 'community' while abroad. Also, Philip, our guide was fantastic. I highly recommend this bike tour!!!"

To add to what other people have said, a couple tips for people who do the countryside tour:- the cafe they usually stop at isn't open on Mondays. If you go on Monday, you won't have this mid trip stop. Consequently, definitely bring a snack and some water. There is a grocery store right near the bike shop. - put on sunscreen. On a beautiful day you could easily get burned. - wear sneakers. Part of the tour includes biking a well ridden path in a field. Since it's a well ridden path, it's a bit muddy. It's neat to bike through it, but I was also so glad I had sneakers on. - they don't stop as much as other bike tours. You are encouraged to stop when you want to take pictures and they'll slow down so you can catch up, but this tour spends more time biking than some other bike tours. Personally, I really appreciated that!Also, when you are done you get a great email with restaurant recommendations. Recommended!"

            "review": "Fun!. I wanted to see the countryside and given that Amsterdam is a biking city it was a no-brainer to book a bike tour. The tour was about 4-5 hours and approx. 30 km. Pretty flat terrain so an easy bike ride. All of your focus and energy was on the scenery. The guide was great and the whole experience was well worth my time and money.You start off by their shop near the train station. Then you have a short ferry ride over the river and then the real ride begins. Our group of 12 \"followed the leader\" through quaint villages, through farms and by the \"sea side.\" It was beautiful. Our guide stopped us every so often to give us some history of the area. About half way through the trip we stopped at this cute little outdoor restaurant for about 20-30 minutes. They are known for their apple pie - they serve food and drinks as well. You pay for whatever you order (pie was about 4.5 euros, sodas/coffee 2.25 euros - bring cash). We continued the ride (it was a large loop so you didn't really see the same thing twice until you got to the ferry). We did stop at one of the few remaining windmills in Amsterdam and our guide explained to us how they worked and how they were used. Interesting. A great day!As a side note, there was someone on our ride who had done the city bike tour the day before. She loved it so much that she booked this countryside tour for the very next day. I'll need to do the city tour next time I'm in Amsterdam."

This was a great way to get acclimated to the city, and a great introduction to what would be a full week of cycling with and among Amsterdamers. I researched all the other bike tour options in Amsterdam and was very happy to have chosen We Bike Amsterdam for the City Tour. The bikes were great, and super comfortable. Philip was a wonderful tour guide. He was very positive and very passionate about his city, and full of great information and interesting tidbits. I met really nice, friendly people on the tour. The group size was perfect. Highly recommend!"

            "review": "See the Dutch countryside. We did the countryside tour, Frank was the guide for a small group of around 12. The tour was nicely set out, a short ferry ride then we cycled for around an hour and a half with a few stops. The halfway stop was a cute little cafe where we had apple pie. Then we headed back towards the ferry with a couple more stops. I enjoyed the tour and Frank told us some interesting stories but I thought there could have been a few more stops to take photos and appreciate the countryside. The stop at the cafe was very long- around an hour, this was partly due them being very slow with the bill. I understand that's not really the tours fault but I would think perhaps they would have it a bit more down pat if the tour stops there regularly. If you like cycling and want to get away from all the craziness of Amsterdam this tour is a good option. However, there is definitely some room for improvement, hence the 4 out of 5."

I don't know if it was the weather (it rained throughout and poured at one point), the tour route or both but we weren't really \"WOW\"ed. The countryside was great to see but we really couldn't enjoy it because of the rain. We did stop at the windmill and the villages (mentioned on the site) and our guide gave us great information on them. We crossed the bridges and dikes but thought we would get some more information/background on them other than riding across them. The half way stop was needed as that was right after the pouring rain. The spot was really cute and the apple pie was excellent! At the end of the tour we rode for 45mins non-stop, we were thinking that there had to be at least 1 more stop on the way back but it was just riding. The tour overall was just OK, we are glad we did it because it showed a different side of Amsterdam but we really were expecting to see and hear more. The bikes were great and comfy (18.5 miles can be hard on ones bottom!) and the staff were excellent & knowledgeable."

Our group was a total of 9 people and our guide was Thys. He was very kind and told us informative details about the history of Amsterdam. The weather was wonderful and we didn't need our jackets. It was a wonderful way to see what life outside the bustling \"downtown\" Amsterdam; however, at the end of our journey, our legs and knees were sore from the biking. At home, we do not go on long bike rides. We typically only bike within our neighborhood and have never biked 30 km before.The reservation process online was simple and the bikes were excellent quality. We were able to strap our jackets and purses to the bike. I wish we had brought a bottle of water since there were several stops where it would have been nice to have a sip of water. We did enjoy one long break at a cafe and enjoyed some apple pie.Overall, I recommend this tour as a fun way to see the non-touristy side of Amsterdam."

Three generations biked together, ages 70, 69, 45, 41, 39, 38, 4, and 2. Thijs gladly accommodated the two children with seats on the back of the bikes. We stopped for lunch with outdoor seating, which was a nice break to let the children run around. The bikes are high-quality and work well. The terrain is flat enough that those who don't bike regularly could keep up. Very interesting to see the countryside, small towns, canals, dikes, and bike roads. A little bonus is the old windmill at the end of the tour. I recommend this company without hesitation!"

I booked this online the night before and ended up doing the Countryside tour with a family of 4 - with our guide we were a group of 6. They are conveniently located lear the Central Station.The entire tour took us through the country and some small, quaint towns. Completely un-touristy. It was great to see the dijks, rural farms, cows, the architecture and how people legitimately get around by bike. To see for such a long way (because it's so flat) is really amazing.It took about 4 hours, and although we stopped about halfway through for a coffee it didn't seem that long. It was an easy pace and our guide stopped every once in a while to take pictures or to show us something specific or noteworthy.Our guide - Thijs - was great. He set a good pace, he had a lot of interesting things to tell us and knows a lot about his country and its history. We had a good chance to chat with him during the coffee break and he was very personable. It was a really pleasant way to spend some time to get to know the country outside of Amsterdam. I can't recommend this tour group enough."

We had a 5 min walk to the place that we rented the bike from(inc in the tour price) and we started off our journey. We had good, almost new bikes, and we followed our guide to various places around the city. We had a number of stops for our guide to explain to us the history and interesting facts about Amsterdam and its people. During our break we sat at a restaurant and had some coffee and a piece of apple pie. This were things got more interesting... we discussed everything from politics around the world, dutch habits, work, travel.... it was exceptionally fun and almost educational :) We continued on our tour and visited some other interesting places. We cycled back to the rent shop and delivered the bikes. I would say this was one of the most enjoyable things we did in Amsterdam. The pace of the tour was good, never rushed and our guide answered all our questions. And we asked a lot! All in all, well done Svenja! It was a pleasure"

Thijs (our guide) was understanding and by 11:18 we were on our modern and pristine bikes and ready to go. The weather was glorious and it was fantastic to start the tour with a quick ferry hop to north Amsterdam. Thijs gave us good, informative briefings on route, sights and history; other than that he left us to enjoy the ride and chat amongst ourselves. Highlights were the huge Dykes which we enjoyed riding. I personally never imagined I'd be riding a Dyke and it just goes to show you're never to old to try something new. We loved the traditional Dutch houses and pleasant farmland; I got a real sense of what Vincent van Gough himself set out to capture so vividly in his early forays with paint. After around 90 mins we pulled into a quaint little cafe for what was a delicious coffee and apple pie. Back on the bikes we found Herron; Dutch cattle and noisy frogs. The rolling pastures were welcome respite from urban Amsterdam. We crossed another, smaller canal on a tiny little boat. The boatswain was summonsed with the ringing of a bell at the jetty! Fabulous! After another hour or so we reached a magnificent working windmill! What a treat. We hopped back on the bikes for the final half hour ride back to catch the ferry. Our four hours (and c20 miles) flew by. Thijs is a great guide and Amsterdam by bike is a must. Our beers and dinner that night were well earned and appreciated. Although the country tour is suitable for anyone with basic fitness, our bottoms were a little sore the next day, but that's to be expected. Brilliant and highly recommended!"

Our guide was excellent and made sure we were happy and confident with the bikes which were in very good condition and easy to use, and he went over the safe way to ride a bike in Amsterdam. We saw so much of the city which you could never see on foot or on a canal trip and we stopped several times to be given information about the history of Amsterdam and about hidden places. I have done tours like this before and had to persuade my friends who both said it was the highlight of the weekend. I would even recommend this over a canal trip as you learn so much more and go round the tiny back streets as well as seeing the main sights. All in all it seemed a well run and organised company with professional staff who gave great customer service."

I was a little embarrassed having already rented a bike from a competitor (logistical reasons...closer to our hotel) just to get around the city, and I was put at ease in that regard, both through email and at the beginning of the tour. Charlotte did a fabulous job showing us the hidden gems of Amsterdam, sharing many interesting tidbits. At the end of that tour, she recommended areas that we could further explore. Later that day, we were pleasantly surprised to receive an email with favourite restaurants and bars, of which we were able to visit two before returning home. We have already recommended this tour to friends who were also visiting the city."

He cares about his customers and wants to show you the true Amsterdam. 4 of us took the 25mile countryside bike tour and LOVED it. The terrain is flat, bikes are comfortable and scenery is beautiful! We stopped at a quaint cafe for lunch and had fun brainstorming tour ideas. Thijs makes the tour fun and informative. We learned about the country way of life and the canal systems as well as saw animals, boats, and quaint villages. Don't miss this tour or the City tour!"

Phillip put me at ease and the route was mostly very quiet. If you are able, seeing this wonderful city from a bicycle is a unique and thoroughly enjoyable experience. WBA gives you history, trivia, and the local perspective. And, you get a bit of exercise."

Before we started Thijs explained the philosophy of the company he shares with his partner, Jasper. To offer folks a unique look of Amsterdam away from the Hop-On or Hard Rock viewpoint is the purpose of WeBike. It was just us for the day as we headed out on our bikes. It's been a while since we have ridden, and our bottoms definitely felt the outcome. But riding along the dikes and seeing several small villages on the outskirts of the big city was awesome. The day was windy but the rain held off for the 24km ride. We even went back the next day to try for the City tour, but we missed the start of it. Next time."

This is a great ways to see the city!Pros:- You are biking...like a local. It was a nice, efficient way to see the city, feel like you are experiencing the city, and get to the different areas.- It was actually an interesting tour. I have been on bike tours before (e.g. Rome) were the guide is a biker, and you just ride around. This was NOT that. This was a tour. You rode to interesting spots and stopped for an explanation/discussion.- Hit high spots...NOT in the city center. We had done a walking tour of the city center. This takes you away from the city center to other areas. For our family, we liked the areas away from the city center better than the city center. - Guide (Thijs), one of the owners, was really very good. Good interactions with teens. Good knowledge of city. Right temperament. Just well done.- Pictures. The guide took pictures on his phone and sent them to us after the tour. Nice touch!Cons:- Biking in Amsterdam is a serious form of transportation. We have biking in other cities, but would not call ourselves \u201cbikers.\u201d We had no problem. If you are very uncomfortable on a bike, try a walking tour. You do not have to be in good shape, but you do have to know the basics of biking.Recommendations:- Get our guide, if you can. I am sure there are other good guides, but ours was great."

It was absolutely freezing outside but once on the bikes we forgot all about the cold plus we stopped off in a nice little caf\u00e9 in a really nice part of Amsterdam and had coffee and biscuits. After riding trough the gorgeous park we stopped off at museum square and Jasper told us a few facts about the Dutch and their buildings. After riding trough the Rijksmuseum we rode trough the city centre which was great because we felt like one of the locals. We had so much fun on this tour we really didn't want it to end.

I signed up for the tour based on what it mentioned about peeking beyond the tourist bubble and this tour definitely achieved that expectation."

The 10am start isn't too early, but forced us to get up and make a day of it. Our group was only 4 strong, plus the guide who spoke excellent English. He took us down narrow streets and canal sides into little hidden locations that you would not get otherwise. You could never cover the ground on foot (about 12k) and take in the experience at to the same time. If you want to get a great kick start to your city break, I would wholly recommend We Bike Amsterdam!!"

The coffee stop was cute and full of locals.3. The bikes were comfortable and in good shape.4. The guide was knowledgeable and pleasant.5. He covered all the major sites you want to see in Amsterdam plus some smaller details you'd miss if guiding yourself about with a guide book. So, if you're only in town briefly and want a flash tour, this works (I cannot say the same for our tour in Brussels) and if you want to see a bit more, this is also worth your time.I particularly liked the stop at the Dutch West India Company headquarters."

Suddenly saw a group of 50 odd amatuer cyclist on their cycles, burstled on to the scene. The most amazing of it was the variance in age group. Few were pretty young like about 20 yrs and few about 65+, all binded together by passion for cycling. They all had tea and beverages at cafe on streets after long stint with cycling. It was spectacle which you can find aroung amterdam, as they take a pride in cycling. Its thing of prestige!! Simply awesome experience."

So its not just the standard tourist areas covered during this tour. This involved pointing out some of the architectural eras the city had been through, landmark buildings with a bit of history, a cycle through the park and a short coffee break.The city is fairly flat so the ride is not taxing and you'll end of wondering how the 3 hours passed so quickly. Also, the tour leaves promptly at 10am so make sure that you are on time or you might be left behind. If you are using a bus or tram to reach the start Dam Square stop would be your best option but Central station is also not far off.Overall I don't think a visit to Amsterdam would be complete without a bicycle tour and I'd definitely recommend We Bike!"

However, this turned out to be the highlight of my weekend, what an amazing way to see the city - as a local. This was by far a much better experience than the boat tour we went on later, which surprised me as I do love a boat :) Thijs, our guide, was warm, welcoming and made my day. The group consisted of experienced cyclist and a few who were more nervous at first, Thijs was patient and ensured everyone was comfortable. The route was great and took in all the sites and local neighbourhoods. I especially enjoyed visiting the local markets and cycling through Vondelpark, we even got involved in an impromptu tree climb with another group.If you do one thing in Amsterdam, make sure it's we bike Amsterdam - absolutely loved it! I will be back in December with another group of friends and will be sure to do it all over again. See you soon Thijs!"

Having seen the organised chaos on the main roads and some of the other write ups on other bike tours left me feeling not so keen. It was nearly an opportunity missed...we had 3 and a bit hours of pure pleasure.We were given excellently maintained and easy to handle bikes suitable for our heights. (Included in the price) and our group was small (7) and of mixed ages and biking experience. This topped with a fantastic tour guide (Jasper) who was not only knowledgable but also ensured everyone was safe and not left behind left me feeling it was one of the highlights of our week. The city tour included riding predominantly off the main roads through little streets with beautiful facades, gardens and hidden churches and communes. It was everything I'd wanted Amsterdam to be. Even the mid way coffee stop in the atmospheric and cosy cafe was perfectly timed and local. So for those of you who are 'umming and arghing' take the leap and go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed and we for one will definitely be taking a different tour with the same company next time we come. They were efficient, had great communication, excellent value for money and professional at what they they did in a friendly and relaxed manner. "

To be sure, it was a great introduction to biking the streets of Amsterdam and maneuvering through the rest of the bike traffic. But the tour itself was a bit thin. Our guide didn't speak very loudly and didn't give much info I hadn't already read in the guide book. Similarly, many of the \"hidden\" sites on the itinerary should only be a surprise to you if you haven't read anything about the city (or done any sightseeing yet). The Jordaan, Begijnhof, Vondelpark, and Museumsplein are not exactly secrets. We did go inside one interior residential courtyard that we would not have found on our own, which was interesting. And I also loved the bike path that tunnels straight through the middle of the Rijksmuseum, so I give the tour credit for showing that to us. Maybe our experience would've been somewhat better with another guide."

They have three speeds. Jasper, the tour guide was very interesting and spoke very good English. He customized our tour according to our afternoon timetable, and showed us a lot of hidden points of interest that helped to tell the story of historical Amsterdam, and gave insight into modern Amsterdam and it's culture. The ride was relaxing and fun. The rendezvous at the bike rental shop was easy to find. An excellent way to cover a lot of ground without rushing. The weather in early September cool, but being from Canada, we were comfortable in shorts and t shirts."

This bike tour is great for all ages we had a mixed group from early 20s up to mid 50s and we all enjoyed ourselves.Thijs is really enthusiastic about the Amsterdam area, I was very impressed at how he remembered all of our names throughout the ride. We did this tour on the first day of our holiday to get a feel for the area and it really helped. Both my boyfriend and I agreed this bike tour would be gorgeous during the winter months when you're wrapped up in a scarf going down the quant roads in the crisp air. Such great value for money, we tipped at the end but this is not compulsory obviously! I won't give too much away about the routes because it's nicer to experience it yourself Book it!! You won't be disappointed."

The bikes were great, easy to ride and the pace was good, and easy to keep up even for me, a very rusty bike user! we would most definately recommend this experience,it was great value for money!."

The bike tour is a lot more fun than the traditional walking tours and our guide took us to places that are not on most regular tours (my favorite was a hidden garden). There is a 20 minute stop for coffee, which in my opinion was not necessary at all, as the tour is not the long. Despite that, it was an adorable experience."

We travelled through a variety of neighborhoods which gave us an insightful look into the past and present of Amsterdam away from the tourist crowds.

The tour guide (a young German lady with excellent English) was patient with our kids, taught us all we needed to know to ride safely, and really knew her Amsterdam stuff. She showed us amazing historical houses, explained the architecture and took us to all the nooks and crannies we never would have seen on our own.We also rode thru Vondel Park which was quite nice, stopping for drinks (coffee, etc.).It was a bit over 3 hours including all breaks and the time went by really fast - lots of fun.For the \"concerned\" parents out there, no helmets are provided, but statistically Amsterdam is a very safe city to cycle in, has bike lanes all over, and cars give lots of deference to the two-wheeled riders.

I went to Amsterdam for 5 days in June 2015 and decided at least for one day I wanted to ride the city. Doing a little research on Tripadvisor it was suggested local to the hotel I was staying at to do a \"We Bike Amsterdam\" tour. So I booked it a few weeks in advance and finally I arrived in Amsterdam. Getting to where this tour is - is going Central Station Tram and meeting at the Dam stop where there are two statues of Lions there. Jasper and Luke our guide met us there. We had a small group and to be honest I had been warned prior to booking this event NOT to do this due to possible risk of hurting myself. I was alone in Amsterdam on a mini solo trip - female as I was doing business in London prior to. I did not take heed to this warning and will state that THIS WAS one of the best things I did in Amsterdam. I can not tell you how exhilarating I felt biking through this charming city where the bikes rule! I smiled the entire time on this ride for 3 hours. I was at first worried because I have never biked in a city where there was thousands of people, bikes (yes bikes rule here) to people are masses amounts of people but I kept up. Not only did I keep up but I was always pretty much right behind the guide. Luke brought us all over the city to little spots you probably would have never known about passing by and we learned so much. Hidden treasures within the city. The bike was awesome and during some of the ride yes I got a little nervous because you have to navigate through bikes, people, cars, and its all on you- Not the guide. You have to be in control but I did it! We all did it!!!!! Had I known how much I would have loved this I would have done it everyday! I would highly highly recommend this. Luke was awesome. In fact if you want you can rent the bikes from them for the duration of your stay. This was so much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PS. We stopped for tea. It would also be wise to bring a sweater for weather change or rain jacket, and water. A backpack works! I had one :)"

As a native of Amsterdam, Thijs (also our guide) is exceptionally knowledgeable of the area, the culture, the details, the facts and artifacts. He was able to answer our myriad of questions (we asked lots of questions) and he took us to places off of the beaten path (e.g. The Hidden Church, the narrowest house in Amsterdam, etc.) that are not part of the typical \"cookie cutter\" bike tour. The pace of the tour was good, Thijs is focused on safety and also ensured we made several stops for refreshments, breaks, etc. as needed. The quality of the bikes were rode were first rate.

We took the Hidden Gems of Amsterdam tour and would recommend it to anyone with the ability to ride a bike.Our guide, Charlotte, was engaging, funny and spoke great English as she explained our way around the Jordaan and other parts of Amsterdam. She was extremely well informed and gave us some information and recommendations that we never would have heard otherwise. The bikes were modern and comfortable, and we felt safe all the way through the tour - despite Amsterdam's hectic bike lanes, we kept the the quieter areas which inspired confidence. We stopped frequently for explanation and/or water breaks, so the tour is not at all taxing or physically demanding.Bikes are a way of life in Amsterdam and we found them the best way to really see the city, from hidden gardens to the wonderful Vondelpark to the cool Jordaan area. Thanks Charlotte!"

This tour is a great way to uncover Amsterdam in a unique fashion while at the same time getting the feeling of being \"at home\" and belonging - you get a glimpse in the life of your average Amsterdam everyday life - biking along the canals and busy streets.

Extra thanks to Lisa our guide who was friendly and knowledgeable, making our tour infinitely more entertaining. The stop at the cafe in beautiful Vondelpark was much appreciated (we recommend a slice of the apple pie to get you round the second half of the tour!) and the followup e-mail I received from the tour operator had some really good recommendations for other places to visit during our trip. 10/10 A* from us, there is a reason these guys are rating number 1 on Tripadvisor! x"

We booked this tour a week prior. When we got to town and our flight was slightly delayed so we could not meet the group on time. I was in constant communication (although spotty because of my wifi) and these guys did everything they could to make this happen they tried to come meet us later but I my communication was delayed so we missed them. We so wanted to meet them especially because of their heroic efforts to make this work. They offered to reschedule but when they heard we were there for one day only they made a special accommodation to refund us. These are the kind of people that make traveling special. I will always recommend We Bike Amsterdam and next time we have the opportunity to get to back we will schedule a day with them.Thanks We Bike Amsterdam!!!!"

Then you add trolley's,buses and a lot of walkers to the mix and it is a totally different experience than your normal bike ride.It was one of the highlights of our stay in Amsterdam and we would recommend it, if you are comfortable on a bike."

We did stop more than expected, but it makes sense to do so in order for the guide to provide insight as it would be difficult to ride and talk/listen as the same time. You do ride a good amount on streets and cross some busy streets, so would just recommend you are comfortable riding a bike. I went with my two kids 8 and 11. My 11 year old did just fine, but he does like to ride bikes. If you are a helicopter parent you probably would be too stressed out to enjoy this tour. My 8 year old is not mature enough to ride on his own so originally was going to ride tandem but he was too short for it, so ended up with a child seat, which he was too big for and threw off the balance of the bike, but I just went ahead as I'm pretty comfortable with bikes. Point being I would just ensure your have the right bike set up if you have a child above 5 or so, but they aren't able to ride on their own. If you are an avid biker looking for a good long ride, probably should do a private tour or look for something outside the city."

He's a low-key, friendly, knowledgeable man, and we very much enjoyed our bike tour. Please note that Amsterdam is bike crazy and there are many pedestrians, to boot. There is more need in terms of looking out for onesself than most will be used to. Be well rested and have some experience walking in Amsterdam before you take on the bike tour, just for safety sake, because bikes come and go in both directions on both sides of the street. It takes some serious getting used to. Look three times before stepping out."

We saw the original West Indies Trading office, the Begijnhof (secret garden), Vondelpark and a few other sites, crossing off lots of the lesser known sites in Amsterdam. We stopped for a short respite where you could order lunch if you wanted to. Our tour lasted about 3.5 hours.

The tour route was well designed and took us through various parts of the city, mainly in the west and south.

I was impressed that he learned everyone's name in the first few minutes.

There are so many people on bikes in Amsterdam, it was hard not to start following the wrong person, or get stuck waiting behind a car. About half of our group got lost, as we were caught behind a delivery truck, and guessed at turning the wrong direction. Once we returned to the point at which we made the wrong turn, Julia easily found us. On other bike tours I have done, we wore reflective vests so we could easily stay together (and it was less of a challenge, anyway, in cities with wider roads and less bike traffic). I wonder if having participants or the guides wearing something like this would make keeping the tour together easier?Getting lost for a short period of time did not take away from our experience, however, and we would gladly go on this tour again! Thank you, Julia and We Bike Amsterdam, for an interesting orientation of the city's common, and not so common, sights!"

For 25 euros we got a 3 hour fun, informative tour of the less well known jewels of Amsterdam. Our guide Thijs made sure we were safe but treated as adults and went at a pace that suited all abilities. There was a chance to stop and talk as well as just enjoy the ride. Highly recommended!"

We were in Amsterdam for a few days and booked the 3 hour City tour as we love cycling and as the tour promised to show us the unknown City sights. Our guide Jasper was at the meeting point on time and was very friendly. We walked for about 5 minutes to collect our bikes and after Jasper explained the basics of cycling in Amsterdam, we set off. Jasper kept the pace just right and showed us areas that we would not have visited otherwise. This is a great way to see the city, to meet fellow travellers and to cover a large area in a short time. On the tour, we stopped at various places and Jasper was very informative with lots of local knowledge and some myth. I would definitely recommend this tour."

A trike is a little harder to maneuver than a cycle and can feel heavy for me especially on a hill.We can thoroughly recommend doing this tour either in a group or as we did it.

We did this on the second day of our trip and the kids said this was the very best tour we did while in the city. Thijs was patient, funny and a lot of fun. He also paid attention to the safety of our group and made sure it was a comfortable trip for all of us. We especially liked the break at the Amsterdam \"diner\" style cafe. I encourage anyone who is looking to do a bike tour to use this company. Very professional and responsive. Fantastic customer focus and great bikes!"

The bikes are solidly built, easy to ride and stable on the roads.Jasper is knowledgeable about the city, but best of all wasn't him reeling out facts but adding humour and anecdotes to the tour. It really was memorable.The highlight was either cycling through The Rijksmuseum or a trip into a 'not Church'.The guys who run the company are great and so are their tours. I'd definitely recommend."

Riding a bike is the essence of Amsterdam and by going on a small group tour it gives you a true local feel. We had Thijs as our guide and he was great. The bikes are of the highest quality and we got the true local experience. Thijs has found the right mix of information, beautiful sites and getting the biking experience. He kept us together, made sure we made it through the the intersections and took well timed breaks. Thijs cares about his clients and their experience. While our tour was staring he got a call about taking an American celebrity on tour. As a testament to his character he did not change our plans but welcomed that person to join us. He ended up giving a private tour after us so we missed our 60 seconds of fame but it speaks to his character.This was not a physically challenging ride and we saw a lot on the tour. We would strongly recommend. You can't go to Amsterdam and not try riding a bike around the city."

He knew his facts, and made the tour fun. He makes sure nobody gets lost, yet allows you to freely bike at your own pace. This equilibrium of freedom and concern allows you to cycle like you're a local, and not on a tour with an eye up your backside. Bike - I thought it would be hard. Jasper assured us it would be easy, and guess what? It was. He adjusts your bike to your needs. My girlfriend said it was too tall for her mere 5'1.5 stature, so he gave her one of the 'low-rider' bikes. (This made her look a little like the Undertaker when he was an American Bad*ss. )I really liked the tour. you stop off for some Tea and one point - which I happily replaced for a Vodka Soda. Yes - drink cycling is more fun. I can see why these guys are number 1 - definitely do this tour. ps. They give you \"after-care\" emails about where to go and what to do. They do this as friends, and they don't need to. Nor do I believe that they are influenced by any particular company/friends - they just tell you the best things to do. I liked that touch."

This is a must-do activity in Amsterdam!We did the tour as a family with 3 children, the youngest 10 years, who rate this as the \"best thing we did in Amsterdam...\". It takes you at a leisurely pace through parts of the City that you are unlikely to discover yourself and offers a fun and insightful aspect on history and culture.Our tour guide was Thijs who was fabulous and really ensured that the younger children on the tour were safe and got a great hot chocolate to warm cold hands half way through!. Thijs clearly knows and loves his City and this gave a tour that I suspect is much more personal and insightful than many of the others (though we didn't do them). The only dampener for us was the fact that I stupidly lost my wallet during the tour - Thijs could not have been more helpful in trying to find it - from cycling back around the route, calling lost and found and even offering to lend us some money! - he really went the extra mile to help and is a top man!Make sure you do this tour (just keep your wallet safe).

We chose to do a private tour and we were not disappointed! E-mails beforehand to organise the tour were responded to quickly and efficiently and Thijs met us at the bike shop at the agreed time (we were actually running a bit late). The bikes given to us all worked well and had hand brakes and 3 gears as opposed to the traditional Dutch bike with foot brakes and only one gear - we found this very helpful! We spent about 3 hours riding the streets of Amsterdam and visited a hidden church, a hidden courtyard, the headquarters of the Dutch West Indian company amongst many other sites. We also stopped for a cup of coffee and some apple tart about halfway through the tour. Overall, a very entertaining and informative tour. Thank you, Thijs."

We met on Saturday morning at Dam Square and Jasper our Guide was there before had to meet and greet us. The shop is a short walk away and we started the tour from there. Jasper was very informative, comfortable and accommodating. The history and sites we stopped at were beautiful. We had a great small group of people (5 total) and our pace was perfect for everyone on the tour. We also stopped at a small bistro for coffee and cakes and chatted as a group with Jasper. I would recommend this small start up company above a big large tour company (and we saw a lot of them with 30 or more bikes riding around) as our time was informal, and high quality. "

Although the early morning start was a bit of an ask (and only 3 out of the 4 of us managed it!) the tour guide (Tice) was terrific. He was well informed and very passionate about his city. Also, very patient with those of us less used to riding bikes. The tour takes you through parts of Amsterdam less likely to be on the tourist route. Thus, you get to find out lots of interesting facts about its history and see some more unusual but very interesting parts of the city. This is a great way to get to know the real Amsterdam. Highly recommend this tour."

Having a guide helps a lot with the first visit. The normal tour was occupied so we decided on a private tour. You just follow the guide, he shows you 'hidden' places, with nice background stories and you just follow, soak in the beauty of the city and the atmosphere. Having a coffee break to warm up, he chooses a very cozy place, which we enjoyed a lot. Overall the tour of around 3 hours went by far too quick. A reason to come back. 'we bike Amsterdam' is a bit more pricy compare to others. Just pay attention how long the tour takes place and what the maximum of participants are. This can make a big difference. Now you may ask when I am so satisfied why do you give only 4 stars. I thought about it for a while and being fair to my other reviews (including bike tours). We Bike Amsterdam is fairly a new company which has a great success - look their placement at Tripadvisor. But I think they is more potential - I mean in different options, tours, etc. I wish them all the best, keep your passion for the city and your wonderful way how you talk to your clients including teenagers."

It is believed that there are more bikes in Amsterdam than there are people. There's a more likelihood of being driven over by a bike than a car, as was the case with me. Given the culture of biking in Amsterdam, it makes sense to do a bike tour. It is a fun way to experience Amsterdam under the guidance of a local and to also meet fellow travelers. For the most part, my bike tour was pleasant, except for part of the historical element of the trip. But I suppose it is to be expected on a bike tour that the historical accounts will unlikely match those by a historian or narrator, who would be able to give a clarified historical account of Amsterdam in a clear manner e.g. The account for merchants homes in Amsterdam leaning forward vs the houses in Amsterdam that are also tilted, or leaning. There are distinguishable accounts for such. In simple terms, worthwhile trip, enjoyable and worth doing. However, if you a historian and perhaps looking to gain a more insightful historical account of Amsterdam, I would add other tours as their historical accounts of Amsterdam is very simplistic."

You already know all about the tourist hot-spots, this tour skips all of them and shows you what Amsterdam really has to offer. You'll get a real feel for the important historical significance of Amsterdam-as you'll see the home of THE WEST INDIES TRADING COMPANY (the organization that supplied African slaves to the Americas), or learn why almost all the houses in Amsterdam are tall but narrow-we even learned the origin of \"Yankee\", and why many areas of New York city are named after places in the Netherlands. Have you ever wondered why prostitution is legal?or why smoking marijuana is permitted in Amsterdam? It all has something to do with\"Dutch tolerance\" as we were educated on. Or perhaps you'd like to see the oldest building in Amsterdam(trust me you won't easily find it on your own.)Our tour guide was Thije (Tice) who wasn't just helpful, and knowledgeable but humorous. (Anecdote-when we stopped for a break about half way at a lovely outdoor cafe, the city street cleaning crew decided that was the exact moment that they had to vigorously clean THAT EXACT section of the street, spraying up dust and dirt to the point that we had to cover our drinks and after multiple apologies Thije just rolled with it joking \"Well the city of Amsterdam just wants to make sure you're riding on the cleanest street in the city\"Thije was not only friendly, but I feel as if we now we really are friends. While riding through one of the most beautiful parks I have ever seen, I was jokingly trying to ride with no hands, he saw this and put out his hand for me to hold for help and the rest of tour joked that \"We had that moment back there, we're like best friends.\"  The bikes were so easy to ride that I'm trying to find one in the States to purchase. Full disclosure: you will pass by some landmarks tourists prefer-this tour isn't about stopping to see them. So you'll have to stop by them on your own time. After the tour was over we asked Thije for someplace good to eat- again he didn't disappoint as we had an amazing meal that wasn't expensive. So we got to eat like a local does too. "

It was cool because he focused on the \"low lights\" of Amsterdam, that is the parts of Amsterdam that are less well known to tourists. He was friendly, flexible, funny, and full of facts. He also gave good directions as biking in Amsterdam is not for the faint of heart. We highly recommend this company if you want to see Amsterdam and exercise at the same time!"

Thijs, our awesome guide, was very professional gave us lots of interesting information, history etc. Pace was a bit slow for me (an active cyclist) but only because we had a large group; so no real compliant there. We got to see a number of out of the way things, more of the real Amsterdam. Price for the time, thought put into the tour and what we saw was ridiculously good. Loved the pit stop at a lovely cafe in a quiet residential neighborhood. Thijs also gave us a fabulous recommendation for a meal afterward. To sum up good bang for your buck! Go with We Bike Amsterdam if you want a great bike tour that's more than just the tourist traps."

There seemed to be a lot of Bike tour options to choose from once in Amsterdam but luckily we found this one on Tripadvisor because it had that real small business feel to it - not like some of the other larger tour companies: very down-to-earth, genuinely interested guys. The bikes were very user-friendly compared to other ones I saw being used in other tours; although still authentic looking they had good gears, brakes and locks and were easy to handle even for novices like me."

Thijs was our guide, and he was a consummate professional. He was friendly and knowledgeable, which made for a pleasant few hours. He was also attentive: we had a group of ten people on this ride, and Thijs did a great job of keeping us all together and safe... no easy task, with ten tourists from a variety of different countries, all navigating the busy streets and bridges.I'd recommend taking this bike tour at the very start of your visit to Amsterdam, because it's a great way to get your bearings... plus, Thijs provides a lot of historical perspective. It will definitely enrich your trip. After the tour, Thijs sent us a nice email with his personal suggestions for restaurants and bars, and his choices were spot-on.My wife and I cannot say enough about this experience. It was a definite highlight of our trip."

Stopped in a cafe (not a coffee shop! - if you don't know the difference, Jasper will educate you!). He gave us restaurant recommendations for later in our trip.

Highlights were the \"secret\" church, and the Begijnhof (a hidden city behind an inconspicuous door that is so detached from the urban bustle around it). We also had a nice stop at a coffee shop. Wondelpark was also a highlight of the tour, as was biking through the Rijksmuseum (the one major attraction along the route).

We biked about 250 miles in 6 days, stopped at small towns every day for a coffee or beer break and lunch. We met the barge around 3 or 4 pm. Had time to shower and refresh and then dinner around 6 pm. If you have never experienced a bike and barge go for it while you are still healthy, you will not regret it.

I liked that the tour started at 10am, a little earlier than some of the others I was looking at. The small size is also really nice.

Jasper was lovely, patient, and full of funny anecdotes. We stopped midway through the tour for a coffee, and he gave us several restaurant and bar recommendations. I truly feel like had we not done this tour we wouldn't have accomplished half of what we wanted to do.

The group stops at each landmark to let you enjoy the location. The bike was light and no trouble riding at all, tour is done in a pace that despite the duration to be 3 hours is still enjoyable and convenient to all members of the group.

To say that I am a rusty cyclist would be an understatement. Seriously, I'm an awful cyclist. However, despite my limited biking skills I had a great time zipping through the Amsterdam streets on this tour! Thijs is an excellent tour guide and provided great tips for less experienced cyclists (like myself) to feel more confident on our bikes. I couldn't imagine getting a better look at Amsterdam on a different tour. Even the boat tour we went on wasn't as informative and fun as the We Bike Amsterdam tour! So here is why I think this tour was so awesome:1. Thijs Thijs is an excellent tour guide. He's very friendly and personable, and knows quite a bit about the history of Amsterdam. He gave great insight on the history- good and bad- of Amsterdam and how it connects to the current culture. Thijs kept a medium level speed on the bike that kept our group together without anyone falling far behind. Also, he was great about explaining beforehand when we would be going into heavier traffic areas, so we would know to be more aware. Thijs never made me feel judged for my wobbly skills, and by the end of the tour I felt much more confident in my abilities to not run someone over! 2. Comfy bikes!I'm short. Comfortable bikes don't normally exist for people like me. When we arrived, I was pretty certain that I would have to use a children's bike (I'm thirty years old) because I am about a foot shorter than the average, tree-like Dutch person. To my surprise, I was able to fit on an adult bike... at the lowest setting... but still. Hooray! The bikes were in great condition.The seats were comfortable for most of the ride. I started to feel a little discomfort at the very end of the tour, but after three hours of biking, that's to be expected. The breaks and bell worked well. I had no problem switching gears when going up bridges, etc. I didn't even need to roll up my pant leg to avoid tearing my jeans. If I could've bought the bike and taken it home with me, I would have!The route:We spent quite a bit of time in the Jordaan neighborhood, which I loved it. It's full of cute shops, restaurants, cafes, you name it. We stopped at a few 'hidden' sites that most tourists wouldn't know to visit. My favorite was a huge park (can't remember the name) with a lagoon inside. It was absolutely gorgeous and was my favorite part of the whole tour. In addition to a few hidden gems, we rode past staples like the Rijk and Van Gogh museum, etc. Our group mates:In our small group we had people from the USA, England, Ireland, and Canada. It was great to get to chat with each other and learn more about our different cultures. Summary:This tour is so much fun. Riding around the streets gives you a perspective of Amsterdam, that you might not otherwise get. The small group size is perfect for asking questions and really getting to know your group mates. Also, the length of the tour may seem long at first, but it flies by in no time. If you are not the world's best cyclist, don't worry. This tour is fun for people of all biking ability levels, even terrible cyclists like me!"

The tour took in a big chunk of the city and there's nothing quite like being on a bike in Amsterdam to feel inducted into the city. We covered the main attractions as well as some locations a bit further off the beaten track and the guide was great and providing information and context to the things that we saw.I was pleasantly surprised by stops we took where we actually parked the bikes to go an explore some points nearby on foot which was nice. There was also a break in the middle for a drink and plenty of time for taking photographs along the way (I wish I had taken my camera in hindsight).The pace of cycling was gentle and the guide seemed to try and avoid the busy highways were possible to make the ride as least stressful as possible! The bikes had mountain-bike tyres rather than road bike which I preferred and they were solid and seemed to be well maintained. I'm short (5'1\") and ended up on a child's bicycle but it was pretty plain and you couldn't tell the difference between mine and the other bicycles. The bicycles were also pretty plainly decorated which I preferred compared to some of the other cycling tours which had brightly coloured bicycles which screamed 'tourist'.Would definitely recommend this tour to anyone visiting Amsterdam."

Our bike tour was on August 17 and even though it was a cloudy and rainy morning, it didn't take away from the lovely 3-hour tour. Our group was small and because it was a Sunday morning, bike traffic (which can be very scary in Amsterdam) was very light. Jasper was very friendly and knowledgeable about the history of Amsterdam and I learned a lot. The spots he took us to I wouldn't have been able to find on my own (nor would I have even known they existed). Riding was done at a reasonable pace and the bikes were in good shape and comfortable. There were 2 young kids in our group and they were able to keep up with everyone just fine. I would highly recommend this tour to everyone."

It was so easy to book. Sent an email and had a response back within minutes then tour was arranged. Meeting in Dam square was easy, then short walk to collect bikes. I rode a bike with a cart on the front which my 6 year old rode in. It was easy to ride and I managed the 12k no problem as it was spread over 3 hours with regular stops to look at interesting landmarks and hear fascinating history. We all thoroughly enjoyed the tour and our guide was great. He made the tour fun and informational. We even found a few cats for my son! Many thanks for a lovely time.

I was also afraid that my legs and butt would be sore for 2-3 days afterwards, but the terrain was so flat and the tour was so leisurely that I was not sore at all! We were able to see so much of Amsterdam in the 3 hours and learned so many things that we otherwise would have never known about the city and its culture. The tour guide (Jasper) was so friendly and willing to answer any and all questions we had. We stuck around afterwards for a map of the city, and he was able to give us some great recommendations for restaurants and attractions. This tour is a must-do!"

We didn't want the historical tour, since we have been to Amsterdam before. We wanted to see and experience the \"real\" Holland. As much as we could in a few hours, anyway. :-)We booked a private tour at the last minute. Thijs met us at our hotel with the bikes right on time, and we were off!From the hotel, a short ride to the ferry, across the lake. 2 minutes later we were out of the city, riding through some of the old villages along the dikes. Plenty of time to take pictures and even stop for an adult refreshment!From there, we rode along the dikes, seeing the swans and ducks, just admiring the countryside.We then turned inland, and headed to a small town with maybe 100 people where we had (a tasty!) lunch and a beverage.Then, across a canal with another ferry (very tiny ferry) into a pasture, riding among the cows, crossing the special bridges over the small canals. All this time Thijs was taking pictures for us, checking to see if we were too tired, taking care of us.From there, we headed through several other small picturesque villages and back into Amsterdam. We took the long way, and as a result, we got to see an antique windmill! I think we rode about 5 hours, maybe 35k. A nice pace, not too fast, not too slow. The ride is mostly flat (it is Holland, after all), with a few small hills. You don't have to ride as far as we did, we were just having a great time, so we wanted to keep going. Thijs was very accommodating in this respect. He was having fun, too!Afterwards, sharing a beer and photos with Thijs and Jasper, a great close to the ride with very nice people, on a beautiful sunny day in Holland!"

I highly recommend it to anyone whether you have spent some time in Amsterdam before or not.The ride is very easy and not lengthy by any standards.

Perfect weather and a calm city didn't make the experience any worse, quite contrary. For anyone new to the city, or and experienced visitor that want to see Amsterdam in a new way, this is an excellent way to spend some time. I can really recommend a tour with We bike Amsterdam."

It's a great way to take in a lot of the city in one go and useful for getting your bearings for the rest of your stay.Luckily for us, my partner and I were the only two people booked on that particular day, so we had our guide, Jasper, all to ourselves. (They have a policy to do the tour no matter how few people are there - excellent for customer service.)The mix of cycling along just looking at the buildings, plus some background history, plus some stops at specific points of interest was a good one. We went to places we'd never have gone to under our own steam. I'd have actually liked even more information along the way as it was so interesting. The great advantage though is we could ask Jasper other questions as they arose, so we learnt extra stuff. Plus the bikes were good quality (better than some I saw ridden around by people on other tours). It's a bit more expensive than similar tours, but I can't compare what they're like.Tip: We went on a Monday and Jasper said it's usually quieter then, so it made getting around a lot easier and safer."

I really recommend it, specially if your stay in Amsterdam is short ( this way you can see a lot in 3 h)"

We enjoyed this so much (including 2 teenage kids who are hard to please) that we came back a couple of days later and went on a tour out in to the countryside with Thijs and Jasper. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend either of these trips, or better still both.Thanks again Thijs and Jasper for showing us Amsterdam."

I have been to Amsterdam many times in the past but Jasper managed to show us many new places I had never seen before. The two older kids had their own bikes and we were a bit nervous about letting them loose on the narrow roads but Jasper managed it really well and kept them under close supervision. The youngest went in the front of a cargo bike I rode. It was a bit hard work at times as the road gets a bit steep over some of the bridges but our youngest loved it as he thought he was in a Star Wars movie. I didn't mind riding this bike as I ride most days anyway but if you are not the fittest then Jasper was more than happy to ride this bike for us. Jasper was great, very knowledgeable and amazingly enthusiastic about his home. It was a great pleasure to spend the morning with him and highly recommended."

He was very much excited to show us around and knew his stuff, which is great because there is so much history in the city. Plus, biking around is the best way to see city. It isn't too large, and biking around really allows you to see a lot of cool side streets and attractions you wouldn't otherwise fine (and of course the tour brings you to these places).I highly recommend this for anyone traveling through Amsterdam on short or long stays."

Phillip was very knowledgeable and willing to answer any and all questions we had. In the middle of the tour, his chain broke on his bike, so I ended up riding on the back of my bike while he cycled like a true Amsterdammer! The tour takes you through the Jordaan, to see a Dutch resistance church, through Vondelpark, and to various other hidden gems. We had a ton of different stops, so if you're worried about being on a bike for 3-4 hours straight, don't be. My only issue with the tour had nothing to do with the company, but with the other tourists who joined us. We had to wait twice for the same group, who got lost in Vondelpark and then insisted on stopping at their hotel to grab rain jackets. I'd recommend maybe running two separate tours for those who are used to cycling and able to keep up with a group and maybe another tour for beginners/those who want to go slower. It was rather frustrating to wait for this group at every single intersection."

He is a local bloke and his passion and love for this beautiful city really shine through.The meeting point is right in Dam Square, where we met Thijs and walked 5 mins to the bike location. The bikes were all excellently maintained, clean and easy to ride ( and comfortable saddles).  The tour meanders through undiscovered little treasures off the usual tourist trail. But Thijs takes the time to tell you all about the history behind the sight in front of you. You really get an in depth understanding of how Amsterdam became the place it is now. If you are lucky enough to do the tour on a Saturday, Thijs will also take you to a wonderful local market where the locals shop. At the end of the trip, Thijs also sent an email listing his favourite places (that are local haunts, rather than tourist traps) including a local microbrewery and gave his contact details for any follow up questions. He couldn't be helpful enough!I would say that the pace of this trip would suit anyone of any age as long as they have a degree of bike and road awareness. There were no steep climbs and the pace was set by the mix of the group. Half way through, the group stopped at a little corner cafe where beers, coffee and juice were readily available at a reasonable price. Thijs and his co-owner, Jasper have up relatively recently set up 'We Bike Amsterdam' so I can only 100% wholeheartedly recommend that you support local independent business such as this."

We were met by Thijs in Dam Square for our 3 hour bike tour in Amsterdam.Thijs is passionate about his city and very informative. We were the only 2 on the tour the day we went- so it was like a private tour for the 2 of us. Thijs has a wonderful personality and explained all the sites in detail. He took us to many places we never would have found on our own. The bikes are easy to ride and you will get the hang of it very quickly as you go through all the different neighborhoods in Amsterdam.He responds very quickly to emails to confirm our tour.If you have one activity in Amsterdam to do- then this is the PERFECT tour! We asked him about the culture, daily life etc and he was happy to answer all our questions. The bike tour was one of the highlights of our 2 week trip through Europe! We will remember this wonderful day for the rest of our lives! Thank you Thijs for making it such a special day!"

We were very lucky that we booked the group tour on a day no one else had booked. But they still ran the tour and we got our own private tour. Really friendly and knowledgeable guide. We learnt so much about the area that you would not get on your run of the mill tour. Half way through we stopped at a cute little cafe and we sat and had a drink and a chat. Very relaxed but hugely enjoyable and educational tour. Highly recommend!"

Thijs took us to places that you wouldn't normally get to visit on a tour and he shared lots of interesting facts about the city. After exploring the city on foot the rest of the week, we saw how much of the city we had really toured on this excursion. It was a lot! From the canals to the Museum District to Vondelpark. (We didn't see parrots on the tour, but we knew to look for them because of it). Our guide was friendly and we had fun talking with him. He even gave us advice on where to bike outside of the city since we were going to be in Amsterdam for a whole week."

Jasper made us feel at ease, was very laid back and didn't rush us at all. He said as it was just us 2 if we wanted to see anything in particular he would cater it more to suit us which was great! The tour was about 3 1/2 hours and we stopped for a coffee too where Jasper chatted to us and marked out sites good spots to eat/drink on our map which was brilliant. He was very attentive in the tour always checking on us and giving us plastic ponchos to wear when the rain got worse. As it was a bank holiday there he even went to the effort to get keys to the hidden church to show us around. Nothing seemed any bother to Jasper and it felt more like being shown seeing by a friend. If we hadn't done this tour we would have missed out on so many interesting facts and stories as well as having our many questions answered. Definitely worth it and would highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Amsterdam."

Maybe having everyone introduce themselves to the whole group would even enhance the experience! Jasper took his time and was so patient especially when crossing the streets! Other bikers and drivers are crazy! We stopped for a coffe break to enjoy the amsterdam canals. It was a beautiful day with a very informative, friendly and relaxing guide, Jasper. It completely exceeded my expectations. We went to all the main sights in amsterdam. Although i wish we spent more time in Vondelpark. The whole tour was about 3.5 hours. I thought it was suppose to be 2. I didnt mind its length but maybe a note of that would be helpful to others. Take this tour with Jasper and his partner! Totally worth it!"

Thijs was even so awesome to send my girlfriend and I an email of all the amazing places you can eat and drink at. Completely going out of his way to do this for us totally gives him a bonus point or two. I can't recommend enough! Cost was about 25euro per person and bike rental is included in that price.

Our afternoon on bikes, veering through canals, hitting major sites, learning about the less 'touristy' places and avoiding cars and pedestrians was by far our best day spent in Amsterdam. Thijs made our tour very personal, also taking us to his favorite places to eat (we had asked for a food focused tour), and adding a very intimate point of view of his city. He made a point to show us the less traveled roads and the sights that might not be outlined in a guidebook, like the secret churchs of Amsterdam. He was a very knowledgeable tour guide, lending insight to all aspects of Amsterdam life; economy, politics, art, religion, & CUISINE! He gave us a new lens through which we could experience and appreciate Amsterdam like a local and also as a tourist. I would recommend the tour to anyone and everyone!

Amsterdam is a great city to walk around but by bike you see so much more and after our 3 hour tour (which included much welcomed stop with fab apple pie!)

He also surprised us by sharing a lot of knowledge about the birds of the area. I would never have found (nor tried to find) the small courtyards and alleys he took us through. I was only in Amsterdam for one full day and I am glad this is how I spent the morning. Even for a longer trip this would make the perfect start. I also appreciated Thij's recommendations for restaurants and bars from his follow up email. It was too bad my stay was so short so I couldn't try them all!I also appreciated that Thijs was able to adapt the tour to the interests of those participating. I imagine other groups still see the same sights, but with emphases on different parts of the tour.

However, I'll do my best, but it's hard to describe a tour that is as friendly and informational as this. I was able to see the best spots of Amsterdam and see and learn things that I would never have seen on a different tour. The small tour group makes the tour less rehearsed as you get to know your tour guide and learn all kinds of neat and interesting things. To sum up: if you want to really know about Amsterdam and have a great time learning about it, then take this tour!I can't wait to go back!"

He helped us feel comfortable on the bike and confident about navigating the city. He showed us hidden treasures we had not read about in a guide book and answered our questions about the city and its history. He was extremely patient when we stopped to take photos and very generous with his time. Bring a hat and gloves and dress in layers for this time of year. We were lucky it did not rain. The tour is a great value. Our only regret is that we didn't tip more generously."

In town for business so had limited time to see the city and this was ideal. The guide, Jasper, was very personable and knowledgable about Amsterdam. We started at 10am and ended a little over 3 hours later. Biked around the city and through the beautiful park--lots of photo opportunities. Even took a short coffee/hot chocolate break and sat outside to enjoy the morning sun. If you have time to do only one thing in Amsterdam, this is it!"

He was very knowledgable and very passionate about his country. This was a fantastic way to get some Dutch history while doing something extremely fun. Amsterdam is a beautiful city, and I can't think of a better way to see it. Definitely bring a camera. There are so many wonderful photo opportunities. We hit all of our must see's as well as many other's we didn't even know about. While saying goodbye, Jasper sent us with many recommendations of local highlights, including Broodje Bert Lunchcorner which had the most amazing sandwiches with great prices. I would most definitely recommend this as a top priority!!!"

Jasper was our tour guide and since no one else signed up for the tour that day, we essentially had a private bike tour of Amsterdam. The bikes were in good condition and very comfortable to ride. The trip was well paced and Jasper was full of interesting tidbits about the city. We stopped at a cafe in the middle of the tour and he also gave us excellent recommendations for cafes and restaurants around the city. Since we are from New York, we stopped by a place which had historical connections to Dutch colonies in New York and learned more about the history between New York and Dutch colonialism. We had a fantastic experience and would highly recommend it."

As well as getting an idea of the layout of the city and where all the main highlights are located (Museumplein, Anne Frank House, Vondelpark etc.) this was a great way to see the less touristy side of the city (e.g. pretty little canals, local neighbourhood cafes). The bikes were brand-spanking new and lovely to ride, and the pace of the ride was very leisurely - perfect for a crisp but sunny winter's morning! Most importantly, Thijs was an excellent guide - very professional, friendly and prepared for any situation (even giving me a ride on the back of his bike for the last 15mins when I got a puncture!) I would definitely take the tour again if I'm in Amsterdam just for the great company!"

The tour was done at a leisurely pace, always checking if we were OK and allowing us to ask questions about the places we visited.

Riding a bike in Amsterdam was one of the top things I wanted to do, but I wasn\u2019t confident to do it by myself. The communication by email was great and they were very accommodating. I thought that we would be given more of the \u201clocal\u201d knowledge stated in the advertising, however, if there was then we would have had to stop more, so in retrospect I think there was probably a good balance of a good ride around the town and some good chats along the way.When you turn up at the meeting point there is a bit of a walk to the shop to pick up the bikes.We stopped half way in the tour at a cafe for a coffee; this incidentally was the best coffee I had in my trip!The tour compliments the walking tour (different company) very well. The walking tour takes you around the centre of the town and the bike tour takes you around the town. So there was very little overlap of information.One of the highlights is riding through the building built by Napoleon, I think it\u2019s a museum now, shows how much attention I was paying, but I was having too much fun on my bike.If I had more time I would have gone to hire a bike myself again afterwards, I felt like it gave me the confidence to do it myself.I would definitely recommend this activity to anyone who is keen on riding a bike in Amsterdam for a true Amsterdam experience."

After collecting the other 2 couples we had to take a short 5 minute walk to the bike hire shop. 'We Bike Amsterdam' don't own the bikes themselves as they are hired through a 3rd party, this means if you enjoyed the cycling they will happily let you rent the bikes beyond the scope of the tour.The bikes are 3 gear Dutch bikes and were very easy to ride. They were quite heavy but this made them feel very stable on the winding Amsterdam cycle lanes. They also had some really comfy saddles.Our tour with Thijs lasted just over 3 hours and allowed us to experience some of the more elusive attractions Amsterdam has to offer. Also, cycling is the most popular form of transport in Amsterdam and we felt we might miss out if we didn't partake in it.Luckily, our tour was on a Saturday which meant a special stop at the famous Noordemarkt to sample some organic food and see the flea market. This is well worth a visit even if it isn't part of your tour.Overall this was a great beginning to our weekend break in Amsterdam. It helped us get accustomed to the culture and general layout of the city.Thijs also sent an email after the tour with some restaurant recommendations and other attractions. This really added the personal touch which would be lacking with a larger tour company.We would recommend this tour to friends, family and strangers on Trip Advisor :-)"

I originally booked this tour as one of the other bigger companies wasn't running during January - what a happy accident!We met Thijs and walked a short way to pick up our very good, easy to ride rental bikes (included in the price) and set off - the tour keeps a great pace with lots of little stops which helped us to get used to the bikes, as well as learn some fascinating information about Amsterdam. We felt like locals riding around and Thijs gave us access to some secret spots which are really memorable. Some cyclists in Amsterdam do go fairly quickly but they are quite used to slower paced tourists and you soon get used to crossing the canals and waiting for a gap to cross if it's busy - felt safer on a bike than as a pedestrian! The cafe half way round had amazing hot chocolate too.When we got back Thijs offered to send an email with a few other tips for markets, cafes and restaurants which all turned out to be great.Best tour I've ever done, we're still talking about it!"

Despite booking as part of a group tour, we were alone as no one else had booked on this Wintery day. Thijs, our tour guide made us feel safe and very confident in and amongst the ofttimes chaotic Amsterdam traffic. Thijs was also incredibly knowledgeable about the city and took us through the parts of Amsterdam often sadly ignored due to the fame (or infamy) of the Red Light District. The aim of the tour is to experience Amsterdam from the point of view of a local and we did exactly that - touring through beautiful hidden churches and quiet courtyards otherwise inaccessible to the public. This tour also hits the big spots like the museum district as well, so nothing is left off the menu. We stopped for a coffee in a small cafe bar for a break midway through and chatted with Thijs, who proved to be fantastic company throughout the tour, not only knowledgable but funny and enthusiastic too. After the great tour Thijs followed up with an email to remind us of restaurants he'd recommended in Amsterdam so we did not forget.Can not speak highly enough of this tour. Fun, young guides who love the city and you get to see parts otherwise left off the tourist radar."

Price was so reasonable, they should charge more! (Shhhhh, don't tell them, just tip high). Price includes bike rental and the bikes are of good quality and service. Jasper's tour was fun and friendly. Often times the tour became comical because his friendly nature allowed everyone (other tourists) to interact with each other freely. We (family of four adults) loved the way the tour took us to the hidden parts of Amsterdam and to a nice cafe for a rest and refreshment along the way. The frequent stops along the way were always complemented by an excellent historical story or fact. Only complaint would be with regards to the the unfortunate typical tourist road, bike and pedestrian traffic that made it at times difficult to stay together as a group. Recommend tours be done outside of peak times. Jasper's patience and flexibility was greatly appreciated by all, we were not at all accustomed to the traffic rules and occasional local unfriendly (vocal) attitude toward tourists on bike by the hurried locals. These people need to relax and not verbally attack the tourists."

Thijs was friendly, knowledgeable and a really fun host, and he led us along beautiful paths to lovely hidden parts of Amsterdam I would never have otherwise seen. If you have not been to Amsterdam before you may not realise that Amsterdammers mostly cycle which means the bike paths are excellent and safe (compared to other countries), and as everything is flat, this is not a hugely strenuous tour even for people unaccustomed to cycling. Having said that, Thijs was super vigilant and took particular care getting us through traffic safely. He was also full of interesting detail which I'm sure changed the way I think about the city of Amsterdam, and we left with lots of great recommendations for things to do, see and eat the next few days.I would highly recommend this to any of my friends coming to Amsterdam - even if only for a day.

We saw beautiful spots through the city, learned more than a thing or two, and ended up exceeding our tour time by at least 30 minutes because of how much talking we were doing (Thijs asked first if it was ok to finish the whole tour and we agreed that we wanted to keep going). The bikes are very comfortable, the pace felt just right, and Thijs kept a close eye to make sure we were navigating the busy streets without problem.

I'm not sure I can say much to add to the previous 'rave' reviews of this small tour operator (Seems odd to call it a company-as it only has 2 owner/guides!!). Having experienced a 'back of a Vespa' tour of local street food in Saigon recently It is clear that you get much more from a city with a local guide who knows and takes you to places away from the tourist 'hot spots'. Jasper was brilliant in this with a knowledge of someone who lives locally and knows the interesting sites and views to see. We were luck that another party had pulled out so we had his sole attention for the tour--just lucky! We had a wonderful relaxed few hours learning about the history, architecture and culture of Amsterdam visiting many off the beaten track buildings.--as well as learning the technique of cycling in Amsterdam--No1 rule--Don't stop--this creates chaos !This is an ideal introduction to the city--and for 25 euros per person extremely good value. If you are visiting Amsterdam make 'We Bike Amsterdam' your first port of call ! Then hire a bike for the rest of your stay---don't bother with the bus, tram and canal bus passes!"

Once we booked with Thijs, our guide, we were eager to pick a place that represented Amsterdam well. We decided on ZAANSE SCHANS an approx. 5-6 hour bike ride to authentic windmills. It was an easy and flat ride and we also took a ferry and boat to get to our destination. The town was so wonderful, right out of a storybook. And smelled like chocolate!!! We took a little tour and had a picnic lunch and took lots of pictures. What a fun day and the most amazing memory to take back."

The tour stops by all the major sites like the anne frank museum, jordaan etc but Thijs goes one step further and shows you many of the hidden gems in the city which you just wouldnt get with the other \"stack em high sell em cheap\" bike tours. Price for the group tour is ?25 per person and well worth every penny. If you want something special and off the beaten track, dont think twice and book.

Cycling through Amsterdam is the best way to get to know the city and the We Bike tour brings you to parts of Amsterdam you would not find by yourself. For example we visited a so called `hidden church` De Rode Hoed and got a clear explanation of the history of the church now being used as a theatre.. As a tourist one is allways distracted by the `hotspots`, the nice and best parts of a town are diificult to find. The We Bike tour brings you to these nice areas. e.g.we loved cycling through an area called the Jordaan. As we were in a small group, we had ample opportunity to put questions and interact with our guides.Thijs and Jasper. Even though the weather turned out to be real Dutch (halfway it poored with rain!) Thijs en Jasper created a pleasant atmosphere which (together with the glass of Dutch Jenever we were offered on the `Magere bridge` over the river Amstel) made us forget about the rain."

The pace was perfect with plenty of stops to hear about the city and culture of Amsterdam. I wasn't the least bit tired, and only for a short time were we riding amongst cars and heavy bike traffic. Amsterdam caters to bikers with plenty of bike paths to keep riders safe. The majority of the ride was off the city streets through beautiful Vondelpark and outlying areas of the city.

We had a WONDERFUL guide named Antwone. He was extremely personable and spoke English very well! Our group was a nice size - not too big, and Antwone did a GREAT job keeping \"watch\" over all of us to make sure we all had a safe, enjoyable, pleasant ride! He did an excellent job explaining about the history of the area and we learned a LOT and had a LOVELY afternoon! It was such a treat to leave the city behind and ride through the countryside surrounding Amsterdam and really get a feel for what life is like for people living in this area. Of course, it was also interesting to see a real windmill up close, visit a farm to hear about how cheese is made, and have the farmer show us how he makes wooden shoes! I would highly recommend this tour to anyone. You will have a very nice time and you will see and learn a LOT about this wonderful city and the area that surrounds it! It's a lovely bike ride through beautiful countryside - not too hilly or \"hard\" of a ride - with nice bikes -- and a terrific guide! PERFECT!!!!"

We were in Amsterdam for three days before departing on a Celebrity Cruise, and we wanted to experience the Netherlands on bikes. After researching several tour companies, we decided that Joy Ride Tours was the best option with the tour covering exactly what we wanted. We chose the tour that started in the city and went through the countryside to the farm where they make cheese and clogs. Our guide, Antoine, was absolutely wonderful. He was early to the meeting place, easy to find, kept track of every guest at all times so there was never a moment when anyone was separated, and he made it all incredibly fun, low pressure and informative. He is very well educated and loves history and it shows! We stopped several times to discuss various things and he always kept it maximally interesting and just the right length. He was able to handle just about every question guests came up with. I think we booked about 3 months in advance and they were fully booked already on two of our days there - so plan ahead - this tour is well worth it! Our party ranged in height from 5'2\" to 6' tall, and there were taller and shorter people within our group. Joy Ride had bikes to fit everyone. Not only that, but the bikes are also equipped with saddlebags that hold a surprising amount of items. We had two backpacks, a big camera and three larger professional lenses, and we were able to bike with nothing on our backs or tugging at our shoulders. Fantastic!! We took three bike tours while in Europe and Joy Ride was the only company that provided any adequate cargo rom on the bikes themselves.This tour was fantastic. I can't think of a single person I know who would not have enjoyed it. The company is small and independent, which gives them the flexibility to make sure every detail is cared for. They are passionate about biking in Amsterdam and it shows. Book early and enjoy!"

Antoine, our tour guide, had a wealth of knowledge, was very personable and honest, and never skipped a beat. Although they only accept no more than 14 riders per tour, ours ended up with 16 due to a booking error. However, the owners of the company were upfront about the oversight and to make up for it, they offered a free drink and Stroopwafels upon return of our tour. They also offered a return of payment to any unhappy riders. Not one person requested a refund. We think that the gesture went above and beyond expectations especially in today's world. Don't hesitate...book with this company and if you are lucky enough to get Antoine, you will surely have a 'Joy Ride'."

My father-in-law was unable to join us and Sean gave him lots of information and directions as to where to spend a few hours in the city. The bike was in excellent condition. There were stops for photos and informative information along the way. It was one of our most memorable and fun thing to do during our Europe trip. Great for family. Both of our teenage kids enjoy the ride as much as we did."

Despite that I had a wonderful time! The bikes are maintained really well, and are surprisingly comfy for a four hour bike ride. The tour my fianc\u00e9 and I did was the Windmill, Cheese and Clogs, but it was so much more. Our tour guide (I want to say Alison?) was such good fun, and was full of little anecdotes about the region, as well as the typical historical bits. We both had a fantastic time! The tour guides also gave out a restaurant guide and a map with things to see and do in Amsterdam. Well worth the money, a great day out! Also worth mentioning the ponchos they provide are specifiacly designed for bike riding, so if anyone is considering taking a coat, it is not needed"

The guide was great, Sean. He's lived all over the world and really knew his stuff. We learned a great deal and his ways of relating historical facts and concepts was quite excellent. We cycled through some really beautiful parks and along various canals on our way outside the city. The countryside quickly opened up and we were in a beautiful rural setting with fields and low dikes and polders and such. Really quite picturesque. We stopped at a working dairy, cheese-making and clog-making place (1 of only 3 places in the Netherlands that still makes clogs by hand). They had very nice painted clogs; very traditional. But, the ones that really caught my eye were hand-carved wedding clogs. Really beautiful. We were able to taste their cheeses: young, garlic, aged, and smoke. All Gouda. All delic. And, even though it was torrential down-pouring just 25 miles south of us, we weren't rained on for the entire tour.Fantastic tour. Great bikes, and super comfortable seats. Excellent tour company, and such incredibly reasonable prices!"

            "review": "A favorite day of all time!. A friend had recommended this company to me for my trip to Amsterdam. I was a woman on my own and this was a perfect half-day adventure! One of the owners, Allison, was our guide that day. I was glad I'd made a reservation online - not only did I save 3 euros but a couple that were walk-ups were unable to join us because the tour was full. You meet on foot at the I Amsterdam sign in Museumplein - at the head of the reflecting pool, just behind the Rijksmuseum. It is also close to a public toilet (50 cents) that is very modern and cool, BTW - at the Cobra Cafe (I think they open at 10am). There are also a few \"snack huts\" close by where you can buy a snack for the approximately four-hour ride (while cheese tasting was included on the Country Bike Tour, I was still glad I'd brought a bag of trail mix; there are several stops where you can eat your snack). Be sure to bring water too - you can fill up your bottle at the farm. After everyone was there, our guide walked us to their shop, located near the Hard Rock Cafe (about 1/4 mile), all the while telling us about the city and some stories about the locations we were passing. At the shop, we all got a bike, checked the seat height, and loaded up our saddle bags with essentials only. The shop will keep your bigger backpack if you don't want to wear it on the tour. Request a helmet or \"short bike\" if you need to ahead of time with the company. No one wore helmets on my tour. The terrain is so flat and the tires are good and sturdy - plus you pass very few cars (except for crossing a few intersections exiting and re-entering Amsterdam proper), mostly other bikers and walkers. The tour itself was so enjoyable - and I am not, by any means, a regular bike rider. It was easy and we didn't go very fast. It had been many months since I'd been on a bike and there were some people on the tour that hadn't ridden for years. Our group was a good mix of people from several countries, in their early 20s to 60s-70s, couples, singles, friends, etc. The bikes are the highest quality town-style bikes; very comfortable seats and very easy to change gears. There are several stops, such as at the Vondelpark, a houseboat \"neighborhood\", a cheese and clog farm, a windmill, and sometimes a few other stops along the way. I felt safe and very relaxed; it was great to get out of the city for the afternoon. Bring sunscreen and a hat if it's sunny out but know that much of the paths we followed are partially shaded by the beautiful trees. The air is so fresh and sweet, and the countryside is so close to the city. I believe our tour was a round trip of 23 kilometers that day (about 14 miles). After a shower I was ready to go to dinner that night - not too tired and full of enthusiasm from a wonderful adventure! I would absolutely recommend this to anyone comfortable riding a bike and being outside for four hours. It is a beautiful way to see the city and beyond and learn about the history and culture of Amsterdam and Holland."

The trip planned wisely so it is quite hasteless and I even haven't noticed that we traveled about 20 kilometers, we had about 5 stops while this trip. We have seen all main dutch things on this trip: houseboats, windmill, cheese farm and clogs making process, and also riding a bicycle is a very dutch way to move around :) So, I would say that if you want to get familiar with Holland in one day this trip will suits you well :)"

Allison was a terrific tour guide, leading 14 of us around and keeping us all together, while stopping at various points of interest to explain the history of Amsterdam through its parks, locks, rivers, windmills and very thoughtfully taking photos of each of us.

The bikes were in excellent shape, and Allison and her husband could adjust the height of the handlebars or seats to fit you perfectly. The saddlebags are spacious enough for all the cheese and clogs you might buy!

The tour included peaceful moments riding through the forest and we ended up back in Amsterdam to explore the food stalls at the outdoor market. The terrain is flat and the riding is easy.

Allison was constantly ensuring that the group was safe and her chatter/descriptions were quite humorous. It wasn't a difficult ride at all and there is no need to be super fit for this. Also, although there was no lunch break, my husband and I made do with a banana each which was just right when there was a break at the farm.

I am the \"anti-tour\" person normally but the reviews were so good for this company so I gave it a try. So happy I did. Allison is great and provided the perfect balance of information vs letting you sit back and enJOY the ride. A few people had a bit of trouble on their bikes (which was really strange because it is a dead easy ride) but I think it was because they were either taking selfies, not paying attention or hungover from the night before! Highly recommend the Windmills, Cheese and Clogs tour!"

I emailed ahead to request a shorter bike (I'm 5'3) and they responded very quickly and had one ready for me on the day. The bike was great, I wanted to steal it and take it home with me. Very comfortable for a 4 hour ride! It was great to get out of the city and explore some of the outskirts of Amsterdam, and much less stressful than navigating through the city! Saw some beautiful parts of the countryside, and the farm was also fun to visit. I really enjoyed the Windmill, we got some great pictures and Gelato along the way! Allison responded well to questions from the group and you can tell she has a great love for the city and loads of knowledge. Really glad we chose this tour, and thought it was great value for money! Would highly recommend to anyone who feels comfortable on a bike!"

I loved it because: The equipment is fabulous, great newer bikes, rain ponchos worked very well. No sore butt from the bike seat at all. Went to places you would never find on your own, heard history told in a great way, you can tell they love the place!Just the right mix of riding, stopping for little chats on the area/history, and photo ops!And for a few hours, I forgot that I was a tourist and pretended that I was just out for a ride in my neighbourhood! My face was sore from smiling!!! Just thinking how many people visit this beautiful city and miss riding a bike here makes me sad for them. You just need to know how to ride a bike, not well, not fast. Book it and if you are unsure, practice a bit before your trip. Thanks you Joy!!!!"

However, give one a bike and a fang-framed snarl emerges amidst expeditious follicular activity and they blitz the streets with the sole intent of auditioning for the next remake of \"rollerball\". It was with this image in my mind that, much against my better judgement and having ensured my next of kin was fully briefed, I booked the country tour with Joy Ride. Alison, who, I am happy to report, lacked any dental exaggeration or facial hair, was a vivacious and capable tour guide, although I was unreasonably perturbed by the revelation that her name wasn't \"Joy\". She bounced her informative, witty banter off our group for the first half-hour with little reaction but her resilience (probably born of her, mercifully subdued, American heritage) eventually won the day and everybody warmed to her natural exuberance and passion for her home city. Our trusty aluminium steeds boasted seven gears, good sized pannier storage and the world's most comfortable saddle... seriously, I photographed it so I could buy one for my own bike. All the cycles were relatively new; a benefit emphasised as we parked alongside another, less fortunate, tour group at least two members of which were animatedly expressing their discontent over some aspect of velocipede maintenance. The tour itself was purposeful but leisurely with rest stops at points of interest including a cheese farm, a windmill and, most poignantly an amazing ice-cream stall. Interestingly the itinerary effectively described Dutch life beyond the aberration of Amsterdam; canals, dykes, windmills, houseboats and a conservative (and apparently unforgiving) people still mad at the Germans for stealing their bicycles seventy years ago. This is a unique and fascinating experience which pairs the history and culture of the Netherlands with a mode of transportation ingrained into its heart. Joy Ride Tours appears to be the \u201cRolls-Royce\u201d of a plethora of options, and at something around 6 Euros an hour why wouldn\u2019t you do it?"

When my better half booked this I wanted to cry, especially after seeing the sheer chaos and quantity of bikes in Amsterdam that fly past each other mere centimetres apart. Dreading the worst I went along and it was the best thing I did during my weekend in Amsterdam and I cannot recommend this tour highly enough. Shaun takes you from The Museumplein through Vondelpark to the surrounding countryside, seeing a wealth of canals, dykes, houseboats and windmills along the way. You stop at a working cheese farm and clog factory where you can feast on delicious Amsterdam cheese for lunch. You take several stops where Shaun will tell you of the history of Amsterdam in such detail and enthusiasm that you cannot go away without having learnt something.The bikes are great quality and so comfortable to ride. It's completely flat and you need no prior fitness to enjoy the tour. As you're cycling in the countryside, it's not busy at all and even as a 'nervous cyclist' I found it easy, relaxing and enjoyable. Words that I would never have associated with the use of a bike before!Shaun does tours in the centre of Amsterdam, but we chose the countryside tour as it gives you a chance to see a bit of the Netherlands beyond the city."

With a chance of rain, he even offered full refunds to anyone who wanted to back out, but all 15 group members rode on (It sprinkled our last 5 minutes). From the starting point in the usy city we crossed the street into Vondelpark, passed through quiet neighborhoods, and rode along canals and poulders. It was a leisurely and enjoyable ride and Sean stopped along the way to give insightful talks. We visited a farm that makes cheese and wooden shoes, stopped at a windmill, saw row boat races in the Amstel, and viewed wildlife, including cranes and herons. This was one of the top highlights of our European trip. Be sure to reserve in advance. The Hollanders do not wear helmets, but you can reserve one in advance."

This is the first time I have done a bicycle tour anywhere and this experience touring with Allison, co-owner, with her husband Sean, has set an experience that I don't believe can be surpassed. It is as described by the other reviews. I think it is important that you are comfortable on a bike as the \"busy-ness\" of biking in Amsterdam can be intimidating. Allison did a great job of ensuring everyone's safety getting our group of 14 riders in and out of the city. I was so surprised to be in the Dutch countryside within 20 miles minutes. Once in the countryside it was like drinking a fine wine, relaxing and oh so enjoyable. I learned so much from Allison about Amsterdam's history and culture. She's an American who has fully embraced this beautiful country. It is very well priced for what you get. It was absolutely at the top of our highlights. And, if you're worried about the length, don't worry. It's a leisurely pace with frequent stops over 4+ hours. Do bring your own water and lunch, both of which can be easily obtained from food vendors on the Museumplein grounds. There is one bathroom stop at the cheese farm. And do check out the \"award-winning\" bathrooms nearby the meeting point. They are one-of-a kind and great! Thanks Allison and Sean for creating such a great touring experience.

We stopped every 20 minutes or so at all the interesting points and she described the history. She took photos with our cameras at great locations. We stopped at a working cheese farm and wood shoe factory as well. I would recommend this tour for bike and non bike enthusiasts. You don't need to be in great shape as it's mostly flat terrain but you ride for over 3 hours so be prepared. Great tour and at this price a must do in Amsterdam."

The country tour with Joy Ride was an absolutely wonderful experience, even though it rained for half the tour. Allison is a great guide, with lots of enthusiasm and knowledge of the sights we passed. My daughter is 30 and I'm 63 and the riding was easy for both of us. Being out in the country and along the houseboats on the canals was truly a breath of fresh air. We joined others for a group of eight and all of had a great time. Sean takes the time to make sure the bikes are fitted for each rider, raingear was provided so we all stayed relatively dry. There is a stop at a cheese farm/dutch shoe factory which, while interesting, could have been just a bit shorter in time.As we came back to the drop off point, a local ran into my daughter and started to yell at her. Sean stepped in and calmly took control of the situation, reminding the local of his failure to ring his bell as a warning that he was coming through. No one hurt and a crisis averted.I would recommend this couple and their tour to anyone. You will have a fabulous time and remember it much more than any canal cruise."

I'm a basic traveler - I like seeing the sights, enjoying the people and trying to get a glimpse into the everyday life of a place. Too often I find myself getting sucked into tourist traps as a result of suggestions from well meaning fellow travelers. Wasting even a few hours of your time when it is so limited hits hard. I've been to Amsterdam on a few occasions and continue to find new things to do. Of all the time I've spent in Amsterdam, perhaps the best use of my time and most enjoyable day I've had was spent with Joy Ride Tours. We got to see so much diversity in such a small city - I was blown away at what I had missed on my previous trips. What's more, I'm a big active sports person so finding an activity that allowed me to get the heart rate going a bit, although the cycling was very easy and relaxing, was very much appreciated. I can't express my enjoyment of the tour enough - Alison was incredibly personable, fun and knowledgable. You could tell she loved the city and enjoyed sharing it with those on her tour. If you want to see Amsterdam and stretch the legs out a bit, the Joy Ride Bike Tours is the answer. Some of the best money I've ever spent while traveling - easily my favorite tour and one of my favorite guides of all I've met.A must do activity in Amsterdam. I'll definitely go again if I return."

Meeting centrally we walked a short stroll to pick up our bikes, great bikes too, a pack on the back to hold your personal items, help adjusting the right bike to suit your height. The group had a short lesson with riding in Amsterdam which can be quite daunting.The tour was historical as we were lead out of the city. Was a beautiful feeling riding free. This tour included a stop for lunch at a cheese and clog making factory, a farmer with a few cows and machine turning clogs, but he does show you original way. You must take your lunch unless you wish to buy cheese to nibble on. The shop here was great, clogs everywhere and cheese tasting, yumm. Small gifts of all sorts. Next stop a close up with a windmill, we were very lucky to see it move, our guide Alice in 5 yrs had not seen it move on a tour! Half day tour excellent for $40 AUS Alice very informative with historical and country way of life here. Love Amsterdam."

Besides leading the tour and sharing LOTS of information about the Netherlands, she did her utmost to keep us safe and together. We would recommend this tour to anyone looking to find out more about the Netherlands and wanting to explore the countryside. Make sure to bring water and a snack. From time to time, Allison will have the group stop for an explanation, photos, etc. Since we never ride without helmets, we asked for helmets for the ride, such a foreign thing to do in the Netherlands. I was worried we would be supplied with not so great helmets but we were supplied with excellent ones. The bikes this tour company uses are of excellent quality as well and they were set up for people of varying heights. We booked ahead and online and doing so will save you a little bit of money. We felt the price was reasonable. Joyride Tours has put a great deal of thought into your ride and if we were to come again, I am sure we would consider choosing this company.

To be honest, we were a bit apprehensive with the idea of riding a bike in or near Amsterdam where bikes and cars seem to share the space and do so in such a coordinated manner that it seemed like an experience one could have after a lifetime of practice. The Joy Ride Tours introduced us to our bikes and the rules of the road and shortly we were on our way. We rode through part of Vondel Park and past many canals and houseboats arriving at Amstelveen. Along the way we learned the function of windmills and how the land was cleared. Our ride was informative and a ton of fun. At no time did it really feel scary to ride across the road as the instructor was very good at telling us how to enter the lane of traffic. In Amstelveen we visited a farm and saw a demo of clog making and sampled cheese after a brief overview of how cheese was made there. A quick re-application of sunblock (bring some!) and we were on our way back to the city to return our bikes. This experience gave us great joy during our vacation and allowed us to participate in a very Dutch experience. Thank you to the Joy Ride Tours for such a wonderful time."

Despite some reviewers saying the cheese and clog farm being too touristy, I think they're wrong -it's one of those occasions that should be taken at face value. Yes, it was a smidge touristy (not overly touristy) but it was fun, we are still laughing about the quirky farmer and him calling people \"happy lady\" and \"happy man\" and just how often in life do you get the chance to see someone make clogs and get yummy cheese from a real working farm? And let me tell you the cheese is good. The garlic and mustard cheese is superb! We brought some home with us back to California and only wish we'd brought more.Overall, this is a fun, relaxing, informative and very scenic tour that is a must do while in Amsterdam. Plus, at the end of the tour Joy Rides gives you a great list of recommended restaurants and their top 75 best things to do in Amsterdam list. Thanks, Joy Ride!!!!"

He was so knowledgeable about the city and it's history, the bikes were new and top of the line and we rode through Amsterdam neighborhoods that were off the beaten path. Our tour was 3-4 hours and we were having such a great time that we spent an extra half hour with Sean chatting at a restaurant in the park! It is clear that Sean is passionate about what he does and works hard to customize his tours to the individual interests of his clients. This was truly a memorable tour and Amsterdam experience. If we ever come back to Amsterdam, we will absolutely book another tour with Sean and Joy Ride tours as we felt we had just scratched the surface of his deep reservoir of knowledge."

We lucked out that they had a cancellation for the 19th of July, so we quickly booked a city tour for the 19th via their web site. Quite simply this was one of the highlights of our trip. As Sean explained to us, there is almost a 2:1 ratio between bikes and people of Amsterdam, so doing anything by bike in Amsterdam is to truly live like a resident of the city. I think the best part of the tour is the fact these are private tours; it was Sean and the two of us for a good 4 hours hitting all the major areas of Amsterdam. Also, his tours are not a one tour fits all; depending on your tastes (i.e. WWII / foodie / etc...) he will tailor the tour to what interests you the most. His knowledge of the city was incredible and he will share stories/data that you would never find in a guide book. He will also treat you to some local foods that you may not try on your own. Try the herring and fried cod cheeks!! They also have a country tour which will be on our agenda the next time we come to Amsterdam. Great fun!!"

She made it so much fun, and is more than happy to give you hint n tips to travel around. As I've travelled around euro, I'm realizing a bike tour is a fantastic way to see a bunch in a short time.

No need to worry if you have not been on a bicycle in some years, the land is mostly flat and there is very little time spent in the city centre. You cycle through parks, forests and into the country, spend an enjoyable half an hour with a local farmer who shows you how cheese and clogs are made on his farm. A bit further on from the farm and you stop at a windmill that was built in 1600 and something. Sean is a mind of information and made the day a really enjoyable one. Thank you Sean see you for our 35th wedding anniversary :-)"

It was a great tour from start to finish.Pros:- It was a leisurely paced ride, with ample stops for history, discussion, or just for her to show us something really cool.- We got some great photos, and she knew all the best places to take them, too. - We saw a lot more of the city and surrounding area than we would have by any other method. I definitely would recommend taking one of their tours. Completely enjoyable.- It was great for adults and kids too - provided they're big enough to ride an adult bike. No drinking or annoying carousing going on, which while in Amsterdam, can be hard to find.Cons:- None. We had a spectacular time. Wish we had taken a longer tour, and probably a private one."

Allison was our guide and her knowledge and enthusiasm for her adopted city / country shone through. She was very personable and was able to handle the diverse range of people on our tour who had differing abilities, languages and cultural needs. The bikes were good, new and well-maintained with lightweight frames so younger and older people as well as cycle novices would be comfortable on this tour. If I was being picky I'd say that the farm part was a bit over-commercial and aimed at the tourist's pockets with a surprisingly large gift shop but if you don't have to buy anything and it didn't detract from getting out into the countryside. Overall it was a really good day run by experts with a a clear passion for their job which can only be good for the customer. I can highly recommend this tour."

Although you do visit a cheese factory with a shop attached I never felt pressure to buy, and there was no cross-selling of other tours which is refreshing. Definitely recommend booking online, bring lunch with you but no need to bring a raincoat as they are supplied if necessary.

This tour is ideal if, like me, you're a bit nervous of cycling round the busy parts of Amsterdam. A short ride through Vondelpark and we were in the countryside. Sean was so knowledgeable and i learnt more about Amsterdam in that few hours than i have done on all my previous visits to the city. The pace was perfect to take in all the sites and even with a group of 14 and different ages, shapes and sizes, nobody felt slow or a hindrance.

They supply rain gear if needed. Amsterdam is a bike community. Leaving the city and riding through the park and Amstelveen was a pleasure. The ride was about 24km but had a leisurely pace and was not stressful. There were many stops along the way including a working dairy farm (we bought some Gouda) and a market where we enjoyed the local food. The Herring was SO GOOD---you have to try it.

I am not as fit as I use to be but was able to stay with the group. We loved the fact that it was a great day to ride and learned a lot about the city. You are taken to a real clog and cheese factory and get to see a lot of the flora and fauna. I highly recommend this to all ages!"

            "review": "Great day out! What a beautiful country and tour!. We did this tour in September. It obviously has to rank up there as the best tour to do in Amsterdam.  Things started off fine, but I happened to stop to take a photo of the statue of Vondell in Vondell park and when I came back around 20 seconds later the group was long gone. The park was full of hundreds of cyclists that day since it was a Saturday, and I now had no way of catching up to the group or my wife, who I had advised to stick with the group whenever I stopped to take a photo. Well after cycling down numerous paths and only seeing hundreds of other cyclists and trees blocking the views in the distance I had to go back to the office. They then sent someone out with me and we were lucky enough to find my wife who had gotten lost looking for me and eventually caught up with the rest of the group. Word of warning.. Stay close to everyone in Vondell park. It is like a maze and there is no way at all to get your bearings. Our guide Yuri was very apologetic and even bought everyone a beer to have with our lunch to help make up for the extra 45 minutes we had to add to the tour because of the mishap.  We finished the tour and got to do everything though and missed nothing. Got some nice pics of windmills and the cheese factory. It was just awesome being out in the dutch countryside, and feeling my roots with Dutch ancestors. Its so surprising to find beautiful countryside like this so close to a major urban city. I would not have missed this for the world!!!  NOTE:THIS TOUR IS NOT FOR EVERYONE AND ESPECIALLY NOT FOR BEGINNING CYCLISTS OR PEOPLE WITH A LOW FITNESS LEVEL. You need to possess a medium cycle skill level and enough stamina for all these kilometers fo cycling. It seemed to me like a very very long ride coming back especially after running all around Europe for the past week. It was at least 30km ride for me, since I had already done alot of fast pedaling looking for my wife in Vondell park. Honestly it took me weeks to recover from this ride since we really didn't have much rest on our trip to Europe. I was still feeling tired in the quads 4 days later in Paris when doing a night cycling tour, and again when doing a cycle tour of Versaille which I was barely able to finish. That being said, I recommend this tour 100%. It's so perfect to get away from the crowds of Amsterdam and breath some fresh air and see the countryside. Don't miss it!"

It can be a little harrowing at first, but once you race through a couple of intersections all fears of a collision are gone; just remember to use your bell in the pedestrian areas.My wife and I did our tour just a couple hours after arriving in town, which was a fun and easy way to get the lay of the land and scout out some places to stop by later in our stay. It was a cold day, so there were only 4 of us on the tour, but that only made it better. We were able to make a couple of fun stops with a little more flexibility than if we had a full group. We stopped at Wynand Fockink for some genever. Our tour guide talked us into posing for a photo in the giant clog at Dam Square, with the cheesy moment now displayed proudly in our home."

We chose Joy Ride Tours in Amsterdam and booked the Windmills, Clogs and Cheese tour that takes you outside the city. It was fantastic!The tour was one of the highlights of our time in Amsterdam (and that is saying a lot because Amsterdam has so much to offer). Our tour guide was Yuri (hope I spelled that correctly) and he was great. Entertaining and funny and with a wealth of historical and cultural information on Amsterdam and the countryside. He also gave us an appreciation for the ability that Amsterdam (a city below sea level) has in redirecting and containing the water that surrounds the city. It was fascinating.We chose the Windmill, Clog and Cheese tour because we wanted to get out of the city and see some of the countryside and because it was a longer tour. 40% of the people in Amsterdam are on bikes so navigating the streets in the city by bike can be a little stressful. You have to watch where you are going and can't really sight see. Getting out of the city was the way to go. The tour was long but not tedious or tiring. You go at an easy pace and make informational and photo stops along the way. Although some reviewers found the the clog and cheese stop a little commercial, we thought it was great. And just sampling the cheese was worth the stop. Do buy a sample of their Gouda. Delicious! The bikes themselves are sturdy and very comfortable. Nice big seats! They have roomy saddlebags so you can bring a jacket, camera, etc. and definitely bring food with you. This tour does not stop for snacks or lunch."

We were travelling through Amsterdam for 3 days and had booked in with Joy Ride on our first day for the Windmills, Cheese and Clogs tour, and without doubt it was the highlight. Our tour guide was Allison, she was absolutely lovely and provided insightful commentary throughout the day. She also provided us with heaps of recommendations for restaurants and things to do for the rest of our stay. We were both a little nervous about riding bikes (because we haven't ridden since our teenage years!) and in Amsterdam, where there are literally thousands of bikes everywhere. But the tour takes you out of town into the country side (even though its only a few kms outside Amsterdam) and was a relaxed pace and easy ride. We were luckily enough to book in on the last public tour of the season, but Alison mentioned that she also arranges private tours. I would definitely recommend this tour !"

They never rushed, and made the tour enjoyable. The bikes look like they're in good shape. You don't really need to be fit for this ride. I'm a bit of a cyclist myself, so this is not going to be much of a workout if you're looking for a physical challenge. It was certainly fun to ride the bike in the country and visit the mill. The tourguide was kind enough to take pictures of you, and seemed good at taking pictures as he seems to do this quite often (-: I cannot remember the name of our tour guide, but he was from Australia, I believe.I didn't take any snacks. The ride was not that arduous. It's a good idea to take some water though. Note that their bikes have some bags in the back, so you can pack a few small items. Some of the people who rode took a sweater (note that I rode at the end of August).The cheese farm was ok. I was ok with this part of the tour because: 1)although they do try to sell you stuff at the end of the tour, nobody is pushy about it, 2)it's interesting to talk to the people who run the farm, 3)you get to see them build those wooden shoes. The people who run that tour are not part of Joy Ride Tours. It made the bike tour a bit more diverse, lets just say (-:"

People tend to focus on the more explicitly fun side of Amsterdam, such as red light district, or the famous coffee houses. But those are not the only things that Amsterdam has to offer. This tour guides you to parks, water gates, dikes, and farms, a cheese maker, and a windmill. It lets you experience the quiet, peaceful, yet very interesting side of Amsterdam.If you had to choose one tour in Amsterdam, I think this should be it.As for the red light district, coffee houses, or canals, you can guide yourself. They are mostly located in the central area of the city. But this tour takes you to rather hidden gems of Amsterdam. I definitely recommend this tour. My guide was Yuri, and he does not need any description. You want to go with him. He is not only pleasant and cheerful but he also knows practically everything you have to ask about Amsterdam and its suburban areas.Definitely worth the twenty something euro."

The tour operators have a well thought out path, so you leave the hustle of the main streets of Amsterdam and tour around the outskirts of the city in a landscape that includes parks and farmland and lovely residential areas. You ride a little, stop and hear about the city (the history, water engineering, culture, monarchy, etc.), and then ride a little more. Our tour guide Yuri impressed us with his knowledge and enthusiasm. Remember to pack lunch, it is not provided and can be stored on the saddlebags on the bike, as can purses. The level of fitness required is moderate - the route is flat and there is lots of starting and stopping."

We were lucky with the weather which stayed mostly sunny but they give you ponchos in case it goes the other way. I was a bit worried at first having not ridden a bicycle in over 10 years but after the initial wobbly start it was smooth sailing for all of us. We stopped at a few nice locations and Yuri did a great job of filling us in on the history of it all. We eventually made our way out of the city and through the wetlands and forest to a tradition cheese farm which also makes clogs. Was very interesting and we picked up some lovely cheese to take home. All up we rode about 22km and it was a great day out - would highly recommend to anyone thinking of doing it and I hope you get Yuri as your guide as he was great."

You get to explore a bit of downtown Amsterdam, the park, suburbs and countryside (Amstelveen). The tour lasted about five hours, and there is a stop at a farm where you can buy homemade cheese (true) and homemade clogs (FALSE).After a brief tour of how cheese is made, and how the clogs are \"homemade\" and sold on premises, I made up my mind that was going to purchase and schlep clogs all over Europe for my nieces because I thought it would be a nice story. I found two pairs that looked nice. They both had flowers and looked as though the painting on the clogs was applied with a sticker and not by hand. I asked the man who showed us how clogs are made if the clogs I choose were actually made at the farm. He told me that they were made there and then they painted them and then applied a sticker on top for the intricate art detail. So I bought them. Packing up those clogs city to city was a real pain, but once again, I was excited to send them to my nieces with a note when I returned to the states telling them the cool story about how I biked to a clog farm and bought them HOMEMADE clogs.When I got home, I decided to look a little closer. There were barcode stickers on the inside of the clogs. I goggled the name of the company, and the clogs are actually mass-produced by this company: http://www.woodenshoes.com/Over-ons.aspx \"THE LARGEST WOODEN SHOE FACTORY IN THE WORLD\"Talk about a bait & switch. \u20ac21 a pair.I know that Joy Ride cannot control what I purchase, but they should be aware of this. The tour is called \"cheese and clogs\", right? I could've just had these mass-produced crap clogs shipped directly to my nieces instead of taking such care of them all over Europe. With all that aside, the ride was great. I'm just a little annoyed that I did not have an authentic experience. It's like buying Godiva and getting Hershey\u2019s - leaves a bad taste in your mouth."

No busy streets until the end when riders were more acclimated to the bike and traffic. There were several stops to rest and listen to the guide talk- mostly interesting, but dragging on a bit much. We biked through several different areas- houseboats, woods, a lake, along the river. One rider had a flat tire which the guide took care of very efficiently with little inconvenience to the other riders. The only thing keeping this tour from an excellent rating for me was the stop at the cheese/wooden shoe farm. It was a blatant attempt to get you to buy something, and the \"tour\" of the premises was not very well done. How many folks on a bicycle are going to buy full size wooden shoes anyway? An alternative rest period could be a stop at a cafe, or even a picnic in a park. Overall, the tour was good, and I'd recommend it as a nice day out of the city."

            "review": "\"Best thing I've ever done in Amsterdam!\". Having been to Amsterdam twelve or so times I thought it was about time I hoped on a bike. I\u2019m so glad I chose joy ride tours for my first Amsterdam cycle experience. As a single traveller I was made to feel welcome and included without anything being to OTT. We meet Alison (who runs the business with her husband) outside the Rijksmuseum as advised when booking after a few minutes\u2019 walk around the corner we were taken to our bikes, not having ridden for about ten years I was a bit apprehensive but it all turned out fine as we made a short ride to Vondelpark where we were given some historical and interesting info by Alison. We then headed off through the park and off to see some rather posh house boats, the 1928 Olympic stadium, then into the Amsterdam woods. After another quick stop and more interesting, if gruesome facts we were off out into the Dutch country side. I have to say this was amazingly beautifully, although I\u2019m sure the lovely sunny weather helped! We visited a farm, which for me was a bit naff, the supposed crazy farmer was clearly going through the motions which the American tourists seemed to love, but hey each to their own and all. We then headed off along the Amstel (I think) river and back towards Amsterdam, this is where things got a little hairy, if you\u2019re not used to Dutch road cycling! It was really fun though if a little scary. I\u2019ll defiantly be doing the tour again next time I\u2019m in Amsterdam. The only way this tour could be improved is if the guys charged more, went further out into the countryside and including their love and knowledge of food and restaurants by including lunch in the tour, all in all though an amazingly good value for money tour which I\u2019d highly recommend. P.S there are two toilet stops on the tour."

We didn't feel comfortable going out and renting our own bike, so we booked the windmills, cheese and clog factory bike tour. The bikes were in amazing shape and our guide was super informative. We loved getting to see the outskirts of the city, especially the trails alongside the river. The owner also was wonderful and gave us a sheet full of great restaurant recommendations. Definitely a great add-on to our trip."

The tour guide was great, stopping lots and sharing all kinds of information. Some of the information was relevant to the site we were pausing at, and others were just bits of informational trivia. We even had an opportunity to stop at a less popular 'I Amsterdam' sign for a photo op. Don't be too concerned about the stressfulness of the bike ride, it was a slow, relaxing bike ride on an almost flat terrain. Perfect for almost any fitness level. The bikes were in excellent condition!! One thing to note is that the Cheese and clog section of the tour is almost secondary, not the focus. If that is something that you really want to spend a lot of time on, you may want to look into another tour.I could not recommend this tour more! Book it today!"

(The Iamsterdam sign in museumplain) Yuri was an excellent guide informative, fun and friendly. First we were off to get the bicycles which was a short walk. The bikes are comfortable and you ride sitting upright. Then it was off to Vondelpark, where we had a fun \"history lesson\". We had multiple stops along our 4-5 hour tour where Yuri served us fun and informative stories. We had some longer stops at a beautiful bridge, a sluice system, lake with house boats, a cheese factory/clog factory (with an over the top intens owner), windmill, and multiple other stops along the road. The pace is nice, and you don't need to struggle to keep up. Very safe. At the end of our trip those interested would receive recommendation for restaurants in Amsterdam.Easily 5 stars. They go beyond what that could be expected."

Our guide met us at the appointed time and looked after our group of thirteen people very well. The bikes were in excellent condition and were very easy to ride.We started our tour by going through a large park where the guide stopped and explained some of the history of the place. We saw house boats, the canal locks, the Polders fields, and the countryside. We stopped at a cheese and clog making farm and tasted the cheeses. The people here were very nice.The only slight drawback is that there is no stop for coffee or something to eat. The tour starts at 10.30 and finishes around 3.30 so it is a long time to go without food. We did bring a snack as recommended by other tripadvisor reviewers but there was very little opportunity to eat it and it seems rude to eat in front of the others in the group when they had no food. I would recommend the company to include a twenty minute stop for a coffee somewhere and make this an even better day out. This was a great tour and we were very pleased we decided to do it."

My wife and I are hosting a visitor from abroad and found the Country Tour to have plenty to offer for all of us - whether a tourist from the US seeing Holland for the first time or two expats that have been in Amsterdam for 2.5 years.I don't like to give too much away, as I think not knowing what's around each bend adds much to the pleasure of this experience. For starters, the group included short and tall people and young and old people, many of which had not been on a bike for some period. JRTs has bikes of all sizes and the pace is incredibly relaxed - no one had any problems with the physical part of the tour.The attractions were great - at the expense of learning about Amsterdam in particular, we learned about the Dutch and how they used ingenuity and practicality over the last 800 years to develop their own unique way of live. Yuri guided us through the sun, wind and shade and a wonderful variety of architecture, agriculture, industry, and culture. He was entertaining throughout and kept the history lessons amusing and light-hearted. Sean, the owner, was also incredibly helpful and accommodating and made use each feel like valued customers.Upon logging in to TA to leave this review, I was so pleasantly surprised to see JRT as the #2 attraction in A'dam. I'm so glad to see JRT getting the recognition it deserves here on TA.Take the tour! And when you do so, make sure to bring layers (even on a beautiful day, the wind can be nuisance) and also bring some water and a snack. By the time we made it to the cheese factory, we were very grateful for the Albert Hein sandwiches and sliced fruits we'd brought along in advance. And it's also probably useful to know that you definitely should make a reservation in advance, and I recall Sean offering before we got started to store some personal items for customers in case they had things they prefer not to take on the tour."

Since tour sizes are kept small, with a guide in front and back, it was easy to keep up. You never go very fast, and there are breaks every 20 minutes or so yo see points of interest, learn about sites, and take pictures. Allison was very good at making sure everyone had their pictures taken, what angle was good, etc. The cheese and clog stop was so funny, and a lovely break in the middle of the day.

Hands down, this was the best thing I did there. And yes, that includes the coffee shops. We did the country tour as part of a group with Alison as our guide (their last group tour of the year). A knowledgable, engaging and humorous individual, she did an excellent job of orienting us to the city as well as the beautiful countryside and showed us another side of Amsterdam and the surrounding areas that we have never gotten to see or appreciate. The trip of 22 kilometers was well-paced, with plenty of stops, explanations, responses to questions, bathroom break, etc. Parks, a windmill, cheesemaking, clog making, canals, birds, levees and boathouses! Fortuitously, we did the tour early in our visit, which provided an excellent overview and tons of info that we wouldn't have had otherwise. Alison and her husband, Sean, also gave us handouts of their favorite places which proved helpful in providing new ideas on places to go or validating other recommendations that we already had. While we are regular but casual bikers, do not be intimidated at all by what might seem to be a long trip (it's not). It's done over a period of four hours or so and is paced in a way that literally anyone who can ride a bike will be able to do this. The terrain is flat and the equipment is really good. If this wasn't the last group tour of the year and if the private tours weren't fully booked, I would have booked other excursions with them during the course of our stay. Alison and Sean: thank you so much! Great job."

He is very knowledgeable and added a new view of the city for us. We totally loved the cheese and clogs farm...oh gosh, I loved petting the calves...so cute!! What amazed me was that my husband loved the tour. He was skeptical at first, when I invited him to go with me, because he doesnt like riding bikes, but when he met Adam, I could feel he felt more confortable. Thank you Adam for all your attention and parience with us!! I will definitely recommend this tour to all my friends going to Amsterdam!"

He knew so much about the city and we rode through the beautiful countryside. It's kind of shocking thinking about how the the entire city was man-made on top of swamps. We rode through the city and stopped the windmills where we sampled some great cheese. Of course we saw windmills and even saw an area where the luxury houseboats were docked. Everyone who went on the tour was really friendly and the staff provided us with maps and directions to our next destination after our ride was over. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who visits Amsterdam!"

The bikes are so easy to ride and its so flat that you don't need to be a fitness fanatic to enjoy it. If you have a big group id definitely recommend booking a private tour."

The company was very flexible because I had to reschedule to another day and they were fully accommodating. The owner made sure that I was comfortable and able on the bike, which I wasn't initially since I haven't been biking for a while. I am a wobbly rider and except for a few stretches of the tour where we had to ride next to cars and traffic, I felt that most of the ride was very relaxing and comfortable. We made several picturesque stops and at each stop Adam would fill us in on some facts about the city. We also stopped at the cheese and clogs shop, which was fine for the most part except for the clogs guy who was a bit creepy (you know...like that weird uncle at family reunions). Anyhow, with most tours it's usually the tour guide who makes or breaks the experience, and Adam definitely showed us a good time with his enthusiasm and thoughtfulness! After we got back to the shop, the owner came out and helped us with any other information we may need about the city. He was really helpful with the questions we had. These are really great guys and the tour was a good value as well. Highly recommend even though I don't like biking!"

The tour is 4h30 long and starts with Vondel park then takes you out of the city passing along house boats, through a large park, by a windmill and stopping at a cheese farm before taking the Amstel river banks back to the city.We stopped along the way and Adam would talk about the history of Amsterdam and the different places we saw. We liked the way he told the different stories and feel we learned a lot about the city from him.The cheese farm tour was nice but the farmer who did the tour had a funny sense of humor and was a bit commercial, but we enjoyed it non the less.The biked were very comfortable but watch out for the grease on the chain, it can easily get on your clothes if you don't pay attention. Adam was very accommodating with participant who had problems either by trading his bike or lending them a sweater.Be sure to bring a sandwich and some water, you can store them in the packs attached to the bike. We had good weather, but in case of colder weather gloves and a hat as well as warm clothes are a must. One of the best tour experiences we ever had!"

This tour is ideal for Day #1 or #2 of your trip, as the guide will tell you alot about Amsterdam, what to do and what to see, as well as what the locals do - and you will start to see what he has been talking about during your next few days touring Amsterdam. If you take this tour only at the end of your trip in Amsterdam, it would be a waste of all the knowledge gained not being put in practice!The guide (we got Adam) brought us around the countryside for a great view of out-of-city- Amsterdam. We took the Cheese, clogs, and windmill tour - I didn't like the cheese and clogs factory as i found it incredibly touristy - but the route we took to-and-from the factory more than made up for that! The scenery was beautiful and the windmill was totally picturesque, better so if there is good weather!Note that when booking online, you will be asked to Print out the receipt upon online payment - however that is not necessary so long as you have identification with you - as many tourists will not have access to a printer.At the end of the tour, you will be given a map and a list and description of good things to eat/see/do specially recommended by Joy Ride Tours, which is another reason why I recommend scheduling this cycling tour at the start (rather than in the middle/at the end) of your trip to Amsterdam - there is great fun in hunting down the recommendations!Important NOTE: the meeting point is at Museumplein (It is directly behind the Rijks Museum, BETWEEN the Cobra Cafe and the Museum Shop, near to the northeast end of the long pool). Take careful note of that!!! If you miss the tour, you can rebook it without extra charge provided the session for that day is not fully booked."

Also really enjoyed stopping at the brewery near the windmill. The perfect intro to Amsterdam! A couple days later we took the country tour with Allison. Despite a few showers, we enjoyed riding through the countryside \u2013 a more relaxed ride with scenery much different than the city. We had rain jackets, but Allison had ponchos for those who didn\u2019t. We\u2019d recommend bringing food on the country tour, which is longer and runs during the lunch hour. You can picnic at the cheese farm, where the tour stops along the way. Highly recommend Joy Ride and both tours if you have the time. As a side note, we rode bikes in four cities on our trip and the ones from Joy Ride were the most comfortable and in the best condition."

It took a lot of us a little bit to get used to the bikes, you're sitting upright rather than leaning forward, but they took very little effort to pedal and Amsterdam and it's surrounds are quite flat so it's a very easy ride overall. There are quite a few stops along the tour including a houseboat community, Olympic rowing lake, windmill, cheese and clogs farm, and a garden, at which the tour guide spent quite a bit of time explaining the history and significance of each area. Since the tour goes over the lunch period, I would recommend bringing a snack and drink as we were quite hungry by the end! Each bicycle has a large zippered bag on the side to store your belongings which is great. We purchased our tickets a few days in advance (it saves you a few Euros to purchase online) and found the tour meeting point easily enough, near the \"IAmsterdam\" sign behind the Rjiks Museum. I would highly recommend this tour, particularly if it's your first time to Amsterdam."

We easily found the meeting place and were part of about 15 people for the day's ride. The leader was \"Petra\" who was beyond enthusiastic, to say the least. She was full of information and clearly enjoyed leading the bike tours, chatting with people, etc. She made a few stops along the way (there and back) to provide a historical perspective on Amsterdam as well as an overview of what we were seeing. She was open to any questions one would have and made the visit \"come alive\". The trip to the cheese farm was much better than the cheese farm itself which was a little \"cheesey\" (excuse the pun). The farmer was a little creepy and clearly held the monopoly on being the closest cheese farm to the city as there were 2-3 other bike tour groups onsite at the same time. I could have easily skipped the cheese farm visit but it served as our ultimate destination so it was hard to avoid it, but it didn't detract from the enjoyment of the day on the bike and in the countryside. We saw things we would never have otherwise seen and the price was quite reasonable. Would definitely recommend, but don't expect much at the cheese farm other than a toilet stop and a \"cheesey\" gift shop."

As a family of four, with two teenagers, we love bike tours as they provide the best way to see the sights, learn some history and interact with our guides. With this company, the email communication in advance of the tour was fantastic. We decided to go on two tours. First up was the City tour with Shawn. He was extremely knowledgeable and in addition to providing contemporary history, also gave us a snapshot of the history of Amsterdam for the past 400 years. Traveling by bike in Amsterdam is very safe as you have your own bike lanes rather than riding on the road. Our country tour was given by Adam. This was a more relaxing scenic tour ultimately ending at a farm where they made clogs and cheese. While also enjoyable, a lot of the history of Amsterdam was a repeat of what we had learned from the City tour. Not sure if I can recommend going on both tours for only that one reason. I highly recommend this company though for at least one of the trips. Do also recommend grabbing something to eat before either of the trips."

The bikes were comfortable and seemed well-maintained, and they had helmets available for those of us more used to riding through hair-raising NYC traffic. Adam was an engaging guide, full of interesting and well-presented historical information and anecdotes at our several stops along the way. My favorite was seeing the gorgeous houseboats and barges! At the end of the tour we were given Joy Ride's restaurant recommendations--we went to one for a late lunch directly after the ride and it was delicious! The only negative, and it is very slight and is really nothing to do with the ride or Joy Ride, is that the man who runs the cheese and clog farm where we stop for a taste and clogmaking demonstration, seemed certifiably crazy and more than a bit creepy. And this was noted independently by everyone on our tour, so it wasn't just me!! But this shouldn't stop you from taking this tour--a very professional organization, great guide, wonderful experience overall."

Everything about this tour was great (right down to the weather, but I guess Joy Ride can't take credit for that!)Two tours are offered (city and country), and I had some difficulty choosing. In the end, I'm glad I went the country route. The roads were less crowded (with people and fellow bikers) and it was a wonderful way to see things outside of the city - from houseboats to a cheese/clog farm and some really beautiful scenery. Further on in Europe, I met some backpackers who took a city tour (not with Joy Ride) and they confirmed - it can be tough to maintain a peaceful \"enjoy the outdoors\" vibe when navigating the city streets.Adam was a terrific guide - fun, friendly, and informative. We took several bike tours during our trip to Europe and I can say that he was definitely most concerned about \"the group\", as a whole. For example, he would stop at intersection lights to make sure everyone could get through together. This sounds like a minor detail but think about what a pain it is to keep following someone when they get through the light and you don't!The tour seems to attract a lot of really nice people and we met some fun fellow travelers. Again, I think Adam set the tone by making introductions early on, and small talk about where people are from.Definitely the most (wholesome!) fun you can have in Amsterdam!"

My daughter (29) and I took a Joy Ride bike tour last week into the Amsterdam countryside and it was one of the best things we did during our three days in Amsterdam. Our guide, Adam, was friendly, informative and full of interesting information regarding Amsterdam's history, The bicycles seemed new and in perfect condition. It was fantastic riding out into the countryside, through beautiful parks and along back roads. We also visited a windmill and cheese factory where they made clogs as well. Along the way, we stopped for photo ops and lots of interesting commentary from Adam. By the way, for those of you who are possibly concerned that the long bike ride will be difficult, I just want to add that the terrain is practically flat and we went at a very comfortable speed.Our Joy Ride tour was a wonderful way to see the outskirts of Amsterdam and I highly recommend it!"

He even told us some stories about dragons as we (to be honest only me) requested it. It's a must do if you are visiting Amsterdam, no matter how long you'll be staying. The countryside tour is so beautiful and relaxing as Amsterdam has a beauty beyond the canals and the too crowded places. Everything is flat, so you won't be tired after the tour. Book your tour and enjoy :)"

Adam is a friendly, knowledgeable guide, and he loves showing people around. The \"rural\" ride takes one through Vondel Park into the outskirts of the city. You see houseboats, windmills, and lots of picturesque vistas. The visit to the cheese factory is a bit \"cheesy,\" and it would have been better to have just a bit more biking and fewer stops, but this is an excellent operation and a great way to get away from the touristy areas of Amsterdam. I highly recommend Joy Ride tours."

The tour is 4.5 hours long though, so bring water and a snack/lunch, otherwise you will be famished. There is no real opportunity to buy this along the way. The only down part for me was the \"clog maker\" - he's too tacky, just hoping to sell you stuff. But other than that, definitely a worthwhile."

We had scheduled for a day that dawned raining in torrents, we went to the meeting place because they said they would come out even in bad weather, but the guide was kind and let us come back the next day because the forecast was for good weather. We came back the day after and luckily it was sunny. We strolled through a park, where there was a Picasso just there, out in the open, then went to see an old windmill and visited a farm where they made cheese and clogs (dutch wooden shoes). It was a wonderful ride, and the guide was perfect! I can't remember her name, but she was Adam's Australian cousin and very nice. Remember to book in advance, there are a limited number of people allowed in each tour."

If you are not that fit or worried about riding around Amsterdam (the only city in the world with more bikes than people) don\u2019t worry. I never once felt scared and there are no hills in Amsterdam so fitness is not an issue. Not only did we have lots of laughs we got to experience some Dutch food and beers and got lots of photo opportunities especially in front of the windmills (which was my personal request). After the tour Petra marked a few places on our map which we did end up going to and really enjoyed. If you are looking at doing something different and fun I would totally recommend the Joy Ride Tours."

The tour was well paced, not strenuous and very informative. Our guide Petra was a good laugh. We could have done without the stop for a drink but that was just an opportunity to get to know the other riders. Group was small...only 10 people which was excellent.

We did the Country Tour which did a little bit in the city before going through the Vondel Park and into the country to the north of Amsterdam, which was a lot less stress than trying to ride in amongst all the cyclists in the city! The tour guide Adam while not Dutch (he's actually an Aussie) is passionate about Amsterdam and provides lots of very interesting information about the history of the city and what life is like living there. The tour is not strenuous at all and anyone who can ride a bike should be enjoy the tour and feel a little bit like a local.Two points of advice if taking this tour are that you need to take something to eat because there is no stop for lunch and you won't get much to eat at the cheese farm and secondly the cheese farm only takes cash, not cards."

Our group of 10 cyclists included people from Greece, Germany, Canada and the USA. Everyone felt welcome and learned in-depth, local perspective information on a wide range of topics including: the history of The Netherlands and Amsterdam, WWII, The Red Light District, Amsterdam's music and drug cultures. A short stop for a local beverage along the way, and many great photo oppotunities were appreciated. Incredible local insight. A slight mixup in tour costs prompted the owner to practically insist on the entire fee be refunded. We allowed a simple correction. I would have felt too guilty to not pay for such a fantastic tour.

We needed something to do on Saturday which would (a) help us recover from Friday night and (b) stay out of the bars until lunch time! We were heading to the Northern Ireland v Holland match that evening so we had a few hours to kill. I decided that instead of traipsing around museums and breweries that it would be much better to get a bit of history and combine this with some exercise and a bike tour seemed to fit the bill perfectly. The only worry was that none of us had been on a bike in over 10 years! I emailed a few of the companies and decided on Joyride Tours as the reviews were very good and they did a tour that sounded like it would suit us. ie beer stops on the way with a bit of history. We also decided the stag should have a nice pink bike and this was arranged no bother. It was great to find on the day of the tour that Sean was our host as I had been corresponding with him by email and he knew exactly the idea and the form for what we wanted from the tour. It also helped that the weather was fantastic! Sean gave us a great insight during the tour with a bit of history and geography as well as stopping at 2 lovely local pubs for a few \"small\" beers. After the tour he told us to contact him if we had any questions about Amsterdam during our stay or had any problems which was very nice and beyond the call of duty, He gave us a lot of advice on where to go and where not to go and what restaurants and pubs to try and which to avoid.It was a great 3-4 hour tour and very good value for money. I would recommend this for groups of guys or girls as something a bit different but could also suit families and those only interested in finding out about Amsterdam's history. I hope to be back soon and I would do the bike tour again."

Sean, the owner and an American expat, was our guide through the countryside tour, and, in a group of about a dozen, he routinely made stops to tie information to Dutch history, geography, and contemporary life. He even quizzed the group now and then and kept the conversation going strong, so it never felt like a dry lecture on two wheels. And then he also did something you can easily take for granted: he tested the younger children to make sure they could bike safely in a protected open space before embarking on the tour, in order to ensure safe conditions for everyone--this is a great idea! Lastly, he and his Dutch assistant Rolf were happy to answer any questions or provide recommendations about what to do in Amsterdam, based on our individual interests. Having embarked on a far less successful bike tour the day before, I can say without a doubt that Joy Ride is worthy of all the good reviews it seems to be earning here."

The day before, we went on a canal tour and were very disappointed with amount of history we learned about Amsterdam. We learned so much during our bike tour, however. Adam, our tour guide was very informative. He knew so much about the Netherlands and always made sure we had time to take pictures. The tour ended up being longer than we expected, which was a plus. I was a little nervous at how much we were going to see, since all the country tour pics on here seem to be of the windmill, but it was great. We saw house boats, a farm where cheese and clogs are made, canals, and much much more. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who visits Amsterdam.Tip: Go at the beginning of your trip. They give you a list of recommended places to eat and a map of the city."

Unable to fault the tour in any way, me and my wife joined the city tour on a Friday afternoon and it was fantastic, both informative and fun, our guide was Allison who obviously has a great passion for her City and is very enthusiastic.If this is your first or fifth visit to Amsterdam i cant recommend it highly enough it gives you a great overview of the city , stopping off for Herring and a beer, perfect.I also gives you the confidence to actually hire a bike and do Amsterdam like a native! Allison also provided everyone with a list of places to eat even offering to make reservations etc.A brilliant time, a brilliant guide, do yourself a favour and just get it booked."

I had an amazing time - the bikes were immaculate and comfortable with waterproofs provided in the saddlebag should we have needed them, fortunately we didn't. Adam, our guide, was lovely, so friendly and knowledgeable, I learnt so much about the history and geography of the Netherlands- much more fun than reading a guide book! The tour took us through parks, woods, along canals and dykes and past windmills. It was easy cycling but we made a welcome 'beer' stop at a cheese and clog making farm. Joyride Tours is a small family company who do all they can to make sure you have a wonderful experience & they do -so if you visit Amsterdam, a bike tour with JOYRIDE TOURS is a must, I cannot recommend it highly enough!"

I recommend this to anyone with a few hours to spare...even to the odd Brit businessman seeking a bit of R&R (it worked for me .. i was given this as a surprise gift from my kind wife...it kept me away from window shopping!!.) . even visited a farm, bought some cheese and came away with a pair of cloggs... it must have been the Heineken !!

Neither of us had been on a bike in a while so I was just hoping we would not lag behind. Not a chance of it though. The bikes are very comfy even for those non-cyclists among us. Brought us through the park and out of the city into the countryside with stops every so often to give us information about both what we were seeing around us and also general Amsterdam history etc. The guides were very informative and knowledgable and were very willing to take questions or take pictures for us etc. I learned a lot more on this tour alone than I would have from a guide-book. They even took us to see the famous Gouda being made and also to a clog maker. Think everyone wanted some cheese after having a little taste! The only downside really was nothing to do with our tour at all. There was another tour in the gift shop (at the cheese & clog makers) and they kept skipping queues to pay for gifts so we were ages waiting to buy anything. And it was their guide telling them it was okay to skip!! Apart from this, it was a really great day and I would definitely recommend this tour. They even provide rain-wear for if the weather gets bad. Very few tours will do that!"

Our guide for the city tour was Sean (The owner and founder of Joy Ride) and our guide for the country tour was Alexandra (Sean's Aussie cousin, Joy Ride is a true family business). Both guides were very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about Amsterdam. They gave us great insight into the culture of both Amsterdam and the Netherlands, as well as showing us the sights. At the beginning of both of tours, they asked if anyone had any time constraints. Since no one had any significant constraints, they went over the original allotted time to make sure we had the best tours possible. I definitely felt like I was able to hit all the highlights of Amsterdam during the tours, and was able to relax on the remainder of the trip and just enjoy the culture without running around trying to see the area. The tours also felt very personalized, because the groups were small (10 people or less) and they did a great job of getting to know everyone and providing recommendations for restaurants and other things to do in Amsterdam. During our time in Amsterdam, we stayed with friends who live there and joined us on the country tour. They loved the tour and learned a lot about Amsterdam that they did not already know! I would highly recommend Joy Ride to anyone visiting Amsterdam!!!During our recent Europe Trip, my husband and I did bike tours in Amsterdam, Paris, and Munich, and Joy Ride was easily the best of three in all phases; best guides, best bikes, and a fun group of other rides."

Through pretty much relentless, and at times torrential rain we cycled out of the city centre into the countryside surrounding Amsterdam, but it did not dampen the enthusiasm of the small group (around 8) or that of our friendly & knowledgable guide, Allison. We did the countryside tour, which takes you through the peaceful Vondelpark, along the river Amstel, and takes in a visit to a cheese farm, a windmill, the house boats and canal locks. The majority of the tour is away from traffic, and even the route in and out of the city is on cycle paths rather than roads. Amsterdam is, of course, very flat so there are no real challenges even for novice cyclists like we are.Allison offered lots of information on our surroundings as we progressed, as well as giving plenty of advice about our stay in Amsterdam in general (such as restaurant recommendations.) This really is a great way to visit the city - you will see so much more than if you just visit the usual attractions on foot, plus you have somebody on hand to answer any questions you might have. If you can spare half a day from your time in Amsterdam, I highly recommend taking this tour. With any luck you'll have better weather than we did - but if not, wrap up and persevere, it's worth it."

Our guide, Alexandra, was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable, and we learnt a lot about everything from the history of Amsterdam to the intricate water management system of the Netherlands.

My partner and 1 were lucky to have Allison as our guide and since it coincided with the Gay parade that day, it was a small grp of just 3 of us, somewhat like a private tour. Allison was full of energy and there was never a dull moment during the 3 hr ride. The ride brought us to places in Amsterdam which we would never have seen had we stayed in the city, what a beautiful place. Totally worth the money and would highly recommend all to make some time to go for this tour."

It was so nice to be shown round the city by someone who has the same passion for her city as we do for ours. Considering we chose the worst day for biking around the city - in pouring rain - the fact that it did not dampen our enjoyment is testament enough.The tour was full of stories and anecdotes, with a personal touch. The groups are limited at 10 people, which is fantastic, you see a lot of the other tours going round with 20 or 30 people on them.A really nice touch was stopping at a Belgian Beer pub at the end of the tour where Alison took a real interest in what people were planning to do and offered individual advice to us all. She recommended a rock pub to us, The Soundgarden Cafe, which was awesome! 2 pinball tables and a cat to amuse us whilst listening to Motorhead! This goes to show she has very specific information she can give to make your holiday better.if we ever return, we'll do the Countryside tour for sure. Thanks Alison."

I wholeheartedly agree with the majority of posts that it is a very lovely ride, with a very friendly tour guide. We traveled with 3 kids, (10, 8 and 4). We were nervous riding with the toddler, since Amsterdam does not have the typical US style bike trailer, but a \"bakfiets bike\". The online photos of the bike are quite unlike kids bikes in the US. That being said, my son LOVED it. He asked us to \"buy him one\"of course...(and no, we did not). My other 2 children enjoyed the ride immensely and despite the 4 hour tour, wanted to continue riding (shocking!). We did the countryside tour which included the clog, cheese and farm tour. It was charming. We had time to stop and take photos, and we learned so much about the canals, the pulley systems, the windmills etc. Allison was a great guide with lots of information. She was patient with our kids, and she was a delight with my little son.My only comment is, we had a 45 minute + mis-start since we had to rent our own bakfiets bike, and there was confusion re: which store the rental was booked. This did cause \"overtime\" on the back end of the tour. (Overtime charges are clearly stated on the website). It was only partially charged (which was very kind) but, at the same time, if the bakfiets bike had been rentable from Joy tours directly, we would not have been late. Perhaps your company could facilitate this process for future customers, to avoid delays and make the tour more seamless. Since travelling with really young kids is already so challenging, anything your company could do to make it easier probably would be appreciated by future families.It was such a delightful day, that I did not mention it to her at the time. The tour says a 6 or 7? euro credit will be given if you rent the bike elsewhere. We rented the bakfiets bike elsewhere and the credit was given for 1 rider, but my little son didn't ride a bike and yet we were still charged full price for him. (For a toddler, really? The US rarely charges the same price for children and adults for anything...) If he were an additional adult rider with his own bike, the policy suggests he would have been discounted. It is really minor detail, and I probably should have brought it up then, but with the rain, and the kids I decided not to. Overall a great tour ride and I would highly recommend it despite the minor issues."

The bikes were in very good condition and the overall ride was relatively flat. What makes this tour worthwhile is that Joy Ride keeps the tour groups quite small (no more than 10 people for the city tour with no exceptions).

This was done based on the reviews on tripadvisor and yes all the very positive reviews are well deserved. We mistakenly turned up for the city tour on Sunday afternoon but Allison quickly spotted the problem and very promptly suggested that we go to the Van Gogh museum(also booked) and turn up on Monday morning for the tour that we were supposed to go on. Could not have been more accommodating or more helpful. Very professional yet very friendly. Now to the actual tour. Alex (cousin of the owners) took 7 very diverse people on a very enjoyable and informative tour. Knowledgeable and easy to listen to. We were so fortuntate to have lovely weather but still think that even if the the sun had not being shining it would still have been a good experience. If you have not been on a bike for years the countryside tour is so well geared and thought out I have no hesitation recommending it to families, teenagers, young adults and the not so young adults like myself. Enjoyed my second visit to Amsterdam but my time with Joy Ride Day Tours was definitely the highlight of this visit. Glad I did not miss it even though it would have been my own fault!"

He was very flexible in adjusting the tour to the questions raised by the bikers. The ride through the city lasted more than three hours and ended in a bar. We will certainly do the tour again."

            "review": "Joy Ride is a great way to experience the city and countryside of Amsterdam. I had only two days in Amsterdam. I was lucky to walk up on the afternoon city tour which is limited to ten people (you should reserve online to ensure your place)- a nice size tour with Allison. The tour covers all the main parts of the city and was fun and informative - you would need multiple walking tours to do the different parts of the city that we saw on one tour. Allison loves what she does.  I signed up for the morning country tour the next day. The countryside tour was a wonderful overview into different parts of Amsterdam not far from the city center. It is very different from the city tour - it is so relaxing especially without the traffic as you ride through the park, neighborhoods, trails and along the water. It is also a limited small group no more than 15 riders with mostly flat roads. It was fun when we were given food to feed the ducks? - I realized that that was a necessity as they block the road we need to ride on - once they moved for the food we could then ride though. The cheesemaker/clog visit was fun as the farmer was so entertaining and the prices reasonable although no credit cards -cash only. The bikes are very easy to ride and quite comfortable which was good as I haven't been on a bike in years. The regular bikes have a side bag for your personal items such as purses, camera, bottled water, snack, etc. These two tours are a great way to experience Amsterdam -"

The team is absolutely AMAZING, they tell you lots of information about the Netherlands and their main concern is your safety and to make sure that you are enjoying every minute. Alex from Joy Ride Tours also suggested a great Indonesian Restaurant near Leidsplein called Saba Sebo which was really gooood. You have to ask her about the Heineken story.Absolutely worth trying!"

My best friend & I went to Amsterdam with our daughters (4 & 7 years old) and, based on the reviews, I signed us up for a private tour with Joy Ride. We were quite concerned about our ability to bike all day with our daughters (box bike too cumbersome, one of us had to rent a tandem & the other a normal bike with child seat) and we almost cancelled due to these concerns. However, we are SO GLAD we went ahead with it because the country tour with Allison was the best part of our amazing trip to Amsterdam! Allison is great, super friendly & mellow, and she adapts the tour to your needs/your kids. We fed geese, gave milk to baby goats, saw an interesting residential houseboat area, rode through a forest & had lunch at the farm. We are in ok not great shape, and yet this was easy (flat holland). Of course, there was also the obligatory windwill. We really loved the tour, the girls had fun, and it was a great day. Thanks so much to Joy Ride & definitely anyone thinking about this tour should book immediately!!"

Your recommendation for an Italian dinner was fabulous - thank you for making a reservation for us - the food was superb!

While I think riding a bike in Amsterdam is a must, it isn't a must for the tour. He was only able to stop every 20 minutes or so and then he'd lecture for a good 15 minutes straight. Plus, you couldn't ask questions while riding really, because you were paying attention. Further, after riding a bit and stopping he'd say things like, \"Did you see {blank}?\" and most people would be like... uhm, no, we didn't realize there was a specific thing we were looking for. It would have been nice to get warning about important things to look for. I say skip the bike tour and go with a walking tour for more information and a better stroll around the City. He was very friendly and knowledgeable, but the style of the tour wasn't great."

I was in Amsterdam in September over a week-end in between business meetings. Based on the reviews for Joy Ride Day Tours, I decided to book the country tour. Sean was a great guide - had lots of interesting information and stories for us and he clearly enjoys taking groups out. Our trip lasted 4 hours but the pace was leisurely (no hills!) and we saw a wide variety of landscape. After watching the Dutch riding their bikes around the city, I was thrilled to be experiencing the bike paths myself. One note - the cheese farm just provides a small tasting of cheese, so I would recommend packing power bars and water for the trip. Fortunately it was cool, but I didn't have either water or food with me and wished I had."

Sean stopped often to share information and facilitate picture taking. We visited a windmill (fascinating story about windmills) and a farm where we learned about cheese, wooden shoes and had an opportunity to shop in their little store. One caution...Amsterdam is a high traffic area for bikes so be careful, look both ways and stay in the line."

The city bikes are made by the Dutch manufacturer, Gazelle; all comfort and smoothness and upright sightseeing. We chose this particular tour as we wanted to get away from the city centre hustle and bustle, and it was definitely the right choice.Our 20km cycle tour took us through meandering countyside roads and paths, serene suburbs and sprawling farmland. We got to see a different side to this lovely city which we've visited many times before, and will not hesitate to book another tour with Joy Ride next time (the coffee shop tour, perhaps!)."

It goes to some really lovely spots and Allison is a great guide - funny, patient knowledgable and really nice. 20km may sound like a long ride and I suppose it is for some folks, but for us the time flew by. It rained a fair bit during our ride but Allison provided lightweight rain gear and it really didn't become bothersome, especially as Allison improvised a slightly drier tree-lined finish at the end when the rain became more than the light drizzle it had been.There were some great stops along the way in just the right amount. Stopping to feed an army of geese who've been spoiled (and fattened) by Aliison's rides was a definite highlight. My partner and I had considered renting bikes for our whole trip, but once we saw Amsterdam's somewhat chaotic traffic flow, we decided against it. It's true that Amsterdam is quite walkable, but some of the walks are very long. If we were to do it again, we'd acclimate ourselves to riding with the Joy Ride city tour at the start of the trip and rent bikes for the rest. Biking is the way to go and a tour seems to me the best way to get started."

We booked the Country tour online as I had read on here it gets very popular and I had previusly done a city tour with another company on a previous visit. We met at the designated point then went to collect our bikes, the bikes are quite heavy and I found a little difficult to handle. We didn't really have a chance to get used ot the bike, we were told to choose our bike, make any adjustments and then we were off!The tour is fantastic as it takes you to places that, as a tourist you would probably never see or think to go and see, or probably never find! Sean was our guide for thetour and we were lucky to have great weather, we stopped to see a windmill and visited a cheese and clog farm, I enjoyed this as it was great to see how both are made, although the owner seems very eccentric and loved the petite women who were on our tour!I have a couple of negatives about the tour though, firstly the bikes have gears - we were told about these as we were riding off, so I think a quick 1 minute chat about these could have helped so you weren't trying to get your balance, navigate across to the park and figure out your gears all at once!Secondly the tour was supposed to be 10km, ours turned out to be 20km, yes it was lovely to see more but it was a lot and gosh did I ache on the evening and next day! This actually spoilt the tour a bit as by the end I couldn't wait for it to finish! So if you book this tour be prepared for it to be longer than expected or if you have health issues then check if it is going to be extended.Thirdly, it would have been lovely to take pictures of some of the places along the route, yes we had designated stop points but there were some lovely places I missed out on taking photos of as I wasn't confident enough to try and take a picture whilst cycling along and I dodn't want to stop and posibly lose the rest of the group.Overall the trip was amazing and I would recommend it, we saw so much and even with our aching legs (and we are quite active) we really enjoyed the experience and know we would never have seen so much if we had tried to venture out to the country on our own."

In addition to his obvious knowledge, he was entertaining and was able to interact with all of us rather than just going through a scripted explanation of what we were being shown in different parts of the city. He said from the outset the tour would take 2-3 hours, depending on the amount of questions we had, which I thought was excellent. I would recommend this to anyone who can ride a bike! Thanks again, Sean!"

We rhode our bikes in the country side and got to see many cool things that you definitelly don't see in the city. This was one of the best tours we took while visiting Amsterdam. I would definitelly do it again, and definitelly recommend it to anyone.Thanks!"

            "review": "city tour - recommended, especially as initial orientation to Amsterdam. Allison couldn\u2019t have been a nicer guide on the City tour. Some of the nicer elements of the bike tour were the personal stories Allison offered along the way, mixed with humor and the history of the city, her offering of herring to bike riders, and the stop at the brewery on the return trip. I found the history information, particularly around the Anne Frank house, to be very interesting, and I found myself wanting to learn more about WWII era in Amsterdam because of her comments. I bike very regularly and had been to Amsterdam once so was already generally oriented to the city. With that background, I found myself wishing the tour had been a little longer in length, with more stops, and with even more information. For example, the tour didn\u2019t go into Vondel Park, one of my very favorite areas of the city, even though it was close to the starting point; there were also missed opportunities for discussion of artists (e.g., van Gogh) even though the meeting point for the tour was the Museumplein, and we could easily stopped there on the way back. I also believe I may be spoiled by my only other experience with bike tours in Europe, Fat Tire\u2019s bike tours in Paris, which set a standard so high that it may be difficult to compare. Nonetheless, I think the City tour may actually be a perfect first introduction to the city, and the guides are extremely nice hosts. Amsterdam is a beautiful city, and biking is the only way to see it."

We had the luxury of perfect sunshine on our Country tour which made the tour even more enjoyable. Allison was very friendly and very accommodating as well as very knowledgeable with the history of Amsterdam. We felt safe the whole time and the ride itself was very relaxing and not very hard at all. If you are a regular bike rider this is a walk in the park - however if you have not ridden a bike before or have serious health problems, maybe this is not for you. The bikes themselves were very easy to ride and of high quality - some had saddle bags to put gear into if you needed.Our group only had 10 people which made it a lot easier to ask questions; and there were plenty of opportunities to stop and take photos. The stop at the Cheese Farm was fun and had really tasty cheese that was relatively cheap. All in all a great tour - a good mix of fun, history, quirky facts, fun characters and exercise. Don't think twice about booking this tour - just do it!"

After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, we booked the City Tour on our first day in Amsterdam and the Countryside Tour for the following day. Allison was our guide for both tours and we couldn't have been more pleased. She's incredibly knowledgeable about Amsterdam and the surrounding areas and enthusiastically shares her favorite haunts, restaurants, bars and stores. Her city tour was the perfect start to our time in Amsterdam, giving us an quick overview of the different areas of the city and its history. She treated us to \"Dutch Sushi\", herring with onions and pickles\u2013which is surprisingly delicious, and the tour ended sampling brews at a bar in a windmill. But as much fun as the City Tour was, we enjoyed the Countryside one even more. The pace was a tad more relaxed, and the areas we rode through were simply gorgeous. Again, Allison's expert knowledge of the culture and history enhanced the experience. On other bike tours we've taken, the groups have been very large and it was hard keep up and hear the guide, but on both these tours there was only one other couple, making it much more enjoyable. We had considered renting bikes and tackling the city on our own, but there is no way we would have seen as much or had as much fun. We were in Amsterdam for a week, and did several other tours as well, but the Joy Bike Tours was by far our favorite. Thanks Allison!"

I knew nothing about Amsterdam but now that I know about the history and culture everything else I'm seeing and doing makes more sense. Plus now when people ask me about my trip I have something more interesting to say than \"the canals were pretty\". I'd highly recommend taking this tour, it's the best money I've spent here. And even better would be to do it at the start of your trip to get familiar with the lay of the land but even if you can't---just do it. You won't regret it. As far as biking in Amsterdam, I wobbled on the bike a bit (ok more than a bit) but Sean gave me some pointers and it was fine (I didn't mow down any other bikers!)."

After having somewhat a disheartening experience on another bike tour in another country, I must admit I was not looking forward to this tour completely, nor was my husband (as I'm sure he was worried about how I would fare...) However, the reviews are all 100% true to their form, this is by far one of the best tours we went on throughout Europe. Sean was our guide and he was amazing. His knowledge of European history, specifically Amsterdam, was astounding. The bikes were comfortable, they had a few different sizes and he was willing to adjust the seat height to make the bike easy to ride for females (a trouble I had with another bike tour). Amsterdam is a fantastic city to ride around in, I'm not a biker, and I felt incredibly comfortable and competent on my bike. The tour was a good pace, the guide really caters the tour to what you want to see and what you want to learn about. We went to quite a few historical sites, a brewery in a Windmill, through the Red Light District, one of the Queens palaces, etc. He pointed out great places to hang out with locals, eateries, breweries, etc. I would recommend this tour to everyone, it was the perfect way to start out sightseeing in Amsterdam. The reviews don't lie! Thank you, Sean and Joy Ride Tours for such a great cultural experience throughout Amsterdam!"

Then we took our bikes on a boat over to the north where we road along the river. We passed through several little quaint towns, then the towns stopped, and we road along a huge river with lots of ships. We road to a village that used to be an island, but 30 years ago was connected to the mainland. Until recently it survived off of fishing, but tourism seemed to be the dominate industry when we visited. The houses were all wood and many of the people still dressed in traditional cloths. My wife and I dressed in traditional clothes and had our pictures taken, At the time I was not too enthousiatic about the idea, but looking at the photo now I realize it is one of my favorite souvenirs from our whole European trip.The ride was great, the guide funny, and informative. My only complaint was the wind was in our face the whole ride back. It is a long ride to Marken, but the way back was twice as long with the wind in our face. Thank god they had nice bikes.

I wanted to get on a bike but not just by myself so I decided to take a tour. I found these guys by speaking to the receptionist at my hotel, Hotel Freeland, and they suggested I give them a try. I'm so glad I did. The meeting point was in walking distance to the hotel and the experience was just what I was after. Though he is not Dutch, Sean loves this city and it shows. If you want a different view of Amsterdam while you are in town I can highly recommend Joy Ride."

            "review": "Locals love it too!. As a long time resident of Amsterdam I thought I knew my town inside and out. What a surprise it was to take A\u2019dam bike tour with Joy Ride Tours this weekend with my out of town Guest! Our guide Sean knew great stories about Amsterdam that even I haven\u2019t heard before and managed to make this old town seem fresh and new again. He was extremely patient with my friend\u2014she hadn\u2019t ridden a bike in ages\u2014and made sure she felt totally at ease picking her ride and starting out\u2026In no time she was riding like a local and I\u2019ve had her on a bike the rest of her trip\u2014thanks Sean! I loved that we stopped for a quick Jenever and I was able to have a chat with the other riders too. It turns out I wasn\u2019t the only local in the group, and Sean managed to impress us both with his quirky insiders knowledge of our town. I\u2019ll definitely be checking out their country tour too!"

            "review": "Perfect Joy. Every time I visit Amsterdam I'm so jealous of all the people riding on bikes. This time I tried it myself, and had a wonderful time with Joy Ride Day Tours. They have bikes to fit every size person. I'm short and haven't ridden a bike in years, but Shawn took the time to fit me for the right bike. He gave a short orientation on bike riding rules and safety and we were off. I felt confident from the beginning of the ride. The bikes are in excellent condition, and Shawn matched the pace to our tour group. We stopped at many less known sights and bicycled out into the country. Shawn gave us the story behind all the places we saw, and answered all our questions. I can recommend Joy Ride Day Tours for people of all ages. It was a perfect time in a wonderful city."

            "review": "The best way to see the city and country in one morning. After watching everyone zooming around the city on bikes, I decided to take a tour; it is an eye opening experience. I took a countryside tour with Sean, and was shocked to see how close the countryside is to the heart of the city. Less than 30 minutes of riding (along very well-defined bike trails) and we were in the countryside; it really made me appreciate the Dutch way organizing their city.The bikes worked well (handbrakes are appreciated), the tour covered everything from leaning townhouses to beautiful rural vistas, the group was not too big, and the weather was perfect; I had a lot of fun. The owner (Sean) is definitely a character"

            "review": "My kids loved it, I loved it. Will do again.. I had been to Amsterdam about 20 times before I took the day trip with Sean of Joy Ride Tours, but during this day trip I got to know more of this wonderul city then in those 20 times before. I liked it so much that I came back a couple of days later and took with Joy Ride outside Amsterdam. It was perfect, the cheese farm, the wind mills, the stories we heard.. these guides know what they do, know how to treat us customers, and - in my case more important now - know how to treat customers' kids. My kids loved it. I was a bit worried that we will all be terribly tired, but no... since Sean makes all these stops, with snacks and fresh drinks. Kids want to do it again. So do I."
