Seating is plentiful and seats i.e. view is fabulous. Meydan Hotel next door is great for drinks and appetizers and one can view the race from the balcony. Prices are high for instance an expresso is AED 25, beer is AED 48. Shisha available too. Service is fantastic."

The feeling you get standing there overlooking those magnificent beasts run, gives you a feeling of complete elevation. The facalities at Meydan can be compared to that of the rest of Dubai: unprecedented. Treat yourself, have a look at their private party packages and go enjoy something very special and in any other part of the world probably more exclusive, making the Meydan a uniquely inviting experience."

Yet....other than World Cup night, it leaves much to be desired in terms of atmosphere. I attended Super Saturday and it was a crying shame that arriving with no organised plan, my colleague and I were sold a very expensive hospitality package into a VIP enclosure that easily catered for over 150 people and yet had an entire total number of 2 for half the race meeting, when we were then joined by another 8. The racing was superb, the prize money on offer incredible, the quality of horses on display world class - yet the atmosphere was flatter than a midweek meeting at the Vaal in South Africa or some resolute English country side course.So much potential and yet so little delivery in terms of customer experience.I will go again - for the horses and for World Cup night - but will have to do some serious research into where I land up, if I am to go on any other night other than the big one."

Everyone is so friendly and staff always recommending places to visit and make reservations if you don't have anything planned. On arrival we were given a welcome drink and a wet towel to cool down (which you will need). Everything is so extravagant from huge velvet chairs to massive chandeliers. There were hidden doors in your hotel room to store luggage and there are door bells rather than people knocking. The rooms were very modern with touch pads everywhere for lights and curtains in the bathroom. There was a tv (we think) in the bathroom above a huge bath but we were not sure how to work this. There was also a separate shower which was amazing. When we stayed it was not very busy and all of the staff remembered our names when we were walking around the hotel. We went in the pool on the roof which was an infinity pool with amazing views. Towels are provided and the waiter also handed out fruit while you were up there.We ate in the steak restaurant one evening and everything was delicious, we would definitely recommend.As we were on our honeymoon we had a lovely cake left for us in our room on arrival and also one presented in the steak restaurant for desert which was very nice. There are always taxi's outside and if you want one, the door man will pull one over for you.The hotel is slightly out of the way from the centre where all of the action is but it does not take long to get into the town and not that expensive.We really enjoyed our stay here any only have positive things to feed back. We would love to come again when the racing is on."

We've never been to a horse race, and did not know if we liked it, but truly enjoyed ourselves. We only got the cheapest tickets (50dhs), but were a bit disappointed by the dining options that came along with it. Everybody can roam around freely in the whole area, but you are only allowed to access the restaurants dedicated to the ticket class you bought. Accordingly, we were stuck with the likes of Pizza Hut, which was not worth the occasion, but our bad. Next time I'd go for more expensive tickets to get the full experience, but if you don't plan to eat or drink there you might as well be fine with the general access."

Ascot was once a bit special, and maybe still is, but now perhaps only in the Royal Enclosure, the rest has sorted of descended into a rather large jolly up. Nothing wrong with that maybe and if it's for you, then great. The Meydan has the feel for me that Ascot did twenty years ago, and the weather is a lot more reliable. So it is well worth timing a visit to Dubai to take in the races, if you want to dress up and have some civilised fun watching the gg's. the Champagne is in abundance, as are the ladies in their hats. The tote may be absent, but in the age of smartphones and online gaming you won't be deprived of a flutter, just the feel of cash in your hands and the queue to get on before the start. Not sure I'll miss either here, as for me the cash only seemed to go one way at Ascot."

The Gallery area was not crowded and seats are not assigned so there is ample opportunity to sit in different locations as well as access to the rail for closer viewing. The Gallery package also allows entrance to the Parade and Apron areas. We enjoyed the food buffet and drinks as part of the Gallery ticket package. The buffet and dining tables are indoors, easily accessed and well laid out. I didn't feel rushed and crowded as is the atmosphere at the Kentucky Derby. We had a wonderful day at Meydan which was perfected by a CA Chrome win. Beautiful fireworks after the race and Janet Jackson performed in the Apron area after the fireworks.

Good choice of food and drinks. Indoor restaurant area. Lots of races to watch, amazing fireworks and concert for closing ceremony. Definetely need to do this at least once."

The setting of the hotel is wonderful surrounded by well manicured gardens and the race course looks amazing. We stayed in a room on the 8th floor which was huge, tastefully decorated and immaculate. Our room (looks like most if not all of the rooms) had a balcony which overlooked the racecourse. It was great to see the horses being trained first thing in the morning.Breakfast was a typical buffet style with continental breakfast and cooked breakfast being offered everyday served in Farriers Restaurant. Tables were offered inside and outside with views over the racecourse. We found eating earlier was better as the restaurant was better as the restaurant got quite busy and tables weren't always as clean as they could have been. A couple of times we asked for coffees which didn't arrive although we didn't chase them either. When you arrive for breakfast you are shown to a table which is great but then relies on the staff chasing you, sometimes as you leave to get your room number. The process could be streamlined so easily if you had to give your room number before being seated.The pool area was lovely located on the top of the hotel with views over the racecourse and out to the City. We found it to be really peaceful and quiet with staff to bring out towels and a drinks service too. Prices were about what we'd expected with alcoholic cocktails c. \u00a39 and Non-alcoholic cocktails about \u00a36.The hotel is a 20-30 minute drive away from the City and there is a shuttle provided although we used taxis. Taxis were readily available from the front of the hotel and ranged from \u00a312-\u00a318, averaging around \u00a315.Room service was very tasty, reasonably priced with quick service. We ate in Shiba which was serving Chinese and Japanese food the night we went. Again, the service was excellent and the food was very good although we did think \u00a390 for two starters, two mains, one side and two cocktails was a bit pricey. We had an amazing five nights at the Meydan and would recommend this hotel. Although out of the city centre the hotel was peaceful with great views of the Dubai city skyline. Would have been a 5 star review but for the haphazard breakfast process."

Whilst the horses racing is the richest prize money in the world, the grandstand and the atrium incredibly impressinve the rest is of a very poor standard, unkesss you are lucky enough to be a guest in a private suite . The public equivalent to the Royal Enclosure is sadly lacking. Buffet food to be eaten off very flimsy plastic plates, plastic cutlery and glasses. No allocated seating in the premium area restaurant which was the standard of a rather lower class cafeteria. No screens to watch the action on the racecourse and no windows. Allocated seating was the only plus. The dress code is certainly not adhered to.There is little or no atmosphere in the grand stand due to no betting which is sort of understandable.A bitter disappointment all round. We are lucky enough to be members of British racecourses where the hospitality and service is terrific, despite the weather.I would strongly recommend saving your money and not going as is an expensive evening for not a lot."

I have to tell you this is one amazing Racecourse!!!. It was a nightmare getting into it as we took a taxi and then had to drove around loops for ages and then got dropped off in open spaces to take a bus into the place. Anyway after that we had to get scanned like in airports except shoes belts everything came off. Security was tight.Once we got into the Apron Views Area which is where we bought out tickets for ( great value at $170AUD) and where all expats go. The track was amazing, the grandstand just out of this world. To watch some of the richest horse races in the world at this place was definitely one thing to do, would love to come here again. Bring plenty of money as the drinks and food are pricey compared to prices in Australia."

The large screens can easily be seen. We went twice and the service was better the first time than the second. However, the food was very good and the staff were very pleasant. The only negatives were the air con was too high and it got very cold inside, the second problem to watch out for is the pillars. The two times they tried to put us behind pillars, but they did respond to my wife's complaints and found better tables. The only other thing to be aware of is the glass panels above the first tier can block your vision, so ask for a table on the lower tier. The dinner ticket does allow you to go to the parade ring also and if you ask the waiter will show you the way."

We pre booked our evening at the races prior to flying out for our holiday in Dubai very easily on the Meydan website.We booked in the Winners circle restaurant for an inclusive package of food and drink.First race was at 7pm and drinks were served from 6.30pm Word of warning a 20 min taxi ride at this time of night takes over an hour so we were a little bit rushed but our fault!Shown to our table excellent view wall to ceiling glass over the winners circle (obviously!!) and the winning post you cannot fail to be impressed the champagne arrived and then we relaxed and started to enjoy the evening. We were served by a young man named 'Robin' from India who was studying hospitality and doing his placement at the Meydan Winners circle Restaurant, he was an amazing young man who will go far in his chosen career I hope they recognise this at the Meydan and give him a job!!The food choice, wine and drinks package was of a very high standard and for anybody that likes the races this is an experience not to be missed.The icing on the cake was seeing Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid and his entourage (there was plenty of them) enjoying the races and the horses from the Godolphin stables.We loved Dubai and this was our favourite evening out, if you get the chance you wont be disappointed."

There\u2019s a free section as well, which looked like a lot of fun (but is not by the finish line). Beer and wine is not available in the free section, but is for sale in the other sections.The best part was the atmosphere. Although it looks all glitzy, it\u2019s really friendly, like a small-town racetrack. For example, when a young girl asked one of the winning jockeys for a souvenir, he smiled and tossed her his goggles.Also, are great views of the Dubai skyline from the desert side.Would totally recommend this for both visitors and residents."

The guide has been in horse racing most of his life and in the UAE since the early 90s, a veritable walking history book of Dubai racing and breeding. While in the stables guests can interact with horses, in addition to seeing them fed, washed, shod, run, and taken for a swim. The grandstand tour started to get a bit tedious as it was obviously part marketing, selling box and restaurant reservations. Otherwise, great value for money. Go do it."

Its was a large restaurant but all the tables are banked so that no matter where you sit the views are completely unimpeded. You pay a fixed price for four courses but you could choose your starters and main courses and the price also includes all drinks (which included spirits and several choices of white, red & rose wine).In my experience, when catering for large numbers the food tends not to be the best but I was happily proved wrong as our meal was excellent and served very hot.Your ticket also allows you to wander down to the parade ring and access most of the outdoor areas and its well worthwhile popping down to soak up the atmosphere for at least one race as well as to take in the sheer size of the grandstand which is just huge.We saw six races and whilst it's slightly odd (for us anyway !) that you are unable to gamble we had a fantastic evening and hope to return one day."

You can get up close to the horses for a pet which is wonderful. It would have been nice, however, to learn a bit more about them, which bloodlines they come from, their race history etc. I would say, more time should have been spent in this part to learn all of this.After that, you get taken to the racecourse and you can go onto the turf and visit the jockey's room and see the facilities there. You also get shown the restaurants and facilities indoor for if you were to visit a race (perhaps a little too much time spent doing this part).All in all a thoroughly enjoyable visit, more information on the horses (as well as time spent) from the tour guide would have been nice."

Ok, enough about parking. The place is huge and beautiful. Lots of security. Lots of people trying to get into places they aren't allowed haha, we saw several women doing what is equivalent to \"sweet talking their way backstage\", but to security's credit, they held their own. Food was great, we were high up so had a wonderful view. The crowd was strange, many expats who didn't even care where they were, seemed that they didn't even know there was a horserace going on (but who can blame them, those big hats can be distracting)."

We had seats outside, near the presentation area and right at the track. We was a fun few hours watching the races and making our private wagers on who would win in each race. There was also drinks and food available, just inside, with some delicious choices. The downsides:Although you could bring your drinks outside and they would serve you drinks outside, you could not eat outside. So if you wanted to eat, you had to go inside and stay in. They had screens up so you could still watch the race, but it would have been nice to have had the option of eating outside too.When we arrived there was a cue at the main entrance and one of the guards waved us through another entrance. This was great and we quickly went to our seating area which was quite far away from the main entrance. This was a mistake.....Although gambling is not permitted in the UAE, you could make predictions on which horses would win and if your predictions were correct, then you could win money. However, we got all the way to our seating area to find out that you had to pick these prediction forms at the main entrance. They did not have any available with the person you submitted the forms to in our section. We did not realise this (the guards who waved us through never said) and we had no time to go all the way back to the main entrance to get some. This did not detract from the fun time we had, but it was a little annoying as we were looking forward to making our predictions on the races.Anyway, a day at the races is good thing to try. They also have an Ascot type affair there each year, so that would be another fun event to attend at Meydan Racecourse."

            "review": "An experience to be done at least once. As expected the Dubai Gold Cup experience is truly spectacular from the build up to the races through to the fireworks and celebrity guest appearance; this year Kylie Minogue. We really enjoyed ourselves and a great place to people watch but probably the biggest surprise we had not anticipated was quite how boring it would be; I imagine on a second visit you'd struggle to keep enthralled. The racing starts a little later in the afternoon and goes on into the evening, followed by fireworks and music/dancing. One thing we had not considered till we got there, which is stupid really, as we've been to Dubai loads of times, is there is no gambling so no putting on bets for the races. Now having been to major races both in England and Ireland, half of the excitement is running in between races to put some small token bet on the next race then running back to your seats or walking round to look at the horses - we've had great fun with our 8 year old, who always picks the 'prettiest' one with the nicest mane braid. It's just a bit of family fun, not serious and we always walk away a few quid down but that's half the fun and keeps you interested. Here you don't really get up in between races other than refreshments so the afternoon can really drag on a bit with not a lot to look forward to other than people watching (the event oozes wealth!) the fireworks and show at the end. So if you have never done it, by all means it's a once in a lifetime day/evening out, but if you love the atmosphere at the Curragh and racing to see the horses, the jockeys and quickly putting a small bet on then you might be a little disappointed."

Usually it's the Race Time, so you will be able to see great horse race, enjoy a great day with friends and drinks outside, see one of the best fireworks in the world as well as dance till the early hours and watch the performance of some big star such as Jennifer Lopez, Kylie Minogue. There is someone new every year. Don't forget to book your tickets in advance as well as decide what you gonna wear. Gentlemen usually wear a tux, a black suit and even a top hat, while ladies dress-code is an elegant dress and a piece of art head piece. Attention: The best dressed couple wins a valuable prize, while the best-dressed female with stunning hair-do and a head piece has a chance to win a luxury car, such as Jaguar, for example. Get ready and go for it!:)"

It was made all the special by having friends Eclipse award winning trainer Jeff Bonde and California Chrome along with his trainer Art Sherman there as well.The facility must be seen to be believed. Approximately 11 stories with a hotel and an infinity pool on the top level...breathtaking. The opulent luxuries ooze from every corner. There were 80,000 people, not a single racing form, not a single ticket, no one handicapping or engrossed in trying to figure out their next wager as there was no wagering of any sort. It was like the twilight zone. Even web sites linked to online gambling were blocked. The merciful Sheik simply builds a racing palace, and puts up $30,000,000 in purses while inviting the world's best horses to compete against his best horses with all expenses paid. Bizare. When you venture inside the magnificantly appointed grand stands you are greeted by an open bar, a lavish buffet and a music group playing on a stage near by. They don't even pipe the call of the race inside. The races are more of a carnival than a handicapping challenge to be conquered. In an era of fiscal austerity and closing decaying facilities it was in disbelief that I glanced off to the distance and so the prestine grounds of the former race track, a exact duplicate of Churchhill downs abandoned yet meticulously maintained.Amid the world's tallest building, the world's only 7 star hotel and the ability to ride a camel across a nearby set of dunes, Meydan Racecourse stands out as another must do experience...particularly when they are racing."

Everyone has heard of the Dubai Gold Cup horse race, but forget all the bling of that day out, an evening at Meydan is a fantastic way to spend a few hours in Dubai doing something different. The entry is very affordable, and once track side you have a seat and a full view of the course. You can get food and drink (including wine and beer) and can even walk up to the track itself to get close to the horses. Highly recommend for an alternative night out during racing season. Note it's casual - jeans and sweaters, boots or flat shoes."

I personally will not contribute my earnings to horse racing. However the grandness of this building, is quite impressive. The inside of the building feels like you stepped into something grand and chic, and the views at night across the course are quite peaceful. There is a stillness out there. The food at the smorgasboard restaurant (sorry cannot remember the name) was okay. Just that, the price was fantastic, and the view was great. The array of options was not vast. This place feels a little bit further out from Dubai. Which is nice sometimes. :)"

All made better by several winners.The food court sold one of the best pizzas I've had and Kylie finished off the event after some awesome fireworks All in all a very impressive place, well organised, clean and the building itself IMPRESSIVE."

It starts with a buffet breakfast at the Meydan Hotel - which was very good. Then you enter a bus and they take you to various parts of the racetrack/stables. We were able to see/touch many of the horses and get pictures with them.  We met the farrier and learned quite a bit from him. He was very gracious and answered all our questions (Sorry, I did not get his name. Was it Alan???). He was really quite knowledgeable and was quite easy to speak with. He even gave us an old horseshoe as a souvenir.  We also got to see the equine 'swimming pool'....the jockeys' dressing room....some real saddles/boots.... the winner's circle...and a trip to the huge bubble observation deck (that's probably not the official name). Here you have great views of the Dubai skyline. A bottle of water is provided for you as it does get warm. The final stop was the exhibition where there was a movie....some information about horse racing and Dubai. The Dubai World Cup trophy was there and we were then allowed to dress up in hats and get our picture taken with it. Each person got a copy of the photo (even if you were in a group photo) and it was free. There were also some jockey outfits there that you could dress in. A lot of fun. They provided you with a bag of goodies upon completion of the tour. This included a race booklet, magazine, and baseball cap with DUBAI on it. There is a visit to the souvenir store in case you were interested in purchasing anything (mugs were a great price at only 15 AED each). The guides were superb. Mark was a great guide - never rushing, provided lots of information, very easy going. He was accompanied by Jessie (a former jockey with tons of information) and Brian (who guided us through every step). Kudos to that team. Bring a camera and maybe some water. To get to the tour, you must drive or take a taxi. Follow the signs for the HOTEL....valet parking is free.  I live in Dubai and I have to say that I enjoyed it immensely even though I don't follow horse racing. I would highly recommend this for either tourists or residents. As the title says - it's absolutely worth it!!"

I have been to courses in many parts of Australia, Asia, US and UK and this is a great course. We had a dining table booked right on the window of a magnificent stand about 120 metres from the winning post. The food was very good (4 courses), there was a free flow champagne, wine and beer package and even though it is illegal to gamble, if you have a phone and an account with a corporate bookie, i don't think you would have any problems getting on. Package was about US$120. If the place had one drawback it did not have alot of atmosphere due to the size of the place and there are no punters cheering home a winner."

For a city that strives to be the biggest and best in the world, this racetrack is right on par. As if the sheer size and beauty isn't enough, they also make it an extravagant experience as well.I spent three days at Meydan, leading up to the Dubai World Cup. The first day featured Breakfast with the Stars during morning workouts. The tents and tables were set with beautiful decorations. The food was plentiful, delicious, and offered a great variety. The juices were very fresh and tasted spectacular. There was live music and interviews with jockeys, trainers, owners, etc. Indoors, there was a great display of all the past World Cup winning horses.After breakfast, we walked toward the Meydan hotel to go to the Meydan museum. It was small, but high quality. It's free, but they ask you to \"register\" by typing your email address on an iPad. The museum starts with a short video about Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and his vision to promote horse racing in Dubai, and his ascent from beginning Godolphin to adding Darley, growing Dubai, to the present day glory of the Dubai World Cup. Most of the museum exhibit is a timeline of events, but there are a few artifacts, and we did get to see the trophy that would be presented to the owner of the winning horse of the World Cup. You get a personal guide who accompanies you through the museum. I think some guides are better than others. Ours stood silently next to us, and made me feel awkward, while others were actively explaining things to their guests. The highlight of the museum is the lifelike recreation of Dubai Millenium, Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin horse who won the World Cup in 2000. There was amazing attention to detail in making that statue a perfect recreation of that horse at exactly the moment that he crossed the wire in the World Cup. At the end, you get your picture taken with the horse, and you get the picture, a hat, and a pen in a neat Dubai bag for free.The next day we went to the track for morning workouts which started peacefully under the lights, featuring the highest quality horses from throughout the world. Then we were treated to a brilliant desert sunrise before workouts wrapped up.World Cup day was as epic as you would expect. The races themselves were larger than life, and there was always something to keep you entertained. The evening culminated in a celebration of the United Arab Emirates honoring the guests who visited from throughout the world. There were musical performances, dancing, and the most amazing fireworks display anyone has ever seen.Meydan truly is an unbelievable place. Every race fan should make it their goal to visit once in their lifetime."

Go through turn right for 40 yards to another entry point. Loads of room and same food, only no queues. The fireworks display was better than any Disney ones I have seen.

For people familiar with Dubai you'll be used the shambolic organisation of logistics and the poor communication of information. We booked tickets for the Gallery (around \u00a3275 per head). The info pack told us to go to Gate F. When the taxi dropped us off we asked several members of staff where Gate F was located. Some said that it was next to Gate C, others said that there was no Gate F. We actually needed to access Gate A but it took some time to discover this. The Gallery tickets provided food and drink all day. Staff manning the bars were just about the worst bar staff imaginable - many had little grasp of English. We had to teach the first barman how to make a Gin and Tonic!Food was actually superb. Great range of fish, salads, hot curries, sushi and Italian dishes on the buffet. Even though this is the biggest event of the year at this location the atmosphere does not match any large horse racing event in the UK. The crowd are very subdued, there's not much cheering and the stand is so big that it always feels half full. Getting home is not easy - everyone leaves after the concert so there are no taxis available. Buses took us all to the city and dropped us at a Metro station but the last metro had left about an hour earlier. Hundreds of people were then roaming the streets looking for a taxi. Even though it seems like an expensive ticket we got food and drink all day, really good access to the horses and jockeys and got to see Kylie in concert so we were at the track for 10 hours. There's also a very impressive firework display after the last race."

Most of the time we go in the free areas and mix with all the 'workers' who come for a free night out. Down at ground level you get a chance to hang over the rail at the parade ground, smell the atmosphere, then just turn around and watch the race on the enormous screens and see them pass the winning post. Turn back around and watch them come right past you into the winners enclosure. You can get a OK shawarma between races if you're prepared to join the disorganised queue, no alcohol at this level, for that you need to pay to get in the stands.But for a free evening out and if you want a very outside chance to win on one of the many race prediction games then go down market at course level. It's totally free, free parking, free entry, free programme and race schedule, that has to be amazing value.

The meals were awesome on both nights and the young man who served us was friendly and efficient, very commendable as he told us he was a trainee and the Thursday was his first race night. I would recommend these events, value for money and will definitely go again."

            "review": "World Cup Carnival - February 2015. I visited Meydan for the World Cup Carnival meets on the 26th and 28th of February. The grandstand and facilities are immense - think Ascot but about triple the size!I caught a taxi from the nearest Metro station - Business Bay (cost 25 Dirhams/around \u00a34) and the journey takes about 10-15 minutes depending on traffic. I opted for the 50 Dirham ticket/premier seating by the finish line. Access is via Gate A and be sure to collect your free betting slip and raffle ticket as you enter. This is the only gambling allowed at the track due to UAE laws. You can also collect a free race card from the information desk located inside. One part of the betting slip involves picking the winner of each of the six nominated races (races 2-7 in my case) - the Pick 6. If you manage to do so you're likely to collect a five figure cash sum if your the only winner. You'll also collect money if you manage to pick 4 or 5 winners as well. The other part of the betting slip is the tri cast - if you get any of them up well done! The raffle ticket had seven prizes ranging from \u00a31000 - \u00a3100 and the results were announced after race 6 on the big screen. Be sure to give this and your betting slip to staff twenty minutes before the first nominated race. All types of alcohol are served inside. I went for pints of Heineken which cost 40 dirhams/\u00a37. Apparently alcohol is one of the few things subject to tax in the UAE which is why it's expensive. You can either buy from the bars of have a waiter bring them to your seat. Although it's a very good view in the premier seats, there was not much of an atmosphere due to the fairly low numbers in attendance. This was the case on both days I visited and was the only slight disappointment. There were seven races in total each night (non world Cup meets generally have six). The first went off at 18:45 and the last at 22:15 hours. There is a taxi rank directly outside gate A. I waited five minutes for one on the Thursday and about 15 on the Saturday. There are taxi marshals controlling the queue, they do however offer the 'Lexus' taxi which are parked on the other side of the road. These are plain, white coloured, Lexus cars that cost about three or four times the price of a standard Dubai taxi. Overall, it's definitely worth going to Meydan if you're a racing fan, even if the atmosphere is a good deal more restrained that the likes of the UK. The crowd was a good mix of locals, families, expats and tourists - all well behaved, even me!"

We decided to celebrate Valentine's Day here as we were in Dubai & had a lovely time in their beautiful glassed in restaurant with a window seat overlooking the parading horses & the finish line. We purchased a four course meal for a fairly reasonable price & they had special things for Valentine's Day like a basket of bread in heart shapes, heart shaped chocolates with coffee etc. Good service & a great venue. As betting is illegal in the UAE it takes the edge off the visit for most non-UAE residents (you can, of course, place bets through other countries, & many people do) but for residents it's just a nice family day out with a play area for the kids & quite a few different areas to sit & food outlets to choose from. If you don't have your own car you will need to take a taxi (be careful not to take an unmarked car or it will be expensive). Coming back, the taxi line is long & the cars which arrive are mostly unmarked so you will need to negotiate a price - this is MOST important. There is a free shuttle bus which runs to Dubai Mall but it can take a while during peak times. We would definitely go again when in Dubai during their winter!!!!!"

We are a pair of 70year-old racing fans (National Hunt), but our three-day stopover in Dubai, en route to Mauritius, just happened to coincide with the Carnival . . . Not up for debate !As we were staying in Deira, on the opposite side of Dubai, we used the fabulous, and incredibly cheap (\u00a34.70 for a Day ticket to go anywhere, as often as you like) Metro to sightsee prior to then getting a short taxi ride from Downtown Dubai to the racecourse. The last race was 10.15pm, and a taxi had us back at the hotel by 11pm, for \u00a316. Amazing - it's a long way.It is like arriving at an international airport ! The taxi driver took us to the Meydan Hotel, whereupon we were given a buggy ride to the Ticket Office ! It is so big, we'd still be walking now without that ! We paid \u00a310 each to allow us to have a good look round, although we could have got in for free.The seating is very comfortable, with lots of space, and a drinks holder in the armrest. We had a substantial albeit snack, meal, which - with drinks - cost \u00a320 for two. It was entirely satisfactory. The staff want to serve you in your seats; cleaning is continual, even to polishing the handrails throughout the evening.As gambling is not allowed, we were surprised to find our ticket included a 'free bet' for a Placepot-type draw. We didn't find the winners though ! Equally surprising was that alcohol was freely available, whereas in Dubai generally it is only available in tourist hotels.The no-gambling also means no bookies and therefore no betting slips and NO LITTER !!! In addition littering in the street in Dubai will cost you \u00a3100. So there isn't any. UK please note !! The horses arrive at the start by means of a subway horsewalk, so that's difficult to see. Unsaddling is right in front of the stands. However the finish is where it should be, the screens are about 100m long, and there are continually-updating times shown on another huge screen.It goes without saying that the racing is first-class, and we even had Rishi Persad commentating ! This facility is so worthy of all the superlatives. It deserves its reputation and is a must-do for any racing fan lucky enough to visit Dubai. It is a very different experience to UK racing - as it should be."

Whilst most of the time, the starting gate was out of direct view, the 3 huge screens opposite had all the action until they came into view on the straight and thundered past the finish post in front of us.The waiters outside were very attentive and keen to keep us topped up with wine or beer. The restaurant area was very pleasant and spacious. The bar snack food was OK but Sushi was served in a plastic box, as if straight off the supermarket shelf. The cheesecake desert was the same and totally unnecessary, as there were not many diners and it would have only taken a few seconds to put it on a plate.Overall, it was a great experience and a lovely way to spend an evening."

Meydan Racecourse is an impressive place to visit, especially for watching races which start from November (planning available on http://www.dubaiworldcup.com/visit/calendar/racing-calendar). Outside for the worldcup, there are good seatting areas accessible for free (but you may choose to indulge yourself a nice diner with front view).I would however not recommend the \"stable tour\" which is proposed by the Meydan hotel. This is very pricey and you don't get really much value for your money. You are taken in a bus tour around the infrastructure and visit one of the stable. What is really lacking is a good guide. No overall background information on the importance of the horse race for the region, how the races are organised. how horses are trained, how is the life of a jockey,...there are so many topics which could be covered during this tour. Don't expect seeing horses training either. You see them in their boxes."

But people were giving us strange looks which made me feel like we weren't welcomed, but that's just my interpretation of it."

The building itself is amazing, its worth going just to see the grandstand. Entry to the main stands are free.For a country that aren't allowed to gamble, it has a great atmosphere and every one is cheering at the finish line. There is a free bus that takes you back to the main town for free at the end of the night, but if looking for a quick exit, there are plenty of taxis, and they are cheap."

After being in Dubai for 9 years, when we received an invitation from Emirates, we decided to go.Firstly getting there is a disaster. The same road is used once taxi's drop you off, so no traffic engineering or forethought has gone into the design. Getting out is another story...The food quality at the Emirates hospitality tent is appalling and if this is showcasing what they can do, they are doing themselves a huge disservice.Food is served on plastic plates and drinks in plastic cups, this is the world's richest horse race, premiere occasion and everyone dressed up, eating as if you are in a fast food court in Al Quoz.All in all a terrible day and waste of time."

We purchased a Sky Bubble ticket which is a function area at the very top of the grandstand, comprising 3 floors. Due to poor ticket sales only part of the 7th floor was turned into a function area with food and beverages. This was quickly swamped by ex pats who tucked in to the unlimited alcohol and soon lost interest in the races and went into party mode. The next two higher floors were empty and there were some spare chairs, so we and a handful of others , went up there, enjoyed relative peace while watching the races. The trouble with the Sky Bubble is it has a massive structural steel triangular lattice to support the glazing, which obstructs the view markedly. Also there are no outdoor balconies so you miss the noise and excitement of the race. In the end we ended up in the general public area, trackside on the grass and enjoyed ourselves much more. The general cleanliness of the Sky Bubble area was poor with door handles missing on external doors, filthy toilets on floor 8 and dirty glazing. Nowhere near the crowd of Flemington on a Melbourne Cup, considering the prize money on offer."

We arrived at around 6pm and were shown to our table with a glass of prosecco. There was an outside balcony area offering seats and view over the racecourse. From that moment on the drinks were flowing and the service was fantastic whenever your glass looked empty another was brought from the great selection offer. The food was great and such a choice. Loads of shellfish within the starters. A carvery of beef was also available. You could just graze all evening. The racing was a great thing to see. We had a great eveing and would return.

We thought it was going to be a struggle truth be told. Taxi from JBR was \u00a313 including tip which is pretty amazing considering the distance covered. Same trip back home would easily be \u00a350. It's a wonderful setting from the outside and reminded me a lot of Ascot back home. I had bought tickets for Silks restaurant with free alcohol for about \u00a370 which turned out to be the best value ever. From the moment we arrived at 6pm to the minute we left at 10pm, our glasses were topped up constantly with lovely Prosecco. The views from our table looking over the course were magnificent and we could sit outside for each race and still be topped up. The good was exquisite. Glorious. Amazing. Fantastic. Many other ways to define excellent. Great variety and felt more gourmet than buffet. Constantly refreshed and heated perfectly as well. The guys were really helpful when puting on the pick 6 and tricasts etc and whilst we didn't win any of the big prizes on offer, it was good to have the chance without paying a single penny......or dirham.... as it's free to enter. When leaving there were plenty of taxis and we got back to our hotel very sharp. An excellent experience and one I would urge all to do if lucky enough to be here when racing is on."

We booked tickets for the Silks restaurant before we left the UK. On arrival at the racecourse we were transported to the ticket collection office where our tickets were in our hands with one minute. No queuing or waiting for them to be found. Once in the restaurant the views of the course were amazing and my husband and I upgraded our tickets so that we could have some drinks with the delightful buffet which ran all evening. The staff looked after us very well indeed especially the young man from Nepal (I am sorry I don't have his name).The racing was magnificent - all the horses were top class. Sheik Mohammed has really built a first class venue. Ascot and other top English courses could learn many lessons from Meydan. Brilliant."

We had a super view of the finish and the large screens are the largest I have seen at any event. We enjoyed smoked duck breast followed by lamb shank or a fish dish followed by cheese and biscuits. The accompanying wines were enjoyable too. We had almost exclusive service from a relatively new Indian waitress and she did a wonderful job throughout. Every member of staff we encountered was a credit to Meydan.Top tip is the first race is not usually included in the six to follow!Top tip two is allow 30 minutes in aCar from Dubai MallOur taxi was able to drop us off and collect us without delay but there was not a full house."

The Red Carpet Restaurant stall was particularly virulent.I love racing; I do not bet so that was not a problem; I like a drink on course but that is not available in the public enclosure. the race cards (free) did not list the officialsIf you like racing go to one of the better enclosures and have a good night outIf you want to take a look at the free enclosure, take your own picnic and a hip flask.I look forward to being back at Bangor soon.

Meydan on a \"standard\" evening's racing is Ascot without the attitude; Churchill Downs without the crowds; Flemington without the Fosters; Longchamp without the \"louche\". In other words its a world class racing venue with a true soul. Strange to be somewhere where gambling is not permitted but there is a free to enter competition. At the bargain basement end is free admission but we went for broke and reserved a table in the pay-and-view \"Tiered\" restaurant. A choice of 2 starters, 2 mains and dessert plus wines and other alcoholic drinks for 450 dirhams for the pair of us - excellent views, excellent food and excellent value. To be fair this was the first meeting of the season so there were a few glitches with the service but nothing that spoiled the overall enjoyment of the evening. As a first time visitor there are a couple of tips we have noted:The first race for most evening meetings is at 6.30pm which coincides with some of Dubai's worst traffic jams so factor in plenty of time to get to the course.If booking tickets on line they can be easily collected on the evening from the ticket office this avoiding any risk of postage / additional costs.Anyone keen on racing visiting Dubai during the \"season\" should make an evening at Meydan a MUST!"

Fully floodlit to accommodate golf at all hours, The Track Golf Course at Meydan is a very pleasant and welcoming establishment, and it was no surprise to see that Troon Golf - possibly the best golf facility management company around - were responsible for the day to day organisation.

Dubai world cup is the richest thoroughbred horserace with a total combination prize of $27.25 million of 9 races. The last rase being the world cup race prize was $10million.13 countries participated at the event. 10 -16 horses participated in each race. The race is held annually at the last saturday of March at Meydan racecourse . We arrived at 5 pm, doors had been open at 2.00 p.m and the first race had started at 4.30. As we were pulling in to the parking lot we waited inline for a good 20 minutes. They had public parking a little away from the racecourse . They had shuttle buses transporting ppl from the parking lot to the racecourse. It was timely and very organized. Tikets ranged from 25 AED - 3500 AED. We bought our tickets a few days ahead of time from the Meydan ticket office as we were told tickets will not be sold at the gate the day of the race.Surprisingly most of the high priced tickets were sold out only the 1200 AED and the 350 AED tickets were available. The difference was 1200 had drinks / food included and the 350 did not. However there were a few restaurants on the 1st floor. The Meydan racecourse is very impressive, takes your breath away at first glance. Having been open just 3 years a go, It is a modern racecourse with a majestic grand stand that accommodates 60 thousand spectators. Ladies were dressed to impress. Some made some serious fashion statement with outrageous hats and accessories. It was truly fun to see all the fashion hits and misses, certainly fashion police would have had a field day. There were some awards for the best dressed lady, best dressed man and best dressed couple. The ambiance was truly wonderful and relaxing. Nice weather, great entreatment, a fun place to socialize with friends.Between the races there were a few entreatments such as beautiful fireworks and very impressive acrobatic airplane shows. There were 9 horse races the last one being the big money race. I was rooting for the US based horses such as Royal Delta and Animal kingdom. I was so trilled to see 'Animal Kingdom' win the $10million race. This 5 year old thoroughbred race horse was pulled out of races in 2012 due to leg injury. It was so wonderful to see him win this race by an impressive two lengths. What a comeback !!After the award ceremony the celebration continued with an amazing solo concert of Seal . The concert was an icing on the cake ! excellent show. Seal was amazing as usual. Unfortunately we did not stay till the end of the concert as we had a flight to catch in a few hours.We thoroughly enjoyed this event. I highly recommend it. If we are in Dubai during the next world cup we will definitely attend.A few suggestions - The duration of the event is a good 10 hours. There will be a lot of drinking . I suggest to take a taxi home/ hotel. It is safe and saves you time from the parking long line.Dress fashionably but tastefully. Avoid too reviling dresses as it is offensive to the coulter. Keep in mind betting is not permitted in Dubai but world cup races are widely available for betting in the US. It is truly a glamorous and fun event. A must attend if in Dubai during the event.Enjoy!!"

Few points to be mindful off.Queues to the ladies - are about the longest I've ever seen. Admittedly it's a bit race, but happens every year and not sure what it's like inbetween, but the queues where back down the corridor. Fast food area - extremely slow. Waited for nearly an hour at the chicken stall (which looked to be the fastest queue). So time it here wisely.Taxi's - forget it. We gave up and got a bus to Emirates Mall and then made our way in a taxi from there. Friends told us the next day they waited nearly 2hours for a taxi, so staying later and the shuttle bus option proved to be a wise move, even though it seemed crazy slow at the time.Though the race and atmosphere itself while there is brilliant. And all the above aside, I would go again. Just make sure some plans b and even c are made in advance :)Enjoy"

The service was impeccable with drinks constantly being topped up & we were asked if we were ready to accept each course. Although not regular racegoers we thoroughly enjoyed the race programme & were excited to have the opportunity to watch Kieron Fallon race!

On our visit to Dubai we decided to visit Meydan Racecourse for one of the Thursday night Dubai Racing Carnival series races after reading reviews here.We booked the Tiered Restaurant which was 450AED pp which includes house alcoholic beverages as well as a 3/4 course set menu. The views are brilliant onto the racecourse which gave you a clear view of the paddock as well as the track. Standard entry is about 25AED pp which gives you limited access in building but can go out by track.There is 6 races each Thursday night and you can book online which we did from the UK. Taxi out to Meydan was about 40AED and 30mins from our hotel in Bur Dubai area. There is no betting allowed which we forgot as Dubai is in a Muslim country, in which betting is illegal. This brings a weird twist to going to the horses. There is however a scorecard system in operation which is free, thus no betting. The card has the six races on it and you choose the horse against your program which is provided in each race and management take the body of the card away leaving you the counterfoil. I am unsure what the winning prize is as we were useless at picking the winning horses that night. The food is exquisite and the staff are very tentative to all your needs. There is a waitress/ waiter for ever two tables. We had a fantastic night and I would highly recommend a visit to the racecourse on your visit to Dubai."

We stayed and had dinner at a lovely restaurant there on the ground floor by the paddock. The food was DELICIOUS and reasonably priced. There is no betting there, of course, but the races were fun to watch regardless. There are gift shops there so you can get a nice memento, but the prices are crazy high.

My boyfriend is a racing journalist and I'm a keen race-goer so we were both looking forward to the actual racing but the hospitality was second to none. The price of the tickets for two worked out at less than \u00a3160 and for that we had a delicious 4 course dinner and unlimited alcoholic drinks for the evening as well as having the best seats in the house. Getting out the taxi, the course certainly has the wow factor and once we got up to the restaurant it was equally as impressive. Huge floor to ceiling windows gave uninterrupted views over the course and our table directly overlooked the parade ring and has an excellent view of the finish line.All the staff were super helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble, lots of photo taking!!!The meal was delicious, and spaced over the evening so you could enjoy the racing between courses. It was a very different experience to racing in the UK due to the lack of betting but the \"pick 6\" competition they run did give an element of excitement to proceedings.Overall though I can't recommend the experience enough, it was excellent value for money, completely fabulous and racing in England will never be the same again now I've experience it Dubai style."

For the same cost there is the lovely Faldo course at the Emirates course.On a positive the track is amazing as is the grandstand it will be even better maybe world class when it is all finished lots of loose ends everywhere."

You will see the most elegant ladies in Dubai in their finest outfits, some also in dreadful attires just to attract attention! At least one month before the event, which always takes place at the end of March, the tailors in town are busy, ladies are choosing dresses, shoes, trying the hats and fascinators which just arrived at M&S, Debenhams but also, for more up market, at Al Wafi mall, Burjuman and the best address in Dubai for the most beautiful hats, Eve Michele in Jumeira. The local magasines (Ahlan, Grazia...) give fashion advices for the occasion. There is a lot of anticipation and excitment in town prior to the big event and the hope for some ladies to win the best dressed, best hat prices. Before, the races used to be in Nad al Sheba but three (I think) years ago it moved to bigger and better facilities at Meydan. I went twice to the event in Nad al Sheba and liked it very much, so I was very excited for the first time at Meydan. The weather was nice which was a relief because the days before had been dusty, windy and hot and everything was going very very well until the 3rd race. One of the horse fell badly during the race, didn't get up and the race had to be cancelled. I was completely shocked because the few times I went to a big race, twice at Nad al Sheba and twice au Grand Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Auteuil Paris, I didn't witness an accident like that. It spoiled my pleasure a little and made me think that \"un accident est si vite arrive\" (an accident happens so quickly), in a second in front of your eyes. This is part of the sport of horse racing I suppose but I didn't really realised this until now. It is not only nice hats and designer dresses, there is also pain and hurt in it. I didn't stay until the end and I read later that 2 other horses were hurt when the race ,which was cancelled ,was rerun! I am not sure I would like to go again next year, the fun went a little out of it for me."

Great views, fabulous track, unfortunately a horse broke its leg, Sheikh Mohammed was there, great fire works, sky diving, a stunt plane, name it. But how on earth do they dare to serve this food???? They should be ashamed! Sandwiches without fantasy, dry, boring. But even worse was the buffet diner. I went for seafood. Cheap, seared Chilian salmon, tasteless, pale. Presented by a chef of the JW Marriott. A 5* hotel. Big mistake. The sushi wasn't sushi, but a disaster, thai fish cakes, embarressing! Dim sum: if you don't know how to make it, just don't try. The only chef how's ok is the pastry chef. His chocolate mousse was great, as were the carrot cakes. The rest of the food was a big, BIG disappointment. Reducing food costs doesn't mean offending or mistreating your guest. People who paid a lot of money for a nice time out."

Around \u00a327 will get you a gold badge which gives you access to the trendy glass fronted paddock lounge and your own seat (very comfortable) in the grandstand. The beer is expensive but having waiter service and not having throwing elbows at the bar to get a pint between races for me makes up for the extra cost. It's a very different racing experience but not necessarily better. For me the place lacks atmosphere (I went on Super Saturday 2012). In fact, I drew a few puzzled looks as a shouted my horse in, very different to Cheltenham the next week.Definitely worth a visit but for me it''s behind Longchamp, Cheltenham and York in the top racecourse stakes."

This race meeting is a few weeks before the World Cup and includes some the horses running in the World Cup plus all the top jockeys including F. Dettori.The racecourse and grandstand are perfect. Almost looks unreal. Tiered Restaurant is an amazing experience. Superb seats and service. What a way to watch horse racing. A must do in Dubai even if you have no interest in horse racing.Only downside was the meal was not great but overall this did not prevent us loving the whole experience."

What a night out, even if you are not a racing fan!A 7 course dinner - all small portions so not bloating, but all delicious. Drinks included (less champagne), a waiter devoted to our table, which overlooked the paddock, and the winning post. Excellent racing including a Group 1 Race. When I asked to leave the air conditioned terrace to go down to the paddock, an escort/guide was provided.This was racing in style and comfort. If only they had jump racing there!"

It is about half a mile long with fantastic facilities and views over the course.I sat in the Premium Seating (approx \u00a310) and you get a great view with refreshements served at your seat if you wish. A pint of beer was about \u00a36 though. The Pick 6 game is a bit of fun with a really good cash prize to the winner if you can pick all 6 winners.Getting back to the city centre afterwards was a bit chaotic - there seemed a lack of normal taxis so I ended up getting a private hire car which was about double the normal price. Still only about \u00a311 to get back to city centre though.If you are a sports fan then you must visit Meydan Races."

            "review": "A night to remember forever. Went to Meydan for the Super Thursday meeting 2011 and had pre booked the tiered restaurant package for myself and my wife as part of our 25th wedding anniversary trip, paid about \u00a3160 each for 5 course meal with house wine included. The view from our table was outstanding, right over the paddock/unsaddling area with the winning post just to our right. You couldn't miss Dettori's flying dismount.The grandstand is huge, it's free to get in at the lower levels, thats where all the locals go, and you start paying the further up the chain you want to go. If you go just for premium seating, this is directly opposite to the winning post with great views, access to bars and food outlets within the grandsatnd, a siimilar set up to UK racecourses and is around \u00a310/20 for the seat depending on the meeting.The evening started slowly as the staff were not overly attentive to the tables in our area of the restaurant and the service wasn't great, but once I had been spoken to the floor manager about this it improved sufficiently. The meal itself was good, not excellent as you might have hoped. However you go for the overall experience if you are a racing follower and this can't be faulted. Obviously no betting, gambling is illegal and websites are blocked, but if you are a regular racegoer use other methods. You are given a pick 7 competition entry form based on 7 races, which is like a jackpot, but they will pay out on less winners if nobody picks 7. I was lucky to get a return of about \u00a3100 on 4 winners because nobody got more than 5. The fun I had trying to fight my way down from the stands ,past security guards, and in to the paddock to claim my prize will live with me forever, there were 100's of locals all claiming to be one of six winners.Without the help of one of the waiters I kidnapped to help me I may never have made it. not the biggest win ever but one of the most exciting. Also very lucky to meet a couple away for their 25th as well and hopefully we'll meet again at Hamilton races and be friends for a long time. It all helped Meydan be a memorable experience."

Living down the street from Aintree Racecourse I'm hard to impress when it comes to Horse Racing.I worked a long hard day at the Dubai World Cup in 2005 and can honestly say those people pay for what they get! The tents are fabulously decorated with gold and extravagant champagne flows like it's tap water, the luxurity is off the charts. Betting is not permitted in Dubai except by phone and so alot of the atmosphere is lost that you would expect at such an event.It's an amazing day out and I would recommend it to anyone who has a flutter during the Grand National, myself being one of them. Just be prepared for one hell of a taxi que, that's if you stay as late as we did, I think we eventually left at 12-1am.A fun day to be had and a good chance to get dressed up and feel like a millionaire!"
