Our hotel was along Salisbury Road so we were able to take a walk along the promenade and enjoy the view during the evening. You also get to appreciate the view from the star ferry. At night it is beautiful with all the lights lighting up on the buildings."

It is most beautiful at dusk or early evening when the sun is setting and the city lights start to come on. For tourists, it is best viewed from the Peak on the Hong Kong Island side, but the locals could go to other hilltops (with some extra efforts) to have a better view eg from Braemar Hill."

Why not start start your harbour views by taking the walkway to the Star Ferry from near Worldwide House. At he Star Ferry go down and experience the harbour right at its very edge, with ferries coming and going and some spectacular cross harbour views.. There is even a maritime museum which is quite interesting. Keep walking along until you get to the elevated walkway that takes you back into the IFC building (you can see it ahead) and walk all the way through the IFC to the exit about 50 meters after the Four Seasons hotel entrance you will see on your right. Now you are on an elevated walkway that goes to Macau Ferry terminal. This is hub for travel to Macau and makes interesting wandering around with a few good places to eat including some restaurants offering Macanese dishes without making the trip to Macau (which you should do any way!!). You can exit this complex and if you are keen keep heading about 300m, a bit of a struggle past bus terminals and the government Harbour Building, but keep heading West to one of Hong Kong's hidden gems, the Dr. Sun Yat Sen park. Its a beautiful circular design with references to Dr. Sun's journeys establishing the Republic of China. Here there is nothing between you and the water except a fence line. Stay for half and hour and you will see all manner of sea vessels including the hydrofoils just getting up out of the water on their path to Macau. Spectacular and you will be one of the few tourists that made the trip! On your way back you could take in the Western Market across from the Macau Ferry building."

The old central district that was the hub of government activity has evolved into a high end commercial center with extensive indoor \"malls\" that extend up the hillside. Most notably there is new development on the hillside beyond the waterfront, which had become a quality restaurant and late night gathering spot. One needs to navigate this district, as there are open bar-fronts, but more notable quality and reasonably prices restaurants that are above the street level entrances. This is a great place to go for Sunday brunch. With new developments on the waterfront this area is rapidly evolving -- from the Central district into the Western district, which is an interesting mix of \"old\" Hong Kong and new commercial and office developments that are pushing out the old \"chop houses\" and family shops."

Then take the tram up to Victoria Peak just in time for sunset don't pay for the return ticket and just walk down avoiding massive 2 hour tram queue to go back down.

The Star Ferry offers great views of the city skyline. Unfortunately the harbour is slowly being filled in to reclaim more land for development.

The illuminated ships and skyscrapers, combined with the natural beauty of the harbour made it an unforgettable evening. Only negative was the high menu prices at the lounge."

Go to the maritime museum - it's not free though. Also watch the fishing from the piers. Slightly inland are some formal gardens that are free. Also the equivalent on the London eye ,- also not free.You can also catch the ferry to various places for a pretty nominal fee."

The view is spectacular and we got to check out the fireworks which made this trip even more awesome. After walking around the HUGE shopping mall near the harbor and soaking in the awesome view, we hopped on the ferry to get to our hotel, which was on the opposite side of the harbor. I would highly recommend taking the ferry, it was a fun experience."

On the water there is always the possibility of sighting a sampan, a junk or perhaps the arrival or departure of a cruise ship.

A very busy harbour where the cruise ships stop. loads of shopping in the harbour area night & day, high street high end shopping malls for the cruise ships, worth visiting the Peninsula hotel lobby, stroll to the day & night markets, in fact it is one big shopping and eating area of Kowloon. If you are over in central you can view from a distance, take the MTR or boat over to Kowloon. Hong Kong is a crazy city, noisy, colourful but very expensive, been there, bought the Tshirt and enjoyed the experience."

But nothing beats this classical looking Aqua Luna. This red-sail junk offers different time slot for sailing such as evening sailing, sunset sailing, or for the Symphony of Lights slot while you are relaxing on the lounge beds. The price differs for the third option. Back to this Victoria Harbour, it is one of the few reasons people throng to Hong Kong. I am fortunate that it did not rain as I was here since 6pm to wait for the blue hour and for the light show at 8pm, however it was foggy and hence those giant structures were not sharp in the picture as I wish them to be. Nevertheless, it is still a wonderful experience to see the lights dance in the dark while enjoying the cool breeze"

Yes the Junks are still there but in a smaller number and yes families still live on many of them. The harbor is smaller due to the back fill from the new airport and the need to build new high rises. Today the harbor is home to many very high dollar yacht. A tour of the water front by boat still is exciting but there is something missing, and that is the hundreds of people who lived on the many small boats and docks now gone."

However, you aren't going to be swimming in it so it is a minor factor but don't expect to see the 'jewel like beauty of its water' as one travel brochure put it. It is the best place to view the skylines of both sides of the harbour. It is a functional part of Hong Kong daily life as people travel to and from Hong Kong itself.

We were staying at 4 Seasons with harbour view rooms and were captivated 24/7 with the ever changing action. Night and day this place is busy with shipping movements of all types. Helicopters back and forward and large hawks always in view. The night lights of the city are brilliant and it is lovely to see little boats going to and from making sure any garbage is removed (by hand). Other Asian nations need to look and learn - HK has it right!"

Catch the Chinese Junk party boat lit up in red lights. When we were there in November, 2015, the Avenue of the Stars was closed for renovations, and apparently until late into 2016. I remembered going to the Intercontinental lounge bar about 26 years ago. Still has the great same view as seen. They do have a minimum of about $25 USD. That is basically the cost of a drink there anyway. Great way to see the harbour, and relax before dinner. Highly recommended.

There are a couple of ways to see it:1.) The Star Ferry - the ferry that shuttles people between Hong Kong and Kowloon. Cheap and great, you can take a couple routes here and only spend a couple bucks. Highly recommend this. 2.) The Peak - If you are in Hong Kong, you will probably be heading to The Peak. This is more expensive than taking a Star Ferry, but in my opinion, the view from the top is still worth the trip, particularly since you will likely be taking the Peak Tram up as it is, which is cool in itself. 3.) Boat tours - the last time I toured the harbor was on the Duk Ling, which was $5 for anyone with a foreign passport! I've been informed that this tour has since been deprecated, however, there are still other options available (although I doubt they will be as cheap as the Duk was).You may be advised to pick one route by day, and the other at night."

Millions of light bulbs shining the harbour making it a city that never sleeps. Walking in winter time is nice, weather is fantastic for walking around Tsim Sha Tsui and take a ferry to Central. But some points to make it slightly unattractive:1. Environmental: Didn't Hong Kong people think it a waste of energy for building such an illuminated city?2. Chinese: Don't want to say discrimination against Chinese, but there are really lots of impolite Chinese in Hong Kong. Great different from ten years ago. This city is being not that clear from before."

As I recall, this happened around 9 PM. Our group walked to the area from our hotel (Shangri-La) because it was close to the event. Go a little early so that you can get a place near the water's edge. There is a metal railing that you can lean on if there is space. Take your camera! Wear comfortable shoes."

It is the small narrow harbour between Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island but not the coastal strips along it. To have a good view of it, the best ways are (i) to go up Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island on a sunny day or at night when it is neither raining nor misty and watch the harbour below among lights on both sides of the harbour or (ii) to have a ride on a ferry from Tsim Sha Tsui to Central after some meal or shopping on a sunny day. The night scenary of this harbour is world-class in every respect and far exceeds what you can see in Paris or Hokkaido at night. Taking some other cross-harbour route by ferry or a ride on a private launch will be 2 other options, but you will be either missing quite a lot or some key focal points. Amateur photographers will find the night scenary really good subject for a few shots, too."

It is located in the very southern tip of the Hong Kong's inland, with view across, toward the Hong Kong Island. Otherwise, it is clinched between the Kowloon, in the main land of Hong Kong and the waters of the sea passage, that separates the Hong Kong Island from the rest. And of course the nearness of South China Sea ,even more makes this geographical position, strategic one. Such condition was profited in the full measure by British government in its new colony. Beside the last mentioned, with the passing of time, Hong Kong was becoming more and more, one very important trading center, in this part of the world.We had been showed, the second night of our sojourn in Hong Kong, the magnificent light show of the blinkering and wavering blurbs, that moved from the top to the bottom and in the opposite way, along the skyscrapers, that were across the dark masses of waters, on the Hong Kong island. That's what is called the Hong Kong Skyline. No one, during his visit, miss such feast of lights and sounds, followed by excited wows of numerous tourists and natives as well. Here, in this harbor, we, the people from all over the world, are the witnesses of everlasting struggle for the land in such narrow straight, that also affects the natural surroundings and habitats, and water quality as well.Unforgettable evening, it was, there in Hong Kong Port !"

My family and I came here several years ago(actually Dec 2013) around the Christmas holiday during the day time(did not come at night) I wanted to revisit this place after departed HK years ago. Across the bay, a lot things have changed, more taller buildings than before and the place is a bit smoggy. We strolled along the pier and visited the Avenue of Star then hopped on the memorable ferry for a small fee and cross the bay from Kowloon to HK side(ride is about 10min) to ride the famous cable car. I enjoyed the ferry and cable car ride. It brings back a lot of memory. Anyway, go to the harbor and catch a ferry, its a good experience.Note: The Star cruise ship docked at one of the pier closed to the harbor."

If you are someone who loves the sea, oceans and anything with water in it, and boats, ferries, cruise liners and 'working ships', this is a place that should not be missed.The best part is that it is not expensive at all to be on one of those vessels viz the Star Ferry which costs only HKD 2 to 2.50 depending on whether you take the lower or upper deck, to go from Kowloon to Hong Kong Island.However, looking at the harbour is sterile, and if you only want to see a harbour, then any other harbour anywhere in the world would be just as good. A harbour is a harbour is a harbour and that's it. Hahaha!You get the sense and true story, indeed, about the harbour when you realise that Hong Kong is built around its harbour. The long line of buildings on Hong Kong Island tells the story of how its success is achieved, especially as a major world financial centre. Looking at the other side of the harbour, Tsim Sha Tsui tells how Hong Kong makes its money through tourism, with its plethora of shopping malls, shops, loud advertisements and blinding neon lights.However, I did for a moment get philosophical and contemplative because I noticed two distinct groups of people. The first group was the Hong Kongers who were working hard in the hotels, shops and even on the sea vesels, and various other places catering to the second group, the tourists.As a very small city with 1,100 sq km of land, and only about half of which is \"human-friendly\" and hence useable for residential and commercial purposes, the sad fact of Hong Kong life is that most people live in very tiny flats.The long row of super high rise office buildings and hotels lining the praya of the harbour may make a fantastic tourist backdrop for taking photos, telling the story of the Hong Kong miracle, but I can imagine that life in Hong Kong for the locals is not all about neon lights."

There are plenty of souvenir shops in the area, places with snacks (for example - squid) and many views to enjoy. You can also hop on a bus and walk through the streets of Hong Kong to get there from the opposite side."

We live on a farm in a rural area in NZ so it was a complete contrast to that. People were friendly and made space so we could take photos and we were lucky enough to have a friend fromHong Kong point out some of the buildings and places of interest. Later in the week we travelled on the Star Ferry and saw a different view of the Victoria Harbour but from dry land we had better views as we walked around the pathway at the harbour."

It is completely surrounded by the urban metropolis that is Hong Kong, but the views are outstanding! I went both day and night, if you go during the day get the Star Ferry across the water its extremely cheap and takes you from one side of the river to the other, however on your way across the views of the skyline are just wow. However what is even more WOW is the light show at night. We got there 20 minutes early and got a spot on the rail so we could see, I would advise this as it got really busy, and just sit and watch the lights on all the skyscrapers unfold. It is unbelievable, I have attached a picture to this review so you can see. If your in Hong Kong you MUST go and see this!"

If you prefer night lights, go there just before sunset.If you are in the Kowloon area, you can take a bus or an MTR to Tsim Sha Tsui station and follow the directions outside the station to walk to the Victoria Harbor. For the best view, you can book yourself on the Star Ferry that cruises in the sea every hour. There is a light and sound show (Laser lights from almost all the buildings on either side of the harbor) at 8 pm. For 210 HKD per person on the Star Ferry, this show might not be spectacular....but not bad either. We went to HK in December last week and for the three days we were there, it was cloudy.

This time when I travelled again, I still preferred the lower deck, not just paying a little less, but really gives you direct view or touch to Victoria Harbour, which most people will think stand higher will look more. This is not the case. For upper deck is all surrounded and window is high to block you away from the scene. Lower deck, though hotter with sense of machine oil, it gives you nearer distance no blocking to Victoria Harbour. No matter day or night, the view is fantastic!"

There are tour boats but my view is that the Star Ferry boats are the best way to see the harbour and there are options on the routes from Central or Wan Chai or Hung Hom. And, of course, the Star Ferry has a special place in HK history - it's an icon of HK development and transportation so a trip is a must.And however good the daytime crossing is that do a crossing at night when all the 'neons' are lit up; spectacular. The views across the harbour are especially good at night even if you don't make a ferry crossing. And it's all FOC -plus there's a laser light show each evening at 8.00pm. Another touch of the spectacular. One can spend as little time or as long a time as one wants - all depends on how the mood takes you."

This is one of those places that is so heavily written about and photographed/videoed/painted that one is not surprised when viewing it. Like other such places (the Eifel Tower, the Grand Canyon. Niagara Falls), this perhaps detracts from the actual experience.If I had only viewed the Grand Canyon from its South Rim, I might have been bored. But the Grand Canyon is actually spectacular, and somewhat unexpected, if one visits the North Rim \u2013 which is not so media-hyped. Similarly for the Eifel Tower \u2013 which can be dramatic from some visual angles, such as when standing behind and around the Fountain of Warsaw, such as when standing on the Esplanade du Trocadero (where IMHO the combination of sight, sound, and sense of the water spray cannot be recreated by the media). One needs to maneuver quite a bit, IMHO, in order to find an unexpectedly impressive view of Niagara Falls, as that place has been so over-hyped. However, any view of Iguazu Falls is stupendous IMHO, because (1) it's stunning and (2) un-hyped and thus mostly unexpected.There is no shortage of impressive views of Hong Kong Harbour. And, fortunately, sounds and other senses factor into the enjoyment of that skyline. For me, unquestionably the best way to enjoy the harbour is to walk around the landward and island sides, and to ply between the two using the Star Ferry.But, unfortunately, the bad air caused by failures to control air pollution upwind (allegedly mostly over the border) gets in the way of this enjoyment all too often. That problem is not merely visual. It's also a health issue.Note to those responsible for monitoring and regulating air quality - apparently in Shenzen and elsewhere in Guandung Province: do your jobs, or stand aside for those who will do it in your place!"

I think one day it will be disappeared all together because of the land reclamation that the HK Government decided to build more road on the water fronts instead of leave it as it is!

You can also opt for a Night Cruise on the Star Ferry - good views of the neon-lit skyline & the Victoria harbour, from the ferry."

We hoofed it over here after our plane actually managed to arrive EARLY and after basically running from the airport to the train to a taxi and to the river, we were absolutely blown away by the size and beauty of the skyline in front of us. We never got to see it during the daylight, but at night it only adds to the impressiveness that Hong Kong is as a city. The Symphony of Lights is a laser light 'show' along the skyline of Hong Kong Island seen from Victoria Harbour. I use the word show a bit loosely because I'll be honest in that the show is not all that incredibly impressive... however, the skyline itself IS impressive. We ended up taking the Star Ferry over to the other side, and it was such a neat experience seeing the city at night. Our next stop was the tram station up to Victoria Peak, which I also highly recommend.So, make seeing the Hong Kong Island skyline at night a priority! A must-see!! Tons of food and nice shopping in the immediate surrounding area too.We took the Airport Express Train from Hong Kong International Airport to the Kowloon Station (if you have a group of 4+ you can buy group tickets for MUCH cheaper at the customer service counter .. the group tickets were not in the ticket machines).. then it isn't a far walk to the Harbour, but we did take a very cheap taxi since we were rushing to see The Symphony of Lights... plus we only had 12 hours in HK :)"

Sorry New York, London and Singapore, but the Hong Kong skyline is unparalleled - nowhere else in the world is there a city so densely populated and glamorous. The sight is intensive any time of the day: the harbour greets you with a jungle of concrete and glass during the day, bustling with life with all the road and sea traffic, and lights assault you from all directions at night. There's a light show at 8pm every day, which to be honest feels very contrived. If you happen to be around during Chinese New Year (or 1 July Handover Day, or 1 October National Day), there are awesome fireworks too. Best time to visit would be around sunset so you see both daytime and nighttime versions of the city. People disagree on which side of the harbour looks better (my vote goes to the island side, ie the view from the promenade in Tsim Sha Tsui), but the best way of seeing the harbour is - get on the water, duh! My favourite way is definitely the Star Ferry (dirt cheap)."

It's about a 10 minute ride and it cost less than $3 (USD) total for my family of 4 roundtrip. Sit on the top (covered) deck. Walk along the waterfront in Kowloon and go in the malls (one on each side) to cool off. It's a cheap day and we didn't feel like we missed out by not taking the standard harbor cruise. This could easily be a 3-4 hour outing from the airport by taking the Airport Express train to Hong Kong Station - the ticket machines are easy to use and there are lots of signs to help you on the journey. English announcements on the train. It's a little less than 30 minutes from the airport to Hong Kong Station. The piers are about a 10 minute walk from the train.

And you want to be close up and personal, especially for the nightly laser light show at 8PM. Hope you stay at the YMCA and get a harbor side room on the 15th or 16th floor, because rooms have huge picture windows. No other hotel is this close with mid-rise height. Just sit in your arm chair and enjoy the scene. Better even than going on the ferry, though that's an experience too. Suggest skip dinner cruises with typical mediocre food and amenities. We were lucky enough to have one rainy day, which gave a whole new atmosphere to the harbor - skyscrapers disappearing in the clouds. Photo possibilities are fantastic. Right across the street is the harbor walk, with fun crowds and vendors."

The cruise operated by the Hong Kong tourism office using a motorised Chinese junk can be booked at the Hong Kong tourism office in Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon Star ferry terminal. You can board teh 1 hour long cruise either at Hong Kong Central or at the Tsim Sha Tsui side.The highlight is not just the views around the harbour and the breeze blowing at your face. It is the small junks and boats moored around the typhoon shelter at Causeway Bay which gives you a glimpse of the soul of hong Kong. These small boats are homes to a community that has existed since the colonial times and a way to beat the sky-rocketing cost of housing in Hong Kong. You cna see it is a community there with restaurants on some boats, temple on another with colourful banners decorating these boats. You see the fame Noon Gun along the way. AFter this stretch teh landscape changes to the usual high rise as well as the high-rise apartments and office block. The further you move away from Central the landscape changes to a less commercial scene. Passing the old KaiTak airport terminal and runway, you could still imagine the big jets roaring down the roof tops of apartment threatening the laundry left to dry. Alas the place now is being converted into a cruise terminal. the cruise will bring your sense from the paast to the present when the neon lights on top of building re-appear near Tsim Sha Tsui. All these time you would have passed barges carrying all sorts of materials to & from the harbour to ships anchored outside.The business of the harbour mirrors the pace of life on shore. you can see, sense and smell commerce, the lifeline of this place.Best time to visit this attraction is the cooler months towards the end of the year or early in the year.The cost, very affordable and well worth it. See for yourself."

We were on a boat ride to an out island for an evening of seafood dinner at the Rainbow Seafood Restaurant one April evening this year. The sky was relatively clear and we were afforded the chance to view the Harbour scene in its glory. However, if your visit to the Harbour is on a day when fog and mist rule, the timing may not be the best for your viewing. We were at the Peak a couple of days after our boat ride and the fog was so thick that we were not even able to see a glimpse of the Harbour from above.

What you may not know is that this is a harbor unlike any other, both from a historical and scenic point of view. Don't worry about studying up, you'll understand as soon as you see it, or cross it on the Star Ferry. The only thing to concern you is how to view it. Here's my vote: Given just a brief time to behold its majesty, opt for a room on the Kowloon side facing Hong Kong, and pray for a clear night."

The Peak shows you the city from above while the harbor shows you fantastic views from across the water spanning as far as the eye can see. To access the viewing platform on the Tsim Sai Tsui (Kowloon) side of the Harbor the best way is to take the Star Ferry from Pier 7 in Central, easily accessed by Central MTR station for 2.5$HK once you leave the terminal the viewing platform is a short walk along the covered walkway and to the right, you cant miss it.This is the perfect opportunity for anyone who wishes to see the skyline but isn't too comfortable with the heights of The Peak.In conclusion....Victoria Harbor offers spectacular views for minimal cost. If heights aren't your thing this is the perfect opportunity. It provides a perfect backdrop for photos and is somewhere you can just pass the time away soaking it all in."

There are multiple ways to experience this.1- Go on the Star Ferry from pier no 7 to TST on the upper deck to experience the beautiful skyline. I personally recommend doing it on both the day time & the evening time.. but if you need to choose - evening time is a Thumbs Up.2- Go to Tamar Park along the Victoria Park. It practically starts from Pier no 7 & goes until Admiralty.3- If you wanna go the $$$$ way, book yourself a table at the Ritz Carlton & get unparalleled views of the Victoria Harbour & 5 star experience4- For a slightly more upmarket experience on the waters of Victoria Harbour - book yourself a seat on the Aqua Luna for a 2 hour long experience of the Harbour & the skyline.

On the Kowloon side of the Harbour there is plenty of pedestrian walking space beside the harbour and traffic free. Of course no visit is complete without crossing the harbour on the iconic Star Ferries. They are possibly the cheapest transport you will ever use. If you want to sit and watch the boat traffic there are plenty of seats and refreshments are close by."

One of the main attractions for visiting Hong Kong, the evening time views of the Victoria Harbour from atop the Victoria Peak are the best. The Victoria harbor is located between the Kowloon peninsula & Hong Kong island. Panoramic views of the harbor from the Hong Kong island side can also be viewed from the IFC Mall & Bank of China building. While, Tsim Tsa Shui promenade, Sky100 of ICC tower offers great views of the harbor from Kowloon side. A ride in the iconic Star Ferry is a must to get a feel of the scenic harbor without which no visit to Hong Kong can be considered complete."

Within ten minutes, you can enjoy the scenery(the skyline) on both sides of the harbour, extremely beautiful at night.

There is a shopping area where you can explore the more expensive stores in HK and a scenic area where you can just chill and take in the view. During the day you can also get on the Star Ferry to enjoy a tour. At night, you can go to the harbour and watch the Symphony of Lights show at 8:00. The show goes on every night unless the weather is bad. It's cool, there's music and a lot the buildings participate in the show. The show is also narrated in English, Cantonese and Putonghua on different days. Even if you go on night where they are speaking a language you don't understand, it's still interesting to watch. The harbour is a great to bring family, friends, and loved ones. You can walk down to the Avenue of Stars and there are bars you can go to as well. Overall, amazing place for pictures and to take in what HK has to offer."

Always active with traffic from local boats to Macau ferries to cruise ships. of course, the best way to enjoy is via Star Ferry, back and forth from Central to TST. but man did they kill a piece of history when they relocated the classic Star Ferry terminal to this modern contraption in front of IFC. you can get a flavor of the old style, though, if you take a ferry from the Sui Sai Wan departure to Kowloon side, though - but it's inconvenient and only worth doing if you're in for a seafood dinner. the harbour is obviously much more choppy and less clean than ever before, but it's at the heart of Hong Kong. find a few ways to experience it if you're in Hong Kong for just a short while, even if it is just dinner with a harbour view."

The morning tour went with a bang. We were the only couple picked up at Star Ferry by the Chinese style tour boat booked via our hotel. The rest of the passengers were teenage Hong Kong school children with their teachers on a \"tourist experience course\" for their studies. While I sneaked off for a can of lager at the back of the boat, my blonde haired partner was suddenly surrounded bya semi circle of dark haired Hong Kong girls all wanting to have \"selfies\" with the blonde tourist while her partner was otherwise distracted. In the meantime - in a possible well planned ambush - I was cornered a the bar by three of the teenage boys who all had excellent English and drilled me with questions including the weather in London.

It is a very deep natural harbor pretty much right up to the shore, piers line both sides of the harbor for freight and passenger liners. Over the years the Hongkong Government keeps \"reclaiming\" land by filling the harbor, selling the land to developers at ever increasing prices. This is a major source of revenue for the government. The harbor of course keeps getting smaller. The recent 20 years also saw an increasing smog problem drifting from the industrial zones of Guangdong Province. November December used to be mostly beautiful clear days... now there are many smogged in ones especially if there is moisture in the air. Still it is nowhere as bad as Beijing or Shanghai where they have heavy industry.Two pictures are posted here, taken respectively in December 2012 and 2013. It has been 5 days of foggy smog so far this December. Don't bother booking the harbor view room ):"

There are some statues on the walkway , and of course a bruce lee statue as a tribute to him.Also you have some nice shops and restaurants on the harbour too"

The meal was really disappointing for the price of the cruise, we couldn't bring ourselves to eat much at all as the food looked unappealing, the place looked tired and rather dirty (which was surprising for Hong Kong), the coffee was lukewarm and the service was non-existent. The band was entertaining and non-stop as the singers took turns. All in all it felt like get them on, get them off, \"next\" type of cruise with little regard for guests."

The sea has become rougher with currents created by numerous vessels plying between Hong Kong side and Kowloon. Best viewing of the harbour and skyline is the promenade in Kowloon side. Wait till the neon signs are on and use a tripod to take a memorable shot of the harbour with the skyline and Victoria Peak as background and the multiple coloured stripes of neon light reflection In the sea to complete a nice photo. Ride on the Star ferry is only HK$2.80 for adults. And it is FREE for anyone aged 65 or above, including non-HK residents."

So it is not surprising that today the harbor and its magnificent buildings display the commerce, power and wealth that typify Hong Kong. The privileged can view Victoria Harbor from the privacy of their villas or hotel rooms from various aspects and angles, but common folks like us can enjoy the view for free from the best aspect of all at Kowloon's East Tsim Sha Tsui promenade. Safe, clean, and open, the promenade faces the Victoria side where bright advertising signs and skyscrapers make the water look like dark blue ink. The glowing cityscape is framed by the dark mass of Mount Victoria and the lights of houses and apartments extending all the way up to the peak (your view is others looking back at you). From left to right in the photo, the vertical sentinels of power and wealth are the Central Plaza (tallest building in HK for more than 10 years). the triangle shapes of architect I.M. Pei's \"sprouting bamboo shoot\" Bank of China Tower (the 4th tallest in HK), and finally the top of Two International Financial Centre showing above one of the promenade lamps at the right of the photo. It\u2019s currently the second-tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong and 8th tallest in the world. The brightest ornaments of commerce to be found in the harbor are the green and white Star Ferries, the red-sailed tourist junk, Aqua Luna, and a Star Cruise ship that usually comes in to port in the mornings and leaves after sunset with its rigging festooned with lights. It would be worthwhile for visitors to linger for moment after nightfall just to take in the sweep of Victoria Harbor and to feel in it the history of Hong Kong as the darling of free market economists all over the world."

Just a short ferry ride that cost around HKD 2 per person on a very old ferry dated from 1960s with views of HK skylines.Sadly, cannot see any of the famous traditional HK boats anymore."

It was only for one hour and raining really hard, so we had to sit inside the ferry and there were times we couldn't see the shore. It was a real pity because there are spectular views to be had. One hour is not enough because, as one of the largest natural harbours in the world, it is a facinating place and we would have liked to have seen the commercial docks, the container terminal, and more generally of the Harbour and it's waterfront. I love poking around harbours and boats, and seeing the working environment and the wide variety of craft from sanpans to ocean ships. The was so much to see, if we could have, that is. So we shall definitely go back but need to find a longer tour which I would guess needs 2 or 3 hours at least."

The best place to view the scenery is from the Tsimshatsui Star Ferry Pier and also getting the experience to take Star Ferry back and forth the Tsimshatsui and Central. Again, weather is the crucial factor if you want to view a clear and beautiful Victoria Harbour. Raining and foggy days will totally spoil your mood, and not to mention we have a lot of air pollution from our mainland these days.

I have lived in Hong Kong for four and half years and the Vicororia Harbour skyline always lifts my mood and makes me feel so happy to live here. My advice is to experience this at different times of the day. Past reviewers advise the cross harbour star ferry which is fantastic value and the views of the harbour from the Peak which are amazing day or night. The Symphony of Lights is a wonderful, if cheesy, way to see the harbour. I never tire of this and will always go when we have visitors, watching either from the viewing platform Kowloon side or from the Star Ferry harbour tour -again great value.I really recommend the views from the ordinary ferries to the outlying islands. These are simplly the best way to experience Hong Kong views. If you are going to Mui Wo (Pier 6) sit on the lower deck in the open area and enjoy the views and the breezes. If you are off to Cheung Chau (Pier 5) splurge and sit out on the open area of the delux deck. I usually take a plastic deck chair from the inside delux cabin and sit comfortably outside and relax. Both ferry trips are wonderful cheap and full of photo opportunities of harbour, boats, ships, tankers and the beautiful islands."

In fact, for us it's the pulse of this metropolis with a flotilla of vessels plying in every direction on water that has changing moods and colours day and night. The looming mountainous backdrop plus the skyline of buildings superimposed along HK Island, Kowloon and beyond are another distinctive aspsect.A lot has been discussed about the reclamation projects shrinking parts of Victoria Harbour and none more noticeable to us then the shortened journey on the Star Ferry between Central and Kowloon. What used to be quite a historically magical journey across the Harbour is more about the length of the walk on reclaimed land from the walkway at Central to the Ferry Pier itself.However, there will always be a stunning Victoria Harbour with walkways awash with people, superlative views from buildings, bridges and peaks, brilliant yearly fireworks and colourful laser shows that light up this sometimes dirty, calm or turbulent, natural waterway!We love it!Enjoy your experience!"

From this side you can see many famous hong kong landmarks: HSBC, IFC, Peak Tower, Star Ferry Pier across the water. Both daytime and nightime have different ambience's so best to go at both times. If you go to the star-ferry pier (get a star ferry boat if u want later) at Tsim Sha Tsui (kowloon) and walk to left of it you can get really good views and there are elevation walkways for viewing. You will also see the remnants of the KCR railway when you see the old clocktower- a reminder of Hong Kong's colonial past. Theres also hk space museum and cultural center around the area. Also a place where many wedding photos are taken (you may see people in wedding clothes)"

For better views, go to the Peak (if it is an unusually clear day) or the IFC.Skip the helicopter tour.

The most spectacular cityscapes at night are from any point on Avenue of the Stars. Hong Kong can have lots of low cloud, so it can take a few nights to get really crisp photos, although when the cloud is very low obscuring the tops of the buildings, very dramatic views are to be had with the neon lights illuminating the clouds and Victoria Harbour. A must is the Star Ferry, it takes about 7 minutes and costs just a few pence. The raised walkways on Hong Kong Island make getting your bearings difficult to start with as the walkways and the streets don't match. Take the upper level on the ferry, access to the ferry is at the centre of the terminal, a different entrance to the lower deck. Automatic ticket, or plastic token, machines are along the walkway to the ferry, the last ferry is about 10 PM"

We recently visited first thing in the morning, around 7.45am and found the crowds tolerable. It was easy to take unobscured photos of the duck at that time of day. The Big Yellow duck will remain at this location until 9 June 2013 for those interested in seeing this temporary attraction before he swims away from Hong Kong for good!"

Well organised and a genuine piece of HK history. On the HK side you can disembark at Central Pier or Wan Chai. On the Kowloon side the areas surrouinding the pier near Nathan Road can get very, very crowded. Toilets are good and eating options are all near by. Great for people watching and photo opportunites. Twice I have been to Hong Kong and both times I have enjoyed the spectacular harbour by day and by night. Potentailly a free visit where you just walk along the promenade. Highly recommended."

To avoid confusion, you must buy the tickets first at street level, on the left (facing the water) or east side and then proceed up the stairs to the boarding waiting area. The boats cycle every hour and depart approximately 10 minutes to the hour. They do not wait so, keep an eye for boarding. Its not overly crowded (when I went) and was excellent for some fresh sea breeze and has a narrative on loud speaker of the attractions and history. Great for a photo shoot.

It's best to visit the Victoria Harbour on the Kowloon side (i.e. in Tsim Sha Tsui), rather than on the Hong Kong island side, as most of the tall buildings and illuminations are on Hong Kong island, it's best to view it from the opposite side of the harbour. During the day you get to see the different massing, scale, heights, textures and colours of all the amazing architecture on HK island, my favourites are the Bank of China building by I.M. Pei, the HSBC building by Norman Foster, as well as the shorter buildings all justapositioned against the taller ones at the back of the island. But one must choose a bright day as the pollutants from mainland China meant that if you visit this place on a cloudy day your vistas will be severly limited. By night you get to see the magnificient illuminations from the external facades, at around 8pm there is a light/music show, all the buildings will be lit and some music will be played in the background explaining the architectural history of HK. The best place to view this free light show is by the Star Ferry terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui."

The Peninsula and YMCA on the Kowloon side used to have an unobstructed view, but now the harbor on both sides has had huge landfills such that the Star Ferry seems a shorter ride, though still the best way to see it close up. At night it's all lit up like Shanghai which I guess is okay if you like lots of tall buildings; the nightly laser light show is mildly interesting but not spectacular. The harbor is still the center of the city and you could watch it for hours, either from the Peak or one of the skyscrapers. Just like the freedoms of the population are being slowly shrunk by the Communist government, the harbor seems somehow diminished. See it before they pave over the whole thing."

It's here that you can see the entire skyline of buildings over the water on Hong Kong island, the harbor with all the boats going across including the Aqua Luna (the old fashioned boat with the traditional red sails that used to be found on ships years ago in Chinese history).  This place is perfect for just relaxing, sitting in one of many benches overlooking the waterfront, and enjoying the setting. Nice for either day or night time enjoyment. In the evening don't forget that there is the routine 10 minute 'Symphony of Lights' running from 8:00 to 8:10 each night. this location, whether during the day or night was heavily visited by many people enjoying the setting along the waterfront."

Despite it being a gloomy day and even sprinkling, the Harbour overlooked the amazing buildings and lights that the view was still perfect. I don't think there is a bad time to visit this place. There were a lot of vendors (about 50 feet of each other) equipped with their SLR cameras and printers ready to snap a photo of you with the grand background. It cost about 20 (Hong Kong dollars) for 2 5x7 prints (different poses) and 4 wallet sizes. Even if you happen to have just a few hours in Hong Kong (if you are just waiting for your connecting flight), leave the airport, take the tram for a few Hong Kong bucks and explore Kowloon and visit the Harbour. Takes about 3-4 hours tops. You'll have enough time to catch your next flight. Do it!"

The cheapest and most practical may be to take the Star Ferry from Tsim Sha Tsui to Central or Wan Chai. It costs about 2.5 HKD per person and only takes about 10-15 minutes at most but the view is spectacular, not to mention the fun of riding on one of the oldest still operating ferry services.If you want to spend more time out on the water, consider an evening dinner cruise or even charter a boat for yourself.

The harbor areas is well maintained to walk along the water and view the spectacular skyline of both Kowloom and across the water on HK Island. Nice stroll and picture taking opportunities. They have a walk of stars where there are hand prints of all the Chinese movie stars and there are kiosks for something to drink. Also museums are in this area. then catch Star Ferry for the quick but fun ride across to HK Island."

If you must know get out and explore it, the ferry is cheap but takes time, but allows for a great view, the MTR goes like every 1 minute, good speed, gets you fast to the other side, but no view. The Light show is on at 8pm every night for about 15 mins. Doesn't matter how many times you watch it, there is always something you didn't see the previous time."

I took the ferry ride like 4 times back and forth on 2 separate evenings just to enjoy the ferry ride and get away from the overly crowded MTR (mass transit railway). If you are staying in a hotel in Kowloon, just take the ferry from Tsim Sha Tsui to Central then go to Victoria Peak to look at Hong Kong skyline at night."

The cherry on the cake is the 10 minute light and sound show named \"Symphony of lights\" which takes place every night at 8:00pm with neon and laser lights from more than 40 tall buildings dancing in perfect harmony with some soothing music. Many would suggest Victoria Peak as the best place to enjoy the harbour view... But, if you really want to be in thick of things then Avenue of Stars located on the Tsim Sha Tsui side of the waterfront is the best place. Grab some delicious street food, take a front row seat of the elevated observation deck and emerge immerse yourself in the magical atmosphere. Taking boat ride across the harbour at night is also highly recommended."

I would recommend people to come during night time. It is pretty amazing to see all the lightings and buildings of Hong Kong Island from the Kowloon side. I don't know if it would be that amazing if you come during the day- time. I also recommend you to take the star ferry that operates between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. It departs right at the Harbour and arrives at Central. It is not only reasonable price. You can also enjoy the view of Victoria Habour from different perspectives. It is pretty different and amazing. Also Star Ferry is the symbol of Hong Kong, it has been operating for over 100 years. It witnesses to the many changes that have taken place in Hong Kong over the years"

The serene waves and the picturesque location is sure to sooth you after a tiring day. It is simply magnificent.

I went directly to Central (on Hong Kong Island) then took the Star Ferry to Kowloon. The panoramas offered on both sides of the harbour are stunning. The harbour front has something for everyone....shopping, eating, culture, and people watching. For a tourist on a limited time budget, positioning the amenities (museums, etc.) so close together showcases great planning. I also enjoyed the wide and expansive walkways to enjoy the views, the water, a leisurely walk and get some much needed exercise. During my visit, the weather was uncooperative. While it was grey or overcast - you could definitely enjoy the buildings lit up for the night, however, it did disrupt the light show. I can only imagine the stunning beauty with a clear blue sky or star lit night. Can't wait to come back and update my review!"

Victoria Harbor is fairly large, but not too large to be nestld between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, the other major part of the city. Both sides have loads of tall (I mean rally tall, one at 118 floors) skycrapers, many with unique architectural features, so they don't look alike at all). The harbor itself is filled with boats, big and small. The view oif the Harbor is awesome day and night. At sunset, you see the skylines change and the lights gently come on. At night it is simply amazing. At 8PM nightly, they put on an amazing show (it's free) called \"Festival of Lights\", where many of the buildings light up and change colors, and then a fantastic laser show begins, where laser beams shoot between buildings and across the harbor! This is all accompanied by a musical score, and everyone should love it. It is of course great for kids, whose fascinated looks were very cute, but also very romantic for couples. I know my wife and I felt that way!All views of the Harbor are great, from the shores, or from your hotel room (if you get a view) or the many hotels on the waterfront that have bars and restaurants with full views. But do NOT miss taking the famous Star Ferry across the Harbor. We took it first during the daytime, and then again at night. The ferries run constantly, and are absurdly cheap (regular far is about 10 cents USA, and if you want \"first class\" on the upper level, it is hardly budget-busting at maybe 25 cents!)You can go back and forth on the ferry and it is a delight in itself!! This, together with Victoria Peak, are the top attractions in Hong Kong, a city of many, many attractions. Do not pass this up!!!"

I returned later in my trip during the early morning hours and the promenade was relatively empty allowing time to appreciate the views in peace and freedom, this is until reaching the avenue of stars to find people queuing to take a picture with bruce lee most notably the tourist bus crowd which ruined the whole ambience and i just wanted to leave the promenade and find the nearest place to escape the crowds again.

We spent quite a few hours visiting the harbour during our three days in Hong Kong prior to the cruise, as we took the ferry from Kowloon to Hong Kong every day. It's a very busy place with many shopping opportunities as well as ferries to Hong Kong and Macau. We were eager to see the light show, but decided to wait until we boarded the cruise ship. Watching it from Deck 9 of ms Amsterdam (Holland America Line) was quite a spectacle!"

Its immensely busy and surrounded by one of the world's great metropolis', but there isn't rubbish in the water and the breezes are heavy with unpleasant odours so prevalent in other SE Asian harbours. I could spend hours just wandering and watching by the waters of Victoria Harbour... Definitely another of Hong Kong's treasures."

The harbour is very busy, tall skyscapers all about, it looks fabulous. Cant rave about it enough, just magic."

I come from Melbourne and we also have a body of water that splits the city, only ours is a little narrower and a lot dirtier! Beautiful city is Hong Kong and the harbour is an integral part of it."

            "review": "The jewel in Hong Kong's crown. Victoria Harbour must certainly qualify as the centre piece of Hong Kong. Apart from the day views of the harbour that are quite spectacular, world-famous are the panoramic night views. Hint 1: among the best places to view the Harbour at night is the Peak Tower on Victoria Peak. The day view is perhaps best from Sky100 International Commerce Centre (ICC). Hint 2: National Geographic Traveler quite justifiably named the Victoria Harbour Star Ferry crossing as one of the 'Top 50 travel experiences of a lifetime'. For HK$ 2.50, take the upper deck on the Central / Tsim Sha Tsui ferry or vice versa - a ten minute ride where you can relax and feel the harbour breeze on your face as the ferry thrums its way across - and before you know it there you are on the other side!Hint 3: Yet another popular if more expensive way of taking in Victoria Harbour during the day, evening or night is on the various harbour cruises on offer - please see the Hong Kong Tourism Board website for specific details.Hint 4: if you are okay to some big spending, one of the best options to do the harbour at night is the Symphony of Lights Dinner Cruise conducted by Harbour Cruise - Bauhinia, which throws in dinner and a live band on board. Departing at 7.30pm, It lasts for about 2 hours and costs about HK$ 440 per head including a 10% service charge. There are lower cost versions, all listed on the HKG Tourism Board's website.Hint 5: Don't miss the Symphony of Lights multimedia display, which takes place at 8pm every night. Listed as the world's largest Light and Sound show by Guinness World Records it uses a combination of colourful lighting, laser beams and searchlights synchronised to music - quite a stunning spectacle. Admission is free. You can see this display from any of the harbour cruises or from the waterfront promenades on either side of Victoria Harbour.Hint 6: Star Ferry's double-decker \"Shining Star\" ferry is a really good recreation of the ferries that sailed across Victoria Harbour in the early 1900s. On board the Shining Star, you can relax in an air conditioned lounge which has a cafe to serve you, or you can choose to take in the breeze on the open deck - or both! At HK$80 per head for the \"Single Ride Day Round Trip Ticket\", the one hour long Star Ferry Harbour Tour is good value for money, an unforgettable experience and offers some great harbour views - hard to beat.Hint 7: I recommend the Star Ferry Harbour Tour that leaves Central Pier at 5.15pm - this departure time gives you a great combination of seeing the harbour transform from daylight through evening to dusk - certainly a novel experience.No exaggeration this - Victoria Harbour is definitely the jewel in Hong Kong's crown."

It is worth the trip to go from Hong Kong Island and get off at Tst on the Kowloon side and visit the 1881 heritage area if you scenery and photo ops. If you enjoy fireworks then check out the evening daily show known as the \"Symphony of Lights\" that is set against the skyline. The show holds a Guinness World record for the world's largest permanent light and sounds show. It is also located on the Kowloon side. A good vantage point is the avenue of stars.

The Star Ferry is shuttling the harbor from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon via different landing places. A trip takes around 10 minutes and costs around 4 HKD. You can use the Octopus Card as well. The best place to spot the harbour is Tsim Sha Tsui promenade, especially at night it's simply amazing. At 8 pm there the \"Symphony of Lights\", a lightshow illuminating the skyscrapers on Hong Kong Island."

It is an astonishing spectacle, especially seen at night from the deck of a \"Star\" ferry on the way to Kowloon. Buildings that appear to be stealing the sky compete with each other to offer a light show of startling audacity, with the Bank of China building eclipsing all others. It is mesmerising and night photography becomes possible because of the intensity of reflected light off the surface of the ink-black harbour waters. Kowloon harbourside is thronged with sight-seers until very late in the evening creating thew impression you are part of one of the biggest and best FREE shows in the world. Unmissable and unforgettable"

We took a 4 hour boat ride around the harbor, coasted along Kowloon and HK Isle sides. We saw the sun set and the lights come on, seeing both day/night views. The light show is @ 8pm daily and was neat, but best to view on a cloudy day, so the clouds are the backdrop to the bright lights. The actual viewing platform is on the TST Kowloon side, but you can see the show from anywhere, especially up high."

They keep filling-in the Harbour with ugly roads and buildings, with ZERO consideration for the beauty and enjoyment of the people of Hong Kong or tourists. If you visit any city from Singapore to Sydney, the governments are beautifying the riverfronts and harbours with boardwalks, greenery, parks and restaurants. The HK government have just busied themselves making Victoria Harbour the worlds busiest construction site. Shame on them"

A highlight on Victoria Harbour .... For Sure.Where in the world can you get such a stunning experience for free? There is obviously somewhere else but I \u2018m still to find it!I missed this extravaganza on my first visit to Hong Kong in January so I\u2019d made up my mind that on my return stopover, in February, I\u2019d make it a \u2018\u2019must see\u2019\u2019. I strolled along Victoria Harbour as the light was fading, saw a modern-day reconstruction of an old Chinese Junk ship taking a huge party of business people out for a sail on this stunning harbour which is surrounded by massive, interesting shaped sky-scrapers.This is a good time to visit the harbour because you get daylight, then twilight leading into darkness so you see the harbour in many different roles, activities and photo opportunities.Eating was high on my agenda, there was not as many eateries/pub/cafes along here as I expected but I did find a light snack place so sat and watched the pedestrians and the shipping/tourist boats go by. This was really satisfying after a long day roaming around and touring the interesting/vibrant things Hong Kong has to offer.Victoria Harbour is huge but to get the best out of it, go to the waterfront, near the bus depot, there is a board-walk type of access-way, it\u2019s long and holds lots of your interest as you walk along: there\u2019s a movie theme in statues for you to take your photo by, a well set out garden, unusual craft and lots of ferries moving between both sides of the sea.A bonus for me was a cruise ship coming up the harbour, fully lit up in all its glory. Wow, was it a real treat; one of those travel moments when you realise you just cannot plan every detail which pleases you. Unexpected moments can be so memorable. What a thrill this was.Victoria Harbour is stunning no matter which side of the water you view it \u2013 especially at night.I\u2019d heard lots about the Symphony of Lights, organised and presented by the Hong Kong Tourism Board but nothing could prepare me for the wonder I experienced for 20 mins, from 8 o\u2019clock that February night.On our side, many thousands had gathered and above the music their shrieks of delight just added to the magic.Choreographed to the music, massive buildings had light shows emblazoned on them, lazer beams struck out across the harbour and special lighting sequences were shot onto massive buildings, all along the harbour-side.Victoria harbour is a picture, whether you see it in daytime or night, from the waterfront or high above on Victoria Peak, get the most out of this amazing point on our globe \u2013 go soon and experience the huge harbour for yourself. It is free, it is amazing, it is well worth your time when staying in Hong Kong."

Some traditional sampas against a backdrop of high buildings. You watch the boats and ferries sail, as you contemplate all the ecclectic structures. Old buildings next to tall new ones, It is worth waiting for all the lights from the different building to lit, and take photos of the same scenery as the lights start lighting the bay with different colours.

If you begin your trip on the Hong Kong Island side, beware of hawkers who want to sell you electronics, tailored clothing, etc. I do not advise purchasing cameras and watches on the Kowloon side - it's just a scam. Buy cameras in your home country where they can be serviced! I've lived in Hong Kong 18 years and you can get much better prices at the large wholesale shops in the U.S. if that's where're you from."

Subway is faster, but it is much easier with the ferry."

It's worth it to visit the little souvenir store and just buy something. A lot of the stuff was quite cute and decently priced.

My low rating is aimed at the bureaucrats and others who would like nothing more than to fill it in altogether. Given that land reclamation started almost as soon as the British colonised Hong Kong in the 1840s--and with good reason, there was no flat land--it startles visitors to see where the original waterfront was, under the Court of Final Appeal Building, compared to where it is now. For some years we have been able to stand on the bridge linking Central to the Star ferry and watch various stages of reclamation, dredging, filling-in, building, and so on. What's evident is that the common person has very little place in this scenario. Ocean Terminal can still handle some cruise ships, but not the biggest ones. At an average depth of only 40', the days of Queen this-and-that sailing through are over, and the red-sailed junks are also gone. The view of the harbour from Victoria Peak remains one of the world's greatest harbour views, assuming it can be seen through (variously) clouds, fog, or air pollution. A Cross-Harbour swimming race was just re-introduced after being suspended in 1979 due to pollution, and we did not hear of anyone getting sick after the recent event. That is very good news indeed, if it's true. So my rating does not reflect the harbour itself, which has always been one of Hong Kong's strongest visual selling points, as it does the stresses and changes it is being subjected to."

            "review": "Perhaps the World\u2019s Finest. We live in Hong Kong and naturally have bias towards Victoria Harbor. However, having visited most of the world\u2019s famous harbors, we have come to believe that the Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong is the worlds finest. This is due to a number of reasons. First, Victoria Harbor boosts the Hong Kong skyline which is one of the world's truly remarkable skylines, only rivaled by that of the NYC. Second, there are several famous locations by which you can view and enjoy your time on Victoria Harbor and to top this off, each year, Victoria hosts one of the world\u2019s greatest, 23-minute fireworks displays each Chinese New Year. This is why we feel that Victoria Harbor can arguably stake claim to be the world\u2019s best. So where should you go to see Victoria Harbour? Taking a harbour cruise or just making a single crossing is a favourite way to visit Victoria Harbour and there is no better way to do this then by taking a ride on the historic and iconic Star Ferry which ferries passengers between TST (Kowloon) and Central (HK Island) and Wan Chai (HK Island) for the pocket change price of HK$2.50 (US$0.32) per adult, HK$1.50 (US$0.19) per child. We often say, that for a family of four, this may be the best US$1.00 value for money attraction you will ever find. In addition to cruising the harbour with the Star Ferry, there is another popular junk boat, called the Aqua Luna, which plies the waters of Victoria Harbour. This is a more atmospheric (and pricey) means for taking to the water. Our second favorite place to view the harbor is from the world famous Victoria Peak on HK Island. This is the first of our two Classic Hong Kong postcard locations. From this vantage point, visitors can appreciate the vast size of the harbor while admiring its formation, water traffic and beauty. Best pictures are made on clear sky days with the sun at your back or pretty much every night when the skyline is lit up against the darkness of night. Traditionally, the favorite means for visiting Victoria Peak is by taking the equally famous and historically important Peak Tram found at the Peak Tram Terminus in the Central District of Hong Kong Island. A relatively new and promising attraction that offers cloud level views of Victoria Harbor is the Sky 100 Observation platform on the 100th floor of the ICC building in Tsim Sha Tsui. Like the Empire State Building and Rockefeller Centre in NYC, Hong Kong now has a place to view Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong Skyline from way up in the skies. Our third favorite location for viewing Victoria Harbor is ground level on the Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) Promenade on the Kowloon side. This is another classic postcard location for your picture taking interests, especially at night time with the Hong Kong Skyline is let up and reflecting off the surface of the harbor. This is also the best place, along with the Avenue of Stars, which is a popular area on the TST Promenade, to be when it\u2019s the Chinese New Year fireworks display is taking place. Another popular activity is to watch the Symphony of Lights laser show that takes place at 8pm each night on Victoria Harbor. From the Ave. of Stars, you can hear a program that accompanies the laser show. Bars, Food and \u2018High Tea\u2019 with Views of Victoria Harbor?From Kowloon, you can also enjoy excellent views of the Victoria Harbor from several bars on high floors; such as the popular Aqua Bar (30/fl of Peking One Road) Sky bar (118th/fl) at the International Commerce Center (ICC). Other popular Kowloon based viewing areas include Felix Bar at the famous Peninsula Hotel as well as the lobby and restaurants at the Intercontinental Hotel and the Peking Garden Restaurant in the Star House, across from the Star Ferry Pier. As a helpful hint, if dining at Peking Garden, if you are a large (5+ party) and ask for a window view table when you make reservations, they usually oblige.Another popular activity that can be done near Victoria Harbor is taking traditional \u2018Afternoon High Tea\u2019. First this can be done at the iconic Peninsula Hotel Lobby, just across the street from the TST Promenade on Victoria Harbor. This is a very popular attraction for visitors and HK residents alike however it doesn\u2019t come cheap. An alternative is the Lobby Lounge at the Intercontinental Hotel with direct views of the harbour, an outstanding location for High Tea if the weather is nice and many feel the \u2018High Tea\u2019 experience here is even better. For coffee drinkers, there is an Starbucks with two levels of outdoor seating on the TST promenade offering views of the harbor. This location is surprisingly quite in the morning but can be quite busy in the afternoon and evening when the harbor laser show, symphony of lights is about to start. What can I do near Victoria Harbor? Along the TST Promenade and Avenue of Stars there are quite a few additional attractions you might be interested in seeing. These include the Bruce Lee Statue and the historic Clock Tower. On the museum and cultural front you can visit the Hong Kong Space Museum as well as the Hong Kong Cultural Centre for performancesAlso, there is quality shopping all around the Victoria Harbor. On the Kowloon side, the high end 1881 Heritage shopping mall is directly across Salisbury Rd. near the Peninsula. At the end of the TST promenade near the Star Ferry Pier, you will Hong Kong's largest shopping mall in Hong Kong called Harbor City. Also, on the Hong Kong side, the IFC Shopping Mall is located five minutes walk from the Star Ferry (Central) pier. Lastly, perhaps the best place to get tourist information about Hong Kong can be found at the Star Ferry Pier on the TST side of Victoria Harbour. Here you can load up on maps, brochures and information or talk to tourism board representatives, fluent in English, Cantonese and Mandarin about anything you want related to visiting Hong Kong."

It will not fail to please and soothe you.Because it is at night it is not dependant upon Sun (H K was cloudy when we were there in Jan 2012).Even if it is raining lightly and it was, we sat in a sheltered part of the boat and the light Show \"Called Symphony of Lights Tour\" takes place between 8 - 8.30 pm we were still OK because the symphony of lights is timed to represent the music playing on the boat. It is a light sabre show off various buildings on hong kong island. The 1.5 cruise runs an open bar and most travel agents can book it. If you are running out of money go to the harbour walk running north east from The Kowloon terminal star ferry but you will not get the syncopated music, the drink and the swaying action of the boat. You can also see this from the Peak but not sure if the tram runs that late. However at the Peak you are behind the buildings and the effect is not as good. When you come back at 9.30 you can go from Pier 9 to the adjoining Star Ferry cruise just to cross there and back for fun by night. However the pick up for the cruise proper is 7.30pm at Hong Kong Island Pier 9 (be prompt) and 7.45 on the Kowloon side not near the star ferry so check details of pick up on the internet. Return to Kowloon side for disembarkation at 8.45pm and Pier 9 Honk Kong side at 9pm. This trip makes you responsible to get to the embarkation point under your own means. We took a taxi on the H K side and by 7pm the chronic traffic congestion is dying down making the taxi journey inexpensive. Ensure he turns on the meter though and if he does not insist he does.Such Fun for all ages and you will not get drunk in 1.5 hours of an open bar onboard as you spend you time sitting around the edge of the boat marvelling at the beauty of the night lights. I noticed toddlers could get over and through hand rails so best to arrange a baby sitter for this trip.Chris, Anna & Jordan."

Don't be fooled. Refreshments was a bag of potatoe chips. My grandson askes for a lemonade and was given a half can, poured into a glass. I asked for a coffee and was given a coffee with milk from a can! Hong Kong is so much better than this tour. My advice is don't waste your money.

The water was so full of pollutants at one point that maybe you could have just walked across, and although it's reportedly a bit cleaner now, if you watch some of the anglers down by the ferry piers, the most healthy things they seem to catch are either dead fish or old shoes. Oh well.The harbour isn't much of an attraction in itself, unless you like watching ferries ply their daily trade / junks bobbing up and down / the occasional passing cruise liner. However, it's fun to float around on in the evenings and watch the light show - but that's the light show you're watching, not a body of rather dirty water."

For the Symphony of Lights, the narration can be heard on FM 103.4 , so just set your mobile phone (you don't even need a smartphone or i-phone), or at the Avenue of the Stars (English, every night) or the Convention and Exhibition Centre (English Mon/Wed/Fri)."

Our party had booked a boat for a two hour cruise from the Star Ferry jetty, up the waterfront a way and finally over to the International Conference centre on HK Island. We got there about half an hour before dusk, piled aboard as the boat pushed off into quite a big swell - made worse by the wake of some pretty big vessels passing. I'm a sailor anyway so am fine with the motion of the boat but unless you are a sailor, consider accepting a couple of sea-sickness pills from the crew just to be on the safe side. We pitched and rocked out into the harbour as I marvelled at how low the guard rails on this boat were. The perfect height, in fact, to pitch an adult European over the side with ease. If you're on a similar boat, be careful.Our boat chugged up the harbour front and I just sat back and took in the sights as the light faded and all the city's lights blazed brighter and brighter. Our tour provided drinks and food and moored up for a while further up the harbour to allow people to eat and socialise in calm water while taking in the warm, humid air and the views.After a while, we motored back towards the Conference Centre tower in darkness getting a really spectacular look at the lights as we went. Well worth doing, and surprisingly relaxing too."

There are plenty of places to sit and eat (IFC Mall on Hong Kong Island or the many eateries around the Star Ferry Pier in Kowloon), here you can enjoy the weather and atmosphere that only Hong Kong can give. I and my fiance' was on the observation deck of the IFC Mall, there we enjoyed the warm breeze and the constant flow of water craft (many different types). If sitting on land doesn't excite you, take a trip on the Star Ferry, this will rock your socks off. I enjoy Hong Kong for its' multiplicity, and its' harbour is a must do. Mmmmm....what a place."

Harbor of Aroma is what \u201cHong Kong\u201d means in Cantonese and Victoria Harbor has done an excellent job to make the city significantly proud of its own moniker. Vast and dazzling in day and night, the harbor represents heartbeat of a dynamic Hong Kong in light of commerce, transportation and entertainment. On 2 banks along the harbor stand myriad skyscrapers wherein daily financial activities and shopping spree take place. From the very place, ferries and boats depart almost every minute towards neighborhood islands including Macao, Lantau Island and even islands of China Mainland. However, tourists may most love the harbor for panoramic view when strolling on Tsim Sha Tsui or Central site to enjoy the show of light by night. Even with one day in Hong Kong, do manage a visit to Victoria Harbor for pictures."

In the day, watch the many boats go by, some with local fishermen, others giving tourists a close-up view of the harbour itself. For a great visit both day or night, take the Star Ferry across, very reasonable and frequent. There are many benches located around the area where you can sit and watch.

Remarkably tranquil at daytime and most stunningly romantic at night when the state-of-the-art multimedia lights and sound show starts around 8PM. We've been to HK few times but we can't get enough of this place. Oh by the way, nearby, you would also see other attractions like Hong Kong's famous Clock Tower, Avenue of Stars and Star Ferry Station for crossing each side of the island vice versa and experience a unique ride of a lifetime for only HK$2.20. One can take a lot of gorgeous photos here as the scenic view is incredibly beautiful!!!"

We also travelled on MTR which is very easy to navigate. Hong Kong Island looks like a business district from the Kowloon side but well worth a visit. When you get into the heart of the island there is a lot to see and do. The tram is a novelty must and a great way to see the sights. The Peak is also another must. We also enjoyed a bus tour to Aberdeen, Repulse Bay and Stanley which had great views along the way."

It's the Highway of Hong Kong, full of every type of ocean going vessel from sampan and junks, to tugs, barges and ocean liners! The best way to see this harbour is on the Promenade at Tsim Sha Tsui / Kowloon, from one of the waterfront hotels or from the iconic Star Ferry. However many times you cross the harbour by the star ferry you won't get sick of it. With a bit of preplanning you can get yourself an Octopus Card (from the customer service at the Metro stations) for a small amount, and this saves having to pay coins for your public transport, includig the ferries. they're great. Take a cruise, a night time one, on the Star Ferry, for one hour. They're cheap and fun, and you'll get a drink and a piece of cake while you cruise around looking at the wonderful city lights. if you choose the 8.00 cruise, you'll see the Symphony of Lights which is a laser light show from the tops of some of the main HK buildings. Not a spectacular show, but the Hong Kong buildings and harbour make it really special and worth doing for the peanuts the cruise costs.Make sure you look around both the Star Ferry wharves, in Central and in Kowloon, they're interesting. The best view of the harbour is probably from Victoria Peak, don't miss it."

But each time we visit HK, there are two restaurants we will go in central, TSIM CHAI KEE Noodle located at 98 Wellington St, and another location at 153 Queens Road Central, serves only Won Ton Noodle soup, each bowl have three big won tons filled with whole shrimps and minced pork in a very tasty broth with thin noodles, all for just $18HKD per bowl, it must be the cheapest eat in Central. The restaurant is not big, the chairs are benches without backs, people come here just to eat the won ton noodle and leave, this is not a place to sit , chat or relax. Just to grab a quick bite. Avoid lunch time during the work week you can find a table without waiting too long.Another restaurant in central is JIMMY'S KITCHEN, located left of the Coach handbag store in Central. There are a number of signature items on the menu, but the best is the roast pork knuckle. It is the best, with crispy skin on the outside and moist juicy meat inside. This restaurant's decor is like an English pub with dark wood panels and red color seats. It has been around since 1925. Three course meal averages $35-50 USD with drink.For souvenir shopping in Central, go to Li Yuen East and Li Yuen West Street, it's two streets next to each other filled with shops and stalls of souvenirs. Do bargain with the street vendors, it can be fun."

It is different from each side so well worth a look. On the Kowloon side they also have an audio commentary, it is in English every third night, so make sure you time your visit with it.The harbour is also lovely by day, the star ferry is the best and a cheap way to get across, you can use your octopus card. We found it much cheaper than a taxi and more pleasurable than the train. Some excellent photographic opportunities.The star ferry run a one hour cruise, well worth a look.

The view was wonderful and the air was clean and refreshing. Perfect location to see the nightly light show.There was a large crowd of tourists but not so crowded that you can't move around freely. The light show was not that spectacular - I expected many buildings to participate but that wasn't the case. Nonetheless, the HK skyline is amazing. The MTR station is close by, transportation is not a problem.I recommend to stay an hour here at night."

However, having scene many of the world's best harbors and having been to over 70 countries I do feel like this is one of the very best on offer, especially at night time. I recommend walking the Avenue of Stars at nighttime when the Hong Kong island side is fully lit with bright lights. Also, you can take boat ride, Aqua Luna is a good way to go and ride down Victoria harbor at night time. During the day, the harbor view is a hit or miss. If the air pollution is bad, its not very good. If there is clear sky, its fantastic. There are many good restaurants, Starbucks type shops and photo stops along the harbor on the Tsim Sha Tsui (TST - MTR stop) side. I also recommend walking the harbor on the TST side early in the morning prior to the tourist group arrivals. Its is pleasantly quite and almost empty of people before 7.30am. Once the tourists arrive, it fills up, quickly and is pretty much busy for the rest of the day. From the Hong Kong island side, Victoria harbor is best viewed from the PEAK where you get the world famous view of TST side of the harbor. Again, this is best done at night time when you get the real perspective of the size, scale and glamour of Hong Kong. The view is much different than from the TST side viewing of Hong Kong island so I recommend doing both. Again, lots of dining options at the PEAK or down below closer to the water so make a nice evening of the harbor when visiting Hong Kong."
