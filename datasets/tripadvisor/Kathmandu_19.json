However, the old people and business are driven away by the more competitive shops and business leaving a very commercial place without soul. By the way, it is always the unreplacable centre of Kathmandu. Just go there to have a look if you are not living there."

Walking through the streets you see glorious fabrics everywhere, not only hanging from shop awnings, but worn by the people. Incense burns, chanting, kids playing, cars, bikes and so much more. You look past the uneven paths, or lack of them, the noise, smell of cars, and you feel the beautiful peace of the people. We found 2 book shops. In one my granddaughter didn't want to leave the selection of books she loved and in the other, the Tibetan owner spent time and taught me about singing bowls."

It's filled with shops, restaurants bars and hotels. Yet the roads here are too narrow to accommodate all the traffic; tourists, locals, street sellers and cars. The motorbikes speed through as fast as possible, nearly knocking down everyone in sight. Their horns pressed down loud and long, resulting in angry aggressive streets. The Nepalese are the nicest people in the world, but put them on a bike and all they care about is getting from A to B - if you're in the way you have to jump in the gutter or risk getting hit. This area could be a wonderful place to browse, shop and spend yet the traffic is relentless. It\u2019s a horror. I have seen many tourists look uncomfortable and distressed when almost rammed by a bike. I wonder why there's no traffic management, maybe a speed limit and a ban of horns. It's not impossible to implement?"

It is infuriatingly chaotic and senses are assaulted from all directions. Loud, smelly, dirty, crowded, polluted, traffic clogged..you name it and there is a word for it. Also, although invisible to the naked eye, as a tourist, you have a sign over your head that says 'ATM'. Because that is what you are to the locals, a source of income to be tapped at every opportunity be it for Tiger Balm, tips, drugs (too many around for my liking) and those annoying students who appear from nowhere wishing to make friends with you, show you around and take you for all you can afford. Expect also, power cuts and water shortages on a regular basis. The paradox, however, is that you will find accommodation that suits every budget. Food that sort of impersonates that of which you get at home, travel agents, trekking gear shops, Thanka shops, dodgy jewellery sellers, passable coffee, supermarkets and pharmacies that will sell you antibiotics without prescriptions."

As a newish visitor to Kathmandu (3 visits), I don't know much about the town, so tend to remain close to the hotel and surrounding areas. I've been to Thamel once before, which is basically a popular downtown type area, loaded with stores, bars and restaurants. It is also famous for shady joints like dance bars and massage parlours. Nothing wrong with then unless you have an ethical issue - to each their own. I encountered a young man by the name of Tinjin, who was a shortish fellow about 19-20 years old and very impressive Hindi/Urdu. Seemed to know his way around and ended up taking me to a bar called the 'pussycat' club. Shady as it sounds, it was a half decent but dirty as hell joint. Said his 'brother' owned it and he'd get me a nice discount. I wasn't counting on that, but figured a Simon night out and a few drinks wouldn't cost more than 3-4k Nepali rupees. Long story short, he told me the bill would be 2500, took the cash, went to the bar to pay and took too long. I went over, asked for the bill - which was bow 5,500. He insisted we have a tequila shot on the house and we could leave for another venue. I got annoyed, went out for a smoke and while the bar staff kept me busy discussing a revised bill of 7,500 - Tinjin slipped out beyond me, money in hand and his bar buddies then stuck me with the entire bill saying he isn't their staff and it's my problem now. Ended up withdrawing cash with a credit card (you know those bank fees) because I had had enough arguing my way around this. Be very careful and don't trust the locals in Thamel. Period."

However once you do careful research before choosing the tour company and one should be aware that most of the gear are knock-offs. That said though you can still find something suitable if you need to do your trek. For example, I've had a lot of bad luck with boots. I take boots from an errand region to a tropical region and within a couple of years the glue will disintegrate or the rubber will disintegrate in the boots become worthless this is exactly what happened to me when I arrived in Kathmandu. This is a serious problem for me since I'm 6'3\" and wear size 13 boots not an easy size to find. I went into the Northface shop and bought a pair of shoes or boots and they worked fine as I slogged it up to ABC in the monsoon season."

We realised later that his card was actually debited the two times he tried and other transactions had since been made on his card. So, we had to block his card to avoid anymore misuse. The ATM we used was one similar to any of the other ATMs on the street. So if you need money I would recommend having a daily budget and exchanging on site your foreign currency (they have many foreign money exchange on Thamel with better exchange rates than at the airport or hotels).

We booked them with a touristic agency in Thamel. First day: private tour to Patan and Bhaktapur: 60 usd 2 people.Second day: group tour to main manasteries/temples and main square: pashupatinath, budhanilkantha, Boudhanath, kathmandu durbar square, swayambhunath. 20 usd 2 people. Third: group tour, river rafting.60 usd 2 people. Fourth: shopping in Thamel and massageFifth: Kopan monastery and durbar square. Sixth: relax + flight back. It is important that whenever they offer you an itinerary you asked them as much details as possible. Example: if they tell you that you will be picked up from your hotel/Hostal you clarify if it will be done by car or someone will come walking and that will be your \"pick up\" -that happened to us-If they hired you a taxi for sightseeing ask if they will use a/c or not. We got cases were no a/c was used, and it was hot! Also how long they will wait you in each sightseeing. Taxis around KTM should be less than 500 rs. 500 rs can be from Thamel to Kopan Monastery which is around 15 km. Also, most of this touristic agency are kind of brokers. They will simply add you to a bigger group.Kathmandu people is friendly but ensure you bargain. A bottle of water can be 20 rs (tourist standar) probably for the locals is 10 rs. If they feel you are coming from a wealthy county it can be 40 rs so.. This apply for everything you buy or service you want. In KTM some roads are full of dust or simply are dust so you will see a lot of locals wearing mask. If you suffer from respiratory illness, get a mask.Food is very good we looked for the top 10 restaurant in trip advisor and we found very good restaurants. 1000 rs standard budget for this kind of restaurants.We stayed at Avalon house KTM, place was great. Enjoy!"

Whilst ever tourist that lands at Katmandu airport more than likely ends up in Thamel, it takes a day or so of wandering around to realise that beyond the shops and the touts wanting to sell you anything, the side pictures of this area are the things I enjoy the most. I love going down the narrow streets and laneways, getting glimpses of the locals life's as they go about their daily routine. Colour ,sights and smells greet your senses as you discover things such as the old English cemetery, the numerous mini temples ,statues and location stores, selling what they need , not what we want.Some of my favourite images are from these walks and each time I go back and show new people this part of Thamel.Of corse if you just want to shop then Thamel is the place for you. Look , price and compared and when you decide on what you want, haggle for a better price but remember to be respectful. If you can't find common ground then move on saying thank you.Thamel has no end of places to eat , be careful of the hidden cost, the tax they add on after so always look to see if it included in the price or an add on.For me Thamel is a great place to recover from the rigours of the trek that you have just finished, but Igor me 2-3 days is about all I can do. Other places beckon if I've got more time. "

There are tons of bars, restaurants, and tourist knick knack shops. I think it's safe to say that everything in Thamel is more expensive than nearly anywhere else in Nepal, simply because its main audience is tourists and they are always busy. Definitely check it out. If you're in Thamel, go to Mandala Street. It's a no driving street so it's a lot less busy."

It\u00b4s very practical to stay there as you can find most of the shops with maps, outdoor gear, books and other things you might need for the trip there. I would really advice people to also visit other parts of Kathmandu though as you can otherwise come away with the impression that Kathmandu is just one big tourist place and it is not at all. Many parts of Kathmandu sees very few foreigners and these parts are nice to visit too even if they have less cafes than Thamel."

Thamel has been the center of the tourist industry in Kathmandu for over four decades, starting from the hippie days when many artists came to Nepal and spent weeks in Thamel. Even though Thamel has been referred to as a \"ghetto\" by some, many low-budget travellers consider it a hotspot for tourism.Country NepalCity KathmanduLanguage Official NepaliTime Zone Nepal Time Zone (UTC+05:45)Co-ordinates 27.714771, 85.311391Thamel is distinguished by its narrow alleys crowded with various shops and vendors. Commonly sold goods include food, fresh vegetables/fruits, pastries, trekking gear, walking gear, music, DVDs, handicrafts, souvenirs, woolens, clothes. Travel agencies, small grocery stores, budget hotels and restaurants also line the streets. Cars, cycles rickshaws, two-wheelers and taxis ply these narrow streets alongside hundreds of pedestrians.There are many restaurants in Thamel that serve traditional and continental cuisine, although prices are significantly higher than in non-tourist areas. Thamel also acts as the pre-base camp for mountaineers. It boasts a wide range of mountaineering gear shops, foreign money exchange booths, mobile phone shops, pubs, clubs, and nightlife along with the numerous travel agents and guest houses. Thamel is home to a wide range of the Nepalese population, and serves both entertainment and employment purposes.Source: WIKIPEDIA"

I was amazed to see \"100% Pashminas\" hanging in the streets and piled high on the shelves in the shops. Tons of brass Buddhas and prayer wheels. Reams of craft made paper and thousands of Thankas and greeting cards. Restaurants and clubs were mostly western style or fusion. I found some interesting and some left me wondering if I were, indeed, in a foreign country. Hotels have grown in profusion. I chose not to visit bars that offered dancing.Pilgrims Book House is cavernous and a great place to sit out the rains.Thamel, in my opinion, is just a place to find reasonable accommodation at a reasonable price. It is also a good base to arrange tours from. I thought it lacked charm, although there were places of interest hidden in courtyards (cafes, temples etc).

It's a little less overwhelming for westerners than the authentic local markets which are even dirtier and more chaotic. Housing ranges from hostels to fairly nice boutique hotels.

I suggest taking a look around first, but you won't have to go far if you're looking for one of the above things. Haggle, haggle, haggle, and don't pay over 1/3 to 1/4 of the original price. Multiple items will get a deeper discount, although I likes giving by business to multiple shops rather than one. It's a unique experience if you're new to Asia, be prepared to be overwhelmed and your senses entertained. Bring water, and enjoy the experience."

It's perplexing because the greeting of spices and fragrances were with us on our ENTIRE trip - we didn't much get a whiff of sewerage/trash! The vendors are mostly lovely and they welcome a good haggle (though the prices were always very inexpensive for us). When eating/purchasing services, we recommend you tip (around 10%), unless the bill already contains a \"service charge\" (not \"VAT\", that's not a tip).Rickshaws are great, especially at night visiting the markets till 10pm, though not for the faint-hearted because many roads are cobble-stoned. Agree on the price before the ride, else just say 'no thank you' and walk away; and check if it's per person or total. Add a NRP200 tip if it was a good ride.We walked most of the time to get around and it was a better way to experience the culture first-hand. Google Maps worked amazingly, and we downloaded the Google map so we can access it offline, but almost every eatery/restaurant had wifi anyway. To be respectful of Asian dress standards, we always wore t-shirts and I wore my newly purchased yoga pants, to cover up our shoulders and legs.When choosing the local cuisine, try 'Dal Bhat' - it's Nepal's staple meal of rice, lentil soup with coriander and spices, and a dry curry of potatoes, onions, tomatoes and legumes. Nepalis eat this sometimes twice per day. \"Full battery\", my local friends call it. So yummy :):):)We recommend staying at Tibet Peace Inn, getting your groceries at the Shop Right Supermarket, eating at the Electric Pagoda, refilling your bottles at KEEP (behind Kilroy's) and buying goods from co-op vendors. We loved the Local Women's Handicrafts on Paknajol Marg, which is what it's called in Google Maps but the shopfront says 'Handmade Products by Women's Group'. It's a social enterprise whereby they train the local women in handicraft skills, sell their works in-store (clothes, purses/bags, jewellery), and the money goes back to them, like a wage. Inspired! Thamel is the best for shopping, better value than Bhaktapur.Don't just stay in Thamel, however! Book a trek around Kathmandu, or if you're brave, to Basecamp!"

Althought it's in the heart of the capital but the resturant,bar,caffee,lounge etc have the different rates and different services. In my personal experience the the palce is awesome for the party and the dance lover and most of all for the die hard live music lover. My suggestion would be that get in the thamel at 7pm and have a full stomach meal a thakali meal its really cheap and head toward the bar which doesn't charge the entry fee and have a love music and order some snacks and a beer tower if you are with friends, by doing that you would have a budget and the awesome weekend at thamel."

Detailed resum\u00e9 below:As far as bideshi/foreigners go, Thamel is a mass intersection of folk arriving or leaving for elsewhere, and all too often, looking for some pleasure in-between. Evidently, the swathes of foreigners, and restaurants catering to them, attracts many young Nepalis and vendors looking for business. There are, as anywhere in the world, some wonderful folk, alongside some of the sketchiest, desperate characters I've ever met. I had the strange pleasure of being here for a long time for a research project, meaning I saw the different waves of tourists and their diversity, as tourist-season ended in Nepal around late-May.If you are white and under 30, you will be approached for \"Hash, weed, SHMOKE\" (there seems a method using the lower jaw to push out the word) or for Tiger Balm, or to buy various trinkets.Often, vendors will not know what \"No\" means. One must, however, keep in mind that it is the previous types of tourists that have conditioned locals to ask other foreigners for these things (i.e. amongst the pot-smoking tourists, I also witnessed a young European couple shooting up heroine in public in the early evening... the effect a sight like this has on local Nepalis is unfortunate)."

Its quite easy and safe to navigate during the day, with lots of shops and places to eat (yummy bakeries and coffee shops!). The only real danger is the cars, motorcycles and rickshaws swerving around you. If you plan on trekking and forgot something at home, you can find almost anything for colder weather in the shops here (as well as in the true North Face stores, not knockoffs) and rent some equipment too. Lots of places to do same-day or next-day laundry for a reasonable price. Finally, lots of places to take out or exchange money."

The place is chaotic and totally crazy but absolutely brilliant. The streets are are small and lined with shop after shop so do your shopping here. The traders have suffered with the drop in tourist numbers due to the quake so they are keen to make the best deal for you. There are plenty of bars and places to eat (Thamel House Restaurant is my favorite!) If you are keen for a trek or experience and haven't organised anything go see Prem from \"Ace the Himalaya\"....his prices are extremely competitive and their guides are fantastic (felt very safe with them and they knew their stuff....told us where to go for best deals and what to watch out for).....We stayed in Thamel which was a great decision as I would have been disappointed if I stayed anywhere else as this was the place to be."

It's a lively place with shops and some nice places to eat or grab a coffee (Rosemary, Sum Cafe). Some of the streets are very narrow, and all are busy with both pedestrians and traffic. While there are a lot of shops many do seem to sell the same things, so eventually you end up just window shopping. I'd recommend something to cover your nose and mouth as the streets can get very dusty and clogged with vehicles. Would make a good walk between the Garden of Dreams and Kathmandu Durbar Square if you don't mind walking with taxis, mopeds, rickshaws and people coming at you from every angle."

Walk south to the main Bazaar and Durbar Square, but along the way stop briefly at the small square (on your right-hand side walking south) housing the Shree Gha stupa and the Drubgon Jangchup Choeling Buddhist Monastery; enjoy there the quiet atmosphere (only slightly altered by the students evidently taking a break from school), so different from the bustling activities on the adjacent main street. Before entering Durbar Square just walk around the main Bazaar and the delightful small shops. Touts advertising a bit of everything are active in Thamel as in any other place of this kind, but I found them quite less annoying than in similar places of Delhi or Agra, for instance."

Enjoy the ride through Thamel at any pace, lose yourself peacefully through all narrow streets, see the temples, the open markets, the fresh fruit and vegetables as well as the antiques, shop for some mountaineering equipment if you need it or just spend good minutes in a bookshop to go through all sorts of titles, languages and topics. Tips: do not hurry to buy, the merchandise you find in the shops situated in \"the center\" of Thamel, even when offered with a good discount, may be found cheaper if you advance on to the corners.

Thamel is THE location to stay if you have never been to Kathmandu (rich tourists usually stay elsewhere, such as nearby Durbar Marg, but miss a lot). It replaced Freak Street many years ago as the backpackers' Kathmandu destination. Narrow busy streets crammed with backpackers, old buildings, guesthouses, trekking agencies, minimarts, restaurants for every taste, trekking gear shops, 'pashmina' clothing and jewelry shops, Tibetan trinkets and Nepali kukuris, etc. Over the past 25 years, I have continued to come back. However, traffic has increased three-fold in Kathmandu since 2000, and air pollution has become intolerable, so I usually leave after a couple of days for a trek or to Pokhara. Thamel has only one main vehicle entrance from Kantipath Rd, which is inconvenient and adds to the urban density; however, making Thamel more vehicle-accessible would probably destroy a lot of its old-world character and not solve the other problems.From Thamel, all of the main Kathmandu Valley tourist attactions are accessible - the three Durbar Squares (Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan), Pashupathinath, Boudhanath, Swayambhunath, Nagarkhot, and others."

Evolving slowly over the years, Thamel is iconic; both stuck in time and being slowly renovated - reminiscent of Khaosan Road in Bangkok, but without the ping-pong shows and fried-bug vendors found there. Now supposedly open 24 hours, this maze-like neighborhood features great food and souvenirs galore. See the restaurant reviews for the best eats, but my favorite is Fire & Ice, for good pizza and lasagna. I also suggest that you park outside (several public lots near Garden of Dreams) and walk in, as the gullies are narrow and full of potholes and few establishments offer any sort of parking, motorbike or otherwise. While a centre for trekking supplies, I recommend you go to the new Sherpa outlet for that, as the quality of goods there is triple A and no knock-offs sold.

There are many coffee shops and restaurants to choose from but be careful of what you choose as a high percentage of tourists end up with tummy bug issues."

In Thamel you'll be able to buy anything your heart desires : cashmere, yak wool, wood carvings, metal statues, instruments, singing bowls, prayer flags, lanterns, artworks... Literally every Nepali thing is sold here. Don't forget to haggle, or else you'll be paying double or triple what the item is worth. My rule of thumb is to start at half or 2/3 the initial price when bargaining. Don't be afraid to walk away, there are hundreds of stores that sell the same things... The vendors know this and will do anything to keep you from walking out of their shop if they sense you are serious about buying. Be prepared for lots of honking on the streets... Pedestrians, rickshaws, motorbikes, and cows all share the small winding roads in this part of the city to be vigilant about what's around you. When crossing the street, maintain a consistent pace and don't try to slow down if you see a vehicle... This will only get you hit. Motorists are used to weaving their way around pedestrians. Pollution is heavy in the air here and I recommend coming with or buying a mask upon your arrival. The only country with worse air quality in the world is Bangladesh... The pollution can make you very sick so be careful. You'll often get young men coming up to you asking if you want weed/cannabis. Although it may be cheap to buy, nothing is worth sitting inside a Nepali jail for, and the police will crack down on tourists they find smoking. This is a very active and overwhelming part of town and I found myself tiring of it after a few days. One day at the beginning of your trip and one at the end should suffice for this area."

We had dinner at evening in a restaurant then went to the rock bar.The night life is very very recommendable to everyone.looking forward to visit here again."

We have reapeatdly asked locals to consider making Thamel a pedestrian mall, like in Shimla, Bundi and other places in India. They just get stuck in the mindset thinking it will mean a loss of business.Thamel is exciting, but for some of the wrong reasons now. It is increasingly dangerous to walk the streets there with crazy motor cyclists weaving through pedestrians at great speeds. Install pedestrian gates like on lakeside in Pokhara and make it people friendly.Still has the best eateries in KTM.Hotels there are getting dated and run down.Shopping is good for trekkers, but other areas are opening up."

However, the Asan Market sells goods to locals and shop owners won't try to sell you a brand new flat screen TV.And that is indeed the appeal!!!

One of the best places in Nepal that I miss & I'm still hoping to go back!"

I've lived in Kathmandu for over 2 months now and I still come to Thamel to get food when I'm tired of Nepali or Indian spice flavors. It's a lot more expensive than local places, but worth it. This tourist area usually has safer food practices so you most likely won't get sick. It has a Chinese food street (on the south side, parallel to Kanti Pur) that has real Chinese food, not the weird Nepali-fied Chinese food. The Chinese restaurants aren't that expensive, around 200 - 500 rupees per plate. The best part about Thamel is that it's close to the other shopping areas. If you don't want to deal with haggling from such a high tourist price, walk south about 10 minutes to Indra Chowk and many of the same pashminas and yak wool items are sold there. If you want the finer cashmere items, they are not sold there though. Also, if you want to buy some real Nepali gold or silver jewelry, not the common looking silver jewelry that's sold at every other store in Thamel, walk to New Road. It looks very Nepali, both silver and gold jewelry, and not like ordinary silver pendants and earrings you can find anywhere else in the world. New Road has the gold hoops with handmade beads and molded design bangles. If you walk towards King's Road, there are some decent shops, although KTM in general is awful for shopping and not cheap like Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur. But they have coffee shops, restaurants, and stores that are nicer and cleaner than other places around town.Tip on walking through Durbar Square - if you look like a tourist, you will be constantly hassled by the security asking if you bought a ticket. If you're not taking photos and visiting the sites, let them know you're just walking through. Let them know you were walking from Indra Chowk to New Road, or vice versa. They sometimes say okay, and wave you through. But most of the time, they are total jerks and yell at you and say you have to buy a ticket. It's a very annoying thing in all tourist areas in the valley. To avoid the headache, you can cut down off Indra Chowk early to avoid going through Durbar Square, or go in the back alley behind the square."

On our first day we learned that restaurants and shops don't usually open before 10AM, others, even at a later time (not sure if it's just because it was winter season). If you have a sensitive stomach you have to be very careful of where you choose to eat. I had days in Kathmandu where I dealt with bad diarrhea; almost missed my EBC plan. Once the shops and restaurants are open, the place could easily get crowded and dusty (though it's really dusty no matter of the date and time). I suggest that those people who are sensitive to dust bring something to cover their noses while roaming around the area or whole Kathmandu.Shopping can be fun here.

That being said, the prices you are given are never completely out of the ballpark so aggressive bartering is not required not recommended - if the shopkeeper is unwilling to go lower and you think the price is too high, just smile, thank the shopkeeper and walk away.

I recommend Shisha - that was my favourite place! IF you want to shop, either go with a local or negotiate at least half the price - because like in any other Asian country there are prices for tourists - and very big prices. You might get stalked to buy stuff, but if you don't even open the conversation or don't look to close to the things they sell they would leave you alone. Everything closes really early, so make sure you know how to get home on foot, or catch a taxi around midnight. I recommend buying Mandala drawings, they are really beautiful and I think deserve the money."

This is a huge shopping area and not too hard to get lost in. A rickshaw driver dropped us off and followed us the entire time we were there. We did not ask him to stay with us and he did not speak English like others do; so we let him wait for us while we walked. Shopping was fun. Lots of interesting things to look at. The cashmere prices were not a bargain. They will bargain. There are many fine restaurants in the area to chose from. I do not think it was tourist season; which was drastically reduced after last years earthquake. Thamel was not reduced to rubble like some other parts of the city. When it gets dark, the shops close. I was glad our driver had stayed with us. I also made sure he had food and something to drink while he waited. I gathered he was one of hundreds of refugees who came to the city looking for work. Many of them live in tents if they are lucky to find one. After dark, the streets light up with colorful lights and fires to keep warm by. The streets are very uneven and full of crazy motorbike drivers. Then the electricity goes out making the walk even more challenging. We were never aware of any problems the dark could cause, but never wondered after the shops closed. I never look for trouble that far from home and not speaking the language. All in all, the best exotic market I have visited."

There are tons of souvenirs. I didn't buy a lot, but did get some really cute felted items for kids back home. I wished I would have bought some of the knitted slippers. Its a fun place to browse and shop, if you enjoy shopping. I found that I had to be very direct and walk away quickly from some street vendors. If they catch you looking or if you engage at all, they will follow you. Its a very hard time there now with the fuel crisis so I don't begrudge people from trying to get money. It felt safe and I did not, nor did the people I traveled with, have any problem with pickpockets - not to say you shouldn't be careful. The fruit and vegetable sellers on the street are so colorful and provide good food to the locals. All-in-all it is a good place to visit and spend some time.

Remember, you need to haggle quite aggressively before you purchase! Foreigner vs Nepali (local) prices are quite stark... There are a whole lot of shops that sell the same goods, so walk away if you're quoted an exorbitant amount. we bought a wind breaker from one of the stores and realized the jacket was not in the best condition. check your goods before you leave. if you want to purchase a ghurka knife as a souvenir, go to a 'speciality' shop, you can get a pretty neat one for a good price. the ones that are sold along the roadside are usually of poor quality.taxis tend to over-quote by 40% - 50%, you can definitely bargain for a cheaper ride."

Firstly the choke of fumes, dust and pollution causes this cough which just develops into an almighty chest dry cough, so recommend a buff or scarf.There are barely any footpaths and whiilst this may make it look more ancient or mystical, it just makes it a never ending dash to not be hit by a car or bike. Like most poor countries there are beggars, young children used as bait, and men trying to befriend you or taxi or touts trying to get money. If you are looking for trekking gear there is no shortage here. The restaurants are few, ended up at Yak Restaurant because it had the most westerners the others I avoided for fear of poisoning.Honestly I don't get why people find this place mystical or religious or devine, having travelled to many Asian countries, I find this place so far removed from spiritualism or mystic, yet rather a polluted, poverty stricken country hanging on by a thread as India or China knock on their door.

A travel agency on the Nepal side of the border arranged everything for me after crossing from India).And as for the convenience of getting to major \"must see\" tourist sights from this area: the main Durbar Square (also called the Basantapur Durbar Square after the Basantapur Tower at Hanuman Dhoka Palace located on the square) is only about a ten-minute walk south from the Chhetrapati Chowk at the center of the area (as mentioned above); Garden of Dreams is just like a five-minute walk east from the eastern edge of the area (which itself is about ten minutes from Chhetrapati Chowk); and Swayambhunath Stupa hill is about a half-hour walk west from the area."

All in all Thamel is recovering, at least on the outside, it now needs people to visit and help the economy to recover."

I didn't find the vendors pushy or creepy...they were the exact opposite. If you're trying to find a specific restaurant I suggest asking for directions or taking a rickshaw. People are very friendly and if they can help you they will. The street decorations, signs, smells, lights, music, horns, and bells were rather delightful. Indulge."

It had the feel of a crowded, low-cost neighborhood providing services to budget travelers. Most shops and even hotels are comparatively small but clean, and the narrow streets are rough with potholes, obviously not designed for such heavy taxi-rickshaw-truck-motorcycle traffic. We had to bring back small and inexpensive souvenirs for about 20 people, and the task was easy. Nepalese have created shops or restaurants that are suited to Western languages, likes or needs, yet they remain entirely Nepalese. Some shops are giving way to more formal, modern multi-storied arcades with higher prices reflecting the higher rent. Prices for items such as T-shirts are actually higher than in areas just outside of Thamel. The shopping and tourist area has spread out of Thamel into adjacent areas, particularly to the south. It is easy to walk from Thamel to the Durbar Square area. The availability of many shops selling similar items makes it easy for comparative shopping. We usually discovered the lowest price for items only when we held firm on our price and walked away without the merchant calling us back. We feel there is something for almost every tourist in Thamel. We felt sad when we realized that we had explored every one of the twisting and winding streets in Thamel and there were no more new shops to be found."

Sprawled over a large area, it is distinguished by its narrow alleyways, overflowing with assorted goods and busy hawkers. Various shops, businesses and eateries line the streets. Pilgrims and visitors also crowd its lanes. In modern times, it has turned into a hotspot centre for tourism, especially as a base for trekkers and mountaineers.PROS: It is in the middle of the city so quite accessible to pedestrians, although it can be challenging to negotiate with cars, trucks, motorcycles or rickshaws. It is also quite extensive so one day is not enough to explore this place. It is comparable to a Middle Eastern souk or an Asian marketplace. Whatever you call it, it cannot be called boring. Everything is here.CONS: For all its extensive sprawl, it would take you some time to orient yourself. I got lost my first few days. What helped me was to memorize the different kinds of streamers strung across each alleyway (silver, white, red, no streamers and so forth) along the way to and from my hotel to Durbar Square. Sometimes, the dusty roads turn muddy after a rainfall.Verdict: Worth a visit. To some, it is a ghetto; to others, a fascinating place. In some sense, if you want to go anywhere in Kathmandu, you really can't avoid Thamel. Let its whirlwind of sounds, aroma and colour beckon to you. Your choice. Grade A-minus.."

The places is packed with restaurants of all types and budgets, there are trekking shops, gift shops and the best range of book shops in Asia. If you haven't planned your trek, then this is the place to find an agency (shop around, ask questions). It's all in this amazing place. Make friends, meet locals, have a beer, get lost in the maze of streets. My advise is to take your time with the place, get to know it. Find a local bar/cafe (New Orleans Cafe is my favorite) and become a regular. the fun thing is that when your done with your trek, and you come back to Thamel, you'll bump into just about every other trekker you met on your trek, because everyone ends up back here in the end!"

There are numerous shops selling, books, maps, clothes, food, trekking gear, fashion gear, fruit and vegetables, pots and pans, and restaurants and cafe's offering French, Spanish, Nepali, Indian, Italian and many other dishes."

If you purchase it from your travel agent in your home country, you will be paying 20 to 50% more than if you come here and book it. Some have websites so you can book from home. Every other storefront is a tour company. When you book your tours, make sure that everything which is and is not included is explicitly written in your contract and itinerary. Some include all meals, some include meals but not drinks, some include breakfast, some include all meals and water but not other drinks, some don't include water. You will go through a lot of water. All prices in Nepal are 20% to 200% more for tourists, so there is always plenty of room to bargain. Also, look up the hotels or tea houses you will be staying in while on your treks.

Most people are friendly enough and much of the stuff you buy is made right there in Katmandu. It's also very inexpensive. With an exchange rate of 100 rupees for $1.00 USD, it's hard not to find a bargain. Watch the traffic. It's completely annoying with taxis and scooters whizzing about in small roadways.

I am glad I came because Kathmandu is in good condition to visit and sightseeing, some temples in Durbar Square may have collapsed or cracked but still worth visiting. My family and I are having good time here. My opinion is, you can visit Nepal, the guesthouse owners or the traveling agents are friendly people to help you by all means, after all, one local people once told me, Nepal stands for \"Never Ending Peace And Love\". If you want to help Nepal to rebuild after earthquake, come and visit Nepal, seeing is believing, your visitation is the best support to help Nepal recovering from earthquakes.Lastly, a big thanks to Visit Heaven Treks Pvt.

The sensory overload on your first day cannot be described.First, the drivers are crazy--especially the taxis. There are no traffic controls, i.e., no lights, no stop signs, no yield signs, nada--it's a free for all. But it is exciting.We stayed here for a few days before our Mt. Everest Base Camp Trek, first, in a hostel, and upon our return after our trek, in a more Westernized hotel. The reason for the change is the earthquake struck while we were on our trek. Our hostel was damaged beyond the point you could stay there, so we had to move.The people in Kathmandu, and Nepal in general, are kind, humble, and amongst the most wonderful people I've encountered in my travels. There are shops galore--and you better figure out how to negotiate prior to shopping--with excellent quality trekking knock-offs in a lot of shops. Very little is authentic here, but the quality is still good.I found the shopkeepers pleasant and on non-apparel items, excellent priced.There are so many restaurants you could eat in a different place every day for over a month I would think. But what was really a surprise is all signs were in English. This was remarkable, considering I had a hard time in South American countries since I don't speak Spanish and very little was in English. To travel to Nepal and have absolutely zero problems understanding both the signs and the people was remarkable.The Thamel section of Kathmandu is an Oasis of Commerce and I think there's problem nothing you cannot find there, if you're not concerned with authenticity. Eat out in any of the restaurants and enjoy their culture and their cuisine.I am looking forward to the day I can return."

June is low season because of the monsoon which usually starts around the middle of the month so I expected ot not be too busy. However, the earthquake reduced the number of travellers to Nepal dramatically.Most of the shops, restaurants, bars and souvenir shops were open and those that were closed were probably due to to a lack of business rather than the direct impact of the quake. There was some damage to buildings in the area with rubble on the streets i a few places. Overall though it was still possible to visit and enjoy Thamel and I think it will be almost back to normal in the autumn but with fewer visitors than in previous years because of the quake."

If you are visiting Kathmandu you will obviously be here, here you will find people from almost all nationalities in the world and food from almost all nationalities (at least the nations famous for food like Italian, French, Japanese, Thai etc hope you get the drift). You will find gazillions of bars and massage places in Thamel so good luck getting drunk and pampered. You will also find gazillions of travel agents so travelling throughout Nepal or outside Nepal will not be so much of a problem if you stay in Thamel. The rates are a bit stiff, you are tourist after all, but you can obviously bargain and also find cheap stays in this place. You can find artifacts and souvenirs which you can take back and the biggest of all you will find Khukuri's for sale :). Enjoy your stay."

Apart from that, you will find shops with curios, bars, dancebars, restaurants offering superb chinese food and even hotels. The vibrancy of this place is awesome. The goodness of the Nepali people is evident when you are here. Even being a very big attraction for tourists, the vendors and shops will definitely not try to cheat you. Yes, most items are overpriced but no cheating. Feel free to walk the bylanes of Thamel and enjoy an entire evening drinking, watching beautiful girls dance to hindi music in the dancebars and have a hearty meal."

For trekking, I managed to get all the gear I needed.

Dozens of good restaurants and bars and a great nightlife. Souvenirs possibly cheaper in Bhaktrapur. Stores sell a wide range of foods, toiletries, cosmetics, medical items,but you may have to try a few to find something specific.

I slept in my hotel (no damage) and lovingly wandered the entire Thamel for 3 weeks after both hits and found, delightfully so, that my favorite hang out cafes and restaurants were either fully intact or had minor damage. All had reopened a few days after the quake. Thamel abounds with any cuisine of your fancy, fabulous bakeries, great coffee houses, shopping --- it is the Mecca for cashmere and it is the perfect Mecca for pre or post-trekking. The Thamel is a traveler's Old World Dream complete with narrow, winding streets, loud noises, horns beeping, soft music coming from shop interiors, rickshaws and street food vendors. The shopping is nothing short of fabulous. Northface and Columbia sporting articles, clothing and gear, can be purchased. They will be knock-offs but I purchased items and found them to be of good quality. The REAL Northface store is on Tridevi Marg.The world will return to the Thamel because we will not stay away from the lovely Nepalese people, their culture, the Himalayas, and Mt Everest.This includes me.Happy planning for a STILL most serious destination !"

If you want to buy trekking equipment and clothes-this is a good place to do so. Its restaurants and cafes cover the whole spectrum from bad to good. I encourage people to try some of the small, Gurkha, restaurants with only a couple of tables as well as the more 'conventional' restaurants. The touting isn't as 'full on' as some other Asian countries, however, if you ask for a price of a souvenir from a street vendor, expect to be followed for some time with various offers being made - none in an aggressive manner. I found the vendors well-mannered. ATMs are found in many places although some have caps on the amount you can take out (often R10,000). Try looking past Thamel-in particular in the old town/bazaar area south of Thamel and across the river to the north. Here, you won't find many tourists."

There are a few original trekking shops, between Thamel and the Garden of Dreams, like North Face. The knock off shops within Thamel have a big range of equipment and clothing at very good prices, we used a few items for our EBC climb and had no problems. The tourist shops sell the usual items, we found most of the items very comparably to buying in Patan or Bouda. Just a note, not one of the hotels we stayed in was immune to the noise pollution that is prevalent in this suburb. Thamal is also within walking distance to the Durbar Square via the Asan market, which I would highly recommend if you would like to browse through street filled with every day Nepali items.

If they made it pedestrian-only or even permit-only (rumored) it would be a 3 but right now it's not a very nice place to be! At least the \"sell\" is softer than India, Morocco, etc."

Turn a corner into a small alley (of which there are lots and lots) and discover something new all day long. We had a guide for the first half day we arrived to help us get a feel of the place and some historical background and that was great. It's a place full of restaurants, hotels, travel/trekking agencies, but I wouldnt stay anywhere else. You could stay somewhere peaceful outside of town, but unless this just isnt your cup of tea, trying to commute into Thamel would be a nightmare in itself. Traffic can be very slow and air quality is often bad. Stay here to see Thamel, then go somewhere else for the peace and quiet. There is so much within walking distance and there are so many daytrips you can make out of town that make this such a great town to spend a few days in. As you can tell, we loved Kathmandu."

Its aso great to sit on a rooftop terrace like Bon Appetit and watch the world below . Always something to see"

Thamel is the tourist hub of Kathmandu and as such its not really much of a place to dip into the real city, though it does have a fascination of its own. Most of the main hotels and hostels are based here and there are shops servicing the needs of both the hardy trekkers and the casual traveller. There's plenty of interesting souvenir material though haggling can be a waste of effort as most of the shops seem to operate an unspoken cartel, though when you come to think of prices are pretty inexpensive on the whole. A great selection of restaurants covering a range of tastes and cuisines, best to read the individual reviews on here or play for pot luck. Oh and you'll probably find yourself offered certain illegal substances, an offer I didn't take up and wouldn't encourage but if you choose to do so I'd say \"caveat emptor\"!"

After seeing more of Kathmandu, on my next trip I think I would stay elsewhere. Perhaps around Patan where it is cleaner and the buildings are more interesting. My hotel in Thamel, Thorong Peak Guesthouse, was very nice but there was a noisy dance club near it at night. Very difficult to navigate around Thamel and the rest of the city as the roads wind like mad and there are almost no street signs. Be prepared for really bad air too, as some days the smog is very heavy. Overall, it was a fun and exotic experience. Be wary of the massage places. Stay away, far away, from Fishtail Spa in Thamel."

The best in woollen that you should buy is pashmina which is made from mountain goat beard hair. This is one product that you can easily get duped as there are a million varieties.

Didn't feel pressured into buying stuff in the shops at all - the only slight annoyance was the occasional charachter asking if we wanted hassish.... which we took as a compliment that at 50 we can stil look part of the \"in\" crowd !

But maybe not for the serious trekker. It is very very cheap if you are prepared to haggle. There are also some fantastic souvenirs, clothing and handcrafts at bargain prices. Beware! You can pay 4 to 5 times the price if you don't check prices with a range of shops. I recommend taking your time and not being over interested.

I went with 2 other friends just before college for a 7-day hike around Kathmandu Pokhara. The scenery, i can never do it justice with words, but I could try! The mountains we could see in the distance were snowcapped, and we could see them from almost all our rest stops. For example, we would wake up to the sunrise, and it would be quite cloudy sometimes, but there would be at least 10 minutes where the clouds would just clear, and from our beds we would stare breathless at the mountains. It was simply surreal. Throughout the treks we also got to experience incredible views of the landscape. Of course the higher you went, the more rewarding it was, but no matter where we were, we got to see the day-to-day lives of the nepalese people in the region, and it was a real eye-opener. You would always see the kids being happy with what they had, and there was so much to be admired of the people. Oh and the food up there, they honestly had a shockingly wide variety which always tasted good. And the Milk Tea after a long hike, is just perfect :) In the city itself, we had a couple of days to look around. The food was good, everything was cheap, we were brought around by Mr. Bodhraj Koirala (he's in Glance Himalayas) who showed us a great time and even hosted us for dinner on the last night. The internal flights might be scary for some, but it was exciting for us, although navigating in the airport wasn't the easiest task.It was a fantastic trip, and well worth the money. Most, if not all, of the credit (as all my my friends agreed), was thanks to Mr. Bodhraj Koirala, and our guide Hridaya! (Hridaya was awesome, I've lost contact with him, but do request for him for a wonderful trip!) Definitely recommend anyone to go!"

Note : \"There is no other place which actually comes close to Thamel in entire Kathmandu\" 2. Its equivalent - just to give you a feel : Khao san road in Bangkok, MG road in Bangalore, Bagha Beach in Goa..3. The area basically consists of three main parallel roads - a) Thamel Marg b)Chaksibari Marg c) Amrit marg - check google map for an idea. 4. You will be spoilt for choises while choosing between the following in Thamel a) Resturants b)Hotels c)shops to buy trekking gear, winter wear d)trinkets to carry back home e)supermarkets - mainly supplying the daily food requirements5. Thamel is a place to stay, from here you can go to the several of the destinations / site seeing places in Kathmandu. the first one is Kathmandu Darbar Square ( 1.5kms)"

If you start to walk out they will usually agree to your price, but say something cutesy, \"I would prefer more, but you did not want to pay it\""

However, you'd be missing out because, despite the motor-bikes, the noise and the general shabbiness of the place, it is also wonderfully vibrant and friendly.Of course the shop-keepers, rickshaw drivers, street-sellers and taxis are all desperate to part you from your money, but they do it in a way that is hard to take offence at. You can buy anything and everything here although, it must be said that the actual range of goods, when you analyse it, is actually quite small: hand-embroidered t-shirts, other clothes, brass, stone and pottery, fabrics, carpets, trekking gear, jewellery, tea and coffee. Of course, this may sound like a lot but when you find that each shop sells the same things it does become a bit dull. However, if you can stand the constant badgering and you're feeling fit and well (and you are wearing an anti-pollution mask which is, sadly a necessity now) it's fun for a while. Exhausting, but fun."

It is easy to get your money out safely from several ATMs; hunt for souvenirs; and send them home via air cargo. Thamel is also conveniently located, allowing easy access - even on foot - to important historical, cultural and religious highlights that Kathmandu has to offer such as Kathmandu Durbar Square where the Royal Kumari, the Living Goddess, resides; Monkey Temple aka Swoyambhunath; Garden of Dreams; Royal Palace Museum, etc. All these places are walks of 10 to 30 minutes from us.

If you are new to Nepal, or just want to experience an electric atmosphere with extremely friendly Nepali locals and mouth watering food, as well as gain help with organising adventures around Nepal, then Thamel is the place for you. The conversations are endless, the haggling is infectious, the atmosphere is (as previously mentioned) electric, the food and local tea is delicious, and I could walk down the street at night and feel completely safe. Thamel offers everything. It is a place for families looking to transition into the Nepali life and purchase beautiful handcrafted gifts, for solo people looking to meet locals and other travellers, for adventurous backpackers looking to organise their new challenge, and for part goers looking to find the best bars and clubs. The day life, the night life, you wont forget the Thamel life."

The people are warm and friendly and chatting to the various shop keepers is just as much fun as the shopping.

It's the best place to buy Pashmina,Yak wool and cashmere items such as shawls, sweaters, caps and winter wear. Lokta paper and paper products, such as stationery, lampshades, wrapping paper, carry bags and lovely Christmas cards are popular items. Tea comes wrapped in a small pouch and makes a lovely gift. Thamel has a great variety of Thanka paintings which are executed in cotton, canvas or silk using gold, silver and stone pigment. In other words, it's a great place to get your souvenir shopping done. A great variety of restaurants here also with lots of them recommended by 'Lonely Planet'. The place has a great buzz!"

Hundreds of people crowding around the stage to usher in the festivities. But aside from that, this place is never short of crowds and traffic. As you walk the narrow streets, be prepared to be honked at at least once!Shopping paradise for those keen on outdoor gears, arts & crafts, beads and embroidery. Almost all outdoor gears are knock offs but quality not too bad for short term usage. If you like to eat Naan, give a restaurant called \"Curry Kitchen\" a go. We loved their Naan, just nice and soft. It's located above the Hot Breads bakery. Quite easy to find, you shouldn't miss it."

It makes you want to explore the colorful walls of merchandise. The vendors I came across were very unobtrusive. This made browsing alot more pleasant. Most vendors do not take credit cards or other foreign money. ATMS and money exchanger booths can be found to obtain money in Nepalese Rupees. There are some more structured stores that accept credit cards, for example, The North Face store selling genuine North Face products.Thamel offers many things throughout the city. I took a stroll along a busy street that led me to more local market where there are less tourists. I loved it. I saw sacks of different wheat, rice, and potatoes. An array of dried fish in satchels. Spicy chili peppers of all sorts. Teas galore and not to mention all sorts of fresh meats out on the counters. I enjoyed seeing some of the real shopping the locals do. It is a moving place and you have to pay mind to the cars and bikes on the streets. So overall, one can find mountaineering clothing/equipment, SIM cards, gloves, hats, food, soft drinks, water, arts, jewelry, yak wool gifts. batteries, bottled water, etc!"

I'm sad to say that in the intervening 22 years Thamel has been destroyed. It used to be low-rise (nothing bigger than two or three floors) with lots of green spaces and the only traffic was cycle rickshaws. Now there are buildings at least 7 floors tall, blotting out the sun like in New York, the streets are thronged with jeeps and motorbikes and you can barely walk ten metres without someone trying to sell you hashish. The dirt, noise and pollution is ridiculous. Buy a facemask or suffer the respiratory consequences. Thamel is just one giant hippie shopping mall, full of shops selling rainbow hats, brass buddhas and OM fridge magnets and a massive array of restaurants, which will surely be appreciated after the limited fare on offer whilst trekking. I am very sad that it has been so spoiled in 22 years, and I worry that when the next major earthquake happens there are going to be so many fatalities because of the terrible ways that buildings have been added onto. Some of the buildings look like you could push them over. I guess Thamel is a victim of its own success, sadly!"

Located at the centre of the heart, Thamel has something for everyone - Be you with your family or with friends, or even alone - Thamel has the ability to keep you engaged and interested in it. There are small shops selling everything under the sun - from very ordinary to unique. In between the jungle of shops, hidden are cosy and quaint cafes and bars, serving anything you desire for - coffee, beer or even milk!Some of the restaurants offer a variety of food - from Nepalese to Korean to Thai and Chinese - to suit your palate. In between narrow lanes - which are perfect for leisurely walks, there are miniature Stupas and strange temples which invariably attract the passers by. As the evening approaches, and it becomes a bit chilly, the nightlife of Thamel wakes up to keep you warm. Taxis (noiseless Maruti 800) start crawling on the streets, fairy lights adorn the streets, and music from dance bars starts filling every corner. Thamel is interesting if you are willing to have a leisure holiday and not in a hurry to achieve a lot in a short time."

You start and end in Thamel. As soon as you leave it you realize this area is deliberately left in an antique state for the expats to immediately enjoy on arrival. When you get a half mile away you see their grasp on the 21st. Century. A very tenuous grasp it may be but Thamel is not a true reflection of greater Kathmandu. Who cares? When you leave Kathmandu you wil see much more rustic environs. I say stay in Thamel and kick up a fuss! Gear up for that Annapurna trek or whatever you came for. This is truly a one of a kind place!

Friendly people, a natural wonder and gateway to the Himalayas and was expecting to find small buildings, and lots of greenery, parks and open spaces. My first glimpse was from the plane. It is huge, it is high rise and it is most definitely a city. But Thamel is friendly, fun and full of culture. It is absolutely worth a visit and it is truly a heart-warming place. Today I sat for an hour watching men, small Nepalese men, cart baskets of heavy wet concrete up 5 storeys of stairs to flick the basket and empty the contents into a pile so the next level of a new hotel could be built. It was back breaking work and they did it with a smile, laughter and a lot of hard work. They are traditionalists and at sundown we watched as many people filed passed a bell to ring to signalling the end of the day. The day had been sunny and I watched as all the women climbed to their roof top terraces to hang their washing on a glorious day, they also took the opportunity to wash their hair and to see mothers, daughters and grand-mothers all sitting and brushing each other's hair and enjoying the sun and the great natural hairdryer was such a calming and simply enjoyable experience. We take a lot for granted in life, and Thamel makes you realise that these people are happy, truly happy and have not much more than the clothes on their backs. A life lesson learned in Thamel."

O ne can possibly bargain, but they may quote very high and bring it down a little. It is difficult to find a shop with marked or fixed prices for Tangkas or other items. One has to be careful of vehicles and motorbikes which do not care for pedestrians in narrow streets.. There are food stalls and restaurants of varying quality and cleanliness.Still it is a place worth a visit, but better to go in company and keep track of where you go."

Once upon a time - when the hippies all congregated near Durbar Square and hung out on Freak Street - Thamel was a sleepy residential backwater with a couple of hotels and some pioneer restaurants (including KC's - still there after many decades). Gradually over the years it became a centre for foreign tourists, with numerous places to stay from the cheapest lodges to the most expensive luxury hotels, restaurants ditto and shops selling all kinds of stuff from trekking equipment to curios and handmade art and artefacts and clothing. Now it buzzes with activity, offering tourists and others an amazing range of restaurants offering ethnic food from all over the world as well as some basic Nepal restaurants with dhal-bhat; and coffee houses and dance-bars and nightclubs for the wealthier youth of Kathmandu who flock in for an evening of mild naughtiness. In fact its getting overcrowded and the older buildings are being replaced with more modern structures - eventually it risks losing its appeal and becoming something garish and over-priced... I still keep coming back.. but for how much longer?"

That jacket you loved back home that cost $400 and is just $26 dollars here in Thamel is that price for a reason. Check the tags and make sure the materials match expectations. Second, I suggest staying off the big streets and shopping in the smaller allies. The probability of getting something cheaper is higher there. That and bargaining power. One must haggle and haggle a lot. I haggle more I nepal than I even do in India because all the shops carry mostly the same stuff... So if you don't like the price at the first place, simply move on to the next store. If you find it was cheaper at a previous store after all, 97% of the time they will still honor it."

During night stay away from people who offer you services like massage, sex etc. They will tell you that girls would be available after midnight. By the time you wait for midnight you won't even notice that some girls sitting nearby you are drinking and having fun and you have to pay the bill. A juice could start from 700 to 1000. which means you will end up by hotel goons to pay. And last there will be no girl which you are fantasizing about.Its good place to eat, but keyword is Bargain."

Getting lost in Thamel is a must do in Nepal, definitely!!Some recommendations based on my experience, and all of these are on the same street with Kathmandu Guest House, the oldest guesthouse in Kathmandu:1. Spa: Tranquility Spa, try the Ayurvedic Massage. Trekkers massage just seems like something that is overpriced to fit the purpose.2. Book Shop: Pilgrims (near Tranquility Spa)3. Food: Northfield & Jesse James for dinner, they have local bands playing instrumental piece. Serves variety of food, mainly good for Mexican food. Opens for bfast till dinner.4. Yoga and stay: Hotel Himalaya Yoga. You pay for the room and get free yoga on the rooftop. Good deal! Walk in has to pay 500rps for yoga. Which is not bad either. Teacher is good.All in all, don't get tired of the place, stop for coffee or lassi whenever you can and enjoy the madness!"

We learned this the hard way, by not walking away. You can always get the real price if you haggle for a bit, and then leave. When you are leaving, the vendor will always tell you a legitimate price in order to try to get your business. That way, when you approach a second vendor, you know what the item should cost and you can start your haggling at that price. We also learned, over masala tea with a local Nepali pashmina vendor, that all of the colored pashminas that say 100% cashmere are not necessarily 100% cashmere. You also have to be careful when buying scarves because many of them are imported from India or China, so if you want to support the local economy, try to buy from a vendor selling actual Nepali goat wool scarves. Ask to see a \"ring scarf\"...engage in conversation with a local vendor about the story of this special, high quality scarf. You will be amazed at the skill that it takes to make one of these scarves, and their versatility with respect to travel!"

Nepal is known for their rugs, although most of the rugs we saw and in fact bought were made by Tibetan women. You can also find really good scarves made of Kashmir silk. I also discovered that they have very good fabric from India. If you are I to quilting, there are small shops around Thamel which would be a paradise for quilters. The downside walking around the place was that the streets were very narrow and there are no sidewalk, so you need to be careful with speeding cars and motor bikes."

There are some ok clothes, but they are not worn by locals, they are purely a fabrication of the tourist industry and the perception that Nepal is a laid back, groovy destination. It's important because a lot of Nepalese are benefiting financially from the tourism in the country. BUT: the streets are filthy, not unlike the surrounding non-tourist areas of this sprawling disorderly city; a lot of the interactions with local business people feel fake and tourist prices and straight up price hiking/cheating it prevalent. Taxis, rickshaws and street drug dealers will hassle you without fail + the insincere \"namaste\" from shop owners and \"hello\" from beggars can sometimes keep your attention on defensive behavior. Nonetheless, I think the tempo of these negative aspects stay calm enough to not become upsetting on a 2-3 day stay."

Egotistical corrupt fraudsters steeling all the benefits from grass roots Nepalis living on the poverty line. And mostly, we all turn a blind eye. But corrupt ineffective government has left Thamel drinking directly from the rancid sewer. Almost all the historic water wells that supply Thamel have been contaminated by sewerage. Thamel us sitting on an underground lake of sewage. From there it is pumped into hotel roof top tanks, buckets of bleach are thrown in to kill the give away stench of human waste and then the resultant brew flows down to kitchens , laundries and bathrooms. Stay in Thamel and you are bathing in sewage. So all those dirty bathroom reviews, are in fact missing the point. The bathrooms are sewage stained. Simple as that. Ever seen the waxy hair syndrome amongst Thamel travellers? Yep, it is the bleached sewage final rinse. Arsenic levels are more than 10 times the W.H.O. upper limit. Its utterly toxic. Personally I think its time for a massive Thamel boycott to ram home that while politicians steel national resources and avoid their duty, Nepal will be punished hard by enlightened travelers. Give Thamel a big miss because all that glitters is not gold. Stay at Boubhanath, but not in the inner circle because that has the same problem. Always ensure you have town water not supplemented by pumping from wells. Honestly, its a bloody disaster -:and its time. travellers knew the truth about a big dark secret the Government is ignoring."

For foreigners, you need to very careful with the place where you eat as hygiene in these joints is not good.For shopping, our wives bought a few dresses and shawls/ stoles. You have to bargain really hard on the prices, as the prices they quote will be really high, especially to foreigners, who pay in dollars. Some of the shopkeepers themselves told us that they quote a price 5 times higher to foreigners compared to Indians and also close the deal at 2-3 times higher prices.There is some good mountaineering stuff also available here, especially at the North Face store near Sanjay Ghose chowk, but it is quite expensive.Overall a good place to shop around and enjoy the market.

It really felt central to both bus stations/airport and great dining/sights and had a plethora of little shops for souvenirs/gifts and items for trekking. We picked up hiking poles and clothing and were glad for the abundance/availability in Thamel. Further, our tour operator was based in Thamel which was super in terms of being able to visit the office, make arrangements and etc. In terms of souvenirs/shops I appreciated the variety of shops with a social conscience where they clearly supported communities either through fair trade or by giving back percentages of funds raised. When it came to the clothing shops, we shopped for both trekking and casual wear and were very pleased with what we found. Some have said \"come with nothing but the clothes you stand up in, and go from there\" (in terms of very affordable clothes, and the variety to choose from). I don't know if I'd go that far, but I would say if you're \"on the fence\" which what to wear/bring: bring a handful of basics and welcome the opportunity to pick-up missing pieces once there. Truly they have everything from fleece jackets, hiking boots and tents to swim suits, dresses and casual wear. In terms of snacks/toiletries there are many little corner shops that will perhaps not have brands you're familiar with, but that do the job (very affordably) AND possibly the best investment was a two-prong adapter which cost about 1$ Canadian (there) but I could only locate in specialty shops prior to leaving for 20$ dollars in Canada (and it worked perfectly with converter/adapters that I brought).Hope this helps! Safe and happy travels!"

It might bea paradise for non-Asians as it quite resembled=\"Paharganj (New Delhi). But for us it was a ordinary place. We decided to eat something but could not get anything worth. We tried some snacks but they were of sub-standard quality. Roaming Thamel gave me a uncanning feeling and we left it as soon as we could."

There are so many shops and you can really get good deals if you aren't afraid to haggle. Street vendors can be very persistent, so unless you really want to get something they are selling, say no thank you and look away - otherwise you will be followed doggedly through the alleyways. Besides shopping, there is a fantastic - as in your Italian grandma's cooking from New York fantastic - Italian restaurant in Thamel across from a grocery store. It is upstairs and is called \"Dolce Vida\". Amazing food! There is also an incredible farmers market within a block of the Thamel shopping district which is the hangout for those old Woodstock hippies that disappeared. Fun place for delicious baked goods, amazing espresso and delectable French cheeses and meats."

You should also consider staying in another part of Kathmandu.However, after staying in another part of Kathmandu (where I was one of the 3 tourists in the only guest house), I was ready to go stay in Thamel. The shopping was great, the bars/restaurants were plentiful, the nightlife was awesome, and it was easy to coordinate other trips from Thamel.It's worth walking through for anybody, but consider what you're looking for when you decide where to stay. You'll have fun, but it won't be a very authentic experience. Also, remember to bargain at the shops. A lot of the prices were at least double of what they should have been. I don't mind paying an extra 100 rps for something, but I do mind paying 2000 rps when the item should be 300-400.Ask at lots of shops before you buy... and, shopping on a rainy day is good.Don't be as aggressive about bargaining as you may be in India, though. Ask around for prices first, and tell them how much you got other things for."

It becomes essential for a prolonged stay here to invest in a surgical face mask that the Japanese have made famous in their own country. But believe me, Japanese cities are nowhere near as dangerously polluted as here in Thamel.If you can withstand the pollution, you can marvel at the shops and restaurants on display, and these shops in Thamel sell everything from Tibetan bowls, to Gurkha swords, to hooka, to charming little amulets.Another thing you must be wary of in Thamel is the narrow streets. The narrowness is what gives the area its charm, admittedly, although you must heed the honking of the horns, as taxi drivers and guys on mopeds are not known as the most careful or patient drivers in the world.I stayed at a hotel in the middle of Thamel called Gaju Suite, and from there I could easily walk eastwards to the Garden of Dreams, which is a nice respite from the smog at the far end of Thamel."

It is inevitable that at some stage, if you walk deep enough in Thamel, you will get lost but then you will see things and perhaps have conversations that you won't if you stay in 'upper' Thamel.

I like wandering from Thamel through to New Road where the locals tend to shop. Also the prices are more realistic there. Thamel prices tend to be very much inflated for tourists. Also Lazimpat Road has some really good Handicraft shops on both sides heading from Thamel towards the Shangri-la hotel."

This is the place to come for new or second hand trekking gear and maps as well as guides and porters if you need them (though cheaper and more reliable to do this in advance). Most trekking companies have outlets in Thamel. You can also do your money exchange and banking here. I recommend going into the supermarket here to pick up very cheap soaps, shampoos, food items, snacks for your pack and a face mask if you want one (good idea on dusty trails and around town).

The prices are reasonable by western standards, but there IS a reason that locals do NOT shop here; you can find much better prices if you're willing to venture past the tourist zone.Most tourists stay just a few days, but if you are here for a longer duration (I spent 3 weeks) you will find that many of the merchants will recognize you, the regular flute hawkers will no longer bother you, and you will become friends with some of the workers in your regular hangouts."

I mean, Thamel was alright, it had a lot of tourists and the second busiest nightlife we came across in Nepal (first being Pokhara), but it's just so hectic and we didn't get the best vibes from the people there. Store owners would charge 1100Rs for a pair of pants identical to ones that cost 200Rs everywhere else, and I caught one man peeking at me while I was in his change room trying clothes on. We planned to spend four or five nights here but returned to Bodnath after two because we were just not happy. Instead of Thamel, stay at the Happiness Guesthouse in Bodnath and take the 400Rs taxis into town."

The shopkeepers seem to think westerners have bags of endless money and so they try to get the highest price...opportunists or rip offs??? U decide. I was suprised to find prices as high as they were. Even accepting there is a double standard for local vs foreigners, I think much of it is inflated.If you stand in one place too long you will be approached by taxi drivers, rickshaw drivers, trinket gypsies, tatoo artists, dope peddlers and tour guides all trying to drum up business.

Thamel has beautiful Nepali treasures and trekking gear. You can also buy many other necessities (toiletries, feminine products, etc.) that you won't find off the beaten path, or off the tourist circuit.

But they are also full of lovely little nooks and crannies and full of bright and wonderful goods, lots are hand made here in Khatmandu. Yes the prices are higher than other areas of Khatmandu but it is no different to any city centre any where in the world. I have no doubt the price of shops and stalls is higher too because of the location. So yes you can bargain and maybe knock a few rupees of an item but then that cuts into the tiny profits there is to be made."

Now, Thamel has been a tourist destination in Kathmandu since the hippie movement and you can actually feel the hippie pulse once in Thamel! Even though Thamel has been referred to as the \"ghetto\" by some, most low-budget travelers consider it a tourist heaven. Thamel is distinguished by its narrow streets crowded with various shops and vendors. Commonly sold goods include food, pastries, walking gear, music, DVDs, handicrafts, and clothes. Travel agencies, and budget hotels, restaurants also line the streets. Of the many hotels the most famous are Kathmandu Guest house, Hotel Norbulinka are famous. There are many bakeries in Thamel and one must try them if in Thamel. Some bakeries are, The Bakery Cafe, The Pumpernickel Bakery, The Weizenl Bakery and many more. Thamel has a great night life and once the sun sets Thamel wakes up. The Irish Pub was one of my favourite hot spots. Other pubs around Thamel are the Northfield Cafe, Paddy Foleys Pub, Road House Cafe etc. There are a few steak houses in Thamel and all of them serve good steaks. My personal favourite is a rare done Chateaubriand steak at the Everest Steak House. Thamel also acts as the pre-base camp for mountaineers. It boasts a wide range of mountaineering gear shops, foreign money exchange booths, pubs, clubs, and nightlife along with the numerous travel agents and guest houses. All in all, Thamel is home to a wide range of audience of the Nepalese population for entertainment and employment purposes. On Wednesday, 28 September 2011, Thamel was declared a full Wi-fi zone in Nepal.A word of caution here - The gift shops in Thamel are very much over priced and it is always better to avoid them. Also do not buy CD's / DVD's / Blu-Ray's from Thamel as they are all pirated and a lot of them would not be supported by the players at home as most of them are not region coded!"

Just NAME it and you get it! Anything!!! You want, you get it here! Ladies & Gentlemen, welcome to Thamel!I have visited many places reliant on tourism. Thamel is one of them, undoubtedly! As it is the touristy/souvenir area of the city the pushy sellers are ready to take large profits off of clueless tourists. Not all stores try to rip you off though, but don't be shy when it comes to haggling and bargaining. After all, they aren\u2019t shy at the time of overpricing their stuff! Hawkers are a constant pestering and that can be annoying (almost impossible to look and shop without being bugged to buy something). However, good news: If the price of what you want to buy seems high to you (some items are REALLY expensive/overpriced, at least for a South American traveller like me), all you have to do is mention the price at which you would like to buy it and they will be happy to give it the price that you quoted (not always, of course!).Thamel can be exciting or down right annoying, depending on who visits it. It is always active, always crowded. Noisy, crammed. Full of polite people who seem to be the descendants of the hippies of the 70's. Drugs fairly openly offered on the streets. You will never feel lonely in this city! Thamel has a bit of everything. It boasts of excellent eateries with many different cuisine, a place to hang out for the locals, a lively fun place, sometimes a bit dirty, always very busy. Should you want to be harassed, the place to go! Oddly, despite all its drawbacks, Thamel has become, the major tourist attraction in Kathmandu, mainly for young people. The atmosphere is that of Carnaby Street , London by the end of the 70s they say. Yes, Thamel has something for everyone!But before heading to Thamel, ask yourself if it a place for you. Not everybody\u2019s cup of tea!If you are a brave traveller, it can be fun! Its narrow sidewalks, its pot-holed streets jammed with honking cars (crazy traffic though you soon learn how to walk with it - literrally), motorbikes, bicycle carts and tourists offer a much more interesting atmosphere than the wider and more elegant boulevard areas. Enjoy it! Love it! Or leave it soon! U choose!"

Thamel is made for tourists - it's essentially the modification of a neighbourhood into a shopping/bar/restaurant area with inflated prices. Some tourists don't mind this, in fact, some love it. Even some locals who can afford spending their nights at the countless bars and music venues love coming here. I would recommend ignoring all the people who try to sell you something while you walk down the street, as they are only interested in turning in a large profit off of clueless tourists. Not all stores try to rip you off though, but don't be shy when it comes to haggling and bargaining. It would be good to have an idea of what the price of an item should be, and you can even ask at your reception desk before going out hunting.However, if you are the sort that would rather stay somewhere with a more local feel, I would recommend you stay away from Thamel. Or, at least, not to spend a significant amount of time in Thamel if you are staying at a hotel there. As I come from a country reliant on tourism, I have seen similar areas in my own country, and recognized it straight away. I didn't let it affect my stay though, and spent most of my days away from Thamel, even though I was staying in a hotel there (which was a great hotel to be honest)."

The shops have elegant colors and smells. Lots of restaurants, souvenir shops, low and medium budget hotels. But one need to be careful about the price which is much higher than other places of Kathmandu. And it's not wise to buy antics from Thamel, which are most cases made in Patan area. The massage places are not also authentic in most cases."

It is a maze of narrow streets and alleys offering everything you could ever want. It is becoming a tourist attraction in itself. The shops, tour agencies, massage centers, and restaurants are truly colorful and overwhelming. Compared to the rest of this noisy and crazy city, Thamel is clean and attractive. But all the signs in Thamel obviously give it a cluttered look. Fortunately they're not all in neon, but that would be impossible given the power blackouts. Yes, everyone pestering you for this or that can get annoying. But I guess you have to not let it get to you, and let it go. I loved Thamel. For me, it was the restaurants and the bars. By the way, there are plenty of choices of lodging outside Thamel, you don't HAVE TO stay there. Thamel is an escape. You're on vacation in Nepal, so enjoy yourself. And you can always leave Thamel. Thamel has something for everyone."

It's barmy and it's easy to get lost in, but it's safe (or appears to be) but would suggest getting a taxi if in doubt. I would suggest checking out as many of the streets and shops as you can before buying anything as prices vary hugely. One trick is to go into a shop and discover the lowest price they'll go to and then go to a street seller and start negotiating down from there. You'll usually find that you'll get it for paractically nothing compared with the original price. For instance - starting at 3,500 rupees with a street seller, often ends up at 70 rupees. . . just do it with a smile."

The hotel is located few blocks from the main Thamel road. I highly recommend this hotel for those wanting comfort and a great location but travel on a budget."

It is the exact opposite of what you experience in a Western country, which is one of the main reasons why we travel to countries like Nepal in the first place.

Its narrow streets are a hive of activity with pedestrians, cars, small trucks and motor bikes all sharing the roadways. It's full of shops for hiking gear, t-shirts (printed) and embroidered; the latter will embroider whatever you want on a t-shirt for less than a printed t-shirt in most other tourist locations. You have to bargain for most things, and the shop keepers are generally good humoured about it. There are restaurants serving every kind of food you can imagine, ranging from local Nepali & Newari to Mexican and Japanese. Often one restaurant will serve multiple kinds of food, for example chow mein and pizza. Generally speaking the food is very good to excellent.Changing money was easy because there are exchange shops everywhere with their rates outside. They do not charge an extra commission, so you get the same rate whether you change $100 or $10.We felt safe walking in Thamel in daylight as well as in the evening.

My wife's favourite place on our recent trip. We were staying in the heart of Thamel so experienced both day and night and it was great. The only issue I had was the vehicles pushing through the narrow streets. For such a compact area you would have thought they'd make it pedestrian only, but who am I to say. Just watch out for some crazy car drivers and in particular the motor bikes as they speed through areas which are crowded. I didn't see anyone run over so maybe it just needs getting used to. I enjoyed this so much just walking around looking at the place that I didn't even mind my wife shopping. That's how good and interesting this place is."

Thamel is a seemingly endless labyrinth of commerce offering cheap hostels, abundant alcohol, illegal drugs, 'human services,' and of course, souvenirs ranging from the cheap and crappy (95%) to the unique and interesting. If it's for sale in Nepal, it can be found in Thamel - probably for less. It's where most trekkers and backpackers stay, and as such has become an institution unto itself, offering food, entertainment, even clothing uniquely suited to this infamously miserly crowd and not on offer anywhere else in Nepal (except in Pokhara, where the cheap trekkers and backpackers like to hang out to get away from Thamel). After a year in Nepal we managed to locate some truly unique shops where we could get a custom-made gong stand, for instance, or antique wood printing blocks. We also found that most t-shirt shops will custom make something for you at a very reasonable price. We even located a really fun rock-climbing wall suitable for children and adults and totally safe (it's next to the Belgian consulate). But mostly Thamel is shops selling the same stuff. After fifteen minutes you've seen about all you're going to see - like the backgrounds in Hanna-Barbera cartoons, it's just the same thing over and over and over. Don't waste your time in Thamel continuing to look for the elusive \"perfect\" souvenir. If you haven't seen it in the first fifteen minutes, you're not going to see it. A better option would be to go to Pulchowk and check out Mahaguthi, Dukuthi, and the other fair trade shops. Their stuff is much higher quality, truly unique, and, most importantly, it meets fair trade standards. While you will find a stunning array of foreigners in all manner of strange dress seeking pseudo-enlightenment (or cheap hash and beer) and cheap souvenirs, most people in Thamel are simply there, drawn by the spectacle of the foreigners in all manner of strange dress seeking pseudo-enlightenment and cheap souvenirs.

For travellers who have stayed in touristy places before (think Pai or Chiang Mai, Thailand; Dali, China; and plenty of others), there's little here of interest. And the men selling girls and gunja are a bit more creapy than in most places (at least in Dali it's the cute old bai women doing the selling, and they're completely harmless). I say - buy your pashminas, have a beer, then get out of Thamel and Kathmandu altogether and head for the hills."

I likes Thamel most compared to other areas in Kathmandu city because this area more clean, more safe, more comfortable, full of decent shops, hotels, restaurants, money changers, tour agencies, easy to get transports, near to tourist attractions, and walking distance to tourist bus station. So many shops in Thamel, the most prominent shops are shops selling mountain climbing and trekking attaires, tools and equipments, then shops selling locals/natives handicraft such as clothes, shawls, scarfs, caps, gloves, and socks made from wool, yak or silk. Here also many bookshops selling books/magazines mostly about Nepal, Mountain, Trekking, Mountain Climbing, White Water Rafting, Mountain biking, Yoga, Meditation. Supermarket and Bakery shop are easy to find in Thamel. Everythings are within our reach. The most important thing in Thamel electricity supplied longer hours (6-8 hrs per day) compare to other areas in Kathmandu, and most of the hotels and shops in this area has their own power generator."

If you come to Nepal looking for Buddhist peace, or Nepalese temples, or ancient mountain kingdoms, or 5 star quality and hygeine, you aren't going to find it in Thamel. Its more like a cold weather verson of Kuta in Bali or Khaosan Road in Bangkok. Its just as dirty, seedy, noisy, colourful and vibrant and caters predominantly to foreign, young-at-heart trekkers and travellers.The place is a virtual ghetto. It is a labyrinth of narrow lanes and alleys in the old centre of Kathmandu, not far from Durbar Square. Potholed and cobblestoned roads in Thamel were designed eons ago for foot traffic, so struggle with vehicles. Motorbikes still wind through though, along with bicycle rickshaws, and tiny taxis squeezing to get past each other. The narrow lanes are jam packed with shops selling Nepali souvenirs, embroidery, cashmere/pashmina, pirated music and DVDs, cheap accommodation, and a huge variety of restaurants and bars. There are multitudes of travel agencies arranging Himalayan treks and tours, and shops selling outdoor trekking, climbing and cold weather equipment - some genuine, but the vast majority well made counterfeits imported from China and sold at ridiculously low prices. Shop touts are determined hustlers and you are expected to bargain hard. During the day, the area is a hive of shopping activity. At night it takes on a gaudy and seedy, multi-coloured quality, particularly in the heart of Thamel as the upstairs nightclubs and basement dives crank up the volume. Personally, I enjoy the place and the vibe that goes with it. The I love to travel, and am lucky enough to travel to Kathmandu on a semi regular basis. Although I now stay in better quality hotels than the majority of those in Thamel, I still love to return here to wander, shop, eat, drink, and chill out. It is a crossroads of travellers, tourists and trekkers, from every nationality and walk of life.The first time I ever visited was to trek the Annapurna Circuit, almost 25 years ago. At that time I stayed in the Kathmandu Guest House, right in the centre of Thamel. The more things change - the more they stay the same and I swear that the Thamel doesn't seem to have changed since I was here decades ago. Sure, the everything is more modern, but the place has a deja vu quality about it that is quite timeless."

Shopping is also very good and cheap, but obviously, you have to be prepared to haggle everyone, from guest house, to taxi drivers etc... as everyone will try to rip you off as much as they can.Well worth wondering around and also walking from thamel to some of the other attractions such as Durbar Square, as you will see interesting street scenes along the way."

I however was disgusted its the most westernized part of Nepal it mimic's most tourist centers around the US and Europe cheap low quality good made specifically for touristic. Its not the good's that Nepali people are buying/wearing you see goofy white folks in cotton parachute pants and hippy-esk attire when I have yet to see native's wear much besides kurta's and teeshirt/jean combos. As for the food its rice and lentil's (at super inflated prices compared to anywhere else in KTM) are available but most restaurants make strong attempts at failed western cuisine (to there credit its not there fault the proper ingredients just are not imported into the country to make it correctly). It is however on of afew areas that brewed coffee (non-Nescafe) are possible. Hot water showers are at most hotels some time during the day. During the day any tourist is subject to aggressive peddlers of Tiger balm, cab rides, squeaky instruments, and more. At night the same peddlers are present but they have switched to selling illicit drugs and \"full body massage\" making it almost not worth the hassle of being on the streets at night. One thing to note is that at no point did my safety seem compromised, personal spacial boundaries yes people get right up on you without thinking twice. The music scene seem rather active, bands played at may venues every night generally covering radio classic's with surprising accuracy, there was however a prominent punk/hardcore circuit that played atleast once a week I think they may have been the bands in different lineups they all sounded a touch like the NYC band \"Leftover Crack\" I'll leave it at that. From the Nepali side I know many Nepali native that love Thamel for the happening nightlife but this is only because this is as good as it gets in this county its about as happening as small college town in offseason and most establishments are done and shut down but 12. I hate to be the cynic but I also love to hate on the \"tourist scene\" if your in KTM by all means go people will ask you about every time you mention you have been to Nepal but like so many other places in the world its does not live up the hype its given."

Although prices tend to be significantly higher than non-tourist areas, food hygiene is generally a lot better too. Thamel also acts as the pre-base camp for mountaineers.

Take your time and be firm to negotiate; the first price is sure to be at least double the selling price. You have to be able to walk away to get the right price. It is easy enough to get rid of the occasional drug pusher. The sellets are not that annoying that their hawking becomes a bother; they tend to be polite and not too insistent. If you start asking for a price for something, be ready for a long process because they will only let you go if your price is way too low. A fun experience. I did not experience or get wind of any theft of dishonesty in my 4 visits to Thamel. There is a fair amount of police on hand."

I was looking forward to the visit since it is supposedly a UNESCO World Heritage Site and I have visited many other World Heritage Sites around the globe with great pleasure. I confess, however, to complete disappointment in the sad reality of Kathmandu, which is a capital in a state of serious deterioration. The city is polluted, crowded, filthy and almost totally without aesthetic merit. The city's Durbar Square, though crammed with ancient structures, is tragic to see. The once beautiful monuments are falling into pieces and offer only shadows of past beauty. Foreigners pay to enter the Square (supposedly the money is devoted to restoration efforts), but I saw little evidence of restoration in process. Interesting shopping can certainly be done in the little shops in Thamel, but be prepared for filthy conditions along the road (wear a dust mask for sure) and dangerous street crossings. There are no street lights and streets are packed with motorbikes, cars, buses and bicycles that follow a logic of their own. Beyond Kathmandu, it is worth seeing Swayambhunath (the Monkey Temple, northwest of the city), Bodhnath (the large Buddhist stupa east of the city), and the Durbar Square of Patan, an ancient sister city south of Kathmandu which is in a better state of repair than Kathmandu. In general, however, I would advise travelers coming to Nepal for a trek to minimize their stay in Kathmandu. There is very little here worth seeing, sad to say. Remember to drink NO TAP WATER at all and to completely avoid uncooked vegetables and unpeeled fruits. Sanitation is poor here. I have only admiration for the local people I encountered in Kathmandu, however, who were uniformly helpful and polite. These people clearly deserve better from their government!"

Then, for the next 47 touts, I can pull my little tin out of my pocket and show them that I already have it. The one Nepali phrase you should learn to shop in Thamel is \"Chi Di nah\" (I don't want it). The touts can be relentless if you show any interest in their product at all.The resturants are risky. There is no guarantee of quality or safe food preparation, so it's easy to get sick. All in all, I would say Thamel should be seen once just because it is an interesting experience.

A backpackers' area, it is so common to see so many backpackers in the streets. It is also very small, so it's easy to get from one place to another -- from mountain gear stores to souvenir shops to hostels to travel agencies to restaurant of different cuisines. It is a poor country, so the roads and transportation is not great, but it's interesting to explore the character of urban Nepal."

Then negotiate to 1/2 of the new rate and your starting 1/2 price...

There are alot of shops selling trekking gears and apparels at inexpensive prices (however note that they may not be authentic). But still a good place to buy stuff such as fleece jacket and linen which may be helpful if you are trekking during the winter season and needed some extras. I remembered buying the fleece linen at around 10-15USD. Ornament souvenirs and cashmere/pashima scarfs are also sold there but only buy if you are sure of the quality.

Lots of open stalls where goods are sold at low prices. Many jewelry stores but I was not certain of the authenticiy of gems and value of jewelry. Know your merchandise before buying. I felt more comfortable buying trekking gear which was perhaps a third of cost back home, if not better. Negotiating is an art. Merchants expect customers to negotiate. Even currency exchange will negotiate."

For me, not that interesting but I am sure others will like it.Regardless of my aversion to the shops, it's still a nice place to spend a few hours before retiring for lunch or cocktails."

Bustling with tourists, vendors calling to tourists, vehicles weaving their way down one lane streets though people, cars & motorcycles, and the ever present smell of incense, Thamel is a unique place. If you complain about Thamel it because you don't accept Kathmandu for what it is...There is dust, there is exhaust fumes, you're usually walking in the gutter (there are no footpaths). If you stay for more than a day, I recommend a mask as you walk the streets.The store owners will say \"Namaste\" as you walk past, so please be polite and reply with the same or just a smile. If you do just want to look around (it is free), they are helpful, and enthusiastic. Some may find that pushy, but these are salespeople. A gentle \"no\" and all is fine. Grocery stores, laundry services, fair trade clothing, and all manner of hand made goods are available for barter and a fair price."

The walks into the labyrinth of alleyways and streets filled with objects, people, and meat were nothing short of mini-adventures into another world. We never felt unsafe though, but we also always kept our minds about us, dressed appropriately, and never had a lot of valuable with us.

Though one cannot fail to notice overwhelming socio-cultural influence of India,there is stark difference of opinion when it comes to Sex,Sensuality or even the larger issue of status of Women in Nepal vis-a-vis India. Being an Avid travelling I've traveled across the length and breath of Indian Sub-continent., yet nowhere one can find women as empowered as they are in Nepal. The retail sector is mostly manned by women; be it the groceries or slaughter houses, women are simply everywhere.( INFACT MOST OF THE BUTCHERS IN THAMEL AREA ARE WOMEN) Prostitution though rampart, is yet illegal in India. The sex workers and their pimps are mostly cast away in the darkest corners of the town. Men from decent families fear being sighted in the so called 'Red Light' areas. The prostitutes cannot be imagined to co-exist in a decent neighborhood. There is a sense of hopelessness and despair amidst the artificial projection of festivity in prostitution dens;But Nepal was different. The pimps are not apologetic; Sex workers themselves are not ashamed of their profession. Kathmandu's Sin City, strangely harmoniously coexists within a regular neighborhood . This was something that I found particularly striking. This was closest I got to Nagaras and Mahajanpadas described in Kamasutra. Consistent subjugation and foreign invasions in the past millennium have destroyed what would have been a similar culture in India. Though western influence seems evident in the dressing sense and atticates. The routes of this culture of liberalism are deeper.After 8 pm,Thamel region comes to full glory. Be prepared to be pitched by pimps who offer literally everything a Man could ask for. Cocaine, Marijuana, Hash Weed LSD, Sex, Massage all this within a bustling bazaar. in the center of City! Thamel also offer perhaps the best option for shopping if you are travelling on a Low budget. the variety and quality of goods available here is comparable to the best in South Asia if not better. However be prepared to listen to cheesy propositions as you are lost in the shopping experiences. I was moving out of a popular shopping joint when a pimp said \"Sir, would you like to Jump and Pump?"

Yes, you will pay much more here than if you were to find the same items just 1/4 mile away, but at least this can give you a reason to bargain with all the shopkeepers. Buy the art, necklaces, curios, etc. because you never know who might need a gift back home. To give an example of the bargaining that can take place- We started by looking at art and the first price we got in the heart of Thamel was about 8000 rupees. The exact same piece of art 2 block away and 4 days later was now 2500 rupees. Don't feel bad to make low offers, especially if you are going to be there for a few days."

Particularly the accomodation choice. I personally like Thamel for is the wide range of available trekking gear at the incredibly comfy rates, good selection of books (if you are passionate reader, you must visit Piligrims Bookshop) and music CD's. Stay here for 2-3 days maximum to arrange your trip through any of numerous travel agencies around (and you can get pretty good deals), to stock up on missing trekking gear, to have some original coffee and genuine German bakery and to spend your last Nepali rupees on souvenirs for friends and family back home."

            "review": "Thamel is NOT Nepal. Thamel is the tourist ghetto of Kathmandu, where all things 'western' are available -- from Swiss chocolate to French wine, Japanese cameras, Irish pubs, English football, Italian coffee, German sausages, Australian didgeridoos American beefburgers and Austrian beer (happy hour), not to mention the Swedish massage (happy ending). Of course most imported goods are actually made in China, whatever the label might say (check out the Adidas, Nike etc. label shops on Paknajol, the street adjoining Thamel). Mornings can be spent eating bacon and eggs covered with a synthetic honey, afternoon can find you surfing the cold-coffee bars with free Wi-fi, and evenings can be spent prancing about like a puppet at the Fire Club, or else, if you prefer more local customs, joining in with the Nepalese and Indian men in the P**sy Bar (with shower).Thamel has certainly got sleazier and sleazier over the years and more aggressive too, especially when the clubs turn out around midnight. It's getting expensive, too, for although guest houses are still relatively cheap (around 10 dollars), food and drink prices (including the Italian coffee), have rocketed. Most shopkeepers, although not all, are out to cheat you, quality of goods is shoddy and/or counterfeit. Thamel is fun for a few days but don't get hooked (or run down by a crazed youth on a 250cc scrambler). Go trekking or out to some small town -- see how most people live, see the real Nepal, because Thamel (Kathmandu) definitely isn't it)."

            "review": "I am surprised at the negativity of previous reviews. I have to say that I surprised at the negativity of previous reviews of Thamel. I have come visited Thamel over the past two decades. In that time it has changed remarkably little while the rest of Kathmandu grows and sprawls around it. It is quite a unique place in the world, even within Kathmandu, and I wonder if some of the frequently negative comments come from people who have not travelled widely or have little experience in such environments.Thamel is a loud and crowded backpackers and trekkers ghetto in the centre of Kathmandu. It is a small maze of narrow lanes, packed tightly with cafes, restaurants, budget accommodation, discount bookstores, jewellery shops, thanka and art shops, and many, many shops selling expeditionery and trekking gear. Some of that gear is top end and imported, some is left over from previous mountaineering expeditions, but a great deal of it is \"North Fake\" style counterfeit outdoor brands, such as North Face, Columbia, etc. The gear is likely to be goretex, but not genuine brand - amazingly cheap prices for take home purchases, but I wouldn't necessarily stake my life on it in the mountains.Thamel becomes a loud nightspot in the evenings, with many music bars, and young travellers looking for a good time. And there are plenty of good times to be had. There is definitely a seedy side to the Thamel night life, and you are still likely to be approached on the street by someone whispering of a possible drug deal, or similar. Avoid these at all costs. Frequent the popular bars, night spots, and only stay at the better budget guesthouses recommended by Tripadvisor, and you will be fine. But like many similar precincts around the world, you need to act sensibly and keep your street smarts about you. Watch your belongings at all times, don't be pursuaded to make purchases that are too good to be true, and don't seek outout the dingy back street places, drugs etc or you may end up getting yourself into trouble or being ripped off very quickly. I always enjoy returning to Kathmandu, and even though nowadays I no longer stay in budget accommodation, without fail I always visit Thamel at least one evening per visit, to shop for bargains for the family and enjoy a fun night out!"

            "review": "A must see while in Kathmandu...but be careful. When you go to Nepal to go trekking, while in Kathmandu you have to visit Thamel just to see what its all about.Thamel is a area of Kathmandu with tons of little hole-in-the-wall shops that sell fake name brand trekking and climbing gear. It is a great place to find souvenirs and any gear you may have forgotten at home (just know that it is fake). There are a couple of 'real' shops like Mountain Hardwear, North Face, and Lowe Alpine.Just be careful when walking around this area. It is a known tourist hot spot so there are plenty of people there to take advantage of you. There are several beggars on the streets and many stray dogs that sleep during the day. Don't carry anything in your back pockets and if you carry a backpack make sure you have it zipped and many people wear them on their fronts so you keep your belongings close.After dark the scene in Thamel changes. ANYTHING can be bought in Thamel after dark.If you planning on being out after dark on the streets of Kathmandu you had better bring a headlamp because there are very few street lights and the sidewalks get really dark.Overall, I would definately recommend going to Thamel, just do so with caution. If you are careful and don't get yourself into bad situations, you will have fun."

I love this place.Particularly at night time this place is alive, not that you will see anything due to lack of lighting, this is what makes it such a cool place to be. Just watch out for passing motorbikes which seem to fly past in all directions. The best tip I can give anyone is to haggle your a** off with the guys if you are interested in buying but if not be polite and just say no thanks. They are keen salesmen but are not aggressive and enjoy the banter. There are some excellent places to eat here, not that I can remember the names but as always be careful what you eat. That goes for all places in Kathmandu. I didn't feel unsafe here at any time but we were never down there too late at night. Stick to the main street maybe as a precaution.Enjoy"

These hoteliers only care about dollar/euro carrying people, they even wont give rooms ( paying same amount as others) and if you find one, it will be the worst room in the hotel..( there will be TV but no remote, phones will not work). If you ask about remote they will say it has been given to other guests ( read other as people with dollar/euro). I am a nepali and i felt humiliated by fellow nepalese in Thamel, i sincerely believe one day all tourists stop coming to this horrible place and than only those hoteliers will realize how to do business. Dollar/Euro carrying tourist be warned that they charge you too much, i recommend you all to look for accomodation elsewhere in KTM..simply said hotelier at thamel sucks!!"

Thamel is brash, bustling, crowded, touristy, and a curious Nepalese arrempt to provide what the locals perceive that western tourists want. An authentic Nepalese experience it isn't.If you want a range of good hotels, myriad restaurants (some very good, others less so), loads of shops selling (some) good stuff and (lots of) tourist tat, a huge choice of cyber-cafes, a couple of supermarkets, bars belting out western music, crowded streets, lots of traffic, rickshaw hawkers etc. then it's the place to be. Bear in mind that a ten minute walk will bring you to many other shops selling similar stuff, but probably much cheaper !Give it a go for a couple of days - it's a fun place to unwind after a trek, but don't imagine that it's Real Nepal. If you've only limited time available you'll get a different, but highly enjoyable experience by spending a couple of days in Bhaktapur"
