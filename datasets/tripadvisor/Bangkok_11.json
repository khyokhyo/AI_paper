The place is accessible. It is hot though and revealing clothes are not allowed but a good 1-2hrs stay will do. Instagram worthy photos can be taken here!"

We ended up getting to the temple prettying late and weren't sure if they'd even let us climb up but not only were we allowed to enter, but they let us pass for free. Up top we got a beautiful of Bangkok at night and got to see some nice Buddahs and a really interesting statue that exemplifies how they used to dispose of their dead and the problems that arose because of it. Super interesting"

Hard to believe that this was the tallest landmark of Bangkok before skyscraper popped up. Enjoy the nice walk way with some nice city views. The place is perfectly connected via boat to the city center (eg close to Central World) or the Chao Phraya River. Also the surrounding is worth to explore. A great place also for Non Buddhists."

Take into consideration that you will have to climb several steps in order to reach the \"golden tresure\". Because on the top of the mountain you will be given with my favourite view from Bangkok, the old city with traditional red-roofted buildings, narrow streets and green-coloured, and in the background, the new Bangkok with the new sky-scrappers, most of them renamed hotels. The temple is not bad but nothing espectacular. As always, you can get a blessing by buying stuff to the monks. Water, which you will need after all the climbing, is being sold inside the temple. The roof-top is the most interesting part of the temple with its golden pagoda. How to reach there: tuk-tuk from royal palace 100 THB (after a tough bargaining with several drivers). Tuk-tuk to silom road 130 THB"

Though the stair way is no boring so you could stop many times for different views of city and to take pictures.The entry is not costly and the temple is crowded like other overrated temples.At the end when you reach the top you will feel that this is the best of the temples and the 360 view is great.Tips:- No dress code here but wear modestly.- Go here early in the morning to avoid heat and even little crowd.- Stairs so carry water with you.- Don't listen to scammers saying it is close.Reaching here:- Go to any canal boat stop (Google for this)- Take Canal boat (Long tail) to Phanfa Bridge (7-Eleven here)- Walk to Wat Saket (Short distance)"

The entry fee of 20 Baht is very rectified and their souvenir shop prices are very considerable as well. It is a little bit difficult to get there but it is not overcrowded which makes the experience even better. All employees and monks are very nice and helpful and the view over Bangkok is one of the best you will get for this price!Afterwards I recommend to walk trough the surrounding area and to visit the much underrated King Prajadhipok Museum which is right next to the hill. Afterwards you can take the water bus back to the city center which is an amazing experience itself and a nice finish to the visit. (The station is a little difficult to find, ask locals or museum staff for the water bus station!)"

The temple itself is quite pretty, and the entrance price is very cheap. One other advantage is that there were very few tourists there. Perhaps the reason for this is that the temple is a bit out of the way from some other sights, certainly not walkable from any form of public transportation. While it was a very nice experience, considering its location and the number of other impressive temples in Bangkok, I wouldn't rank it a 'must-see' sight at all."

You get panoramic views of the city from here and there is beautiful a Stupa at the top. Like a lot of temples the steps are there for a reason, not just get there, they are like a discipline, a hardship to make you grateful once to reach the top.There are water features around the hill as you climb, but some do look a bit tacky but I enjoyed being here none the less. If you have already seen several Buddhist temples you may not want to bother. There is a coffee shop about half way up that does a lovely coffee."

I've been there on relatively busy days, but it's never overcrowded - and I've been there on days where there isn't another soul in sight. A wonderful place. It's unlike all the other temples, and situated within walking distance of Town Hall, numerous other wats, and the Khaoson Rd precinct.

Midway there is a caf\u00e9 for cold drinks and ice cream. Once you reach the top, this is one temple that they are not that strict with the dress code and you keep your shoes. Go around and enjoy the smaller images then take the wooden stairs to the right tucked in an alcove and go to the rooftop to enjoy views of Bangkok and see devotees offering prayers. On the way down, you can take another route and see this giant Buddha inside a smaller temple with glass walls. Trying to get to Wat Ratchanada also known as the Loha Prasat, we got detoured and stumbled on an empty temple with a wide plaza...golden buddhas in a straight line surrounding the main temple....all to ourselves as this was already around noon. We got here by taxi from Wat traimit, cost us around 40baht. There are so many taxis in Bangkok, might be a good idea to have the hotel staff to write down the places where you want to go in Thai, so there will be no misunderstanding. They will try to negotiate price, just say \"meter\", they say no, close the door and flag down another taxi."

Upon arrival at the said attraction, somehow and sadly, our driver had managed to forget all of the English he had learnt in his lifetime, and couldn't communicate with us - he needed a fellow tuk-tuk driver to interpret his words to us - detailing a sudden plight that had afflicted our driver. We were advised that the driver had gone blind and needed to go. I couldn't imagine what illness had struck him to deprive him of his English and his sight - the world can be such a cruel and merciless place. With no cure to hand, we set off up the steps anyway and at one point turned around to then see our driver driving away in his tuk-tuk. Maybe it was the power of the Mount. Didn't mind being ripped off, though, due to the insane nature of his deceit. Anyway, the Golden Mount was alright - worth double the cost of a journey to it."

The golden peak, like so many temples in Bangkok, offers amazing views across the city. Inside is beautifully peaceful and not aimed specifically at tourists. Well worth a visit!"

            "review": "How to get here by Bus and Khlong. Why is there so many description about the temple but so hard to describe how to get here ?OK. .here goes. I took 2 mode of transportation to get to Wat Saket (went by bus and returned by Khlong River Boat)I took the BTS all the way to National Stadium. From here I walk towards the entrance to MBK but took the stairs down to my right where there's lots of Tuk Tuk and motor taxi (con men and vultures) waiting for tourist. They quoted 150 baht just by motor taxi to Wat Saket. Those blood sucking worms. Walk further down to the bus stop about 60 meters from the National Stadium. Look at the Board at the bus stop and make sure it says and point to the INBOUND direction. If it says OUTBOUND than u are at the wrong side of the road. Wait for bus number 15 or 47. (I took 15) and it will drive u all the way straight near to areas near Wat Saket. I had my Google Map ready and even if ur GPS shows detour, DONT WORRY. the bus drove pass by Wat Saket (you can see it with the Golden Stupa about 15 min from where I took the bus). The nearest stop there is the MAHAKORN FORT. How do u know if u have reach MAHAKORN FORT ? Look to ur left. It is the only building with cannons sticking out of it. That's when u press the bell to get off. Wat Saket is just 7 min walk to your left as u got off the bus. Follow the stupa. Bus cost me 11 baht.Another easy way which was the easiest is the Khlong. I took the MRT (not BTS) to Petchaburi station. Follow exit number 2. ASOK PIER and once exit follow right. Walk and the Pier is just 1 min from the Exit 2 of Petchaburi station. Take a 10 baht (yes...10 baht only) river boat and make sure you ask if the boat goes to Pratunam. Pratunam is the last stop. Once u get to Pratunam, get off and cross the bridge to the other side of the river. This time get on the boat and follow direction to PANFA LEELARD Pier. (All boat here stops and Pratunam, that is why u have to change boat). PANFA LEELARD Pier is also the last Pier and this is where Wat Saket is located. Just a stone throw away. It's another 10 baht so total you spend 20 baht.So very easy. Last station PANFA LEELARD for Wat Saket when you get on from Pratunam and last station Pratunam when you get on from ASOK Pier. The best part is once u r done with Wat Saket, you can get back on the boat and stop at Pratunam to do shopping. After that, back to the Pratunam Pier and on the boat to the nearest MRT which is ASOK-PETCHABURI pier (some people just call it ASOK Pier)Please try this and don't get cheated with taxi and Tuk Tuk. The boat was much much easier.This link below helps to explain each station pier where the boat stops at. Use this.http://khlongsaensaep.com/lines-route-map.html"

Originally it was a temple known as Wat Sakae in the Ayutthaya period until Rama I moved the capital to modern-day Bangkok. The hill is artificial and based on a former structure that was abandoned in the era of Rama III. By the early 20th Century a chedi was constructed and reinforced by concrete in the 1940s. Today the chedi overlooks the Pom Prap Sattru Phai area and gives an impressive view of the city. Wat Saket is in itself an impressive site, however, there are some caveats. Be aware of the 300 or so stairs; it is not easily accessible by the elderly or infirm. Also, the site is generally swamped with tourists during peak season, usually coming within an hour after the opening time of 8:00. Prepare to be asked for the entry fee of around 20 baht, especially during the middle of the day; it may have gone well up since then. The surrounding complex is nothing special other than a few bizarre statues. The attraction is really the large chedi and the great view of the surrounding area. Definitely worth a visit."

This is a fantastic place also, views, setting, architecture, so certainly, go, if you appreciate temples and would like to join the devotees. How to get there: I recommend taking the BTS to National Stadium, taking exit 1, and then taking one of the many tuk-tuks there (less than \u20ac 2.50).How to approach: The steps are easy if you are at all mobile, there are excellent handrails. You do NOT need to remove your shoes, and although this is a Royal temple, knee-covering non-long pants are fine. In fact, if it's wet, you definitely shouldn't; this is slippery. You may use your parasol as well.Once there: The main Buddha shrine is one floor below the terrace. The terrace features the golden stupa itself. There is an astroturf walkway around it; for this, remove your shoes and circumambulate clock-wise (say, three times) if you want.Just after and before closing and/or during or after some rain is the best time to go here. But again, slippery when wet!"

Modern skyscrapers, ancient rich temples, shabby houses.The temple itself is not extraordinary, also you can buy some drink and ice-cream inside, so one does not really feel the sacrum. :)On top of the roof, just above a beautiful old gong, somebody proudly announces about Golden Mountain Free Wifi.The symbol of our times. ;)"

After climbing 320 stairs I reached the top of the shrine and enjoyed the panoramic views of the Rattanakosin Island and the Bangkok City around. Monastries and pagodas can be seen around the mount . The relics of Bhudda have been enshrined in the pagoda on the top of the Golden Mount.i saw many locals worshipping in the shrine at the top. And after tiring in hot sun I walked down the mount .

The Golden Mount is a very beautiful temple at the top of the hill. There were of course lots of stairs, so if you have back or leg problems, this will be a hard one. But when you get at the top, besides the beautiful temple, you have a fantastic view of Bangkok which is worth the effort. So if you are a healthy person with good physics, don't miss this temple."

It doesn't have some well-known buddha to draw tourists but, to me, it offers a more peaceful experience as well as this incredible 360 degree view of the city. It only cost 20 baht to enter and this involves 300+ red steps that wind up to the top. The steps are not steep and as you climb you can ring the bells along the way as well as enjoy the tone of the gongs. There is nothing fancy here but once you duck your head and climb the last steps up to the open-air top you will appreciate the effort it took to get here. The gold top with its lavender ribbon surround looks better close up than afar. Soak in the view of Bangkok from each angle, smog or no smog. Enjoy the easier journey down the steps and at the exit (different than the entrance) there is a large gong that absolutely beckons your involvement as it bellows out this wonderfully low vibrating song that will draw the attention of anyone that has passed it by. Of all the Wats i would return to in Bangkok it would be Wat Arun and Wat Saket. It is not located in such proximity that one could easily figure out public transit though there is a specific water taxi (sorry i don't know the name of it or the particular canal) on a canal directly north of Wat Saket that ultimately gets you close to the Jim Thompson House and the National Stadium BTS (Skytrain) station. Of course there are always taxis and tuk tuks."

You certainly don't have to be Buddhist to visit, but if you are, you will get a lot more out of it. Regardless, the view at the top is great and it's worth a visit either way."

ALTHOUGH I have been to Bangkok many times this was my first visit to the Golden Mount or Wat Saket as it is known.I was staying in Sukhumvit so I hailed a tuk tuk and then just sat back and enjoyed the ride to the Mount for 200 baht or about \u00a34, watching all the traffic chaos and sights along the way.You need to be on your toes when you arrive since drop-off points for taxis and tuk tuks can be away from the main ascent of 350+ steps which is awkward because steps are not very wide.Entry is free but you get a shock very early on when you reach a display showing a group of vultures eating a human corpse! This is actually a bit of a history lesson about times gone by when bodies were laid out for consumption by vultures in order to clear up the dead and prevent the spread of disease. Still quite a startling sight to come across. Not your usual statuary!I followed the steps up circling the mount, birds calling sharply in the trees below, and eventually reached the top where there were various prayer points, stalls for offerings and a few souvenirs.Climbing up to the very top, I stepped out on to a square terrace with various statues where I learnt that the Mount was ordered built by King Rama III and was completed under the guidance of King Rama IV and King Rama V.The views over the nearby city were good although conditions were a little cloudy and hazy.The descent also allowed more appreciation of my wider surroundings since I\u2019d really focussed on the steps during my climb up.Back at the bottom I browsed a few stalls and then realised I\u2019d made a big mistake. I\u2019d paid off my tuk tuk driver and had the devil\u2019s own job finding another. Anyone visiting the Golden Mount might do well to negotiate their tuk tuk driver waiting an hour for them since the climb up only took about 15 minutes and the climb down about the same leaving half an hour to stroll round on top. An hour is plenty for what is here.Also, those visiting can move to the right of the entrance and find public toilets there which are best used before starting the climb up. They were clean and well looked after when I was there."

Wat Saket Ratcha Wora Maha Wihan (usually shortened to Wat Saket) is popularly known as the ancient Buddhist temple (Wat), the Temple of the Golden Mount, or 'Phu Khao Thong', on the Rattanakosin Island, in the heart of Bangkok, near the Grand Palace. It is one of the beautiful attractions of the capital: a low man-made hill inside the Wat, constructed under King Rama III (1824-51), completed and crowned with a gleaming gold Sri Lankan-style chedi in the reign of King Rama IV to contain the Indian relics of the Lord Buddha. It is absolutely a thing to do, or better say to do not miss it! There are 318 steps from downstairs to the top. Yes, you did get right: stairs, but when you stop your feet on the last step you will not feel tired after you did rise all of it and you will forget it in a blink of your eyes to make clear and believable 100 percent your sight, turning round 360 degrees your head and enjoying an amazing panoramic view with a fresh wind, avoiding to take pictures as many real travelers and locals do, because it is a sacred destination. Bangkok Post officially recommends to visit this beautiful place, especially during the period from last week of October to mid-November, when there is an annual fair held on the 12th lunar month, for a period of nine days of full moon. Yes, unbelievable, maybe you saw some photos with a cloth colored as the monk's robe and placed around the Golden Mount. At that time the temple grounds hosts Thai traditional theatre, there are food stalls and happen some shows."

It takes patience but I think tourist who can't speak Thai can seldom succeed) to this place took less than 30mins. There was a famous pad Thai street food stall nearby. Once got off the taxi, walked a very short distance and will reach a place with lots and lots of people. Along the side you will see many stalls selling mostly food. It's a bit of a walk (as there are just too many people) till you can get to the entrance of the Golden Mount, where you will see a Ferris wheel (not sure if it is there for the festival or a permanent thing). Just keep walking along the crowd and will see the entrance to the mountain with lots of small steps of stairs. It's not difficult to walk at all. Along the way you will notice there are bells and visitors can hit the bells with the rod inside the bell for (I suppose bringing good luck? Just guess...)... There were about two levels with Buddha statues and some priests blessing people.By the time you reached to the top you I got completely soaked! The centre of the square has a big bell shaped object covered with a red cloth. The interesting thing is that you will also notice some people taped a piece of 20B note to the wall of money next to a statue. Surrounded the bell shaped object is the priceless view of Bangkok city. One of the direction can see the old palace (I think). Getting back down was a pain as it was so jammed with people. You can enjoy the food or games once to got back down the road (it's better to go to the top first then chill when you got back down in my opinion)."

Now, there are lots of skyscrapers in Bangkok that offer fabulous views, but the Golden Mount is still a great place for a quiet, peaceful view of the city.

There is no shade on the top so do prepare for protection from the sun. Wat Saket is not near to any BTS station, so you may take tuk-tuk there. Alternatively, you can access it via Phan Fha pier (300m walk). From Phan Fha pier, we took the long tail boat to Pratunam. Take note that it can be VERY crowded and not much safety equipment in the boat, but certainly a very local experience!"

In my opinion, Wat Saket is the best temple in Bangkok, let me tell you the reasons.Firstly, the price was only 20 baht for foreigner, which is cheap if you compare it to other popular temples. Secondly, the atmosphere of the temple itself, peaceful and not too crowded, you'll see 3 wise monkeys at the entrance of Wat Saket, on the path to the top, there are some statues and bells (yes you can ring the bells), don't miss out the panoramic view of Bangkok as you go upstairs.Thirdly, the golden mount, where you can enjoy the breathtaking view, worship Buddha, take a look and pictures there, all covered in gold. There's also souvenir, drinks and ice cream stall.If you're more likely to stay in Khao San area, you can take 15 minutes walk to get there or simply take tuk tuk, motorbike or taxi. Don't forget to dress appropriately when entering the temple.Tips : get there in early morning, try to meditate, you'll find tranquility."

For anyone interested in going to Wat Saket please keep in mind there is no public transport, apart from the canal ferries, which will drop you near to this temple. In fact for anyone who hasn't been to Bangkok before I would highly recommend planning your trip and hotel stay around the the city's very efficient underground (MRT) and sky train (BTS) networks. The easiest way to get to Wat Saket, if you are staying around the Sukhumvit area, is to take the MRT to Petchaburi terminal. When you exit the terminal follow the indicating signs to the Canal ferry. It's approx 100 meters back along Asoke Road and for 15 Baht (US 50 cents) will take you all the way to Wat Saket. There is a change over at the half way point of the trip along the canal. Don't stress about this. just alight from the first ferry and wait on the platform to board the second one. If in doubt, just follow the crowd. The final stop is where you get off. It's at a bridge and you will be able able to see Wat Saket from the jetty. Ask the Tuk-Tuk guy's hanging around the bridge if you need more directions but it's just along the road and across the bridge. NOTE: the touts may try and talk you into going elsewhere, just say no and say \"Wat Saket.\""

KEEP YOUR SHOES ON. it is one of the rare places where you are asked to actually keep your shoes on. there were so many shoes at the down that I ignore the contant repetitive chant \"keep you shoes on\". when you get to the top the floor is painfully hot - I didn't have my shoes on. there is water at the top. there are graves or memorials around the base. good to get off the path and explore. look around there is more than just the mount. interesting tradition is to rub little gold squares on the black statues to pay respect. BEWARE AVOID WATCH OUT for the Tuk Tuk drivers. They over charge. If they don't over charge it is because they are going to take you to the THAI FACTORY a custom clothier. even if you don't want to go, they will take you there. It is horrible to feel kidnapped!

We caught the canal boat from the Pratunam Pier (located beneath the bridge on Ratchadamari Road, near the Pratunam Market) to the Phanfa Leelard stop (which is the last stop on canal heading towards the Chao Phraya river). It costs around 25 Baht per person each way and its a great way to see parts of the city you might not normally see.Once you get off the boat you go up the stairs and over the bridge and you'll see the Golden Mount to your left (you can't miss it) just down the street.Once you go in the entrance you need to go up a large flight of steps to get to the top. The walk is very pleasant, with nice views and stops on the way to rest up if you need it. Once you reach the top you are greated with a fantastic view of Bangkok. We spent a good 30 minutes just looking around at the view and seeing Bangkok layed at before you in all its glory. You can see attractions like the Rama Bridge, the Grand Palace and even Wat Arun from the top. Being up that high you also get a nice breeze which is most welcome in the Bangkok heat.Once you get back down to the ground there are other areas and temples to look at as well which help make this one of the must do things in Bangkok.We really enjoyed this and would recommend to everyone."

There are not as many people as the other popular temples so it looked surprisingly empty, and there is no specific dress code either (shorts and sleveless tops are ok).There are lots of stairs to climb but that's not too painful because the steps are not very high and the surroundings are really nice, green, with small cascades and statues hidden amidst the greenery. The atmosphere at the top where the golden bell is is very peaceful and relaxing and the view rewarding. A must see place."

The atmosphere is a relaxed one and the site provides a pleasant couple of hours. The gardens around the base and up the sides of the mount add to the atmosphere and there are excellent views out over surrounding Bangkok. There was also a small panorama explaining a little history of the site, especially during the Bangkok plague. A small charge for going up the mount. Quiet compared with the larger temples but well worth a visit for the Budhas, the gardens, the view and the history.If visiting by taxi, be sure to use a metered cab, 50 baht from khaosan area. A tuk tuk would cost several times more than that, as would an unmetered taxi. I see from other reviews it is also accessible by public boat service along the klongs (canal system)."

We took a water taxi that the locals used, very cheap but no English so we had to look at the line on the map and knew that ours was the last stop which made it easy. Going back, we had to remember land marks to know where to exit (fortunately we got on near the Jim Thompson house so had easy landmark). The ticket takers do not speak English and were not much help. The fare is very cheap and is an exciting way to travel and see the canal system and houses along the way. The water was very polluted and there was a water shield system where you pulled on a pulley and were protected from the splash. The Wat itself is visible but finding where to get in was hard. We got in through a little alley that had the smallest of signs. Once in the fee was cheap and the climb up the mount is not hard. There are rest areas along the way which makes it easy if you need them. Once at the top though, the view and breeze was fantastic. It is not that high but high enough to see all around the city 360. Definitely worth a trip and great photo op."

Once you reach the top there are many Buddha statues inside the temple for prayer and the most beautiful one would be the golden reclining Buddha statue. There is a way to go to the roof top of the temple where there is a golden stupa on the top. The view from the top of the temple is beautiful where you can see few popular destination like Wat Arun, grand palace and giant swing.If you are looking for a temple to visit in Bangkok, this one is definitely highly recommended."

What many not realise is the quitness away from the buzzing Bangkok streets and one of the most beatiful views over Bangkok from the top, combined with the nice walk upstairs. Wat Saket, or Golden Mount as it is called marks the border beween the old centre and the more modern part of Bangkok. It is easy accessibele with bus Connecting Lines 8, 15, 37, 47, 169 or by taxi, tuktuk. Admission used to be free, but recently 20 Baht entrance is required. Cheap drinks, snacks and icecream are available upstairs in the main building. Even a nice gardenstyle coffeespot has sprung up, where you can sit, drink and relax. Upstairs don't forget to pay a visit to the top structure, a big golden stupa or dome, wich gives this temple it's English nickname. It's accessible through the small stair in the coner. Mind you're head, as it is quit small and low ceiled. If you're lucky a processing is taking place, wich gives insight to the way Thais practice their religion. To avoid the heat while climbing bring an umbrella with you, like the Thais do, or visit the temple in the morning or afternoon hours."

We took the free tuk-tuk I suggest don't fall for it they will take you to ruby market and all that (as part of taking you to temples for free, it's kind of a gem advertisement, I guess) but be careful if you don't know how to handle them they will rip you off in the gem market and you will end up paying a lot more than you would actually pay for either the gem or the tuk tuk. Word of caution, if you are taking free ride don't buy anything in the places they take you to. Aside, the temple is very beautiful and more beautiful is the view of the city from the top.

You must climb up a series of steps that spiral around the Wat, similar to that of a mountain hence the name Golden Mountain. It is air conditioned too and throughout most of the day you will find many of the local people come here to pray, its a beautiful thing to witness. From the top the views are absolutely stunning on a sunny day, giving you a great panoramic view of Bangkok city's skyline and the greater plains in the background. Well worth the trek up if you're keen on great views."

The next thing I know I'm walking through an overexposed zodiac garden and a man in a yellow outfit beckons me to a staircase. I climb. The ascent is a lazy one bedecked with bells and fake rocks, gongs and statues of some foreign deity, the likes of which I've never seen before or since. The climb ends at the mouth of a great room, signs kindly remind you to keep your shoes on. The covered area is a welcome respite from the nuclear sun's penetrating rays, however brief it was. The climb continues to the roof: a decorated slab with a massive antenna painted gold. I can only imagine that this was some kind of ancient device used to communication with extraterrestrials that utilized some technology that we in the present day have long lost. It just makes you realize, as you look at the city below in all it's shades of brown, just how little goes into antenna aesthetics these days. They don't make 'um like they used to."

In May 2015, we decided to take the canal boat from Pratunam to the Golden Mount as it looked easy to get there looking at the map. A helpful local pointed us in the right direction and from there it was in fact easy to find. The walk from the boat pier was only about 5 or 10 minutes and a small entry fee gave us access to a moderate number of steps that wound around the hill and eventually up to the top. On the way up were a number of interesting stops with a variety of religious statues, gongs and relics to admire including the three wise monkeys!The top was accessible via a narrow staircase with a 360 degree walk around view of Bangkok and a refreshing breeze to help with the heat. We thoroughly enjoyed this trip that cost us less than a 100baht as the canal boat only cost us 9baht each way!! Who needs guided tours? Nearby are a number of government buildings, broad, clean streets (boulevards?) and impressive buildings.Well worth our morning out."

In the 19th Century, King Rama III tried to build a large chedi on the site to mark the entrance to the city. Unfortunately, the marshy soil in the locality could not support the large structure and it collapsed and became an overgrown pile of rubble. Later, Rama IV built a small chedi housing a Buddha relic on top. It was rebuilt again towards the end of the nineteenth century when an Indian viceroy (Lord Curzon), made a gift of a Buddha relic.There are about 300 very short but not too strenuous steps to climb to the top, where you have a 360 degree view of Bangkok. The building itself is large and rather plain and in the centre lies shrine which is encased in many layers of gold leaf. There are some amazing prayer bells around the perimeter. Be sure to ring them they sound amazing.Getting to the Golden Mount is a bit difficult because it is not near the Skytrain. This makes is a special place to visit because it is off the main tourist routes. As a result it is usually a very peaceful and tranquil place to visit. Try taking the Chaophraya Express Boat to the Memorial Bridge pier, and walk (about 1.5 k) or take tuk-tuk or taxi from there."

From the busy streets and all the hassle, everything transforms into tranquility. Stop at prayer bells, enjoy the quietness and continue all the way to the top. The temple is yet another small surprise with its several parts. Note that you leaves your shoes on. Climb up to the roof, enjoy gold temple and the 360 degrees view of Bangkok."

There are maybe 300 steps on the path which leads up to the temple, circling around the man-made artificial hill. It is a very good exercise, tiring a bit but the steps are not steep and there are places to stop and catch you breath on the way up. When we were there, we were the only foreigners and a few local people. When you are climbing up, you can enjoy the beautiful flowers and plants growing next to the paved way. I read that it is good to ring the bells and gongs for luck. The temple on the top doesn't have any extraordinary statues or decorations, it is a simple place to pray. The views of Bangkok from top are remarkable and beautiful.At the base of the mount, before we started to climb up, there were figures of animals as per the Chinese zodiac with some explanations but in Thai, as well as photos and notes (in English) about Buddhist sites in non-Buddhist countries (the figures of Buddha in Bamyan, Afghanistan, for example, which have been destroyed). Down at the base, if you pay attention, you will see something like a cemetery. Later I read that in the second half of the 18th century, that place had been used as a crematorium and dumping place for about 50 - 60 thousand people who had died of plague.On one side of the mount, there are, I think, living quarters of monks and we also wandered a little there.

Following the lead of many others we rang the bells lining the route and banged the enormous gong which makes a deep boom, great fun! Entering the base of the temple many people removed their shoes despite a recorded voice urging us not to. A short flight of spiral stairs takes you to the base of the golden dome which is visually overwhelming but due to its sheer size is very hard to photograph.

Just be sure you invest your time FIRST on the Bangkok Big 3: Temples of Emerald Buddha (Wat Phra Kaew), Reclining Buddha (Wat Pho) & Dawn (Wat Arun). The Bangkok Big 3 are all more spectacular than Golden Mount.Once you\u2019ve seen Big 3, by all means make your way to Golden Mount (Wat Saket) which offers a unique temple experience in Bangkok. What\u2019s unique: far fewer tourists; most visitors are devout local Buddhists; interesting nooks & crannies (especially at base), side temples, some of which are tiny but contain beautiful Buddha images; only \u201chill\u201d of consequence in Bangkok so views from up top are spectacular; surrounding neighbourhood is great to explore (see my Wat Saket review of 4 June 2013 for recommendations on touring the neighbourhood).Easiest way to get there is take Skytrain to National Stadium, then walk to & just past Jim Thompson\u2019s House until you hit canal (Khlong Saen Sap), turn right, walk along canal until you get to Hua Chang Pier. Take Khlong Saen Sap canal ferry WEST-bound to last stop (Phan Fa Lilat Pier). You\u2019ll see Wat Saket looming off to the left/south, at which point it\u2019s a 3 min walk. The Khlong Saen Sap canal ferry is best 30-cent \u201cadult Disney ride\u201d ever!"

When the boat roars up to the stop, you will need to hop on board, grabbing the rope for balance that hangs across the top. Then step down onto a bench. The ticket seller will come to you. When you get off, exit the klong station and turn left. There are signs to The Golden Mount, which is about a 5 minute walk away. There will be a ticket booth, 20 B, just before the steps. It is a long but gentle climb through a park like setting of flowering shrubs and greenery. Feel free to ring the many bells and hit the gong. At the top you will have a terrific view of the city. This Wat is quite different from others we have visited."

The whole activity was a great experience. Firstly, the officers at the entrance mistook as as regular tourist. They were surprise that Thai could look and act like tourist as well. On the way up and down, the major activity was ringing the bells and praying at various Buddha images. The whole visit lasted about an hour with great fun."

Boy oh boy, it was a flippin' hot, humid and sunny day to be walking around. But we took our time climbing to the top of the hill, and the final experience was lovely.The steps you climb as you circle the hill are quite small, so either you slowly climb up or start jumping 2 at a time! Then it levels out and you can hit a row of large bells (at least that's what others were doing). Then keep on going until you reach the actual temple! Once inside, I must have looked wiped out because the worker immediately led me to a large fan to cool off! So nice. There are places to pray here, but we are not buddhist, so we just took in the sites. You can then climb another tiny set of stairs to the roof, where the Golden Mount was decorated in cloth for the festival. The view from here was amazing! There is chanting playing over speakers, people worshipping by circling the mount and ringing a gong when done... and lovely breeze which is great on such a hot day! We stayed here for quite some time just taking it all in and appreciating the peacefulness of it all."

He also told us about the life of a Monk and when I was playing the gongs, he said it meant I was going to get good luck from the Heavens, which was nice.

There are quite a few wats in Bangkok whose art and architecture surpasses this; you could say that here the engineering is the most impressive element. However on a beautiful day, it's hard to find anything remotely as exhilarating as a walk up the Golden Mount. The mount is artificial; King Rama III ordered it built, but it was not competed until the reign of Rama V. You ascend sunwise (clockwise) from tropical foliage onto stairways that offer wonderful views of the surrounding temple complexes, until you arrive at the small shrine on top, Along the way both up and down you'll pass courtyards lined with sacred bells. (See photo) The sound of the bells is a nice addition to the overall ambience.Not an excessive walk from National Stadium skytrain sfation: just go straight west on Rama I past the elevated expressway, klong, and hospitals until you get to Thanon Warachak, turn left and after two short blocks, you'll see the entrance to the Golden Mount on the left. No admission fee, but you might care to leave a small donation at the shrine on the top.The view is particularly nice at dawn, and the walk is cooler in the early morning. Obviously you can view Bangkok from greater heights. SkyBar on top of the State Tower building comes immediately to mind, but while SkyBar's angle of view of the river and metropolis is loftier, the Golden Mount's view of the surrounding environs is more intimate and immediate. (See photo)Short-term note: at the moment there is a Kathina festival going on at the Golden Mount, adding traditional Thai music to the charms of the climb."

From the station we took a taxi and it took about 20 minutes for us to get there. Once we reached the temple we were amazed by the landscape around the area. The china town is visible from upon the temple rooftop. There is a calm tranquility in the temple. I felt almost lost in myself while I was looking at the city from above the temple.

The walk up to the top cuts through lots of lovely green surroundings with some really interesting shrines and little pools with frogs and turtles. Once you get to the prayer bells the white washed walls really put a strain on the eyes, especially if you dont have your sun glasses. The final slog upto the top definately builds up a sweat but the views are more than worth it. You can see the whole city and pick out all the landmarks. The golden stuppa its self is also amazing. The walk down is equally as sweat inducing but fortunately you can pick up a nice cold bottle of water from the store at the bottom and take 5 minutes on the picnic table. Well worth the many steps up, especially for the views."

You are rewarded with extensive views over Bangkok in all directions from the summit. A great place to spend some time taking photographs. Next door to the mount you will find Wat Saket. There's no fee and you simply wander through. There were no other tourists there and it felt like I had the entire place to myself, with the exception of some monks passing by.The interior of the temple is an absolute delight, beautifully painted.The lack of crowds and the peace and quiet made this a particularly memorable place to visit."

Despite it being on a hill or a mountain with so many stairs, it was so EASY a climb due to the \"low stairs\" (meaning each stair of a very short height) that you would just feel pretty much like walking on a horizontal surface! :)Great 360-degree views from the top with places to sit on one side (on the right), don't hurry coming back down and take in the views as much as you can. You can even see the tall prang (tower-like structure) of the famous Wat Arun from up here if you look carefully. And, in one scene I was kind of struck by how the newer tall skyscrapers of the city were sort of providing a backdrop in the distance to the older part of the city with rusty buildings right near this place.I was also pleasantly surprised to get some Thai tea for refreshment (for free!) after coming downhill, and at that base area there are also two temples or so (I believe they're called throne halls) and one of them has a standing Buddha in a blessing gesture.About a half-hour walk from the Hualamphong train station, the area around is a little complicated though, especially to find the entrance to buy the ticket and to go up, and you could also lose a sense of direction after coming down (since it's a round-shaped structure) and forget which street is in which direction, so the best thing to do to come here and to go back will be just to take a tuk-tuk!"

We've been to Bangkok before but this was our first visit to Wat Saket, the Golden Mount.Originally the highest point in Bangkok, this ancient monument has now been superseded by many of the tall skyscrapers, ....none however are within coooeee of this Wat, and so a pretty clear line of sight around the city.I'm not sure why anyone is commenting on steps. You'd have to be pretty unfit to notice them. I'm a 52 year old woman, very average health, and I don't remember being worried about the steps...or even noticing them.We visited with our two teen boys, who both enjoyed it as well. Starting off at the base, you findyour way up the entry...to the pathway that includes small grottos and waterfalls, orchids and delightful statues, cool and enticing with the sounds of running water and bells. There was also a Buddhist monk chanting out his words of ..prayer?, over a microphone, but it added to the atmosphere. A line of huge brass bells aches to be rung, 1 time each..along the line. The giant gong gets hit, gently, 3 times. Do it, it's fun. Don't forget to stop and take pictures of the gorgeous flowers.At the golden stupa it's so blindingly beautiful. Only the Thai's can do this and not be ostentatious. Inside you find your way to the top, and make sure you find the corner stairs where you can get to the roof to look out over the city. What a lovely view.Inside you'll see statues and icons and relics, and other religious artifacts. This is a working temple so be respectful. Ladies make sure your arms & legs are covered and don't wear anything too revealing or you won't be allowed in.Lovely, just a short visit of 1/2 was just right. Taxi back downstairs was waiting for us. So cheap, you can easily ask a taxi to wait, then you don't have to go to the trouble of finding another vehicle."

Well, this was told by our guide who we engaged to bring us around to see Religious Places for the day.As u enter the main hall after u have made it up, U will see candles and joss sticks at one side of the hall. There will also be a table, where a monk will be there to chant for u if u make a small donation. Just somewhere in between, u will see a small flight of stairs (about 5 to 8 steps). Walk up and u will see it. It is shape like a mini stupa. But u will not see the relics as they are inside the stupa.After that, u can proceed towards the top of the building to take more pics if u want. Or u can just enjoy the breeze at the top.The place is also not too crowded. If u have to do a small prayer there, please do it in front of the relics.As a mark of respect, certain religious places, I will not take any pics. This place is definitely one of those even though I really wanted to deep down inside me.Anyway, just be open minded and open hearted while u are there. Just enjoy the peacefulness and maybe on the way out, please make a small donation if u can."

It's difficult to know which ones to explore, because of the amount of options to choose from. The Golden Mount is definitely one to check out when in Bangkok. The hike to the top of the mount is somewhat arduous, but the reward of being able to look out onto the city from on top of the mount is well worth the workout. If you don't want to organize a tour to the mount, you can easily get here by taxi or tuk tuk."

Sticks up a reasonable height above the buildings so you can spot it. I believe the entrance fee was something like 50 THB and it might take a bit of walking around the mount to find the entrance. The walk up is cool it goes through various levels with ever increasingly better views of the city. Once you're at the top you ascend some very small and tight stairs to get to the very top. The view from up here is panoramic of the city and is definitely cool if you've got some time to explore Bangkok."

The Golden Mount is usually very quiet during the week but can turn chaotic on weekends or Buddhist holidays. It's lovely to walk up the winding stairs to the Golden Mount, perched on top of a small hill. Make sure you ring the bells along the way for good luck! The large gong halfway up is a popular photo op too. The top of the Golden Mount has a lovely view of the surrounding area but it can get blisteringly hot up there in the middle of the afternoon. The entry fee is 20 baht, which is great value for money considering the price of entry for nearby temples. Most taxi / tuk tuk drivers will know Golden Mount (Pu Kao Tong in Thai) or the adjoining Wat Saket. Highly recommended."

The climb is not at all steep and there are benches midway up to the top. Unless you are Buddhist, the only reason you can climb for is because of the fantastic 360 degree views that you get from the top. You can see a lot of Bangkok from the top. You can also climb to the roof of the temple through some narrow steps inside the temple. Unlike other temples, this one has shops selling cold drinks, souvenirs etc inside the temple. Inside a smaller chamber lies the Buddha statue and the area for worship. The hill lies in the middle of a bigger temple complex. On the ground level, there are quite a few small monasteries and halls. There is also a giant sitting Buddha statue. There are also quite a few bells and two giant gongs, you have to swing a big piece of log at them to make sound. On the way down you will come across a place where there are statues of a group of vultures eating a dead man - a Zoroastrian custom.There is no strict dress code for this temple, but of course dress sensibly, it is a religious place after all. The National Stadium BTS station is the nearest, you can take a cab or tuk tuk from there to reach this temple. It takes around 10-15 mins depending on traffic. You can see the whole complex in around an hour. If you are travelling with children, then most definitely go there, they would love it."

She explained all of the history and the meanings behind all of the statues etc. For example on the way in is all the animals that represent your birth year. I would have totally missed this if not for her. Same thing with the statues you see on the climb up and the Buddhas at the top that represent the day of the week you were born. We learned about which direction to walk and why and the meaning of the money/writing people were leaving. She also pointed out from the top everything we were looking down at. I don't know if there are guides you can hire there but if there are probably well worth it.I thought the whole site was very beautiful and it was extremely cheap to enter.

The view from the top was amazing and for 20 baht (~\u00a30.40) it was well worth it. The climb was easy enough for us 4 backpackers with bells along the way that you could ring. I wasn't sure of the significance of these, but I assume they were for the monks climbing up. We spent about 3/4 of an hour at the top just taking in the view and watching lightning hit the other side of the city. We went up this on our way to the other sites in the old city of Bangkok. Brilliant start to the day for us."

Some rather bizarre reviews below featuring mentions of paganism and the idea that it's free (it costs 20TB to get in the entrance I found, so unless they were sneaking past it there must be another way in!).Anyway, it's definitely a nice view from the top but unless you are quite young or spry it might test your legs a little bit. I felt a bit of a naughty boy ringing all the bells on the way up, but it seems all the tourists do that - there's a huge impulse in all human beings if they see a bell they have to ring it I guess."

The temple is located in Bangkok's 'old city' district where buildings are much shorter. Hence, climbing up to the top of Wat Saket presents you with a wonderful panoramic view of Bangkok which is totally distinct from the towering skyscrapers from the 'new city' district. Also, once on top, take time to take in the cool air and marvel at the golden stupa. You will find the peace and serenity that will soothe your tired limbs."

The temple is worth a quick visit but the real star is the manmade Golden Mount (\u0e3f20 per person), which we find to be a genuinely unique place to experience, particularly for first-time visitors to the city. Within Wat Saket temple, you will find typical buddha statues and other items of worship. In the Convocation Hall there are some nice wall murals as well (see pictures). Within the main temple building you can find a nice standing, dressed Buddha Statue is nice to see. Then it is time to move on the the main attraction, the Golden Mount. While the temple itself is nice to visit, it is the the Golden Mount that makes a visit here special. This is a giant, manmade hill, which was constructed during the reign of King Rama III. After paying your entry fee, you make a relatively comfortable, ascending walk up and around the Golden Mount in a clockwise direction. There are some Buddha statues, other figures and hanging bells that you can see as you walk up the hill. The walk takes around 8-10 minutes and there are a few benches you can use to take a rest if the heat or sun are causing you difficulty. The walk is quite manageable even during the midday heat, just take your time. At the top, there is an indoor worship hall and small gift shop, a nice stop if you want to buy drinks. There you will find a further set of indoor stairs leading you to a top of the hall. Here you find a flat surface, a golden chedi structure, additional Buddhist idols and some very nice 360 degree views of the city. It is enjoyable to hang out here and enjoy the views before returning back down the Golden Mount to visit the temple below or to move on to other attractions in the city. In the end, a visit to Wat Saket temple and Golden Mount can be done in 30-45 minutes. It is a nice attraction that we find well worth visiting during trips to Bangkok."

When at the top, a monk actually asked if there was anything I needed to know, and the whole place had a lovely tranquil feeling to it - no hurry, no rushing around. There are both toilets and street food very close by, so definitely worth an hours stop or so - wouldn't suggest you'd need any longer to admire this place but certainly wouldn't suggest missing it."

It actually has its origins from the Ayutthaya era, although it has been rebuilt since then. In November of each year, a Buddhist candlelight procession is held here, up the hill to the chedi. Entrance to Wat Saket compound is free, although nowadays they charge a small amount (10Baht or so) to see the chedi itself. I enjoyed visiting Wat Saket, but there is a real danger with the temples in Bangkok that you can get bored very easily. Wat Arun is your best bet, along with the Grand Palace."

Ring them!

On my website, you will find photos, videos, and detailed information that is continuously updated.Wat Saket is a must visit Buddhist Temple. It takes not more than 20-25 minutes for an average person to climb up the easy stairs with halts. Even if it gets a bit tiring on the way, you can go up and relax in the main temple's hall on the top where there are fans to cool you down. The temple is beautiful, and shoes are allowed in. You can click photos without hesitation, and watch all the Buddha's beautiful golden statues, and pick up some souvenirs if you wish to. Note that you 'may' (not 100% sure) get those souvenirs at Chatuchak Market too.Not too much to do up there, but if you enjoy sitting and relaxing doing nothing (like me), clicking photos from top, and just being at a nice location, you will surely enjoy the place.GETTING THERE: Khlong Saen Saep Express Canal Boat (link on my website) is the easiest way to go there. Just go to one of its stations, check on the map for Panfa Leelard, and take the boat going in that direction. It's as simple as that. The ticket I took was from my hotel (Bangkok City Inn, reviewed separately), the closest station was Pratunam. It costed me 12 Baht, and it was a fun ride. After you get down at the Panfa station, and come out, you will be greeted by Tuktuk drivers telling you lies that the temple is closed between 12 and 3 pm, and that they will show you other places meanwhile in 20 Baht. It's a lie. The temple is open from 7:30 am to 5:30 pm. I don't know what they are up to, but I've heard that they take you to some shops and kind of force you to buy some gold. If you firmly say a, \"No Thank You\" (like I did, and I was alone and easy for them to 'catch'), they leave you easily saying, \"Your wish\". Then walk over that beautiful white canal overbridge, and after about 100-200 meters of walk, you will be at The Golden Mount. Enjoy."

It is only a small temple at the top,but it has a gleaming gold Chedi, containing Buddha's relics. You can gain access to the roof which gives good views back over the city. The final little spiral staircase is behind a door, inside the building,in the corner and could be easily missed.There is an entrance fee of 20 baht to the Golden Mount. Next to The Golden Mount is The Shrine Hall which contains two of Thailands most revered Buddha images,one of which is a standing Buddha over 10m tall.The Hall is in a large tiled courtyard and well worth a visit before you leave the area.

This might be true when you have already seen other temples on a short period of time.Yet, the Golden Temple has its own charm. First, it is built on a man-made hill that provides a panoramic view over the city, provided it is a clear day. Several Thai Kings commissioned the construction. The golden stupa (known as 'chedi' rather than 'stupa' in Thailand) is at the top of the hill. Getting there is not really difficult as the stairs twist around part of the hill and are rather gentle. There are stairs to go up and others to go down. At the top platform, there is a magnificent 360\u00ba panorama over the whole city & you get a great view of the chedi. I would recommend to choose the end of the day as the sunlight provides a glow over the golden structure. But be careful because the downstairs cashier closes at 6:00PM (only 50B).The hill is in a well-tended garden and the adjoining monastery is worth visiting too."

Well, enough is said about this temple, it is simply one of the must-go places in Bangkok if you love history and culture, the problem is how to get there. The bad news is that there's no direct public transportation available to Wat Saket, you have to take taxi, problem is from where. If budget is your main concern, then the best way to go there is probably by boat + taxi, here's how:1. Take BTS train and get off at Saphan Taksin station2. Walk (about 1 min) to Central pier (or Sathorn pier) and take Chao Phraya Tourist Boat to No.9 Maharajl pier (the fare is 40 Baht)3. Get off at No.9 Maharajl, walk out the pier (you should now see the Grand Palace just few steps away) and take taxi from there, tell the driver to go to Wat Saket and remember to pay NO MORE THAN 80 Baht4. Return cost to No.9 Maharajl pier is around 60 Baht by tuk tuk car.I've seen some suggestions that one can as well take taxi from national stadium, but it will definitely cost more since it is far compared to from the pier and usually has more traffic jam."

Because of the loose soil it collapsed, leaving a huge mound of mud and bricks, which over time was covered in weeds and undergrowth. This provided a more stable foundation and later The Golden Mount temple was built on this artificial hill. There is a slow winding staircase up the mount, with bells along the way. Ring the bells as you go, its good luck and expected, even if you are a tourist. Atop there are terrific views across Bangkok, and many Buddha statues. You wont spend more than an hour or so there, but the view and walk up the staircase (not a tough walk at all) is definitely worth the excursion."

Whilst some other reviewers have also agreed it was free, when we went you were only allowed part way up and had to pay to access the very top which we didn't bother to do. I don't know whether they've recently started charging or whether it was because we went on a bank holiday (the King's birthday).The views were good from half way up but it was very crowded so we spent a lot of the time queuing.It's an ok visit for if you're in the area but unless you're willing to pay to go to the top I wouldn't go out of your way to visit it."

Also when you come back down they provide free drinks and food! it was a noodle and chicken soup which was really nice. Its a place to visit if you just have that little extra time..only need an hour or so here."

The mount is well landscaped and if you poke around and follow small trails, you may find old markers from past donors and honoured families. I found a German man's marker from another time...but watch for snakes. I saw the end of one and am happy he (or she, for that matter) didn't care to have a look at me.

Be sure to look in every nook and cranny you will undoubtable find something to take pictures of. When you reach the top there is a hall with Buddha images and a place to give offerings and then it is up the narrow staircase to the open roof. The views from here are spectacular and 360 degrees so you can like us try and figure out in which direction you live.

A fun way to get here is to take the water taxi along Khlong Saen Saep. We visited Jim Thompson's House first, then headed towards the canal. Turn right and walk along the canal to the water taxi stop. Be prepared to leap on as the boat whizzes up to the pier. Scramble into your seat, pay the conductor a few bahts and enjoy your mad, high-speed dash along the khlong. Stay on the boat until it stops at the Phan Fa pier. You'll see the Golden Mount from there."

            "review": "Among the Best of the Second-Tier attractions in Bangkok. The Golden Mount is the most striking feature of the otherwise mundane Wat Saket. Still, it is best experienced as part of a visit to the Wat itself, so that the Wat\u2019s history will strike you and so that the contrast between ordinary Wat and amazing Mount will strike you too. To do this to full effect, enter from Worachat Road, the street on the East side of the Wat. There, a few steps from the sidewalk, a small stone sign, dwarfed by adjacent vegetation, offers in Thai: \u201cWelcome to Wat Saket Ratcha Wora Maha Wihan.\u201d The sign is decidedly unassuming, as is the entirety of Wat Saket. Even with its marble fa\u00e7ade, the straight lines of the buildings and lack of unique features seem poised only to emphasize the majesty of the huge Golden Mount, to the north of the grounds. Together, the Wat and the Mount have a macabre, even Kharmic history that lend them enough supernatural weight that educated locals speak its short form rapidly, as if to avoid drawing attention to the name. More superstitious Bangkokians used a barely-whispered, \u201cSaket\u201d. From its founding in 1765, it was as sleepy as its current architecture depicts. All that changed when the Chinese brought Black Plague to all of Asia\u2019s port cities, including Bangkok, between 1790 and 1794. Since by Royal edict, cremations could not take place within the city walls, Saket\u2019s location immediately outside the walls of Rattanakosin Island, and its commodious crematorium made it a natural as the center for the cremation of plague victims. Historians claim the smoke from Saket and the smell of burning human flesh dominated the city for months, as more than thirty-thousand plague victims had flesh reduced to ash. A second wave of plague from Chinese merchant ships added another thirty thousand Bangkok-area victims a year later. Stroll in slowly, and look around, as you will have no alternative but to pass through the stone-floored courtyards covering mass bone crypts (Buddhist cremation is low-temperature, leaving bones behind), and along the length of the burial walls built from the very bones of cremated plague victims, most unidentified. The vegetation has done its best to soften these marks of devastating human tragedy, but the almost overgrown feel only drapes a palpable pall about the place. It has a history of construction mishaps and mystery as long as your arm, and but for Allied intervention, might well have been destroyed in a planned bombing by the Japanese in World War II. You will feel every bit of its history coming in this way. The squeamish and those looking for no drama might best enter from the West. Walk through the grounds and reach the bottom of the mount, and you will find a coiled snake wrapped around the hill in the form of a long stairway leading to the top. The hundreds of stairs are painted red with non-slip paint, and feature risers roughly nine inches high but with three-foot treads. It is difficult to get a steady rhythm on stairs whose queer geometry seems designed to match no human stride, but perhaps this only emphasizes the dozen or more built in excuses to linger on the way to the top. You will find alcoves with small benches, the meditative melodies of a small well landscaped waterfall, misters, and a wide platform with temple bells to ring. As you rise, the views of the city became more impressive. The Golden Mount\u2019s 89 meter height made it Bangkok\u2019s tallest structure from its inception until the late 1970s, and even half way up, the view is impressive.The top tier of the Golden Mount well-deserves its name. As you reach the tiled cement platform at the top of the stairs, should you do so between say 10:00am and 3:00pm, you are likely to feel a palpable increase in temperature, the result of the sun\u2019s blinding reflection from the thirty foot gold-leafed Chedi sitting atop its even larger box-shaped plastered pediment. From here, the city views do not disappoint. Walking inside the pediment reveals a more or less windowed structure with exhibits and the occasional Monk holding forth. And of course, in the center of the pediment structure is housed an argon-filed steel box holding bits of the hair, scalp and clothing of The Buddha, brought from the ruins of a Himalayan monastery on the India-Nepali border in 1899. This is a place of deep significance to Buddhists, who often use the trip up as a kind of purification rite. Prior to about 2002, the entrance into the chedi base above was a small wooden ladder, though lately it has become a tightly-spiraling staircase. This takes you up the last fifteen feet to the gold of the chedi itself. This is not for the disabled!From the very top, the breeze and views are wonderful, even on a hazy day, and there are few places better suited to watching the Cumulo-Nimbus clouds of the rainy season build and drop their watery burdens. I love the view from here, and suggest most of you will too. It is worth the moderate exercise and the heat to take in this place fully! "

            "review": "Some tips on what to expect and how to stay cool on the way there.. Start from Fort Mahakan (see route by water bus later in this report) and you should be there in under 10 minutes. As you know the heat and humidity means travel is sweaty so here is one route to keep the travel to a minimum. You read it here first! You will see the white painted stucco temple from the bridge at fort Mahakan. Take the small bridge towards the Temple of the Golden Mount. Look out for the wide open gates on the left. and cirulate antiiclockwise. Once through the gates you circulate anticlockwise until you get to the stairs up. Entry 20 Baht per adult. The first delight is small steps for 'little people' all the way to the top.On the way up there are little water falls and vapourised water spraying out, with the intent to refresh you whilst climbing. Eventually you come to a higher intermediate level. I noticed children and teenagers going to ring the prayer bells, bong, bong bong. Everyone including the women enjoy this experience but respect the buddhists who come here to ring a bell and expects God to hear their prayers and send out good reverberations into society around. You know Catholics have special moments like this when the Host is held aloft and the communion bell is rung. They believe that the host is turning into the body and blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. A very special moment when you are all down on your knees. Now back to the climb, I did this climb at 11 am and do not do this one in the afternoon when the heat will get you in summer time. The elderly and children over 5 will manage this climb in say 15 minutes easily .... just stop and rest when you need to. No pressure.As you near the top the photo spots get better but wait until the top. By know you are climbing around a white painted (plastered?) conical mount. At the top you go inside and there are fans blowing. Lovely cooling air. You can buy drinks, souvenirs and incense sticks and kneel at the shrines. There are seats, not a lot of them, and open windows, shuttered if their is a downpout and in May - August they frequently occur but never last too long. At this level there is one part in the centre of the building which you take your shoes off to visit. It is the point of the Shrine, which is to venerate the relics of what they call the Lord Buddha. He may be a lord but there is only One Lord of Lords.Now for a few of you the climb stops here but let me encourage you to go one level higher. In the right hand corner of the buidling (think about where you entered is a very short but very steep set of steps. Very short but mind your head as the climb is so steep you will be looking a the steps, holding the handrail and not thinking about bumping your head. The Thai branch of Buddhism has a lovely idea for making the steps so steep. The principal is that one should be on your hands and knees in the presence of God. Kneeling in western culture is the same. We are showing humility to an all powerful (El Shaddai) God who neverless has our good at heart.OK you reached the top in under 1 minute and now you are out on a top 4 sided balcony with a Stupa (conical) at the centre.Enjoy the views, then sit down and relax and study the worshippers here. I notices as many young as old people here and yes us westerners brought our children here. Very good to have them in church. Be discreet as you watch the buddhists kneel and prostrate themsleves all to the audio (hifi) chanting of monks piped over a loudspeaker system. move around and sit down again and see the alms given to God, ....paper money offerering tied to 'clothes lines'. Watch worshippers go to the side shrines in the corners and kneel and speak to their God. Remember Buddha was an enlightened one and never claimed to be God but only to point the way.The last treat at this level. There are two giant gongs. (Remember the rank adverts at the start of a film in cinemas?) Well everyone can take a turn at using the clothed hammer to strike the gong.This level is a hive of activity at most times of the day but you leave with a sense of wonder and supernatural peace.Now the way out is again a short but very steep stairway down in the opposite corner to that which you used on the way up. Back into the shopping/Buddha relics area. Do not forget to refresh yourself with a drink or icecream if the heat has gotten to you.A very important point. I did not use toilets at this level so I do not know if they are their but I know they are at the bottom so use them on the way up and way down.Once outside again little steps and prayer bells every know and again. Bong.Bong. Bong.Be comforted as God knows your every thought and He does hear and care.Some great photos of climbing plants which cover the trees can be seen on the way down. I saw a broad leaf (light green) and a flower that looked like a purple convovulus.... very pretty. Near the bottom you come to a narrow set of steps but a good handrail so they are not difficult.At the bottom a small shrine where you can go in and pray, offer incense.Beware you think you have come back to the entrance but not so. I followed the crowd but went onto the wrong exit. Never mind as it added to the adventure but took me nearly 20 minutes to get back to the water taxi and fort Makahan. The solution is when at the shopping level look out if all the windows and study the road layout beneath you.Enjoy and may you know Our Lord's blessing on your life. This attraction was the highlight of the day Oh by the way once back to fort Mahakan (under 10 minutes) you will walk as quickly as a taxi. The Tuk Tuks also get stuck in frightful traffic congestion so if you are going to come by road then get a motor cycle taxi. Do your research first though, agree the price at the start and this method is not recommende for women on their own.There are a number of other attractions nearby all within walking distance but allow 4 hours and dress in shorts and a tee shirt, all of which attire was accepted at the Temple of the Golden Mount.This is definitely not for someone in a wheel chair. Sorry.Now this attraction is nowhere accessible by car or train so a further recommendation on how to get to The temple as follows. You will need a map to make sense of the next part but bear in mind, 10 minutes walk up Ratchadamnoen Nok Avenue going north will bring you to the Ministry of Tourism and there are lots of maps and books for free there.You will need to decide from there do you go north to The Boxing Stadium, Marble Temple and Vimanmek Palace and throne hall or retrace your steps to fort Mahakan as that is the easiest way back to the BTS. BTS is very efficient and has topclass airconditioning once you are one the train.A suggested rout to The temple of the Golden Mount.Train it to BTS Ratchathewi (Bearing line) then walk back towards the canal bridge (low level). Say 200 metres south to the southwest side of the canal bridge over Khlong Saen Sab. Once down the steps you are under the 'belly' of the bridge and there is a tiny market or set of stalls, walk west away from the bridge just a few yards into the stalls and you will see the opening to the jetty (landing station for the the water bus). The water bus comes along say every 10 minutes in daylight but I am told stops by 7pm. You will take the water bus going west and you pay 10 baht per head. Be positive do not ask questions just proffer the correct money when the bus conductor walks along the side of the boat to you. It is an easy journey and you go all the way to the little termini. It is obvious as everyone gets off. Some good photos and excitement if you have video. Noise water gushing against the prow. I tell you when two water taxis pass each other the boat rocks for a few minutes afterwards. As the boat picks up speed some side curtains lift up to protect you from spray but you will want to hold them down if you want the photographs.Whilst at speed on the canals (khlongs) there is a pleasantly refreshing breeze.Get to know how to recognise the landing stage for the BTS before you take the water bus. It is easy you are going to look for a high level concrete bridge up above you. You could also count the road bridges. Be ready to get on and off as the water bus does not delay for anyone.Now look out for a small 'running board' on the inside of the bulwark as it helps lower your step down onboard and once on board you can stand alongside the housing (covering for the engine) so you get the best shots. Best not to cramp your style by sitting in the middle of a seating row.By the way the end of the line is Fort Mahakan.Be blessed and remember the bells, the bells and know they toll for you.Chris"

            "review": "Visit if in Bangkok for 5+ days-Great View/Workout. The Golden Mount is a worth a visit if you're in Bangkok for 5 or more days. But if your time is precious, save your efforts for things like the Bangkok \"Top 3\" - Temple of Emerald Buddha (Wat Phra Kaew), Temple of Reclining Buddha (Wat Po), Temple of Dawn (Wat Arun). Golden Mount as a sight/site pales in comparison to those Bangkok \"Biggies\".PLUSES: The climb is a gentle ramp that curves around the mount, taking you through a verdant micro-jungle at the bottom, past a series of massive bells which you're welcome to ring, adding to the atmosphere. The whole climb is a great workout! The golden stupa atop the mount is an amazing, almost blinding sight up close in the daylight. Best to sit quietly for awhile and watch the many local Thais (who very much outnumber tourists) make their pilgrimage as they walk clockwise around the stupa as they pray. The view of Bangkok from the top is stupendous. Overall, a very atmospheric, genuine encounter as you share with the Thais their spiritual experience.MINUSES: though it's a gentle upward grade, there are still lots of steps, so guaranteed you will be sweatin' like a sow by the time you get to the top! There are no particularly interesting sights INSIDE any of the buildings (no amazing Buddha statues).TIPS: If you've already made your way to the Golden Mount, explore the main street running north-south beside the entrance (Boriphat Road) where you will see more than a dozen open-air woodworking shops. Amazing craftsmanship, often executed by tradespeople right before your eyes! Alluring wood aroma all around. Also, if you walk south on Boriphat Road to first main interesection, turn right (west) on Thanon Bamrung Mueang and cross the canal, on the south side you'll see more than a dozen \"Buddha\" shops, selling every conceivable kind of Buddha statue in every size known to man. Very atmospheric, totally NON touristy (this is where Thais come for their religious icon purchases). Loved it.Due to the very interesting neighbourhood around Golden Mount, I rate this attraction 4-stars (Very Good). If not for the cool 'hood, would only rate Golden Mount 3-stars (Average)."

Especially during the week and of course outside public holidays the Golden Mount provides a great experience. There wont be many people and those who made it here have really a kind of interest beyond making pictures only. The pure amount of steps you have to manage to come to the temple itself provides a first kind of quality gate if you really want to go here. No shops or sth comparable other than one at the top destroy the authentic atmosphere. You have an amazing view over Bangkok form the top. Not only the skyline and the kings palace but especially the view over the local places close by is sth unique. Once at the top you can buy (one shop must be there...) a kind of bell where you can write your wishes and place it at the very top at the golden mountain itself. A very nice thing to do while enjoying the place. The Golden Mountain might be a good stop between City and Kings Palace. Hardcore travelers might even want to walk from here to Kings Palace but thats quite a walk. Enjoy."

Wat Saket always appears in the guidebooks as a highly rated \"thing to do\" but hardly any tourists seem to go there because its a bit out of the way. It's really worth a visit. If you happen to be staying in Sukhumvit, a fun way to get there is on the public transport klong boats on the Saen Saeb canal. It costs about 16 baht from the wharfs at soi 3 (Nana) or soi 21 (Asoke) to Wat Saket, which is the end of the line, noting however that you have to change boats at Tha Pratunam. To get to Wat Saket from the intersection you walk a few hundred metres down Thanon Mahachai, which is devoted to cabinetmaking and lumber shops, which are interesting in themselves. Wat Saket is quite a climb, but it is worth it. You get a great 360 degree view of Bangkok from the top. The Wat is the centre of the Loi Krathong celebrations which take place in November."

There's a saying 'Before the reward there must be labor'. When I arrived there, I was so excited to see the temple up there that I quickly dismissed the idea of being lazy and I know the reward would be worth every climb. When I saw the stairs, I thought \"Well, it's not bad at all!\" The stairs were flat and not steep like in Wat Arun. And there's place to rest too. While you're climbing, you can go slow and enjoy the view as you go along.There are bells and gongs halfway through the stairs. Make sure you hit them. It's fun!The reward was of course...the view of Bangkok...BEAUTIFUL!!!The Buddha inside is beautiful. There are shops selling Buddhism books, accessories etc. And you can go upstairs to the rooftop where you can view an even better 360 degrees view of Bangkok. Make sure you visit this temple!

There are stairs that go around the mount, when you first start your journey you go through beautiful foliage making it feel like you are in a rainforest. As you get near the top and are peering around the stairs light will shine in your eyes making you feel like you are walking \"towards the light.\" Once you get to the top there are some Buddhas and a little gift store in the temple area and then you take a very narrow staircase to the Golden Mount. The view of Bangkok is great and the Golden Pagoda is huge. It is a great place to stop for about an hour."

The views from the top are nice and you can see much of the city from up above. The temple itself and the drums and gongs are also interesting and if you're lucky you'll see some monks beating away on one of the drums. This wat is also close to other attractions within walking distance. There's a klong nearby where you can jump in a boat and see something that way, there are other temples within 10 minutes walk, and Democracy Monument is about 15 minutes away.

The mountain is open until 17:30 and they really start to kick people out closer to 6 p.m. This is a bit before the sunset but still gives you a lot of time to enjoy the setting sun and the views of colorful city.Above all I loved the tranquility, not many people were there surprisingly and one could fully relax, enjoy the views, meditate, walk around the Stupa on the top, breath in \"fresh\" air :).There is a cafe, toilets and souvenir shops on the way up - if anyone's interested. Otherwise, the area itself is nicely done - some small waterfalls, Buddha statues, bells which everyone likes to ring ... is it for good luck? :)I think it is a very special place to visit in Bangkok and the best is to come before sunset and count on 1-2 hours for the visit."

Golden Mount is a Buddhist temple and dates back to the Ayutthaya era, it is situated on a low hill crowned with a golden Chedi on the top.There are 318 steps to climb to reach the top, so going early is advisable. There are many thing to look at on route including Buddhist statues and bells. Entrance is free, but 5 Bart to enter the Chedi. And the opening times to the Golden Mount are from 9.00am-17.00pm.Once at the top the golden Chedi is quite spectacular and surprisingly peaceful, there are excellent views of Bangkok, as this once used to be the highest part of the city.Be aware though if you go in November this may coincide with Temple Fair (Loy Kratong) a ten day long festival which is a sacred pilgrimage to the Golden Mount and is incredibly busy.Golden Mount should be for any traveller who is looking for something new and a little off the tourist trail to explore."

Wat Phu Khao Tong, AKA the Temple of the Golden Mount, is the temple with the golden chedi that sits high (for Bangkok) above the city skyline. It is an excellent wat to visit and the view alone is worth climbing the ramp/steps to see. However, this review is more about Wat Saket which is the temple below WPKT. Wat Saket is an interesting temple in its own right and is far less frequented that WPKT-which makes it worht visiting for the peace and tranquility alone. Why go? Well, for the following reasons: the giant standing Buddha in the 'no fighting' pose is a beautiful sight and the building next door is a royally accredited ordination hall for monks (often open only to men as designated by the small statues ringing the temple showing where it is appropriate for men and women to be - but only on official occasions it would seem as my wife entered the temple without fuss). If you are into temples and their various roles within the country you're visiting then these two temples provide a nice contrast."

The city noise seems to hush right up when you are climbing, and it left me feeling very relaxed.

Bangkok's conventional public transport systems, namely the skytrain or MRT, don't go anywhere near it. Most consign themselves to the drudgery of a long, hot taxi ride. However, there is a another less conventional way of getting there that the locals use everyday; the water taxis. Take the MRT to Petchaburi station. Get off and take exit number 2 and it's then a short walk to Klong Saen Saep jetty to catch a water taxi. The twenty minute ride involves a change of boats, at the mid point of the trip, but for fourteen Baht, full fare, it's a trouble free ride down the klong as you avoid the chaos, and traffic congestion, of Bangkoks roads. You alight at a jetty, from which you can actually see the Temple of the Golden Mount, and it's then an easy 5 minute walk to the entry gate. If you're feeling hungry, after the climb up to the Golden spire, you might want to try the Sorn Daeng restaurant down at Democracy Monument. It's one of Bangkok's best kept secrets when it comes to reasonably priced, but excellent, Thai cuisine. Get a map and It's an easy 10 - 15 minute walk from Wat Saket. Bon appetite."

However, you will have to climb up a bunch of stairs that wrap around this mini man-made mountain. There is no entrance fee as long as you don't climb up the final bit of stairs to the top viewing terrace, but, seeing as you climbed so far, you may as well just go to the top for such a small entrance fee. Once when I went there, there was nobody to take my money to climb onto the top part of the temple. I like this place because you there are not a lot of tourists. From this temple, you can go see Khoa Sarn Road or take a klong (canal) boat to Central World Plaza or another location in Bangkok. Just head out of the temple through a small gate that leads out onto a small road that is lined with shops selling wood, go over a small bridge (you will see the canal), and then go around to where you can see long boats parked. Pay your money and get ready for a stinky yet amazing ride. Keep asking the people around you where your desired location is and they will tell you. On the whole, I find the Thai people are very friendly and helpful to tourists who go off the beaten path. If you are heading to Central World Plaza, a reasonable walk to Pratunam clothes market (north) or to the BTS skytrain (south), the stop will be obvious because passengers will have to change to a larger boat to continue down the Klong (canal). The canal will take you all the way past the Mall Bangkapi to Happy Land. However, I suggest you do not go any farther than the Mall Bangkapi, a decent sized mall with nice places to eat and shop. There are even theatres and a small water park on the roof."

To say the Golden mount is bright is an understatement you can't miss it if you are within 1km range of it. The neighborhood is equally interesting with many different craft streets. These are sois dedicated to various industries like door manufacturing and coffin making. If you are smart enough with a map poke around in the back alleys and get yourself a traditional prayer bowl.

It is one of my top 4 places to take visitors, along with Jim Thompson House (or the home of MR Kukrit Pramoj), a park (the exact park to be worked out with the visitor and depending on the time of the year) between 6 and 8 PM, and a ride on the Chao Phraya Express Boat (to somewhere that we agree on, usually including a stop at Thewet Pier to feed the fish). For the Grand Palace, etc. I put them on a tour bus and stay away (been there decades ago, done that). But for these four places I come back with them - partly selfishly for my own sake.Perhaps the stellar attraction for foreign visitors to Wat Saket is Golden Mount:http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293916-d456261-Reviews-The_Golden_Mount_Wat_Saket-Bangkok.htmlcurrently rated #15 of 217 attractions in Bangkok. But a meander through Wat Saket itself is an opportunity to meditate. And a meander through the surrounding neighbourhood is also an opportunity to appreciate a neighbourhood. The surrounding neighbourhood is historic, but the modern-day activities (including many wood product shops) are worth wandering around (maybe with your camera).When you visit Bangkok, ask a Bangkok resident to tell you about the importance of Wat Saket, beyond the significance of the Golden Mount. It will give you insights into how a temple may be appreciated by people in Thailand, in addition to an understanding of the temple itself - as a center for learning and more.Here are a couple of videos of the temple:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHGAP-H8ITkhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kfpvadw7vsoPlease note that this is not on the main tourist route, so (at least at present) does not push a commercial admission charge on visitors. Hopefully, this will give the visitor an opportunity to be more reflective, and less touristy, than at places like the Grand Palace."

The experience generally consists of making a slow winding climb around the outside of the temple, past all these big bells and a couple of small sitting areas until you get to this indoor area which resembles an observation deck, complete with gift shop. Here benches surround open air windows, monks sit and chat or bless worshippers and tourists generally roam around gawking. Off in one small corner is a set of stairs which go up to an outdoor platform which circles the top of the Wat. Here are the best views of the city (if its not too hazy to see) so you'll probably want your camera. Not much else up there other than a set of those metal binoculars you put 10 baht into to have a up-close view of basically nothing. After your you may want to visit another nice Wat in the area. I believe its called Loha Phasit, its on the other side of the canal. Completely different and, somewhat unique architecture. The temple offers some interesting history and another slightly different great view.All in Wat Saket is well worth the visit but be sure to take the time to explore the area. Tip: There is a river bus below Wat Saket which will take you to either Chao Pharya River or north of the Siam Shopping area. Its tucked just under the bridge at the canal which separated Wat Saket from the main road. If you're looking for an inexpensive diversion, jump on and explore Bangkok from a different perspective!Cheers and happy travels!"

About half way up there's a rest station with coffee and toilets. When you get to the top there are several small shrines and figures, and the mountain itself of course, faced with tiny golden tiles. Most impressive. we spent an hour there, entranced."

The temple grounds of Wat Saket are not spectacular, but are very pleasant and more conducive to meditation than the touted tourist-packed temples. Golden Mount itself is an interesting, relatively young, archaeological site - you can see ruins of older structures scattered about the \"mount\" as you climb up to, and down from, the Chedi at the top. The views from the elevated platform surrounding the Chedi, and the meditative atmosphere, make this one of the more popular places that I take visitors to. The surrounding neighbourhood, filled with wood-working shops, is also interesting. The lack of scammers lurking around the entrances is also a relief (but common when you get away from the tourist-packed areas of Thailand)."
