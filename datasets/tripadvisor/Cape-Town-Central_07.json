It was a very good idea since all the occupants got the opportunities to see the views as we traveled up. The scenery was breathtaking. It was a very smooth sensation all the way up. Being on the summit was fantastic with panoramic views all around. Also a very nice restaurant serving food and refreshments. All in all a great day out."

I would like to thank the staff at the cable way who went out of their way to help, I was there with my sister and her partner, who is paralyzed and in a wheelchair - from when we were looking for parking already there was someone helping and directing us. I was so proud of everyone that works there and super proud to be South African as my sisters partner is from the UK and couldn't believe how helpful and wonderful everyone is here in our gorgeous SA. Once again thank you.Kind RegardsKaren"

We still had to queue for nearly an hour before reaching the top of the mountain, however this was still quicker than buying tickets on the day, as after spending an hour and half on the top, we met people in the non ticket queue just arriving at the top.Be prepared to walk to the cable car station, as parking is limited at the station area. We parked further down the hill and had a 10min uphill walk.The cable car is modern and spins 360 as you go up, which is a full turn giving everybody a view at the open window at the front and rear of the cable car. We stood by the opposite door, by the time we had spun to the open window it was perfect for photos.Once at the top you can walk around a smooth footpath, with various places to go off the path and walk over rockier parts to get better views/photos.There are toilets, cafe and a gift shop.Despite queuing with hundreds of visitors, once your at the top it feels spacious and less busy. The views are amazing and well worth a visit. We lucked out with the weather , the cloud lifted and showed Cape Town in all its finest.Would defiantly recommend"

We asked the bus driver and he recommended going between 3 -4pm. We went back on the Sunday at 3 pm - no queue at all. Walked straight onto the cable car. It is really great because it rotates 360deg as it ascends so everyone gets to see the views across the bay. Great views from the top of Table Mountain in all directions and paths laid out to do different walks."

If you are in the cable car, the thing you are standing on is going around. So everyone get's a great view and the change to make pictures. They can take a lot of people @ the time and it goes pretty fast. Great way to see the view of the city and the mountain if you have problems with walking."

My father's birthday fell on a Saturday and he was able to get a free cableway ticket on that day as a result so I decided to take him as a birthday treat. My mother is a pensioner and she could get pensioner's discount but only on a Friday. I contacted the company and they not only allowed him to use his birthday comp a day early but also fully comped my mother's ticket. I was amazed at the effort they made. I paid full price for my ticket.On the day my mother was too ill to join us but we decided to go anyway. When we arrived there were no more wheelchair parking places available but a member of staff moved some barriers to make a space for us. We were greeted with smiles and helpfulness every step of the way. When my ticket wouldn't scan they simply let me use my mother's rather than spoil the outing. Despite the wheelchair, we were able to navigate everywhere he was curious to explore. We enjoyed a wonderful, hearty, affordable, tasty and nutritious lunch with the most helpful and cheerful of service all the way. Ten out of ten!On our return to the lower station we were assisted through the waiting crowds and to the lift.I wanted to write this review because I couldn't fault the service at any stage. They even refunded my unused ticket in full! I am involved in the tourism industry and can honestly say that I am proud of the international standards that have been set and put into action at one of our international icons!"

We had about a 1hr wait at the bottom which is to be expected. There are great walkways up top. However when we finished the walks and decided to go get a drink and ice cream to watch the sunset, we were surprised to find no shops open- they all closed at 4pm!! You could aonly buy water and coffee from the coffee store.Then the real frustration began- getting back down! Last cable car is supposed to leave at 7pm. We lined up at 6:15pm and did not get down to the bottom until 8:45pm! Tour groups kept getting priority which meant we kept getting pushed further back. Didn't make for a nice end to the table mountain experience"

Table Mountain is God's wander and you've got to be there to understand. it is better to plan ahead and give yourself at least a day on Table mountain to enjoy the magnificent view, flora. you can also just enjoy lazying around on the flat top in between the rocks. there are always friendly staff to assist just in case you end up on the wrong side of the mountain on your way back. The weather in Cape Town can change quickly most of the times from foggy to clear, cold to warm, so with enough time up there you may still catch good views in between weather changes. One thing for sure, Cape Town never disappoints!!"

Despite industrial action taking place, the members who were working made sure everything ran as smoothly as possible. The queue was a little slower but the staff polite and apologetic, and got as many people through as humanly possible in the shortest space of time. At all times keeping their cool, and being extremely friendly. In fairness to the strikers, they did not interfere with the tourists and at no time did we feel threatened. Although the mountain has hike routes and you can also ride up walk down,for us the cable car is was must to get to the top. It turns very slowly giving a good 360 view, and it feels as if it is over far to fast. This is a national park, not a fake Disneyland, so the top involves lots of walking on well planed routes, wooden bridges and walkways,, that have minimal impact to the natural environment. This is not the EU, there are barriers at points but the natural feel and surround has not been marred by man made blockades to stop people going to the edge or climbing over rocks. . Watch your children. Teach them to respect the natural flora and fauna. On a clear day the view is amazing, the air early morning crystal clear, the walk exhilarating. Poor weather could prevent the car going up so always check. Low cloud or a table cloth could change your experience,so try to have a few days ear marked and go the first time you see the mountain clear. There is a web link and fb page to check. The cable car ride is around 5 minutes either way,the time needed at the top is up to you but, don't rush, budget at least half the day sit back relax and enjoy the view. This truly deserves the title of one of the new natural wonders of the world."

At about 1000m, your viewpoint is high above, yet close to the city below. Take a jersey in summer or a coat in winter. Especially when the wind is blowing it can get really cold up there. When the wind is extreme the cable car shuts down, but they give you plenty of warning before the last ride down. There is also a restaurant up there as well as places to buy cold rink and snacks. I last went to the restaurant many years ago and it was awful. Find out when sunset is, and the time of the last ride down, during your visit and see if you can time your visit to ride up just before sunset, watch the sunset from up there, view the city lights after dark, and then come down"

While some people are fit enough (and have the time) to walk up, for most taking the cable car up is the best and easiest way. It's become super popular, so you will have to queue, but it is worth it. Some tips:- Do purchase your tickets online, and come in the afternoon or *very first thing* in the morning if your schedule allows. Of necessity, we arrived at 9:30am and the wait was over an hour (10 mins on the way down)- Take the time to really walk around up on the mountain. Yes it's nice to see the view and take a photo near the upper station, maybe grab a coffee, but the really special thing to do is to go on one of the hikes up on the mountain, anything from 20 mins to 2 hours. You'll get away from the crowds quite quickly.- Be prepared (dress/weather). It's written all over the place, but still many people came in flip flops and t-shirts and then were freezing up at the top. Recognize weather up there may be different than down below, and may change in flash. Be prepared.- Watch out for poor queuing behaviour. A bunch of locals(?) tried to cut in front in line and we had to send them packing -- after at least a dozen people pretended to not notice or otherwise wanted to not be confrontational- Uber it. Parking near the lower station is very limited. An uber cost <$5 each way to downtown Cape Town. We left our car in the hotel and were happy for it."

Especially for the cableway, it is very important to chose to visit on a day that is not too windy (and of course you don't want a really cloudy day because you want see anything at the top) because the cableway cannot run if the wind is too strong. I would also advise buying you tickets ahead. When you arrive, there will be two lines - one for people with online tickets (you can also get these on the Hop-on - Hop-off bus) and one for people with no tickets.

Do check online prior to going as the Aerial Cableway is closed during bad weather.2. You can buy tickets online prior to going (or when you're there) and join a shorter queue.3. If you drive there, there are parking attendants that would direct you to park at their lots. If you park too early, you'll have a long walk. One tip is to get to the Cableway station to drop off passengers and then turn back down and park at the nearest available lots."

We went in the morning before the crowds plus our guide handled the details of getting us on the car. The view is breathtaking and the area rather expansive, so you could easily spend an hour or more hiking the plateau, but on a tour this isn't possible. So it's a toss up. With a guide it is a quicker transition from ground level to top, plus someone local is giving you a commentary of what you are seeing, but your time is brief. Whichever way you choose just do it, it's a must see."

Otherwise get your walking boots on and ready for a lot of steps!Expect the queues to be busy as naturally there are lots of tourists that want to head to the top of Table Mountain. The cars fit 65 people and there are two; one goes to the top as the other returns to base. It takes around 5 minutes and the car has a revolving floor so you get a full 360 view and there's no need to shuffle around. Also, be aware that if the weather is bad or visibility is poor the cars may not be in operation so if you are in Cape Town for a few days plan your trip early so that if the weather turns you are not disappointed!"

It's school holidays and the weather was mother top notch Cape Town day.Be sure to buy your cable car ticket before you arrive. We suggest buying this at the Red Bus ticket office at 81 Long Street. They open from 8.30am day.The best way is to get there via the red bus.Our wait was 1.5 hours in the end. There are two queues for those that had tickets and those without and the one with tickets was slightly faster. All in all the wait didn't seem to bad.When you arrive at the too of the stairway to take the cable car you are split into groups of about 65 people. The cable car rotates so be sure to be by the window if you want to get a 360 degree view.The ascent is about 5 minutes. It exhilarating, beautiful and a nice ride.Once you get to the top it's amazing. Excellent vistas and well worth the wait.

The pictures are available for purchase when you come back down. The pictures were very good except we had on olive drab hats and our heads were cut off!"

Always take a wind proof jacket as it gets cold and windy on the mountain and the wait to come down again could see you standing outside in the queue for a very long time while you wait. Car parking is a major issue that should receive urgent attention, as it the absence of a safe pedestrian walkway if you have to park a distance along the road. Pedestrians have no option but to walk in the road, where normal road traffic has to pass. Very dangerous and unnecessary. All personnel were extremely friendly and welcoming and it's obvious that some investment is being made in training them well. Good job to all!"

You can book tickets online or via your tour operator. The cable car has a rotating base which affords you a 360 degree view of Cape Town as you get to the top. Of course, keep an eye out for bad weather as the cableway will not operate if it is too windy, misty or rainy."

In their summer (Oct -March) I can see it getting very very busy & hence horrendous queues.... The earlier in the day you can go the better.You have to go as soon as you get a good day. If it's windy they shut the cable car & you may have to walk up. It's a very long steep walk.Once you get to the top the views are fantastic.There are ramps for wheelchairs & we took my mums with no problems. There's a couple of shops & also a cafe/restaurant at the top as well as loo's. We got there on the open top city tour bus with no problems. It's well worth including this in your itinerary of things to do in Cape Town."

You either queue in the fast lane if you have prebooked your tickets online (recommended) or in the slow lane to buy tickets first before proceeding to the cableway. Waiting times depend on day of the week and weather conditions. Children until 4 years ride for free. Once at the top, you can walk around, there is a restaurant and a souvenir shop. And of course you have the beautiful view of the city. This is a half day activity altogether. Wear comfortable shoes as up there the paths are not paved. And always bring a sweater or jacket, even if it's hot at the bottom."

I would recommend booking online before and getting there early as it can get very busy with car Peking. We ended up about 500m walk away and got there for 930. I would also recommend following the cable car on Twitter as they regularly post the view and conditions from the top and more importantly if it's open!

But the view was amazing, they have a Wifi Lounge on the top of the mountain that has lovely couches and seating ares as well as a little coffee shop/refreshment shop. The staff were super friendly and very helpful, one even gave us a hug as we got off the car. She also told us where to get Malay style food and was generally very informative."

You can only really say you've seen Cape Town and the Peninsula once you've seen the spectacular views from the top of the mountain.Take something warm though, even on warm days the wind can be chilly up there, and don't feed the dassies and meerkatte which tend to be quite tame.Once you've done the cableway trip, plan your next one on foot :-) Great hikes all over the mountain, but don't do it alone; there have been several incidents of hikers being robbed on the mountain, especially near the cable station."

I arrived at Table Mountain, looked at the cableway, and thought, 'Forget this, I am going to hike. I am not taking the stupid cableway!' Three hours later, when I arrived at the top a giant sweaty mess, I realised that one should obviously take the cableway up and hike DOWN, if hiking is on the agenda. Anyway, that's nether here nor there, as this is about the cableway itself, and all I can say is that the ride is amazing. You go up/down so fast, and the revolving floor ensures everyone gets a 360 degree view. The scenery is absolutely amazing! I came back two days later just to ride the cableway up and down one more time, before I left amazing Cape Town."

We were visiting in the low season and yet were not able to find a car parking space closer than around 300 yds. from the cable car station so be prepared for a some walking even though you intend to take the cable car to the very top! There was only a short queue to buy tickets but I imagine this will not be the same in summer and the advice to pre-buy tickets could be worthwhile. The cars run to the top at a steep angle, the trip only lasting 5 minutes. They are shaped like a donut and revolve horizontally 360 degrees around the central hub so you get to see all sides without having to move about in the car yourself. 5 minutes is not long enough to take it all in! Do choose to do this trip as soon as you have a clear day because very often a cloud seems to gather and hang over this iconic mountain and, if dense enough, the cars do not run."

It is also the country\u2019s most photographed attraction and its famous cable car took millions of people to its top. The Table Mountain Aerial Cableway Company is by far the fastest and easiest way of reaching the summit. Getting to the cable car is easy. Best option is to take the bus as parking spots are hard to come by. Cable car tickets can be purchased at the station or at City Sightseeing Bus drivers.Table Mountain is a terrific scenic photograph background or a place from where you can take a breathtaking photo of Cape Town, and from 2004 was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Consider that the journey to the summit lasts not more than 5-6 minutes, and that the floor of the car rotate through 360 degrees during the ascent, giving passengers a panoramic view and a great emotion. It's really worth to get up!!!"

You wait in line for a short while, then get a nice turning 360 view on capetown and the mountain as you climb up. The view up there is very nice, almost 360 aswell, and even though there are many tourists, it's very calm."

A trip in the cable car to the top of this iconic feature is a must if you are visiting Cape Town.Queues to buy tickets can be very long, with a wait of hours..It is best to book and pay for your ticket online.. you can take the Red City bus tour which will drop you off at the Lower Cable Station and save you the search ( and corresponding long walk) for parking for your car.. Remember to take something warm to wear as it gets cold, a hat and a bottle of water. There is a restaurant at the top - though a picnic overlooking either the city and Table Bay,or the Atlantic Coast on the other side, this takes some beating!"

It is a bit strange at first because it is the floor that turns so this can be a bit disorientating as everybody tries to keep their spot in front of a window that they are actually moving away from. However sanity soon prevails and after a few apologies for toe stepping one can enjoy the view as the car moves up the side. Very polite 'pilot' looks after you while you are in the air and opens doors when you reach your landing. The views are spectacular and if you feel energetic you can put in quite a workout walking around the top. Looking down onto the city and the harbour and out to Robben Island are views that are difficult to forget. On the other side one can see off to Constantia and below is Camps Bay and Clifton. Ideally the trip up the mountain should be done on a clear day with as little wind up top as possible. Any visit to Cape Town must include a trip up the mountain to validate that visit:)."

We knew it would be cloudy at the top as we could see the cable car station from our accommodation.Because it was cloudy, there was no queue to go up on the cable car, so up we went. It was about lunch time so we had our lunch in the caf\u00e9/restaurant at the upper station, which was tasty but cold. Outside, visibility was poor and it was damp, so we didn't linger and came down in short order.A couple of days later we had a gap day and as Table Mountain looked clear we went up again. This was such a different experience, where the queue to go up was an hour (because we hadn't bought tickets in advance). We tried to book whilst in the queue but the Wifi they provide is really weak and incapable of doing much at all. So book you tickets online or on your mobile before you get there if it is sunny.When we got to the top it was, again, so different. The dassies were out (google them!) and there were lizards too. We had a good walk around before coming down, but no lunch this time!Absolutely not to be missed, but if the weather is poor and cloudy you will have to decide for yourself how important it is to go up the mountain, because you really won't see or experience much apart from the cold and the wet."

If you're not a fan of heights then this will be terrifying for you. They really pack everyone in like sardines in a can. The staff member sits in the middle of the cable car on a fixed position & the rest of the floor spins around so everyone gets a good vantage point for the views. Don't try to get a pic when it stops at the top as the staff want you out ASAP so they can load in the next lot of people - to the point that today there was a lady trying to get a selfie at the top & the staff member whistled at her (in the Same manner that you call for your dog) saying to get off. If I had to deal with tourists everyday I'd get a little frustrated too but I found that instance this afternoon to be pretty average.Heaps of staff on the top of the mountain in the main area. We asked a heap of questions & all were super helpful.We caught the cableway up & hiked back down (very steep, rocky & uneven) a great hike but super hard on your knees. We're not super fit & we made it ok- took us 2.5-3hours. Once at the bottom of the trail you then have to walk back up to the lower cable station along the road & down to your car. For where we parked it was roughly 2km further up Hill.Defiantly take water with you & good walking shoes - even if not hiking - there's a heap of paths along the main top area of the mountain.

You also get to the wave to the more energetic who are hiking or rock climbing. There are well marked and laid walkways at the top. Wear suitable shoes as you will want to walk to take in all the viewpoints. In some instances, you will be able to veer off the pathways and these are best handled in sneakers/ walking shoes.Binoculars could be useful.Have sufficient space on your camera for the pictures you will want to take.Good informal restaurant at the top, as well as a decent (though slightly expensive) shop for trinkets.Take a warm top as it can get cooler there, even if it is a hot day in Cape Town. Parking can be difficult to get, so I would suggest getting here earlier. Alternatively, you will have to park further down the winding, steep road and walk up to the bottom cable station. This is mildly strenuous. You can alternatively park you car at the very bottom of the mountain at the parking lot (this is a smaller parking lot) & take a myciti bus up to the top. I am uncertain of this cost.We go up to the top via the cableway at least 3 times a year & obviously enjoy it. Recommended for tourists and locals"

We had our breakfast on the mountain which was an absolutely stunning view. The weather changes without warning so always take a sunhat, a thin jacket and make sure you are wearing comfortable walking shoes. There isn't much to do on the mountain, except take many photos, walk around and search for dassies. Try to make the most of the trip on the mountain - be adventurous and walk further over the mountain. It is lots of fun, just be careful and do not attempt alone. We walked to the other side of the mountain and then down past the gorge to the other part of table mountain. Follow the signs and guidelines. It is tranquil and has more gorgeous views. Enjoy!"

Also wear some comfortable walking shoes as the various walks on top of the mountain are fantastic.If you go up just before lunch you could have something to eat when you reach the summit and then take some or all of the walks and end up with an amazing sun set before you return to the bottom."

The cable car rotates during travel which ensures that you have a 360 view of the scenery around.Only negative is that it is unpredictable and they stop the service if the winds get stronger.

I've marked 4/5 simply because of the length of time we could see nothing. The views, during the clear patches were pretty spectacular and worth waiting for ( though not for 13 years).If you're in Cape Town, you must make the effort to get up \"that bloody mountain\", you won't regret out opportunity."

We were there during the winter (just last week) and so this is considered a low season time. Wow. We lined up for 2 hours before we finally got to the cable car and up to the mountain. Even people who had bought their tickets online had to line up, but their line was definitely quicker, so get tickets online is what I'd advice. They only have 2 cable cars, so the wait is long anyway. I can't imagine what high season looks like. I think they need to rethink their system of moving the line somehow. The wait was quite ridiculous! These comments aren't related to the cable cars themselves. These are really nice and when we were there they'd just done an annual safety check. Plus the floor rotates as you go up which was neat; you can see all around you as you travel up. Just figure out a better way to deal with the line up!"

The staff were quite friendly and efficient at moving the lines along. If you're stuck inside with a view you don't like, no worries, the floor of the cable-car rotates as you climb or descend and you will at least get a quick shot at your desired view. Highly recommend getting on-line tickets (follow the link from their website); we displayed the tickets right on my smart phone. Took an \u00fcber up there and back, parking is a challenge so avoid driving up there yourself. The Table Mountain Aerial Cableway website lists other public transportation options as well. Word of caution, do check the weather forecasts and the cableway web site before buying your tickets. They shut down for low visibilities and or high winds. Tickets are \"timed\" (afternoon or morning of that specific date)."

The ride is fairly quick, and if you are not good with heights you can stand in the center of the car. The car holds about 65 people for each trip, and there are 2 cars that operate. At the top is a cafeteria type restaurant with some hot and cold choices, pizza, wrapped sandwiches, desserts, beer, wine and cider. There are paths to walk, and some charts showing courses you can walk that are 15 min to I think 2 hrs in time. Lots of look out points and areas to take in the view all around the area. The line for the ride down was much shorter, about 10 minutes, so that was a bonus.

I must say that each time I go up, I have a truly uplifting experience regardless of having visited so many times. I think it's just the feeling of being with loved ones on one of the most beautiful mountains in the world makes it different each time. For me, I take the spiritual upliftment of appreciating God's work and it's truly the most astounding views. The food at the shop is also quite good however a bit pricey. Very well maintained though. I will definitely visit again"

Worth getting your tickets online beforehand to avoid queues, you can always get a refund if you don't make it. We got there early before 9 but still short wait in the sun.

It was a fine day with no cloud so it was very busy when we arrived at 8.30 a.m. The queuing system was a little chaotic with supposedly two separate queues for pre-booked tickets and those with no tickets. How the two eventually combined I don't know. It was an hour and a half before we got in a cable car. They each hold about 60 people and leave at 6 or 7 minute intervals. We spent just over an hour at the top and had no problem getting a cable car down at about 11.30 in time to return to our hotel, clear our rooms, store our luggage and grab something to eat before heading to the airport. It was not high season when we went up Table Mountain so I imagine it might be even busier in the summer. It is pretty pointless going up when it is cloudy so this tends to concentrate the passengers."

Plan to get there early, like 7:30, It took us just under 2hrs to get to the top, if it's a little cloudy don't worry because it usually clears up from 10-1. But if it's rainy and forecast is cloudy all day don't do it because you won't see a thing. If climbing up, bring a fleece because it's about 8C/45F at the top.

We took our picnic basket and extra clothing just in case the weather was a little different up the mountain. The Q to buy tickets was not to long (expected it to be longer, were still partially in tourist season). When you go to a huge tourist like Table Mountain, expect to wait, be prepared, don't spoil for yourself even before you get up the mountain. Service at the station and inside the cable car is fantastic. Well organised and perfectly safe, in fact 110% safe. Once on top, you are on your own and should really take responsibility for those with you. There is routes that one can take to get a good view and enjoy the scenery and everything the mountain has to offer. We walked all the way round the longer route and had a wonderful time. (Take your camera) We ate our picnic goodies undisturbed and soaked in the sun while a cool afternoon breeze started blowing. (Luckily we were prepared) The area around the cable station is the busiest and also the place for the best views and photos. The Toilet facilities and restaurant/ shops is also at the station. All in all a great experience and real value for money, something one should do at least once a year if you are lucky enough to live close to the mountain."

Point of concern: on our way back everyone was clamouring on to get down since it was late and the queues were nearly 2 hours, despite the maximum capacity being 64 ppx, I was pretty sure there were more people than that (I counted). Now I don't know whether this compromised safety or they had an internal weighing system that calculates the collective weight onboard, but I felt safety should never be compromised irrespective of the demand of queues waiting to get down.

It is also very popular with tourists. As a result the cable cars get really crowded and everyone can`t get such a perfect view when they go up or down. Unfortunately we pick a day with clouds over the mountain in the hope that it would clear. It did not and the fog caused zero visibility and very cold conditions for most of the day. Needless to say that the restaurant was overflowing. Also there was a group of very noisy rude people shouting and singing all the way. I am afraid to think what it will be like on a sunny day. Still it stays a most beautiful place for a day outing. The views were fantastic when the fog lifted for a while. Robben Island is clearly visible. Don`t go up when clouds hover over the mountain and be prepared to park far away from the lower station."

Look out for the little rodents that live up the Mountain, they are really cute! There is a shop and cafe at the top of Table Mountain.Be aware that if you get a good day then its a great time to go up the mountain, if the wind picks up the cable car does not run and for some tourists this means they never get up the mountain on their visit. You can walk to the top but I was told it takes 2 hours and is quite a climb - so when you get a good day get yourself out to the cable car asap!"

A double decker bus took us around the city and we were allowed to stop at various locations to get a better view of the sights. We got on the tour with the sole aim of stopping at Table Mountain. We were advised to buy tickets at the city sightseeing stand to avoid queues at the mountain ticket stand which we gladly did. It wouldn't have been fun waiting in line with 2 kids under the age of 6. As we climbed higher and higher towards our destination, I must say I was a little intimidated. I don't like heights but it was very safe on the bus. Once there, we went straight to the elevators which took us up to a landing to get on the Aerial Cableway. It was a hitch free accession to the top of the mountain on the cable car. Once we arrived, we passed through gift shops before we were finally let out to an open space on the mountain top. The views were spectacular. There's also a cafe where you can sit to enjoy a small meal with the family. After that, there isn't much else to do but see the cape from various angles. We got some beautiful photos as well.Going down was more eventful. Our cable car driver was quite entertaining and made us laugh almost the whole way down. I highly recommend this activity. It's a once in a lifetime thing you don't want to miss out on. Side note, we had a stroller for my 2 year old and we were able to take it with us every step of the way. It's a family friendly attraction."

As you rise, it slowly rotates so that by the time you get to the top, if you have held a single location at the window, you will have turned in all directions to see the sights. The rotation is relatively rapid so it can still be challenging to get the photos that you want. The cable car is not unusual, but it is in a beautiful area."

We joined the few people at the counter and got our 20% discounted tickets with our Wild Card, after showing ID and receipt. It\u2019s a five-minute cable car trip to the top of Table Mountain, 1089 meters above Cape Town. Each of the two cable cars can carry 65 people. The floor of the circular cabin rotates to allow 360\u00b0 views. Interesting tidbit: The cable car base is a water tank with a 4000 liter capacity. This provides fresh water for visitors, and is used as ballast in windy condition! We enjoyed the views and explored the summit. There are numerous hiking trails. We came down by 4 PM."

One benefit is that the cars rotate so everyone gets to have good views on the trip. Once you reach the top of table mountain the views are spectacular. You can spend as much time on the mountain as you want ( as long as the cable cars are still operating). A trip up table mountain is a must do when in Cape Town and I would highly recommend it."

There was more than a two hour wait for the ride up because I think some locals decided to visit that day, which made it busier than normal. The organization for a large line-up was impressive. Just as for Robben Island, do Table Mountain on your first day in Cape Town that appears to have good weather. The weather changes very quickly and dramatically but try to get a good feel for it before committing. The tram still runs if it is foggy, but you won\u2019t see a thing. However, it shuts down if it is windy, which doesn\u2019t affect the experience as much. Tourism Cape Town will know whether the tram is currently running, or check online. This was basically a full day experience for me because of the long wait (not so long on the way down) and because I walked around the scenic pathways and savored the spectacular unique views and fynbos vegetation. The paths are easy and you won\u2019t get lost, but watch out for uneven footing surfaces in some areas."

Queues can be very long at times I believe, but at 9.30 on a Sunday morning we got straight through. The cableway staff were all very courteous & helpful & all the equipment / facilities were very clean & well maintained. The restaurant/ gift shop were fine, but souvenirs are approx twice the price as those at the V&A waterfront.There are free short guided walks available on the hour & well worth doing- just ask staff where to join.

The cableway is an easy and convenient way of seeing the stunning views over Cape Town.I would recommend getting a ticket in advance as this helps to avoid some of the queue at the cableway itself.The status of the cableway can also be checked at #tmweather which we found helpful as the weather can change quickly meaning the cableway can be closed in the morning but opened up if/when the weather improves. If you are going on a winter afternoon it's worth taking a jacket as the temperature is slightly cooler at the top and also there can be long queues to get back on the cablecar as everyone seems to head back down at roughly the same time."

The attendants assured us that everyone would be transported down (there were some frantic parents in the line behind us).However we had used the red city sightseeing buses to get to table mountain.

Since we went at this time, there were also fewer people up there. if it is very windy, they may close for a while but then open later in the day. You can also walk up the mountain [there are small stone paths to use] and then take the cable car down. The floor of the cable car turns so you get a full 360 view-it is great!

            "review": "One of best cable ways on the planet. One of Cape Towns most famous tourist attractions and activities is a trip up or down Table Mountain in the cable car. It is a highly popular attraction. The most important point is to check the weather forecast and only use the car when the weather is good and when cloud on the mountain is not forecast. Also to dress in layers and to ensure that one will be warm enough. The weather on top of the mountain can change in almost minutes. So even if you go up on a hot day, take enough warmth. When up on top perhaps take a walk around always observing the safety instructions and advice. Keep away from the edge of cliffs. When up on top consider eating or having a drink at the lovely restaurant. Or perhaps take along a picnic and have it on top of the mountain while admiring the stunning views of the Cape Peninsular and surrounds. Parking at the foot of the mountain can be challenging and the lines can be long. Be preparedness for this. Try and go early if you want to minimize crowds or time spent waiting. Alternatively, take a late afternoon trip and watch the sun set out west over the Atlantic Ocean."

I recommend that the first day you have a clear mountain top you make immediate plans to go. The tour is free and worth the 30 minutes to learn about the views and plants that you will be seeing. If you are healthy and fit you can climb to the top and ride the Cable Car down but you should do this with a local. There are frequent visitors who get stopped for their cell phones and wallets. We enjoyed eating at the top so if possible allow time around a meal time. If you hike it is FREE but allow several hours each way and know that if the fog rolls in you will have to hike back down."

Even at about 9am in the morning in off season there were cars parked a long way from the Cableway station and people were having to walk long distances. You can also use the parking at Kloof Neck and table the free bus up to the Cableway. It is worth walking away from the main area on top of the mountain to the less developed paths were one can enjoy the peace and the scenery better"

We all know that table mountain is the biggest attraction in Cape Town, we also know that the Cableway is the simplest form of traversing its height. I have lived in Cape Town for most of my life and can tell you that you need to pick your time carefully. You have winds from the oceans behind pushing moisture above the mountain, where it supercools and forms the 'tablecloth'. On days like these, you'll find terrible visibility. As a rule of thumb, mornings are better than afternoons, the earlier, the better. The difference between taking the cableway on a clear or overcast day is immense. It is one of the most beautiful places that one can visit, but don't be stuck at the top, unable to see 2 meters ahead of you.I would advise waking up, looking out the window at the mountain and then deciding then and there whether it's a great day for it. Rather postpone it for a day then go up and not enjoy yourself.Hope this helps!"

Visited here January 2016 , drove in hire car and found it best to park in lower car park which runs a shuttle bus up to the cable car entrance ,every ten mins or so and no charge .It would be easy enough to walk but quite a busy road so we used the bus .Got of bus to see a large queue waiting for tickets and then to access the cable car itself ,I have to say it was very well managed and within half an hour or so we got into the car itself .The cars hold 50 odd people who all want the best view at the rear......or that's what we thought but as we set off the floor began to revolve very slowly giving everyone a chance of the best views which was great engineering .As you'd expect stunning views but pick your day as mountain can be covered in cloud."

Once on top the walks around the area are well sign posted and take you a number of great vantage points for views over cape town and surrounds. Recommend walking quickly away from the top station for best views and also out of range of the annoying selfy stick brigade."

Once you are there, then its great views, amazing pictures to be taken and very nice walks. Good place for a lunch, read a book, and just relax/unwind.One the way down, take the cable car, as its great to be down in a few mins.Best advice - buy a one-way ticket and trek up."

Almost silent if you're prepared to walk for a few minutes away from the other tourists.A nice little coffee shop up there adds to the overall experience.I avoided the shop with the usual tacky tourists gifts so can't comment too much on that.Overall a really excellent experience, no queuing for the cable cars, and much more freedom at the top than I had imagined."

Pre-purchasing tickets will ensure that you don't spend a few hours in line to buy your ticket. Initially we were in line to wait for tickets, but the wait time was well over an hour. A few minutes on the smart phone and I had tickets for us. There was only a small wait - less than 20 minutes to board the cableway. The ride up was incredible. If you are afraid of heights or with someone who's afraid of heights, be sure they are in the middle of the car. The floor rotates as it travels on the cable, so that was a bit much for my afraid of heights companion who had the death grip on the inside guardrail handle... she freaked when the car began to move and an announcement cautioned not holding onto the guardrail and the floor started rotating. Once at the top, there's a well-appointed restaurant that serves beer, wine and mixed drinks... The restaurant had lots of selections and the gift shop had lots of curios and touristy stuff. If it's a clear day, this activity is not to be missed as you can literally see to the end of the earth!"

Some advise though, don't even attempt the trip if there is cloud over the mountain (the famous table top), you will be very disappointed. Try to book your ticket online, it saves you a long wait in the ticket queue. Food at the top is a little expensive so pack your own picnic lunch, it is worth spending a good few hours exploring the top of the mountain as it is pretty expensive to get there. It is also deceptively high up there and can therefore get pretty cold at times even though the bottom will appear warm, pack a nice warm top or light blanket."

Those with tickets were in one queue, those without had to queue to buy them, then queue for the cable car to the top (it's lucky I know how to spell queue).One at the front of the queue you get into a lift ... This takes you to the cable car. Cable cars are not something I like at all so I settled myself by the handrail with my back to the mountain eyes shut at the ready. We set off and as soon as we did the guy advised us all to let go of the handrail as he said the car floor rotated. Shock horror!!! It revolved all the way round, slowly, I didn't look as I can't stand heights (yes I know..., table mountain is high but my hubby really wanted to go). Once there it was nice. I didn't look down but looking out gave wonderful views. There is a cafe, shop, you can stay as long as you like up top but, be aware the weather can change at any time and if it does the cable car does not operate!!! Long walk down! Look out for the Dassie's. A bit like Guinea pigs but bigger and they roam quite freely up there. They seem to like the crowds. Be prepared for the queue to go down again. For those like me, who don't like heights or cable cars.... It was worth it!"

Lines can get long, I am toD, but we were advised to purchase our tickets before we went up to the lift (a very good idea) and to go early. First car up on the Sunday that we visited departed at 8:30 a.m., although they advertise the site as opening at 8. We were in the first car up, and we were rewarded with the entire mountaintop virtually to ourselves. Depending on the season, the dassies may not be awake and running around if you go up too early. The view of the city is spectacular - don't miss this if you're visiting Cape Town."

If travelling by car there is parking both as you climb the road before the cable car and also after it. On the way up the parking attendants will try to encourage you to park which would mean a steep climb to the cable car. My advice is to continue past the cable car and try to park on the level section and only if there are no spaces turn around and park at the first available spot going back down."

At the same time I glanced back over my shoulder looking out for the last of my guests, as the group had already boarded. I did not realize that at that moment my cash fell out of the purse. I then dashed to the cable car as the door was just closing.Upon arriving at the bottom James was already waiting as the door opened, asking me if I or somebody from my group had lost money. I asked all my guests - but nobody had lost money. Before leaving the shop a little voice in the back of my head said: \"you better check your purse\". Only then did I realize that I had lost all my cash. I went back to James who contacted the top station. Believe it or not, my money was returned to me with the next cable car coming down.James would not accept a reward and explained that all the staff working at Table Mountain Aerial Cableway took pride in their work and excellent customer service was their goal.James and his colleagues more than reach this goal.Table Mountain Aerial Cableway can not only be proud of one of the new 7 wonders of nature but also their staff.Thank you James, thanks to everybody at Table Mountain Aerial Cableway for doing a great job.Erika Smith / Guide"

And I am so glad I did.My first stop was the restaurant/deli they have up there and got myself a slice of pizza and a beer. They have options for everyone from young to old, and older! There is a selection of hot food and snacks, beer and wine, soft drinks and slushies, coffee and cake. It is a decent quality and not crazily overpriced. Weather was perfect, couldn't actually go up on my birthday but you can go and collect your ticket with your ID and then use the ticket in 7 days, so I waited until I had the right weather. Please remember to wear sun-block if you go up and comfortable shoes as you have to walk far to get to all sides and on rocks.You know I see this mountain every day and marvel at it, but being on top of it just made me fall in love with it even more."

We were told the queue will be more than 1 hour when we went to Stop 5 early in the morning to purchase our tickets, longer for those without. So, if you haven't pre-purchase, go online and purchase your tickets during the queue. The cable car floor rotates 360 degrees, giving you an all round spectacular view. Make sure your camera is fully charged;you will not stop taking photos. Better still, bring extra battery or back-up chargers. Most people will be keen to help take your photos; just make sure you return the favours.This is the easiest way to get to the top of Table Mountain (or down).There are lots to see at the top. Allocate enough time to take it all in; you will realise why the queue is so long!"

All up hill (be sure and practice the stair master before you come). It was intense for me, but all totally worth it. Cafe up at the top serves a great ostrich pie, with breathtaking views of the bay and Cape Town below. Definitely recommend taking the cable car back town, it turns as you descend so you can see the mountain and city below from different angles no matter where you're placed in the car inside. Only about R250 one way for 2 people."

On busy days , you might end up walking more than a kilometre uphill, depending on where you get parking.Taking a Cab or the bus(i believe it's bus 101) is a far better option.the cab ride is around 80 rand from the city / VA water front.Buy your tickets online to avoid the massive queue. Check the weather in the morning before booking the cable car. The weather is a big factor in capetown. Table mountain is closed during cloudy / rough weather conditions. Take a real camera(not the one on the camera) , wear comfortable shoes and set aside half a day for this awesome experience."

Revolving floor in cable car meant everyone was able to get a good view as we went up and down. Great views and several paths to walk around on at the top."

There are lots of discussions regarding long waits to access the cable car, so I can provide a datapoint: I went about 2pm in the afternoon and I had no queue whatsoever.The cable car is quick and efficient, and the floor spins so everyone can take in the views. If you have a fear of heights, then the centre section doesn't spin so sitting here will prevent you being exposed to the open sides.The views from the top of Table Mountain are breathtaking, and it's eerily silent. You can easily spend an hour walking around the summit and taking in views from all sides. And there are dassies! Just ensure your visit coincides with little cloud cover, and buy your ticket online the day before (it's valid a week)."

The cable car has a turntable floor which turns 180 degrees while traveling up to the mountain, so you get to see it all before you get to the top. We went at Easter and the only fault was that we had to queue for around 1-1/2 hours but in saying that it was well worth it, I'm not sure if it would have been this busy if it wasn't over Easter. You can pre book your ticket but if it is windy the cable car doesn't run and you don't get a refund. Would definitely recommend, you can hike up the mountain instead if you are reasonable fit and that takes around 2 hours I think. There is souvenir shops on the top along with a cafe and some furry little animals."

Then, when we arrived, the views from the top were fantastic! You could see the rocky coast and some beautiful beaches from all sides. There were trails down to the bottom, and I met 4 young local people who had climbed up the mountain. Many others were climbing various paths to the top. There are several routes of varying difficulty for people who range from mildy athletic to advanced mountain climbers with pitons and ropes. Weather varies on this mountain: some days, it is too windy or rainy for the gondola to run. Fantastic trip. My day, Sunday, May 1 was ideal! Perfect weather, no mist or clouds on the Mountain! Definitely a worthwhile trip!"

On the day of arrival the Cable Car was operating but the sun was out & Camps Bay was calling. On the next two days, every time we looked up, the mountain was covered in Cloud. Not again i was thinking.. Day 4 was a glorious day and we had booked to do the Peninsula Tour. Once we returned to our accommodation it was pasted 17.00 and again we turned down the opportunity. Day 5. yet more cloud & wind. Day 6 came and we woke to views of the cloud over the Mountain again. We decided to have Breakfast out and started to think, we had two opportunity's and we turned it down. Whilst eating Breakfast, the sun began to come out, within 5 minutes, the cloud had lifted & we could see the Mountain, fully cleared and the cable car was operating. Within Ten Minutes, and a Short Taxi ride we were in the queue. We had been told by murmurous people, that we could buy Tickets from Pick N Pay in advance so you could split the first queue. Did we, nope. Thankfully the queue was short, only six people in front of us just after 0930.. and no queue for the Cable car. We waited five minutes & we were on our way up.. The views from the Top of the Mountain are Incredible. We could see for miles.. after the walk around which took 35 - 40 mins we returned to the cable car for the return journey. When we returned to the bottom of the Cable Car the Queues were 400 -500 long. Luck was with us. You can be lucky like ourselves or you could be behind two or three tour buses, but the cable car can take 50 -60 people at a time so the queue is always moving.. My advise, if you see the Cable Car operating. Go straight away. The sky might be clear but the Wind can easily stop it operating."

The trail is pretty clearly marked although it got a bit confusing once. Keep in mind that I am a novice hiker. Once we got to the top, it was well worth it. We were greeted with an amazing view and a solid sense of accomplishment. Refreshments and a gift shop awaited us and we took our time before heading down via the cableway. The cableway is about a 3 minute ride with a rotating outer shell that allows a 360 degree view of the mountain and of Cape Town. It is also very reasonably priced. Highly recommended!"

On the spur of the moment we decided to take the cable car up Table Mountain. After finding parking (not easy) we joined the que to buy tickets. Suggestion - buy your tickets online to avoid standing in line. The que was long but moved relatively quickly. The ticket seller was very friendly and polite. The cable car is impressive and my kids loved the trip up. It was windy at the top and in spite of the weather being warm down below it was far colder on top. Hint - always bring a jacket! We had a walk around the top. Views utterly stunning! We had lunch at the cafe which was busy but efficiently run. Our food was a little cold by the time we got to our table but not inedible. We popped into the curio shop - waaaaay too expensive for the average South African but considering we didn't hear a South African accent for the entire time we were up there perhaps understandable. The curio shop was the original retaurant that holds a special place in my heart as it was designed by my grandfather. We nearly froze whilst standing in line to go down but we made it. The Table Mountain experience is something all South Africans can be proud of. One issue - the whole visit cost us over R1000! That is very expensive for a South African family and I would like to suggest that they offer discounts for SA citizens like the Kruger National Park does."

BOOK your tickets online!!! we went up Table Mountain on the first clear day we had, so did everyone else ! even with Pre Paid tickets we queued for 90 minutes to get into the cable car, the ride up was good and interesting as the floor revolved slowly so you could get a full 360' view of the mountain and surrounding area. Upon reaching the top, my husband went to re join the queue for the cable car ride down the mountain as it was already at the 90 minute queue time. (he had been here before) myself and the children walked around the paths where you could see all the way down to Cape Point and just as far in all directions, beautiful. There is a cafe at the top, but again we had to queue to get in and buy snacks, before rejoining my husband in the queue.TIP : get there EARLY, before it opens even!"

Table Mountain is a must visit for any tourist in Cape Town - I made a joke while I was in Cape Town that Capetownians climb Lions Head because Tourist are on Table Mountain and boy is that the truth! While the Cableway is only available weather permitting it offers amazing views of Cape Town and the surrounding areas as it ascends and descends - If you are an avid climber you can choose to climb up or down Table mountain or even use the cable car on one of the ways. The Mountain itself is beautiful with animals, reptiles and plenty of fauna and flora to keep you occupied - aside from the view which is most important. The shop at the top has options for anyone needing a curio, and the restaurant has options for all pockets, from wine to beers, pizza, biscuits and more! This should definitely be a stop on your Cape Town Bucket-list!!"

Check whether the cableway is open on the day of intended visit on the official website tablemountain.net (they will give temperature, visibility stats and wind speed). If cableway is closed, your tickets will still be valid for the next 7 days and if you can't visit at another time your tickets can be refunded.

My husband and I stayed for just 4 days of March in Cape Town (should have stayed longer). We were warned that the cable car does not operate if the wind is too strong and, obviously, there is no point going up if visibility is poor. On the second day of our Cape Town visit the day seemed ok, we went up, visibility was so-so, we had a lovely walk looking at clouds below us, and suddenly the sky turned blue and the city and the ocean were there. We did not book in advance, we did not have to queue, the place was busy, but when you walk you don't feel the crowds around you, just occasional meetings. We loved it, as we loved the whole South African experience,"

Know that the queue for prepaid (online) tickets was the exact same length as the queue without tickets, so you both wait an equal amount of time.The view from the top was totally underrated, I was blown away by the beauty of our own city.Next time, I want to hike up the track then just take the cable car down, or take the sunset trip - that would be unreal!Proud Cape Tonian."

It's a pretty worthwile experience for views of the city and ocean and a look around the top.The quiet time to visit seems to be in the afternoon. We bought our tickets online at lunchtime, the same day we visited the mountain at around 3:30. All you need to show for entry is the ticket on your tablet/iPad and they can scan it from your screen. It's quite squishy inside the cable car, so either wait to be the last on or the first on to get a place next to the windows. The floor of the cable car spins 360degrees while you are inside which is pretty cool.When you are up there you can go walk around the top. You would expect it to be flat but it's a bit rocky, sensible shoes allow you to explore many different viewing points.Dassies seem to hang around the caf\u00e9 which is an added cute bonus so make sure you keep an eye out for them.We left on one of the last cars, at around 6:20pm. It's nice to stay up there for sunset. You can buy beers from the caf\u00e9 on the top of the mountain for sundowners. Bring a light jacket as it gets cooler around this time."

A great and quick way to get to the top of Table Mountain for the amazing view but be prepare to wait during peak periods. We were there in late March and even though we arrive at 8:30 am to hike up the mountain, there was already a long queue. Three hours after our climb, the queue was still there, if not, longer! Bring a sweater as weather can be a lot cooler at the top."

It wasn't too crowded when we arrived at the lower terminal but we were glad that we had bought our tickets in advance as although the ticket queuing area is does have a shade it can still be very very hot, the sun's strength is deceiving. The cable car rotates as it ascends and descends so everyone gets a good all round view view."

The weather had been rainy in Cape Town all week but just before were due to fly home we had our opportunity.It was pretty busy, but the staff were efficient at moving the crowds and people we're generally in a great spirits making for a fun atmosphere. I recommend booking online ahead of your trip so you can take advantage of the quicker entry- it's easy to do and they even have free wifi at the entrance so you can do your booking as you arrive.The views were as expected - amazing! And the facilities at the top are good. We spent a few hours up there and had the chance to see the sun set over Cape Town as we descended.It's a wonderful afternoon out if you're in Cape Town and you should miss out. One thing to note is that if the weather gets too windy while you are up at the top... They might have to close the cable car... So be prepared to walk down (2-3hrs) if the sky is cloudy when you go! Haha!"

Cable car takes about 2-3mins to travel each way and spins around so everyone can get a good photo.When at the top of the mountain it was cold - lots of people braving it in t-shirts and you could tell they were freezing. A jumper, jeans and windproof coat will sort it. The top of the mountain is well developed, good paths, viewpoints, toilets and a restaurant."

Two tips however: make sure you book your tickets via the easy link on their website (valid a week); and allow plenty of time for your visit if the weather is clear and especially if a Cruise ship is in harbour."

This was our first visit and as we did not know what to expect at the top of the mountain we were surprised that everything was well organized including a restaurant where you can have breakfast with a great view! We went early in the morning and although there were many people the queue moved and we did not have to wait for long both the way up and also down. It is a great experience and would recommend it if travelling to Cape Town."

If there is a white \" tablecloth \" across the mountain it isn't worth going up the cable car as your views are limited .The restaurant at the top has a self service section and a coffee bar with cakes , but the seating is quite limited . You can also buy alcohol in the shop and souvenirs .During summer they run specials where you can stay at the top of the mountain and watch the sunsets .In peak season it is best to go early to avoid the very long queues .An absolute must if you are visiting Cape Town for the first time !"

Best to buy your tickets online to avoid the huge queues during peak season time and therefore you will be spending more time in line rather than on top. The cable cars are frequent, safe and rotate as they go up so that you get a 360 degree view of the bay and the city. It's fabulous. The cable car attendants have a great sense of humour. The trip we made had a Chinese couple in the cable car and suddenly the South African attendant started speaking in fluent Cantonese... A very surreal but brilliant moment for the Chinese couple...

We visited Cape Town whilst on a cruise and one of the highlights of our three day stay in this great city was the ride on the cableway up to the top of Table Mountain. As I use a mobility scooter, I was not sure how accessible this attraction would be but I need not have worried. There was a lift which bypassed the steps leading up to the cable car and the car itself was simple to access as the entrance to the car was completely level. The journey itself was fantastic, the car turns 360 degrees as it travels to the top station so, no matter where you stand in the car you get to see a full panorama. The views from the top are stunning too and an experience not to be missed."

In the good old days there was no need to book, no online was around. You rocked up at Lower Tafelberg , no long queues, just hop onto the old Cable car, no revolving floor and away they go.Return trip stress-free no long queues to stand in.However much has changed over the years and it is recommended to buy your ticket online, we did at Pick'n Pay, they do at selected outlets. Be sure to buy a return ticket to avoid hiking down if you never intended to and keep your ticket handy for the return trip.Tickets booked online are valid for 7 days from date of intended travel so it gave us a good few day's grace when the cableway was closed due to poor weather conditions.You can check the website for weather updates and whether the cableway is operating or not.Parking at Upper Station can be very limited so suggest one of the following options.1.If you are using the Red hop on hop off bus, you can buy the tickets from the office at the Aquarium on the V and A Waterfront or from the driver of the bus before it gets to stop 7 which is the Upper Tafelberg Rd.The hop on bus will take you to the very top so no long walking needed.2.From the waterfront you can use the My-citi bus and get off at the Civic Centre.From the Civic Centre there is a bus that connects to lower Tafelberg Rd. At the lower Tafelberg Rd there is a free My-citi bus that transports you to the top at the cable way entrance.3.Likewise park your car at the lower Tafelberg Rd My-citi bus station and connect with the free bus.If the Sunset option is the one you choose at a cost of about R100-- after 6 p.m., remember to get down in time to connect with the bus as the last My-citi goes down at 7p.m.A few words of advice when going up the mountain. Most important wear flat comfortable NON-SLIP shoes at all times.Children should be seen to at all times.The exit from the caf\u00e9 is a bit tricky for prams so caution is advised.Perhaps there could be additional handrails installed for added safety for children and adults alike on top of the mountain.Cable car did have a technical hitch the time we were about to board as there was a problem with the doors on one of the cars and people were suspended mid-air for about 20 to 30 mins. So expect these issues however rare.Staff are very helpful and friendly . Don't expect to pay ground prices 1km up in the air on a mountain-top cafeteria !!!"

This is why the queues get so long, I think. We arrived at the top as the sun was setting, had a quick look round and then joined the line to get down again. We queued for over an hour in the gathering dark, watching the lights go on down I the city and the stars come out. Not the best way to end the evening!My advice would be book online to avoid the ticket queues and don't go up for sunset unless you're prepared for a long wait to get back down again!"

If you have already purchased your tickets it's one less queue- tickets are valid for 7 days, you need to specify a date for the cable car when you purchase the tickets, make this the day after you arrive and then watch the weather. If you know it's going to be clear go to the cable car- get there early! Plan to get to the base of the cable car for about 7.30 am. You'll have to wait for it to open at 8.00am, but once it's open you'll be in the first or second car going up. The waiting time in the queue gets longer, very quickly!- despite it being almost 20 degrees at the base of the cable car it is still very nippy on top of the mountain, take a jumper!- I wouldn't bother with the photo shopped photos you can buy from the shop once you get back down, they are not great quality and expensive.The views are stunning and the entire attraction is very well run and organised. All the staff are friendly and helpful too."

The queueing system was somewhat inefficient and even people with pre booked tickets waited for a long time. The day was very hot, so make sure you have a hat, sun cream and water when you go because the queue is not always in the shade. However once you get near, there are water sprinkles.

Having ridden many cableways and mountain lifts in Europe and the US, this is as nicely done as any. The restaurant at the top is better than many. Go first thing in the morning, and have it somewhat to yourself, before the winds get cranked up to shut down the cable car, the tour buses arrive, or the \"tablecloth\" cloud cover rolls in to block your view. Buy tickets online from home, to avoid the first queue\u2014they are good for one use on any day of a seven-day period, and they are refundable if you never actually use them. Sneakers are fine, but you could stumble in the wrong footwear, as the footing at the top is rocky. Enjoy both the views and the wildlife."

An efficient queuing system means that the rigmarole of waiting is nicely oiled and you will also have an opportunity for photos before you arrive at the cable car. We used it for our descent only, after a good climb up Platterklip Gorge, to be kind to tired knees. One way cost R125 each. The floor rotates slowly so you can get a 360 degree view of this iconic city. Just be sure you don't have anything that might get caught in circulation and know that not everybody in the world knows how to queue...! I asked the guys who operate the car if they were bored with just riding up and down all day. \"No ma'am,\" came the reply, \"every 4 minutes we meet new people.\" Wonderful!"

It was icy cold when we waited for the cable cars, but once we were up the mountain, the weather couldn't be better. I'd definitely go up again when in Cape Town again! Lovely views of CPT. TIPS: Book the tickets online - it's much quicker when you already have your ticket in hand (no need to print them out as they can be scanned from the phone). Also, book a ticket for after 13:00. The waiting time is much less after 14:00 to go up. "

The cable cars rotate 360 degrees on the ride up and down, to give everyone an equal view of the stunning vistas. At the top, you can have coffee, drinks or snacks before or after a walk of the top. You are able to roam freely to the edges (or OVER) so keep a close hold on those wandering children.Check the weather and go on a cloudy windless day if you can - it was wonderful. For those who are adventurous and energetic, you can climb up and / or climb down, or use the long hiking path up and / or down."

Our wait was slightly shortened when we figured out we could buy tickets through our phone--which we did. However, once you have tickets, there is still a longer than preferred wait. The cable ride up the mountain is quick and in a way it is almost too fast, as the views are great---with the horrific lines, there is no way they could slow the rides up and down. I am pleased we did it. We were lucky it was a clear beautiful day---quite windy, but worth doing once. Just be sure to buy tickets ahead of time, and don't go on a weekend if you can manage that."

We purchased our tickets with the disclaimer if the winds were to pick up we would have to make the trip back down by foot. It was breezy (bring jackets), but no trek down for us.

We got to the cable car lower station about 8.45am after a c 10 minute walk from our roadside parking spot - your cars are monitored by car 'guards' and it is well worth it for the modest cost.We didn't buy our tickets in advance - you never quite know what the wind or visibility may be. We were pleasantly surprised at the smallish queue to buy tickets - R240 each - ticket booths were efficient which is more than can be said in previous years. There was then a c 20 minute queue for a cable car - quite happy with that - they try to get you to have your photo taken for a souvenir - if you don't want to and it is not mandatory, just politely decline as we did.I am not great with heights but had no problems in the cable car itself which hold 65 - think they can get 800 people up to the top in an hour. Coming down around midday we had a c 20 minute queue for the 'car'. Whilst perhaps stating the obvious, it less busy early or later- if you go in the middle of the day you may well get superseded by the punters from the omni present coach tours.A good overall experience and better than I dared hope for queuing wise."

This was my third visit to Table Mountain, the first over 25 years ago, and still it takes my breath away.Make sure that you get there early if you can. A good idea, if you are able to walk a bit of a distance, is to park at the car park at the 'foot' of the mountain and walk up to the mountain, it is a steep walk but good to get the blood flowing. A shuttle bus also runs from there. If you arrive late-ish parking may be a bit of a problem as this is a busy venue.Try to buy tickets online. We did not, and the queue for non ticket holders were over an hour to buy a ticket. We quickly jumped on the free wifi and bought a ticket online (you can pay with a non-SA credit / debit card without problems) and manage to jump into the online ticket queue. This made our wait go down to less than 20 minutes to get to the cable car queue.The staff was ever so friendly. Helpful and really made the experience that extra bit special. The cable cars rotate whilst going up and down the mountain - so no point to try and rush for an open window - it will come to you as long as you can stand near the outside part of the car.For those of you who are a bit afraid of heights - there is a seating area in the center of the car to sit on - it helps to make the ride go smoother.Once up on table mountain and being able to stabilize my legs the views were breath taking. Around every corner is a new amazing view of Cape Town and her surroundings.We saw Dassies and many lizards, the Dassies are wild animals but are rather use to us humans - but treat them with respect and don't feed them.A restaurant serves food once on the mountain top. Not the most amazing of food services but it sure filled the gaps!The ride down was just as breath taking as going up (I won't know about the going up to be honest as I could not watch, but got the courage to stand at the end whilst going down - it was amazing!).For the brave there is also a route to hike up the mountain - be prepared to have a good long hike, I reckon around two hours up. Summer time - make sure to take lots of sun cream - I looked like a delicious lobster after the day on the mountain.If you can, be sure to visit this wonderful place."

We were worried that the line was so long that we were going to wait for hours - less than 30 minutes and we were on board. Friendly staff. Nice restaurant in top. Be prepared for sudden change in weather - rain wind cold (chilly) and hot on same day. If you do feel up to a different experience - take a walk to the top and use cable act to come down - must start early as it is not an easy stroll. If you like hiking then walking up on one of various routes is worth it. Make sure people know which route you take and when you depart. Don't forget enough water and food should you need to take shelter."

            "review": "Recommended by Lion World Travel. The Cable Car that takes you up Table Mountain is large and holds quite a few people. The inside floor turns as you ride up and down so that you can see all vistas. It is not for the faint of heart for it travels quite quickly and it almost looks like you will crash into the face of the stone mountain when you reach the top! But it is a well made mode of transportation and is safe and definitely worth the ride! Make sure you book the tickets beforehand through the Internet site or your travel agent for the lines to buy tickets were very long. I do want to mention here that our travel agency, Lion World Travel, did an amazing job at booking everything for our trip! Laurandie du Preez, our agent, was amazing and very professional, answering all my questions quickly, and just ensuring that every hotel, every tour, every detail was done to perfection! I'd definitely recommend using her for your South African travel arrangements!"

If travelling there by car there is now a car park that provides a free shuttle to the base station. Most people suggest the best time to visit is early morning as you can beat the tour bus crowds but mid to late afternoon can also miss them however, although you may not have to queue to get up you can sometimes spend 30 - 60 minutes queuing to get down !! Finally do check the cableway is open before travelling there as it closes when it is too windy or if there is too much cloud.

It is better to go up early in the morning, reason being you can not trust the weather it can just change in metter of minutes and the cable is closed if there is a fog.Please buy the tickets online this will save you time, I saw signs on the que communicating the time you are away from the ticket booth and you can be in a que up to 45 min. When I was on top of the mountain I learned that there is a foot path that will take you up to 3hrs depending on your pace and used cable on your way down or vice versa.You are allowed to bring your own refreshments as the tea rooms are expensive, the food is prepared in the shop/ restaurant in the mountain is super, carry some 5 rand coins for binoculars or bring your own. The flowers flowra is amazing and it is believed to be found in the ocean and only in the table mountain in SA and that support the argument that the mountain was under the sea at one point.Please bring 3l of water for drinking purpose.The is a free tour for kinds and family but did not make use off."

So a few tips: check the weather and go early as cloud comes in in the afternoon; buy your ticket before you go, either through a travel agent or as part of the Hop-on, Hop-off red bus service. You'll avoid the queues.Believe it or not the souvenir shop at the top is cheaper than some of those in town! Take water, the altitude dehydrates you.If you've got a snazzy camera take photos, but otherwise buy some postcards or a book, the pix on your phone just don't do the views justice.Enjoy."

We didn't book the cableway in advance in case it was cloudy on top but arrived around 10am on a Wednesday morning and there was no queue. Lots of cars were parked on the steep access road so a good tip is to drive up to the top past the cable car and part on the flat or catch the shuttle bus. The mountain is just over 1,000m high and the trip up is short but stunning - the cable car revolves as you go up. At the top the views are amazing. We then did the one-hour (each way) walk out to the end of the mountain which is mostly flat, except for one steep gorge. Sensible footwear recommended! You can also walk all the way down but having done the walk along the top we didn't bother - the info says you need to know what you're doing and be careful. You can follow the cableway page on Facebook and get updates on the conditions: the wind can get up suddenly and then the cableway stops running. There is a cafe and shop at the top (naturally) and lots of people seemed to have come up for lunch - this option would suit the less adventurous."

I couldn't find anything similar in town. We walked around a bit, took lots of pictures and enjoyed the views. We were visited by several dassies who came out to us and sat quite patiently waiting for their photos to be taken. Cute! Please remember not to touch or feed them.

When in Cape Town one should go and see Table Mountain and going up in the Cableway is definitely part of the experience.We parked our car at the Lower Table Mountain parking area and took the free shuttle bus [MyCity line 110] up to the entrance and back down again. This is a nice service but be aware that the bus only goes every 15 minutes or so and stops to run altogether around 18.30 or 19.00 - miss the last bus and you will have to walk back down [or take a cab].If you haven't reserved tickets online the wait to purchase them can be quite long. You will be waiting under a roof with watersprayers [for cooling] which makes it not too unpleasant but still, pre-booking is much easies and faster.Once you have your tickets you will queue up again to get into the Cableway and that can also be quite a wait [with no cooling sprayers].I am not 100% sure but I think the cableway cars [there are two inservice] can carry up to 65 people per ride and take about 10 minutes to go up to the top. On a busy day your wait can be quite long but you will be rewarded with incredible views from the top and the ride up itself is really nice - the inside of the cabin is actually rotating and makes roughy a 180 degree turn on the way up/down and you get to see wonderful views - a quick tip: when getting into the car to go up find a place immediately to the right of the entrance, that way you will have the view of Cape Town and the Bay rather than the mountain."

It still took about 40 min to get to to the top, but it would have been even longer had I not done so.What to do at the top - Once you get to the top, the areas to the left and right of the cablecar offer scenic views below. If you have a clear day, take advantage; you never know when the mountain will be shrouded in clouds or high winds. In addition, there is a decent cafe that serves food and alcohol with some of the best views in town. Additionally, there are several hiking trails, I believe 3 in total. You can go around the entire perimeter and that will take you slightly over 2 1/2 hours. The signs all indicate that the trails are easy, but I found some parts to be of medium skill so stay within your comfort zone.I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at the top.

So if you get a standing spot hear the perimeter (not in front of a window), you will have the best unobstructed view during the ascent/descent. The cable care makes a complete 360 degree rotation during the ascent/descent, but bear in mind that a some points during this ride, you will be facing cables or the shear mountain side.The ride is very swift (2-3 minutes), and very steep, which adds to your exhilaration. If you miss some photo ops on the way up, you will get even better views on the Table Mountain walks."

The queues for non ticket holders was almost an hour wait and we actually booked ours while we were waiting in line using our mobile phone.There was the usual rush to get the best view and I loved the fact that the floor rotates so everybody in the car gets a great view and it is not just blocked by a few. The views from the top are just amazing, what a spectacular place and as it was so clear we could see for miles. It was probably a bit more commercial than I would have liked with souvenir shops and a cafe but I would really recommend this attraction and it's not expensive. The only downside is the chaos to get back down. No queues and lots of pushing and shoving to get to the front. Quite frightening when you have small children and should be better managed."

So you get the full 360 experience on the way up (and down). The cars can take a good number of people and I wouldn't have liked to be in a full one (so again glad we got there early).There're plenty of walks and excellent viewpoints at the top and it is possible to steer away from crowds.We were lucky we went when we did, as the cablecars are at the mercy of both the wind and low cloud covering the top.

In spring and wintertime, the light is the best in the morning.

Purchasing the ticket before hand meant that we only had a 20 minute wait and the whole queuing procedure is very cleverly organised.

However it was too windy in the morning and they cable car was close. We drove to other sight-seeing attractions close by and came back in the afternoon. It was open and we did not have to wait for long. The cable car is quite big. It probably takes more than 30 people? (I'm not sure, just assuming from what I saw.) Therefore it was very stable, unlike my other cable car experiences in other countries. The view was just spectacular. We enjoyed it very much and this is definitely a must-do activity in Cape Town! ** A little hiccup during the waiting queue after we bought the tickets and went upstairs, out of the elevator, a staff told my husband and I to go to the right entrance where no one was standing. When my family did move over there, there was another staff talking to us NOT in a nice tone, saying \"this entrance is not open. You need to queue back there.\" We explained to him it was his colleague who told us to come here and he insisted us go back there, still in bad manners. OK, we get it! But don't we deserve an apology? We didn't mess up the queue. We were told to go there!"

Be aware that the cable car shuts down when there is too much fog/clouds or too windy. This happens frequently enough that you need to do some planning if you can. Parking is always an issue too so be prepared to walk a lot. While it is an amazing view from the top (and on the way up and down) it is not as stunning as Cape Point. If you only have a half day, go to the Point instead. If you have a couple of days go to Cape Point first if it is windy in Cape Town. If the weather is great in Cape Town, do the cableway first."

Simple and quick to reach the top, I advise to pre book tickets to beat the queues. We took a taxi from green market square Cape Town, a short 10 mins to the cable car for very little money. You have to plan ahead and keep an eye on the weather as it moves very quickly over the mountain. It can be cold and windy even on a very hot day in town but still comfortable. To witness these views and watch the cloud 'table cloth' spill over the mountain is a memory that will last forever."

We visited yesterday (22 Feb 2016) with family from USA (New York) & Poland after 10 years.Initially we were amazed that there were only 3 parking bays for the disabled and all taken. So I dropped everybody off and drove 2 km to find \"legal\" parking.When we got back the family had not moved in the queue for ages but people that had pre - booked were going through quickly. Everybody else seemed to be waiting. We then decided to book on line whilst in the non-moving queue. This we eventually managed to do. I then went to a very helpful lady (Nazeem --I think, humble apologies for not remembering her name accurately) and told her about my family member who was disabled, that was taking strain. She spoke to someone, who authorized all 8 of us to take a lift to the 5th Floor to get in the cable car together as a family. We were so relieved that we did not have to wait in the long queue and I can only say that from then on it was an absolute pleasure. All the staff were helpful, even at the well stocked/pleasant/efficient restaurant. The only area I think needs urgent attention is the parking, although its 1000 times better than Signal Hill (that's an absolute disaster, especially at sunset - not a policeman or traffic cop in sight to control illegal parking)Maybe a stop and go facility at the Table Mountain Cableway (reasonably priced) would do the trick! Thank You and well done to all."

(When Table mountain has its 'tablecloth' of cloud on, there would be little point in the journey anyway) Good views from the top of the mountain. Coffee/gift shop and restaurant at the top too."

Do check the website (book tickets in advance) for the weather conditions in advance of traveling to the cable car station. Even on a nice sunny day the cable car can be affected by high-winds (which may seem like nothing more than a light breeze in the city). To go to Cape Town and not experience Table Mountain would be very disappointing so to check in advance and ensure you get to experience it is important."

I must say that even though I had to wait in line, the line was efficient and water/drinks/snacks were for sale in the line. Once you get in the cable car, it's pretty crowded. The car rotates, so you get plenty of views as you go up the mountain. The line to come down was not as efficient. People were pretty pushy when it came to getting into the car and it was more crowded than gong up. Still, I'd rather wait in line to ride down than have to brave the sun on a hike up or down the mountain."

The table mountain stop was a highlight- the cable car was a tiny bit scary but the whole experience provided wonderful views of the city and the ocean! The restaurant on top is busy but a good place to grab a bite or a drink. One can take a nice walk around the periphery and get a range of views from the various sides. A must see for the casual visitors!"

We do get a fair amount of wind in Cape Town, meaning that there will be long queues on the first nice day after the wind dies down. However, you can book tickets online. We opted to do the \"sunset special\" ie. tickets are half-Price after 6pm (promotion is still on till Feb. 29th). The ride in the cable car takes about 5 mins and as it rotates you get a great view of the surrounding area. Watching the sunset on top of Table Mountain is such an awesome experience!"

We weren't sure until the last minute whether the weather would permit us to do it. Fortunately, the weather permitted. I've ridden on cable cars in several locations around the world, but this was the most interesting I've experienced. The mountain is practically a vertical ascent. The cars have both a close up view of the strata of rocks and as you ascend and descend, an ever changing view of Capetown and its harbor. Each car rotates while it travels up and down the mountain. For most travelers, a trip to Capetown is a \"bucket list\" experience. So while you're here, be sure to go for the Table Mountain Cableway ride."

We stayed to the center of the car and we all had a nice ride up and down. The walk at the top is more than I had expected it to be, but we were not prepared. It was a very hot and sunny day and we should have brought waters and sun shade if we had time to completely explore the peak. But, as it was, we could only stay 1/2 hour. That amount of time gave us the opportunity to appreciate the view, take in the geology, and flora and fauna of table mountain. For us, these were not to be missed. A recommendation for travelers: the earlier you visit, the shorter the lines. There are strict rules regarding the wind speeds, too, so the cableway may not be running for a few days. The morning after a big wind means even longer lines!"

A wonderful surprise when the rotating floor afforded all passengers great views. A few took to the centre to avoid the rotation. Within minutes we were atop, exiting, finding the flagstone cemented walkways and in clockwise search of the vista views. Breathtaking in awe we found a young couple, nestled on blanket and in party hats to a Birthday, what a neat setting, sunshine and a view that went to the horizon.We took the circular loop in awe of the plants and birds and wonder on the many trails around this mountain. A cool breeze was a pleasant relief from the seaside heat.Once back at the base we soon realized the tingling to our skin in failing to uv protect.

Fortunately, our hotel recommended that we buy our tickets on the website in advance, which saved us a ton of time. If you don't have advance tickets, first you must wait in line to buy tickets, and then you have to wait in the general line to go up. Also, there is an estimated wait time on the Cableway's website, which allowed us to try and visit during the least crowded time. I believe it also states whether the cableway is operating, since it can be closed during high winds.The line at the bottom had lots of umbrellas and canopies providing shade, but when we were waiting at the top to return there were only a few umbrellas spaced out along the line. So, I would recommend bringing a small umbrella to give yourself some shade if you're visiting during a busy time and will have to wait on the way down."

Other people who didn't book early tickets had also arrived but had to wait even if they were in front of us. The cable car is great. It takes about 15 minutes to go up and as long as you are near a window you get a 360 degree view on the way up as the cable car rotates around.

The cabin rotates 360 degrees so you get views of all sides on the way up and down. What a view from the top. All i would say is check the weather before you go as we got a lovely clear day, later in the week, the clouds came over and it was a bit misty. We spent a couple of hours at the top, walking around, they have rough paths along the top of the mountain which was a nice way to spend more time rather than just looking at the views and going back down."

We tried to book online whilst in the queue but the WiFi is woefully inadequate to cope and the App you have to download to get the tickets seemed very flaky and kept failing, probably due to the numbers of people trying to access it. Once you have your ticket you have to join another queue for the actual cable car, so you have been warned, book your tickets ahead of your visit. Booking ahead is the first major complication because Table mountain can adopt it's iconic tablecloth at a moments notice, so trips up the cable way can be cancelled at any time so check the weather before trying to book your tickets and cross your fingers. It is worth the trip though, the views are amazing and the air is much cooler up there. The restaurant is very clean and modern BUT is a bit of a bun fight - the food area is too constricted for the amount of people trying to get food and too dark then there seems not enough tables once you do have food - we were so appalled by the whole scene we bypassed it and went down to find somewhere to eat. Well worth Table mountain is a must do in Cape Town but allow three to four hours to get up, around, and down and take water and sunscreen if only for for the queues!"

The ride to the top is exhilirating and the car rotates through 360 degrees giving nice views on the way up. This is just the start, you are now in National Park, and nearly all walking is easy on the mountain plateau. Plenty of beautiful native flowers to photograph, also sunbirds, and Dassie's ( Rock Hyrax ) outstanding views of craggy cliffs, and views to out to sea over Cape Town. There are nice clean toilet facilities and a restaurant on top, i found it easy to put in 3-4 hours up there. Down side, the queues can be enormous to reach the cable car, it took me 1-1/4 hours to get up there one morning, and when i came down 4 hours later, the queue was longer than in the morning. The cable only runs when weather conditions are suitable, but they have a very good website, letting you know current conditions.

The locals told me that there were unprecedented numbers ther that day, which accounted for the queues of two hours for the ascent and one and a half hours for the descent. At least by having an advance ticket I was able to reduce the former queue to an hour and a half. In the heat that day it was a bonus not to be sneered at!Despite the huge numbers, I was impressed by the speed with which the staff loaded and unloaded the cable car with minimum fuss. The views on top of the mountain were spectacular. Even in these gruelling conditions the waiting time was worthwhile."

The pipe trek path gives the best view of camps bay on your right and the lion's head on your back. After about an hour, slow due to wonderful sightings, we took the left path known as kasteelspoort route. The path is rockey and going up up up... crawling on the boulders which stands almost 90 degree. On the way could able to observed the steel tracks which are being used to carry the boulders at the top for building the water resourver. After one and half hour of hard hiking we reached a plane land where a mountain hut was observed, with permission one can stay there. After this point trek was comfortable but three to four times climbing up the hill and down the hill. In this stretch there are three steel stair case have been placed at three different huge boulders for climbing. Another one and half hour we are at the top of table mountain.

Locals, on the week of their birthday, get a free trip up and down, just show your SA green ID book or ID card. Views are spectacular from the top.

Especially the return trip as there is no cover until the 'station'. Probably 2 hours each way.I ignored the advice on one site to delay the trip until afternoon. Stupid. Also I drove to Table Mountain via the road from the city which added another 45 minutes to the experience. The longer route via Camps Bay has to be better, if that's an option. Thankfully I had bought a ticket, online, in advance or I would have been turned away, such was the popularity. I acknowledge my visit was during the peak holiday week (December 30) but other sunny days are also bad, I was told. After those negatives, I have to say that the cable car experience itself was great. Wonderful views and the 360 rotating platform is a tremendous initiative."

It may seem like there are a lot of people when you are in line, and in the cable car, but once on top, everyone spreads out and wanders - it is a lovely flat hike with incredible views. Wonderful for all ages and abilities. Not only are there views, but interesting foliage, plants and flowers are growing up there. I have been there when it is clear, and when the clouds are rolling in - both are incredible. Note that there are restrooms there, as well as a nice restaurant where you can take away snacks and drinks, or sit down for tea or a glass of wine. The views are exceptional - not to be missed.

There is no car park so get your spot on the approach road where you can and pay the \u2018guard\u2019 when you leave. To get the best spot (it is a steep long road especially on a hot day) go right to the top and turn back at the roundabout and take the first spot you can. Alternatively come on the hop-on sightseeing bus. You MUST buy a ticket in advance (on line ticket valid for 7 days from date of your choice, or on the sightseeing bus) as the queue for tickets can be over an hour on top of the queue for the cable car (we waited 45 mins+). Go in the morning when you can see it is clear. I think it often gets worse during the day and rarely gets better. Wear stout shoes as the paths at the top soon decay into rocky walks. All well maintained but not smooth. Disabled access good for the first part of the paths at the top so worth going. The cable car rotates as it goes up so no need to try to grab a good spot. They are all good! There are no barriers to falling off the edge of the mountain, so parental control and self-control is the order of the day. Walking up and/or down is only for the really fit. Food at the top is decently priced and decently good albeit in a busy place. There is a new system now for booking a place in the inevitable queue to get back down. The system will have evolved. We were there on its first day (2 days before Christmas can you believe!). Take a timed ticket from the machine (your choice of time) as soon as you leave the upward cable car terminus. The queue to go down equals the one to go up and this ticket enables you to have a walk/coffee/comfort break instead of wasting an hour in a queue!"

The breathtaking views from the top are well documented, another major plus for me was doing the cablecar and seeing the shales of rock up the mountain almost perfectly level...amazing. The car rotates which is a good feature, though the grubby windows in places can spoil an otherwise perfect picture.The downside though are the massive queues for the cablecar. They say go early but unless you are there at least before 8am or even earlier it is not worth going 'early'. We took one of the first City Sightseeing buses on 30 December and were in line around 9.45am (later than expected due to queuing traffic on the aporoach to the mountain) and got through about 11.15am. Queues were much shorter at the bottom when we returned about 3pm, though it was hotter. Note that there is only shade for so long in the queue (we had shade for about an hour), so bring adequate protection, I wish we had brought an umbrella, as it was a 30 degree day.The killer though is the queue to come down which is almost entirely unshaded, apart from close to the car which is a crowded room without air con. So despite precautions we still got sunburnt. I feel the customer experience here could certainly be improved - namely air con inside and some further shaded areas for the queue.There are also long queues for the cafe and restaurant at the top. We got fed up with the restaurant queue so tried the cafe but they had already run out of sandwiches and wraps by at least 12.30pm.Better to try on a day when it is less hot, ideally February onwards and outside of holiday periods, if you can."

Saves time as there are always queues. We arrived at 8 am and had to park quite away below ( about a 10 min walk up hill) we then had an hr wait in the pre booked line. The other was even longer. When you pre pay on line I think the tickets are valid for a few days in case the weather suddenly changes. Take binoculars as well as cameras as the views are amazing. There is now a cafe bar/ restaurant at the top which wasn't there before. A must visit when visiting Capetown"

Tickets are available in many places and online but be careful; the high winds that affect Capetown on a regular basis often cause the cable car to shut down suddenly, for unpredictable periods making planning difficult. The car is fairly unique in that it rotates during the trip; no matter where you stand you get to see everything, Capetown or the dramatic cliffs. The top of the volcanic hill has outstanding views of the city and the coast. There is an excellent restaurant on top. The top is quite barren with abundant fauna and flora. Dress warmly, the strong winds at the top can make the temperature much cooler. Be prepared for lines at the base and for the return coming down."

Study weather and seize the day when it's in your favor. Get your tickets online -- if you're my kind of tourist there will be a line for the tram (mostly shaded) when you get there at 11:00 am, and you don't want to do two lines. If you head for the eight o'clock opening or even something sort of early you could avoid queueing and of course we know about all the nice worms available for early birds. Better yet, the late (sunset) runs are reduced price, and probably less crowded but of course risk of cloud may go up. If you want help or information from a person as well as the handy cell phone app available for free, pick up a guide (green shirts.) Theoretically these give free tours on the hour, but go up to one at any old time and you will find there is no charge; your gratuity is his or her salary, but mine earned it with plenty of information, key views, and a walk exactly tailored to my physical limits in time and effort. The facilities at top and bottom are top-notch -- visited Whistler in British Columbia five months earlier and these are every bit as well-built and well run, with a lot more lore and history (no insult intended, O Canada!) The cafeteria can get crowded but the food seems fine and covers a family-friendly middle ground. Table Mountain is a favorite outing for locals as well as tourists, and you'll find whole families from every one of South Africa's nations spending the day. Also a treat."

We went up to enjoy the sunset and were not disappointed...views of the city/Robben Island/Camp's Bay, were unbelievable. I preferred the hikes (Lion's Head hike @ sunset or actually hiking up Table Mtn), however if with any less mobile travel companions I highly recommend this route up the mountain. I recommend calling beforehand to make sure that the cablecar is running (often stops due to winds), and also that it will remain open for you to get back down! Also, we brought our own snacks/drinks which turned out to be a good call since cafe at the top of cablecar is very expensive."

Up we went... A rotating cable car so that everyone gets to see the views. Once up at the top there are plenty of places to take photos with amazing views. We grabbed a bite to eat in the restaurant before we started off on our walk. IMPORTANT - make sure you take plenty of water and sun cream. We didn't have enough water and there is nowhere to buy any except from the shop at the top. We walked for about 3 hours (approx 7km) stopping for photos. When we got back there were a lot of people so best advice is to get up there early! A great morning and we were lucky because the weather the next couple of days wasn't very good for going up table mountain so get up there as soon as you can!! ;-)"

Our group had a tour guide and a driver which I recommend as they close the mountain to traffic when it gets too full, parking is limited, and we saw a lot of people walking a loooong way to get there. We also got there pretty early (by 9 am), which was good because shortly after cars were turned away. When we got there we found out we could have purchased tickets ahead of time online which would have made things easier and cut out 2 hours of waiting. You can purchase beer and food at the top too!

They're refundable if you don't use them. It's definitely worth paying extra and going to the 7:30 session. Our first try we went in the afternoon. Just as we got there they closed the cable car. I heard one lady complaining she'd been waiting over an hour. The traffic going back down the hill was horrendous and not moving. We walked down but if you had a car up there you were stuck. Our second attempt was at 7:30am the next day. We were put in an express queue to go up first so not only do you not have to wait in a queue we also missed all the crowds up the top. Once there the effort is definitely worth it. Just stunning! You can walk along the various routes so give yourself plenty of time.

For South Africans, it's free to go up on your birthday.. be sure to have your i.d. with you to prove it though. It's also free to children under 4, so taking my 3 year old son up for his 3rd birthday was cool (his request, not mine)The best viewing time is to go about 2 hours before sunset (during September 2015, it took us 2 hours standing in a queue to get up, and almost the same amount of time to get down, and only about 30 minutes at the top). Go at this time so you can experience daylight, golden hour (my favourite), and the amazing night lights that you can see across the city.Also book online in advance on the Webtickets site, so you can avoid at least 1 extra queue, and you can even scan in the barcode from the phone at the entrance to the cableway, no printing necessary (just make sure your phone has enough juice). Make sure your cameras are fully charged and have plenty of space on your memory card, because you'll want to snap the amazing sights at the top and the bottom of the mountain. When we went, it was a wind-free day and there was a 40-something year old guy showing off by flying his drone all over the place.. I don't think that's responsible or should be allowed either way though.. and he eventually crashed it somewhere and damaged the propeller.Be very careful with your young ones though.. it's possible for them to run right off the mountain in some parts. I still don't get why some people insist on taking dangerous photos while standing at the edge.Also be careful on the cable car itself.. if you're tall, and holding a child or baby, then stand as close to the centre as possible to avoid dropping them over the rail! (I was surprised that there was no previous warning about this)The cable car floor rotates to give you epic 360 degree views, so you literally have nowhere to balance or hold on to when you're going up or down the mountain.. be careful. Apparently you can also hike up and take the cable car down at half the price (it's about 2 hours of hiking for the average joe).. maybe I'll do that one day.There's also abseiling options available at the top (maybe I'll also do that one day), as well as a gift shop, a mini restaurant/coffee shop, and a loo at the top and the bottom of the cable car areas.There's also free guided tours every hour or so, on the hour.. just be at the assembly point in time.. was sad I missed it"

The ride up by revolving cable car is quite an experience, but not for those having a fear of heights! Once up the walking around is easy and there are many paths and interesting vegetation to explore.

The lines took us an hour to get through, but then we were on our way. Stunning views from a dizzying height definitely comes to mind. The trails were reasonably flat and accommodating to even the most laxed walker. We stayed until 8pm to see the sun set and man was it worth it.

Unlike others we decided not to hike it and took the cable car instead. Positives: The cable cars have rotating floors as you ascend/descend so even if you are last to board your car, you still get a 360 view on the way up/down. Amazing view of Cape Town, if you go towards the back you also gets view of both the Indian and Atlantic Ocean. It was very busy on the day, so we were worried that it would be cramped at the top. There was no need to worry as there is plenty of space to walk around and take photos. Very friendly staff. Negatives: there was over crowding when you got out of the lifts upstairs to get on the cable car. As a result, people could queue jump/push in front of you. Top tip: make sure you buy your tickets online beforehand as you save a lot of time in the queues on the day. Also, tickets are valid for 7 days from purchase so if you're staying for a few days in Cape Town, book your cable car tickets for the first day and will still have 7 days to use if the weather isn't on your side.

This is a top Cape Town sight, and well worth it. The first time I was in Cape Town I walked up a path to the east of the lower cable station and then took the first cable down. Sunrise on the top of the mountain (with nobody around) is spectacular and much recommended. Do this if you can, if not, be sure to book in advance (the tickets are valid for 7 days) to avoid queuing for the ticket office. You will have to queue for the cable but even during holiday season this was fairly quick.Allow at least 2 hours at the top to walk around the summit and eat/drink in the cafe. The cafe at the top is fairly good but it will get crowded so you may want to bring your own food if you need to eat. There is an flat and even path around the summit and plenty of good photo opportunities. You park on the road by the lower cable station then walk to the station - there is plenty of parking, which is free. The most important consideration is probably the weather. You do not want to go up if it is very windy (eventually they close the cable) or cloudy at the top. Even in the middle of summer cloud can form on the summit as the moist air is pushed up by the mountain. Look online at the weather forecast before you head out to go to the top.i"

As a result we were spared the awful queues, we were able to park close by and were able to leave at the end of our visit without any difficulty. The cafe at the top is a good spot to have a bite or a drink whilst you decide which paths to take. The paths are well-marked and there is no shortage of routes and things to see. The views are obviously spectacular and worth seeing, but the landscape at the top, the flora and fauna are worth the visit too. We can highly recommend the online booking to save a lot of queuing time."

It is a tough walk but lots of fun and add some spice to your visit.The mountain itself is magnificent and offers some beautiful views, great for picture taking.We didn't encounter any crowds whatsoever which was quite lucky.Walk to the lighthouse for the most spectacular views.This is a stop not to be missed while you are in Capetown.Enjoy you walk down!"

This was really easy to do and offered us the flexibility (ticket valid for 7 days) to go up the mountain when the weather was perfect. We bought one way tickets which also meant we didn't need to commit to timing.We arrived in Cape Town just as it stopped raining and noted the clouds lifting as the day progressed. We checked the website and wait time was listed as 5 mins and visibility was noted as good so we drove ourselves to the cable car station. We were really lucky and parked on the side of the road right near the station. There was no queue (3pm) so went straight up the mountain.On the cable car try and stand near the edge. The floor rotates once 360 degrees during the 3 minute trip up the mountain so you get great views regardless of where you stand.On top there are various timed walks marked out. The views are stunning, the information boards informative and the vegetation very different.I would highly recommend this as something you do near near the start of your holiday as long as the visibility is good. It gives you great perspective on Cape Town."

My only problem with the cableway is when you enter and everyone is all tucked in for the ride up it's fine, but the minute the door closes and you start moving you have this moving floor that moves clockwise in order for you to get a 360 view of the amazing scenery, BUT not everybody appreciates this so what I experienced was a load of rude people that wanted to climb over me to get the next best pic of the same thing. To avoid this sit ya self in the middle of the car that has fixed seating and doesn't move, I figured this out on the way down. At the top of Table Mountain there are lots of great trails to walk and views to experience, as aggravating as the cableway was its well worth the visit. Hope this helps, enjoy."

Every one started lining up to buy jackets at 4 times the price The sales assistant on top in the shop closest to the docking point is the least service oriented person ever she was so upset to sell anything if it wasn't for the fact that it was freezing I am sure most of the clientele would have left. So be warned take a jacket or face the wrath of the unwilling angry shop assistant. We finished the walk on the top and the decided to have breakfast in the only eating place. This is a buffet. You choose what you want then it get weighed let me tell you if service is bad food is worse Which is a pity as all the ingredients for an excellent meal is there There is a lack of training or maybe a like it or lump it attitude that says don't eat on the mountain.

This is not quite to the Cape of Good Hope -- the Cape is still further south, so you don't see the Indian Ocean. But, you might see water that recently has been in the Indian Ocean. Take care to go when the weather's good and not wait for another day, as the clouds often obscure the view and they close the place on cloudy days.

Book tickets ahead - even on the morning of your visit to avoid the ticket queue - then you just have to queue for the cable car. Book on line or buy a ticket on the Big Red Bus, which is as good a way as any to get there. It's also worth noting that the queues are worse after a day when weather prevents the cable car running.

I had been waiting several days for the weather to clear and for the cable car to operate. On arrival I found that one had a join a queue for those without tickets and it took 90 minutes to get to the ticket office. Once getting the ticket I then had to queue for a further 30 minutes to actually get on to the cable car which was surprisingly fast. Its 360 degree rotating view was excellent, especially as the car was crammed with 60+ people.The journey back required a 30 minute wait to get on the cable car, so that meant I had to shorten the time I had hoped to spend at the top. I had joined a guided tour which was very interesting, but I had no time to walk further on the pathways around the mountain as one had to spend so much time waiting. There is no obvious solution to the problem, but one option would be to buy one's ticket in advance and perhaps go later in the day and take a risk with the vagaries of the weather.The scenery is amazing and worth the wait. Take a book to read in the queue!+"

It's easily accessible by the tourist bus which stops at the cable car station or by taxi from the city. Keep an eye on the weather as the sun doesn't always shine and when it does the winds can pick up closing the cable car, so if the weather is good go for it and find something else to do when the clouds descend. I would also recommend getting your cable car tickets at the tourist bus stops (either by the V & A or on Long Street) as this will stop you having to cue up twice (once to by the tickets, once to ride the cable car) you'll still have to do it once though!Once at the top there are a number of self guided routes that will take you around the top from a short 10 mins to about an hour long route. There is also a restaurant and reasonably priced bar at the top to enjoy a beer while taking in the views."

I would like to think I don't have real heigh issues, but when you see this cableway as a dot in the sky from below, I should be excused if my stomach lurches a bit. We hiked up the mountain using Patteklip Gorge route and took the cableway down. The line up at 10am on a sunny day to go up alone would have made me hike of we weren't planning to already. It was ridiculously long. Be warned. I got one-way tickets at the top and the line to come down around 3pm was very short so this worked out. The cableway rotates as you go down and up so you can't hold on to the sides. It's a strange sensation to be rotating and going downhill, but that is quickly forgotten as you start to look at the views and prepare for when the open window section of the car gets to where you are standing to take a photo. It was over before I could even comprehend the rotation aspect A worthwhile experience."

We booked a 1 day city sightseeing tour and hence bought tickets with them in advance. We took the cable up there so go there quicker. The views are breath taking. My only suggestion is to try and find out what the weather may look like the day you go as sometimes it's nice and sunny and the other days there was a big mist covering the mountain so you won't have a nice view. Otherwise there are plenty of spots up the mountain that you can visit and even have a personal time with your partner and just sit quietly and on your own and enjoy the view. There is space for everyone to have their own private moments without having ppl always coming by you and taking pictures the whole time!

If it is closed due to bad weather check back periodically as the weather can change drastically very quickly. There are many walking trails up the mountain, the lower mountain isn't very difficult for those in decent shape but the higher regions have pathways literally hanging off mountain sides. If you are planning to hike up I would suggest taking the Cableway first to assess the situation. Trails have varying degrees of difficulty so do your research. Should you be on top of the mountain when the Cableway closes, you either wait for it to reopen or walk down. There are two cable cars that revolve when going up and down so any spot by the window is a good one. Long lines are the norm, get there early to beat the worst of the crowds if possible. Wait time can be about 30-60 minutes, ride itself is about 10 minutes to the top. There are trails on top of the mountain and abseiling for the fearless (rapelling). The weather was clear but cold so dress warmly. There is a gift shop and restaurant there as well. On clear days amazing views of Capetown, Robben Island and the surrounding area."

I took the latter and arrived fifteen minutes before opening on a Saturday at 7.45am. There were already cars parked all along the edge of the road up to the cableway base station and I waited about 25 mins for tickets. The queue to then get to the top took another 40 mins. There was a separate queue for those with tickets which was much longer and comprised of many coach parties. I don't think it was much different time-wise. The view is great and the cable car rotates during the very quick journey. Don't lose your ticket or you'll be walking down - this seems to be a silly rule. Offering free rides down would encourage more people to hike up which is a good thing (but obviously bad for business!)."

There are stairs and an elevator to get you to the platform to board. the cable car/ box itself takes about 64 people and has a revolving floor giving 360 degree views on your way up and down. to add to the exhilarating ride 2 side of the car are open and if standing at the edge the blast of cool mountain air will wake you.A great way to get to the top. There are souvenir shops at the top and base."

We did.The car slowly spins as it brings you up and as it brings you down. This allows you an amazing view, no matter where in the cable car you stand. And the spin is slow enough that there is no feeling of vertigo or motion sickness.We bought our tickets online ahead of time, and wow are we glad we did. The line to get tickets was enormous. It took us about 30 minutes after arrival to get to the top of Table Mountain. And only 4 minutes of that was in the cable car itself. But that was nothing compared to the people who had to buy tickets. They must have been there for hours.There is a cafe and a gift shop at the top. The food is terribly overpriced, but good."

Take money or your visa card with to the mountain as their is a nice restaurant where you can relax. I prefer a picnic basket as it is just so much more romantic and the kids also love the idea of a picnic on the mountain.Do not forget your camera!!! Its essential to bring back up batteries.Only downside for me was the toilet facilites. There is a \"smell\" haning in the air close to the toilets, but due to the location there is no other way to do the toilets i assume.... so only go there if you NEED TO.Whenever you come to Cape Town, you MUST visit our beautiful mountain. Please leave your cellphone on silent. It is really a wonderful, relaxed, calm atmosphere. It is not nice hearing 20 different lanuages all on their cellphones having conversations....be there to have family time or romantic time with loved ones. Welcome to Cape Town!"

Not sure what parking would be like.... I went early in the morning and was there before 9am. The queue was already growing fast by that time and by 9:30 was easily looking like a 2 hour wait. In the end even with the prepaid ticket it took me 1.5 hours to get up. Depending on when you go it might be best not to prepay. The queue for that was shorter and you don't have to queue twice. If doing it again i'd take a taxi to be there for when they open if i didn't have a ticket and would head there half an hour earlier if I had a prepaid ticket.. That way this amazing trip would take up so much time. The ride itself is well organised and swift and the views from the top and definitely worth the wait. At the top there is a restaurant and gift shop too. If you chose to walk up I'm told by a (fit) friend that it took him around 2hrs.

Although it was busy, the queue moved quickly and soon we were airborne! It's a short ride up and you are on a rotating floor so everyone gets a chance at a view (unless you are very short and standing in the middle). The way the cableway was built into a cleft at the top of Table Mountain is a little scary but when you emerge you forget about that part. The top is quite extensive if you walk all the way around and great views over Cape Town and the bay beyond.

I'd recommend standing by the open air section without windows because the view is that much more spectacular without scuffed up glass.

Good idea at the time, I mean how hard can it be? As it turned out, very! The weather is crucial to the experience but It changes constantly and so I think you have to just go and at some stage the clouds dissapear for a remarkable vista of capetown and surrounds. The walk down was a great experience but you may not have thigh muscles for a few days after! We took no food or water which was dumb in retrospect but luckily a couple of mountain streams proved very welcome to rehydrate at intervals along the way. A pizza and beer on the summit were very nice. This day was an unforgettable fun day that should not be missed if in capetown."

The views from the top are beautiful. The cable car rotates giving you an all around view. However, before you realize you have reached your destination, either up or down. It must be one of the shortest cable car rides I have taken. I have hiked up the mountain several times, but have never hiked down thanks to this cable car. I have seen long lines to catch the cable car at times, but this time when we did decide to take it up & down on a Monday we were lucky because it was not busy at all.They don't operate the cable car on windy days and even when you have gone up with it in the morning, weather can suddenly change and they can decide to shut it down. The signs on the top say that they have an alarm system that alerts people to quickly come back to the cable car if this happens. Luckily it has never happened to us. However, it is worth your while to study the weather conditions when you dare to go up, especially if you have difficulty hiking down the mountain."

The views are spectacular and the walks on the top interesting and manageable. But there are a few things that you need to be prepared for- weather is a big factor - low clouds or winds are not uncommon and the mountain will close - keep an eye on the forecasts- Be prepared to queue. I went off-peak season (October), and had to wait for 45 minutes from joining the queue to getting into a cablecar. And, once in the queue, there's no going back - difficult for young kids to understand- If you haven't got a ticket, you have a seperate queue to join before you get to the main one - so, if possible, buy your ticket in advance (I believe the circle tour bus terminuses sell them, amongst others)- The cable cars revolve - but they pack them full. So, if you don't get to a window asap you'll not see too much from the centre of the car, as people at the windows don't move. A tip. When in the cable car station, go straight to the door where your cable car entry will be and stand by it. Most people don't do this until they see their car coming towards them. This will put you near the front of the queue & in prime position to bag a window. (If you do't get one, don't worry - the views from the top are better)"

If not you drive to as near to the cable car station as possible and then try and find a parking space on the road, much less hassle using the park and ride.We had to queue for around two hours, but the time passed quickly and it's all well controlled and no-one jumps the queue. However, if you are smarter then we were, buy an advance ticket online, you then jump the queue.The ride up is spectacular, and when boarding the car everyone wants to be near the open window, don't worry if your not, as the inside of the car revolves slowly as it ascends so everyone gets a turn.The views from the top are simply amazing, it was worth the two hour queue. There are well maintain footpaths to explore the top of the Table Mtn, and people stick to the paths so as not to damage the beautiful flora. Look out for Dassies (Rock Hyrex), and you should see eagles or buzzards above.There is a good, but very busy caf\u00e9, easier to take a picnic.The ride down is even more spectacular, as the cable car station is on the edge of a precipice, and it just launches into space and it's very steep.If you visit Cape Town, this is a must."

If we had known it would take this long, we would have done it another day. After 90 mins we were told they were running the cars at half speed and half capacity and that is why it was taking so long. This was a safety precaution due to the wind. When we eventually made it in to the cable car we had an amazing ride with spectacular views. The views from the top were well worth the wait, but my goodness it was windy!!! We had to cling on to everything! After about 30 mins the sirens rang alerting us to the need to return down as the cars would be closing due to high winds. Again we queued! About 45 mins this time. We made it down safely and overall felt it was worth the hassle, but I think we would have had a better experience if it hadn't been so windy and we had been updated earlier.

We had to queue for an hour, but there was lots of shade provided, as well as cooling mist which was very much appreciated ! If you bought tickets online then there was a shorter \"queue jumping queue\" which would have halved our wait (oh well, next time !)The ride up was so smooth and the car rotated giving everyone a changing view as we ascended. Amazing to spot all the mountain climbers and rock climbers scaling these heights. At the top we did the short circular walk, which gave us an opportunity to appreciate the cliffs, valleys and vistas in all directions. There are longer walks available to do, as well as ways to climb down on foot. There is a cafe and shop up here, as well as toilets etc. All in all we spent an hour taking in all the views. There was a short wait to come down (5 min at the most).When we got to the bottom we discovered that there were no queues ! Clearly morning are peak times, so best avoid. The cableway website was very helpful with weather conditions and expected waiting times, both were very accurate. The Hop On Hop Off bus offers a combination ticket, and these will let you jump the queue.Table mountain has been voted one of the \"New 7 Wonders\" of the world, and it absolutely deserves this title !"

I went just when they opened at 8:30 am and the lines moved pretty quickly. I was up on top by 9:30. I had to be back in my hotel for a meeting at 10:30 so my stay at the top was short but spectacular. I got to see some beautiful flowers and very cute local rodents called Dassies sunning themselves on the rocks. The views are amazing--ocean or mountains in every direction. Definitely worth the trip to the top, even if you only have a bit of time. I would love to come back and hike around on the mountain."

We visited Table Mountain on a beautiful Sunday afternoon so the cableway was obviously very busy. Despite this, the queue was fast-moving and we got to the top of the mountain quite quickly. The ride up the mountain is fun, the rotating cablecars allowing every passenger to get a good 360\u00b0 view.Once we got to the top, I was amazed at the view - it is really splendid. There are some nice walks on the mountain top as well as a restaurant, souvenir shop etc.We watched the sun set over the sea and when we decided to join the queue to travel back down, about 20 minutes before the last cable car was scheduled, we found the queue to be very long but expected it to move quickly as it had on the way up.I am not sure if the cablecars were going slower than usual of it simply too many people were allowed up during the afternoon, but the fact is that the queue was extremely slow and it took us over one hour and a half to be able to travel back down. This hour and a half was spent in the dark, with the chill of the night and the wind (we were cold despite our jackets but some people were in shorts and tshirts and must have been freezing). People with children or elderly people were given priority, which is good, but the situation seemed really out of hand. I am not sure if this was a single incident or if it happens regularly, but it seems that there is a great deal of lack of organization regarding the \"quotas\" of people allowed up..."

The other queue where people who had to purchase their tickets was sprayed with light water sprinkle but no joy for us!!the wait was very uncomfortable but staff were very professional. The wait was certainly worth it. It took about 5 mins to ascend in the cable car which rotated constantly ensuring everyone got to see the spectacular views from all angles. When we reached the summit, there were panoramic views of the Cae Town city bowl, harbour and of Robbin Island. There are many gorgeous walks and spectacular flora and fauna. We had lunch in the mountain top restaurant accompanied by a glass of Cape Town's best Sauvignon blanc chilled to perfection. Food was reasonable enough considering this is one of the New Seven wonders of the World!A must do if you are in Cape Town!! It closes very frequently due to wind so go at the earliest opportunity on your holiday."

There are two lines (queues) One for those who have tickets and one for one who don't have tickets. GET YOUR ONLINE TICKETS BEFORE YOU GO!!! Cheaper and you'll save an hour of line waiting. If you don't have tickets you wait in the first line to purchase your tickets, and then you wait in the second line to get on the lift. If you get there by 8:00 you'll beat all the tour buses (read groups of 60 or more) and get on the first couple of cable cars, beating the hordes of people. The first day we went, we had our hotel get our online tickets and print them. We waited in line for 30 minutes and then they closed the car because of high winds. This was at 1:00 in the afternoon. Online tickets are good for 7 days so we were advised to get there early the next day, when winds are usually lower. We go there at 8:00 and were on the first 3 or 4 cars. Right after we got in line FIVE tour buses dropped off their guests, with more on the drive up the road! We did the half hour free guided tour which is given on the hour and it was very enjoyable and informative. Highly recommend that one as well. Then we walked around the top, oooing and aaaahhhing and taking lots of pictures. Enjoyed watching paragliders take off from Lions Head, just to the West of us. We went down around noon, and could have stayed longer but we felt that we had gotten enough of the flavor of Table Mountain to know we could easily come back and we wanted to get down to the Waterfront. See my other review of hiking up."

I was very happy that I had purchased tickets in advance of my visit as the queues were very long and I was able to breeze through with my advance purchase ticket. The cableway is a professionally run operation and allowed for smooth, easy passage up to the top of Table Mountain. Note - the cablecar rotates 360 degrees as it travels up the mountain so you get spectacular views no matter where you stand. The views from the top are spectacular and definitely worth going up for. There is a cafe at the top if you wish to purchase refreshments plus bathroom facilities. Highly recommend this attraction."

This coincided with it being a Friday when pensioners (and I am one) get a special deal on a meal at the top of the mountain. What a treat it turned out to be. The staff of the cableway went out of their way to make sure I enjoyed it. They wished me happy birthday all along the line. The food was excellent and on our trip down again, as we left someone on the staff said, \"We hope you have enjoyed your day with us\". And I sure had. The vistas are wonderful, the scenery superb, the flora and fauna exquisite. It's a wonderful world in a rarified atmosphere. Loced every minute."

If it is a rainy day the printed tickets are valid for 7 days from the date you planned to go up! There are two queues - one to buy tickets and one for pre-purchased tickets - they are both long but the one with pre-purchased tickets is the shorter one. We waited about 45-1 hour to get to the top, coming down there were no waits but I have been told by friends they waited for up to 2 hours to go up and come down (both ends - total of 4 hours). It isn't expensive online, from memory it was 300R per person - $30 AUD. The cable car rotates inside slowly and you get a full 360 view - get near the outside to look out the window! The middle part does not rotate so if you get motion sickness you can sit in the middle. The views are absolutely breathtaking! Take a good camera! We also hired a driver for the day, I highly recommend it. She charged 100R from the city to Table Mountain, a little pricey compared to the CITI bus at 30R. There are shops at the bottom and from memory there may be a cafe at the top but it wasn't open so not entirely sure it was."

On your birthday you are also able to ride the Cable Car at a discount.Visit the top of Table Mountain if the weather allows it.

The problem is that the buses arrive one after the other, and these groups are directed to a parallel queue advancing much faster than our own! Actually, these groups are prioritized!! So it will take us more than 1h45 only to buy our tickets! And that's not all: it is then time to another line-up: to board the cable car itself.. another hour lost! Obviously, reached the top at 11:30, the clouds invaded the summit and seen nothing. We descend disappointed. I suggest much more, go to the Signal Hill by car or taxi or hike the Lions Head.

They have a separate line for those who booked online and already have tickets which probably saved over an hour in line so I would recommend that highly. The hotel concierge helped us with the booking. Tickets booked online are valid for not just the day scheduled, but up to 14 days beyond that so you don't have to worry about missing your trip due to fog or wind closing the cableway. The cablecar floor rotates as it goes up and down so everyone has the same view. but that means that you cannot hold onto the railings since the outside of the car does not rotate. Several elderly individuals on my last trip had some difficulty with not being able to hold the railing so they may be better off in the small central area (where the operator stands) which does not rotate. It has a bench on one side for individuals who need to sit down for the trip up or down."

So read the weather forecast and be forewarned that Cape weather can change almost instantly. Anyways we were lucky and id was a clear morning.Once you show your downloaded bar chart in your phone to the entrance, you are on. The lower cable station is on Tafelberg Road. The upper cable station offers views overlooking Cape Town, Table Bay and Robben Island to the north, and the Atlantic seaboard to the west and south.This cable way has officially opened to the public in 1929 and extensively upgraded, In 1997. A car can carry 65 passengers. As one goes up, the other one descends. Don\u2019t worry where you stand, you will get all the view, as the cars rotate through 360 degrees during the ascent or descent, giving you a panoramic view. The ascent is quite steep and if you have a fear of heights you might as well close your eyes in the car\u2026."

There are other ways to get atop Table Mountain (Aka hiking) but can be tiring.Do make sure that you check if the cableway is open before making your way to the base. In times of wind, especially in winters, they close the cableway which happened with us on two occassions. However, if you are patient enough, you will get a chance to use the ride.

After about an hour and a half, and not having got too far in the queue, we realized that those who arrived without a ticket, were being taken to the ticket counter, and then put in at the front of the line, whilst we were kept waiting, with just a few of us at a time progressing for the final queue to the cable car. Very disappointed with the situation, although when we finally made the top after two hours, the view was quite impressive. Restaurant was reasonably well organized, and they have a well supplied gift shop."

But during the spring it can be very windy and they can shut down the Cableway at a moments notice which would mean you have to walk down. The day we went it was windy and so we climbed up and down. Each way takes about an hour. But be warned, it is not a light stroll. One needs to be in decent shape. Definitely not for people not in shape or with health risks. The views from the top are spectacular! Oh yes and it is noticeably colder on top."

The cable car rotates on the way up and down. The one negative is the price to go up. I think its far too expensive, especially for South Africans."

We had to queue almost 2 hours but thought it would be worth it and it certainly was. The cable car is smooth and only takes a few minutes to reach the top.And what an amazing view over Cape Town.There is an excellent cafe at the top and a small gift shop.Keep a check on the weather and if it's a clear day forget what else you had planned,go to the top of this mountain you will not be disappointed."

There was a wait of about an hour to get on, even though we had booked tickets in advance. There are two lines, one for the ticketless and one for pre-booked. Both seemed to move at the same speed and the people who didn't have tickets simply went to the front of the queue after purchasing - so advice to pre-book seemed pointless. It's a nice ride up and down with the cable car rotating in mid air so everyone gets the chance of enjoying the views. We parked at the bottom in the free car park and got the shuttle bus up. They run every 20 mins when we were there late September."

Nevertheless, the views (as expected) are stunning but comes at a high price (R225 per adult).We were planning on spending lunch time on the mountain, but having walked into the overpriced, very stuffed shop, we decided otherwise and returned to ground instead for a sandwich and bottle of water. I'd put aside an hour to enjoy the views. During peak season, the queues are very very long and waiting time may reach 2 to 3 hours. Also, you may have to park down the mountain and walk up so I would rather get a cab to the top to avoid parking hassles. A sunhat and shades are a must (especially if you going to be waiting in the queue). "

The views from the top are always different due to the time of the year and the weather conditions on the day.

The cable car rotates, giving you 360 degree view of the mountain and Cape Town, thereby affording marvelous opportunity for great photography. Be adventurous and take a walk along the paved walkways to make the most of the scenery. Rather than reaching there and being disappointed, always ring first to check if the cable car is running because it does not operate in high winds and rain. There is a restaurant at the top for usual fast food. I must admit I have not used itr except for a drink."

That can be an amazing experience. If you have to go in peak hours, please note that parking is difficult so you may have to park a long a long from the cableway. Take the the free MyCiTi shuttle service from the Lower Tafelberg Road stop, just off Kloof Nek Road, to the Upper Tafelberg Road stop at the Lower Cable station. Alternatively take the red City sightseeing bus. Check out the tablemountain cableway website. It is very helpful .www.tablemountain.net Note that the cableway closes in high wind and is frequently covered in a blanket of cloud.

            "review": "Ingenious Innovation that allows 360 Degree Viewing on the Way Up & Down!. Unless you're a masochist or enjoy climbing mountains, this is the best way to get to the top of Table Mountain and experience its wonderful views.Our tour guide dropped as at the bottom to purchase tickets: he had a season pass which for anyone intending to pay more than one visit to the top, is excellent value. As we got there early, the purchase process was fairly quick, but the queueing facilities that were in place suggest that you can spent a lot of time in the queue for this ... get there early to avoid lengthy delays.There are two carriages, that are circular in design, which enables the most wonderful feature: the floor inside the carriage revolves and means that there really is no bad spot to view the scenery on the way up (or down). The \"driver\" in the carriage warns folks to release their hold on handles and step away from the windows before he activated the rotation mechanism.The trip up/down is only 2-3 minutes in length, but it really shows off the spectacular views of the Cape Town cityscape. As there are two carriages, one will come down at the same time the other ascends ... passing at the halfway point.The ride is smooth and the big windows allow plenty of photography. I've attached some snaps that I took on the way up/down, but don't worry if you aren't able to photograph anything - when you get to the top, astounding views there more than compensate (and you can easily snap away there).For anyone with a fear of heights, stand in the middle near the driver and enjoy the views from a distance ... but the great design of the carriages means that really anyone can enjoy the views.Enjoy!"

I would recommend it. The ride only lasts a couple of minutes but this is one of three such cable cars in the World than revolves slowly as you go up. Although you mainly look through glass there is a section that is open so you can get great photos. It is the floor that turns, not the outside.Of course when you get to the top it us breath taking.Table Mountain has been on our bucket list for years and the experience was enhanced by the super ride up.

And of course the view from the top is a different feeling of excitement, peace and gratitude."

To us, paying so little to experience such a great wonder was fantastic. Getting to the top of the mountain was made even better by the cable car having a rotating disc. So before you arrive at the top, you have had a beautiful 360 degree view of the mountain and Cape Town and its surrounds. Don't be in a hurry. Enjoy the views from every vantage point. Identify landmarks. Take a long walk towards East side of the mountain. Take in the wonderful variety of \"Fynbos\". Join a free guided tour if you want. Just sit somewhere on a rock and admire the fantastic views towards the Atlantic Ocean. Don't skip the gift shop. You will find a great variety of Table Mountain branded products at very reasonable prices. There are many friendly staff members around to help or assist. If you want to make the most of your visit, budget 3-4 hours to ensure you can take it all in. It is truly worth your time. We loved it!"

The views are stunning as you rise from street level to mountaintop. Don't worry about what side of the car you are on that you may miss a view of beautiful Capetown because the car rotates as you go up the mountain. This ensures that all will be able to get a rotating view of both the bowl of the city and the rugged mountainside of Table Mountain. What a fun way to see the natural wonder of Table Mountain."

Its an interesting place where the trip starts with small way side shops selling wares of tourist-attraction. Do bargain, my advice. The cable car is decently packed & we enjoyed breath-taking view of the Town, the blue sea water & the mountains up close.. I took some very memorable pictures which have since been appreciated by all our friends. The ride itself is enjoyable , though not lasting more than 10 - 15 minutes.

They take photographs of you before you board - these are presented to you at the end of your trip as part of a rather expensive package. My tip is to ask for the photographs alone and the price drops significantly. Take care with the weather as the cars can stop running and this may leave you in a pickle at the top with a long walk back down!"

The queue for the tickets moved fairly quickly, and the cableway provided a 360 degree turn on the trip which I particularly enjoyed as you get to absorb the view from all angles."

On the Friday, it was closed in the morning because of high winds, although it was a perfect sunny day. We went back the next morning, and luckily it was free for children under 18 that day. We did not make any advanced reservations, and there was no wait time (probably because it was low season). Just check on its Web site before you go to make sure it's open."

The cable car itself, rotates 360 degrees the whole way up and down, great for photos and checking out Cape Town from above.

The worst part of the journey to the top was the trip up to the cable car station..... the road was steep, and I got a bit nervous. But the actual trip up the mountain was grand, the car does revolve, but there are bits that are stationary & you can sit there and get up to the top no bother. Once at the top, the view was amazing!!!! We walked around, soaking up the surroundings, and watching others abseil back down!!!! The restaurant is really nice, clean and the food is good. We had no worries coming back down either!!! Highly recommended!"

The cable car has a stationary platform in the middle for anyone afraid of heights or who is prone to motion sickness but the remainder of the platform rotates like a turntable so everyone gets a chance at a good picture out of the one section of the car that has only bars (the rest is plexiglass windows, but the section with safety bars is open to the outdoors). The cars close in high winds, and the winds at the top are stronger than at the bottom, so if you happen to have a clear day with low wind, cancel or reschedule your other plans and make your way to the cable cars!"

Parking is all along the side of the mountain road leading to the cable station. Visitors: take the hop on hop off bus to save a ton of hassles! The cable cars are seamless and rotate so everyone gets a good view. On the top of the mountain there facilities for eating, drinking and shopping, and acres of rocks and walking trails to explore. If you are bringing small kids up here, for goodness sake keep a good eye on them, as most of the cliff face rocks are not fenced off.

Take the trip with enough time to explore up there. No matter what the weather, be prepared -- it rained while we were up there, but not at ground level. Also take binoculars with you.

Despite the warning in various guide books, I've never encountered a line at the ticket counters that took more than 5 minutes to clear on the three occassions (consecutive days, though different times) I was there. It's not really cheap (about 20 Euro), but it's worth the money. They are fair enough to tell you about visibility on the top and explicitly warn you about low or even no visibility. The ride takes about 8 minutes and the gondola turns 360 degrees during the ride, so no matter where you are standing at the beginning, you get the full view. With good visibiblity you have a perfect view over the bay, watch the hikers on their laborious way up or even spot a rock dassie among the rocks."

There is wheelchair access through an elevator to the cableway. Staff is very helpful. It can get crowded and once a person just jumped in front of my view knowing I was in a wheelchair and couldn't see over him. Made him move and continued to enjoy myself. The bottom turns around 360 degrees so you see all aspects. There is a toilet for people with disabilities up top. Be warned, once on top, the terrain is rocky and steep. It can be difficult for those in manual wheelchairs. So unless you are very strong, bring someone strong to help push. A cafe and store is up top too. Worth every penny. Also be warned...if it is too windy, they cant use the cableway and you have to climb down the paths. Not sure how that would work if you are in a wheelchair."

The trip itself is smooth and very efficient - the challenges for any visitor are, depending on the time of day or more importantly the time of year, finding a place to park your car near the lower station and waiting in line to purchase a ticket.For tourists I would recommend a couple of ways you can avoid these potential pitfalls - firstly book you ticket on-line and avoid any queues or delays and also if you take a hop on hop off tour bus it is a great way to get close to the lower cable station without the hassle of finding a place for your car.The trips in the cable car are great - the platform inside the cable car rotates so you get a 360 degree view going both up and down. Of course, the whole purpose of taking the cable car is to reach the top of the Mountain - you will not be disappointed when you get there! Stunning views from all over the top of the mountain and some great walks also."

The walk was pretty exhausting already but getting on the cable car and going up is super easy. During peak season, I highly advise you to order your ticket online as you can skip the massive queues. There is no ATM down at the cable car but you can use visa card.What I loved about the cable car is that it has an open window so you can take proper pictures and the bottom turns so you get a 260 degrees view without moving (which is hard when it's crowded). One of the staff will give a little talk about the mountain etc and it is really nice to hear. There is also some cheesy music playing. The last cable car goes down at 6pm sharp so I was able to see the sunset from up there and it was spectacular! One last important tip: in winter, Cape Town often gets a nasty fog but more often than not this fog just collects in the valley and going up on the mountain you can end up having the most brilliant sunshine! You can check it by going up to Signal Hill or driving further away from the city. Or by just going for it. It is beautiful either way."

The only drawback is that not everyone gets to stand right next to the exterior walls. If you are short, you may only see the backs of people standing in front of you. Not much the cable company can do about that, but if you aware of the problem, worm your way up to the front of the line. Or you can stand behind a group that tries to walk with the turning view and then stand in the space they vacate as they follow the floor. Be aware there are high winds on top of Table Mountain, and that if they are to strong, they may close the aerial cable car down. It is also a lot cooler on top of the mountain so be sure and bring a jacket and, of course, sun screen."

Apart from the view on the top the savannah-like, flat nature at the top was stunning and unique. Decided to take the 2 hours walk down to benefit from the change of angles and found it incredibly beautiful - but also quite a steep hike even going down.

The Trail comprising of random sized lumps of rock snakes horizontally and vertically up to the summit and is quite steep in places great care is needed in placing your steps as the track is very uneven.

It rises steeply and dramatically while the people inside revolve on a moving floor affording views of the entire Cape Peninsula. Table Mountain itself has garnered the prestigious title of being a UNESCO World Heritage site. One should dress warmly as it can be cold and windy on the top. And too much wind means the cable can't operate. Fynbos is the predominant vegetation type. And there are a number of trails and a small restaurant."

A trip to cape town is incomplete without a visit to the Table mountain. the aerial cableway is the best way to explore the best natural stage anyone can see on earth. There are two cable cars which run continuously during peak seasons and holidays and transfer visitors to the top of the Peak and back quickly. The cable cars can hold around 20-25 people a trip. It has glass enclosures and provides a good view of the mountains and the city during its ascend and descend trips. Furthermore, the Car rotates while it climbs and hence the occupants get a 360 degree view of the place. It operates quite smoothly and offers good view of the Hills, Gardens and the city. Children surely love this and most adults also do. The view from the top is breathtaking. It is better to spend atleast 2 hours at the top for some walking and photo ops. Also check the timings of the last trip to the base and ensure that you are out of the peak without fail. The weather can get very rough there at the top of the mountain and night stay is definitely not recommended. Take care."

The only challenge in visiting Table Mountain is the cloud cover, one should be prepared to visit when its clear sky. It can be windy, so carrying appropriate clothing is a good idea.Best views of Cape Town is both on top of the mountain as well as while taking this cable car. Hope the lines are not long!"

It was a public holiday and we waited 45 minutes before even getting to the ticket office. The return cost was 225 rand pp, about \u00a312.50. South African pensioners do get a discount. The ascent takes only 7 or 8 minutes and the cable car floor rotates slowly with one complete revolution per trip so grabbing the front window doesn't work.There are 2 suggested walks. One 30 mins and the other about 50 minutes. The top is remarkably flat and their are prepared pathways but the terrain is much rougher if you wander off the path. Various viewpoints exist but it all depends on the weather. Thick mist spoiled any views over Cape Town on the ascent but the top was clear and the views to the South towards the Cape were very goodThere are a couple of cafes and some toilets but other than that there is no shelter whatsoever if the weather deteriorates. The mountain is not particularly high at 3,558 feet but windproof and waterproof clothing are advisable and in \"iffy\" weather essential. We visited in the morning and it was cloudy but by lunchtime the sun had burned off the mist & cloud. Bear this in mind if planning a visit"

It is easy to understand why Table Mountain was voted as one of the seven Natural Wonders. Viewed from the city of Cape Town (and it dominates the city) it is awe-inspiring and the cable - car ride up to the summit is unforgettable. The cable car ascends at a brisk pace and in addition it rotates 360 degrees to give you an even more amazing view. Once at the top, you are able to roam around but are strongly advised to keep to the demarcated paths for your own safety. Apart from the stunning views of the Cape peninsular and the coast, you will also encounter dassies- furry rodent like creatures that wander about totally unconcerned by the presence of crowds of human visitors. Apparently their closest animal relation is the elephant, although to look at them it is hard to believe. There is a self-service cafe/restaurant at the top where you can sit and take in the stunning view over a cool drink. Be advised that the current South African phenomenon of \"load shedding\" (scheduled power cuts by area) even makes its way up here. This happened during my recent visit, and although generators were run to try and keep as much of the service running as possible, it meant a two hour queue to get bacj down. If you are not accessing the cable car lower station by private car or tour bus, you can make use of My Citi bus service 110 which will connect you with service 107 running between Camps Bay and the city centre. Service 110 runs every 10 minutes. If you are visiting Cape Town don't miss out on the cable car and the opportunity too look out over the southern end of the African continent."

The guys lined up and the ladies sat in the shade - or browsed in the little stores and bought a couple of souvenirs! The stores also have sun hats and t shirts - of course. The ride up was good with great moving views. It was fun to walk around and look at the different areas of Cape Town. Walking around the mountain was lovely but do wear good walking shoes as the terrain can be quite uneven. There are some pathways but not everywhere.

Visitors join natives in looking toward the mountain every day, if not many times a day. It so dominates the horizon one cannot avoid looking at it. The fact the mountain is the site of interesting meterological phenomona makes it interesting and beautiful. Clouds from the cold south Atlantic just over the mountain roll in from the sea almost daily and sometimes hang just on the top to create the sight called by locals, \"The Tablecloth on the Mountain.\" Table Mounntain is truly Cape Town's jewel and source of identity, even if a native has never made the trip to the top.For the visitor traveling to the national park on the flat top a choice of routes and methods are available. Most people will choose to purchase a ticket to make the five or six minute trip from the station located up on the base of the mountain to the top. Once on top you can eat at a nice cafe and hike on the many trails along the top. The views of the ocean, Cape Town and its harbor, and the dramatic other peaks between Cape Town and the sea are magnificant. Tickets are reasonably priced. Warning: in the middle of the day the line to buy a ticket and get on the tramway can be long, e.g. an hour or more. But if you order your tickets online beforehand or using a smart phone after you show up you get to go to the front of the line, making the wait as short as 15 minutes. You can also walk up on the relatively strenuous trail underneath the Tramway. Anyone in reasonably fit condition can make this hike in under a hourIf you are a serious rock climber you can go right up one of several solo or group climbing routes. Some outfitters offer adventure rapelling or absailing from the top for people who do not want to ride or walk down.However you get to the top of Table Mountain do so when the weather is clear. Once the ocean clouds roll in you will miss the fantastic views. Also note that the top of the mountain is often closed due to high winds. A prudent visitor will make the trip early on a clear morning on the first day you are in town. Delaying your visit may mean weather makes the visit unsuitable on the day you had planned to visit."

My best advice is go for sunset. The last car up is 5 pm and in May the sun sets at 6 which is ideal. The last car down is at 6 pm, the photos that you will get are ideal!!!!! By the way, have your hotel call ahead to ensure the cable car is running. It stops when it is windy and the winds can start up in the afternoon. If you are on the mountain, they sound an alarm warning you that they will be shutting it down so you can hurry and hopefully still get down.Enjoy!!!"

You got to go as soon a you see the cloud disappearing above table mountain.We were advised to buy refundable tickets in the hop off hop on bus and go as soon as the cloud clears .When the cloud cleared -long queues appeared at the ticket office and we were able to go with our prepurchased tickets.Signs are not good designating- going to the cable car and we initially joined the ticket purchasing queue in error-so enquire which is the queue for the cable car -if you have a ticket.We were very fortunate as the cloud seem to reappear as we left the mountain and then there is no view."

Take the last cable car of the day (5pm after May 1) to the summit of Table Mountain in order to a watch a masterpiece of creation each evening at sunset! Trails all around the top of the mountain afford you plenty of places to watch the majestic sunset experience without feeling like you're doing it with a thousand of your best friends. Last cable car back down is at 6pm during the winter months as well, so you'll have to leave right after the sun has finished its show, but what an amazing thrill to see! Cable car round trip is R195, but so worth it!"

That way you avoid the long line and pass by the rest who are buying their tickets. Once the cars start operating it goes quite quick and about 65 people can fit in a car. It takes less than 5 minutes to get up there and once at the top you can roam easily. The top is marked well so you can walk long distances or simply admire the views of the coast below. It is just as easy to get down. Absolute highlight!"

We had 4 nights in Cape Town and were advised by both friends and our hotel to go when it was open - which may sound a bit strange.We arrived at 2.30pm, and decided we'd go at 4pm that afternoon (our hotel was going to arrange to drop us off). It was a clear day and we were keen to ensure we went up Table Mountain. They called us at 3.58pm to say it had closed for the day due to the winds...... luckily we were able to get dropped off again following a day trip the next day. The tickets we purchased via our hotel were valid for 3 weeks I think, so nothing was lost.The cable car up is quick and efficient. The inside of the car is on a turntable, so it rotates one turn during the ascent / descent. This means it doesn't matter where you stand when you get on!The views were amazing at the top of the mountain, and you were able to follow some paths and walk around the plateau. There was plenty of flowers and wildlife to see !There is a small gift shop and caf\u00e9 - but we didn't stop.We enjoyed every minute (well I did - my hubby isn't great with heights !!) - but it was a must for our visit here.We did a bus tour a few days later, which has a drop off point at the cable car - the queues were much longer that day...."

The cable car is modern and safe, turns whilst travel and give you a great view. They have seating in the middle which was perfect for my mom that is scared of heights, it made it possible for her to enjoy the ride. Once on top of the mountain you cannot describe the view, incredible comes to mind! They also have a restaurant for refreshments. Expensive but one of the things you have to do in life."

Being in the low season, the queue was non existent, but the guide advised that the queue can get quite ridiculous at peak summer season. Staff was good. be prepared to spend some time walking on the top once you get there. Bring some warm clothes and walking/ trekking shoes. If you feel energetic, walk up and buy a ticket to get down on the cable car.A very worthwhile stop on your trip"

It was cloudy and at this time of year you should take a coat or jersey as it can be very cold when you get up to the top. For a local resident I find the costs steep at R225 per adult and R110 for kids. The restaurant has improved over the years and the quality is much better however they are a bit chaotic.The cableway is free on your birthday if you have something on you to prove it. And of course you can always hike up/down or both to save some doshSadly there were a number of tourists walking around with beers and other drinks and bins are located towards the cable car building and restaurant area so I did see cups, cans and wrappers tossed into the fynbos whilst walking across the mountain top.This is an absolute must do for any tourist visiting Cape Town and should be on every Capetonians holiday to do list at least once a year."

The hotel informed us it had been closed for a number of days. We were actually at the botanical gardens with a driver when the driver received word that the cable car was running again. We decided to make a break for it and even though we would have a shorter time than originally planned we headed off. I am so glad we did - no lines to board any of the cable cars and the views were amazing! We were lucky enough to take the last cable car down off the mountain and were able to see a portion of the sunset.The next day the attraction was packed with long cues. So glad we made the most of our visit time to Cape Town by being flexible with our itinerary."

If you get there early enough though there shouldn't be much of one, its also good as after around 9am it starts to get very warm and the sun can be a little strong so you can be down by the time it gets too hot to walk around comfortably. Do check the weather though to make sure you can see the top... if you cant, no point in going. You get spectacular views from the top, and the cable car does a 360 on the way up giving everyone a chance to see the full views available. The caf\u00e9 at the top is fun and sells lots of different things from milkshakes to prosecco, the gift shop is a little pricey and you can get most of the stuff sold there at the bottom or in town anyway...

There are good transport links with the new MyCiti bus service so its not necessary to book an expensive tour. Parking can be a nightmare if you arrive at a busy time.

The cable car ride is free for SA residents on their birthdays (you have to show your ID or proof of residence) so it was a great start to mine. The cable car revolves as you go up so everyone gets a chance to see the amazing views. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Everyone that handled my ticket wished me a happy birthday when they saw that I had a birthday ticket.The view on the way up and on top of the mountain is nothing short of amazing. Here you can see Cape Town from so many sides, uninterrupted. The hike over to the next mountain was also very worth it. A must-do for every Capetonian and every visitor."

It gives you a different and much easier way of taking in the views and glory of South Africa, specifically Cape Town and Table Mountain. It was worth every dollar for the ticket! The shop/cafe/cable house at the top of Table Mountain is lovely and provides mostly everything one could imagine or want after a hike up or around Table Mountain. The cable car itself turns and gives ample time and views to everyone in the car. So don't fret if you aren't facing an opening when entering the car, you will get a turn! If you are scared of heights, don't worry, it doesn't take long and was about a 3 to 4 minute ride down. I assume it's like that on the way up as well! However, if you can handle a fun hike and are fit, take the trails up! You'll be glad you did!! I promise!!"

The views on the top are truly magnificent and a must for any Capetown visitor, if only the weather permits. The place is closed under high winds, and the Table Mountain top is often covered with mist. So find the right time and get up there. On the top there's a great restaurant with something for everyone. You can also take shorter and longer walks and enjoy a great deal of fantastic views. One more comment - since we climbed up on foot, we had to purchase our ticket down, at the top. But then we were exposed to some South African humor, which wasn't really THAT tactful: After waiting some 45 minutes on the line, you finally get to the spot where you're being sent to purchase the ticket. The two ladies at the desk made it very clear, that \"there are no more tickets to go down. We now give only children. You'll have to go down by foot. We're sorry but we'e sold out.\" I'm all for humor, REALLY, but it took several minutes, and my wife who stayed on the line, had to let many people pass her, and we missed our turn of the cable down, and had to wait for the next one. After such long time at the line, it was quite annoying and much less funny."

Buy you tickets online as the queues can be hectic at times. Also a good idea to get the Mycity bus or a cab as parking and traffic can be a challenge during the summer months. Walking up Platteklip Gorge and getting the cablecar down is greatly recommended, but you have to be reasonably fit, if you have a fear of heights this walk will not be a problem unlike some of the other walks on the mountain. If walking up you can buy a one way ticket on top for your ride down. Be warned to do the walk up early in the morning, starting after 6h00 in summer can leave you exhausted and very hot, take at least one litre of water person for the approx. 2 hour walk."

Of course I chose the 360 'why not eh' great choice, as although the car was busy at least you get to see everything. The view from the car itself is amazing - tip 'Stand by the open window' as the screens are a bit scratched so photos look a bit cloudy if you try take them through it.Excellent experience & well worth the drive up there."

Arrive at the top I need a drink ant go to the shop. To my surprise a bottle of God giving water as almost 20.00 *(^*(%^&*%^&*%&*^%*&%&*%&*% rand. Because its the only place you can get a drink the charge as much as they like. This is a rip off. How on earth can the average citizen in South Africa afford any of this. And yes they also want to view from the top. This is absolute discrimination against South Africans and a rip off against all the foreign visitors. And I must say this is not the only place. All SA attraction sites do the same. I wish no one visit these places at all."

One tip is to rearrange your plans if Table Mountain is clear and the weather is sunny as the clouds come down sometimes so there is no point going to look at the view or it is windy and the cable car doesn't run."

Rather than a day ticket we booked a ticket which allowed us access at any time over a two week period which gave us flexibility with the weather. A good tip is to go early in the morning, we arrived just after 08:00 and were at the top by 08:30. At that time of day the air at the top is really fresh and well worth getting up early for."

I knew I had to go up Table Mountain on the cable car (walking wasn't an option due to time limits) even though I have no head for heights, and I'm so glad I did. Visiting the lower cable car station is no substitute for the real thing, so I had to grit my teeth and enter the cable car, but it really wasn't a problem as there is no sensation of movement at all, it felt more like an elevator. The operators are used to people like me and offered me a seat in the middle of the cable car, but I was fine standing on the way down. Too scared to look out though and waited till I got to the top. The views from the summit down to Cape Town and along Table Bay and False Bay are amazing.My husband followed the advice to book tickets as soon as you see blue sky above Table Mountain and by the time we went up at about 9:30 the morning slots were all fully booked. By the time we left the cable car was closed due to high winds, so we were very lucky to have gone when we did. We saw lots of disappointed people arriving as we waited for our taxi back - no excuse really as there are lots of signs along the access road saying it was closed, but I guess they didn't believe it as it was lovely and sunny with just a light breeze down below."

I don\u2019t usually read reviews before I go somewhere so certainly others mention it but I was surprised. In the very brief ride up and again going down, the floor rotated a complete 360 degrees and we all saw the same beautiful views at least once. Very unique in my experience. BE SURE TO TAKE YOUR SUNSCREEN if it is a sunny day because you really need about four hours to completely walk all over the top. There is some wheelchair accessability but not over the complete top of the mountain."

It is one of the new 7 wonders of the world.There were supposed to be animals, but we didn't spot any.Entry fee is cheaper if bought online. Currently charges R225.00 online, but I believe it is R250.00 if ticket is bought at the site. The cable car rotates, so one can see different views from different angles.

Check the weather forecast on the day you intend to go as the mountain is closed when the wind speed gets to high. Be patient, pre-book and enjoy this wonder of nature."

Book in advance if you can as the ticket queues can be very long especially if the cableway is closed the previous day; it means you don't have to stand out in the heat in a queue for up to two-3 hours.Access is by lots of stairs until you reach the cable car entry point so wear sensible shoes. Once on the cable car you get a bit of a surprise. The cable car rotates slowly through 360 degrees as you go up the mountain so you get an amazing panoramic view of Cape Town. And it only gets better when you reach the top. The best place in the world to have lunch and take in the breath-taking views.The only thing to be aware of is the weather. If high winds blow in the cableway shuts for safety reasons. If this happens when you are at the top of the mountain you have to be prepared to walk down."

Definitely have to book your tickets on line as this enabled us to join a much shorter queue to go up the stairs/elevator to the cable car. As we travel up to the mountain the whole cable car slowly moves around so you have a full 360 view of Cape Town and all the surrounding areas. On arrival at the top we are almost immediately greeted by little rock rabbits or dassies as they are commonly called who are so used to all the people show no fear at all. The beautiful winding paths and rocky trails show only more exquisite surroundings including the big blue ocean all around. In between the rocks are little summer flowers and very lazy lizards with here and there a dance of the most colourful butterflies. You feel so close to the wide expanse of sky which was completely clear from the previous days gusting winds. The little restaurant serves the most delectable pizza slices just enough top up from breakfast a few hours before. Their coffee was also very good. Amazing, awesome, a must place to visit!"

( You can walk up from Platteklip Gorge - takes us and our children about an hour, then across the top to the cable station - 10-20 min, take the Car down then walk along the road back to your car) If you going up and down by cable car book in advance, or arrive early - the queues get loooong...but having said that it's well worth the wait coz up there the views are spectacular. Check the weather before you go. I would recommend you only to go up if it's clear or clouds are high because if a 'tablecloth' cloud decends on the mountain you will have to leave immediately and cut your site seeing short, besides you can see nothing in the cloud and it's freezing. If you go very early you can have breakfast up on top, and if you go late in the day you can have supper up there. For locals you get a free trip on your birthday, not sure if that applies to foreigners - ask when you book, and families get discount - again not sure if it applies to foreigners so, if you are a foreigner ask when booking. Do obey the signs and warnings, it's not like Europe where everything is fenced and guarded, you will fall off if you go too close to the edge. It's got chain guides and fences in some places and because so many tourists do go too close to the edge and get hurt or worse, there are security patrols now, but really, it's just not worth your while ignoring the warnings. Don't take your eyes off your children....they don't tend to exercise caution, I've seen one little boy run off the path so close to the edge my knees turned to jelly. It's big up there so take some time and explore, you can walk far and go to the reservoir, or you can just stay on the actual 'table' part - either way it's an experience you won't get anywhere else."

We got a taxi from our hotel, but by the time we got there, the clouds had covered the top, so we hung around for an hour to see if they would clear. They did not. So we walked from to the waterfront (not advisable - takes well over 2 hrs) we ended up having a late lunch there, and looking back at the mountain it looked like it was clearing so grabbed another taxi back to it. Luckily most people had given up on it for the day, so we immediately bought 2 tickets as there was no line, and literally walked into a car as its doors were closing.

Take the cable car up early in the morning and see the sun rise over the distant mountains, or go in the early evening for a summer sunset picnic. In the high summer tourist season it can get very busy with long queues, but you can save hassle by booking online. An important word of caution though - even though it is in our `backyard' a trip up Table Mountain needs all the precautions of any other mountain trip - sturdy footwear, awareness of weather conditions and appropriate clothing, water and sunscreen.

Wait times on weekends are longer, but don't be put off by the long lines, the whole process is very efficient. We were in a line from near the ticket office outside the building and were in a car after 20 minutes. Good people watching in the queue as there are visitors from all over the world. Take a jacket regardless of what the weather is like on the ground, it can be cool and windy on the table top.

Sometimes there may be a queue to the cable car especially during peak season so factor this in for time as well.

Everyone should go up Table Mountain on the aerial cableway at least once, and having done that they will surely want to go again, if only to descend more gently after a vigorous walk up the mountain. The new cable cars (some of us remember the old box cars that used to go up, carrying just 10 or 15 passengers at a time) hold a lot of people and rotate slowly as they ascend and descend so there's no need to hurry on boar to get the best position. The trip is not cheap however, and the assumption seems to be that all the overseas visitors will not notice how expensive it is. The stunning views make up for any misgivings about this however."

It's easy to get lost up there, but most intersections are signposted.Be sure to take warm clothing as the weather can change very quickly. The further you venture from the upper cable station the more exciting it gets, and less crowded. The adventurous can consider a trip up and then walk down to Kirstebosch and return by taxi, or reverse this route. A local guide is recommended as the going can get tricky. It's a great green lung at the centre of this great city, and maybe its single most appealing feature."

I love visiting places where you can get up high and look out over the city - like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the cable cars in Barcelona and even Grenoble. But none of those offer the jaw-droppingly spectacular vistas that Table Mountain and its cable car do. The booking/ticketing process is efficient, as is boarding and disembarking - and the fact that the car can accommodate so many people and offer them all great views courtesy of the rotating floor means no-one loses out on a single view. Once up top (having remembered to take along a jacket because the weather can be much cooler up at 1086m above sea level with cool winds often a factor up top) you realise what a marvel of nature Table Mountain is. The views up north towards Blouberg and Melkbosstrand with Robben Island prominently situated in the middle of Table Bay are rivalled only by the views eastwards, over the city, Cape flats and towards the distant Hottentots Holland range behind Somerset West. A short stroll over well paved paths and you can look south down the rest of the Cape peninsula, overlooking Camps Bay and its beautiful crescent of palm-fringed white beach - or even further to the south-east where Simonstown, Fish Hoek and Muizenberg lurk.Yes, it can be crowded because this is one of those \"must do\" things when in the Mother City but it's easy enough to head off down one of the many well-marked paths and get away from your fellow tourists. A walk to the Platteklip gorge edge is recommended, for the sheer entertainment value of watching more intrepid hikers plod their way up the trail from the road below. One word of advice - keep an eye on the weather, particularly the wind because it can become quite brisk and bring in the distinctive cloud 'tablecloth' rapidly and can be somewhat disorientating. Stick to the paths and don't be tempted to wander off and find a shortcut should the cloud come in."

We had our walkabout, took some pics, went to the souvenir shop and bought my son a T shirt. He has them from the strangest places.

The view from the summit is amazing, there are trails to stroll around offering 360 degree of panorama. I would recommend the mornings to visit as the wind gets up in the late afternoon plus the clouds start to form the tablecloth about the same time. Watching the clouds roll in from the city is also not to be missed."

The ride up and the view at the top is spectacular, as reviewed by many others. There is a cafe so you can have a bite to eat or drink. I highly recommend this if you are planning to hike down. The hike down was very difficult with very uneven terrain an no rails to hold on to and all down, no level areas. It took me 3 hours and I was exhausted, I am a bit older but not in bad shape. Just saying, eat and take lots of water, wear good shoes and enjoy the amazing views on the way down. It is about a mile hike on the road back to the entrance after you get off the mountain."

The best advice I can share is to take the cable up the Table on the first clear day you have as Cape Town can have all seasons within days! It is also closed during inclement weather.Our hotel concierge booked our tickets online which saved on waiting in a long queue. The rotating cable car provided spectacular views on the way up and down. Despite going in the summer it was cold at the top but the 360 views, landscape and wildlife (we saw lizards and Dassie) made up for any discomfort. Be prepared to spend at least a few hours of you want to walk around to all the viewing areas."

The views are stunning and the tram is fast and entertaining. One the the best features is that the tram's floor rotates so that everyone gets a good view during the short ride to the top. We took the evening tram ride and were amazed the the beauty of watching the sunset. However be prepared for a longer wait due to everyone wanting to head down once the sun set. If we would have done anything better, we would have brought a little picnic. And don't forget your jacket, even in the summer it got chilly."

            "review": "On a clear day you can see forever!. Table Mountain has been rated on one of the natural 7 wonders of the world and is worth a visit whether you are a visitor or a local. The cable car takes 65 passengers and does one full revolution on the way up or down so everyone gets a full 360 degree view. The mountain is covered in local vegetation and has beautiful pathways that traverse the top. The lookout points are spectacular and provide views across Robben Island, up the West Coast, across the East Coast and along the 12 Apostles. A must for the more enthusiastic is a walk to McClears Beacon which should take about 30 minutes that takes you past Platteklip Gorge and onto the wetland area on the mountain. Pathways have wooden walkways above any wet areas to keep your shoes dry! If you want to walk up the mountain, take Platteklip Gorge which is about one kilometre past the lower cable station, as it is the easiest route and should take the average person about an hour and a half to two hours. Leave early to avoid the sun against the face of the mountain and take sunblock and plenty of water. At least two litres per person. You will never tire of Table Mountain. I have climbed the mountain using all the various pathways and did a birthday trip up the cable way recently. Magnificent. Remember, you get a free trip up and down the cable way on your birthday but don't forget to bring your ID documents! Have fun."

The aerial cable is world class in construction and its 360 rotating axis gave the view an even more awesome twist. Surely it was crowded, but oddly i did not find it annoying.

The simple fact is, if you are a tourist in Cape Town, you HAVE to go up Table Mountain.The tips to avoid disappointment and long queues during peak season are simply to book online at www.tablemountain.net and print your tickets out to take with you - this one act will save you hours in the queue to buy tickets. Furthermore, make sure you get there early in the morning - around 7:30 should do. With my trip, I did this, and waited less than 20 minutes before i was at the top of the mountain. People that arrived after eight, and didnt buy tickets online looked like they were in for a good two hour wait.Secondly, regardless of how pleasant the weather seems to be on the ground, TAKE A WARM JACKET. If you dont, you will more than likely be paying a hefty sum to buy one from the shop at the top cableway station!Of course, you always have the option of walking up or down - make no mistake, this is no leisurely stroll - you need to be quite fit and able, as there are bits that are more serious than walking a trail.Thats it - Make a plan to get there!"

But our tour guide from earlier in the day (Cape Convoy....Rob is awesome) said....if it's open, go. I have to say it was probably our best decision all trip. I have never seen such an amazing sunset as we did that night. Stunning, truly stunning (see photo). In addition the next morning (our original plan) was crappy and overcast. Due to that they were not running the Cableway. So we made the right decision. the only other suggestion would be to buy tickets ahead of time. I think they are good for a few days or longer. that will save you about 30 min of waiting in line. Oh and you can bring your own food/drinks, just be smart about it."

The cable car can take 30 people and is an amazing 4min ride with a rotating floor. The top of the mountain has been expanded for walking trails, and wonderfully integrated decks and view sites. We saw the sunset and many people came up to picnic. Stunning and pristine. Well done Cape Town. I would definitely recommend."

Pick the day to do this and check out their website http://www.tablemountain.net - it will tell you if the cable car is open or closed (they close the cablecar on windy days). The view from the top is stunning and, if you like walking, wear a good pair of walking shoes or boots as there are plenty of trails to hike. Remember to take sunscreen, a hat and water. There are easier walks ranging around 30 minutes where you can see the views from either side of the mountain. The cablecar is great as it revolves and gives you a 360 degree view. As previous reviewers have said book your tickets beforehand as it saves time. If you book through the red/blue city bus tours you have 14 days in which to use it. Tickets cost R225 return for adults. You can choose how much time you spend here from about 1.5 hours upwards. We will be back and take a picnic at sunset if we have time (tickets are also 1/2 price after 630pm)."

We bought early-access tickets at R300 online the day before so we could go up with the Cable Car between 7:30 and 8:00 am and not have to stand in a queue to buy tickets. We saved the electronic tickets on a phone so they could be scanned on entry, which worked fine. It was a good move to go early as people started queuing by about 7 am in the morning. We made it onto the first cable car of the day on 3rd Jan 2015 and it was a great experience! The cable car takes about 5 minutes to reach he top cable car station and does a 360 degree rotation of the cable car floor, so that everyone can see all around without having to push and shove to see out the various sides. What a great idea! Once we reached the top, the mountain was shrouded in mist with a light rain, but this did not dampen our spirits as we grabbed coffees at the restaurant and waited for the mist to clear. What a sight when the mist finally cleared at 10 am and we could see all around, down to the City and all the way to Robben Island! One of the best experiences in the world and now also one of the new 7 Wonders of Nature. Enjoy!"

Wonderful views and interesting plants. In one spot where signage was not clear we found ourselves heading off on a steep path that we realized eventually was not part of the circuit, so turned back. It was much cooler up there, quite chilly in the morning; and the sun was very strong, so we ended up sunburned where we weren't protected by long sleeves, long pants and hats (the back of our hands!)."

It was fun full of exciting experiences, it was my first time to ride on a cable car and I was so so excited. The trip was fantastic, superb. It was so awesome riding to the top and viewing the beautiful landscape of capetown. It took only 3 mins to the top. If you are to go in the morning you need to have a jacket as it is a bit chilly or cold in the top. The view is so perfect when you are already at the top, it is really awesome. we were given three hours to view or to be at the top but one can always go back down at any time he or she wishes to as the cable cars are always moving to and from the ground to the top. just try table mountain and you will really enjoy it. You really ought to take care of your ticket because it is the same ticket that you use when you go back down because if you loose it you wont be allowed to ride back."

How amazing would it be if they had staff that walked around and could take tourists own cameras to take pictures for them?"

The views are of course quite spectacular and nice leisurely walks can be enjoyed amongst the fijnbos environment atop the mountain. More energetic visitors can climb up or down though going down by foot is not fun given the steepness, and combine with a cable car journey either way.The queue can get very long during the summer months so try to show up early - taxis can bring you to and from the site with a taxi rank there being convenient for your return. It is best to go in the morning as the weather is less predictable during the afternoon, with the typical 'tablecloth' of clouds more likely to appear in the afternoon."

Platform within the cable car rotates as it ascends or descends so everyone gets a chance to observe the mountain & the ocean. It is a world heritage site & rightly so. View from the top is spectacular & to be remembered for a lifetime. Top of the mountain is smaller than you would think. There are about three walks you take around the summit. Fairly easy walk with the correct footwear, i.e. not flip-flops. Walks vary from 30 - 75 minutes. Natural plants & flowers are beautiful & there lots of birds, harmless tiny black lizards etc, to be seen. Our good advice is to buy & print your tickets in advance, on-line. This will save the huge line if you purchase tickets at the Cableway entrance. Cable itself is over 1000 meters in length. Originally built 85 years ago, but of course cables & cars have been updated and replaced regularly. Don't miss this attraction."

Unfortunately it was a really foggy day and we could only see about 10 metres in front of us. We still went up but couldn't see any of the spectacular views promised. The cafe at the top opened early since it was cold and wet and all of us wanted to get inside since we couldn't see anything of table mountain itself. Unfortunately, the cafe clearly isn't set up for early morning business. The breakfast buffet wasn't open so we had to have sandwiches for breakfast and then we had to order coffees at the kiosk to collect after. The coffee, just a simple filter coffee, took over 20 minutes to be ready. This is simply unacceptable. How on earth can filter coffee take 20 minutes to make?!The problem with running the cable car in all weathers apart from extreme wind if problematic when very foggy. We booked tickets and missed out on all the sights after travelling all that way. Still, it's a natural wonder so I can't complain about nature taking control and doing what it does. Overall, we had back luck with the weather which can happen to anything & anyone at any time, but the cafe was a shambles."

During peak season, roads upto the cableway station can be congested. It worked for us: wait until about 15.30pm and then take a cab (50 Rand approx) and have you dropped off. Walk the table mountain top (short stroll or slightly longer), stay for a few bites in the restaurant (reasonably priced) and wait for sunset (or not) and head on down before the masses, by now convened on the top)."

I went to table mountain as part of my tour with Gate1 Travel company.The tickets were already purchased in advanced by our tour guide so I cant comment on the process of getting the entrance tickets.Here are my thoughts:1- bring a warm sweater or fleece. It is quite chilly up on the mountain and it is a shame to see people uncomfortable and cold. To truly have fun and enjoy the experience, please remember to bring a light jacket or sweater. 2- need about 1 hour on the top. bring a camera to take some really nice pictures.If you are in cape town, this is a must do activity."

It took us about 5 minutes to park and pay for our tickets, literally no queues!The ride up was fantastic. When we were on the mountain we were able to get a good view of the sunset and see all of Cape Town. I took a light jacket, but the temperature really drops in the evening when on the mountain so remember to carry a jacket and beanie.Overall, such a lovely experience and something all South Africans should try out!"

Don't worry about getting a good spot in the cable car - the floor rotates, so everyone gets to see out the main window and take their photos. At the top of the mountain, there are 3 marked paths of varying length, OR you can choose to hike 45 mins to the very highest point. And/or hike all the way down to the base. For the less athletic, there is a cafe, loos and you can even buy a beer! It's surprisingly easy to spend 2-3 hours up there.

After an eight-hour flight from London, I knew I had to take advantage of the first opportunity I could seize in getting up Table Mountain, and it turned out to be the afternoon we arrived. It was a beautiful day without clouds, and as it turned out, Table Mountain was shrouded with clouds from that point afterward. My partner and I checked our bags into our hotel in Green Point and immediately took a cab to the site. It costs R 250 for a round-trip or R 115 for one-way since many people like to hike up or down. Luckily it wasn\u2019t overly crowded, and we got up in about five minutes, enough for the tramcar to make one full rotation.There are only three rotational trams in the world, and the Cableway has slightly smaller compartments and runs up to a lower elevation than its counterpart in Palm Springs, California. At the same time, I find the panoramic view much more breathtaking here because you see the splendor of greater Cape Town and Table Bay below from a far greater number of vista points. There is a restaurant, a caf\u00e9 and a souvenir shop, all of which are too crowded to enjoy during your brief sojourn here. Instead, I would take in the uniquely beautiful topography of this part of the world set against the Atlantic seaboard. Sunset is the best time to be here, but be mindful that you will face longer wait times."

The cable cars are very modern and the whole process is run quite efficiently - nothing like the old days when the lines were really long.I would recommend going early to miss the crowds and also so you have time to explore the top of the mountain. There is plenty to do up there and there is a decent restaurant too. Prices are in line with what you would pay for attractions of this nature around the world, but it is money well spent on a visit to Cape Town."

This gives great views on the way up and down and, of course, access to the fabulous views from the top. The authorities have a difficult dilemma here because more people want to get to the top of table mountain than the cableway can accommodate, but to increase capacity would create overcrowding on the top threatening the fragile environment. This means that you either have to ensure you get up at a time when queues are short or resign yourself for a long wait. Seize the opportunity as soon as you can on a nice day - you may not get another chance to experience the stunning views."

We drove up anyway and tried to do the hike up since the cableway was closed but it was just too windy and so we turned around. Luckily on our last day the weather cooperated and we tried it again and wound up riding the cableway up and hiked down. It was foggy at the top and the maps aren't the best but eventually we found our way to the Platteklip Gorge hike down the mountain. It was very steep and rocky and took us about 75 minutes of walking slow and carefully but the views were worth it!

Remember though that the weather at the top cannot be predicted from below, and it can change in the time taken to ride the cable car to the top. Treat it with respect.Once up there select one of the many beautiful walks - flat or undulating - but listen out for the siren alerting to changing weather: get back fast or be prepared to undertake the quite demanding walk down.

This is THE major attraction in Cape Town to our minds, and the cable car is the easy way up to the top of Table Mountain, when the wind isn't too strong. Unfortunately for us, for the first 2 days we were in Cape Town the mountain was closed because the wind was too strong. Each morning we checked if it was open, and on the 3rd day - Success, the mountain was open and we immediately bought our tickets on-line and headed for the lower cable car station. Thank god we bought the tickets first because when you get to the station there is one queue for those with tickets, and a second enormously long queue for those who needed to buy tickets first. Tickets are valid for 14 days so buy one first so you're ready to go as soon as the mountain is open. The cable car takes many people at a time and does one complete rotation as you ascend or descend so everybody gets to see the views. On top there are shops, toilets, a restaurant, and a choice of 3 routes round huge top on clearly marked paths, ranging in time from 15 minutes too re an hour. We liked the views in all directions, and particularly the \"Dassies\", small approx 2 foot long animals native to the mountain and rumored to be related to the elephant!We chose the middle length route but unfortunately had to cut that short as the cloud came down and visibility reduced dramatically. Even so, it was a great excursion and well worth the wait and the visit despite the weather. When we got down, we found the mountain was closed again!"

The best way to take advantage of the unbelievable views of the City and surrounds is to go up the Mountain on the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway, one of the longest single span cableways in the world. Built in 1929, the Cableway is celebrating 85 years in operation in 2014. During this period many thousands of locals and international tourists have enjoyed the trip to the top and back. The views in all directions are breathtaking, a photographer's paradise! When on top of the Mountain the sounds of the City below drift up in a hushed whisper, reminding one that even in the midst of a civilization there is peace and tranquility. The Cableway runs all year round, but please check the operating times and weather conditions. These can play havoc with the operation as strong winds and cloudy conditions usually halt the trips. The new cable cars are safe, state-of-the-art, with wonderful open viewing and do one complete revolution before reaching the top. You do not need to move around the cabin to get your perfect picture therefore. One cable car goes up the mountain while the one descends similtaneously. There are frequent trips every day with the number depending on seasonality. Make an advance booking/s, so that you ensure sure that you don't have to stand in a long queue in the hot sun! Avoid certain times of the year if possible, such as the December/January holidays and Easter, when the Cableway can get crowded. There are plenty of dining options on the Mountain top, or you could take your own refreshments up with you. There are also curio shops at the Upper and Lower Cable Stations. For the fit and adventurous amongst you, try climbing the mountain and coming down on the Cableway or do it in reverse. Travelling on the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway is a 'must' when visiting Cape Town, one of the most beautiful cities on the planet. Go up, get away from it all and marvel at what nature has provided, with a little help from us humans.I've been on the Cableway many times, from when I was small boy to the present and never tire of it!"

The backdrop to pretty much any photograph and never out of sight (unless you are unlucky enough to be there when it is covered in cloud). However, just looking and gasping at its majesty isn't enough, you really need to get to the top and see the most beautiful views (possibly) in the world. The Aerial Cableway is safe and modern and a wonderful experience in itself. It runs smoothly and efficiently and if you buy your tickets online, there is usually only the shortest queue or even no queue. (This may be different in December though). The price was very reasonable for British tourists and you can stay at the top as long as you like where there is a cafe and shop and lovely walks. However, as safety is always important, the cable car will close if the weather is bad or windy (and it can get VERY windy in Cape Town), so you may have your visit cut short at these times. You can check the status of the cableway online and the tickets are valid for 14 days from purchase so you should buy them at the start of your holiday and keep them handy for the day when the sky is clear and the wind is light.Parking can be a problem as there is limited parking available and at busy times you may end up with quite a long and steep walk in the heat. I have used the Hop On Hop Off bus before to get there (From the Waterfront or Town) and I believe there is a local bus and taxis as well.The top of the mountain is a protected nature reserve and if you are lucky you will spot some wildlife. We saw the famous \"Dassies\" and lizards. I would never consider a holiday to Cape Town complete without a trip up the mountain. This is another Must Do attraction in South Africa.

An additional plus: the car slowly rotates as it rides so everyone on board can get a view in all directions. Someone was thinking when they designed this. I can't say enough for the view up top, the obvious ecological efforts that have been made to preserve the natural flora and fauna. The cafes are not oppressive and you can put up with the fact that your descent includes a mandatory walkway through the gift shop (I bought a postcard). Buy your ticket on-line to get a little head-start. There was a lineup with a wait, but good things come to those....I took the Red Tour bus to the base of the cableway, which was very easy and a cheap ride.

Just as few Parisians climb the Eiffel Tower, and even fewer New Yorkers scale the Statue of Liberty, Table Mountain appears to be largely a foreigner magnet. Few South Africans to be found. Still, absolutely beautifulVery glad we did it on our first day, when the sky was clear. Every other day, Table Mtn was closed due to high winds/clouds. Be prepared for lines. One tip: Avoid the Soviet-style queues for tickets by purchasing cable car ticket via the Hop On Hop Off bus (\"Red Bus\"). Another tourist trap, but a good (and cheap) introduction to the city, transportation, and a way to \"skip the queue.\" It saved us a good 45 minutes."

The views at the top are spectacular - though a jersey is recommended as it can be a lot cooler at the top. You can purchase tickets in advance, and it can be part of your Red Route Tour of Cape Town on the Hop on / Hop off Bus, which saves parking. Highly recommended."

Be careful, however, that the tram closes during periods of high winds, so a call in advance is recommended. If on the mountain and the winds pick up, a siren will sound alerting people that they have only a few minutes to get on the cableway before it descends and stops operating. This can be a problem if you have hiked some distance from the upper station -- you'll probably not have heard the siren and will not have time to return before the cable car descends. In any event, the hiking is great and highly encouraged."

The floor does rotate very slowly, which again is no worry and it does mean that everyone gets a full 360 view.Once at the top you will be amazed at the views over Cape Town and the Bay. Walk a few yards and look at the view in the other direction, again breath taking!A very well stocked restaurant at the top provides a good range of both food and drink.A real 'must do' when in Cape Town, but only go if you are assured of no clouds!"

The excuse was it was windy but it did not really seem to be and there was a lot of maintenance activity. We tried again the next day in the morning but the queues were large so drove elsewhere and came back a few hours later about 4 pm. This time there were minimal lines for tickets and we were on the second car out. Views on the way up and at the top were stunning and the restaurant is good too.My advice is, probably not worth pre-booking, choose a good day with visibility, no cloud and little wind, go mid afternoon. I think the halfprice at 6 PM causes traffic to drop off toward that time; it certainly picked up afterwards."

We fought through traffic on a weekday evening after days of the mountain being shrouded in cloud for the sunset and it didn't disappoint. Here are my top tips to visit Table Mountain via the cable car. Do go on a clear day, and at sunset for simply stunning views. As soon as the sun started to set there were very long queues in cold winds for the descent, so plan your visit accordingly. Get there early to have time to enjoy and photograph the views, then to enjoy a glass of wine watching the sunset. Book your tickets online in advance to skip the queue and get there early as parking is on the road, which isn't lit at night. Stand near the windows on the cable car journey to enjoy the views and dress warmly as it can get very cold and windy at the top."

A ride up the mountain in these modern cable cars with its revolving floors is an outstanding treat to all visitors.I've been up the mountain many times (generally by foot), but this was the first time for my youngest daughter and she was mesmerized with the revolving floor - but I guess it was more getting the panoramic view that made it so special.We made use of the special after 6pm discounted price. The queue was not that long. The car took about 60 people up every 4 minutes, so the lines moved fast. It moves at about 10 metres per second and can transport about 800 people per hour. Just a pity that it goes so fast as it is so enjoyable. What is astonishing is that the cableway has been running for over 80 years with no accidents.Table Mountain is about 1000m above sea level with its highest point being Maclear's Beacon at 1085m. It's believed that Table Mountain is at least six times older than the Himalayas having been formed under the sea some 600 million years ago.The original inhabitants of the Cape called the Mountain the \"Hoerikwaggo\" meaning Mountain of the Sea. Today there is a popular hike called the Hoerikwaggo.What is good is that the website of the Cable Car company gives the weather indicator which can save one a trip for nothing. The Weather was just perfect when we went up - good views all around, nice balmy weather for a picnic and the mountains was full of people coming to enjoy the view.There are 3 free guided walks from 09h00 to 15h00 ranging from the Dassie Walk (15 min) to the Agama Walk (30 min) to the Klipspringer Walk (45 min). The mountain top has been nicely paved making it a pleasure for the visitor to walk around and view the sights.The Mountain boasts over 1460 different species of fynbos and vegetation and it is a World Heritage site.Tickets can be bought online which allows one to avoid the queue's - unfortunately the special priced ones have to be bought there which can take some time.There is a souvenir shop which is not too pricey and a restaurant for those wanting to \"eat\" out."

This is an unorthodox review since we unfortunately weren't able to actually use the cableway due to windy weather while we were in Cape Town. We bought tickets in advance on-line since we had read about the inconvenience of having to stand in a long line to buy tickets on site and then stand in another long line to actually ride the cableway. Due to windy conditions we weren't able to use our tickets, but we got a refund (credited back to our credit card) with no hassle at all. We just sent an e-mail to the company (refunds@tablemountain.net) within the 14 day window after the initial date on our tickets. Very simple. If we're ever lucky enough to visit Cape Town again we will undoubtedly buy Cableway tickets in advance to avoid the queue (tickets can be used any date within 14 days of the date that you initially specify on your ticket). If we strike out again and are unable to use the tickets, the refund process is no problem at all."

The car rotates so you will get 360 degree views but if you aren't at the window and you are short it will be tough to see. Also the ride only lasts a few minutes and you have to pay. If you can, I would recommend hiking up as you get the wonderful views more much longer and without the crowds. The trails are easy to follow and well maintained. Just make sure you don't go when it's really foggy.If you do take the cable car, make sure you call the number before you intend to visit as they often shut the car down due to high winds. Parking isn't too bad (it's right along the road there) but you may have to walk a few minutes."

The tickets were good for 14 days and so I booked it for our first day in Cape Town. We had met people who had been in Cape Town the week before and unfortunately for them it was closed every day due to high winds. The day we arrived and the next it was closed and we were getting pretty worried. We hung around the hotel in the morning of the 3rd day and the minute we saw that it was open we got ready to go. My husband pointed out that the web tickets I had purchased were for afternoon only. I am not sure how that happened as I had been advised that when it is open you go quickly as the Cape Town weather is so changeable, especially in the spring. I chalked it up to a bad experience and we got there and stood in the absolutely huge line for tickets. There were workers who came down the line asking if anyone had purchased tickets online. We piped up that we had but they were for afternoon only and they said \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Get in the other line\u201d. This is the line you go to when you have tickets. We stood in line there for an hour. I am sure if we had to wait to buy tickets it would have been 3. The cable car had been down for two days and we were there on a Saturday\u2026go figure. It was however well worth the wait. The ride up is amazing on the cable car with a rotating floor and the view from the top, on this very clear day was incredible. We felt so lucky that the weather had cleared so that we could visit. This was also one of our first experiences with the wonderful attitude towards tourists that we experienced in Cape Town, when no-one batted an eye when we used our \u201cAfternoon Only\u201d tickets on such a busy morning."

It seems as if the sun is dipping into the sea. I have experienced sunset in Oia in Santorini but I think this is more beautiful.

The best way to get to the top of Table Mountain is by the Aerial Cableway. The Cableway does not operate when it is very windy for obvious reasons. There are two cable cars, one going up and one going down. The cable cars are round (which we thought was odd) and not rectangular as is normally the case) We found out why - the cable car revolves on the inside affording everyone a clear view of the mountain panorama as the cable car goes up. One caution though is for you not to hold onto the window railings. If you do, you will be drawn circularly along as the cable car revolves. The operation of the cableway is fairly efficient. Some hardy travellers can decide to hike all the way up foregoing the cable way, but that option is not open to most tourists."

I was visited on a Friday, and arrived early afternoon. Parking can be challenge so be prepared to walk a bit. If you can arrange a drop off and pick up during peak times then maybe do so. remember there is parking along the road on both sides of the lower cable station. There are \"guards\" around and acknowledge them as they assist. For RSA seniors there are discounts on Fridays. At the lower station, all the staff are dressed in uniform and easy to identify. They will guide you to the ticket office, get you across the road and answer queries.I only had to wait for 1x cable car on the way up, so a few minutes to enjoy the surrounds, look at the car coming down, and anticipate the ride. When boarding the cable car, do not rush for a particular spot, as the floor rotates once the climb starts.Once at the top, there are many paths / view points to enjoy, not just Cape Town and Robben Island, but also views to Cape Point. Take water if planning a reasonable walk. There is also a restaurant at the top, so great to sit and enjoy the area with a snack.The return trip may also require a short wait, as people return. The later in the afternoon, then usually the wait is a little longer.If visiting Cape Town, then try to plan a day early in your visit so that you can have a backup day, should there be winds that prevent the cableway from operating on you original planned date.Take sun tan lotion and enjoy the experience."

It would have been nice to be offered some more shade and for staff to come around and talk to us about the wait time and to police the few people that were jumping the queue!But we knew the wait would be worth it, the ride in the cable car is great for kids and adults alike and once you are at the top, the view is breathtaking. Avoid the crowd at the exit and by the restaurant/toilet area and walk about as far as you can go. Bring a picnic (take your trash home with you) and enjoy some quiet space. Alternatively you can queue again and taste the cafeteria style restaurant.

With a feeling of apprehension, I accompanied my family to do the cable car ride up Table Mountain. On our way up the steep roads , turns and inclines included , there is no safety railing like normal roads so you will be so daunted because I know I was. But any case with all the fears and shouts and screams going up the road we finally arrived and parked on a spot with no safety railings. All you could see was the bushes and stones and town below. We got off the car and went to buy our tickets. It was a cloudy day so the attendant mentioned that we will not see much today. Any case, we waited about 15 minutes in the queue and then it was our turn. I must mention that the cable car is safe - there is place to sit for the squeamish like myself and rails to hang on to. It was a quick ride , you could see the sprawling, gigantic mountains - no wonder it was chosen as one of the Seven Wonders of the World - Table Mountain. On arrival on top of Table Mountain - which of course took my breath away, we were in awe with the beauty. The visibility was poor for a while due to rain and mist but seemed to disappear after the walk around the mountain area. I should mention I stayed away from the edges - due to my fear but want to say when the sun came out through the mist and rain - the sight was spectacular. If you want to live your dreams, now is the time to do so. Put your fears aside and live a little and enjoy the wonders of nature obviously at a price. We paid off peak price of R99.00 per person during January month - please ask for specials or you can log on to the internet and check it out.I had the time of my life. No more fear of heights. There is a quaint little restaurant if you are peckish and there is toilet facilities. Very clean and hygienic. I enjoyed every little moment and I know you will also. The staff at the restaurant are very friendly and you can take lots of photos. And I guarantee that you will thoroughly enjoy the experience."

Very lucky to get a car space that meant we avoided the arduous walk up that hill!The cable car ride provides a great view but nothing compared to the 360 degree vista from the top. As well as a beautiful mountain top walk and garden in its own right, it provides the most stunning views ..... the town itself, the beaches, those amazing mountains. The cafe isn't bad either particularly given the logistics of getting its supplies there. You haven't seen Cape Town until you have been to this site."

We had a limited amount of time in Cape Town so we decided to take the cable car to the top of Table Mountain and it was an excellent choice! I booked the tickets on line prior to the trip just to save the time and hassle. The nice thing is if you book on line and end up not using the tickets (sometimes inclement weather closes the Cable Car), you can get a refund (there's a time line restriction on refunds so just check your travel dates). You also get a discount by booking on line.We only spent about 10 minutes waiting for the cable car and the banter from the operator was amusing! The cable car rotates so it gives you a great view as you travel.See my review of Table mountain for more information."

The fee to take the cable car to the top is about $20 USD and I can tell you it is well worth it. Make sure to check the table mountain website before heading that way. Even if you have a clear day, they will close the cable car if there are strong winds. If you have a day with good visibility and low winds you need to use it to go up there! There was poor visibility or strong wind during most of our cape town visit and we almost didn't get to visit. So if you see an opportunity take it or you may miss your chance. You can also get your tickets in advance on this same website http://www.tablemountain.net. We went first thing in the morning so we didn't have any trouble, but if you can get them ahead of time why not. Note that if you get a hop on hop off pass it will take you to the base of table mountain. Otherwise, it is a pretty cheap cab ride if you are staying near the V&A waterfront. There is a great little cafe at the top of the mountain. We had breakfast here after walking around and taking some photos. The food was very good and not too expensive. I suggest about 2-3 hours here if you're going to take in the views, snap some pictures and grab a meal or some coffee."

The queue for normal tickets can mean a wait of a few hours, whereas the online ticket queue is almost a straight walk through. Unfortunately this does not allow to you to bypass the other queues. Due to the gondolas having a limited capacity there are queues to board. Generally, the earlier you can get there the better as the wind can start picking up during the day. The gondolas rotate a full 360 deg so no matter where you stand in it, you should get great views on the way up."

If you have a clear day, race to go because all the tourists will follow you. A queue of 3 hours is not uncommon! The 4 minute ride to the top is definitely worth it. The views go forever! If you suffer from vertigo, be aware....it's very high up (1076 metres or 3000 feet). Enjoy!!"

Here's my tips:On your first clear day get up very early and head to the mountainBefore you set off check the website (not matter how good the weather is in Town) to make sure the cableway is openMake sure you have plenty of time - you WILL have to queueBuy your ticket online before you set off - this will save you loads of time queuingTake water, sun block and sensible shoes - the African sun combined with the wind will dehydrate and burn you very quickly.The red line on the city sight seeing bus will take to there if you want to avoid taxi fares and problems parkingThe gondola rotates so don't worry about where you are standing you will get a mountain and a city view and some great picturesTake a picnic so you can have a walk on one on the trails up there and enjoy the view at leisureBe prepared for the fact that the 'Devils Table Cloth' and the 'Cape doctor' may conspire against youGood Luck"

Check their website before you head there and bring a jacket nonetheless. The tablecloth came rolling in as we reached the top and the temperature there is significantly lower than in the city.

When we got there it was more than 2 hours wait to purchase the tickets. Having bought our tickets online we went right through. Just make sure you go to the correct line.If you don't want to walk too far I also suggest that you park at the information/ entrance to park, at the bottom of the mountain, and take a taxi or the citybus. Just be aware that you need a card to use the bus and you cannot buy it on the bus. Taxi cost R30. There is not a lot of parking available close by if it is busy. The view at the top is incredibly beautiful. There are a few walks at the top of the mountain and you see the area from all sides.Going up, the bottom of the cable car rotates and it gives everybody a 360 degree view. The operator is very friendly and quite witty.The restaurant at the top is also very good with a nice selection of food and drinks.I think it is something you must do and worth the effort even if you have to wait for some time."

Nice views and a rotating deck so that everyone got to see all angles. Overall, the cable was nothing compared to the actual view at the top of the mountain - it is so beautiful.

Other options are the Red Hop On/Off bus, other tour groups, or by private vehicle - but be warned you'll have to park miles away and walk up to the station. The Cableway starts at 8 am, last car down is at 7 pm. Our pre-paid ticket was for a morning trip (between 8 am and 1 pm) although I don't think they're very strict about beind back down by1 pm as there are often lengthy waits. You will want to spend at least a couple of hours exploring the top - more if you elect to take the longer walks slightly off the main walkways.Booking on-line is highly recommended, as you will find yourself in a much shorter queue - but a fair wait nevertheless. Crowd control and organisation is good. There are shady umbrellas and water vapour sprays to keep you cool, but even so we saw a lot of people without pre-paid tickets forced to wait in a long line in the hot sun. Each cab can carry up to 65 people. The floor revolves very slowly (about one revolution each way). It is steep, scary and spectacular. Iconic Table Mountain can be seen from every part of Cape Town, but believe me seeing Cape Town and environs from the top Table Mountain is an experience you shouldn't miss! It's awe-inspiring.We watched enthusiastic groups of young tourists electing to abseil down the mountain - great viewing experience but I certainly wouldn't want to do it myself!There are wonderful walking paths, viewing decks and terraces all over the top of this massive plateau. Excellent information plaques about flora and fauna, topography, climate, history etc etc are scattered along the way. You can participate in a free guided tour - we listened in to snippets and they seemed informative. However using the information provided along the way should give you an excellent insight into Table Mountain.There is a very pleasant cafe/self service restaurant with inside and outside seating, as well as the ubiquitous gift shop (top and bottom of the Cableway)."

I've visited Table Mountain on two other trips to Cape Town, but this was more special as it was Christmas Day. If possible book your tickets in advance to avoid queuesThe cable car may be closed due to bad weather, and as Cape Town is prone to strong winds, this can happen quite frequently. You can always go on line or phone ahead to check if the cable car station is open. It was the perfect day on Christmas morning, not a cloud in the sky or a breath of wind. The staff wore Santa hats and it wasn't as busy as on normal days.The views are great from Table Mountain in all directions and you can spend as little or as less time as you wish. Sunsets from there are breathtaking and particuarly if the cloud comes in like a tablecloth.A perfect start to my Christmas Day."

Don't go on a busy day or a hot day or a Sunday or a holiday because if you do you will stand in the sun for hours waiting to get on the cable car. To add to the frustration, anyone who has had the foresight to buy their ticket online or any one of the crowds of people that get off the red hop on hop off bus will simply circumvent the queue and go in front of you even if you have been standing in the ticket queue for hours. Lesson. If you are going to go, buy your ticket in advance. You will still have a LONG wait but you can thumb your nose as the poor sods in the queue on the other side of the road. Once you do get to the top the restaurant is second rate, there is not enough seating and the toilets are disgusting. Disappointing really. Pick your time. A cool day, early morning or late afternoon, take water, enjoy the spectacular view. If you are young and fit try walking down. Not for the faint hearted though, thee have been deaths form heatstroke. A better booking system sorely needed. A quota system or something similar would make the experience more pleasant."

We got there around 8:30am during the week and did not have to wait to buy tickets nor to get on the cable. The views from the top are breathtaking and totally worth the $10 or $20 that they charge. Table mountain cafe is a little over priced compared to other Cape Town restaurants but still pretty cheap when putting it into perpesctive as to such a tourist area. Definitely check website the day you plan on going as the cablecars do close often due to wind, etc."

We then returned at about 3pm and found a shorter (but still long) queue. There\u2019s one line for tickets and another line for people who\u2019ve already bought them so we quickly bought some online and jumped part of the queue.The views were amazing and there were plenty of walks up on the \u2018table\u2019.

It rotates around so that you can see more than one angle of the view. It is terrific. They take your picture just before you get on & when you come down you can buy it if you want to see what you look like in a gondola. It's a fun memento. We went & I thought it might be crowded & claustrophobic but it was not like that at all. We were on the outside edge by the windows looking out & that is absolutely necessary for the view.

ZAR 215 for both ways is not too expensive and super convenient as well since it takes just 5 minutes either way. The cable car rotates as well so that no one misses any particular view from any angle while you onboard. Respect the nature when you are up there and keep it clean and do not pluck flowers etc. For me, it was certainly a great experience .. dont miss eating at the Mountain Cafe too :) If the season is not busy then you can cover the trip and come back within 2 hours as well."

There is a free 30-minute orientation tour of Table Mountain that is offered every hour and is a great way to get some basic background and lay of the land. There is a self-service restaurant with pretty decent food options at reasonable prices. Also, the souvenir shop (if you are so inclined) is reasonably priced (we saw many items elsewhere during our visit for 50-100 Rand more per item). Parking is relatively easy to find on the hillside drive en route to the Aerial Cableway. Overall, a great experience."

Table Mountain is said to be six times older than the Himalayas, having been formed under the sea some 600 million years ago. And I for one would not argue or even doubt those facts \u2013 it looked old to me!Get a cab up to the base area, buy your tickets and go up on the lift aerial cable car, which can carry some 65 people. That would be too many for me \u2013 I like to breathe and 65 others in that cable car would stifle me.But when you get up to the top \u2013 take time to walk all around and soak up the panoramic views from over 1000 metres above sea level.Then take a closer look at the flora and fauna \u2013 some 1,460 different species make up part of the Table Mountain National Park, which is the single richest floristic area in the world! Also look out for the Rock Hydrax, a dassie -the mountain\u2019s most common animal. And also the Cape Sugarbird, with its long grey tail and beak. Occasional sightings have been made on top of the black Verreaux\u2019s Eagle.Views that are sweeping really impress your eye. However walkers are in for a delight \u2013 three different signposted strolls take 15, 30 or 45 minutes to complete whilst up on the Table Top.There is a souvenir shop on the top and also a quite good buffet style restaurant where your self-selected choice of food is weighed and then charged \u2013 a unique experience for this fat traveller!I would certainly return to Table Mountain \u2013 a visual experience."

If there is low cloud round the top of the mountain you will have poor visibility from the top and do not bother going up. The locals say the \" table cloth is over the top of the table \" we saw people coming back down to complain to the ticket sellers they had seen nothing up top, showing them a digital photo of the view ( what view ?) but being refused a refund. The cable cars are very well thought out. Make sure you get a place on the outside edges irrespective of which way you are facing, as the car rotates 360 degrees during the ascent so everybody has a chance for an all round view. Once at the top, there are mapped walks around the table top. It was very very windy on the day we were there and sometimes they close the trips due to the wind. We were very cold up there.

It says that the first trip up is at 08.30, however the guides let the people in at 08.40 and at that time only counting the buses which had arrived a couple of hundred persons stood in the queue behind us and they must have purchased their tickets online as they all overtook us and rushed upstairs to the entry of the cableway. The walkway up to the entry was full of people within minutes. We still had to buy our tickets at the ticket counter and when we finally got our special tickets at the tariff of a Wild Card Member we found ourselves at the back of the queue with hundreds of other visitors in front. Very frustrating as waking up early and waiting wasn't the right thing. When we finally arrived at the entry someone from the staff members wanted to take a photo of us, couldn't understand whats going on, they did it with everyone and when asking why they want to have our picture we were told that we can purchase it when we return from the top. Sorry we refused as we do not like other people taking photos of us and the staff should inform visitors accordingly and not just say to stand still for a photograph. That's obviously a money making point in their business. We finally went up just before 10 and had a good time on Table Mountain as usual. Returning down to the station all visitors were now guided by the staff members and channeled through the souvenir shop which caused a jam and people really couldn't move. When complaining about this type of exit strategy as it is another money source to sell souvenirs a closed barrier was opened and we could leave.Management should address their staff to be polite and how to greet your customers, the first good morning was said by the man in the cable car and by nobody else, not even the ticket officer said good morning to us. In the cable car the few sitting down places close to the driver were occupied by your staff and elderly people had to stand - not good and not acceptable.However the employees at the Cafe on top were very friendly."

We booked our tickets online before our trip and it was a very easy process; the web site is well constructed and functioning.The day we had chosen turned out to be very cloudy, windy, and cool in the afternoon so we had some reservations about going up. Would we see anything? And, since the last Big Bus tour departed before we would come back down, what would we do for transport bcd to our hotel? Undaunted, we elected to go ahead anyway.The line looked awfully long but staff processed everything efficiently, so the wait was quite acceptable. Going up and through the clouds was fun, and popping out into sunshine was great. On the top we could see only the tops of mountain peaks and clouds basking in bright sunshine; what a view!!! There were good explanatory plaques at strategic positions and excellent places all around for photos and simply admiring the beauty around us. I wonder if we did not get the best conditions after all?There were plenty of cabs at the entrance/exit, and just be sure that the one you pick is metered. I don't think there is an exact, 'going' rate but our experience was that all cabs got you around within a couple of bucks of each other. The Rand has taken such a pounding that a cab ride in Cape Town is often no more than the starting fee in Toronto, Canada.We were definitely glad that we took in this attraction."

Also, if we had known this earlier in our stay, we would have made sure that we had enough time to walk up instead. What a disappointment"

The car itself turns as you ascend, to give everybody the chance to view the panorama around and below you. The guide in the car was very informative.On the downside, there was a very long wait for the cable car and whilst the owners have tried to make the wait more pleasant by installing a shaded walkway and some sprinklers / misters to keep people cool, the walkway does not extend far enough and not all of the misters were working when we visited.If visiting, make sure that you have: - Sun tan lotion, especially for any children - Hats or other forms of shade - Water or other drinks to keep hydrated while you wait.There are drinks and ice cream stalls available but you have to leave the queue to get them and they are a little more expensive than in a regular local shop."

The views from the cable car are fabulous (there is a rotating floor so you do get to see a bit of everything, but nothing beats the views from Table Mountain itself! The children had fun looking for clues to answer their quiz sheets and picked up a bit of general knowledge along the way. A bonus was the free candy (from the souvenir store) & free \"dassie\" biscuit (from the restaurant caf\u00e9) that they could pick up after handing in their vouchers.

We had debated making the hike to the top, but with only a few days in Cape Town we opted to take the speedier cable car, and I'm glad we did. The cable car was fast and easy with great views. We did not book our tickets in advance. Once at the top we enjoyed a hot morning beverage in the cafe which has a lovely view. If I had known there was a restaurant up there we'd have arrived sooner and had breakfast up there. I also think drinks before sunset there would be fantastic. There is also a gift shop up there. We took the guided walk at 10 am, they are offered hourly. It was all of 15 minutes. Some good tidbits about the mountain, but very skip-able. After the guided walk we walked the long loop ourselves, which was great. Very flat easy walk, but spectacular views and lookout points. All told we spent about 2 hours from the time we reached the mountain to the time we got back to our car. I don't see the need for anymore time than that, at least in the off season. Parking was very easy when we arrived, but it looked like it backs up a bit as the day goes on. Just be prepared to have to park a bit further away and walk."

The car itself has a rotating floor so if you rush to get on to get a specific view you will find your view changing as the floor, and you, rotates through 360 degrees. In this way everyone gets to see the city on the ride. If you have mobility problems and are concerned about a rotating floor, there are a few seats at the center of the car by the operator area that do not rotate. Your picture will be taken at some point and you can purchase it superimposed on the cable car. Once purchased they can also be downloaded to your own computer from the company\"s website."

We could tell that tour buses were lined up in masses, from below, so waited until 1:30 that afternoon. We got right in without a wait. We knew the weather near the end of May is unpredictable and the \"table cloth\" could shroud the mountain, but we had the perfect day on May 22! I cannot remember the cost but it was reasonable for what we saw on the top and the quality of time we spent. The cable car turns 360 degrees going up and you see spectacular views, but for me zip lining in Costa Rica was easier!The views of the city are gorgeous, you can see the VA Waterfront, the World cup Stadium, Robben Island, and so much.

Because you get to Table Mountain, one of the natural wonders of the world (tick), the cable car revolves around itself, so all passengers have a view of the spectacular surroundings (tick), one of the window panels has no glass so passengers can take a picture or enjoy the scenery without barriers (tick), the guys driving the car are very welcoming, lovely and informative (tick), and there are cars going up and down every five minutes (tick). If you go to Cape Town you MUST a) take the car. b) see the car from afar and take the very sought photo with the the two cards crossing. Just saying."

Tried for three days out of the five we were in the Cape Town area, to get to the top of this amazing place - and it was only thanks to my cousin - who lives there, coming with us on the third day and talking the guy into letting us onto the elevator, that we at last got there - on our very last day! We got the tickets, climbed the stairs, and for the third time, were told that the wind was getting up and cable car was cancelled - thankfully there were 17 of us waiting and my cousin stepped in and said 'who wants to go?' Everyone put their hand up, so the guy relented and off we went..When we got to the top, the wind, compared to the car park below - was incredible and it is easy to see why they have to be so careful. However, I am so pleased we were allowed up, and got an amazing unforgettable half an hour taking stunning photos and taking in the views - which were breathtaking...All I would offer as advice - is try, try again - it is well worth it. The weather may look perfect on the ground - or on the web - but believe me, it can change in an instant - you can book online but be prepared to be disappointed, and have to re arrange - so if you only have a couple of days there, prepare in advance - and take a coat!"

One of the better highlights when I travelled to Cape Town, one recommendation would be to pre buy tickets if you can as I had to wait in a line up for about 30 minutes just to get to the cable cars, although the wait was long and frustrating, the views once you got up there were amazing, there is a buffet at the top for you to feast on while you're up there as well as! Many look out points and heaps of little areas to venture in. Make sure you get photos because you won't get a better view of Cape Town anywhere else!"

The view however is amazing and going to the top of Table Mountain is a must for everyone that visits Cape Town, but I prefer the climb. I did go during easter and the queues were not really a problem."

Cape Town is known for fickle weather.....soon as the clouds clear the mountain, head for the Cable Car to view one of the most incredible and breathtaking vistas on the planet. The cable car rotates 360 degrees so everyone on board isn't glued to one window. It can be extremely cold and windy at the summit, and the \"table cloth\" or clouds can roll back in minutes. From this height you can see Table Bay, Cape Town, False Bay and most of the entire peninsula - make sure your camera is fully charged - you will want to take dozens of pictures! There are hiking paths around the summit, along with benches to sit and admire the startling scenery. As the cable car is closed frequently due to inclement weather, make sure you check via their website or with your hotel before heading up there."

At that time, there was snow on Table Mountain - a rare event as that happened not often. The sky was misty, so we could not see as far as we would like to, but it was never the less a wonderful trip. I love the fact that they took pictures of you before the trip that you can buy if you want to. It was expensive, but a wonderful something to keep to remember this experience. The ride was lovely and the mountain spectacular. When we arrived on top, it was bitterly cold and soon thereafter it started raining. Everybody scattered towards the restaurant and it was very busy inside. But, after a while we found a table and enjoyed a warm cup of coffee. When the rain was gone, we explore the mountain and saw several pouches of snow. Then we went back with the cable car.We want to go back there on a sunny day to see more of the spectacular views."

We walked up the mountain in just under 2 hours, had a very much deserved break up top, took in the views and took the Cable Car down. It was easy to buy the tickets up top, with only 2 people in the queue ahead of me. When it came time to go down, the wait was about 10-15 min, and then we were in the cable car on the way down.Tips: if you are climbing the mountain take double the water you normally would think you'd need. allow for 2 - 21/2 hrs. Bring a jumper - the weather can change unexpectedly."

Having spent a wonderful first week of our Cape Town holiday at Winchester Mansions (reviewed) we transferred to The Bloomberg apts at Camps Bay (also reviewed) We did the Cape Peninsular & Winelands tours during our first week, leaving Table Mountain until the second, for two reasons - firstly the Bloomberg is located at the foot of The Twelve Apostles, therefore only a short taxi ride away & secondly, we had been advised to pick our day, based on the weather.On a beautiful sunny morning, with a light breeze, we booked our taxi for 11am, only to discover, half way there, signs stating that the cableway was closed, due to strong winds at the top.Undaunted, if a little surprised, we opted to try again the next morning, although we did not book the taxi until we had checked the status on their website (by then we had discovered, this is regularly updated)We did not book our tickets online, hence we had to queue for about 20 mins, before joining the actual queue for the cable car - not a problem as we were in the shade. Once in the main queue it's a different story, you are climbing steps as you move along, in full sun with nowhere to sit. It's interesting to see the original old cars, positioned along the way & helped to pass the 40mins or so,waiting.Once you reach the point where the queue goes inside, you are offered the chance to have a photo taken ( with a false backdrop ) which you can then purchase on return - cost about \u00a310, includes 2 photos plus a DVD, good value for this type of thing.The queue then divides into 2 for the lifts, then everyone seems to be milling about waiting for the next car, meaning that on boarding people are appearing from everywhere, so you have to just get on, as & when you can (same on return)The car holds 60+ people, it does not revolve - the floor does! You cannot stand close to the sides so if you are short & in the middle, you probably won't see much during the 4min ride, worth bearing in mind when you board.There is a small souvenir shop on exit & a larger identical version next to the restaurant.If you intend to eat in the restaurant you spend another long time queuing & have difficulty finding somewhere to sit.There are guided tours at the top of various lengths - 30mins up to 90mins, depending on how far you want to walk ( obviously uneven & perhaps unsuitable for people with walking difficulties or pushchairs) We just wandered around, taking in the spectacular views,then queuing once more to go down. Other reviewers have already posted amazing photos & I am particularly grateful to those who did the tours & allowed me a peek at those I missed.Plentiful taxis available for the trip back to your accommodation after an unforgettable experience - well worth the R215pp"

The views of it and from it are breathtaking! The Aerial Cableway do a magnificent job of making a visit to Table Mountain pleasant and memorable. Sadly, my daughters were disappointed that there were no dassies (rock hyrax) in sight on the day we visited, but their clambering up and down the rocks and seeing a few lizards more than made up for it. The revolving floor in the cable car is a fantastic innovation. Just a wonderful experience."

However, one downside to the cable car is that during the summer they have a sunset special which is half price to do a return trip (this is a great deal), but you are unable to book the tickets online. Which means that when you arrive, you have to join a queue, which we stood in for over an hour. If you have a membership card, you don't have to stand in the queue, but as we were with overseas guests, they needed to purchase a ticket. The point being, the special is supposed to begin at 6, and at 6.10 they still had not opened the ticket office, which delays the whole process. People still have to cross the road and get into another queue which is altogether a timely matter. This meant that we only got on the cable car at 7.15, which didn't leave much time to enjoy the sunset. I therefore think they can improve the efficiency of the whole process.However, I love the cable car and the staff are fantastic, as they are always really friendly and enthusiastic about you coming to experience Table Mountain. You are allowed to take your own picnics up the mountain which is great, as once you have found a good spot at the top to watch the sun setting, the views are incredible- you won't get a better view of Cape Town!"

Otherwise, later on the queues shorten, and you can enjoy a couple hours doing a bit of wandering, and even have a sundowner, with spectacular views. This is a \"must do\" when coming to Cape Town. Depending on weather, it's best to plan this early in your visit, so you can get a visual map of the whole area - the views are stunning and vast - all the way down to Cape Point. Hint: we have wind here. If you wake up and it's windy, avoid disappointment by calling before going to make sure the cable car is running. The sun is vicious here - wear a hat and slap on that sun block frequently!"

To understand the unique structure of Table Mountain, which one can't see from the frontal approach, one needs to take the cable car to the top of the mountain and walk along the safe pathways to get an almost 360 degree view of the city and surrounding suburbs as well as Robben Island. The Dassies (closely related to the Elephant) are cute, but bite, so beware.Depending on the season, the change in temperature between the lower cable way and the top of the mountain can be quite different, so always take something warm. As the weather in Cape Town can change quite rapidly, (four seasons in one day) my suggestion is that on the first clear and windless day, your first trip should be the Table Mountain cable car. Walking up the mountain is only for the very experienced."

The rock is sedimentary and the mountain was formed by a fault. It runs several miles up the coast of S. Africa. There are several paths to take for different viewpoints on both sides. We enjoyed finding the little furry Dassie, rock rabbits, among the rocks. They and the birds were readily available for pictures. Besides the views, there are numerous kinds of plants to view.

The first time we were there in June and Table Mtn had a \"blanket\" on most of the time. This time the prominence of the mountain couldn't have been displayed more beautifully, with crystal clear, blue skies. I had been reluctant to take the cableway to the top because of the long lines and the time involved. However, the lines moved very quickly.Having purchased my ticket on-line, saving both time and money, I got directly into the queue for the aerial cableway. It took about 30 minutes to get from start to the cable-car loading area. Once at the top there were all sorts of areas for viewing the Cape peninsula in all different areas. The view of Cape Town and V&A Waterfront was spectacular. There are lots of beaches that can be seen from the top. There are wild flowers, a huge variety of Fynbos, over 2000 species on Table Mountain, making it a joy to walk on the paths.Because I was also visiting the Victoria and Albert Waterfront area that day, I allowed about 2 hours on the top before heading back to the cableway for transitioning down. That was not enough time, as one could easily spend several hours there enjoying the views, plants, birds, and other critters. It was very warm on the top as there was very little wind to cool the area...and this was in March!It took about 30 minutes to wind through the lines to get back down. I would recommend taking some snacks and water along with you. Fortunately, I took a private driver and car to the entrance so didn't have to hike a long distance up the hill. Much more time needs to be planned if you don't have a driverI highly recommend making the time to visit, particularly on a clear day. You will not be disappointed."

There is a bar so you can buy a bottle of wine and enjoy the views or have a walk about.You can walk all around the summit so you get 360 degree views which are astounding.Look out for the dassies which are like little guinea pigs.

Its very true how quickly the weather can change in Cape Town.....we were there for just under 5 days and on only 2 of them was the weather good enough to warrant going up the mountain.Buy your tickets online and they are valid for a week which means if the weather is good you can dash up the hill at any time.Buying online is also slightly cheaper than in person and will avoid some of the queues but a lot of people can't really be avoided particularly if the weather is good. However the further you walk away from the cable car area the quieter it will get.If you want to go for a walk or walk down then make sure you wear comfortable shoes...there are paths but you may want to clamber onto boulders for better views and photographs.The cable cars take 65 people at a time and are quick so queues quickly go down but its one car up as the other comes down. You may also experience queues to get down particularly around sunset a very popular time to be on the mountain.Remember to keep your ticket for your return journey and to keep an eye on the last car down otherwise you may have a long walk back...Parking is available on the road but its pretty chaotic and maybe not for the fainthearted so you may want to get the HOHO bus or take a taxi. The first car park you come to may have spaces but remember its a long walk uphill to the lower cable car station.You get amazing views of Cape Town from this road anyway so if you are short of time/money this is always an option...you just won't get the views of Camps Bay and down the penisular."

Straight away let me say that when you get up there Table Mountain is brilliant, particularly if you are one of the few who make it further than the footpath around the visitor centre. My cautionary note is about the ground station. We had to wait 3 days for the cableway to open due to wind/weather and had very little option but to go the following morning. Well, so did just about every tour company in Cape Town due to backlog! A 2 hour queue in high temperatures followed with little shade in places. There is a 2-queue system for those with and without paid tickets and I can say without doubt that it made no difference if you were in either as you end up in the same bottleneck. Staff were even allowing large pre-booked school parties to queue jump and were pretty dismissive of complaints. Moral here is go later in the afternoon if you can!"

We drove up to the mountain parked up, plenty of parking keep going to the top car parks although when in high season can be very busy, but you can drop off anyone by the main ticket office and shops if walking difficult before you park, the drive up is great. We already had tickets booked by our hotel guest relations on the web for us and no extra cost. But def recommended to do this if you can or pre book on line before you fly out as saves another queue at the sales/ticket office. Having a pre booked voucher means you can join the queue for the cable car straight away.The queue can look a bit much but it really moves quickly. There are shops before you board for water refreshments etc.The cable car is fantastic, and great staff on board giving information. The cable car rotates so you get great views on the way up. Get straight to the windows on the cable car for great photo opportunities. Once up on the mountain it is fantastic you get an amazing view over Cape Town, lots of walks and paths to take to take in the views.Great photo points too. If adventurous you may want to take try and do some abseiling...We went in March and quite warm even up that high on the mountain , wear sun screen as can easily get burnt without knowing. There is a restaurant up on the mountain easy to get drinks and food if you need and still very cheap and plenty of places to sit down and relax.Guides available that do walking tours to give you lots of information no cost.Truly a great place to visit, the mountain is really big and very relaxing taking in the lovely forms, flowers and the awesome views.

The cost of a bottle of water is super-inflated, as is the food at the top in the restaurant. The restaurant at the top is appalling. We had to queue in the sun for ages to get up, you think they could shade the waiting areas?? Up top there were just too many people, and although they tell you how valuable the flora is, there are no nature conservation people telling people not to walk wherever they wanted to. Lots of damage to plants seen. Then when we wanted to come down we got stuck, supposedly due to an Eskom power failure, but you would think this was the first time this has ever happened as they did not seem to have a clue what to do. We were half way down, when they sent us back to the top, and then had to wait an hour, although to their credit they did hand out free bottles of the most expensive bottles of water. Just very poor service, and disappointed. Would not recommend this to anyone."

We visited Cape Town in February 2014, and thought we wouldn't get the chance to go up Table Mountain as it was extremely windy and cloudy, so it wasn't possible to hike, and the cable cars were closed for 3 days! Just before we were due to fly home, the cable cars re-opened - we dashed across and managed to get tickets. We had to wait for over an hour to get up the mountain, and by this time we were very concerned that we would miss our flight. We spoke to the staff, and they rang up to the manager at the top, who arranged for us to skip the queues coming down to ensure we made our flight.....great customer service, and what a view!! The rotating floor is also very cool! Recommended!"

The Table Mountain aerial cableway is a first class operation - from the friendly staff to the smooth operation of the cable car itself.Due to the popularity of this attraction the company sometimes have to manage long queues but in my opinion they do this very well. I also think the ticket cost is very reasonable for the thrilling experience of the ride - especially considering the weak rand.This is a definite must-do when in Cape Town!"

This review is about the cable station and the car, not the mountain itself (which is amazing an should be experienced by everyone who comes to Cape Town). Please understand that most people on here mix these reviews up which does not give an accurate picture of both experiences.The trip is very over-priced and has unfriendly and unhelpful staff at the ticketing offices with very long lines beforehand. And if you want to use a student card for a discount - you can only come on a Friday (seriously!). I dont know what logic there is in that, but you will need to pay as an adult even if you have that concession.The best part of this torture is leaving the station at the top for a walk around the 3 plateaus and other trails (something which most people do not do). The worse part is knowing that you may have to use the car again if the weather becomes bad and the walk down cant be done.I know not everyone can do so, but seriously...avoid this place and climb the mountain instead (even with a gammy knee like mine, the climb is less torturous than the cableway). ...Or bring an mp3 player, so you have something to do during the long, long wait."

If you want to go up the table mountain to enjoy the really splendid view you can hike up/and or down but if this is nothing for you the only way to go is the cable car.As many people come to Cape Town and not that many do want to hike and as the cable car valley station is just next to a stop of the hop on hop off bus... there are a lot of people who want to go up and down. And even with the large cars that can lead to considerable waiting times and a longer hike to ge there if you come with your own car. Try to get a place near the window, the views are breathtaking, come evry early (before all the tourists get up) or try a late ride for the sunset. In case you do not like crowds, queues or are afraid of hights... sleave this one out."

I made sure I went on a crystal-clear day, and the views were spectacular. You can spend as much time as you like at the top, then it's an easy 2 minute ride down to the bottom in the cable car.

Also keep an eye on the weather forecast as you don't want to go up there when there is low cloud as you wont see anything!"

We decided to go to Table Mountain to celebrate a birthday, however due to high winds the cableway was closed, so do check the weather and online web site before heading for the cableway. That said we booked our tickets online the day we eventually decided to go (that will save you time queuing for tickets when you arrive and you can go straight to boarding) as this will save you up to 90 mins in peak times. The cabin holds about 50 people and I recommend getting on first or last so you are at the edge of the cabin. The cabin rotates so great views of the surrounding area as you proceed to the top. On reaching the top there is a walkway around and gives great views of the coastline around Cape Town and beyond and plenty of photo opportunities. If you have binoculars, take those too. There are some cafes on the top for a beer or soft drinks and some food. I would allow up to 45 mins to tour the top and then head back down to the Waterfront for drinks/food. A must in Cape Town"

The car revolves as you go up so everyone gets a view of the city below and the rock face of the mountain. It can be very busy particularly at weekends so parking is often a challenge. More by luck than judgement I timed it to be able to see the sunset which was truly stunning but keep an eye out for the time of the last cable car down. I bought my ticket on line before I left the UK just in case the queues were as bad as I'd read, but it was fine (if you don't use it you can get most of your money back). It closes for bad visibility and high winds so worth keeping an eye on their website <http://www.tablemountain.net/> If you're the last ones down and hence dark when you get to the bottom, look up at Signal Hill and watch the lines of walkers coming down with their head torches on.

Then we went to the line, a long, long line to take the cableway. We stood at the line for 45 or 50 minutes, under a hot sun. When we entered the car, it was good, the car is modern and the temperature inside was good. I did not counted, but I believe that the car bear more than 50 persons each trip.The descent was fast, a few minutes, and the car rotates, so you get a 360\u00ba view of the town and the mountain.The cableway is fine, but to wait at the long line was tough."

After postponing our trip with the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway due to poor weather, we decided to take our European tourist friends up the following day. This was a typical perfect-weather day in Cape Town in December and a Sunday to boot. The queue was enormous; Luckily we had booked our Cableway tickets online (a few easy clicks) and were able to skip a large portion of the queue. An additional bonus: We took a taxi, which was only able to reach the bottom of Tafelberg Road (which had been closed off due to heavy traffic). As we started our slow, long walk up the road, we were intercepted by small Tuk-tuk-like carts, which gave us all a shuttle lift up to the lower cable station - at no charge!The queuing still took us approximately another two hours - I assume thousands of people moved through those gates on that day. Staff was moving about the crowds queuing, who managed the flow of the crowd (always with good humour and lots of patience) as well as a Clown making balloon animals and a Faerie princess doing face-painting, to keep the young ones entertained. Heat was controlled by refreshing mist-sprayers. A little temporary kiosk had also been established inside one of the old Cable Cars on display, and we were able to buy some refreshments to keep up our energy and good spirits.At the top, we spent most of the time at the restaurant while our German friends roamed the majestic mountain top, admiring the views from all the different angles. We had a lovely lunch and some crisp wine (both food and drinks are offered in a decent variety and the \"self-service\" concept is brilliant, as it seems to be the best way to accommodate very large numbers of visitors).We were very proud to be Cape Townians on that day, showing off not only our beautiful city and it's surrounds, but also the superb service and facilities available.THANK YOU to the entire Table Mountain Aerial Cableway team that made that day unforgettable! Looking forward to doing it all again soon!"

We were there on New Year's eve, and had decided to walk up and get the cable car down. It was mobbed! Half of CapeTown had decided to visit the mountain that day too.. To be fair the organisation of the staff was excellent, and bearing in mind the number of people they had to shift, it wasn't too long standing in the queue. Only about 1 hour 40 mins.. (People we spoke to had waited 3+ hours to get up!) However, the ride itself for me was a complete let down. I was expecting a 20 min ride, but it was about 2 mins. I know the cable car rotates as you go down, but the views aren't any better than you get from the road or the top of the mountain. It is a perfectly good form of transport, but certainly not the tourist attraction I had thought it would be. (and it's very expensive!)"

The ride is quite short approximately 3 minutes and the floor of the car rotates so you get a 360 degree view as mentioned by all other reviewers. I personally would advise that you book tickets in advance online to avoid the ticketing queue so that you can head straight to the cable car queue. We were lucky that we managed to get to the top on the day that we had booked on a bright clear sunny day and did not experience any cancellations due to high winds etc as experienced by other reviewers but do check the forecasts before going to the base station.The queues were long on the day of our visit - we arrived at 10.30am and we waited for 1.5 hours at the bottom and 45 minutes at the top so be prepared for the waiting/queueing.Otherwise, do not miss this opportunity while visiting Cape Town."

We had to wait 30 minutes for the ticket office (mostly in the shade), then another 50 minutes for the cable-car in baking sun. Even if we had online tickets we would stil have had to wait for the cable-car though. The parking was chaotic - I don't understand why they haven''t built a car-park rather than relying on parallel parking along a narrow road. Anyway, we eventually got to the top and the setting and the views were truly spectacular. There is a reasonable self-service cafe at the top, but it was very disorganised and by the time we paid for our food it was cold. Based on my experience, my advice would be to buy tickets in advance, try to avoid busy times if possible (early morning and late afternoon are much quieter), but this is an opportunity not to be missed."

The car rotates, so everyone gets a look out as you ascend and descend. Lines can be very long as others have noted, and weather changes rapidly, so I'd try going early in the day and buying advance tickets if you're going at a popular time. It's very very important to pay attention to the weather when you are up on top. The fog comes in blindingly fast and the cable car stops running - so listen for the klaxon. They remind you about this on the way up, but it's amazing how many times people get stuck - which is not fun as others have noted."

Due to windy conditions, it was closed for a couple days straight. It was also Christmas season, which didn't help. We decided to do the afternoon time slot as we had to go to Christmas mass. We bought tickets online thinking this would guarantee admission as tickets do sell out..But that it may be also faster. When we arrived at 12:20 PM, the line was already all the way to Timbuktu. There was two lines, one with tickets and one without. The web site says \"why wait in line when you can buy tickets online.\" This may hold true during non-holidays but the lines for both were long. The line for the non-ticket holder seemed to be moving faster. In the end, both line merges so you wait regardless.Now when we get to the top of the mountain, there is a cafe. The food was pretty good, but the experience was less then relaxing. It was mayhem to get into the lines and food was \"made to order.\" Why can't they just have things ready to go? This made the wait longer. When I was ready for ice cream, I had to get back into the long line again.On to the experience at the top: It was for sure a breath taking view. After you get out of the crowded cafe, there was different walks (or hikes) you can take. You see views of the city, of Lion's Head, of the Twelve Apostles and Devil's Peak. I recommend getting a better picture of Twelve Apostles during the drive to Hout Bay. The cable car ride was fun and it rotates so you get a different view as you get up. My whole visit took four hours for this attraction and after it was done, we had no energy for anything else. It was a must-see however, so if you come during the busy season, be ready to endure the long lines and crowds."

During the high season, the cable car ques are long (pre-booking on the internet).The 2 cars will take just under 20 minutes and will do a full 360degree turn before it reaches the summit. Once on top, walk along (stay on the guided/ marked pathways) as one can stray & believe me, if the fog horn blows, it is time to take cover at the entrance. There are 'dassies (relative to the..yes it is true - Elephant) small to medium sized looking moles. Don't feed nor touch them as they do bite! You can also walk up n down the mountain, but i would advice that you do more research before trying it out.The view over the city bowl and harbour, stretches from the west to the distant Hidelberg mountains (stunning famous wine land-Stellenboshc, Paarl,Franschoek, Somerset West to Strand and Gordans Bay) over False bay towards (back of the mountain) Cape Peninsular/Point with the famous Navy base-Simons Town, 12 Apostles and the very wealthy Clifton, Sea-Point with its million dollar homes..There is the famous Eagles Nest restaurant that offers food n beverages on top. I was once stranded for 3h due to thick fog, but endured it well as the food n wine flowed. You will never forget this magical moment. Everyone that visits Cape Town must visit Table Mountain & Stellenbosch. The capital of wines in Africa. End May-August is our wettest season with a sub-mediterranean scale! The mountain lights go off at midnight during high season. Enjoy and let me know if this has been helpfull!"

Our wait in line was nothing compared to those who were waiting to buy their tickets. Be sure to wear sun screen and dress comfortably. We decided against hiking after reading reviews. Unless you're an expert hiker, just enjoy the gondola ride. We purchased a bottle of sparkling wine and some munchies to enjoy at the cafe. Watch out for the birds. They are sneeky and quite bold. We then walked around to explore and take our pictures. It's breathtaking!"

This is great, as everyone gets a chance to stand next to the window. watch out when the cable car is about 2/3 of the way up as the view is just amazing. If you are on a budget travel, then try the sunset cable car(after 6) as the price is halved then. During summer this is a very good offer as the last trip down is at 8 PM. And you can catch the sunset as wellHowever if you want to visit during the day only, then please prebook as it will save you 10% of the costalso there is a free walk around tour at the top (every hour from 10:00 to 3 PM) everyday , where the guide can tell you some interesting stories"

If tickets aren't pre-booked there can be a lengthy wait at the ticket desk (especially if the cable car has been closed for weather the previous day). There might also be a rush onto the cable car to get window space facing the best direction - but fear not (!) the cable car rotates 360 degrees on the way up enabling all window-side spaces to get a great view. Its possible to get a one way ticket and walk down, either back to the base station or across the 'table top' to Kirstenbosch."

The approximately 3000 feet trip to the mountain top is accomplished by a cable car that can hold about 65 people. The number of people, though, does not hinder one from the seeing the sites during the +/-10 minute ascent thanks to the car's revolving floor. As a passenger, you are guaranteed a 360 degree view. Once you exit the car, you are free to walk along the many trails atop Table Mountain. The views are spectacular, from the Atlantic Ocean to the hustle and bustle of Cape Town and even the distant snow-capped mountains. There is a restaurant; a place to pick up a drink or snack; and several places to sit and relax during your time on top. The cable car only operates during optimal weather, so don't \"save\" this for the last day of your Cape Town visit. If the weather is good, GO! While a clear day will always afford you spectacular views, the best time to go is around sunset when you can watch the sun slowly disappear below the horizon."

We were a group of 11 with 5 small children, so flexibility was a must and Sean was gracious enough to accommodate all of our needs. Every site was gorgeous in Cape Town will never be forgotten. Table Mountain was so gorgeous as well as the many other views that we were shown (Cape Peninsula Tour, Chapmans Peak, Simon's Town). We went on a day where the wind or rain wasn't a factor and had the most amazing time. We didn't have enough time or energy to take the hike up but I'm sure it would've been an unforgettable experience as well. Lastly please take advantage of learning of the great history and culture in Cape Town (District Six Museum, Slave Museum, and Bo Kaap Museum, Mama Africa and a soccer game). We are forever changed by our experiences in S. Africa. Thanks again Joleen and Sean!"

But it is all worth it, the views are spectacular as you get a 360 degree vantage point of Cape Town. We took our own picnic lunch with us and we had that on the mountain. I would suggest this, as the cafe at the top of the mountain can be pricey. When we got to the top it was pretty windy, so I would suggest always take a warm jacket and pants with you, even if its 27 degrees celcuis below, on the mountain it can drop to 18 degrees celcuis. I recommend wearing sunblock as well. To avoid some of the queuing time, I suggest you buy your tickets online at www.tablemountain.net, you'll only have to queue to get the cable car up the mountain. But it is definitely worth the views and scenery of Cape Town. I would also suggest you go early in the morning, as the weather tends to change in the afternoon. We were one of the last groups to make it up as the wind was getting to much to allow more people up."

We arrived at 10h30 and were totally daunted by a \"two hour\" queue in the hot sun, so instead we went off on the red bus, did the city tour then returned to the mountain at around 15h45 - perfect. A short queue, a cool breeze and we had a lovely visit."

If possible, get an online ticket up front, otherwise even being there at 8 means a wait time (but bearable, we waited about 20 min in early November). When we came down around 12, the lines were amazing!Check the weather! Even going up on a clear day can mean you are covered in clouds in no time. On days with mediocre weather the cable car is often even suspended. So check the weather up front and check the cable car\u2019s website for updates on the weather at the top.Do the summit hike! Although we used the cable car to get up there, we still wanted to get some exercise, so we tried the hike to the summit (Maclear's Beacon, about 2 hour round-trip), great!"

She is extremely knowledgeable and attended to every detail, including pick-up and return to airport, booking our hotel and reservation for dinner on the Wharf, escorting us to Table Mountain, driving us to dinner and ensuring that our table was perfect and taking us back to our hotel, all the first day. Table Mountain is spectacular! We saw it with the mist, clouds, and with a clear view of the city below--was great to experience it with all those elements. The cable car was convenient and safe. The Wharf is a buzz of activity for shopping, dining outside and walking around. Linda drove us to Hermanus for whale watching the next day. What an experience to be on a catamaran in the Atlantic Ocean and see many, many whales, followed by a marvelous lunch in Hermanus on the water!! She also drove us to Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope, with stops at an ostrich farm and a penguin colony! Linda ensured that we saw what we wanted to and stayed as long as we wanted . . .for a very reasonable fee! Take camera, walking shoes, binoculars everywhere as much of the sightseeing mentioned took full days. Cape Town is beautiful with both the mountains and ocean and Linda will help to make it an unforgettable trip!!"

For someone is teriibly afraid of heights I managed this one without too much fuss. They have an extrememly secure pod that takes you from the base of Table Mountain to the top in a not-too-long-but-not-too-short-that-it-becomes-pointless space of time. The view is phenomenal and the service is world class. If you're going, take heed of two things: 1. Check online to see if the car is operating - the cable car will be closed if conditions are too dangerous. 2. Book online so you don't have to queue in the ticket line.If it's your birthday, the Aerial Cableway company will give you a complementary return ride on the cableway within a week of your birthday passing (to account for dodgy weather conditions).The pod revolves so don't get to comfortable knowing that you're not sitting by a window. It will come arround to you at least 3-4 times before you reach your destination.The only reason this attraction is rated 5 is that it's objectively a little expensive for locals and definitely seems geared towards deep pocketed tourists. That being said, locals can get an annual pass if they want to. It works out a bit cheaper if you plan on going fairly regularly."

Two recommendations: get near the window for the best views, and try to go in the late afternoon (although do check that the weather looks OK since it can't run in high winds)."

Hiking is awesome but it takes time and you need to be fit enough to do it. The cable car is an easy way to get to the top. On the day, check if the cable car is open as it is weather dependent - the wind is unpredictable and gets hectic here in Cape Town. Plan about half a day for this visit. You can do it in an hour or so, but it's nice to spend some time relaxing and enjoying the views from the top. There are 2 queues one to buy the tickets and one to actually get on the cable car. In Summer, these queues are quite long, so plan carefully, be there early or try for later in the afternoon. If you're a local I recommend getting a cable card so that you can go up regularly. To the visitors, I recommend buying your tickets online in order to avoid the queues to get the tickets. The cable car takes 65 people up, so during peak times it was be a little full in there. The highlight of the trip up is that the floor rotates so you actually see quite a view on your way up. I like to spot the hikers, joggers and climbers as we go up. It takes 3 minutes to get to the top. Wear comfortable shoes, so that you can walk around the top. The one section is neatly paved. Another section is more \"rustic\" but still easy to walk. It takes about an hour to walk the whole top section - this includes all the stops to take photos. There are shorter routes. Take a warm jacket, even if the weather looks great. The weather is slightly different on top and it changes very quickly. I also recommend taking a hat & sunscreen. Obviously take your camera, the views are incredible. The sunsets are amazing. You may even see some smaller wild life (dassies). If you're hungry and didn't pack a picnic. The Table Mountain Cafe is nicely situated. You can get sit down meals or take away meals. I recommend the milk tart. If you packed a picnic, there are lots of interesting spots that you can enjoy your meal and the view at the same time. One for my favourite spots is the Shop at the Top - they have interesting items especially to buy as gifts. I really like that they are so reasonably priced. At the bottom, there is a kiosk where you can buy water and food - handy if you have to wait while in the queue. It's just been revamped so check it out. There are also a few shops at the bottom where you can buy gifts, etc. The staff wear bright green tops making them easy to spot and are super friendly. So if you need anything or have questions, just ask them. Their website is very informative and has some specials too. Enjoy the ride and the views."

We hardly had to queue at all on arrival at about 10.20am as it is out of peak season at the moment. The cablecar to the top was fantastic, it rotates so everyone gets a view both up and down the mountain at some point. The views from the top are amazing, although remember it is windy at a height so bring a coat. We had a lovely light lunch in the caf\u00e9 up there, sitting looking out over the bay. We were able to post a postcard in the postbox on top of the mountain which was pretty cool. No wifi which was a shame, would have been brilliant to be able to \u2018check-in\u2019 to table mountain. There are a good selection of reasonably priced gifts for sale in the caf\u00e9/shop at the top. Definitely worth a visit \u2013 the views are amazing."

Only do this on the way down to save your knees (assuming you are able bodied) as the queues can be horrendous (1.5 hours for us but admittedly one car was broken that day) and you are rammed in like cattle for a 3 minute journey. Very much the anti-climax compared with the exhilaration of some good hard physical effort on the way up and the breathtaking views* and beer at the top (*on a clear day of course)."

It's easy to get to, not overly expensive and could literally be the high point of your holiday. Weather conditions can cause the attraction to be closed. But if it's a spur of the moment visit and you can see the top from the ground, you should be ok.The journey to the top is via a revolving cable car which means everyone gets a good view of the surroundings. Clever thinking on that one.Once at the summit you can stroll at leisure and take in superb views. There is a cafe if you're in need of refreshment and pricing is very reasonable. God knows how much you would pay at a similar venue in good old 'Rip Off' Britain.Once you're done and back at the base the pre taken photos of yourselves are available for viewing and or purchase. (No pressure though) a little expensive I thought, but well shot and packaged plus an accompanying disc containing the digital copies and other info.Walking/Hiking up or down is an option but should be carefully organised as the conditions and weather are key factors to the success or otherwise of the venture.All in all an absolute 'must do'"

Once up there enjoy the views and have a bite to eat, then take Cable Car Down, Cost R110 (approximately $11). If unfamilair with hiking route rather go with a group or with a guide. However, if you don't have enough time or not much into hiking, then take the cable car up and down, Cost for return ticket R220 (approximately $22), discounts possible for children and pensioners. Some Advice; always take extra warm jacket or coat with, as there is always temperature diffirence below and on top, thus even if its a very warm day, still take warm clothes with in a bag."

The last time I visited the cableway was a good 25 years ago, when the cable cars were still open and nobody actually knew what health and safety stood for. I was expecting this visit to be over touristy and the mountain top to be over developed now with the recent flux of tourism to the country since the world cup. I was pleasantly surprised, the \"new cable cars\" are much more spacious, faster and safer than the older ones, and to my surprise the mountain top facilities and hiking trails are the same as they were 25 years ago still giving a certain wildness and authenticity to the trip to the top, the ticket price could be cheaper considering the amount of people they are able to take to the top of the mountain in each cable car but all in all well worth the visit!"

The weather changes quickly and it can be cold at the top, so be prepared. Also, the queues can get quite long, sometimes taking an hour to come down. There is a caf\u00e9, a gift shop and restrooms at the top. Another option: you can hike up and take the cable car down. That gives you many stunning views on the way up. We did that. We took the easier trail, Platteklip Gorge, and it took about 2 hours. It's not particularly easy - there is some scrambling involved, but if you like to hike, take it slowly and enjoy it. "

Rather take the time and hike up the mountain... yes it takes longer... but once you are up, the view is even more rewarding..."

            "review": "Up, up and away (round and round) you go. Background: Starting from Tafelberg Road, this aerial cableway ascends the side of Table Mountain, a World Heritage Site and South Africa's most famous landmark.PROS: Location... location... location is its best asset. It sits adjacent to Table Mountain, fits about 5 dozen people and takes roughly 5 minutes for it to climb to the top. After queueing for about half-hour, we got to ride. Fortunately, instead of lining up, tickets can be pre-bought online and at a cheaper price, too, like \u00a312/person round-trip or \u00a37/person one-way. (Minors are about half-price, while kids under 4 years old are free.) No need to fight for a specific window view either because, as it ascends, it does a slow 360-degree turn to offer riders an excellent view overlooking Cape Town and a panoramic view of the surrounding scenery. There is something for everyone. For the shutterbug, at the summit are unbelievable vistas and countless photo ops. For families, the place is kid-friendly. There are free guided nature walks and the guides are very knowledgeable. For the famished hiker, there's a small caf\u00e9 at the top. For the shopaholic, a souvenir gift shop, of course.CONS: There could be long lineups at the ticket counter as well as the parking lot, both of which we experienced. That's 30 mins of lost time. (In hindsight, I should've bought tickets online.) Although typically Mediterranean in climate with hot, dry summers (Dec-Apr) and cold, wet winters (July-Oct), the cablecar ride is local weather-dependent. Operating only when weather permits, it may close down on very windy days. Needless to say, if you are acrophobic, take a pass.Tip: Some people have opted to hike up and down Table Mountain rather than use the cablecar. That's fine, too, but the 3km posted distance can be misleading as the terrain is steep. The climb is physically challenging but the hike is worthwhile, and the excursion is within the ability of most reasonably fit people. The monotony of the hike is offset by the number of panoramic vistas along the way. As a viable compromise, you can take the cablecar up and then hike down.Verdict: One of the best views I've seen, maybe ranked just behind the Peak-2-Peak Gondola between Whistler and Blackcomb Mountains in Canada, and ahead of the cablecar between Italy and Switzerland. I'm not sure who has the best views: the riders or the hikers but, in either case, it's a win-win situation. Recommended. Grade A-minus.."

So the best way to avoid a 3 hour queue is to decide that you'll go on the very first fine day (when the cableway will be open-sometimes it's closed due to the weather). Get there nice and early, 8 or 8.30 if possible, having already purchased your ticket on line, which means you can jump one of the queues. Get a taxi (not very expensive) or drive yourself. Don't rely on the Jump On Jump Off bus as you'll get there too late and you'll get caught in a traffic jam. Then have breakfast when you get to the top. The food isn't fantastic but it's great to sit and look at the sights while you eat (be careful the birds don't steal your food!). Then you can take your time to wander about - allow several hours. The cableway down doesn't seem to have long queues. I went in peak season so the queues might not be so bad off season, however the chances of it being closed are greater."

The cableway takes you from the lower cable station to the upper station in a few minutes in a large cable car that takes up to about 60 people (be sure to position yourself near a window). The floor revolves, giving you a 360-degree view of Cape Town and the front face of Table Mountain.Once at the top, there are lovely walkways which are suitable for prams and wheelchairs, but also longer routes through the fynbos if that's what you're looking for. There's also a restaurant with breathtaking views, and a lovely little \"Shop at the Top\" for a special Table Mountain or Cape Town souvenir.You'll probably be thirsty at the top - so take something with you or buy it there. A lovely thing to do is to take your own picnic, find a spot with a view behind a large rock, and spend as long as you like. The weather can change quickly on top and can be different to the rest of Cape Town, so it's usually a good idea to take a jacket with you.And the best tip of all - buy your tickets online beforehand at www.tablemountain.net. Not only do you get 10% off, you also stand in a much shorter queue, which can be a huge advantage on a busy day."

Looking at what it does - that is to take people on top of one of the most remarkable natural wonder of the world, the cable way is not treated as part of the enjoyment of going up the Table Mountain. The reason I say this is that due to the high demand by people wanting to go up, it is resorted to getting people up and down the mountain as quickly as possible. It travels 1 Km at a time but the journey lasts only 10 minutes and you are there from the bottom to the top in no time. It does not allow time to take the view of the city, the mountain and the valley in. Fair enough, it rotates as it climbs but it rotates so quickly that you can't \"take the view in\". A nice slower journey would have been better. Still, it is the only way up to the Table Mountain for most of us. "

The views from the mountain is breathtaking, but make sure that you go on a cloudless day, as very often the clouds are quite low and it is not possible to see everything. Wear comfortable shoes as you can walk quite far on top of the mountain, and remember to bring something warm to cover up. The weather can change very quickly towards the afternoon (as happened with us). We had a delicious lunch at the restaurant with some having pizza and others having salad. There is also a wide variety of beverages available. We chose to sit outside and enjoyed the view so much that we actually spent longer at the restaurant than intended. It was a very enjoyable trip and we will definitely go again.Tip: Go early in the morning as it can get very crowded."

There are plenty of opportunities elsewhere. The car ride is taken standing and the windows rotate around. No grabbing on anywhere is allowed due to the rotation needed. It is a really unique system. Up at the top are a souvenir shop, restaurant, and look-out points. Be sure to walk all around for sea, Robben island, and city views.Recommended."

Don\u2019t book in advance. You could chooes a foggy day, or \u201da table cloth day\u201d.2. Be there right when it starts. Then there will be NO queues (unless everyone reads this review). Also between 2pm and 4pm are less queues.3. If you are retired, go there on a sunny, beautiful Friday! Then it\u2019s half price for retireds.

Take plenty of sun block and a hat if you anticipate having to queue - the line exposes you to the sun at some points. Look for discounted vouchers if you are attending an event in Cape Town - we were part of the Cape Argus Cycle ride and we found a \"2 for 1\" offer in the brochure - a really good saving although you might have to queue to redeem it. Ensure you stand close to a window in the cable car and be prepared for the floor slowly rotating so that you can get a 360 degrees view - awesome. We regret that we did not make enough time to take advantage of a guide - these guys know their stuff and will help you to make sense of the panorama in front of you. C'est magnifique, by the way. We were disappointed that the official photograph was not ready for us when we descended - i guess we didn't loiter at the top long enough. You need to give it about 1 hour between ascending and descending. If you atre wheelchair bound, there are decent pathways that are wide enough for a chair. if you need a loo break at the top, I only spotted one and that was not at the entrance/exit to the cable car. it is situated at the restaurant. If you are getting a cab back to town decide in advance if you want to hang around in one of the people carriers whilst they attract more fares - it is probably cheaper than a standard cab but you might have to wait up to 15 minutes whilst the drives tries to persuade others to join you. Choose your day to go by becoming a bit of an anorak with the weather reports - mist and fog are a big \"no no\". if yu have flexibility, Carpe Diem when the weather is good;"

My friend rang the official tourist board to find out that day's operating hours, as they can be variable depending on weather. A nice gentleman told her last car up was 630pm and last down was 730pm. We were thrilled to get to see the sunset. We all bought tickets online @205 rand per person.When we arrived at the base at 5:35pm we were told they had shut it down we asked why, they said closing was at their discretion. we asked to speak to a manager and a duty manager, Craig Hotnaut (sp?) came and angrily told us there was no chance we could be taken up, that our tickets were worthless and that we should \"just get over it\". He said he had tweeted the earlier closing time (why would tourists check that??) and that the man we spoke to on the phone had been wrong. His attitude was egregious, his lack of compassion astounding and his arrogance almost overwhelming. If Craig is the face and manager of one of Sth Africas most important tourist attractions, then it will be very hard to recommend ever visiting the country, despite all of its charms. We were not the only group to be left high - sorry low- and dry and his lack of empathy and general disdain for excited tourists ruined the entire day for our whole party. Shame on him and shame on Table mountain management. Lets hope the staff at robben island tomorrow are not so disgusted by having to do their job.

We went on the marked trail on the top and went down some steep steps, but all still on the trail. There was a young black guy and a woman in her mid 40's that looked out of place. We greeted them and he wasn't friendly at all. She acted as if she was really struggling to get down the path. They moved on ahead. When we reached them, he came up behind my daughter and we realized that we were in trouble. Fortunately, another couple came by and we got out of there quickly.

From atop the Table Mountain, on one side you can see the entire city and other side you can see the ocean. Its 3500 feet and can be cool in the evenings, although you get to get up there only on clear days. Otherwise the rope way is not open to go up. The charges for the rope ways are R205 but if you go post 6pm, its R100! You may have to stand in the line for 30 minutes for your turn for the cheaper pass. Make sure you have some food, camera, pullover and you are set! Its a romantic place and a magical moment when the sunset is happening. If you plan to go for the sunset, make sure you check out all the points first before the sunset then settle down at a place with a good view for the sunset. The food and drinks available up are expensive so advisable to carry your own."

You get to see the city with light, then you get to see the sun go down behind the see and then, you get to see the city in the night, with all the beautiful lights on! 3 in one!!!- If you are in CT for a few days, try schedulle Table Mountain for the beginning, as it can get windy frecuently and then, the cable way closes often. If you can't do it the first time you try, you can postpone for next day and so on. If you leave it for last and happens that day is closed, you'll miss out!"

Room for Wheelchairs and electric scooters in Cable Car. Very smooth ride. We went on a baking hot day (over 90 degrees), no wind, and no clouds, so the top of the mountain had no \"cloth\" on. We were extremely fortunate to choose a clear day and no winds. It is wise to contact the mountain staff before you go, as winds can often force closure. When we got to the top of the mountain, (my parents, carer, and I) were told that had we contacted them the day before, I would have been able to abseil down part of the mountain in a wheelchair, but obviously, we couldn't guess at the weather in advance on the top of the mountain. When the africans saw a wheelchair (for my mother) and my electric scooter, they carried them (yes carried) up some steps to the top of the mountain! We did not expect that!Yes, you are packed in the Cable Car, but there is a fair amount of space. Table Mountain is not wheelchair friendly (and probably never will be) but it was an experience I would not have missed. grab the opportunity when it comes!At the bottom of the mountain, there are souvenir shops and toilets. As my carer spoke Afrikans, he would often get the price knocked down, which was very handy!"

The cable car is certainly unique in that the car rotates so that you get a 360 view while en route. HOWEVER, these folks are not good at communication or running a line (please hire Disney). When we first got in line, we had to stand in the queue across the driveway from the ticket office. When they paused the rides for weather, we got out of line for a while and had a soda, etc. When we returned to get back in line, we went back to the same queue which is under cover (and confusingly has 2 lines embedded there). After sitting in that line for about 30 minutes and not moving, we noticed other people were walking right up to the ticket counter and skipping the queue. I asked the staff why those folks did not have to be in line. At this point, the staff said the covered queue was no longer the ticket line, but the delayed ticket line for half price evening tickets...despite the fact that there was no signage and it was the same line we had been in previously where they lined up all ticket buyers. After fuming a few seconds, we jumped into the regular line and were going up the mtn 5 minutes later. Just be sure you have patience for both the weather and the staff."

You will usually have to wait in line for some time to buy your tickets for the cableway but it's worth it. Try to go on a day when the sky is clear so that you can enjoy the spectacular views from the top of Table Mountain. There are many paths to walk along at the top of the mountain and you can look down over Cape Town from the top from several view points. There is a nice restaurant on the top of the mountain and you can buy food and drinks. The sandwitches we bought there were delicious and you can even buy a glass of wine. There is also a nice shop on top of the mountain so that you can buy some items regarding Table Mountain and Cape Town. I bought some nice T-Shirst with pictures of Table Mountain and the Cableway as well as Cape Town and South Africa. You can buy some nice souvenirs at the shop on the top of the mountain or another one at the bottom next to the ticket counter. Don't forget to bring your camera and video camera to take pictures while going up and down the cableway and also the stunning pictures you can take from the top of the mountain. We spent five hours there, taking our time, walking along several paths at the top of the mountain and looking down from the top from several different spots. If you come to Cape Town this is a must go to place when you visit Cape Town as a tourist. The Cablecars floor actually rotates 360 degrees while you are going up and down, so that you can see the view from different angles. When you get into the cablecar, try to stand at the side facing the glass windows, so that you can get a good view while going up and down. Don't rush while you or up at the top of the mountain, try to walk along all the different paths at the top and enjoy the scenes looking down from the top to the bottom from different angles. Try not to go when its too cloudy otherwise you won't be able to enjoy the view as much. Try to choose a day when you have clear blue skies or mostly clear skies so you can take advantage of the view while you are looking over Cape Town from the top of Table Mountain."

But, when i arrived there, it was totally different. i could see not only town but also the Atlantic Ocean. The Ocean was very beautiful and blue. Furthermore, the stiffs of the Mountain was amazing. The entrance fee was around 50 Rand, it was worth for paying. The mountain was very impressive and unforgettable in my life."

This is not the first time I moan about this and something should be done about it.

It also allows you to take shots of the mountain and the view across to Robben Island. The tablecloth kept coming and going sometimes obscuring the 12 apostles, but the views were magnificant.

You will feel the balance of yin and yang and the vibrant energy on this mountain. Captivating views and the table cloth as the air condenses,the trip is somewhat a homecoming for the soul. A great restaurant and curio shop are both at the top. It can get very crowded and you may easily miss the spiritual essence of what this landmark has to offer as you may stand in queues exceeding 3 hours for a trip in a cable cart ascending and descending. A hike would be best but if you are short of time make sure to get your tickets online,this would save you an hour or more."

The cable car offers a quick and easy way to get to the top of table mountain for those who cannot do the hike up, or for those who have done the walk up but are too tired to trek back down. The car rotates, so as long as you are standing by the glass, you will get great panoramic views. However, be aware that the cable car closes regularly due to high winds and table mountain is often under heavy cloud cover. Check the table mountain website for updates on wind speed and visibility to avoid being disappointed. Get there early - as soon as the cable car opens at 8 a.m. - to avoid long lines and to enjoy the mountain top in some peace before everyone else arrives. Wear sensible shoes if you plan to walk around the top. Also, bring a windbreaker, you will be thankful. You can also choose to do a hike to McClear's Beacon for views from the other side. Beware if the siren sounds, that means the cable car will be closing soon due to high winds. There is a restaurant, restrooms, and a gift shop on top."

Love it..... great views."

Wonderful views if you are near windows not so good if lost in the scrum in the middle. Good service although by its very nature there is usually a queue. Often closed because of the weather - especially the wind. If your time in Cape Town is short take first opportunity to go up. Many people miss their chance and go home disappointed."

Both adventures are wind and weather dependent. Table Mtn was closed 3 out of 7 days we were here due to high winds or cloud cover. Robben Island ran each day and luckily we went on a day with mild seas.The cable car tickets are good for a 14 day period so your plan should be to be flexible enough to go as soon as the weather is nice. Mornings looked to be less crowded. Your ticket doesn't have a specific time. We took a cab from the waterfront (EBR. 021 424 9494) for about 60 Rand, about $8. We had an estimate of 150 rand from a guy who claimed to be a taxi. For the Robben Island power catamaran, (250 people - 30 minute trip), if the wind is creating dangerous conditions they'll call your hotel an cancel, but if it's only \"sickening\" conditions you'll have to decide on your own. Get in line for security 15 minutes early to get on the top, or outside decks. If you come late you'll be trapped inside the stuffy cabin. Using just the one cab company turned out to be a good idea. Restaurants would call them for us an they'd get us back to The African Villa where we stayed with no hassle. Going from the District 6 museum to the Clock Tower, an easy tourist path, turned out complicated for a cab marked \"metered\" on the outside but without a meter on the inside."

A drop-off zone at the cable station would also be convenient for people to drop off their companions, go to park the car and shuttle back on the golf carts.

Therefore, if the weather is favourable, it is an absolute must to take a trip to the top of the mountain and look down at the Peninsula spread out below. As Cape Town locals, our personal best is to wait until the summer months, when the Cableway runs until around 9 at night. We then make a plan to take the ride up in the cablecar, so that we're at the top before sunset. (A picnic pack is a cheaper alternative to the mountain-top restaurants, but to be polite, don't try to eat and drink your own stuff on their \"turf\", or they have every right to get annoyed.). The views are fabulous and as the daylight fades away, the millions of lights of the Mother City twinkle. If you are able to time this trip at full moon, then that's extra special!"

We were told the wait would be approximately 30 minutes upon our arrival around 9 am. However, the line actually was at least one hour long. Since the \"line\" is a very wide set of stairs, it is very crowded, disorganized, and unenjoyable as you are constantly being pushed by people trying to cut in front of you. Very frustrating! There absolutely needs to be a more organized system to get travelers to the cable car. Of course, the car is the easiest and fastest (albeit most expensive) way to get to the top of Table Mountain. In our time crunch, it was the only option and still really worth it for the amazing views of the city. Also, since it is such a popular destination in Cape Town, there is no shortage of taxis to take you back home or to your next destination (without wait)."

We went soon after 8am and the wait was quite short. Take extra clothes. The temperature is 6deg C lower at the top of the mountain than at the bottom station and it's windy.

It's not just an incredible view from the top, it's a very zen experience to walk around in the unusual ecosystem of the area. We went first thing in the morning, which I highly recommend if you can do it since we avoided lines for the cable car and also it was not crowded on top. By the time we left, it was much busier and we were there off-season! I can only imagine what it's like there at the height of the tourist season in Cape Town. Although it was cloudy in town, we were way above the clouds once we went up the mountain and it was an incredible view although much of the city was blocked by the fog."

Cableway is wheelchair accesible and takes just a few minutes to bring you at the top where you can eat and walk... or to shop in the small souvenirs boutique. The prize is fair. The only thing it could be improved is about who to reach the base of the mountain. taxi seems the only way to go if you are not with a group. taxis do not wait for clients at the base of the mountain. They have to go down. So if you do not want to have a very bad surprise, this is preferable to ask your taxi driver to return at the base at a time you will decide together. Otherwise, you will have to call for a cab and wait a long to get it."

The wind can pick up quite quickly - check the daily forecast.2. It can be quite cold up there, so pack appropriately.3. Although it is Table Mountain, it's not 100% level, so for those who are not so nimble, or those travelling with prams / wheelchairs, you can still visit, but your ability to roam at the top will be curtailed."

The cold wind that day meant we didn't see a single dassie!We had quite a long wait in the queue to get into the cable car but you can buy tickets in advance. The downside of buying in advance is not knowing what the weather will be like - the cable cars do not run if it is too windy and if it is cloudy at the top you won't see much. You are a bit squashed into the cable cars if it is busy but it doesn't take very long to get to the top."

Having said that, we arrived without a ticket and the queue was about an hour, despite the heat there are covered walkways to wait under and later in the day when we came down they had misters over the people waiting. There is also a couple of places to buy soda, water and ice cream while you are waiting.The cable car ride is disappointingly short but with the 360 degree roatation it works really well as everyone gets to see the great views. The information on the history of the cars is also interesting.Obviously the biggest draw is the views from the top - and they are spectatcular! The sides facing the city are definately more crowded and the inevitable cafe/shop had a lot of people outside them. Allow enough time to really spend time walking the very well laid out paths and walkways at the top. We only spent an hour or so up there and we could have easily spent more.Can definately see why this is such a great draw for locals and visitors alike."

Be careful of the parking as we only found parking on the road side which meant a long walk could be had. I was lucky to find a spot just vacated aboutt 200m down from the entrance and was able to park and return just as the family had purchased tickets. We were pleasantly surprised with the wait as we only waited for one cable ride before it was our turn to spin up the hill and enjoy the fantastic views at the top. Waiting time I think can be the killer here as I spoke to some locals who said they have been able to walk up at times quicker than visiting friends who took the cable car.The visit to the top is well worth it with comfortable walks providing dramatic 360* views."

It's the most breathtaking 4 minute ride but I am not sure it was worth 3 and a half hours of my time and getting hot and bothered. Getting off the top was also an issue because we had to wait in line for another 20min odd to get back on the cable car. Then off course wait for the shuttle to take us back to the bottom.

We arrived on a cruise ship at the V & A Waterfront on a beautiful clear Monday morning and the first thing we did after leaving the ship was to take a taxi to the Lower Cable Station where we were lucky to only queue for about thirty minutes. It cost us 180 rand each for the return journey in the large, modern blue and yellow gondola. The slowly revolving floor meant we had 360 degree views and one window was open which made for better photos. The views from the gondola and also from the top of Table Mountain were awesome on such a clear day. We spent about an hour and a half at the top walking on the flat footpaths. Saw lots of wild flowers and birds and quite a few little rock hyrax. There were stunning views on all sides. After taking the cableway down we found lots of taxis and took one back to the Waterfront. The return taxi was a lot cheaper so it is worth trying to find out in advance how much the taxi fare should be."

Expensive captive photoshoot as you get to the gate layered onto Table Mtn backgrounds (but you don't have to buy on the way out if your mugshot is not so appealing). So after waiting nearly an hour we finally got on board despite some very pushy oriental tourists. Capacity on good days does come under pressure but unless you are fit enough or reckless enough, you don't want to climb the track.However, the ride was great .. the rotating shell of the gondola moved the open windows away from said pushy tourists to give a great photo opportunity.

Mother Nature is very particular, when it comes to the Mtn, so beware of bad weather. We were schedule to go up on Sat, but \"the table cloth was on the table\", meaning the top was covered in clouds, so are trip was cancelled. Our Driver, Graham, came back on Sunday and talked to the people at the lower station and we were allowed to use our ticket from Saturday on Sunday. Going up we were packed in like sardines, but the view made up for it and then some. the entire cablecar rotates very slowly, so there is no \"bad\" view. If you get in and stand on the middle, I don;t that section rotated, but you were standing on a little step, so you could lokk over people. Once on top, wander around and go crazy taking pictures, just like everyone else. It's like nothing else I've ever seen, simply awesome."

We took the gorge route to the left of the cable car which comprises of a 1.5-2 hour climb up what can be described as a very long staircase. I would recommend this to the fit as its quite a steep and physical climb, especially at 11am in 28 degree heat!!! Take plenty of water and glucose drinks or sweets as there is minimal shade on this hike.  We did however pick a perfect day to arrive at the top as the views were unbelievable especially after our well deserved beer!! We opted for the cable car down which was of great pleasure after our hike. If you plan on taking the cable care up I would advise pre booking your tickets and arriving early or in the afternoon as when we started our climb around 11 the queues were very long. All in all a must see if visiting Cape Town."

For those on a tighter budget, an option would be to hike up Platteklip gorge (starting behind the lower cable station) and then coming down using the cableway. The hike up (better done in a group with 3 or more people for safety) should take a person of average fitness around 2 hours to do. The cable car trip is amazing as the car rotates as it goes and you get to see the entire panorama. A trip down at around sunset (on a clear day) is truly an amazing experience with incredibly beautiful views."

Views are awesome across the bay, to Robben island and beyond. Couple of tips may help improve your enjoyment:- Its often cold and windy up there. Take a coat, even if it seems hot down below.- The top of the mountain has its own micro-climate, specifically cloud can form on the top which means you cannot see a thing. This can happen in a matter of minutes. So look up before you go and make sure you can see the top!- Buying tickets can take time. Better to do online ahead of time if you can (in our case, the hotel was happy to do this for us and saved a 30 minute queue)"

            "review": "MUST DO THIS TRIP IN CAPE TOWN. Definitely worth the trip and the panoramic views from this iconic mountain top. The cable cars rotate during the ascent/descent so all the passengers receive good views. There are several walks available along the mountain top which are easily managed by all ages. There is a restaurant and gift shop at the top with some really great ideas for momentos. Bookings for the Cableway are best made 'online' as the costs are discounted and there is no need to queue at the booking office. Be careful where you park your car however if you are self driving as the unofficial traffic wardens will allow you to park illegally and you will be ticketed by the vigilant traffic police - not a nice end to an unforgettable experience. The costs of the ride have escalated a lot and a return trip for a family of four is available as a discounted offer."

OK - everyone had warned us that it might be the case but it was day 4 of our trip before we were able to go up in the cable car to the top of Table Mountain. It is often windy &/or cloudy enough to prevent you from going up or from wanting to go up.Our kids (10&11 were very excited & LOVED the whole experience. I'm not great with heights but I still did it (& lived to tell the tale). Bubbly & a postcard at the top were my reward for being so brave (& not looking out on the way up).If you can do it, you really should. It doesn't cost a lot & the views of the city & harbour are stunning (even on the way up to the cable car)."

You also can squeeze a seat by the conductor where the floor doesn't rotate and you're in the center if you don't want to be close to the edge. Call ahead to be sure the cars are running because they can stop and start on a moment's notice depending on the weather."

The floor of the car rotates, but you can also stand in the center, which is slightly elevated and doesn't rotate. This allowed me to control the views I wanted to see and photograph. Because of winds, whether the cable runs changes from minute to minute. But it's an experience not to be missed. And the destination (Table Mountain) is awe-inspiring!"

Staff are professional and friendly. The floor rotates allowing you to get views of both the mountain and the city below. Walking on the top of the mountain, looking down on the city, is simply a must for anyone who visits or lives in the city.You wont regret your ride!I would take something warm to wear, the altitude does drop the temperature somewhat."

            "review": "Expensive but worth it if you're on limited time or lack the shape to climb. A 5-8 minute ride up the mountain for 95 Rand (Feb 2011) is a steep price to pay. However, the rotating floor allows all a very nice view of the mountain and city as you climb. Not much discount for the return trip either 190 Rand but then what choice have you got if your on a short trip in CPT and just trying to spend some quality time at the lovely Table Mountain while you've got chance. We recommend climbing the mountain as part of a half-day trip instead of the funicular if you've got the time, energy and shape. Its not that bad but your feel the ole tired legs on the walk back down to the city (recommend taking taxi back to your hotel). Also, check if the Cable Car is running, can be shut down on windy days, happens more than you'd like to beleive."

However, we were in Cape Town for six full days and only made the trip on the last day because it is closed a lot due to winds. If you are told it is open, change your plans and go so you don't miss this experience! The rotating cable car was amazing and the views at the top were fabulous. We walked a long way and didn't even take all of the walking tours. You could probably spend hours just doing that- A definite must-do in Cape Town."

The cable car line was long and the ride was crowded but it's definitely worth the hassle to go to the top. I think hiking it might be a more pleasant way but I'm not sure how long that takes!"

I happened to visit CapeTown in summers..2008!Taking a cable way up the table mountain was one experience where you feel like in an escalator taking you up to the heavens...AS the cable moves up...you can see the cloud cover approaching you and gradually coming beneath your feet...The hiking route has its own adventure but a cable way takes you up soo quickly as compared to the hike...and the view from above is soo majestic that hours and hours of walking wont fill your heart enough !"
