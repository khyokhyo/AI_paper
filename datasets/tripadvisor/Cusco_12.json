As a peruvian I have visited many markets in my city but going to this one in Cuzco was more than I ever expected. So many new products to see, herbs, cheese, traditional bread, flowers, meat, etc, I was also surprised by the big number of stands that serve traditional dishes and cheap prices, locals eating there and many nice people working at the market."

A little downside is that the tourist stalls with their completely indistinctive offerings are also present and taking more and more space.

I recommend grabbing a made-to-order fruit juice from one of the many stands as you enter & also visiting Mari\u2019s food stand (#837) at the back of the market for delicious cheap food. I wasn\u2019t sure how easy it would be to find a veggie-friendly lunch, but Mari was really welcoming & made me a plate of her \u2018Super Vegetariano\u2019 dish fresh to order - rice, salsa, fries, plantain, avocado, grilled cheese & banana chips, all for less than \u00a32! A great place to wander round, soak up the atmosphere & look at the impressive (& sometimes unusual) range of produce on offer. While you\u2019re here, make sure you get some Peruvian specialties \u2013 plenty of stalls sell corn, chocolate, chia seeds, maca, quinoa etc. & grab some fresh lucuma & cherimoya from one of the fruit stands."

The first thing you'll see when walking in are the rows and rows for fresh juice. Do yourself a favor - order a refreshing, fresh juice and sit down to relax. They have stools all over the place for you to take a load off, people watch and enjoy the best juice you'll ever drink.After you're refreshed, the rest of the market is filled with clothes and art, souvenirs and gifts. In the very back, you'll see plenty of places to have another seat with a very healthy serving of glorious soups and other beautiful dishes. Enjoy!"

The mercado is reasonably watertight. It is divided into a central area of 2 or 3 lengthy corridors that demarcate the \"food court,\" a periphery of stalls that offer soft goods, and additional rows of other assorted merchandise perpendicular to the \"food court.\" Remarkable was the fact that although there was an enormous volume of raw foods (butchered, but unwrapped, meats, poultry, fish), cheese, breads, cakes, there were no flies on the foodstuffs. Perhaps it is the altitude. If you are an adventurous gastronome, with access to cooking utensils, there were amny intriguing offerings. If you do not seek unnecessary labor, you could sit at any of many cafes, and dine with the locals. Prices, both for meals (mainly rotisserie chicken, sopas, and fish) and souvenirs are quite reasonable. Haggling is an expected behavior. The mercado is great fun for an hour or so."

Of course it's cheap if you're a westerner but compared to the rest of the markets in , say, Arequipa, Lima and other most other cities, you'll likely be paying more here than the others. Still not overly expensive and good as a one stop shop for all your souvenirs (and cheaper food) but if you're looking for the best deals the this is not the place."

Locals are doing there grocery shopping, eating the breakfast and are haggling for the best and lowest prices. This market is no exception and a must visit while visiting Cusco. It is situated in the centre of the city and can be seen in less than an hour. You'll be amazed by the things they are selling and how products including vegetables and meats of all kinds are presented. Personally I have seen quite some market but this market knew how to trigger my senses in different ways. They offer great fresh juices which I highly recommend. If you have a strong stomach and if you are adventurous enough you could join the locals for either breakfast, lunch or dinner! This market is also a great spot for photographers. A tip would be to either take pictures on longer range, or kindly ask to take pictures. They might ask for a contribution, 1 sol is the usual amount to pay."

Some reviewers are wary about the hot food stalls but I ate my way through the place without a problem...special shout out to the \"chicken soup lady\"...you can't miss her little stall due to the tightly packed locals squatting on plastic stools while other similar stalls are uncrowded. The soup was absolutely fabulous...loaded with tender chicken, veg and noodles with an optional spicy onion/pepper garnish...the flavor and quality are unmatched...and all for 6 soles!!!One of the very best lunches we had in the whole country.Overall, a fun, fascinating and filling afternoon!"

While there is a huge section of stands that serve food for very cheap prices, if you are a foreign traveler (especially from the US) I would not recommend eating there, simply because such places can make unaccustomed travelers quite sick. Regardless, it is a must visit for anyone passing through Cuzco!"

Meats, vegetables, fruits, flowers, section of food stalls, etc. Easy to walk to from Plaza de Armas. We took a taxi from Plaza San Blas only because they had all the roads closed and blocked on Friday the 24th because of the Inti Raymi festival and the cost one way was 6 Soles.I would recommend trying some fresh juices from one of the vendors, they are refreshing and so tasty and at 5-6 Soles, you cannot go wrong. We are pretty adventurous eaters and would have tried a bowl of the \"Caldo de Pollo\", which seemed the common food offered everywhere, but we were still pretty full from breakfast and skipped it. Just an FYI, especially for the ladies, bathroom situation is pretty nasty, they have a huge bathroom building outside, but they are those squatters holes. We walked quite a ways away from the mercado in search of a restaurant and I was lucky to find one that let me use their bathroom it wasn't that much better, but definitely an upgrade from the squatters."

Cooked food stall is crowed with locals. The food looks interesting, but I haven't dared to try one. The cloth and souvenir stalls are worth a visit. The first offered price is already at least 30% cheaper than the final offer I got from the shops in Sacred valley. Of course, the negotiation can reduce further the price. But generally speaking, I guess that it is hard to find any authentic local hand made souvenir without a very decent budget. The original packages of scarf, bags in the market show that they are made in China."

This local market has 4 sections - the fruits/vegetable section, the fresh meat section, the food section and surrounding it the knick-knacks sections. The fruits/vegetables sections has a huge variety of goods - there are 3500 varieties of potatoes to start with! There are fruits from the jungle that I have not seen before, along with many recognizable tropical fruits. Roots, vegetables, tubers of all kinds - it is a riot of colors and smells for the senses.The fresh meat section is not for the squeamish - much like what one finds in Asia, freshly slaughtered meat is hung in open air, alongside innards, and heads of various animals. Can't have it any fresher?The cooked food section is apparently very popular for lunch with the locals - we did not try eating here. One popular dish is a stew cooked with the sheep's head - has a strong aroma to it, which is likely what one smells as one gets closer to the stalls. On the other side of the market though, are the fruit juice stalls where fresh fruit juices are extracted - delicious. One special drink consisting of a mix of \"stuff\", mainly fruits and root extracts and dark Malt Beer, called \"especial con malta\", is a popular drink for energy and health benefits. It may seem strange to mix malt beer (stout), with fruit juices, but it actually tastes pretty good - try it! But be forewarned that it is pretty filling and you are drinking beer even though diluted, so there is alcohol in the drink! But definitely worth trying and yumm!The last section is the section where they sell all sorts of knick knacks - good deals to be had if you are willing to bargain, and shop around. An interesting insight into what the local Cusco-ans eat, drink, buy especially if you can snag a local who will explain some of the \"so called strange\" (unknown) stuff to you."

Even though I was careful about eating raw produce in Peru, the juices are made fresh without water from peeled produce and we were fine drinking it two days in a row. Come hungry!"

Markets tend to be very vibrant and exciting places for certain \"2nd world\" countries and this is definitely a gem of a market place!I recommend u visit the market early on in your visit to Cusco for many reasons.As the start of this review mentioned...its exciting! This place is filled with food stands that serves local dishes for cheap, and stores that sells local produce. Very colorful and full of aroma! You get to sit down with locals and tourists alike and order a dish from visual displays from one of the many food vendors. Try a cerviche stand and watch how they put together this \"fish salad\" dish! Ingredients are all put out in the open in plastic containers and the market place isn't the cleanest place in the world...dont come here if u only tolerate restaruantsAfter a meal and u explore the rest of the market and check out some fresh produce u can try. I recommend everything from the fresh fruits, nuts, bread, and even quinoa if u got cooking ultilies in ur accomodation. Eating and buying from the market is definitely your thing if ur on a budgetYou can also wander the streets surrounding the market building itself as the area is one big market area. There is some desert/sweets vendors on one of the streets that u can find easily. Some of the cakes looked REALLY good and dirt cheap tooone big WARNINGDont go to the toilet there. I'm an asian and dirty toilets aren't new to meBut that public toilet is horrendous. U pay 1-2pesos to use it and the place is probably the dirtiest place u can imagine. They even got a big plastic barrel filled with water that people wash from.TIP: go to the toilets before u make ur way to the market. Bring some hand sanitizerOtherwise the market was awesome!"

It was also open on a Sunday, when most other things are closed in Peru. (Though not all of the stalls were open)However, because the vendors know that their clientele is mostly tourists, many will quote you some pretty high prices. For example, I wanted one of those tiny alpaca magnets (that are probably made out of synthetic instead of actual alpaca). Everyone was quoting 2 soles, when I know for a fact that my friend bought them for one. It\u2019s kind of exhausting, but I hate getting ripped off. Alternatively, you don\u2019t need to go to San Pedro to get souvenirs. I found that poking my head through some courtyards near the Plaza del Armas was also good, and sometimes even cheaper. Everyone pretty much sells the same stuff, so just start searching early!"

Here you will find the freshest produce and raw ingredients used to cook all the amazing Peruvian food. You can pick up souvenirs at really great prices and if you're feeling hungry (and your stomach is ready) try some of the dishes that are freshly prepared everyday. A wonderful place to come see and taste the delights that Cusco has to offer."

The market covers a very large area, under roof but still in open air. The market is divided into a number of well marked areas including Fruits, Vegetables, Juices, Textiles, Spices, etc. The juices area was unique as those vendors were very vocally active in getting our attention. There are also plenty of souvenirs available in the market as well as a \"restaurant\" where you can sit down and enjoy lunch in the market. The meat department was amazing not only for the quantity and variety of meats but also because there was large quantities of meat on display without the aid of refrigeration. Although not the exclusive means of transport, many of the vendors use wheelbarrows to supply the market. Quite a colorful sight! We had previously noticed that there were a disproportionate number of wheelbarrows for sale in local storefronts. We had found one of the answers!"

One of my favorite places to go during my travels is the local market \u2013 it\u2019s really the only way to see the real culture, food, traditions and every day local life. I could have spent hours and hours walking around here. For some, it may be too much \u2013 for me - it\u2019s why I travel, as I enjoy getting out of my comfort zone, and learning about other cultures. We went on Saturday, and then again on a weekday - both days were busy. There is an array of colors, foods, grains, clothes, fruit juices, prepared foods, bread \u2013 anything needed for daily life. Make sure you walk inside the building where you will find food stalls, fish, meat, fresh juices, etc. The \u201canimal parts\u201d section was quite the experience. Some areas are difficult to swallow (or smell), but who are we to judge? Make sure to respect the locals, and be aware when taking pictures - most locals don\u2019t want their pictures taken, so try to be discreet. Also, as in any area with crowds, watch you pockets and bags, as this would be an easy place for pickpockets, although we had no issues. Outside the \u201cmarket\u201d area you can walk for blocks & blocks and discover more local shopping areas. We enjoyed this area, but again be safe \u2013 we had a police officer stop us, reminding us to be aware of pickpockets. Although I would have loved to tried the food, we didn\u2019t, as I didn\u2019t want to take the chance of getting my pristine Western stomach sick. Per Western standards, the market food is unsanitary and is obviously not regulated as you see dirty hands touching food everywhere, not to mention the flies landing on the food. We had a friend who ate at this market and had no problems \u2013 just eat at your own risk"

Prices here are half of what they were in the \"artisanal\" market, and we didn't bother to do any negotiations as the prices were already pretty low and certainly reasonable. Lots of stalls at the back to sit and eat, either chicken soup or rice dishes, average cost was 5 soles, pretty cheap eats! There are lots of stalls outside the market too, we spent about an hour wandering the streets there, streets are none too clean, but the market was."

San Pedro is the main local market of the locals, the descendants of the Incas, and here you can see fabulous displays of the source of the wealth of their imperial ancestors. No, not rooms full of gold; that gold was the result of their wealth, nor the source. The source was agriculture. It's been estimated that the farmers of the Inca's empire most of the foods that are eaten in the world today: no mean feat given that most of the empire was either frigid mountain or scorching desert. But the Andeans gave the Irish their potatoes, the Italians their tomatoes, the Central Europeans their Hungarian paprika and the Southeast Asians their Thai peppers as well as the quinine in the gin and tonics that were indispensable in malarial lands. Not to mention peanuts and cashews, squash and sweet potatoes, papayas and strawberries. Where would the Hawaiians be without pineapples? Where would the Belgians be without chocolate? Or Bugs Bunny without carrots? Luckily for world cuisine, much of this cornucopia has spread to the ends of the earth. But not all of it. Some of the best stuff is still largely unknown. But it's known in the San Pedro Market, and bought and sold every day. Here you can see 20 different varieties of corn in every color in the rainbow (as well as white, black, and grey, which were inadvertently left out of the rainbow), arranged as artistically as the goods at a Hanoi flower mart (see picture). There you can find long, long rows of potatoes, forty different varieties, purple, green, lemon with red spots, others long and thin like delicate fingers, with tiger stripes of black on orange (see photo). Back toward the east side of the market, one section is devoted entirely to hierbes medicinales: what ails you, neighbor? Gastritis, ulcers, prostate, diabetes? We've got you covered, whatever it is, and no, you don't need a prescription! (See photo) Recalling that these were the folks who'd given the medical world quinine, ipecac and the coca leaf, I wanted to ask what they had for altitude sickness, but my Spanish failed me. There are of course lots of other things at San Pedro, and other reviewers have discussed the fruit juice stands, the innards row, the poultry, the sausage vendors. But markets on other continents have such things. I was drawn to the items unique to the Andes. Extending that to coastal Peru, San Pedro has a good, cheap and popular cevicheria as well, in the northeast part of the market, which is well worth a stop (see photo)."

Don't miss this, unless your stomach's playing up :SOn the other hand the fresh food and definitely the textiles markets are very set up for tourists. There's a good range and you can negotiate, but you might need a few tricks to get a bargain.Whatever price you go for, the stall owners generally act offended! So persevere. The best tactic we found was to wait for a local to shop in the stall you wanted, so you could hear the 'real' price of things and refer to that in your bartering.Overall, a great fun place to be - don't miss it.For more Cuzco travel tips, check out our blog!https://ednaventures.wordpress.com/2014/12/09/cuzco-a-beautiful-countdown/"

Despite the chaos that first presents itself, this market is actually very organized. It is roughly divided into local crafts, food supplies for sale (an aisle each for cheese, bread, various meats, etc.) and fresh food for purchase. Once we got the hang of it it became very useful for supplies.Having now traveled a bit around Cusco, the prices are not heavily marked up here; in fact, they were often lower (and more up for negotiation) than in several other places. We bought, in no particular order, sweaters, hats, socks, bananas, a bucket of fresh local fruit, a ham sandwich, tamales, and a miniature alpaca. They even have supplies like batteries, tea, etc.This is like having a giant grocery store where everything is fresh and local and you have lots of variety.

Perhaps the most interesting is what our tour guide coined the \"ritual and 'witchcraft' section\". These stalls are filled with goods and products that are used by locals for all of their history. There are things used for rituals and praying, artifacts and charms for luck and blessings, herbal remedies for sickness, and so on.

While this certainly helped to section things off - they even had overhead signs like I'm a grocery store - I felt like it took away from the creativity and surprise, and led to this strange situation where if you're looking down an aisle, all the vendors would waive to you to tell you to come to theirs even though each stall was basically identical."

Not just meat - we bought nuts, dried fruit, bread, fruit \u2013 and ate it most of it immediately. We also went back to the cooked food [lunch] area and had a pecado frito placa. A piece of fried fish [bone in], lentils, rice and beans to cover the plate [placa] for 3.50 soles \u2013 about a buck and a quarter!"

Here you\u2019ll find fresh produce, meats of numerous varieties, homemade cheeses, grains and even kitchenware, clothes and home decorations. The market is divided up much like a grocery or department store, with booths selling similar items on the same aisle (or multiple aisles).Definitely check out some for the items available. Need a whole hog or a side of beef, just a few llama steaks or even a guinea pig for dinner? It is all available. There is also a food court serving local dishes prepared on site, complete with roving musicians. Of course there is a tourist section selling souvenirs. In this section, beware of the \u2018alpaca\u2019 scarves and other items sold here. The prices reflect authenticity.If you have a little free time while in Cusco, you should visit San Pedro Market. If you only walk through or spend a greater amount of time exploring each aisle, visit the market and absorb the local culture and a part of the daily way of life in the Andes. It is east of the train station and just a few blocks west of the historic district."

A 50 gram chia seed cost 2 soles.- Don't be afraid to join in the locals and have a bowl of famous chicken noodle soup for 5 soles (see picture). It is so flavoursome!- Along the way to the San Perdo market, you will see tons of cerviche stall. They are only 2 soles for a small tiny plate sold at the street stall. I strongly encourage and recommend you to try it. I had 3 plates in a row, guarantee no food poisoning. It is truly a brand new culinary experience for the most famous dish in Peru.- Didn't really see a lot of gringos hanging out in the food markets here. Maybe they were worried of being mugged or having food poisoning. - The market also sells touristy souvenirs but super overpriced.- Wear a good pair of covered shoes because you do not want to wet your feet with dirty water.- Lots of quail eggs sellers, steamed boiled potato sellers and fruit/vege sellers.- Very difficult to find a toilet around here.If you think my reviews have been helpful to you, please click 'Yes' for 'Was this review helpful?'"

It was actually one that was in the main market area rather than the main eating area but that wasn't really a conscious choice (the one with lime green cushions on the benches).

At the early hour, locals were drinking fresh fruit juices and eating steaming bowls of chicken soup. Each isle is filled with the most delicious breads, cheeses, fruits - everything you need! The meat isle was not for the faint of heart - I was so sad that I had no where to cook! We came back for lunch - we each had a two course meal of delicious soup and the plate of the day - rice and lentils with salad. I only ate the tomatoes and they were DELICIOUS! DO NOT miss this market!"

We stayed in Cusco for a few days only, but the San Pedro markets was our favourite spot in the city, and a great escape from the other tourist traps in the town. You can choose to just wander around, taking in the sights and sounds. The market sells fresh food, groceries, souvenirs, meat, cheese - and it makes for a nice experience just checking things out. It also has (and this is our fav bit) a big section dedicated to food - rows and rows of juice stalls, breakfast stalls, and lunch stalls. We ate there a number of times - breakfast and lunch - and will highly recommend it. We tried the cafe con leche and the torta for brekkie; and the arroz con huevos y plata (rice with fried egg and avocado), heaped with the special chilli salsa. Delicious!!"

Row after row of textiles, followed by rows of butchers (Americans are certainly not used to seeing pigs heads, entrails, and organ meats prominently displayed!), then fruits & vegetables, cheeses, chocolates, and in the back were dozens of restaurants. I knew once my husband saw them I would never eat at a sit down \"touristy\" restaurant again while in Cusco. I opted for soup, figuring that the hot temperature would keep the bacteria down. It was absolutely the best meal I had in Peru, and we went back several times with no problems. They greeted us like we were long lost friends, sitting elbow to elbow with locals on long benches. What a wonderful experience. I'm convinced that you are more likely to get \"traveler's diarrhea\" or other creepy-crud from a touristy place in which you'll pay 10 times what you pay at these little places!"

But the sweaters and scarves at still very beautiful and inexpensive. Bought a colorful soft scarf for $5. Great bargain. Another great thing about the market was the fruit juices and vegetable soup. Although its true that the cleanliness of the place is in question, the soup was really delicious. I didnt get sick at all. I ate at the market twice and they gav me seconds. Imagine a large bowl of soup plus seconds for only $1.20. Cant beat it. If you want to know about medicinal plants in the market, please ask for Doris. She is the best thing in the market.

The sheer variety of trinkets and Peruvian wares is staggering, running the gamut from tacky to outrageous. But the real draw is the food. Rows of vendors serve a vast array of cheap and hearty dishes, including potatoes, corn, fresh breads, delicious soups, rice dishes, and every cut of meat imaginable. I ate lomo saltado all over Peru, but it was never as tasty as it was here. What\u2019s more, the portions are huge, and the prices (a BIG lunch runs less than 5 soles) are awesome. Eat the hot sauces! They're good on everything.Ordering can be daunting at first. The overwhelming number of variations on a single theme can be hard to decipher. For instance, one could order lomo saltado with avocado (palta), eggs (huevos), and countless other addendums. If you aren\u2019t sure what/how to order, just hang around and watch what the locals do. Knowing even a little Spanish or Quechua will serve you well here, but people are friendly even if you struggle. The fresh fruit/juice stands (there are literally dozens in a row) are also wonderful. Choosing one seems rather arbitrary, since they all seem to be peddling the same stuff. A warning: drinks are often mixed with ice (i.e. the local water), but it never affected us. It\u2019s mostly locals in here, so you\u2019ll stand out a little bit \u2013 but that\u2019s part of the fun. I\u2019ve heard others mumble about safety and/or the relative cleanliness of \u201cstreet food,\u201d but you\u2019re missing an essential Cusco experience if you don\u2019t eat here at least once."

If you go, and want to shop, take Soles as they will not take American dollars. The market was a busy place packed with people buying and selling, some with booths and some simply sitting in an aisle with their products in front of them. One area had what we would refer to as a food court where the locals were all enjoying hot steaming soup. There were cooked chickens stacked on the counter and when someone would order soup, a chunk of chicken was chopped off and dropped into a bowl of steaming broth, vegetables and noodles. In one area women were busy chopping up meat, and from the looks of it, nothing goes to waste - including bull\u2019s noses. There were aisles packed with beautiful fragrant flowers, stacks of herbs, vegetables we could not begin to identify and an interesting array of people of all ages.For us this was a must see stop where we could see how the area people trade and the types of products that are produced in the area."
