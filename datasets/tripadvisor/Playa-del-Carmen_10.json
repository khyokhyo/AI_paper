            "review": "Hidden family adventure gem!. Our family is very active and loves adventure. We were driving down the road to Tulum and saw this place. We decided to visit. For $35 a person we got the all inclusive treatment. A tour guide that took us on a bike ride to visit a Cenote cave. Zip lining, snorkeling in some pretty awesome Cenotes and then we got to enjoy the park on our own. Soooo much better then those hyped up Xelxa parks, xcaret parks. We have done it all. Don't get me wrong those places are fun. But, this place for the $ offers so much more! We actually got to relax and enjoy our time together as a family... no running around the park, no pushing and shoving with other guests. We got top notch service, individual attention and once we were hungry they have a kitchen that serves delicious empenadas (for a little extra cash). So, if you are looking for a unique experience this is it! It's been about a week since we visited and not a day goes by that my kids don't talk about Chikin-Ha. Thank you David for being an awesome tour guide."

This was preceded in the tour by a snorkel with turtles in Akumel. We did a Viator tour. Nickolas was our guide and was excellent. The cenotes are intrguing and beautiful with extraordinarily clear water. A tad chilly but not too bad. This was a geographical learning experienced, full of beauty and just a great tour. Lunch is a little skimpy. Photos were $30 for the entire tour which compared to other tours is a great buy and you can bring your own waterproof camera. We enjoyed this and Nickolas was a great guide. I wish they would take the large orange hose out of the cenote and remove the wire cable above it. They detract from the photos and views."

Their literature described it as a visit to a cenote after lunch. The photos looked nice. What actually happened is that you arrive, get to do 3 zip lines, 2 over open cenotes, and one high and fast one. Then you have lunch, we had fresh cooked empanadas and pico de galo. Food was amazing. Then a Mayan cleansing ritual. Then you get to swim through a cave seeing the rock formations and cave paintings. Then FINALLY a swim in the beautiful cenote. It was an incredible day out and value as part of this trip, and I would recommend it to anyone staying nearby."

If you're a certified diver, with great buoyancy and comfort in tight places, then a guided cenote dive is a good thing to do.We have gone with several groups, and went with a guide from German Yanez, a world-recognized cave instructor in Cozumel. They handled all of the arrangements.The cenote starts in a pool. After donning your gear, going over safety procedures and gas management, we were off. The cenotes in this area are fairly cold (need a 5mm wetsuit, and a hood, to stay warm). You will need a light and a back-up. The guided tour is very relaxed. You get to see a lot of the cave, the halcyon line (fresh/salt-water demarcation layer), and lots of channels and small rooms.It takes a whole day to do this dive (you will probably move to another site), but is well worth the effort and planning that it takes to do it safely."

            "review": "Incredible experience. My husband and I were staying near Akumal for our honeymoon and we booked an excursion through Ocean Tours Akumal turtles and cenotes. It was the best day we had on our trip! Our tour guide, Macarena, was so knowledgeable and incredibly sweet. Our group was able to visit 3 cenotes at Chikin Ha, where we swam in 2 and observed the other. I had never experienced anything like this! It was amazing! The cave cenote was breathtaking. We snorkeled in the crystal clear, very cold water and we couldn't even see the bottom. I thought I would be scared since it was kind of dark in that one and we were in a cave, but the group was great and there was a line to hold on to when we went from one part of the cenote to another. I had never seen such clear water in my life!The open cenote was also amazing. It was in the middle of the jungle and had beautiful plants under the water and so many colorful fish. My husband used to have a fish tank full of guppies and we saw them there in their natural habitat! That was cool. The water felt so amazing since it's so hot and humid in August, and we didn't want to leave! If you couldn't tell, we LOVED LOVED LOVED this excursion and I definitely recommend booking with a group and a knowledgeable travel guide. She told us stories about the wildlife and the cenotes and the history there. Everyone always felt safe and comfortable too. We booked Ocean Tours through Lomas Travel at our hotel for $79USD per person for the sea turtle snorkeling in Akumal plus these cenotes and it was worth every single penny!"

            "review": "Chickin-Ha cenote. We heard about cenotes many times from our friends, but experienced this miracle for the first time in the summer of last year (2015). We were vacationing in Mexico, in Playa del Carmen, that day we vent to Tulum, to see Mayas ruins and pyramids, than we vent to the beach, not far away to swim with turtles. The day was really, really hot (nothing unusual for the summer), we were tired, beat up, and heat existed. The only thing we could of dream was a cool shower, and cold beer. Our friends told us that they have a surprise for us; I told them that the only surprise I will accept is a cold 6-pack. But they took as (me, my wife and my daughter) to a place like I have never seen before ( and only 300 pesos per person , $ 15 dollars) I could not understand what it was, but the water looked so fresh and inviting, so we just went right in. Oh, my Lord, it is absolute impossible to describe the feeling that we experienced at that moment. After 98 degree heat, submerging your body in the cool (70 degree) water was heavenly. We spent about 1-1.5 hours swimming, relaxing, and enjoying the water and the beautiful view. When we came out of the cenote (that how my friend told me that little lake was called), I understood meaning of the word- rejuvenation. It felt like there was no long day of extreme heat and long walking behind as, It really felt \u2026\u2026Well, I don\u2019t know how to describe the feeling. Skin, burned by mad Mexican sun felt so soft and smooth. Undesirable.This year we went there again. Highly recommending. The cenote called Chickin-Ha located on Mexican freeway # 307 ."

Both of them are partially in a cave, and partially out in the open. The water is crystal clear and cool enough to feel crisp and refreshing, but not cool enough to seem cold. There is nothing in the water that is going to bite you. Swimming here makes you feel like you are truly lost in the jungle, stumbling across your own oasis. There are few crowds, so when I was there (around 2pm), my party had the whole place to ourselves. I will go back again.You can get a taxi from your hotel, all the way back into the jungle and not walk the 1.5 miles from the main road yourself. BUT negotiate a price first, before you leave your hotel and for ROUND TRIP. Otherwise, if you wait to call a taxi when ready to leave the cenote, the price quadrupled on us to get back to the hotel."

The Cenote Chakin Ha is not too far from Playa del Carmen, around 30 Minutes by Collettivo ( cheap Van Taxi Service ) it's composed from more than a Cenote and just in one is possible to swim . The Daily Pass of 300 Pesos per person include the possibility to swim in the Cenote and to visit the area around it where you can discover another 1 or 2 Cenotes and 2 Caves . With a guide is possible to visit one of these Caves where is possible to swim, otherwise you can look at it from a kind of terrace built next to it . The area it's plenty of mosquitos ! ! !

We booked the Turtles and Cenotes tour with Oceantour through our resort and had a wonderful time. My family of four (kids 12 and 15) was picked up on time by the tour bus and our guide for the day was Francesca, who was simply marvellous the entire time. We were driven to Akumel Beach where everyone was provided with life jackets and snorkel gear. Francesca was great at giving her instructions and Gonzales was our photographer for the tour. We spent about 50 minutes snorkelling and were able to see about six different sea turtles eating and two sting rays. After our swim with the turtles we were driven to the Cenote Chikin Ha.Again, Francesca was great at giving us the history of the cenotes and we were able to swim in a large open one and then got to go in a partial underground one. It was such an amazing experience. After swimming, a buffet meal was included, which was only fruit and meat on a bun. We were not impressed at all with the meal, but it was the turtles and the cenotes that we came for and we were not disappointed in either area. After lunch Gonzales showed the groups pictures and the price for a CD or a USB was $30.00 U.S.D., which I felt was quite reasonable (Actually at the time of writing this review, I had just finished another similar tour and the tour offered their pictures for $65.00, so $30.00 was a definite deal).Overall it was a great tour. Remember to bring swim wear and a wet shirt (long sleeved is better) as they do not allow sunscreen with the turtles or the cenotes. If you forget the wet shirt or t-shirt, OceanTour does offer to sell their long sleeve shirts for $20.00 U.S."

I highly recommend a full body wetsuit. I went with a shortie and was fine for the first dive, then cold on the second. Water is super clear and there are only rock formations to look at.

Fun experience seeing several different areas starting with 8 am pickup in Playa and returning around 2:30.Started at Akumai Bay with turtles and coral reef. Probably saw between 15-20 turtles. Ricardo and his photographer did a great job. I can't remembe the photographers name, but he did an awesome job. He took over 200 pictures in which you could purchase on a flash drive for $30. Great pictures of many animals, group and couple shots as well as the scenery.---well worth the money. Other highlights included several stingrays, puffer fish, and endless reef shots. After snorkeling with turtles, took a short trip to Cenotes. We were able to swim in two Cenotes, plus visit another one with a religious ceremony taking place. Water was so refreshing. Ricardo did a great job explaining traditions as well as identifying various plant life--root systems are amazing. Small snack before return to resort.They don't allow sunscreen at the the bay, so recommend wearing a shirt if sunburn is a concern. Highly recommend this experience as the Cenotes was something I hadn't experienced. It wasn't a strenuous activity. Equipment of snorkel, mask, and life jacket were of decent quality."

We had never heard of this one, but we drove by and saw it on the side of Federal Highway 307, about 20 KM south of Playa Del Carmen. This cenote is not listed or advertised in any of the brochures or pamphlets. It is next to Cenote Cristalinos and Cenote Katchen-Ha park. It is a mile west of the highway and a info booth is located at the front gate. The man at the booth provides you with a ticket and you pay at the reception desk inside the park. There were showers, changing rooms, and running water and toilets. There were two types of ticket prices: one for the zip line and all cenotes they had to offcer for $45 or the $20 for the three cenotes. We chose the $20 option, and it was well worth it. Water was cool, clean, and actually drinkable (although i did taste it and it was cold and clean). We spent about 3 hours there. Bring water shoes, towels, and some food or snacks. They do have a small kitchen and souvenir stands. Life jackets and snorkel equipment is available at no extra charge."

Maybe 20ppl in the entire park.My wife and I, both in our mid 40s, and were staying at the Hard Rock Riviera Maya on a vaca in late May 2016. We wanted to see some of the local cenotes but thought the $240 USD for the tour the hotel offered was an unreasonable amount. I was right ;^)This is park is only 5 miles south of the resort. We took a taxi from the resort and it took less than 10 minutes to get there and cost $200 pesos ($11USD). We gave ourselves about 3 hours to visit the park and asked the taxi to pick us up afterwards and they did.We paid $600 pesos ($33USD) for the two us for the entrance fee. PROBABLY..a bit more than we should have, but we came outside a tour group and we didn't call before coming.The park is very rustic, Xcaret...it is not, but that is what we wanted. Everyone speaks english and are very cool. There are not lockers, so bring the minimum. If you have a snorkeling set, bring it or they will rent a set for $50 pesos.A guide will walk you around the park from about 20 minutes. Don't worry...they are not there to follow you around all day. Let them show you everything. I am a generous tipper and I gave my guide $200 pesos, probably $100 is fine.There are 3 cenotes, although you swim in just 2 of them. The 1st cenote in the back is the best. Your half in a cavern and the water is crystal clear. The 2nd cenote is more like swimming in a creek with clear water. There is a lot of vegetation, so there is a lot decay that can get stirred up if you are not careful. The fish viewing is fantastic, all fresh water. Three-3 1/2 hours is really all you need, then move on down to the other Cenotes in the area or Akumal Beach.Bring: a backpack or bag, a few bottles of water, snorkeling set, a few towels, an UNDERWATER CAMERA!!, and maybe a small snack."

The other cenotes are nice for swimming (I believe there are 4 cenotes in the park), but the absolutely amazing place is the underground river. It is a little expensive (somewhere around the $50 mark per person, but that includes the guide). I took my parents with me) (my father is 70 and my mother 60), and we had no issue. Along with us there was another couple with a girl (around 8 or 9), who also had no issue (other than the cold water of the cenote. We all loved it.

This cenote has a very beautiful nature setting around the water, but the water was murky and small. We enjoyed seeing a lot of fishes, though. The 3 attractions (Xtabay, Chikin-Ha and Taakbil-Ha) were worth for the price of $20 per person. If you have your own snorkel equipment, bring them with you! If you don't have them, they cost $6.25 each per person. The mask and the snorkel come together, but the fin cost separately. The Xtabay and Chikin-Ha-- you may swim there. It's not big, though. It felt like a pool-sized cenote and you may not swim at the Taakbil-Ha. Beautiful nature to look and there's a path to walk through. We came here at 2:15pm and it was very quiet. With us- there were only like 9 people. I'm not sure if earlier in the day, it's packed, but if there were just 11 of us, it kind of says a lot. If you have a time to spare, visit this cenote, but if you don't... find a better cenote to visit."

Our guide Marco picked us up in front of our lobby about 25 minutes late due to having to wait for other guests at a different hotel. We drove to one more hotel and then drove to Akumal beach. At the van we stripped down to our bathing suits and were fitted with the appropriate sized life jackets, fins, mask and snorkel. All our belongings were safely left behind in the van. Once at the beach, we showered and had some photos taken by a photographer and then went into the water to get our gear on. Marco was super helpful and patient with everyone while our group of 12 figured out how to put on all our equipment. Once we were ready we all walked backwards into the water and then started swimming out as a group. Within a few minutes we spotted a green turtle. Minutes later we saw a white stingray and then a grey stingray. Eventually we swam out of the zoned off beach area and over to the reef. There we managed to see lots of colourful fish and amazing huge black and white spotted ray. On our way back to the beach we saw two more turtles and another ray. All in the span of about 45 minutes.After we showered off, we headed back to our van and drove to the cenotes (which happen to be across the road from the Barcelo resort). We exited the van and walked over to the Emerald cenote - half open, half cave. I have to say this is one of the most amazing creations of nature I've ever seen. The water was clearer than anything I'd ever seen before. It had crystal clear blue water with beautiful green plants growing. Looking the other direction you saw turquoise water that led to amazing underwater caverns that turned into pitch black nothingness. The next cenote was the Turquoise cenote and this one was most under limestone cave roof. The water here was a dark turquoise and there were underwater caves and crevices in all directions. There were a few divers here checking out the caves. These underwater caves go for miles and miles. The final cave was a dry cave, meaning that we didn't snorkel in it because there was only a little bit of water. There were amazing vines that came down from the top of the cenote ceiling and plunged into the water. These are the roots of the ficus trees, known to grow many hundreds of meters to seek water. There was also a sacred Mayan ritual going on in the cave with a beautiful procession of candles lighting the pathway. This traditional Mayan cleansing ceremony wasn't accessible to the public. But we were able to smell the beautiful aromatic traditional Mayan incense that was filling up the cenote. After the last cenote we had a light snack of simple Mayan fair.We had an amazing time and would do the tour again in a heartbeat."

My son and I booked a tour from Cancun to four cenote visits that included ziplining, kayaking, and snorkeling, and it was truly an epic father/son adventure. The tour guide ride to the four separate cenote parks took approximately an hour an a half from Cancun's hotel zone and occasionally down some rough and pot-holed roads (Mayan massage).into the cenote areas.  At the sites yoiu'll toss on life vests, harnesses, and helmets to be lowered down into one crystal clear cenote for an amazing view and experience. At another you'll zipline into an open cenote and splashdown in fresh water and laugh when you do. At another you'll jump off a small cliff into the jungle river and swim your way up to another zipline adventure. The final one also included a short kayak trip down another jungle setting.  If you're fortunate to have a good tour guide you'll get a look at the local flora and fauna, maybe try out some ancient Mayan gum (not bad, actually, and learn which trees to stay away from like the black sap variety that will blister your skin should you cut into it (eh, don't. It's a park and the tree will take its revenge. Saw some colorful birds and enjoyed the jungle setting. The Xenote tour group also includes lunch for the day outing. There are rest rooms into the park and plenty opportunity for waterproof cameras or cell phones to get some one-in-a-lifetime photos. Finally this, don't be afraid to try the ziplines into the cenotes. They have two offerings; the first is the slide for life bar where you hold on and release at your time while the second provides a sling to sit in until you hit the water. Exits from the cenotes require some stair climbs and smiles. Enjoy!"

At the time we went it still smelled of incense and there was a shaman at the far end of the cave setting up for a ceremony, it was very beautiful and interesting. The other two you can snorkel or dive in (we were part of a snorkel tour). The water was crystal clear, and one was 15m deep. It was one of the most surreal experiences I've ever had, it was just lovely. People who have trouble with stairs may struggle with accessing the cenotes, as the stairs are carved into the rock and are not level at all points. However, most people should have no trouble with the snorkeling- you don't have to be particularly fit to enjoy. I do recommend wearing a wet suit and a life jacket- it was cool in the shaded cenote, and most tours require you to wear a life jacket."

They contain mineral water that is great for the skin and are a nice change from the salt water of the ocean. A short hike in leads you to the first cenote where you are able to swim with wild freshwater fish. The local flora and fauna is unscathed and can be observed in its natural beauty. Further up the trail there are even more cenotes with interesting stories behind each one. There are old religious relics that can be observed and the history is very interested to learn about. If you're lucky, you may catch a glimpse of the rare mot-mot birds that are native to the area. Overall a great experience and this one goes highly recommended."

Buried in the jungle, the crystal clear waters of these underground rivers, caves & caverns offer interesting scuba dives & snorkeling. The cenotes were part of the survival of the Mayan culture.You won't see as many fish as in the sea itself, but the system of caves & caverns offers a unique, refreshing water experience. A Mayan ceremony is also part of the experience."

The Chikin Ha Eco Park and cenotes was located almost directly across the road. Speaking to the man tending the gate entrance was a pleasant experience and we were told it was $300 MEX per person to go swimming in the cenotes. It was a 1.5 kilometer walk up a dirt road until we arrived at the reception to the cenotes and park (this is where you pay your admission). I'm a birder and had some good quality birds along the entrance road and hoped to walk it again the following morning. I spoke to the man at the entrance to the park and he told me that just walking up the road was no problem and that I would not need to pay the entrance fee as I was not entering the areas where the cenotes are located. I returned the next morning and set off down the road excited to have found somewhere with suitable habitat and a reasonably large forest. Not 15 minutes into my walk I was stopped by one of the Chikin Ha staff members who informed me that I could not enter the area without first paying the admission price. I explained that I had spoken to the gate keeper a day earlier and he had no problem with me walking the road, I was essentially told to shove it and that by walking past the gate I needed to walk the remaining kilometer and pay the price of admission. Although we enjoyed the cenotes and subsequent birding, this experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth and I did not return to the park. I am more than happy to support local parks and wildlife areas, however $300 MEX (approximately $20 - 25 usd) is a ridiculous price to pay daily for the experience of walking up a dirt road. If you are visiting the area I would recommend checking out some of the many other cenotes located in the immediate area instead."

It had a cave setting but the light hitting the water was just right. It was great to say the least. The last cenote was \"dry\". By dry they meant we couldn't swim in it. The whole environment around the cenotes was excellent and the tour of the cenotes was also excellent. Chikin Ha is open to the public but I would recommend booking through someone as it can become quite busy and the guides know there stuff. Highly recommend this spot!"

Two of the cenotes are open to snorkeling or diving; we snorkeled. They are both rather small for snorkeling; I've been to larger cenotes near Playa, but they were cool, lots of fish and interesting flora and formations. I'm sure if you dive, you get to see a lot more, but I'm not a diver just yet. I thought it was a bit expensive for what you get, but maybe this was because we only snorkeled. Still, it was a cool experience. The ceremonial cenote was really beautiful too. If you are prone to getting chilly, wear a wetsuit. I'm glad I did because I was warm enough to snorkel all of them comfortably. We went when there weren't a lot of people, but if it had been crowded, it wouldn't have been as fun since they are smaller cenotes."

I strongly recommend this cavern or any cavern for the diving enthusiast. Not recommended if you have any sorts of claustrophobia; an English diver in our group had to call the dive towards the end of the first dive simply because of this. Also, diver should be self reliant in diving and gear and have proper buoyancy skills. Other than that, the Cenotes are an amazing place to dive."

We were offered a $250 peso self explore, which we chose, or a $500 peso adventure with zip lines. My 8 year old was not charged. We did not pick up a free life jacket because we all swim well but wish we had for the kids. The fresh water is not as buoyant as the sea. We went to the furthest cenote first, which is beautiful but you can't swim. The middle one is partly in a cave and is magical. No artificial lights needed, just enough day light filters in. The closest one is uncovered and picturesque but the water does not have the same amazing quality as the covered one. My husband spotted a blue morpho butterfly Highly recommended trip, even though it is expensive. We did not use changing facilities. Only 5 cars were there when we arrived at midday so it was really quiet."

You can snorkel in 2 of the 3 cenotes (the third one you walk through). It is absolutely beautiful, crystal clear water. We spent hours snorkeling in the open/partially covered cenote and the second cave cenote. The third one you can walk down into, but not snorkel in it. Snorkeling you realize just how deep these caves are and there are scuba divers even deeper down in the darkness of the underwater caves - all you see is the glow of their headlamps.

I'm a big wimp about cold water and was concerned I would hate it but once I was in it was no problem. There had been quite a lot of rain in the days before we were there and that causes the water to be a bit cloudy but even then it was an amazing and unique experience. The underground portion takes about 45 minutes and you swim in underground caverns and swim/walk through underground caves filled with rock formations, it's truly spectacular. If you are in the Yucatan make sure you check out a cenote, it's truly amazing!"

There is an open cenote, a cave cenote and another grotto cenote that is sacred and you do not swim in. All very nice and refreshing for a visit. They were working on installing some ziplines to do when you visit as well. We were there in the off season, and although there were wires up, there was no ziplining, so we asked the girl at the desk if we could get a reduced price, and she lowered it from 300 pesos to 250 pesos, so about $6 per cenote. Lovely area, well marked paths, at the two in which you could swim, there were also some scuba divers doing cave dives, who were deep below you following their rope trails. It was neat to see them, as the water was very clear. And we just watched the movie The Cave, which was about cave diving, and filmed down the road at Hidden Worlds. Yes, the water is cooler, but you are in Mexico, and its always hot, so it doesn't take long to adjust to the cooler water. They have changing rooms, bathrooms and showers here. Also equipment rentals if you didn't bring yours. Check it out for a nice half day trip."

There is stone around the area to enter the water. The water is clear and you can see the bottom clearly. At the time of my visit, there were some areas with floating leaves on top of the water. Looking around at the bottom, there is a lot of algae and dead leaves and such. There were not many fish which was disappointing. I expected there to be more life inside the cenote. The second one they called a river. It was a short cave with 2 openings. It is relatively dark inside. The water is clear. Looking down, you see rock and dark crevices. Since the sun does not reach inside the cave very much at all, this space is absent color, sort of grey.The third was also a cave but you are not allowed to swim. It's pretty to see. There's a big opening with a ring like little body of water around the edge. Very slick down there, so be careful if you go in to take a look.So, this place is interesting. I'm happy I had the opportunity to see it. But, I gave it average because I really expected to see more life in the water. I would not recommend paying for the extra activities as I didn't see where that would be a good use of time there. They did seem to be making improvements on property at the time of my visit."

The grounds around the cenote are well maintained and clean. There was a rudimentary restroom and changing area... more substantial than what you find at most cenotes, though. Admission was 300 pesos (~$20 USD at the time), which is really steep compared to other cenotes in the area. I think you are paying for access to the scuba-ing cenotes on site, and the better maintained facilities. Your admission includes use of a life vest if desired, access to two cenotes for swimming/snorkeling, and one cenote for just looking/visiting (it appears to be a sacred site). The first cenote you access is just slightly murky with vegetation, but there are still lots of fish to see. The second cenote is crystal clear and very, very deep and cold. No vegetation at all in this one. This is where people do the scuba diving. It is obviously better for scuba than snorkeling, but I still enjoyed snorkeling here and watching the scuba divers take off on their adventures. I also really enjoyed visiting the sacred cenote... you could see scuba divers under the surface, which was unexpected and interesting. All in all, I would not recommend this cenote if you only want to snorkel/swim, but if you feel like spending more to see a very unique site, go for it! We enjoyed it."

The light beams contrasted beautifully with the dark, deep, abysses where you couldn't see the bottom. My husband got a little claustrophobic inside (a lot of the cavern has low head room), but I had a great time.

A relatively short walk to our first viewing point via a shower and the toilets. You cannot wear suncream or chemical mosquito products here. This was not a problem for us, but be aware trees / water = mosquitoes. We were shown 2 underground areas one of which is a religious area where a shaman will apparently smoke bad spirits out of you!! Or something similar. We then went for our first dip in a beautifully clear watered pool, a bit chilly to start with but once your in your in. Once back out we sat on the path leading out of the area, with our feet in the water. An abundance of little fish then came up to clean our feet.

The water is cold, cold, COLD, but is a unique experience, clear waters, so pure. The service was good. The tickets cheap, they have clean bathrooms, which is very difficult to find in any xenote, and the little restaurant was good. I do recommend this place 100%"

Of course be smart enough to go with an expert guide, and don't try to be a cave whisperer (can be fatal), follow the protocols for cavern diving, and listen to your guide (they will brief you on everything). The bugs kinnda bite, but the dive experience is outstanding. There are no squeeze areas, and make sure you have a backup light (its very dark without it)."

What I dint realise is that we had to walk down a dirt road for 1 1/2 kms to get there. It was incredibly hot and the mozzies were swarming. BUT it was all worth it !! There is a set of 3. The first is gorgeous with clear water and lots fish and turtles. The second cenote is under a cavern. It looks scarey to begin with but take the plunge and get in, it's wonderful and so different to the other cenotes we went to days earlier. There are a few bats inside but they a don't bother you. Water is cool but there's no need for wetsuits. The last cenotes is not for swimming. It's a big cave with water around the edges. There appears to be a 'temple' of sorts inside. The day we went it smelled of Frankinsense which added to the allure. Take water, organic sunblock and repellant. The cost was a bit expensive $18 per person, some of the other cenotes (Azul & Cristellino) we're only $6 each."

            "review": "Kin - Ha Cenote / Zip line / 4 wheeler. So here we are on the beach at our resort and we get approached by a young man named Benjamin who starts his sales pitch with us regarding all the tours his company provides and how much money we will save by going through them instead of through the hotel. Last year we had done expeditions through the hotel and they were nice and you paid for it, however they were all day long, and this trip was around 4 hours. After thinking it over and realizing how much we could potentially save financially and how it was only 4 hours long we decided to go for it! The van picked us up at 9:00 am, not the best van, not the worst, but to be expected, we paid slightly more for a private tour - did not have to pick up anyone else from other resorts worth it in my opinion. We traveled for about 30 minutes, switched vehicles when we got to a rough dirt road, hoped in the 4 door pick up truck (new truck) traveled another few miles and we were at our destination. This place is in the middle of the jungle for real, super cool very laid back environment. They got right to business signing waivers, taking money, explaining the rules, gave us a locker to put our things in (change of clothes, phones, money, etc) Before we knew it we were on our 4 wheelers heading down the rough dirt road which was pretty fun, they go over the operation of the 4 wheelers thoroughly and you get a helmet and goggles and a life vest (for cenote). After about 15-20 minutes of cruising through dirt roads and jungle we got to the cenote. This place was really cool its like a big crater in the earth, water was very clear and clean, 2 zip lines, 4 or 5 different platforms (cliff jumping) to jump from. The highest is 55 feet, we did the 45 footer and that was awesome! The zip lines were a lot of fun as well, we had a group of about 10 of us and the only people that did the zip lines and cliffs was our party and 2 others so we could just keep jumping and zip lining without waiting. We were there for about 45 minutes, then back on the 4 wheelers and back to the base camp destination were we started. They took our lunch order (burger, fries, and water - other options too, watch out for the HOT sauce it is HOT and delicious if you like that stuff) While we waited we walked the grounds and went to another cenote, this one was basically completely under ground really cool like a cave with stilagtites or stilagmites, water was cold (under ground) theres a narrow slot that you can jump (15-20 foot) through to get down or you can take the stairway, we opted for the jump which was awesome. Got some cool photos down there, then the group got together we took a short walk around the grounds and got to the next zip lines from the tree tops. There is 2 zip lines there both pretty long and fun. Afterwards lunch was ready and delicious! They have a photographer that follows you on your journey and at the very end there is an area where he shows you your personal photos that you can purchase, or you can purchase a DVD with all your photos on it for $40.00 we opted for that as he took some great action shots. Our guide was Remmy and he was very cool, very laid back, very positive, and also very informative. No complaints at all from this party, it was myself, my girlfriend, and her teen-age daughter and we all had a blast!!! Highly recommended!! Thanks Kin-Ha keep up the great work!"

The paths throughout are well-maintanied and easy to walk, with clear signs to help you get around, because it is a pretty big place overall.There is an \"open\" cenote, which is wide and sunny, surrounded by tropical foliage, and full of beautiful fish and underwater flora. It is perfect for snorkeling or just lazily swimming in the cool refreshing water. There is a small set of wooden steps to help you in if you do not want to just jump- this was good for our six-year-old who was a bit timid. Some areas are deep and it is amazing to just float along and look through the crystal clear water and see the rugged bottom.There is a \"closed\" cenote. It is like a cave tunnel and you can swim from one end to the other. It was fascinating. Of course, because there is no sun to warn the water, this cenote is pretty chilly, so you will probably not linger in the water too long. It is fun though, and a bit thrilling as you swim through the dark water with the stone roof over you. I will admit, I was a bit scared, but that is because I have a fear of the dark. Silly me... :)There is a sacred cenote that you are not allowed to swim in, but is so lovely and peaceful It is kind of underground, but not completely, and there are lots of openings in the ceiling of the cenote. The tree roots that have made their way through the limestone rock and are trailing down to the water and earth below are incredible to see. The water in this is so still and so blue. It does feel like a magical place.I have visited other cenotes (Cenote Azul is another one I like a lot), but this one beats them all! GO!!!! Take your snorkel gear. You will love it!!!"

Our guy was fun and stayed with us the entire time. We had a very inexperienced group and only snorkeled but always felt as our guide was with us and keeping an eye on us. The zip lines both went over water and had great views. Also for lunch, the empenadas were basically a $1 each and were amazing.

Wow!!!!The folks who run this place are polite and curtious, grounds are clean and presentable. Plenty of parking and paths are smooth to travel for the most part....I WILL be back....Tell em', \"Chicago Joe\" sent You...."

We were brought here by a private tour guy name George who insisted this is the best cenote in the area. I pressed him to stop here at the beginning of the day but he pushed back saying the water is to cold at 10 in the morning. I explained to him that this isn't my first rodeo, and all cenotes are cold regardless of time of day. So he took us to Akumal first and then to the cenote. I should have known better when we pulled in and the driver to a wink and a smile from the guy in the booth at the entrance. He opened the doors to the van and basically said see you in 3 hours. We were never told that you should buy the expensive option for the best experience, so we bought the basic tour for $25 USD. The basic tour was, well, basic. Walk yourself to the cenotes and have at it. The first one looked like a swamp and when I told the group to jump in, they thought I was nuts. The second one was nice, but just a basic pool of water under a partial cave. The third one had a layer of white scum over it, so nobody dared enter. We were there for a total of 40 minutes. When we got back to the van, George was really surprised to see us and wasn't happy when I told him to take us back to Akumal so we could hang out at La Buena Vida. Funny thing is there was a brochure for Kantun-Chi cenote which is right next door. It looked awesome, and I would say worth a shot before trying the frickin Chikin....."

We went into 2 different caves and swam around with Paco our guide who also happened to be quite attractive. We did rappel into the cave, I liked that and was not frightened at all like some of the men and women. We zip lined into the water but when you do this water goes up your nose so be prepared. After that there was 2 zip lines thru the forest you have to climb very high towers which are almost vertical so if you are not in good shape don't do it. I am a 44 year old and had no problem at all. There was a lunch at the farm it was traditional Mayan food which was a bit bland but fine. The juice was from flowers and yummy. After that we went to Tulum and saw the ruins and beach and there was some tourist flea market type things along the park road. The water was a bit rough there and I did not go in very far. Lots of stairs to go down to the beach so its not good for people with mobility issues."

The Cenote is owned by a family who look after it really well. There is plenty of plants and wildlife to look at as you move between the various cenotes.Our excursion gave us the chance to snorkel in two of them and view another. The first swimmable was in a cave. The water was freezing, but the sight of all the limestone rock both above and below the water was amazing. The second was like an underground garden. Beautiful flowers and loads of fish and turtles, dragonflies, butterflies, etc.It's such a peaceful place and looks as though it is never too busy. It was nice to find something new to enjoy that I would never have considered anyway. If cenotes is your thing, then I definitely reccomend Chikin Ha due to it's variety of cenotes."

Because it gets direct sunlight, plants and such grow in the water. If you save that one for last, you will want to shower off. BUT, if you snorkle in the larger cave cenote last, you can kind of rinse off in it. Also, the water is colder than you might expect but it will help reduce the itching and swelling of the mosquito bites you are sure to get while walking the paths! :)"

Our tour guide Giovanni was great and spoke good English, the cenotes were outstanding, water was crystal clear and quite cold, and the photographer was great. Didn't think much of the lunch (empanadas and banana cake) but overall this was a great experience and superb value for money."

The fruits were delightful and the avocado delicious. They even had hibiscus flower juice which we enjoyed especially as we ate them as children. There was ziplining, both a short one and a longer one, over the water. Then kayaking, which was lots of fun, including crashing into the embankment and eachother now and then. We even went into a small cave like area, very nice. Heading back to the end was like the amazing race :) was alot of fun. Ended with swimming in the cenotes, water was crystal clear and very cool, there was even a jumping platform. And for those just wanting to relax, there were some hammocks, looked heavenly. All in all a wonderful experience and so convenient to have all these activities in one place, makee it easy."

Akumal (tortuga bay) snorkeling and Chikin Ha cenotes are close enough to Playa del Carmen and to one another to do them in less than a full day. Yes, there are probably better, more amazing cenotes, but we had a great guide (Lada, and adorable russian with near-perfect english) and the cenotes were very neat, water was clear and cool, and the photographer (Gonza) was excellent (CD with all pics, no videos, was $25 US). Whether or not you are there with a group, try an empanada, they are fabulous!"

            "review": "Excellent Cave Diving!. 3/23/14 - Incredible first dive of the day. Easy entry over stepped rocks into the crystal clear waters of the Chikin Ha Cenote system. Dive over boulders in the cavern zone for ten minutes before reaching the tie in for the cave section. Beautiful shafts of light piecring the light-green algae covered surface. After a 100foot jump on a reel over to the main line of the cave, which went from florida gold line to Danny Riordin's braided nylon. the delicate sculpted and scalloped limestone was so delicate, that even our bubble brought down a light rain of small rocks. Tiny albino shrimp, smaller than a grain of rice, were caught in our cave lights as we pushed through the dark passages. The field of limeston, sculpted by years of acidic water from above, often looked like fields of bones. Finning was careful through these sections, but they always seemed to open up into larger rooms. Well, until they didn't - we turned at ~52 minutes in not on thirds (my SAC rate was ~.55 on the entire dice) but due to a combination of new silt, calcium silt, and limestone dropping from above. On exit a large rock, perhaps 3ft wide, broke loose and struck my legs as we passed. Could have found the line faster, but situation was handled well. Good thing it didn't whack Juan's head - I was leading out. On the way out the Halocline (layers of water separated by salt and fresh water) were far clearer as I was leading the dive instead of following. We ran about five minutes faster out due to my longer legs and the slight flow that pushed us gently out of the cave. Decompression in an open area of the basin afforded us the ability to watch the snorklers puddling above us and tour divers following the cavern line. We both surfaced at 111 minutes, smiling and laughing and agreeing that this had been an enjoyable day. Can't wait for tomorrow."

He has made this place a magical wonderland for himself and his staff. They are all like family and its very nice. We hung out with a young fellow named Sebastien ,who was just adorable. He showed us around the cenote & took me over to the sweat lodge. It is used in Mayan rituals on full moon's they use special leaves & bark to burn the rocks that heat the lodge. The leaves & wood have a very distinct aromatic smell that is memorable.After you steam at night on the full moon you can cool down in the cenote. They have a shaman at this paticular cenote & a special cenote just for his ceremony's. You won't find this at any of the 6 or so one's I visited. The place is a very short cab ride down a dirt road across from the main town in Playa. You can swim here, snorkel or have a shaman fix you up. Each cenote has there own vibe this one is very close to my heart."

The water is kinda cold and deep, but I think it is so neat to know that you can swim in the same water as the ancient Mayans. The history of the Cenotes are really interesting as well. The cenote at Chichen Itza has a cliff where you can dive into the water. There are life jackets that you can rent for three dollars, but my husband and I chose to just swim without one, and it was fine. There are a lot of vines hanging in the water, and you aren't allowed to touch them, so you can preserve the cenote, but it was pretty awesome."
