My japan Friend told me this is the place with most number of Tokyo bananas counters. Each retail outlet sells different variations. Some shops may not have tax free or rebates. So check it out before you made payment. There is 2 levels of food and shopping streets. It has more Japan cute cartoons merchandise than you can imagine. Rilakuma cartoon toys of japan edition if you are interested. There is also a specialise Calbee counter that sells specialised potato chips. Every thing comes in small packages. Just beware of the different counters sell different varieties of Tokyo Bananas. Some shops closed at exactly at 8:30 pm.Recommend to spent at least 2 hours here. Even if you don't buy anything, just browse and see how the Local and tourist shop at this place. As this is the main interchange for Tokyo to other cities by train. There are many commuters that have their luggage bags. Beware not let thRan over you. Lockers are available for you to store your bags for a fee. "

We will be taking the JR train from Osaka to Narita Airport in ten days.

This building which looks a little bit like the Marches shopping centre in Dundalk is THE CENTRE for all public traffic in Tokyo. The station is larger than many of the European airports and you will need a map for it! Gladly they have maps for this station. If you are want to visit Tokyo and have no clue at all about Japan or the city just go to the nearest station which is offering access to the Yamanote Line and just exit at every major station and you will be able to see many famous stuff. (This worked great for me and once I was more confident with the public transportation system I was brave enough to take smaller trains and even buses)Using this tactic you will come along this building and all the chaos inside it. You have from one side the Marshes Shopping Centre style entrance which is famous for photo shoots and probable the only exit you can make good photos off as you will have skyscrapers on all other corners. Please note that this isn`t a shopping centre in Dundalk but one of the most busiest places in the largest metropolitan area of the world. It is loud, busy and by times so crowded that you have issues to move to another lane of people. This is the reason why I tried to get as fast as possible outside this building."

It's great coming into Tokyo on the JR line from the main airport but I can't say I rave for the underground system as a whole as it is sprawling, and takes you a few days to master(?) - the main problem is that there is a whole underground system of walkways which link up everything that when you go down you turn a corner and find you are in a department store, or have to walk 200 metres to find the line you want, keeping your eye closely on whichever coloured circle you want for the line. When you get the train they are fast, clean and efficient, and wider than the London ones, for example. Not the most fund experience but it gets you there; and there are uniformed helpers, who are helpful, to guide the English speaking travellers in the right direction, very politely, of course, as in all Japan.My top tip for Tokyo: use google maps and drop a pin for where you want to go - and take out a package that allows you to do that at a reasonable price. It's and invaluable way of finding your way around. And if you use the lonely planet guide and have it downloaded on your phone it links automatically to google maps ..."

The underground mall is a maze and we found it easier to enter on the East side of the station, near the Mcdonalds, then taking the first stairway on the left side to the lower level. There are multiple drugstores where you can buy beverages, candy, sundries, and unique Japanese products at affordable prices. On our last trip I bought the Yuzu hair oil for $699 JPY. There are stores selling inexpensive items like bags and other items. The food is wonderful. The Daimaru Department store has a great food hall offering everything imaginable, including bento boxes, fried fish, tempura, sushi, sashimi, French pastry, curry, and rices. A couple of hours before closing most prepared food is marked down by 20% or more. All of the restaurants that we eat at were great for prices between US$10 to US$ 20 per person.There is a breakfast shop that serves choices of tempura with rice, soup, or noodles; another place, called Sandog, offered an affordable choice of coffee, toast and egg; they also offer a wide selection of French pastries.

It is mostly entrances and exits to the JR system, and you cannot access the floor unless you have a ticket.Make your way underground and it is a whole different world. For foodies, there are the Kitchen Street and Tokyo Ramen Street, where you can find around ten ramen stores located close together. Just head towards the Yaesu underground shopping mall, near the Daimaru departmental store. There are other food options at the ends of the corridors, such as MacDonalds, pizza and pasta joints, and you should also check out Granroof, as well as the various statues dotted around.Nearby, there is also Character Street, where small shops are dedicated to various characters such as Hello Kitty, Pokemon and Ultraman."

It's very confusing, especially with the construction going on in many places within the station. The signs aren't very clear, and though the Japanese are very very nice they really don't speak English so you're basically going around in circles. Using this as a way station can be a challenge. I have a friend who came in at 11pm and got to the hotel at 1230 because she could not find the street exit of the station. The passages inside the station are several kilometers long. BUT there is an area full of interesting restaurants, and Character Street, which has themed toy stores (which i loved). And the central facade is beautiful. So for me it's worth going to at least once. The rest of my trip I stuck to Shinjuku station because I found it easier to negotiate.

Accessibility and signage for the majority of standard JR lines (such as Yamanote) and Shinkansen lines are extremely good. The one exception is the Narita Express (NEX). In a city as well organised as Tokyo, passengers arriving from or departing to Narita, typically with large suitcases, should not have to go down 3 sets of escalators to the bottom basement of Tokyo station. Ironically 3-4 mins after leaving the station, the train is above ground. Hopefully before the 2020 Olympics, JR will operate the NEX from surface, making it significantly easier and pleasant for arriving and departing Travellers."

There are the usual shopping centres and food courts in and around the station, including the so-so ramen street and the interesting tokyo character street, plus the building is nice from the outside (except for the construction in front of it at the moment), but I don't think it's a destination in itself."

Trains depart on a frequent schedule (always exactly punctual) and are the best way to travel around Japan and Tokyo. We took the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto and return and travelled in comfortable reserved seats at 100 to 120 miles per hour ( up to 200 KMH) We took the Yamanote Line ( a downtown loop) to the Tokyo National Museum and Ueono Park. There is a great shopping street ( Amereyoko Dori) near the station.The train station itself might be one of the biggest shopping malls in the world. Kitchen Street near Nihombashi North Exit and our Hotel Metropolitan Maranouchi has around twenty places to eat We had good Sushi served by a girl who spent a couple years in California (great English Speaker) at #7. We had fruit/desert/breakfast at #1. The department store is a must see destination. The two basement floors have a hundred food stalls with deluxe take-out. The upper levels are high-end shopping.I recommend that you plan to eat at the station at least twice if you are in Tokyo a few days. Plan 2-3 hours just to walk around the shops and the area.I am so disappointed in the Government in the US that we spend hundreds of billions every 5-6 years on emergency economic stimulus and have never developed a world class train system. High speed service makes so much sense between New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington DC. High speed service between LA and San Diego or service around San Francisco, LA, and San Diego might help with traffic jams that are totally out of control.I would like to commend the JR Train Company for superior service during my visit on 31 March 2016. We arrived at Kyoto Station early for our transfer from Kyoto to Tokyo. My wife broke a toe on 29 March and we were concerned about how we could make the transfer. We stopped in at the JR Information office and we were greeted promptly by a volunteer who spoke English. She walked with us to the JR ticket office to arrange a wheelchair and then helped us find a pharmacy for bandages and tape. The ticket agent saw we could make an earlier train to Tokyo and changed our reserve seats for us (No ticket change fee), called a wheelchair escort, and then called Tokyo Station to arrange a wheelchair on the other end. The service at the Tokyo side far exceeded my imagination. A wheel chair escort greeted us at the track. The train crew signaled to my wife to sit and wait and then exit directly to the wheelchair. The escort pushed my wife to the Nihombashi North exit which is equivalent to two blocks. Then, the escort took my wife out of the station to the Hotel Metropolitan Marinouchi which is 50 meters from the exit. He pushed her all the way to the hotel elevator and I got a new wheelchair and escort for her in the lobby. We travel with my mother-in-law and find wheelchair service at the airport to be spotty, even when arranged in advance. We had an injury and unplanned need. JR Train Staff exceeded all my expectations. The Tokyo Train Station and JR Rail are the best I have ever seen."

            "review": "So huge! Beautiful Face! But chances are you may get lost.... Tokyo Station is one of the few stations in Tokyo in which many will no doubt experience the feeling of getting lost.Similar to Shinjuku Station, it\u2019s a large railway station that is like a labyrinth.Located in the Marunouchi business district of Chiyoda, Tokyo, it is the main intercity rail terminal in Tokyo and the busiest station in Japan (over 3,000 trains per day) and the fifth-busiest in Eastern Japan.But it\u2019s also a station which one can find a plethora of shops and for architect enthusiasts, it\u2019s one of the few that features a brick-built facade. In fact, the main station facade has been around since it first opened back in 1914.Designed by architect Tatsuno Kingo (designer of the Manseibashi Station and nearby Bank of Japan building), who was influenced by his travels to Europe. Tokyo Station was created in Neo-Baroque design and used extensive steel framing and red brick with ribbed domes crowning the north and south wings of the structure.The steel framing for the building was imported from England and because of the structure, it survived the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 and the bombings of World War II (a large part of the station was destroyed on May 25, 1945 during a B-29 bombing, including the destruction of the rooftop domes but quickly rebuilt a year later).A restoration of the building was completed in 2012, which included the restoration of the domed roof structures.While Tokyo Station was one of his famous designs, Kingo would unfortunately become a victim of the 1918 flu pandemic and die in 1919.Currently if you visit Tokyo Station, you will notice construction currently being done next to the main facade.Featuring 10 island platforms serving 20 tracks, there are tracks on top level, underground and the walk from area to area is quite a distance, so have your comfortable shoes ready and as for Google Maps, don\u2019t depend on it while inside, because it will keep pointing for you to go to one direction and then another and personally, it\u2019s just best to follow the directions you see hanging from the train sections before entering a hallway.Also, good for one to know the various trains knowing which are JR East (green), JR Central (which is typically the shinkansen a.k.a. \u201cbullet train) and Tokyo Metro (Marunouchi Line) in blue.If you arrived from Narita to Tokyo Station, the first thing I recommend is getting a Suica (preferred) or Passpo card, so you can deposit money into it and start using it immediately when traveling from station to station.But Tokyo Station is no doubt one of the areas one should visit if they enjoy seeing unique structures in Tokyo. Tokyo Station is no doubt one of Japan\u2019s wonderful structures to take a photo of during the day and night but also, for one who wants to initiate themselves in train station business, Tokyo Station is the place."

It is extremely easy to find your way as the sinage is very clear. You may find some of the ticketing machines confusing, but don't worry -- there are people to help you. On my last trip to Tokyo, 2 weeks ago, I needed to buy a ticket on the Narita Express to the airport. One of my colleagues decided that he could beat the machine, and insisted on using it. I went into the ticket office, waited my turn, told the attendant what I needed, and walked out with my ticket. He was just finishing playing with the machine, but it turned out that somehow, he ended up buying a first class ticket, which he didn't want or need.The bullet trains leave about every 3 minutes, so make sure you're getting on the right one. The platforms indicate where the numbered rail card stop, important since tickets are for a specific seat on a specific car. Before I forget, there are also lots of shops and restaurants in the station. If you're leaving the station, use the maps to figure out which exit is right for you."

On a recent trip to Japan, I had 2 trips to Tokyo which required a stop at Tokyo Central Railway Station which were my first in over 20 years.Both required that I transfer to different lines, both of which are located outside the main station (one several blocks away).I was pleased to see that new signs with Japanese and English were posted compared to my previous visit at which time all signs had been changed to Japanese only.The one downside is that even with all for he signage in English (and there were a lot of signs), none clearly gave indication on where you needed to go.An example of this is if you need the Ginza or Marunoichi lines (the entrance is located on the northeast section of the station).Approaching from the westside (outside of the gates), there are no signs giving instructions on indication where to go for these lines. If one sees the signs inside the gates, you are given the impression that access is available from within the Central station which is not the case.After following the signs, one will quickly realize that they lead you to the central exit gate on the eastside which now requires you exit at the manned station to avoid paying (if using a SUICA or PASMO card).Now once you exit the station, guess what? There are NO signs indicating where to go for access to the subway station or lines!!!Word of advice, turn right and follow the sidewalk and up ahead you will see the stairwell access just around the side of the main terminal building. Make sure to keep walking towards it and the signs will be visible once you are near the north entrance/exit (but only viewable from the exit).The Central Station needs better sign placement along with improved indication of which way to go and which exits provide access to certain streets or transportation (taxi, bus subway etc.).Hopefully this items will be improved upon before the Olympics in 2020 to avoid having a station full of confused and irritated foreigners taking up what little time station employees (if you can find one to talk to) for assistance."

It is the main platform for the high speed Shinkansen rail lines & the Tokyo Metro Network which include Tokaido, KeiHin-Tohoku, Yamanote, Chuo, Sorbu, Yokosuka, Keiyo and Marounochi lines. The station is linked with underground passageways to the Otemachi underground subway metro station which serves the Hanzamon, Mita, Chiyoda and Tozai lines. Entrance to the station is via the north, central and southern Maronouchi Exits on the western side and the Yaesu North, Central and South exits. Within this station is licated the Tokyo Station Hotel, the Shangrila Hotel, Daimaru Shopping Centre and many other shopping and eateries. The kitchen street has has many restaurants that serve all sorts of cuisines. Ob the basement of the Daimaru Shopping complex is a supermarket that you canbget all your needs and a wuick bite if you are in the run. Ticketing machines are conveniently located at all the entrances and you need to know where you are going to get the right ticket. Have no fear if you underpaid the ticket as there are fare adjustment machines at the exits of the various stations. It is from this station that you can take a bus/Narita express train to Narita airport or the high speed rail to any part of japan. It is convenient and centrally located. Its facade is historic. Most tourist buses stop nearby at the southern exit.E"

Tokyo station is a huge complex. the old facade is an architectural homage to Central Station in Amsterdam. The brick and stone construction is a juxtaposition against the other modern buildings that have been built around it. It is a seemingly confusing arrangement of gates , shops and people, but once locating the JR ticket office, the level of information and service is wonderful. I usually get yelled at at Penn station from asking too many questions. At Tokyo station, service is paramount, so don't be afraid to stop any JR employee to ask directions.In addition to be a place for travel, it's also a place to eat, shop and spend time with friends. On our last trip, we had some time to kill, so we put our bags in a locker and went to find a place to eat. Downstairs we found a complete mall with some of the most delightful eateries and bakeries around. I'm not talking hotdogs and pretzels either. Everything from coffee and wonderful French style vienoiserie to Japanese Bento boxes that would blow ones culinary mind...and everything in between. And as if this was not enough, there are several new buildings attahced to the Staqtion complex that host their own shops and stores (The Daimaru department store with it's food gastronomic wonderland food hall, the Kitte building with all it's shops, restaurants and Brew Pub). I cold ;literally spend a day at the station and still have more to see.On top of this all, Japan Rail runs on such an exact timing, that trains are never delayed. Since we booked reserved seats, we always knew where our car would stop and that it would be on time. Announcements were made in English as well as Japanese, so it makes it very easy to get around. This is also true wiht the other stations we stopped at (Kyoto Station (mind blowing) , Nagano, Osaka (really mind blowing) and Sendai.its a great place to start or finish a trip."

We ate dinner here several times such was the convenience and we loved the extensive food halls in the basement of the Diamaru department store."

There are many quirky shops and souvenir shops within the ticketing gates but to really experience the magnitude and grandeur exit the station through the Maranouchi Central exit which is on the historic side of the building. If you want to take a decent picture walk directly across the street to the shin-Maranouchi bulding and go to the 5th floor. there is a deck allowing a good vantage point for taking pictures. Be sure to walk around and check out the many resturants on the 5th floor. On the North Maranouchi exit a corridor connects to the Yaseu side of the station. Along this corridor are more resturants and souvenir shops. The Yaseu side has a vast array of resturants at the street level and if you are adventourous enough to venture to the basement there are many underground walkways filled with more resturants to cater to the busy travellers and office workers. If you have ample time you might want to check out the KITTE building across the street on the South Maranouchi exit. The old post office building has been restored to its former glory and pocked with many quirky and interesting shops and resturants."

However there was one negative experience in a month's stay in this wonderful country that I still can't forget. My wife and I visited Tokyo's Central Station last November. In the shopping area outside the ticket validation area there was one small Men's and Women's toilet. So small for the thousands of shoppers and visitors that the queue for each of these toilets extended into the area outside. Due to the queue my wife used the Disabled Toilet without any problems. When I needed to go I also found myself behind a queue of waiting men, so used the same Disabled Toilet. After a couple of minutes a woman started knocking on the door and calling out. I couldn't finish what I was doing and couldn't speak Japanese either, except for \"Hai\". She still kept on knocking and calling out. A minute or so later a man spoke on the loudspeaker in the ceiling of the toilet. When I was finally able to finish my job, there were so many buttons with Japanese I didn't know which to press. I finally opened the door, and found the woman who had been constantly knocking on the door. She was in her early twenties and not disabled, I have the toilet prostrate problem most men in their sixties have. Finally due to not understanding the Japanese inscriptions embarrassingly I had to ask her which button to press to flush the toilet. Why are there so few toilets servicing and area with so many people? And why are the instructions in a city with so many foreigners only in Japanese?"

It is a terminus for many of the famous Shinkansen (bullet trains), trains to and from Narita airport, and subway lines.Three important things to remember: first, make sure where you want to go before crossing a ticket gate; secondly, understand that if the bi-lingual (Japanese and English) signs to a certain point suddenly vanish, then you have taken a wrong turn; and finally, if you have to make a connection in Tokyo station, then give yourself enough time for that.There are many levels of shops in this complex, but the only ones I have really explored are the beautiful ekiben: boxed lunches to be eaten on trains. There's a large number of shops, and some of the displays are so beautiful that you will want to photographs them. They are also good to eat.There are a large number of lockers of various sizes for storing baggage, but you may have to explore more than one location to find one free. The machines which control them can be switched from Japanese to English (ticket machines can also switch language). All payments at these machines can be made using cash or smart cards like Suica and Pasmo. Tokyo, like most subway stations have free wifi; you have to register once. Most railway employees are extremely helpful; I've been embarrassed once when one of them came all the way from one gate to another to show me the way."

In the event of an earthquake the building is isolated from the earths movements, reducing the impact on the building and its occupants.For those visiting Tokyo and are fearful of an earthquake probably one of the safest places to stay is the Tokyo Station Hotel which forms part of the building itself."

I thought I had purchased two ways on the fast direct express service - but it doesn't automatically get you that on the way back.I won't touch that horrible service again - TCAT Bus service is quiet, clean, peaceful, fast, reliable, individually seated and leaves from a well sign-posted, immaculately clean, uncrowded, smiling serviced terminal. OH by the way, if you ask why the service is so shocking coming back - the answer - no answer, the guy just closes the office and walks away!What a profound disappointment and what a horrible end of a day experience - NEVER again - Take the bus guys."

The underground level contains a vast shopping mall and eateries so frankly you could stay there all day and never emerge. It's a big interchange for the subway and JR lines so you can get to most places. There are several ticket offices so we just chose the one with the smallest queue to reserve tickets on the train.

So many platforms, so many levels, so many directions, so many people, so little English, so hard to find information.The train from Narita arrived on the lowest level, little did we know. Imagine that signs (and the ticket machines) are in Japanese, not English . . . you should find a tutorial about this station and the Metro before you arrive. Fortunately the lovely staff at the Tokyo Station Hotel were willing and able to orient and coach us so that we rapidly became independently mobile. Ultimately the station and metro system are amazing. Be prepared!"

I was in the rough vicinity as I'd been walking the Imperial Palace East Gardens and so I decided to walk over and take a look at the historic Tokyo Central Railway Station.On approach it is a Grand building that's for sure with its stunning Renaissance-style red-brick work, stone framed arched windows, turrets and domed roof, however when you consider some other global landmark Stations, (such as Grand Central in NY, St. Pancras International in London and Gare du Nord in Paris), this one is not mind blowing, hence the 'Average' rating.Built just over 100 years ago in 1914 the station has recently been through a 5 year period of renovation, including the reinstatement of the original domed roof. In 1945 USA bombing destroyed large parts of the station and post-war the domed roofs were replaced with sloped ones, however it is now back to its pre-war glory and when you go inside the Marunouchi (west) side of the station you can look up and see the magnificent roof decoration and structure.I didn't use the station for travel or to visit its shops and restaurants, but I understand from what I've read that all are to a high standard. The Tokyo Station Hotel is also part of this fine building. In short I am glad I took the time (1/2 hour) to go see and experience this historic railway terminus but it is something I would only need to do the once."

They speak very little English so have your tickets in hand so they can help you if you don't speak Japanese. Departures and arrivals are posted in Japanese and English and the board changes every few seconds. There are plenty of restaurants, everything from specialty chocolates and cakes to full service sit down restaurants, so don't worry about not getting good food. Although there are snacks on the train, don't wait to eat on the train. There are usually just cookies and chips and drinks for sale. There are shops at Tokyo Station also. Attached to Tokyo Station and accessible from the main hall is a multi-level department store, quite pricey name brands, but with lovely clothing, shoes, ties, perfumes, etc. There are maps of the station on line and I would highly suggest having one with you so you can orient yourself, especially if you are leaving the station, as hotels nearby (and connected to the station) often tell you which exit to use to get to them and it is really easy if you look at the map and use the exit they tell you to use. Otherwise, you will have to re-enter the station and go to the correct exit or literally walk around the 3-4 block station to another exit. Also, if you want to make things easy there are 3, 4 and five star hotels literally right outside of the exits from the station, including Tokyo Station Hotel, which is $$$$ and Metropolitan Marunouchi which is less $$$. I saw that a bus station was attached but we did not use that service. Access from the station to the buses was easy, however. We were traveling as tourists on a JR Pass, which is ususally much less expensive than buying separate regular tickets. The JR Pass can be purchased on line by non Japanese Nationals only. It is basically a tourist 1 or 2 week reduced pass if you will be traveling by train frequently. It took about 2 days to receive our vouchers via UPS after placing the order on line. The vouchers cannot be printed on line so give yourself time for the delivery. It took some looking to figure out that what you do is buy the passes on line (they do have a phone number), adult or child, first class or coach and length of time are your only choices. The paper voucher pack arrives via UPS or other overnight service. The voucher has your name, whether you are adult or child and the duration of the pass and starting date (i.e. 7 days beginning the date you arrive so be sure you put the correct arrival date in when you order). When you arrive at the International Airport in Japan you take the paper voucher and your passport to the Japan Rail office and tell them what trains you want to book. You can also do this at the first train station you will use. The voucher must match the passport information. Look at the schedule ahead of time and chose your trains if you can and they will give you tickets to the exact train you want with seat assignments. Would suggest doing this on arrival at the airport or first train station for all of your train travel if possible so you don't have to check in early for every train to get a ticket. When using the train, once in the station go to the window with an attendant and show your pass plus your ticket to get through. The auto machines do not read these. Anyone in this station can help you get to the right track by looking at your ticket."

I specially recommend it for a rainy day as it has a huge underground shopping area and hundred's of restaurants. The famous rahmen street has some of the best rahmen you can eat in Tokyo. Try the ones you can see how they are making the fresh noodles. Daimaru department store has great shops and restaurants, some with great views over the city. Check out the basement food areas and the first floor sweets vendors, some are to die for and if you are lucky you can get tastings. On the Marunouchi side the building of the old Station is very impressive and it has a hotel and restaurants that will make you feel you are in Europe. If you like to spot trains head up to the terrace of the Post Office building (a beautiful building itself) from there you can have a great view over the staion platforms and good photos of the latests models of the Shinkansen. That building is also a mall and has great restaurants. The list of restaurants and shops in the Tolyo Stn./Marunouchi area is endless but a good tip is House in Shin Marunouchi Building. A series of restaurants and bars where you can also sit at a large wrap around terrace overlooking the magnificent Tokyo Station building. There are plenty of lockers to store your stuff in case you are going or comming from somewhere and have time to kill."

The Tokyo Station was renewed only recently, and it became a more enjoyable place than before. I particularly should like to tell you the underground shopping centre.You can just spend your time there while waiting for your train. There are bookshops, a bureau de change, shops for glasses, clothes, Japanese traditional fragrance, paper crafts, souvenirs from all over Japan, etc., but what attracts your attention most is a variety of food shops. One of the largest department stores has their food corner at the basement and it is famous for lumch varieties. Businessmen line up for getting the best at lunchtime every weekday and the queues become longer and longer at the entrance of each shops, snack stands and restaurants. Numbers of places are waiting fr you to satisfy your appetite. You can have takeaways as well, so that you can enjoy your longer trip on the train. Here's God's plenty. Do not miss your train!"

The station complex is architecturally modern and featureless but as a thoroughfare to keep the workers getting to their destinations it is a fantastic web of lines functioning with true Japanese punctuality.Around three million people use this station , dailly, and when you are trying to reroute yourself to the different platforms it can be quite an ordeal."

Any other major station in Tokyo these days has all the stores and shopping and attached hotels that Tokyo station has, but because it is so large and sprawling and connects so many lines, it has some of the longest connection times in the city (Ikebukuro also has some long connections). 10 minutes may not be enough time to make connections between some lines if it is especially crowded or you have kids in tow. From a commuter standpoint, it is one of the least efficient stations around, so I always try to make my connection at another station whenever possible."

There is nothing like it in the US as the closest thing might be Grand Central in NY. And even that falls a bit short in terms of scope of activity.Tokyo Station is in the heart of Tokyo near the Financial District. There are many busy stations in Tokyo as train and subway travel is the life blood of the critical Japanese transportation function. Tokyo station is one of the main hubs of activity and certainly the most iconic amongst stations in Japan. This station is the busiest in terms of train activity but, amazingly enough, only the fifth busiest in Eastern Japan with regard to passenger traffic. If you come through at rush hour, you will find yourself wondering how there could be four stations that can possibly be busier. And the activity goes well into the evening. If you take a train at 11 PM and think that the station will be sparsely used at that time, think again. You will find yourself with plenty of company.In spite of the frenetic activity, the process runs amazingly well. I could not imagine such a system in the US not malfunctioning on a regular basis but Tokyo Station just clicks along day after day. It is unusual for a Japanese train not to run on time barring weather problems! It is truly amazing how it all holds together.Tokyo Station architecture is interesting and the east and west sides (Yaesu and Maranouchi) look completely different. The Yaesu side has a modern look with an arching metallic frontage with pleasing curves in the design while the Maranouchi side was recently given a face lift to look like a beautiful classic structure with a brick fa\u00e7ade. You should take a look at both sides if you have the chance just to see the contrast.The activity within the station is nothing short of awesome constantly full of bustling crowds making their way from one train to the next. It is one of the main hubs in Tokyo along with Shinagawa for the Shinkansen which is the main mechanism to whisk passengers away to other parts of Japan. It is also a major destination for the Narita Express which ushers passengers from the main International airport to Central Tokyo (about a one-hour trip). But the major part of the activity is the local JR Train system which transports people around the Tokyo area including to Yokogawa and other parts of Kanagawa Prefecture as well as Chiba Prefecture and Saitama Prefecture. The number of lines that run through Tokyo Station are mind boggling. Finally, it is worth making mention of the commercial activity built up in and immediately adjacent to the Station. While there is quite a lot on ground level surrounding the facility, what is inside the station and underground puts a whole new perspective on what is available. There are many shops in and around the building to take advantage of the swarming activity. These range from Mom and Pop stores to the high end shops and include the Daimaru Department Store adjacent to the north end of the building. Any shopper who descends down below ground level may think they have died and gone to heaven. Reminiscent of the Dilbert cartoon where he lost his father who disappeared after discovering an all-you-can-eat restaurant and found it challenging to live out the philosophical implications of such a format, the underground shopping at Tokyo Station provides an all-you-can-shop invitation that might tempt a shop-a-holic to find a sleeping bag in order to live in the hallways between opening times. But if you don't have a chance to visit any shops before going through the gates because you want to locate your platform well ahead of schedule, never fear as there are plenty of shops and food opportunities in the ticketed area as well.Overall, it is worth going out of your way to pay a visit to one of Japan's busier stations, if not Tokyo Station then another one that sports supreme bustle. Not only is it a marvel of behind-the-scenes efficiency, it is also a microcosm of Japanese society. The orderliness that underlies the chaos can only be made possible by the Japanese approach to their daily lives. At the same time, it is an interesting study of the good and the bad. The said efficiency is impressive but then there is the occasional person in the evening who is drunk and falling over or who can't walk a straight line. Witnessing the busyness of the workaday 12 - 16 hours in the lives of countless Japanese salarymen, particularly in Tokyo, produces as much head shaking as their clock-like efficiency prompts envy. It's truly a glimpse into the underlying culture that today is Tokyo and, to a great extent, represents Japan."

The great destruction became a turning point from Taisho Democracy era of freedom and flourished economy after WWI to political and economic turmoil of early Showa era lead to WWII. For some of foreigners, the design and ornaments of the building might be yucky mixture of Western style and orientalism. But for Japanese, the old building was a kind of symbol of good days in mixture of Western culture, Asian and Japanese tradition without big conflict. So, it is the place of nostalgia. The original building was destructed just after 6 years of its completion. Nothing will be forever, but, I hope this building stands hundreds of years, at least until its copper roofing colors into green patina."

All of the train platforms are easily found with the handout provided when you purchase your tickets. All platforms are easy to see and read for your ease. I suggest you purchase your Bento at one of the Bento shops along the way as they are better and less expensive than purchasing one on the train. When you come back to Tokyo station, you can walk to hotels which are within easy walking distance, however if you have luggage, I would suggest a Taxi which are not expensive. Old Tokyo is also within walking distance or again, taxi if you have luggage. If you are heading back to the International airports or have another location visit, again, taxis will know where to take you if you provide a location. Buses are available for transporting you back to the airports. I was apprehensive my first time at Tokyo Station, but once we were there, we found it easy to navigate. Food convenience stands are readily available as are bathrooms. Our Trip to Sendai was a couple hours long. The Shinkanzen travels at a great speed which is smooth and comfortable. If you want to ride for fun, go to Tokyo Station and plan your trip. The Shinkanzen can be expensive depending on your destination but a great experience.

We used the info desk several times. Food vendors there have good selection. We stored our luggage at the lockers outside of McDonalds. Used the largest lockers to store multiple luggage and carry-ons. The payment machine accepted our Passmo/Suica cards.

I took loads of photos of these beautiful locomotive shapes. In particular I like the Shinkansen Nozomi Bullet Train.The main station facade on the western side of the station is brick-built, from the time when the station opened in 1914. The main station consists of 10 island platforms serving 20 tracks, raised above street level..The Shinkansen lines are on the east side of the station, with a multi-story Daimaru department store.The whole complex is linked by an extensive system of underground passageways which merge with surrounding commercial buildings and shopping centres. I fully recommend it as a day out for site seeing and eating out and just seeing the throbbing centre of Tokyo. A was a great experience for me. I hope it will be for you."

We arrived here on the Shinkansen bullet train from Osaka and needed to catch the Narita Express train to get to the airport. We were in a hurry and didn't leave ourselves tons of extra time. As we exited the Shinkansen area, we had to feed both of our tickets into the machine. For 3 of the peolpe in our party, one of the two tickets came back out on the other end of the machine, but for our son, neither of the tickets came out on the other end. We didn't think anything of it - after all, we were done with the trip, so why would we need those tickets anyway? However, when we went to buy Narita Express tickets, the agent demanded to see our tickets for how we get to the Tokyo station. I'm guessing they have a big problem with people buying tickets who aren't actually physically there (sarcasm intended)??? What difference does it make how we got there? What if I walked in? What if I took a taxi? In any case, he refused (quite rudely) to sell us tickets since we didn't have all 4 ticket stubs for our arrival. We had to go back to the place where we exited the Shinkansen train area and ask someone for the missing ticket stub. This all sounds simple enough, but try getting across what you are looking for to people who do not speak any English. It takes a while. All this to say that we were greatly delayed by this run-around and ended up running all the way to our plane, barely making it. I can't imagine the purpose of this ridiculous policy of demanding proof of how you arrived to the Tokyo station, but it needs to be abolished yesterday!!!"

The station itself is vast and built over multiple levels. It is organised according to the names of the major train lines and each of the main gates have different names (ie Yaesu Central, Yaesu North, Yaesu South, Nihombashi, Maruouchi North, Marououchi central etc). We were heading for the JR East travel centre which is tucked in the Maruouchi North entrance of the station, we had done our research and were looking for the historic facade of the station featured in all the photos. We were thrown somewhat when our taxi driver dropped us on the other side of the station which bears no resemblence to the photos and is nowhere near the travel center! A useful tip if you are going to the JR travel centre by taxi is to ask the taxi driver to take you to the Tokyo Station Hotel which is directly adjacent to the North Gate (Something we weren't aware of at the time). If you are catching a train use Hyperdia, the online timetable will identify the platform number and the line your train will depart from and you can then follow the elaborate signange to find your bearings. It is somewhat overwhelming initially but all the signs are in English and once you crack the code it quickly makes sense. The staff are all extremely friendly and while English is not widely spoken they will certainly point you in the right direction."

I think in 40 years of international travel that I've ever met a more helpful team of people. Nothing was too much trouble, and for every question I had about travel in Tokyo or Japan, they would make sure that I got the right specialist in that area to get the exact answer. Lots of free maps, guides, timetables, all available in English (I didn't enquire about other languages though).There are probably many equally helpful travel info offices all over Tokyo, but if you're stuck for one, make your way here. Many of the metro (and other) lines have linked walkways to Tokyo Stn / Marunouchi. And of course, the bullet train goes from here. Get an E5 (Hayabusa) train going north, if you want to experience the full 200mph / 320kph speeds.Plenty of eating and shopping options in and around the station, too."

Staff were preventing passengers going on to platforms, understandably, because of a) the weather and b) the dangers of overcrowding. The result however, was thousands of people crammed into the station, none of whom had any idea when they would be travelling, because all trains had been cancelled. In the end to ease the obvious dangers of so many people packed in, some were let on to platforms where at least there was fresh air. Then it was a case of sitting on the platforms as there are very, very, few seats on Shinkansen platforms. For a westerner the problems were greatly exacerbated as the station staff had virtually no English, so we had no idea of what actually was happening or from whom to get information. The signage in English was similarly limited. It's at these times one realises how great the language barrier is. The few coffee shops were packed.In the end the trains began running a limited service some 5~6 hours late, but having no announcements in English we didn't realise that the static train we had sat looking at for so long was going to be the first to run.........until Japanese passengers all made a frenzied dash into it. It was to be standing room only........"

All very businesslike and serious. An attraction in itself to take this train. About a 20 second stop time so you have to jump off."

The only negative is that you can't pass thru all the places without a ticket or charge to your suica card.

There are two systems, the JR lines which are mostly above ground, and the subways. Few maps have both systems superimposed and there are no system maps at stations, unlike other big cities. But the greatest thing ? NOBODY TALKS ON MOBILE PHONES! The Japanese consider inflicting others with your banal chat to be very inconsiderate and rude.

There are multiple levels and it is easy to get lost as most signs are not in English and I didn't find an information counter or people who spoke English. You absolutely HAVE to remember which entrance you are coming in from as there are several on the Yaesu side and several on the Marounichi side and these sides are quite far apart. I would recommend you make a mental note of what's around the entrance so you can easily find it again although signs for the various exits are clearly indicated throughout the station. I entered from the Yaesu North entrance next to the Daimaru department stores and could not find where to buy a metro ticket. On the ground level, the ticket offices are all for the JR trains, not for the metro. You have to go down one level to get a metro ticket. If you're exploring, the one-day pass at 710 Yen is a great deal. Have cash (true for almost everything except hotels).For the metro, the stops are easily found regardless of what language you're comfortable with as each metro line has a letter (M for Marunouchi, H for Hibiya, etc.) and each stop has a number. Metro maps, no matter what language, appear to show these letters and numbers. Tokyo Station is M17 for the Marunouichi line, for example. The platforms are marked by line and stop: M1-10 on one platform; M11-17 on the other side.I found the metro easy to deal with and more efficient as the maps I had weren't very helpful as they were either in Japanese, which I could not read, or in English, so the words didn't match up to the signs. Wandering around on my own, I relied on my phone's GPS to get where I wanted. At least on the metro, I knew where I would end up. Not all streets in Tokyo names, adding to the complexity of finding your way around. In other places I've been, I'd just grab a taxi if I were lost; in Tokyo, they are so expensive that I couldn't rely on being able to take them unless I were willing to spend $20+ for a 5-minute ride. There is an express train to Narita airport, but because I was staying on the Yaesu side and the train leaves from the Marunouchi side, I was told that it would be far easier for me to take the Airport Limousine Bus that departs across the street from the Yaesu Central entrance (in front of the Yanmar building). Tokyo Station requires a lot of walking and going up and down stairs. I didn't see elevators, although I imagine they must be somewhere. Dealing with luggage at that station would not be fun or easy. The advice about the bus was great -- at 3,000 yen, paid on the bus with no reservations required, it was simple and comfortable (luggage goes underneath and you get a ticket for your bag, so no worries about lugging luggage onboard or getting it back). The station is a destination in and of itself. I think the Marunouchi side is probably much nicer than the Yaesu side as the Marunouchi neighborhood is old and elegant. There are restaurants throughout the place at different price points. Unlike in the U.S. where people grab and eat on the run, in public transport, walking on the street, I did not see any Japanese eating (or carrying coffee or a soda) in the station unless they were in a restaurant -- and the same for on the street.Daimaru department store in the station is gorgeous with beautiful prepared foods on the bottom floor and more elegant packaged sweets and foods on the ground floor. Great place to get a baguette (Paul Bocuse bakery downstairs), bento boxes of sushi and noodles, yakitori, and other items. Leave your fancy shoes in the hotel if you plan to take the metro or do any walking."

            "review": "Good luck with navigation. This place is huge.. This is a beautiful station, a destination in itself, as the hoard of people taking photos outside will attest. Here are tips for those first timers just passing through.1. If you are not sure about where to go, don't be married to an idea of what to do when you get there, e.g., I'll find a tonkatsu place there and eat. The station is really big. Eat where there's food, buy where there's stuff is the better approach. Trying to find something is pretty hard, even with a map. I ended up spazzing out after a few wrong turns, and never got to eat tonkatsu. Wah.2. Meeting up with a friend at a nearby building \"adjacent\" to the station? Maps can be deceiving. I was supposed to meet up with a friend in one of those Marunochi buildings. The exit in the map on the building's website that shows where Tokyo Station is \"connected\" to Marunochi Park isn't a properly labeled door. It looks like a door that could lead to the janitor's closet. For first timers, try searching for nearby buildings at ground level outside station. Then work your way backward when you see a door or passageway that leads to Tokyo Station, for when you have to go home.3. Killing time? Plenty of shops, and there's an area that shows in photos and words (English!) the history of the station. Two Prime Ministers were killed here! Cool trivia.When I go back, I will allot some time to explore some more, because it's interesting enough."

The restored Tokyo Central Railway Station finally reopened yesterday after five years of construction to return it to the form it was when it was first built in 1914. Destroyed by fire during the war, the domes have been rebuilt and the interior is almost exactly the same as the original. Lovely. So happy that Tokyo is finally starting to take an interesting in these old buildings and finally restore them rather than tear them down. As a train station, Tokyo Station is huge and can be confusing. But follow the signs or ask questions. People are generally helpful and friendly in Tokyo. This station can be hard to navigate even for locals so people are used to answering questions. GO and see the renovations!!! Just beautiful!"

I am a 67year old female with a backpack and grey hair, which I have found helps a lot!! at the airport in Amman I was asked \u201chow old is my hair\u201d I replied the same age as my body and just laughed1I arrived in Tokyo 4/2/12 from Auckland with Air New Zealand. I had no trouble following the signs to the Japan Rail Office where I exchanged my voucher for a Rail Pass and reserved my seat for the first of 21 days rail travel. I had bought the Green ticket which gives you First class travel when ever available depending on the trains selected. I believe that it is well worth the extra, depending on your budget! Remember that the Rail Pass can only be purchased outside Japan. I then paid $17NZ for the 80minute train ride to Ueno station without having to change.The instuctions to the hostel where good as it was dark by the time I arrived and a crisp 11*.The hostel was Oak Hostel and good with a female only floor and free internetThe next day I went to Yogogi Park as I had been there, as a tourist, in 1964 Olympics and wanted to see the changes. I bought my ticket from the machine which is easy enough if you stand back and read the huge board on the wall telling you which line to get and what price etc. At the machine in English it asks you or you read 1/ How many people 2/ value of your ticket 3/insert money 4/ out comes ticket & change! Decide which platform ( & which level) your train will depart from. Go through the barrier where you insert your ticket which opens the gate and returns your ticket which you need to open the exit gate. My train was on the Yamanoto Line marked green on all maps and travel in a circle ie line 3 northwards and line 4 southwards. On the Sunday morning they were arriving every 2 mins.The passengers were all the same throughout the country that is constantly texting, even older people or they were sleeping & just seem to know when to wake up. Seldom was a conversation heard. Very few were reading and all very well dressed.After having a good walk through the park and finding the stone wall that I have taken of me all those years ago although there is a 6 lane road passing in front now instead of a wide footpath.On to another train to Tokyo central as I wanted to be sure of where I needed to gofor my trip north.This station has many levels and all have shopping 'streets', its like a city underground. I had planned to go to the Ginza as there are no cars on a Sunday but by late afternoon I made my way back to the hostel. Traveling by local trains has been no trouble as above the doors is a changing screen showing both in English & Japanese the next 3 stations also the speaker system tells you in both languages what station is coming up and what line to transfer to if ness. There is not even a piece of paper on the floors and I did not see anyone smoking anywhere on the stations and seldom a butt on the lines also.I caught the local train at 9am to be sure to arrive in Tokyo central with time to spare but forgot to allow for 'rush hour' \u2026..I know not when it finishes but it was still in force at that time!As the train arrives the team of 6 cleaners in uniforms of blue and red, bow to welcome the train, they also bow to the exiting passengers. Inside of 6minutes,they have cleaned the carriages down to wiping the handrails vac etc. During this time there is a line across the door saying\u201done moment please\u201d . When they have finished they then line up and bow to us, the ongoing passengers. We are also welcomed by the guard? And hostess in a pink and grey uniform. Each train leaves within seconds of departure time.The seats are huge like 'business class' on planes. Within 20 minutes the hostess is around with her trolley of hot and cold drinks, food and newspapers. Hot towels are always offered first. The seats are two and one. The trains do not slow down when going through non stop stations which is a bit hairy until you get used to it.Two hours north of Tokyo and the roofs are all thick with snow. No chimneys so I guess its gas/electric heating.Arriving at Shim-Aomori there is a two hour wait between trains so I went down to street level to take a photo of the snow piled up at the sides of the road higher than a Hiace van. The train came in on the upper level. The next train to Hakodate left on time and I noticed that most cars are left outside and that garages are not common. The last train for today was sitting at the opposite platform so no problem to make it although 11minutes between stop to go. Stewardess checked the tickets when you are in your seat. The ticket is printed with English to and from stations, the time of arrival and departure,name and number of train, car and seat number. The platforms are also painted with car numbers so when the train arrives it stops at exactly in front of the single file line of waiting passengers.I had booked into the Sapporo Youth Hostel which was less than10mins from the main station. Thank goodness for the escalators both up and down at all the stations, and when I arrived at ground level I found the hostel a 2min walk along the path all very well lit. It appears to be new but in fact is 10 yo. My bed is on the 3rd of 4 floors with lift. Single beds with full length curtains all round each bed and good wall reading lights. Bathroom is along the hall and spotless. The toilets are heaven! Japanese breakfast is available or BYO.Caught train out to view the ice carvings as it was festival time and they were well worth the trip north. -4 during the day and dropping to -9 night. I visited the local shops and was amazed at the speed everyone works ie from the staff filling the shop shelves to the grader driver clearing the snow from streets. The size of the carrots were the width of my hand Kumara the size of my shoe. The presentation is great. Even down to the choice of clothes for cats and dogs with 'grippy soled' socks for pets so they dont slip on the wooden floors.Sapporo to Wakkanai.The first train was from Sapporo to Asahikawa and by this day the snow was up to the above the height of the train windows in places. The temperature inside the train is kept at 25* so its a case of taking off the layers of clothes when you get on and then redressing to leave the train.There was an hours wait before the next train which was a local one with the straight hard seats and all in one carriage. I was guessing that maybe we were running late so I took my tickets up to the driver ( open plan driver!) and with a lot of pointing on my part and a lot of talking and smiling on his part I guessed all was well. When we got to the change over station he said 'run' and I did but the other driver saw me so that made me feel happier! By now we are in the real local train stops. The 'stations' look like converted shipping wagons that do the job if you need them. They have a window and door and in this weather they would be a life saver if you were caught out. The train stopped whenever, but as there were only a handful of travelers and a bunch of school kids that got on for about 20minutes and then off again in what looked like the middle of nowhere. On one section of track we had two 'drivers' with the second man standing next to the driver keeping watch. There were some tunnels,which looked like carports which covered the roof to guide and snow falls over the train and keep the track clear. Arriving at the end of the line I walked out of the station and saw the hotel I had booked into 'at 2pm' as described to me, so a 2minute walk along frozen walkways with snow piled up above head height was the start of my few days at the top of Japan.My room on the 7th floor gave me great views when the the snow eased. All the cars drive 'normally' but no speeding and careful on the corners as the snow does not give you much vision!I got the local bus 'to the end of the road'. You get on at the back door and take a ticket and pay at the front door when you get off. There is a computer at the front of the bus telling you what you owe by the number on your ticket to where you are at that time. I then came back to town and wandered around the streets as it was fascinating to me to be walking around in what looked like the Artic! But was only -11*I came across the Saturday morning s organised sport!....Paintball but using balls of ice which I think could well be more painful. I watched for a while but it proved to be too cold for my three pairs of socks so it was back to the hotel to the hotel to thaw out.There is also a massive breakwater that has been built as a half circle to deflect the storms. I found that my nose dripped and froze but if I covered it my glasses would fog up!I enjoyed walking without the wind as its tottally silent except for the crunch of you shoes. Many of the shops have Russian type writing outside which is not a surprise when they are so close."

You can find it on the basement level, and there are signs in English as well as Japanese.This is a great place to shop for gifts you might want to take home to the family. My teen and pre-teen kids loved the cool anime and Japanese t-shirts I found at Shonen Jump store, downstairs in the Tokyo Character Street shopping area.If you like ramen, \"Tokyo ramen street\" can be found at the southern end of the station on the Yaesu side - there are 8 to 10 ramen restaurants in a row. It gets very crowded at lunchtime so go early if eating lunch there. No English signage so you have to either read some Japanese as I do, or be willing to just try things. Many of the restaurants do have the famous plastic samples of dishes so that you can get a visual idea of what the choices are."

But if you ask someone he or she will surely help you. It takes some 'study' to understand the transport system in Tokyo but you can really go anywhere by train and/or subway."

            "review": "Want To Experience A Human Ant Farm? - Look No Further Than Tokyo Central!. This place is not for newbies to Japan or Tokyo. its multi leveled, like a maze and extremely busy. Makes Grand central in NYC look like a country railway station in terms of the number of people going through here.Like everything, once you know what you are doing its easy, but very hectic and busy. I would suggest getting a guide to help you the first time you go here to get your head around how everything works.They have painted lines in different colours along all of the ceilings to assist you to get to the platforms you need. The ticket system requires you to insert your ticket at different security check points along the way to gain entry. You keep getting your ticket back out the other side of the scanner until you get to your final stop then it keeps it.Try one of the Nozomi bullet trans. They are not cheap, but they are fantastic to travel in. Very clean and confortable seats and carraiges and this is a better way to travel around Japan than domestic flights. There are olenty of luggage services that will pick up your suitcase from your hotel and drive it to the next city where you are staying at and drop it right at your new hotel. This only costs about $25.00 USD for most trips and it means you can go to the station with your carry on luggage and wheel it right on. This is definately the best way to travel around Japan.The trains are super efficient and always on time. the bullet train travels at around 250KMH so it's very fast and the stations all connect the bullet trains with the slower loacl trains so it's easy to get where you want. You can of course take your suitcase with you on the train, but i don't reccommend this as the pedestrian traffic at the stations is insanely busy and you will struggle !After using Tokyo central a few times i now know how ants feel in an ant farm. - If you suffer from claustrophobia give it a big miss. Around 129 Million Japanese live in Japan which is slightly larger than New Zealand which has 4 million inhabitants. - Get the picture?"

I'm not one to easily lose my sense of direction but that happened to me, easily, in the station. And it's not just a train station, there's an entire shopping mall integrated with the station. Despite the large size of the station, I was amazed at how clean it was. No rubbish anywhere, and graffiti is something that Japanese just don't believe in. You could easily spend an entire day just walking through the station seeing things."
