Old town is a nice place to stay but normally more expensive than staying in new town or surrounding areas, The Holiday Inn at the convention center is totally reasonable and located within 5 minutes of the Subway station. A few great places to eat near the hotel if you want to get away from hotel food. The hotel has a great breakfast buffet and reasonable cost. Old town everything is very close and walking distance. The one important site to see that you would have to catch a bus or trolley #22 due to the palace is located at the top of the hill and its pretty steep. You can walk down but not advise walking up if you have a family or not in great shape for walking."

There are many excellent restaurants, great street vendor food stalls, local pubs and bars, shops, statues and people galore. The weather was perfect and we don't have one bad thing to say.

Just go down one side street and you will get better food and drinks at a much better price."

This text is written in English:It's easy getting impressed by buildings and bridges and statues and people and food and drinks while visiting the beautiful city of Prague, my my advise is never to forget looking down.I am talking about the cobblestones.Walking on the pavements in Prage is like walking on pieces of art. The pavements deserve stilettos but that's the last thing you put on your feet when walking around in the streets and the alleys and some places not found on google.On my latest trip to Prague I was talking to some of the real heroes turning the pavements into true art, - they gave me the best souvenir ever, three cobblestones reminding me to stay happy at my primary home in Norway while missing the home keeping quite a large bit of my heart."

The historic old town actually is an old town with structures that go back hundreds of years. It is easily walkable and there are a few subway stations within walking distance. Nice aerial view of the main square from atop the old townhall. Wish I could have done the townhall tour but it was shut down due to a private event. And of course there is the famous astronomical clock that gets loads of people to watch it every hour on the hour for the moving display of characters."

Munich clock is better, but it is much younger too. Nice to seat in the restaurants and watch the people, but beware that menu is twice as expensive than ones on the next street."

            "review": "Every bit as good as the publicity. I've been visiting Prague since the 1970s. There have been quite a few changes in that time, but one constant is the magic of this wonderfully preserved old city. The Old Town retains the feel of a truly old place and recent renovations have been undertaken tastefully and carefully in order to preserve this gem. There are a lot of pedestrianised streets, but traffic does still use the city, so one needs to be cautious. Stout shoes are a must to handle the cobbled streets. A bit of patience also comes in handy, as tourists flock to the city highlights, and walking tour groups abound. If you can get out and about before 10am, there are fewer people on the streets and the city is more peaceful. one caveat - Prague has become a bit of a party place for tourists, and things can get a bit exciting at night-time. Give any revellers a bit of space, and there's no trouble. The public transport (trams) run in the wider streets and are regular, clean and cheap. Don't even think about bringing a car into the centre of the old town! It's compact enough to walk, with the trams as a backup if need be. Visit. It should be on everyone's bucket list."

All the sight seeing tours start from here, and as usual atleast one walking tour is a must. Abundance of Pork and pork knuckles. Be careful of money changers and the taxi drivers at the train station. Find out the approx fare before you try and negotiate with one."

There were numerous tour groups being herded by leaders carrying umbrellas, a bunch of folks on Segways zooming around, a number of Japanese ladies getting photographed, several American tourists taking selfies, and even a Hare Rama Hare Krishna group singing and dancing along.

Sitting across from the old clock, which is the main attraction of the square will increase the cost of your drinks and food by approximately 150%.....but maybe its worth it! :). This place can get crazy and crowded with tourists at times, but provides adequate historical intrigue and interesting people watching when only moderately busy."

Prices reflect the fact that most customers are tourists. Not the place to go with a bladder problem as all the toilets are charged for even in places where you have already bought coffee and food. First time I ever saw a pay turnstile on a McDonalds toilet! I don't want to say that tourists are ripped off but you do get that feeling. Having paid to go up the town hall tower you then have to pay again to visit the cellars. Pay again to see an exhibition of Lithuanian photography and pay again to use the toilets. In the evening street vendors appear selling the most gorgeous sausages and roast pork. But again be warned. The advertised price is per 100gram not for the portion you are given. My portion weighed in at nearly 500gram and cost nearly 20 euros. I spent three days mostly in and around old town and that's more than enough to last."

Food - there are plenty of food stalls and restaurants around. Great tasting but be weary of prices. I got a sausage and bread with drink for 120czk while my friend got pork with bread for 550czk. Atmosphere - bustling with tourists and people trying to sell you things. Great for photos but if travelling with a group, expect to be approached by promoters of Segway rides, pub crawls and other little tours. We actually witnessed the pub crawl promoters fighting over business which was shocking. Tip: watch out for pick pockets, we noticed a few people standing near the food stalls watching other people's pockets and bags."

A visit to the old town square to see the astrological clock and the buildings and the church (take the time to go into this church, it is incredible) in the square, and a trip to Prague castle area (including a visit to the Cathedral, also amazing inside and out). If you get these two in, you are off to a great start. I would allow at least 3 days to really get a flavor of the city and more time if you really want to understand this cities hear. The history in this city is so deep that you need much more time to really take it all in and properly understand what the city has experienced over so many years and cycles in history. It is like visiting the history of the modern world rolled up into one city. Tip: Read about the astrological clock's history and mechanisms before you go to really appreciate it. Also read up on Prague castle and go with a tour guide or audio guide as there is little written materials to read when you are there. Also, keep a good hold of your wallet when you go to the key tourist spots as we were told pickpockets are active in this city. Tip 2: read up on taking taxis in this city to help prevent you from being ripped off by some unscrupulous taxi drivers."

The architecture and gothic towers of the astronomical clock and church in the square are a must see and why most come to Prague (well, and the Charles Bridge).I have to admit, however, that Prague was a bit of a let down relative to my expectations. Maybe it was because we were there in late August fighting the crowds during a heat wave but I found it overly touristy and crowded. This is amplified by the fact Prague isn't really that big of a city (at least the Old Town, Charles Bridge, etc. tourist areas).It would have been great to have seen Prague during or in the few years after the end of the Cold War. I heard things were more unspoiled then and even the Old Town area wasn't overrun with tourists and so many souvenir shops selling the same things.."

I have to say they have taken care of the old buildings and houses marvellously. Many of them have gone through a facade renovation while honouring the original style of the building. And it's clean! I've travelled a fair bit and nothing annoys me more than dirty cities. Prague was very clean compared to many other capital cities in Europe.Don't forget to try out the chimney cakes while in the old town. They are lovely and well worth the price."

Everything is extremely walkable, although there is quite a bit of cobblestone/uneven pavement, so proper walking shoes may be a good idea. There are a ton of great places to eat and drink. Beware (as always) of the tourist traps right in the center. Walk only 2 minutes away from the square and you will find local restaurants tucked away serving delicious food and drink at very reasonable prices. Suggestions include; Tyn Church, Town Hall Tower, Astronomical Clock and the Charles Bridge."

Pointless to go in detail about Prague - you can find more in any tourist guide or on the internet.What I can recommend is to visit it during the Winter (even better, during the Advent); with snow on the ground, long nights and possibly fog from Vltava, the authentic medieval feel of the city comes to the fore, but increased manyfold. Viewed during the night, some of the architecture starts looking as if it was straight out of the Lord of the Rings. Take a stroll through the town, eat at the food stalls and visit the local restaurants to sample the local cuisine (especially the beer - Prague is famous for its alehouses). Also, the Prague Metro is excellent: affordable, accessible and very clean."

Prague is adorned with such magnificent gothic & baroque architecture and the Old Town square is magnificent. Be prepared though, the crowds can spoil it. We are here currently in mid September, and whilst not the high season, the crowds from 10am onwards are nearly unbearable.The best advice we can give is to get out early (pre 7am) and cross the Charles Bridge and go into the Old Town Square, and you will get some wonderful photos with a minimum of tourists. You will be surprised by how many people have the same idea however if you return in a couple of hours, you will know you have made the right decision! Forego sleep, get out early - it is worth the effort :)Now a BIG WARNING! We were severely ripped off and want to let others know so that he same does not happen to you. At the back of the square (directly opposite the Tin Church - the one with two spires), alongside yet another church, you will find a series of wooden stalls selling Prague Ham off a spit, and a traditional potato dish. You will not be able to miss it...BE WARNED, do not make the same mistake we did.....We noticed a large line of people queuing for this traditional experience, so like all tourists thought 'if there are so many people it must be good'. We ordered 1 x ham, 1 x said potato dish, and 2 beers. We were then told the price was the equivalent to 36 euro / 40 USD!! What we did not realize is that they charge by the gram.What is even more interesting is that they pack as much as they possibly can in of the potato dish into a bowl, and when weighing, also add on the thick piece of bread that they include with your meal - all charged per gram! We were given quite literally closet half a pig on a plate for 2 of us - we have never seen such 'doorstops' of meat - we then discovered why, as 'doorstops' weigh a lot and therefore they can charge what they like!We told the guy taking the money that we did not have enough money on us, so he cut us down to one beer; scooped off some potato muck, and miraculous the price was 795 koruna after we told him we only had 800 koruna cash on us.We quite literally felt sick after being ripped off so badly, and did not enjoy one bit of the meal. In fact we took a couple of bites each and the rest went in the bin. We would rather have given the money to charity. Please, do not patronise these people and do not be fooled by the long lines!"

Don't be afraid to eat someplace right on the square. People say it's a 'touristy rip-off' but honestly it only costs less than $10 more for the same dinner that the 3 of us had at a 'local hotspot' down a bunch of far sidestreets and it certainly didn't offer either the amazing ambience of eating on the Square nor the views nor the service provided here."

Prague is probably one of the most beautiful cities I have ever visited, cobbled streets pastel buildings and a rich history. However, our trip has been somewhat ruined by the rip off prices and dishonest vendors in the Old Town. There seems to be an attitude that because the place is so beautiful and in such high demand that it is acceptable to be rude to customers and then charge them ridiculous prices for pretty average food. The first day we visited we wanted to have a beer in the sun so we sat at one of the pizzerias in the square, the waiter who served us was obviously already flustered because he was busy and decided he was going to rather unprofessionally take it out on us. He made it quite clear he wasn't happy that we had only ordered light food (bearing in mind that it was lunch time and 30 degree heat) and then offered to bring the bill before we had finished eating (!) needless to say we didn't tip which by the way isn't compulsory and IS included in the bill by law even if they insist it isn't. Only tip of you receive good service which unfortunately is rare in Old Town. My biggest gripe of the trip was the Old Prague Ham vendors, we went there expecting a cheap meal as it states on the menu it's 89 koruna for 100g of ham. We made the mistake of not specifying how much we wanted and they gave us 500g slab, that and some bland cabbage and bacon came to 750 koruna!! I asked him to repeat it because I couldn't believe it. These idiots are the biggest scammers and pray on tourists and I found this incident particularly upsetting-we went to the vendor on the far left; avoid that particular one at all costs. The only half decent experience we had was at Kotleta; a grill bar in the Old Town square. The waiter was really polite and attentive and the food was decent, however, the waiter then ruined the experience a bit at the end by asking for a tip. Which I thought was cheeky, we were planning on leaving money on the table so were put in a bit of an awkward position and as a result gave him less than I had intended. All in all, visit the Old Town, it is beautiful but do not eat at the Old Prague Ham vendors in the square, have a beer there and admire the views but if you can find a quieter side alley restaurant, we will be doing that instead next time, lesson learnt."

The atmosphere, the people, stores and buildings are unbelievable. I do not know anyone on the street, but I have a filling I belong there. Everything is so close to you so friendly, that creates a filling, this is your neighborhood .But there is a warning if you need money exchange. Never exchange on a main road. Shop around, go to side streets or a bank. The exchange rate is very similar almost everywhere. Where they will get you is a commision. I had seen 19.9% commision what I thought it is worse than anything else. Until I had see a small store close to main square- Vaclav's square with commission of 29%. Some one would expect there are not people exchanging money there. Wrong it was a line, because it was so convenient.Otherwise if you want to have a cup of coffee or glass of beer, go 30 yards further from a main street and you will save 30% or more.Happy trip."

Observe the fine details in the facade of buildings, and when you feet are weary, enjoy a cold drink in one of the cosy bars and cafes, while watching people pass by. Choose however, the smaller establishments and far from the tourist attractions as drinks and food there tend to be more expensive. If you need a few presents to be bring home, try the smaller souvenir shops in one of the smaller streets, as prices here are also cheaper than near the main tourist attractions."

The architect is amazing on the old buildings. The restaurants and shops are jammed into every nook and cranny so if that is your thing, you will be thrilled! Speaking of restaurants, food is expensive there compared to most of Czech so be prepared. English is spoken almost everywhere and charge cards are also accepted almost everywhere. While I had heard rumors of pickpockets and danger, I never saw it or felt it. Be prepared to walk. Every street offers something to see. I brought my own water and snacks in a back pack to save money. There is no subway directly into Old Town but it is within several blocks. Trams also offer transportation. You can see most if it in several hours but to really enjoy the experience allow more time, or go for short periods of time over several days and nights."

Old Town Prague has some of the finest examples of architecture in the world with gems from the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque era. Buildings remain intact because the city was not rebuilt like most European capital cities during the 18th or 19th centuries and wasn't bombed during World War II.The town square is almost always buzzing with activities. Street performers abound and there are many restaurants and cafes to sit and people watch while sipping a pilsner or coffee. Be aware that cafes right on the town square tend to charge more and the quality of the food can be questionable. However, given the atmosphere, spending a few extra crowns is definitely worth it.The astronomical clock is always a big draw. From 9 in the morning until midnight, large crowds gather in front of the clock on the hour to see it in action. It's really a mechanical marvel as it was first installed in 1410. It is the third oldest astronomical clock and is the oldest one in the world still functioning. Go up into the clock tower for a picturesque view of the city. Also not to be missed are the Tyn and St.Nicholas Churches, right on the square."

It's obviously one of the best attractions of Prague so I don't blame everyone for wanting to see it. I would say it's worth visiting at least once when you are in Prague. I suggest paying rent (a beer, cup of coffee or other drink of choice) at one of the overpriced cafes in the square and just relax and watch people go by. It's not going to be cheap but it's definitely worth it for a short time. There's also a lot of food stalls with different traditional Czech snacks worth checking out."

So we booked a long weekend in Prague after having done Rome, Paris, Barcelona etc and wanting to experience something a bit different. Having not had a lot of friends visit Prague with their significant other it was a little hard to convince mine to begin with that visiting was a good idea but none the less after some research we booked and were on our way. Then came a whole different set of thoughts neither of us had ever learnt a word of Czech and we were sure of the currency etc but....then we arrived.Prague is beautiful, in so many ways it really is almost hard to describe. The Old Town is the most charming and captivating area within a capital city I have visited, almost like something out of a fairy tail with its old architecture so fantastically preserved. Walking through the old cobbled streets (not for the high heels ladies) really sets the scene for the glorious backdrop of buildings awaiting around each corner. It is very easy to walk a fair distance without realising when in the Old Town so be sure to have a map and be keeping an eye on where you are walking as it is easy to get a little disorientated.Stare Mesto is host to some fantastic restaurants and bars so be sure to check them out for some traditional Czech cuisine. I've seen a few people writing saying not to buy food and drink in the area but it is most definitely safe to do so just don't fall prey to the tourist traps. However I must say getting a pint of Staropramen in the Old Town Square in the evening isn't a bad idea! The area doesn't live up to the typical expectancy of it being full of stag do's like everyone may think. Ironically we saw 3 groups whilst out there to celebrate in this sort of way and most of them were from the Czech republic!All in all if you are thinking about going just do it, you won't regret it! Make it more magical and visit at night when its all lit up as well!"

We loved all areas and would like to return one day to see it all again. We found everything was close by and easy walking distance. We visited in late July. The weather and temperatures were just right and although everywhere was busy with many tourists like us, this added to the atmosphere and an enjoyable stay."

The old town is quieter than you would expect as The Charles Bridge is rammed with tourists. There is a lovely park and some pretty shops. You can get a boat trip from here too. Stare Mesto is the quieter more reflective side of Prague and definitely worth a visit. You don't have to walk over The bustling Charles Bridge any of the bridges will take you there, it depends on how much walking you like!"

The old town square is great during the day with jugglers,living statues and fellows making giant soap bubbles for kids, but to my mind it really comes alive at night. Lots of people just hanging out or eating at one of the food stalls or restaurants that ring the square. At the top of the hour the astronomical clock is the place to be. There are all types of buildins around the square from medieval to gothic. Fantastic place."

It sis very easy to explore on your own with a map since public transport (metro, tram buses ) is very well designed. The street are filled with statues, musicians."

It is a little sad to see the poverty and the buildings that need better upkeep. But, it is also charming to see things maintained as they were and not replaced by chain restaurants or modern building. There is something to be said for preserving the classic architecture."

While there visit the Tyn Church, go up the Town Hall tower for some of the best views, stop by St. Nicholas church and check out Orloj. Jan Hus monument in the center of the square. The horse drawn carriages, just like the ones in Vienna and New York complete the picture and add the old world ambience. The Old Town in Prague is as crowded now as the centers of Florence, Venice, Vienna or Paris, where we visited recently. It was not always like that. But as they say - it is what it is.

Many of the \"Must-See\" sites of the city are located there, within a short walk from each other, there are a lot of restaurants and food places, souvenir shops and bars.Being the most popular touristic area also means that it is mostly overcrowded with tourists (almost no locals), so it is advised to visit it in the morning.

It is prettier than the Little Square in Malmo (and better than Copenhagen) with magnificent churches surrounding the square. The view for photographs does clear in between the chimes so stick around for your opportunity. The area is a bottle-neck to the narrow alleyways of boutique shops leading to Charles Bridge, so be prepared to jostle for position.The area also has a few beggers, annoying buskers who cannot sing, and some crazy human statues (eg. Michael Jackson). I think they detract from the historical significance of the site but I guess they are just trying to eke out an existence. The Old Town has a pretty exciting vibe in spite of the latter, and is a bit of a light show at night. Worth a visit if in Prague.Tick the thumbs up if my review helps."

A most impressive looking building. I don't know if you can go in it, we didn't.You can book ghost tours to go under the Astronomical Clock too, it's a fun tour but great to actually be able to go under it.Come back at night too, it's still full of activity and looks even better!

The Mala Strana Bridge Tower is the smaller of the two; the entrance to the Old Town is through the State Mesto Bridge Tower, which used to be part of the old town's fortifications. As soon as you walk through, you are in the Old Town and you will continue walking down the royal way; you will see crowns in the walls of the streets so you know that it is Charles IV's famous road. The Old Town is beautiful, and the culmination is the famous square with the Astronomical Clock. You might want to see St. Nicholas Church, which is really beautiful, and Kinsky Palace. Also there is a house called the Storch House that has a painting of St. Wenceslas on horseback, so it's pretty hard to miss. The Old Town is also filled with houses with various carvings over the doors that used to identify them before the houses were numbered; one of the most famous is the House at the Two Golden Bears.Also, the Estates Theatre is there; this is where Mozart premiered his opera don Giovanni in 1787, and it was used for the movie Amadeus. They were performing Don Giovanni when we were there! It's just chock full of so many things to see, that you really need to make a list of what you want to look at and hunt it down, because Prague, especially in August, is very popular with tourists. This is my favorite part of the city."

Beware though, there was a 30 minute before the stairs for the hall which are indoors, and we didn't know it was there when we bought the tickets. Don't expect much from chiming of the astronomical clock, it's very overpacked on the hour, and although the clock itself is amazing, the little figurines going round is a bit underwhelming."

Food is overpriced and as we weren't big fans of Czech cuisine, we tried the only Mexican Restaurant there, which was also disappointing. So go there to be surrounded 360 degrees by amazing architecture and probably eat elsewhere. We heard the view from the tower is amazing but the queue was too long so we had to skip it.

The quality of the music - jazz yesterday - was great. We also spent about an hour in the Alfons Mucha exhibition at the Trcek House in old town.

The tour guides and locals have this wonderful welcoming quality, and they love to share their history. If you ask them genuine questions and are interested in learning about the city, the opportunities are endless.The tours are a must, to get the low-down on everything, but if you're short on time - just go to the Old Town. Soak up the hustle and bustle. Let your eyes feast on the beautiful architecture. Have a local beer and find a place to just experience everything around you. I loved every second that I was here, and I think that would be the case night or day, rain or shine. Go for a weekend away, or indulge in a longer stay. Just make sure that you go, because it's really the kind of place that you don't want to miss."

Well, I have to say: Prague is an amazing city, full of cultural events, has lots of history, has some sort of life of its own that makes you want to stay a bit longer and enjoy it more.It is at its Old town square that one must go and stay and enjoy. Don't go and stare for a couple of minutes! No! If you go to Prague, take a little of your time to sit and walk around, enjoy the animation (music, acrobatic performances), the sounds, the buildings around you.. everything. And don't forget: the astronomical clock! Yes, every hour it displays some figures \"dancing\".. but don't get so excited, for the show only lasts about a minute. After that, stop recording, since you will only keep recording the stroke of the clock, nothing new will happen.However I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and that you get to stop for a few moments to enjoy your time there. Ah, don't forget to go up the tower! The view is very nice as well!"

It's easy to find using a map and once you're there, there's plenty to see. The buildings are beautiful and easy to see, although there are large groups of tourists which we had to wade through to get anywhere. People say to spend a day just looking around here, but after a couple of hours there's not much to see or do. I'd definitely recommend going up the astronomical clock tower, as you get views across the city which are breathtaking. It's fairly cheap too so it's well worth the money."

The general exchange rate when I went was \u00a31 = 31/32 koruna's. When I went to exchange at this place, the guy didn't give me the correct info, pretending he didnt speak englist very well and I signed all the documents to say I wanted to exchange - I lost out about \u00a340 worth of money wish he refused to refund!

Depending on the day there are people playing the instruments, people dressed up as golden statues (you need to pay then to take pictures with them) and restaurants all around. This isn't a place you need to plan unless you have a certain place you want to visit whithin the Old Town Square since you will most proapably pass by it to get to different places in Prague.

You can take photos of the clock tower and churches without waiting for people to move as it's above everyone's head. Early morning or evening are great times to visit."

The Dali exhibition was good but left us both a little disappointed - wish we had gone to see the Mucha exhibition too.

It really doesn't matter which you choose as long as you're looking into the square. It felt very safe and the people are wonderful. Don't be surprised to find yourself incorporated into a neighbouring conversation (mind you, they're often tourists of course) and you'll find the level of service invariably very high. In the summer, with the sun not setting until around 10pm, the increasingly golden glow of the sun on the ancient buildings adds to the wondrous feeling of being a part of history."

Castles, churches and abbeys showcase the distinct character and ambiance that take you back to better and safer times. There is an abundance of restaurants to choose from - try the local Czech food which is very tasty and portion sizes are always large! Shops galore to browse or buy from - even the department stores blend in well. Getting around is easy by foot or on the trams. Take a ride up to Prague Castle for a wonderful look over the city and enjoy the gardens and buildings. Old Town has a unique feel and more restaurants and a large outdoor market with wares of all sorts. The astronomical clock is a favorite when the bell tolls on the hour. Prague should be on the top of your list if you want see \"old\" Europe."

We paid 800CHZ for two people and one of us ended up sick for 2 days from the food. I recommend you take pictures of the spit roast but skip the eating part until another venue with better value and hygiene. There's lots of street performers here so take lots of coins, most of them are rather entertaining.

You will find a lot of segway tour companies soliciting your business, but don't fret, and I highly recommend chatting them up. It was a great way to see the city and visit some really cool spots in a unique way. I highly suggest Cool Segway Tours as they were awesome setting up our private tour and you can't beat the value. But again the square and entire Old Town area is a happening place with plenty of shops, restaurants and cafes to enjoy and take in all scenery has to offer.

The market tower, astronomical clock, Jan Hus statue, beautiful buildings and churches that outline the square and general feeling of being in a fairy tale make it amazing. The only thing that bothered me was the incessant annoying Segway renters. We just told them we had already done it and they began to leave us alone. This really needs to be stopped and I saw them speeding around, in and out of people walking. "

It was my 3rd time in Prague this Summer and while it is still one of my favorite cities I can see why going in October might be much better than during July. As I am a tourist myself I cannot complain about the crowd, still it is sometimes difficult to navigate trough the Old Town (especially with strollers) during the day (except early morning and very late evening). Aim to see the square before the party people start getting out early evening, it'll be a much better experience. Prague will put its magic spell on you too for sure, it is a city not to be missed!"

I) Watch your pockets and your gadgets!! Being so crowded it is very easy to be stolen. II) We were a bit surprised, but not in the good way, about the many people who are presummably trying to sell us tockets to concerts. In Prague you will see many like that going on the streets, trying to persuade you to buy such tickets. We personally found it expensive and there was a guy very insistatnt, fact hich we did not like. When we said \"it is expensive\", he said he could make a discount. So we immediately realized it was something wrong about it. Please, be aware of these guys as you will see them around in the whole Old Town."

The view was very pretty at night with the city lights and we could see the castle a night which was floodlit. The city was very crowded and getting around was difficult at times but we were able to see and visit the places we intended to. The changing if the guard at the castle gates was good to see despite the huge crowd and a thunderstorm that preceded it. The walk through the old town and Jewish area was interesting as too was the walk over the Charles Bridge and the streets up to the castle. It was our second visit to Prague after a gap of about 8 years. It was still as interesting and quite a lovely place to see despite the crowds. There are plenty of good eating places there also."

Thursday was a better time as it wasn't as crowded as Friday. We were on a city tour on Thursday and all the historical buildings were pointed out. Many to choose from to take a deeper look. Also Old Town provides one the opportunity to window shop crystal, garnets, marionettes. Or taste Czech specialities or their round pastries with fillings like whipped cream or chocolate. If you need a restroom, their is a Starbucks across from the Astronomical Clock and it's free.Speaking of the clock don't miss the \"Walk of the Apostles\" every hour on the hour. But be careful, we were warned this is a place for pickpockets while everyone is looking up.Old Town also has concert halls and even an Apple museum. Lots to do"

There were horse carriages, food stalls, souvenir stalls, hot wine stalls, etc. This is also the place from where most guided tours start. There are also free walking tours from here. The only con of this area is the massive crowds at any time of the day, along with the guided tours vendors on their segways in front of the Astronomical Clock.Must do: Do visit the viewing deck at the top of the Astronomical Clock tower for amazing views of Old Town and Mala Strana. Do wait for the hourly clock ceremony at the Astronomical Clock. Do drink the hot wine and eat the freshly made potato chips, fried break or potato pancakes, if you happen to be there during the Easter markets."

There are so many tourists during summer it it became a little crowded but it was still ok. As the Segway tours come towards you just say no thanks and most go away. If you want a good Segway tour go over the bridge to the lesser town and do a trip there fewer people more space and a better experience"

The Tower behind the Astronomical Clock is definitely worth a visit. There is a tour which takes you into the tower, from where one can see the inner workings of the Astronomical Clock. The best views of Prague can be found from within the Tower."

Walking around the many winding streets in and around the Old Town you will encounter English,Irish,Mexican,American,German in fact every type of pubs,bars and restaurants and all cuisine types,it is that good.This is Pragues most photographed area and is also the most popular and with the big tourist crowds come the usual criminal element such as pickpockets,fraudsters and the like so take sensible precautions but that said Prague is a really safe city and crime is at a minimum.

(Though watch out for being charged the wrong amount in shops/restaurants or being short-changed--we did experience that. And apparently the taxis can be crooked at times too.) You can drink the tap water, but the beer in restaurants is even cheaper than bottled water, so that was our drink of choice. It feels lively, with plenty of people around--mostly tourists probably, but still it's fun. You hear many different languages in the streets. Be sure to have a map, because it's easy to get lost in the old part of the city. But on the other hand, don't be afraid to venture off the main streets, because there are lots of little shops and restaurants hidden away."

The buildings that surround this square are 600-700 years old and are dominated by the Old Town Hall Tower (great view over the city), the Astronomical Clock (a major tourist photo opportunity), Church of Our Lady Before Tyn and St Nicholas Church. There are also large numbers of restaurants and shops that encircle the square. While we were there, Prague was having a music festival so we were also able to view and listen to the folk music and dancing from our room at the Grand Hotel Praha which was directly across from the Astronomical Clock and with a clear view of the stage and parade area. The parade consisted of over a hundred costumed musicians and dancers from all over the Czech Republic, surrounding countries, Mexico (a mariachi band) and even a large contingent representing Vietnam. This square is also where you can get a \"free\" 3 hour walking tour of the city (you pay what you feel the tour was worth). I highly recommend that when visiting Prague, you stay in or around the Old Town Square. The rest of Old Town is equally fantastic as you can go down almost any side street and find restaurants, shops and historic architecture. Visit the many small markets and outstanding churches. Allow yourself plenty of time to just relax and take it all in. We were in Prague for 4 days and could easily spent another day or two exploring."

They really help you to find your bearings.Be noted that along the old and new city centres the stores and restaurants are about 4 times more expensive than other places. So try walking a few blocks from the square to eat.Also, be very careful of pickpockets!! They are good at what they do!"

The thin line needs to go into the machine, if an inspector checks and its not validated correctly, there us a 800 cks immediate fine or 1500 if you cannot pay at the time.

The architecture, the buildings, the rooftops, the lovely streets, the river, the amazing bridges, the restaurants, the cafes, the shops of all kinds and descriptions, are all simply brilliant. One example in the Old Town square is the Old Clock which is hard to describe, but it is made of two different types of 'clock', and you simply have to see it to truly appreciate it. Thousands of visitors just stop and prepare to watch as the time arrives for the special clock presentation every hour on the hour. Oh, we cannot wait to revisit this city in the near future."

While you are there swing by and see the clock but I wouldn't recommend waiting around for it to ring because the 30 second show isn't really worth the wait. There are also a lot of tours guides in the square if you want to book something. As an aside if you are looking to book a tour Sandeman's is a great company, you can find them with red umbrellas by the Cartier shop. We went to Kutna Hora with them and would highly recommend them."

Architecturally magnificent buildings surround Old Town Square, and all of the Old Town area had the streets converted to pedestrian malls and paved with stone, giving a medieval feel, especially when viewing the twin-spire Gothic towers at the edge of Old Town Square. Prague has an excellent subway system, but in Old Town there is limited access to Metro. Prague is designed for walking, and what better way to experience the spectacular architecture? Throughout Old Town you\u2019ll come across old buildings, some dating to Medieval Times: Charles Bridge and its two tower gates, Powder Tower that has an arch over the pedestrian street, and was one of the original 13 gates/towers leading to Old Town, and many other buildings. Sidewalk caf\u00e9s line the cobblestone streets, and pubs sell draft beer for about $2. I recommend an early day visit, as tour groups, tourists, and locals gather in Old Town Square later in the day making for overcrowded conditions\u2014and an easy target for pickpockets.

There are often buskers and street entertainers which can entertain you while you marvel at the historic architecture. Off the side streets are more restaurants pubs shops and cafes and although it sometimes gets busy you never feel intimidated. There is plenty to see and do and any trip to Prague would be incomplete without visiting the square. There is the odd bit of graffiti which is a shame but the locals are surprisingly house-proud and do not drop litter (except cigarettes). Subsequently the streets are very clean and tidy. You often see the Czech people picking up the rare piece of litter and putting it in the bin. Now that's a part of their culture I wish we had in Britain!"

The anticipated pleasure of being able to wander around the old town taking in the sights was spoiled by the thousands of people all crammed into a small town. If that was not enough it was quite dangerous to look up at the exquisite architecture, because then you wouldn't see the dozens of segways ready to trip you up. They are a menace and should be banned. Walking along the river was pleasant. I deliberately went mid-week so as to avoid the even more intense crowds that arrive for a weekend visit.

The sound of musicians playing in the background would be interrupted with tour operators trying to sell their segway tours.Its adorned with restaurants and bars. The architecture , colors give an overall uplifting look to the square. The small bylanes surrounding the square are also a treat to the eye. But beware of crowds every hour near the clock. It would get insanely crowded when the procession of apostles would start in the medieval astronomical clock."

Little alley ways dart off here and there to unearth another set of restaurants and more and it really is a gluttons paradise if that is your want. For those who wish to see the area in style you can hire antique style sports cars or even go by horse and cart. This will help you take in all the historical places in around this area and there really is a lot of history to take in.You could easily spend up to a day here and is really worth a visit."

It is laced with beautiful buildings and scenic alleys. Be careful though, not all you see is historic and original, Czechs notoriously add buildings, statues etc. that look like they were built two, three hundred years ago, even in the middle ages, but are in fact 20th or 21st century products. At the end of the day its a beautiful city and a must see for any world traveler"

It was an important city to the Habsburg Monarchy and its Austro-Hungarian Empire and after World War I became the capital of Czechoslovakia. This of course all shows through the splendour of its Churches, squares and public buildings, not to mention the many smart town houses and residences.The place has a real Gothic atmosphere and a true old world European feel.In recent years it has become more expensive, so choose wisely and make sure that you are are upfront of what you are paying for,As with most places, a good local guide is well worth the investment."

It was so beautiful with all the old and colorful buildings, restaurants, shops, cobblestones, narrow streets, and people. It is always packed here, but with good reason. When you are here you remember why you wanted to visit Prague in the first place. Old Town is at the end of Charles Bridge, close to the Jewish quarter and New Town. Just keep walking and take it all in!"

Venturing around Old Town is a treat, but should be done with a map, and with careful attention to the different sized cobblestones beneath your feet. This is not an area for walking in spike heels! However with a good pair of walking shoes it is not to be missed! The streets are winding, and the street signs are on the buildings at the corners. However, not all corners have them, so carry a good map! The buildings are old and vary in structure, so that the skyline is beautiful. There are lots of shops to poke your head into, and street performers all over."

Bright colors and the floors that are built with bricks were definitely made me feel like I am in different world. Then you can start smell delicious foods from almost everywhere! You can go any direction and still find foods and beers that will definitely satisfy your journey to this beautiful city."

Our guide, Eva Kubatova, was very knowlegeable, friendly and customized our 4 hour tour to what we most wanted to see. We felt she really maximized our tour. She showed us the highlights of old Prague, gave us a fascinating insight into the history of the city and recommended specific places we could consider further exploring afterwards. In fact, we followed up on her suggestions and by the time we left Prague we felt we had experienced the wonder of Prague. As beautiful as the old city is, it was so much more interesting having some background and having our guide explain just what we were looking at! Great tour, wonderful guide!"

Their are food stalls with delicious local foods(sausages, haluschki, hams) and their are also cafes, lounges,and shops all around the immediate area. The scenery and feel in and around Old Town was wonderful, and we placed it right behind Rome out of all of the places we've visited throughout the world. Its definitely worth a visit if in Prague in our humble traveler opinions."

If you are really interested in learning facts, tales, and legends, I totally recommend the services of Radka Vocetkova. She is knowledgeble, excited about her work, willing to share all she knows, and most of all a very pleasant person to be. My husband and I had a very enjoyable time strolling the streets of Prague and attractions with her. She gave us tons of super useful tips. It was a really wonderful experience,"

Go visit anyway--it's worth it! Beautiful churches and buildings are around every corner. Besides the obvious visit to the astronomical clock, we tried to peek into side streets and smaller squares and corners. We discovered a magical puppet shop and brought home some great gifts. I can also recommend getting some tickets for a classical concert from the Via Musica office by the Tyn church."

Early morning is the best time to visit the square. I went there around 4:30 early morning to take photographs and still could see lot of people/groups hanging around..some returning after partying. Having said that, it is a must visit place if you are in Prague, very electrifying atmosphere in the evening and very calm and relaxing in the early morning."

The striking of the Town Clock is well worth waiting for,with its figure of death nodding as time towards the end passes, and the other figures shaking their heads in disagreement and the upper windows open to show the saints in the tower. Our guide like every other city dweller we met rejoiced in the freedom from communism and expressed .such national pride.Take the time to find the plaques to Kepler, Einstein, Smetana... Look up to see the baroque facades of buildings. Look down to see the brass tiles that record the homes of Jews who were taken to the concentration camps.And stop for a beer and wonderful apple pie in one of the many restaurants. Hire your own guide (like everything in Praque it won't cost you too much) for a personal exploration of the Jewish Quarter with it museum Synagogues and the still in use one - but remember Shabbat starts at sunset on Friday and Passover and the High Holidays are times you can't see as much."

Some popular places can be really overcrowded but it is still possible to find a place to sit down to drink a beer or coffee.

Our hotel said that direct flights from China and the higher earnings have generated larger numbers of Chinese tourists. The square is vibrant and lively, probably to the liking of the younger crowd. An over-abundance of segways and tour venders makes it less appealing. But if you can look past the selfie sticks, the venders, and the bubble people, it's a beautiful place."

Many great restaurants are available with out door seating. If you want something cheaper to eat or drink just check out some of the side streets. Hurry while the beer is less than $1.50 for a half liter."

I want to say 'Thank God' we did not rent a car while in Prague. We did not pay very much for a cab and it was a 30 min drive. Weigh the expense of a car, parking and yes put a huge price tag on stress of driving in the city and finding parking never mind your hotel. If you pay ahead for the cab, it's a bit cheaper. Since the exchange rate has been very good USD-EUR we stayed in the best locations we could find and stayed in 4-5 star hotels. 5 is too ornate for me so I went with the 4 stars more often than not. Since we flew into Prague, we stayed in Old Town for a few days at the front of the trip and a few on the tail end of the trip. There is plenty to see and do and an Information center right there to help. Prague is a gem worth visiting."

We never saw so many Segways in one city before. There are tourist cafes on two sides of the square and along the side with the horse carriages and the churches are several food stalls that are well worth a visit. They are roasting the meat on spits throughout the day. For a reasonable amount of money you can eat very well, very heartily. Behind the stalls on the square is a walkway lined with more stalls, some selling souvenirs and crafts and some selling food or hot wine. One stall sells potato chips on a stick that are wonderful. They aren't like anything sold in bag. They are hot and just out of the cooker. Try them. You'll probably do what we did, shared the first stick in case we didn't like them, then went back and all got our own sticks. Yummy."

We were in Prague last week.We had really bad experience with Western Union (Money Exchange) They charge 28% as the Commission and making people fool.We changed Euro with them without any question as they display better rates on board (display) and when you take money they deduct 28% commission without any knowledge.When we shouted and raised the issue they said to remove the commission, but that's not the way to work.So be very careful in exchanging money with WESTERN UNION."

Because we were always getting lost, we became very familiar with the square (all roads seem to lead back to it!).

The Old Town is extremely beautiful so you have to give yourself time to get lost in its small streets at least once during your trip. I went there in April and it was amazing. The sun was shining every single day and the tour guide told me that this is the time to visit because in summer it is so packed with tourist you won't even be able to stand on the main square. The reason i suggest you go there after easter is that Prague is an easter town and many visit during this period HOWEVER, if you go there the week after, the cute little easter shops on the square are still there, but with a lot less people!

There is a peacefulness to Old Town that seems to largely stem from the fact that there do not appear to be any annoying scooters or motorcycles zooming around.I guess Prague is a lousy city for bikers, because the streetcar (tramway) rails provide a dangerous obstacle to 2 wheel vehicles. the advantage is no mad put-put or zoom zoom sounds to annoy and spoil the mood.Crowds can be a problem during certain times of the year, so pick off peak seasons to enjoy this location."

Prices 195 chicken soup, 90 for small beer, more expensive here but great place to suck in atmosphere. If you go to exchange money please be aware to check they are giving right rate and notes. Also if you use metro tickets have to be validated beforehand and beware bogus train inspectors which spoiled our lovely stay. We're quite frightening in their approach and attitude. Wanted us to pay 800 each fine but when we refused to pay and asked for them to phone police just left us standing on the platform like lemons! Lovely city to visit though and most attractions in walking distance to each other."

There are a couple of companies that run free guided tours. They are really good because they do a good job in these tourse for getting your attention into their paid tours. So, you will get many great information about prague in general. So, you can find these free tours easily by googling them. I did with a company that i forgot the name now. But they held orange umberellas in old town squar or in front of Rudolfinum. They are quite good. Ohh! Be careful so much about pickpockets. they know their job very well.

It's not actually annoying touristy as soon as you break away from the square (which, for Europe, isn't nearly as touristy anyway). The Jewish cemetery in the Old Town is a gem, as are the various churches spread around the city (interesting fact - the majority of Czechs consider themselves non-religious, but the churches are a beautiful reminder of when this wasn't the case). We never had a bad (or overly expensive) meal in the Old Town, which our hotel had warned us would be more expensive than the rest of the city, but honestly was shockingly reasonable. It's one of those places were it's just fun to walk around in circles on a sunny day enjoying the buildings all day and stopping for coffee when you need a pick me up.

So my advice is - don't bother with a map, just go there; wander about and if something takes your eye go and see it; don't make a plan, just go with the flow; take your time and look up frequently; enjoy the little shops and the narrow streets.If you have any preconceptions about Prague these will be met by a slow wander around the Old Town.

For short and quick visit, buy things - crystals are native produces there - if that's too expensive even a t-shirt is worth a purchase - don't forget to pay a visit to Kafka's birth place / now called Kafka square.

Walk through the stalls, get a beer, walk some more, eat a cinnamon baked circle thing that is a national staple and enjoy the fantastic locale."

I did see a beer for 28CZK, which is nearly \u00a30.80 for a half litre so that was a VERY nice surprise, as were the food prices. Loved every second of it. 10/10 want to go again"

This amazingly well preserved example of old architecture is worth the visit for this reason alone. However there is a lot to see and do in the old town. The astronomical clock draws a huge crowd so get there early to get a good spot. In found the Czech people very accommodating at the restaurants and pubs and its easy to get by whne speaking only English. Most will understand what you want. Outside of prague less english is spoken but usually not that much of a problem. As with most 'touristy\" areas there are scams all around and the big one is changing money. Only change money at a bank is the rule. All in all I like Prague a lot and will go back hopefully soon. P.S. in a restaurant if you order a pizza it means you have ordered a whole pizza so be hu\\hungry if you do."

While we were in this area of Prague we saw the Astronomical Clock, went to see a play called Aspects of Alice at the Blacklight Theatre, went to Charles Bridge and went to the Jewish section as well. We also spent some time at a lovely little restaurant there a couple of days. It was reasonably priced, the staff were friendly, it was in a prime location and they had warm blankets for those who wanted to brave the outside. The Astronomical Clock was amazing! Every hour you find a crowd outside it waiting for it to chime. The story behind it and the architecture of it are amazing. Time it right so that you can see the clock chiming on the hour!The Blacklight Theatre was amazing and reasonably priced. The play was a silent play and was very enjoyable. There were good actors and actresses and they included every emotion possible in it. I would thoroughly recommend it to you (if you can find it....)Charles Bridge was breath-taking. It had good views over the river and had numerous statues over it. Each entrance to it was rather grand as well.The Jewish section could have been a day out within itself. We bought tickets to all the museums there - the best exhibition for me being about the Second World War era. There was lots of information and some of the exhibits were extremely emotional. Definitely worth a visit!Overall I would say you cannot visit the city without seeing this area of it!"

Narrow streets, twisting and turning in unexpected directions... interesting olld buildings...shops selling crystal, gems, chocolate, spa products, souvenirs (a.k.a tourist junk), original products... cafes, restaurants, bars, sausage stands and \"trdlniks\"... street performers and \"living statues\"... concerts, dark light theaters and Thai massage cabinets... little museums - Chocolate museum, Wax Figures, Sex Machines museum... everything is there, and most of it unreasonably expensive. It's a great place for a wander, but f you want to eat/ have coffee/ buy souvenirs - better do it elsewhere (a few hundred meters away are often enough), unless you have a specific place/ product in mind. Also, there's a cute little marketplace on the corner of Melantrichova and Havelska - worth a visit."

The restaurants on the square can be expensive compared to the back street pubs but you pay for the view I guess. A must see in Prague."

The famous clock of course needs to be seen, and you can climb to the top of the tower for views all around.

This was the best Xmas market experience we had during our recent Europe tours - great things to buy, some homemade plus delightful food stalls with very cheap food.

On Thursday it was getting livelier but Friday night it was the \"stag night\" city. The whole of the Old Town seemed full of groups of English men which gave the place a totally different vibe. My recommendation to anyone going to Prague, who does not just want to drink at extremely low prices, is to go nduring the week and avoid the weekend."

One good thing the old town planners in Prague did achieve was to centrally locate all the major tourist attractions in one single place which they called the \"Old Town\" (or Stare Miasto which basically means the same thing in several cities of Czech Republic and Poland). The major attractions accessible from this area include Charles University (a very reputed college in central Europe), old Jewish synagogue and cemetry on a hill, a Franz Kafka statue, the Town hall and clock tower and the best place to approach Prague Castle. Best time to visit this place is probably during winter when there is snowfall, as I have been told many times."

It used to be a huge marketplace during the twelfth century, when it was called Big Square. Later, it changed many names and forms until 1338, when a Town Hall was built here. This square has witnessed several historical events of Czech history. Jan Zelivisky, the leader of the Hussites, was burnt at the stake here. In 1915, precisely 500 years later, his statue was unveiled in the middle of the square. Another event's marks can also be seen in the form of 27 white crosses on the pavings on the floor before the town hall. 27 Czech gallants were slain here, in the 17th century, when they rebelled against the Habsbourgs. During the twentieth century this square saw the universal suffrage movement, the demonstration of independence, WWII Nazi raids, occupations, destructions and eventually communist party takeover. This square features a myriad buildings like beautiful churches, the Prague Orloj or the astronomical clock and a palace. Medieval themed Christmas and Easter markets are set up here each year."

We did not have a walking tour, as it easy to walk around and nice to go at your own pace. We went up the clock tower for 120 crowns and was definitely worth it. The views were amazing as was seeing the town stop when hearing the clock bells. Recommend this area and clock tower highly, just be careful with children whilst visiting the clock tower due to the viewing deck being very narrow and the stairs up are very steep. Wouldn't really recommend at all for young children. Additionally, we found the staff in the restaurants in the old town square very unwelcoming! A bit of a shame, but still a beautiful area overall."

Prague is a city you will fall in love with ...so please keep an extra day just in case you want to laze around in old town square sipping local brew and watching the crowd. The town centre is beautiful and there is lovely church to see and view from the astronomical clock tower is amazing. Go to Charles gate which is mesmerising and then once on the other side take tram 22 to the castle district . Tickets can be bought at any mini mart and short trip is enough as you take the tram to go up the castle area. Once you finished walking down hill is easy and you can cross over the bridge again to old town. TheJewish quarters has a very old synagogue and one can do window shopping in the high end shops . The garnets in Czech are beautiful and every lady should buy something and they not too expensive also the bohemenian crystal. Overall I found food and drinks in Praha avg around 30 to 40 euros for two people at reasonable restaurant and it is quiet cheap compared to other European cities and very good quality. Best way to see Prague is walking and once can leisurely see it in tow days at your own pace and there is no need for tour bus etc. Please visit the Czech underground rest in municipal hall and the beer factory nearby for some excellent brew. My opinion of Praha beautiful city with ancient architecture and lovely historic and cultural significance. However the Czech people take time to talk with tourist so don't be surprised if you do not find too many friendly faces, but once you break the ice they are fantastic. My last tip is if u do shop and have to claim tax free please make sure you fill up the form in your name, add and valid credit card and submit it to the tax refund centre in the city...the shop will explain it to you .Beware any mistake they will send you back to the shop. Once you flying out of and eu airport make sure you stamp the forms from customs and post it back to the tax company in the reply paid envelopes else you will be charged if they do not get it in 21 days. Please try the local krusta and creeps very tasty sweets.hope this helps. Thanks"

Only four other cities in Europe attracted more visitors than the Czech capital: London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome. I really love this city and especially the Old Town. As the first city that was rediscovered after the Iron Curtain fall, Prague has long since found its natural place as one of Europe's top destinations. A central European beauty, architecturally and culturally. Find yourself a cafe and let your creativity take control. Prague in the Czech Republic has grown to become one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, with many exciting things to see and a low cost. Prague was spared especially bombing during World War II, and thus appears today as one of Europe's most beautiful cities. If you also live at the \"old East European prices\" so we are left with a breathtaking nice feeling when you're back from vacation.Prague is a wonderful and well-preserved city with great architecture and a large amount of magnificent old houses, winding streets and famous sights such as. Charles Bridge, Old Town Square, Prague Castle M.M. In 1992 came the historic center on 886 hectares with a world heritage site. Prague's beauty is almost magical. Communism autocracy in the city lasted more than 40 years and until 1989 used only few tourists come to Prague. But although Prague was the capital of an Eastern Bloc country, the city has not been affected by this time in the same way as for example Warsaw or Bucharest. Magnificent buildings in Baroque style, royal palace, rich cultural life, small beer joints with good and cheap local beer as well as international fashion houses with stiff prices. Prague has it all."

Beautiful architecture in the old town, and surrounded by a host of restaurants and bars.This part of Prague is great both through the day and in the evenings, as it is always remains lively! Many fantastic picture opportunities to be had here, including the anatomical clock which you can take stairs to the top of and experience a wonderful view of Prague.One thing i would recommend is eating just outside of the old town however, as you will be paying top prices in restaurants and bars, whereas if you continue just out of the old town prices are much cheaper and there are some lovely restaurants to eat at."

Climb the clock tower for fantastic views over Prague (there is a lift but the climb is fine for the able bodied).\nWatch out for touts on segways constantly offering you segway tours. Theyre not aggressive but there are a lot of them."

The astronomical clock is right these to mesmerise you and tell you how time has passed by. The square had a lot of cafes restaurants. Dec - Jan will let you experience music as well as there is some band or the other playing. Walking around is amazing and you feel the air mixed with touristy chats, music , food everything. Must visit definitely. Important:- One thing that nagged me was the currency, if you pay in euro your change will be in czec crowns making you lose a lot of money. I don't understand why cant they follow euro when they are in the euro zone, this is one thing that makes life a bit difficult for a tourist."

Instead of changing for example 100 \u20ac at the normal rate giving 2500Kr, they change with a far lower rate to 1500Kr. When they give you back the money, they ask you to sign, do not do it !

I'm not sure if everyone is being serious on how cool this astronomical clock is, but my favorite part of it is definitely seeing everyone's disappointment on their faces when they aren't impressed by it - definitely second to Munich's, but if you think about how it was built several hundred years ago and still works, that's pretty cool in itself I guess!"

We took local bus service to the Castle and toured that fabulous structure and then we walked down to Mala Strada and had lunch in a local cafe and toured that part of the city on the other side of the Charles Bridge. Finished the day with a Chamber music concert. The food is not expensive even in the best of restaurants. The streets are fairly safe (occasional pickpocket) and the taxis you should get a price beforehand. You need at least three days to see most of the city but I would not hesitate to stay longer."

In front of the old clock tower, it is each hour pushing and pulling to get the best place at the moment the apostels appear. Watch out fro pickpockets at that moment ! Visit the square very early in the day to avoid all these crowds."

Personally, I thought the whole city was like a Disney movie in general - the way the castle is visible in most parts of Prague, at the top of the hill - that's what the settings are like in fairytales! In the square are plenty of food stalls as well as restaurants with terraces offering nice views of the city. I thought it was quite nice to simply sit down in the square with a hot drink (lots of seating available) and people watch! Located in the square is also the astronomical clock, which I visited. It was interesting and I don't recall having to wait long in queue for tickets to climb to the top of the old town hall tower. Directly opposite is the tyn church which looks very pretty when lit up in the evening.The chocolate museum is also in the same area which is worth taking a look at, as well as plenty of shops including Swarovski, Cartier etc. I'd visited Prague during winter of 2014 (TA will not enable me to choose the appropriate month/year). In my opinion, winter is probably the best time to visit, especially during Christmas. "

We loved the narrow, car-free streets, pretty and historic buildings, haphazard unplanned street layout reflecting its ancient historical development, and the constant busyness. a favourite location.We had a great half-day tour of the Jewish Quarter (Josefov) with Anna Kristyna Sion of Terezin Private Tours (details on their website). A very personable and pleasant person, she met us promptly at our apartment and led us on a well-paced walk through the district, including visits to the major sites such as the Maisel, Pinchas and Spanish synagogues and the Old Jewish Cemetery. Her English is very good, her knowledge is clearly very extensive, and she was able to give information and explanations very well and to field questions on what we were seeing as well as broader historical and Prague-wide questions. Her discussions conveyed her passion for the people, place and history while maintaining a good balance and lightness of touch. The synagogues, museums and cemetery have their own power, but she was also very good is providing an introduction then letting us experience each for ourselves. We were later told by another tourism operator that her fees are very reasonable and that a female guide is very unusual. One of the best private tours we have taken. We highly recommend Anna as a private guide."

The fact that it was snowing peacefully really helped set the atmosphere, as we wandered around the cobbled streets, taking pictures of all the buildings. It is unbelievable how everything can be so well preserved. Take care, though. As almost all the streets are cobbled, they tend to get quite slippery when snow sets on them, so make sure you have adequate shoes, such as boots, or rain boots. I suggest to not wear trainers or especially high heels. After I bought a better pair of boots, everything was perfect and I could enjoy Prague without slipping every five seconds.

It is a shame that the city has not controlled this and surrendered the charming old city into something akin to NYC Times Square."

The whole place is just something to be seen for your own eyes.The history here will spin you for ever and change you.On the minus side, don't change your euros or dollars for CHK here - expect rip offs. Pay by card. Remember, this is tourist central so prices are accordingly rated to this.I recommend you check out ally ways and roof top gardens / restaurants.

The square is very large and at the time of our visit quite filled with people. Majestic and magical like most of Prague, with wonderful glasshouse like cafes with gas heaters and blankets to observe the wonderful array of people sightseeing while drinking a nice coffee or wine. Definitely a must, plus you must pass it to access Astronomical Clock and 2 very nice churches."

Besides the beautiful architecture that surrounds the square, the festive additions of a huge Xmas tree fully illuminated and the Xmas market stalls made for a wonderful scene. Restaurants and cafes surround the square but the stalls provided substantial sausages, massive hams being spit roasted and mulled wine, mulled cider and czech beer to wash it down with. On News Years Eve we ate in one of the restaurants on the square and emerged just before midnight to find it snowing. In addition to the brilliant atmosphere and the fireworks, the snow finessed the event. Wonderful."

There was loads of activity in the Old Town but no life. Very few musicians or buskers (controlled?) It seemed exclusively the preserve of the tourists, and as such lacked any charm.

Each building, each narrow and wider street, are so perfectly well conserved and maintained that this part of the city is historically charming. I suggest a) read about the history before getting there or take a tour, it is most interesting and revealing b) start very very very early and avoid the crowds. This city is so popular that it get heavily crowded after 11:00. All imaginable nations are amongst the visitors. Every corner is worth to visit."

As Canadians, we are used to being polite but this doesn't go far here in Prague as each is seemingly out for themselves. However this didn't bother hinder us from going back to Old Town Square on multiple occasions. The Christmas tree is absolutely brilliant in more ways then one.

Just like any major tourist city in the world if you wish to sit and enjoy a coffee or beer at one of the numerous outdoor cafes you are going to pay for the pleasure. Eat and drink in the back streets its much cheaper and if you dinning you will find much better proper Czech cuisine."

Loved the grog and Terdelniks. The dough wrapped around a wooden pole and cooked over a fire then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. This simple sweet treat was my favorite thing to eat here.

I had the fortune of having an electronic friend in Prague before I came over for the Mind Sports Olympiad in 2001, so he was able to show me so many things that tourists might miss. For example, the average tourist visiting Old Town will find the restaurants that charge \"tourist prices\" but he knew where to take me so that we could both pay the \"native prices\" instead.Do not decide what to buy on the spur of the moment. Remember the items and prices that most interest you, then don't be surprised if you find a better item for a lesser price somewhere else.My visit was before they adopted the Euro, so I really got the \"native advantage\" in some places. I remember a pint of beer costing fifteen cents US equivalent, and over there, beer was a better choice for a drink with your meal than was the water.It is a beautiful place, and I hope to visit it again someday."

Also, it it well worth climbing (or taking the elevator) up to the top of the clock tower for incredible views of the square and the city.

It connected to the Vltava river at both of its ends. The moat is now covered up by the streets (from north to south-west) Revolu\u010dn\u00ed, Na P\u0159\u00edkop\u011b, and N\u00e1rodn\u00ed\u2014which remain the official boundary of the cadastral community of Old Town. Notable places in the Old Town include the Old New Synagogue, Old Town Square and Astronomical Clock. The Old Town is surrounded by the New Town of Prague. Across the river Vltava connected by the Charles Bridge is the Lesser Town of Prague. I visited in Dec. The Christmas market is all overy Prague, but of course, the biggest one is located in the old town. It has very good ambience and Christmas atmosphere, traditional roasted pork, traditional Czech dessert---Trdeln\u00edk, hot wine, etc is all over the market. My husband and I really enjoyed it."

This time, the Christmas Market was in full swing and made the square very crowded. The crowd was friendly despite the tight fit.I sampled much of the street fare and had mixed results. The beer is a given and amazingly cheap. The spiced wine was varied in quality. The best seemed like a warmed port rather than a spiced version of red table wine. The worst went right in the dumpster. The ham and sausages were tasty but the ham a bit pricey. And, do not use the bread as a roll (you will see). Only one cheese monger but stationed by a friendly woman who should be running the company. Some of the craftwork was very nice and I especially liked and purchased some amber/silver jewelry from Poland (Tomasz Debski).Nightlife went way later than I could handle being on a business trip. The food available surrounding the square and specifically behind the Tyn church is excellent. Everywhere walkable and Uber got me to and from the airport with ease. By all means, visit here."

The primary thing is the architecture which is simply stunning, along with a wonderful sense of history. Take your camera, take your time, wander and just indulge your senses.

Do be careful of the crowds when watching the \"clock\" since there are so many who want to see the display. Across the square from the clock at an Italian restaurant we had some excellent mushroom soup, duck & Caesar salads. On the castle grounds, St. Vitus stands out as one of the finest churches I have seen -- gargoyles, beautiful stained glass and exquisite architecture, and that amazing silver coffin. The Treasury has unique objects & reliquaries and they are perfectly maintained & displayed. Go to Prague in November if you can. We were able to walk right in to exhibits and enjoy them. Busy, but not overly crowded anywhere. And BTW, we stayed at the Four Seasons. The Four Seasons is, yes, a very nice hotel in a great location as expected, BUT, we best thing about it was that the service and hotel staff were perfect.. Have to say, we were very, very impressed - we were there 5 nights and every single day the service was perfect. That is a rare experience.

There were many shops for virtually all your needs and desires, as well as lots of great places to park your tush and watch the people. The people in all the shops and restaurants were very friendly and often spoke very good english. Take your camera! We also walked around the area, which was a couple of blocks from our Marriott hotel and the Charles Bridge, early in the morning when the streets were totally deserted--beautiful!!"

It is a long walk around the square but with the gorgeous buildings and roads I didn't feel tired."

It contains the famous Astronomical Clock, Old Town Square, Jan Hus's Monument and the old church, as well as many other interesting attractions. Due to the amount of historical events that took place in that area it is highly recommended to take a guided tour in Prague, which should also cover the Old Town square. In the same square there is a tourists office where you can find daily free tours in English and Spanish (very recommended). There are many restaurants there as well, but I do not recommend them because they are touristic (high prices)."

After few steps, he said Let me give you money right now. So without thinking anything I gave him USD 50. In exchange he gave me around 1400 CZCrona (that is what I thought).It turned out that it was Belarus Ruble (Exchange rate 1 USD = 18000 Belarus Ruble). So I got 10 Cents for 50 USD. I was told about this by restaurant waiter when I confidently put the money I got on the table. He also told me that I was not the first one to be cheated like this.So Enjoy your visit to Prague but NEVER EVER exchange money on the street.

On St. Nicholas's Day, the locals bring the kids in for a traditional talk with an angel who happens to be hanging out with the devil. The 2 figures team up to have frank discussions with children about whether they have been naughty or nice, and dole out sweet rewards to kids who were good that year. There are also daily holiday shows and entertainments. That said, I recommend skipping the square on the weekends, too crowded."

The astronomical clock is beautiful and the visit to the old Town Hall very interesting. But some things are upsetting, that you always have to be careful with your belongings, you have to look twice when you exchange your money because they have a bad rate or a big commission, like 28% ( there is a fare exchange on Narodni street, close to Karol Bridge, a blue one, but always ask how much CZK you get in exchange for your money, before you give them your money). It is better to pay with your credit card rather then euros, they have a bad exchange rate in shops. If you are on a budget, don't go on restaurant on the main streets. There are some nice restaurants in Jewish quarter too. If you can overlook the bad exchange rate ( and I suggest you do) you can have an amazing time in Prague, its a magical city!"

It has a huge square in the middle surrounded by breathtaking buildings of different architecture. There is a large statue of Jan Hus, a famous religious reformer. You will find most of the guided walking (free of paid) tours beginning from this place. Be ready to explore unique on-street entertainment. The square has the world famous (though amazingly complex) astronomical clock located on one of the corners of the place. Best time to start is early morning when it will be generally less crowded. Or you can come to this place during the close of trip, where you will find some benches to sit, relax and watch beautiful monuments and buildings surrounding the square."

We arrived by train with an easy transition to the old town. Excellent signage with little to no language barrier. While there were other guest, it was not as packed as it is during the summer. In addition to the glockenspiel which I love to watch, with pre planning you can attend multiple events from the ballet and concerts, many of the churches had free holiday and classical music concerts. The town square was full of small displays and vendors. My favorite was the Christmas Tree with a fantastic light system which was enhanced by the twinkling of the lights on the ice. As the people left due to the weather, I found this one of the most enjoyable times and made you think you were back in time. We had expected snow and it started out as that but it changed to sleet and freezing rain. Merchants and businesses were focused on meeting the needs of the customers from rugs and external heaters to lending umbrellas with the request to drop back off when it was not needed. The only challenge was the train system. Due to the ice, trains were significantly delayed. It was a challenge to determine what was happening I can not wait for my return. I do have to say that Prague holds a special place for me as my family is descendants of the Hussites and going there help me to understand the religious history of my family."

It gives some amazing views of the old city and seriously don't take too much pain to see the clock at hours. It's really not worth the pain. But surely read about the clock.

It has gothic building, cobblestone streets, and small shops on narrow streets. It's fun and beautiful and lives up to its reputation.Unfortunately, because of this, it also tends to be crowded. So, expects people everywhere. Expect to walk slowly and take your time. But, if it starts to get to you, there's probably going to be a coffee shop, pub, and/or restaurant on the next block to take a break.As picturesque and pleasant as it is, I'd recommend seeing the other parts of the city as well. Prague is a pretty unique city with a lot to see and do. People are friendly, most speak English, prices are affordable, and it has a ton of history and sights. Unless you're moving here, you're not going to have enough time. Plan accordingly."

He was very in depth with the information, some was a bit political but we just ignored it. He works for tips, we tipped him 900 crown which translated to about $36, this was close to what we would have paid for a tour that was not that personal or in depth. Vit was passionate about his city. We found him standing in front of the clock with a sign that said \"free tours by a native prague citizen\". His tour was really helpful once we toured the palace and could put things together, we were even able to purchase the short tour of the palace and cathedral."

There is so much to see it is better to try and work to a plan as nearly every corner you turn there is something of interest. The Jewish town was worth seeing as was the area across Charles Bridge, didn't do the Castle this time as we had been before but there are so many small streets, alleys and shops to explore it took a full days walking. A little map reading and preparation goes along way but everything seems well sign posted and even well after dark it seemed a safe and relaxing part of Prague."

There is a Hilton close by as well. Both hotels are nice. If you stay at either place, you will save on any bus tours, since most of Prague is enjoyed by walking through it and the hotels are close enough to do it. There are also malls near by (palladium) that have good shopping."

Although I really loved Vienna which I visited in August I never thought that Prague would top it but it has. Strangely enough the town isn't as beautiful as I'd expected but it has this crazy feel of old and new and music filled cobbled streets with horse drawn carriages and old timer convertibles and the tourists all look so happy. The people here are not the friendliest and appear grumpy most of the time in fact some of them are quite rude sometimes but even this doesn't destroy the charm of this place and rather adds to the character of Prague.The buildings are spectacular, the Charles Bridge beautiful. The old town has a lovely market filled with wooden toys and marionettes that have all been Hand made in the Czech Republic.We've walked these streets so many times in the last few days and done over 50 km in just 4 days but I could keep doing it. There are so many artists here especially on the Charles Bridge which has been closed to traffic and is only accessible on foot. Street musicians and performers, fire eaters, magicians and large bubble makers. Unfortunately so many homeless people begging too, which is sad because nobody in this world should have to do that! All in all Prague is top of my list for a holiday and I would return here in an instant"

Half way through there is a coffee and toilet break and they can still be held in the rain as long as you go prepared.Martin was an amazing guide, making our tour interesting, factual, entertaining and almost reducing us to tears with the personal stories relating to his family and political oppression which forced some difficult decisions to be made.If you want to find out more, you'll have to do Martin's tour to hear how these sagas unfolded!The free walking tour was so good that we booked to do the paid Castle tour in the afternoon and that was equally good.We have now done 5 Sandemans tours and recommend them to everyone. We're heading towards retirement and are fit and able, so they're not just for youngsters and are definitely the best way to see and get to know a new city.Their payment is in the form of a 'tip' - you decide how much you think the tour was worth. We've always felt inclined to be generous with our tips as we have had 1/2 day of entertainment, exercise, good company, photo opportunities, plus geography and history lessons, without the boredom of a classroom!Thanks Martin from Prague."

Don't miss out on see the 27 crosses at the base of the tower that the clock is on. They are located on the ground near the small park with trees facing the square.

The statue of Jan Hus is a fitting tribute to a man who was burned at the stake for his beliefs. It's also a lively place with restaurants, shops and street performers.

A few blocks from the Old Jewish Quarter, surrounded by grand cathedrals, churches, and picturesque buildings, and adjacent to the Astronomical Clock (with wonderful views from the tower), it is a great place to spend time. It is frequently livened up by street performers, and a great place to view the hustle of horse-drawn carriages, classy tourist vehicles, and segway tours. Indoor and outdoor cafes abound and the streets around it are filled with opportunities for interesting photos.

We loved dining in the various cafes, drinking beer, taking photos, people watching.. we ate at the food stalls, terrific food. Yes, the cafes directly on the square are a tad more costly than cafes a few streets over. And we visited the cafes on adjacent streets as well. it's all good. it's all about having an experience and enjoying the sights, sounds and atmosphere of the place. It was all-around goodness. If you are a photographer of any level, you will adore Old Town and the adjacent streets, all of them. And you'll want to walk them repeatedly. You just won't be able to help yourself.It gets crowded by the clock. But even then, it's an experience not to be missed (at the top of the hour). From Old Town you can walk to the Opera House area, and have tea and goodies at tea time...or eat in the outside cafe at all hours of the day, and the food there is fantastic.

The square takes on a new life at night, entertainers, buskers and flame dancers to name a few. Plenty of eating places to choose from and reasonable prices too. During the day the shops are terrific, you can get anything you want and the souvenir shops are good value. The Astronomical clock is there too, crowds are thick but it's tall and you get a good shot of the figures parading around the tower."

There is something to see at every turn in Prague. There is something to eat at evergy turn also. A walk across the bridge to the Prague Castle is more than worth the effort.

Old Town Prague is full of beautiful buildings, quiet streets, great little restaurants and bistros. The area is safe and it's an easy walk to everything one could want to see, the Mucha Museum, the Kafka Museum, the Astrological clock, the Dancing Houses... I could go on and on. There's an excellent tram system, that was undergoing renovations when we were there, if walking is an issue. I highly recommend a visit, even if your hotel is not in the Stare Mesto, it is worth a visit!"

There are Blues Clubs just behind the church with the big black spires, there are so many great restaurants catering for tourist palates and in the daytime the tourist buses leave from the square for day tours. Of course don't forget the segue tours on offer also. We used the black spires as our markers to navigate our way back to the square from wherever we were in Prague. Enjoy!"

            "review": "A Truly Unforgettable Experience. We decided to spend our trip walking Prague as opposed to navigating the confusing metro system, and as our hotel was located in the Zizkov district, on the outskirts of the centre of Prague, it meant we endured a walk into the Old Town on most days and evenings.As we were based in Zizkov we entered the old town from east of the Vltava river, the scenery during our walk consisted of old gothic buildings housing seedy businesses and tired looking shops, ominous factories no longer in use and the looming highway bridge overhead, the supporting pillars of which riddled with graffiti and litter. However, once this seemingly eerie journey was over the views changed dramatically, a short time further into central Prague and the cold soviet-esque surroundings become an area which really does hold up to it's title of the 'Paris of the east'.Upon entering the old town border we were met with the powder tower gate, the original city gate separating the old town from the new town. Once under the gate you could almost feel like you've travelled back in time, especially at night when the day tourists return to their abodes. However the plethora of souvenir shops and aggressive Romanian street sellers puts a dampener on what could be a romantic and historical walk around this gothic paradise. When you reach the old town square where things really get going, my trip took place over the week leading up to Christmas which meant that markets were in full swing, for a few weeks the old town square is transformed into something out of a fairy-tale, home made craft stalls, local artists and confectionary sellers all itching for you to come in and view what they have to offer. The smell of mulled wine and German meats fills the air rising up above the enormous Christmas tree deluged with lights and decoration provided by the city.There is so much to see and experience it is hard to know where to start, a tour round the markets, a bite to eat in one of the squares many restaurants, exploring a souvenir shop or even having a ridiculously cheap pint (or few) at a local beer hall.A good place would probably be to venture up the clock tower on the edge of the square, you can tackle the many flights of stairs or take a ride in the lift, however once near the top a winding staircase will have to be climbed whichever method you choose initially. This portion of the experience was painstakingly long due to a very nervous woman in front of us who achieved one step every 2-3 minutes but simultaneously blocked the narrow stairwell, not for those who are afraid of heights is my advice.Once at the top you find yourself in the tight and narrow viewing platform which is completely open to the elements on all sides, however this is undoubtedly the second best view in Prague especially as the bright and lively markets run underneath you.In my opinion the best view of Prague can be found by taking the long and steep walk to the castle, there is a point as you are walking up the final hilly approach which is high and open enough to be able to see the whole of Prague, the scale of which cannot be described without visiting. I felt like I could stand their for hours on end and just appreciate the triumphs of those who built this architectural haven all those years ago.My final hotspot would have to be the Charles Bridge, it is amazing by day but even more romantic by night, this old bridge spanning the width of the Vltava houses such emotion and awe that it is almost indescribable. As I walked through the mist past beggars crouched on the sides of the bridge, a mark of respect in the city, an old blind man played old baroque pieces on his accordion, crows stood on the old lamps and statues that line the bridges walls. Standing on the edge of the empty bridge in the early hours of the morning looking over the river was my favourite part of the whole trip.In light of my recommendations I believe that the old town is a place to be wildly explored and not to stick rigorously to a map or tourist guide, and it's even more beautiful when the sun goes down.The nightlife isn't bad either."

The architecture is stunning. Markets have some lovely traditional stuff in them, people are really friendly & the food can be excellent.Beware of pickpockets, although we were fine.

You will pay a premium in the restaurants and cafes for the view. Most of the restaurants are cheaper to eat inside than sitting outside in the square and the toilets are free to customers. If you want to eat more cheaply go down the side streets a little way from the square or get some food from the local bakery, deli or mini market and eat on the seats by the statue to watch the sights. Lots of tours gather here in the mornings if you hover nearer by you might gather some free info on the clock tower etc. Lots of touts here trying to book you up for tours and people driving around on sedgeways. We found our own way around the sights map in hand. Be carefull of pick pockets in these crowded areas."

Old Town (Stare Mesto) is definitely the main attraction area in central Prague as evidenced by the large mass of tourists present just about every day of the week. If you enjoy taking in old world buildings and atmosphere then this is the place to do it in Prague. You must enjoying traveling on foot as there are few (if any) parking opportunities for cars to park in this section of the city. We took many, many pictures in this section of the city so lots to see. Two minor issues were that there we lots of people it has been \"discovered\". Also, the restaurants are very overpriced in this section of the city so save yourself a few dollars and find someplace just off the main streets around Old Town Square. The quality is just as good but it's less crowded and less expensive."

There is the Medieval center with the Old Town Square, the entrance to the Charles Bridge, the Astronomical Clock, several churches. But it is also home to the Jewish Quarter and many latter buildings, especially the Art Nouveau era buildings, And for those so inclined there is what a friend called Gay Alley (Parizska St) leading from the square to the river with upscale shops such as Mont Blanc, Cartier, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and many other high end stores.Filled also with restaurants, bars, and hotels it is, in my opinion, the place to stay and from where to start your exploring.One of things that is most amazing about Prague in my opinion is the buildings. Not just the old buildings but the more modern with statuary and painted d\u00e9cor. A truly beautiful city."

Old Town square is probably the first major attraction in Prague that most tourists visit, and for a good reason to, because it showcases stunning examples of art, architecture, history and culture that span over one thousand year. Without having to walk any great distance, a visitor can see the town hall with the Astrological Clock to one side, the Gothic St Tyn Church and the Baroque St Nicholas Church. The square buzzes with street performers, amature and professional photographers and people relaxing at a number of outdoor pubs and restaurants. The square is the heart of Old Town. One can reach other points of interest such as Charles Bridge, Prague Castle, The lesser Town, Kafka\u2019s Museum and numerous other sites easily on foot."

This is a beautiful hotel with in walking distance of Old Town and also, The Charles Bridge. The hotel is very accommodating,making dinner reservations for us in Old Town, arranging a boat tour of the area as well as booking transportation for us to the airport at the end of our stay. It has wonderful views of the river and the bridge. Our room was delightful. It was a large room with sitting area, a coffee and refreshment bar, and a beautiful bath with separate tub and shower. The hotel has a very good dining room with views of the water from many of the tables and a terrace with tables and lounging areas. The walk to Old Town was pleasant with lots of shops and places to have dinner or just a snack. Some of the streets in Old Town are lined with trees and there are parks with statues and flowers. There is much to see and do there."

There are metro stops, but they are not particularly close to each other, and there aren't many, so you still may have a hefty walk to reach the tourist sites. We spent the better part of an afternoon just wandering around Old Town and taking pictures of the beautiful buildings and watching street performances."

We waited for the Astronomical clock to strike the hour to see the apostles appear from the little windows as the guide books promised. The clock is absolutely lovely, but the apostles do not come out like a cuckoo clock, they just pass by the window on the inside. You barely get to see them at all. Smartphones will not record this very well unless you have zoomed in on the windows before they open.The entire Stare Mesto area is compact and easy to walk. In fact we walked everywhere during our visit, from the Old Town to the castle, the Jewish quarter etc. We also walked across Charles Bridge after dark, and while the lighting is dim, we felt quite safe. at 9pm"

It's so charming in Old town, and sure, everyone will tell you to steer clear of the overpriced touristy restaurants, but sometimes you just want to pay for location. I am a tourist so I don't mind paying extra occasionally to people watch in the middle of the square. Had a great experience here."

Highlights: Old town sq, Tyn Church, Havelske Namesti, Male Namesti, Karluv Most, Josefov, Astronomical Clock. It is really beautiful. Take three to four hours to stroll here, it is magnificent. Be sure to see the astronomical clock in action, best is at 11 or 12 am. You can even sit at a cafe opposite it, but prices are a little bit higher. I also went to the Josefov, it is preety interesting, fantastic story. Overall, it is packed with tourists, the whole old town, exceptionally the Charles Bridge.

Thousands gathered to watch the Astrological Clock do its thing (a bit of a let down) at the top of the hour. Street performers were out in full force. The restaurants and shops were busy. There's even a statue of Jan Hus! What's not to enjoy? Others will tell you it's too crowded or over priced...and maybe they're right. But if this is what you like, then sit down, have a beer and enjoy!"

It would require military planning to cover all places of interest, but to be frank sometimes it's just great to sit and watch the world go by. One thing that really got on my nerves were the numerous and frankly dangerous segways, These monstrosities are allowed everywhere, pavement, road, squares!!...It is beyond belief that the local municiples has issued permits to these ridiculous machines designed for the truly lazy. Don't people realize how idiotic they look, on these so called modern machines, against the backdrop of this beautiful ancient city.

From small food stalls right through to lovely restaurants. The highlight of the square is the Astronomical clock however given the attraction of it being over and done with in less than a minute I would recommend visiting in the morning early on to avoid the crush..... There are a variety of street performers and way too many people selling segway trips in the centre of the square so watch out for pick pockets however thats about as unsafe as it gets... Single female travellers would be extremely safe in this area and in Prague in general."

Enjoy these streets themselves not just as the way from point A to point B. You can appreciate the design of cities centuries ago. Usually street signs are at corners at the base of the second story (first story European numbering). However, sometimes these are not immediately found. However, I usually got where I wanted to go, although since the streets are not straight you have to keep this in mind."

The buildings are much more colorful than we find in America. The St. Charles bridge has become the latest spot for couples to put locks on the fencing over the bridge. Many statues, good photography of the river and sunsets are to be had. Plenty of high-quality independent stores with jewelry, fashions and much more. Good cafes and restaurant. And it was all very inexpensive - at least 15-20% cheaper than Austria and Germany."

The square and the cobbled lanes radiating out from it were jammed with clueless tourists from many lands, a walking Tower of Babel. (Flat shoes with rubber soles are a must!) Elaborately embellished Baroque buildings stood cheek by jowl. Statues, friezes, religious and bucolic scenes rendered in paint and mosaics adorned the fronts. Venturing down a side street, we ducked into St. Joseph\u2019s Capucine Church, with its interior done in a more restrained Baroque style \u2013 carved dark wood, varnished and adorned with occasional gilding. We also peered into St. Jacob\u2019s, a larger and more elaborate Baroque church and strolled past the Estates Theater, a pistachio-green confection where Mozart premiered \u201cDon Giovanni.\u201d"

This made it difficult to find our way to Hard Rock cafe even though it was only a few minutes walk.

The Old Town is a place that, without a guide, you'd miss so much detail as you wander through.As with all tourist areas, there are numerous stalls and shops selling souvenir tat and food, but there are gems hidden in those places. Don't stop at the first place you come to, explore. Go down the side streets, have a look at what's around the next corner. You'll find some great little places that the bigger, attention-grabbing places steal you away from. We learned this early on during our holiday.I recommend a walking guide if you're fit and able. They show you so much, point out the subtle details and the marvellous history of the towns that make up the heart of Prague. The Charles Bridge is a whole story in itself. Go early if you want to catch it at it's uncrowded best. By the afternoon, it is jammed packed with tourists and sellers alike. An efficient transport system links the various areas of Prague, so everything is within easy reach. Though even on foot, the old town is not that long to walk its length, but all of the interesting places in between is what slows you down.

We visited it three times but a visit during the night as well as during the day to enjoy the grand old architecture of the surrounding buildings is worth the visit. Although quite safe these days but it is worth keeping an eye out for pickpockets who may take advantage of crowded narrow paths. Best to only carry enough money which is required for the day and to split it in different pockets. We did not eat there as it seemed too crowded at places."

I advise to plan your walking route, starting from the powder tower, following Celetn\u00e1 to the old town square (church of our lady before Tyn, astronomical clock), and then approach the Charles bridge and bridge tower. Conveniently, you can follow the road up to reach the castle district."

At the risk of contradicting myself, go to Charles Bridge (many tourists) and you can buy great local cafts there... no Russion dolls,Thai massage joints or McFried food. Better still, if you want to see some amazing art deco residential architcture, wander up to Zizkov, just behind the train station and have a look at the top of the Park.

The abound medieval monuments, cobble stone Alleys, eclectic bridges with breath taking adornments and the reflection of the architectural treasures in the Vltava river all left me with an indelible impression about this unforgettable destination. There is absolutely nothing austere, chichi or garish about the Old Town and the lesser town quarters, perhaps a well deserved credit to a propitious and highly revered king Charles IV of the 14th century who is responsible for these resounding aesthetics. The main tourist attractions are concentrated in the Old Town, New Town and the Lesser Town districts all in walking distances. We started our journey from the famous Powder Tower the 15th century gate to Prague, into Old Town square then to Charles Bridge over to Lesser Town and visited many historical sites such as \u201cTyn Church\u201d, City hall and the astronomical clock, Charles Bridge, St Nicholas Church, Lennon wall, Kampa Island and much more that I can enumerate in this review. A half day visit to Prague Castle (the largest castle according the Guinness Book) in Lesser Town is a MUST, hence please DO NOT leave Prague without this experience. In the evening we visited the amazing Wenceslas Blvd in New Town, a conflation of medieval, Art Nouveau and modern structures interspersed with plenty of shops, restaurants, bars and night clubs (please refrain going into side streets if brothels doesn\u2019t stroke your fancy). For shopping opportunities certainly visit Depo Hostiva\u0159 shopping outlet (there were plenty of brands often on sale with 60% to 90% OFF), OC Chodov (the exchange Venue here offers highly competitive rates), OC Let\u0148any all accessible by city railway system (metro). If you prefer to shop in the tourist districts the Palladium shopping Mall is in walking distance in New Town in addition to all the souvenir shops around. If you are looking for Rodeo drive or Champs-Elysees kind of shopping expedition, please visit the Parizska Street in the Old Town and while there swing over to the Metronome Park ONLY steps away and visit the giant metronome and get a breath of fresh air. The Czech Republic is known for its Bohemian Crystals; the most top rated brands are \u201cBlue\u201d and \u201cMoser\u201d crystals that can be found around the Old Town Square. The out of town excursion to the Crystal factory can also be a unique experience. Certainly, an evening visit to the lovely \u201cFolklore Garden\u201d for an unforgettable experience of folklore dance, music, full course dinner and all you can drink (beer, wine and soft drinks) should be part of the itinerary. Please be very vigilant of pickpocketting in crowded areas. Currency exchange can be challenging at times, in order to avoid duplicitous and fraudulent situations, always ask them to write the exact final amount of the transaction prior exchanging. Some vendors might try to ream the customer in cash transactions, so counting the returned change before the clerk at the register is highly advised for the accuracy. And finally, GOOD LUCK to you for being smart to choose this destination."

One could argue that my older age was a factor in my loss of love for the city but I'm not sure. I found the city so over commercialised and in ways, it seems, to have sold it's soul to the old devil that is Tourism. It may be incorrect but I read an article that said Prague was the most visited city in Europe and I don't think this is positive thing for the people who live there nor for the curious traveller. There are only so many souvenir shops filled with tat that one can bear. There are only so many terrible and overpriced cafes and restaurants that one can stomach.

However, once the bus stopped at Old Town, it made the trip worthwhile. This area just seemed so magical, with the colourful buildings, impressive fountains and clock tower, and everyone seeming so happy to be there. Since this was a hot day, there was a truck that sprinkled water over people, and this gave a sense of fun to the whole experience. There are many restaurants, souvenir shops, and ice cream shops in this area, so there's a ways to spend your time. There are also benches scattered around in case you want to rest and watch the entertainment, which includes dancing and bubble-making. Take the time to explore this area as even the shop windows are interesting! I wish I had room in my suitcase for some of the glassware as they were definitely beautiful."

We particularly enjoyed the food in the restaurant opposite the clock and the tiny (you could almost miss it) cafe/restaurant at the end of the square.

Price is also acceptable only if you look carefully on menus which shown in different languages and the surprising service charge on the BILL!Trdeln\u00edk is a traditional and delightful dessert you must try in the square. you can see stalls are selling hot and fresh baked Trdeln\u00edk!It is not difficult to find characteristic souvenir although most of the shops sell the same thing.Exchange stores are around, showing attractive exchange rate but be aware of once again, commission which could surprise you again.Most of people you meet there are nice and friendly, they show you how lovely is this land. Locals, children, visitors, buskers, everyone gather in the square and sharing the happiness of this beautiful and historic town.In summary, it is highly recommended to ones who'd love to visit Prague."

Four times in Pragues in 4 succesive years and the old town of Prague still appealed to us.it is rare to have a feeling in this popular tourist attraction , that you are not constatly ripped off. I experience the atmophere to be relaxed and not so pushy. The main plaza is the center of it. There seems always be something going on. A jazz festival, other presnters and a crowd milling around. Very likeable.However, the farther you get from the main plaza, the more rapid the prices fall.Beer-index shows triple price in the central plaza compared to 100 m off the place.Food has been good all over the old town, no actual disappointments. It is actually pretty hard to find bad quality / price relationship in Prague restaurants, which ain't such a bad a thing.Also there has been so far no attempts to relieve us of our money without our acceptance or through a scam.In other words, a lot of happy people and and good service.A good place to go, too."

Flat shoes a must. Exchange some money at no commission site. A bit cheaper with Czech money. Asking for something at restaurant can make bill more - like butter for bread or taking away leftovers, so ask if there's a charge. Everyone will try to sell you concert tickets. The Royal Czech Orchestra was worth every penny. Small venues so cheapest tickets are still good. Be sure you know which venue. My hotel gave me wrong location and I missed beginning of concert.

The down side is that there are far too many tourists here. We were there midweek, thus missing the weekend drunken hordes, but it was still too crowded for our liking. There are so many Costas and Starbucks that it was hard to find a Czech coffee house. To be fair to Costa, their styling really tries to blend in so that it almost appears to be a local operation. Likewise McDonald's with their understated \"McCafe\" branding. However, Burger King and Subway were unwelcome visual intrusions - worst of all was KFC, a ubiquitous blot on the otherwise magnificent streetscapes."

We were a stag party staying for 5 days at the top of town (hotel EA Downtown) and you had to traverse a small park near the Muzeum metro with down and outs/drug fiends before hitting the main part of town. The city is packed with tourist hordes during the day and pimps by night. However, there is a lot to see and do and check out my other reviews which cover some of the pubs and restaurants we visited, activities and zoo etc. A long weekend will not be sufficient to get around. As the Czechs are not in the euro, the cost of food and drink is quite cheap (and there's a lot of competition) - I was pleasantly surprised at just how little I spent (but then again my wife was not in tow!).Would be happy to return once the smoking ban kicks in!"

I asked her what is the method to recognize a street or avenue, but she nodded and said, \"that's not important\". I said, \"it is, I am lost\". And she said, \"look at the map\".

We went several times throughout our stay in Prague, and it seems to always be very crowded. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to go there, but if you're already there...why not?!?! The area does have several cafes with outdoor seating, which is nice for a break. There are also several food trucks with an assortment of local cuisine. Be warned, food is sold by weight in these trucks...not a flat rate. So when you see them stacking the sauerkraut on your plate, keep in mind you'll be paying by the gram."

The Old Town Square is amazing according to historical view, but especially during the days it is really crowdy. There are many ostensibly czech attractions like \"living\" statues, parrots and other crap. The restaurants are overpriced and not so good as anywhere else in Prague. If you want to enjoy the \"old\" and calm atmosphere of Old Town, go there during the night. It is magical."

Well worth a good staring at but we didn't bother with going up to the top of the tower, it was a bit busy.

Very few cities in Europe have maintained a period look, and Prague's old town certainly has it. Whether by choice or simply slow at it, Prague has not modernized this part of the city thereby enabling travelers like ourselves to experience an old Europe feel. The architecture is over hundred years old, so are the streets. The restaurants are ok, nothing great, but fun to hang out. Street food is avoidable. Look out for shows in the market place. all in all a great hang out place."

We were escorted inside this pitch black interior by a blind guide who showed us to our seat .and we were served drinks completely in the dark using tokens as credit. (Not a glimmer of light). We could hear the voices of other customers but could not see a thing! After about half an hour, drinks finished, we were escorted outside into the bright glare of the sun.This cafe was only there for about a week and apparently travels around to other cities.What a wonderful but unnerving experience.

Marteka showed us out-of-the-way niches we would have never discovered on our own or with a large tour group. The real value was in her discussions of what it was like to live in Prague under the former regime and how, as a teenager, she reacted to the enormous transition that took place in 1989.

It is now in Prague 1. Notable places in the Old Town include the Old New Synagogue, Old Town Square and Astronomical Clock. Across the river Vltava connected by the Charles Bridge is Mal\u00e1 Strana (\"Lesser Quarter\"). Josefov is located in the northwest corner of Old Town heading towards the Vltava. According to ancient records, the city had around 13 gates, and a huge moat, providing strong defenses.Old Town (Stare Mesto) Prague, Czech Republic has so very much to offer. It is truly filled with exquisite beauty throughout this centuries old region. To me it is not only one of the most beautiful regions in all of Europe but also one of the most interesting.

It's a real medieval city center, just over the over the river from a real medieval castle and cathedral. You couldn't invent this place. Statues, music, cafes everywhere, plus old bronze statues and new modern art installations all chock-a-block but harmonious. When we go again, though, we'll not go in June or any of the high season - remember this was TripAdvisor's #5 tourist destination for 2014, and those medieval streets are narrow! Crowds aside, though, it was not to be missed. Plan at least four hours just to walk around and gawk, and stop for the occasional refreshment when your feet hurt."

Though one myself, the sheer pressure of tourist groups being shepherded is forbidding, though having a guide take you around on foot - nigh on imperative. All food and drinks in the main square are up to triple the cost a few blocks away; but the views... Shops, bars, etc seem to cater to the median to lower average denominator, with some exceptions. Don't hurry, try to take it all in slowly."

Of course it is crawling with tourists, but, hey, you and I are probably tourists or we wouldn't be on TripAdvisor. The wonderful clock draws thousands of tourists every hour; it only lasts for 29 seconds, but it's pretty cool. We found the shops to not be total ripoffs. The jewelry shops begin with fairly high prices, but are polite in haggling down to about the same prices as you would spend away from the square, and the quality seems quite good. The nice thing about Old Town is that it is visually stunning, having not been damaged (much) during WWII. Also, it's nice to just relax, have some ice cream or beer or one of those round pastry things and enjoy the day."

The history of the interactions among the Czechs, Germans and Jews is a thumbnail sketch of the modern struggle to integrate diverse cultural groupings.If I were visiting, I would not stay in the old town, but the much more active and interesting other side of the river."

It is SO well preserved and not as over-cleaned, over-styled and packed with Designer stores as in Vienna. It feels more real for lack of a better term. Cross the Charles bridge from the south (Old City) and the other end is like walking into a town 500 years ago. Much too crowded during peak tourist season of course, especially on weekends. Would be ideal in March or September perhaps, when it would be less packed with tour groups. (See my other review about the Charles Bridge for a hint of a perfect viewing spot, high up above the crowds). Everywhere we walked, it was WOW! We'd turn a corner, look up, and another WOW!"

Should you find your way to the old town square you will find great eating places , entertainment in the form of buskers and beautifully preserved buildings . The astronomical clock is a must see . My advice to those wanting to photograph the clock minus the hoards or tourists is to go around 6 am in the morning . There are generally a few people around with the same purpose in mind but it will give you the opportunity to photograph it minus 100s of unknown people . The same goes for the Charles Bridge. While visiting the square or the entrance to the Charles Bridge on the Lesser Town side you will notice vintage cars that are available for hire , including the driver for around 50 Euro . This is a great way to see the city of Prague in style . The driver will take you from the square up to the castle and back while sightseeing all the places in between . Great way for an introductory crash course . I found that the store owners , buskers , etc are not too pushy . You never feel overwhelmed by them . They don't get irritated if you don't tip them , even though it is appreciated when you do . Everyone we spoke to from Prague showed great pride in their city . This all helped to create a wonderful holiday experience . I would highly recommend Prague to all . One good piece of advice -take good walking shoes !"

Prague Orloj is a medieval astronomical clock located at the Old Town Hall with the clock was first installed in 1410, making it the third-oldest astronomical clock in the world and the oldest one still working.Among many churches, the Baroque St. Nicholas Church and the tower at the Old Town Hall offers fabulous views over the Old Town. An art museum of the Czech National Gallery is located in Kinsk\u00fd Palace.It is worth enjoying the Square early in the morning or at dusk as the buildings light up and illuminate the glorious history the Prague offers."

I was roaming around looking for a place to eat and ended up at a vendor roasting a pig over an open flame. They cut off a hunk, weigh the plate and, toss on a wedge of bread. Everything thing seems to come with bread their. I also had a local Pilsner and went to one of the bar top tables nearby and just watched the hundreds of people going by or the various entertainers. All totaled it was something like $6US. The tables are shared by other locals and tourists and it is a great way to meet people. The food was great, the people better and with a feel of centuries gone by no better place to hang out. If you prefer a sausage, there are options. My friend had a kielbasa, also served with a hunk of bread. Don't like beer? Have some hot wine. Kids? Have a local sweet called a Trdlenik. I don't effusively write about eating experience but if you are in Prague, do as I did. Skip the tourists \"value\" menus, roll up your sleeves, grab a plate and take it the sites and sounds.

At first it is so overwhelming, but eventually you examine all the little nooks and crannies and see everything. I was in absolute awe. The Segway people are not allowed to advertise on the square which keeps it so genuine. So they ride around in regular clothes. DO IT!!!! It was the BEST part of my Prague trip... riding the Segway ALL OVER!!! It was easy and so so so so much fun. I could make it go super slow like walking, as I went through crowds of people. I am a 66 year old woman and it saved my legs from walking too much. I did it everyday for three days. Ask for the \"Russians\" They will take good care of you! They are extremely nice young guys. My guide kept turning around to make certain I was okay and went at my pace. You will find the guys on Segways all over Old Town Square. It is such a fun way to see Prague. I was castled out as I've been traveling for a month, so taking the Segway up to the top was just perfect. Find the hidden garden! A must. It is a little entrance right outside the Malostranska Metro Station. We parked/locked the Segways and went inside to find an exquisite garden with a white peacock! This garden is super beautiful and takes only a minute to see. In old town square behind the TYN church is The Indian Jewel where I ate everyday. It is that good and so easy to find when you are tired. I had NO IDEA Prague would be so fascinating!"

As with any other high-traffic tourist place, the immediate area of shops and restaurants are pricier - worth walking a few blocks in, in any direction, to get something of equal or even better quality, a stone throw away. Bring very comfortable shoes as just about every passage/walkway is cobblestoned. At night, Prague is known to be central Europe's party centre - so there will be some drunkenness and people walking with beer bottles in their hand - although at peak times and crowds, there is local police there, although maybe not enough for the hordes of people that gather there."

I myself love to stroll around midnight at this ancient market, every time I see details that I have never seen before ... like in a brocade lace dress with thousands of beautiful colorful steentjes..When ever you go and after comeback ... it's always a new amazing experience.

The architecture like the rest of the city is awe inspiring. There are countless places to eat and drink, I would recommend the Irish bar in the top right conner of the square away from the weather clock, the staff and food are top draw my wife and I eat there twice over our 4 day stay and were never disappointed. It's a different story at night and is a very tranquil place were you can enjoy a stroll amongst the churches and winding streets."

At that time there is somekind of Easther Market there, where people selling lot of delicious food,hot wine, souvenirs and even a pony stand where kids can take picture with the pony.Becareful with pickpockets in this area. Be very becareful, because they dress up well enough that you dont think they are pickpockets."

We made a few wrong turns and got to explore the quaint streets. Just have a good map and it's easy to return to Old Town.. Charles bridge was a huge disappointment. Years ago it was nothing but vendors but now they control who can sell and trust there were only about a dozen artist and jewelry. The cafes have outside seating so people watching is amazing---they provide blankets on cold days. Such an awesome idea."

The square itself has seen a number of invasions over the ages, with the majority of stag do's now migrating deeper into Eastern Europe the void is now filled with segways. You cannot move across the square without being offered a \"free try or a tour\" on the 2 wheeled vehicles. The problem is worse on the Charles Bridge exacerbated by its narrowness with segways weaving their way between the mass of pedestriansPS: I tried to find a photo of a maniacal segway rider brutally ploughing into a group of innocent children to illustrate my point. Disappointingly though no photo exists"

Also quite an interesting building - tours given in English.

U will be transported back in time with the market stalls and street foods in the cobbled main square, surrounded by churches and old houses... one can easily spend half a day taking in the sights and sounds and sampling the local cuisines.make sure you dont eat at the restaurants on the main square though - they are tourist traps- venture into one of the alleys and u will find far more authentic local cuisines and lower prices."

There is so much to look at and take it that you need multiple visits to the area to fully take it in. There are so many historical sites and beautiful old buildings that you feel like you have gone back in time. The restaurants and shops around the area are all in old buidings or in the traditional stalls so they do not look out of place. Yes there are the typical touristy trinket shops but no one bothers you to come in, so you just ignore them. The fact that every day there could be something different going on in the square made each visit that much more interesting. There was always someone or some group acting, singing, performing or displaying something that would catch your attention. You could spend hours just watching and wandering and not get bored.The atmosphere in this area is just beyond words. You feel welcomed. You feel almost 'at home'. We were in Prague for 3 months and must have been there a dozen times and each time you found something different and awe inspiring. I really recommend this area, but especially for those that appreciate thousand year old buildings and history. A must 'must see'!!"

Good idea to visit early of a morning when it is not crowded and you can click away to your hearts content. Easter markets selling decorated eggs, lots of food stalls with lots of customers.

That man was capable of such craftsmanship, building beautifully detailed structures that have withstood the centuries, simply using a few simple tools is amazing. The Old Town offers an abundance of cafes, bars and restaurants, many of which have outdoor seatings to people watch. A street musician or two can often be found in the main square or take a stroll around the market or stores, soaking in the ambience and the history. Language is not a problem, particularly in the stores and the locals are friendly and will make an effort to understand you. If you like walking and soaking up history, Prague is the perfect location. Ladies, I suggest you wear low heels or better yet, flat shoes. Cobblestone streets are everywhere in Prague and can prove hazardous with heels, turn your ankle and ruin your trip. The tram system is cheap and very easy to navigate. If you have an opportunity, do take a trip outside Prague - many of the small towns and villages are interesting and some quite picturesque."

It is worth walking up the side streets poss more than the main areas as this is the old and unspoilt Prague that you have come to see. All of it needs to be found so you get a real feel of what it's all about. A quick stop at one of the street vendors selling various types of sausage in a bread finger roll for about 40/60 czk (\u00a31.50) is a must."

Everywhere you look it's hard not to be struck by the age and beauty here. A few locals and a tour guide told me 'this is the heart of Prague'. Beautiful architecture, quaint roads and monuments are features of this very historical and significant place. If you're looking for a tour, there are plenty on offer from here. My tip is to ask for one that is certified. From here you can go off in many directions and discover lovely cafes, museums, gift shops and more. The further from here you go, the cheaper the prices so shop around before committing to a restaurant or retail purchase."

One can find there plenty of interesting sights, nice churches from romanesque one through gothic to baroque. You can also find many nice houses that were rebuilt and you can see romanesque or gothic cellars and renaissance facades. typical example is Old Town Square. During the construction of one of the houses under the main gothic church on the square (T\u00fdnsk\u00fd chr\u00e1m) builders discovered original gothic facade hidden under modern rennaissance facade. The house At the Bell (U Zvonu) was kept as it was built originally. You can discover also nice and quiet streets and yards inside the old houses, and many other sights. Do not forget to visit Ungelt, one of the few renaissance palace behind the St Tynus cathedral). You can virtually pass couple of centuries in five minutes. Just start between U Zvonu and st. Tynus cathedral (gothic), pass the narrow street to the Ungelt (renaissance), go through the Ungelt and end the walk at st. James church with its baroque interior and famous organ. You can of course visit st. Tynus cathedral where Tycho de Brahe, famous Danish astronomer and predecessor and colleague of Johannes Kepler rests in peace. You can also visit gallery At the Bell (U Zvonu) and if you are lucky enough, you can stop at st. James church and hear nice organ concerto. The walk from Old Town Square to st. James church can take you 5 minutes, but also couple of hours. And it is just one small part of the Old Town. Other directions have other attractions. Enjoy Prague. Vb"

You can see Old Town in many ways through the eyes of tourist as one of the most romantic places in the world. As student of history you can see thousend of spires from the tower like Jind\u0159i\u0161sk\u00e1 or Pet\u0159\u00edn and any architectonic style you can imagine. As a pilgrim you can visite hundrets of churches, chaples or rotundas to satisfy your soul. But if you looking for quite place try not use Celetn\u00e1, Karlova street and Old Town squere. Go in the back alleys like Ko\u017en\u00e1, Kamz\u00edkov\u00e1, \u0158et\u011bzov\u00e1, Zlat\u00e1, Malt\u00e9zk\u00e9 n\u00e1m., Tr\u017ei\u0161t\u011b, Nov\u00fd sv\u011bt or passages in Lucerna, Sv\u011btozor or Kotva, Slovansk\u00fd d\u016fm. If you want to enjoy this area take your time 2- 3 days the best :) visit some museums, galeries, towers and one day live for relax at some of the cafes, pubs or clubs (Imperi\u00e1l, Orient, Sl\u00e1vie, Tricafe, \u010cerven\u00e1 \u017eidle;Lok\u00e1l, V kolkovn\u011b, U zlat\u00e9ho tygra, U Dvou ko\u010dek, U chlupat\u00fdho ducha, The pub, Mincovna, Dejavu... If you are looking for local people than you looking in wrong part of Prague try try Prague 2 Vinohrady, I P Pavlova. If you don\u00b4t like crouwds, Czech republic has nicer towns like Tel\u010d, Olomouc, Kutn\u00e1 Hora, \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov..."

Prague is such a charming place, and its old town is probably the most beautiful and captivating that I've ever visited, with its black towers and the very interesting history and mixture of styles. The art hides everywhere, in every building and statue, in every square in its ancient carved stone. And in contrast with that eastern tenebrous style, there are some other gorgeous constructions and galleries of Art Noveau, with floral motives and golden details. There is much more than the clock and the bridge. The whole city seems to have a spirit, something unique, that I can hardly explain, but that deeply touched me. Warning!!! At least when I was there it was under a massive tourism, with tons of people with cameras pushing you around, horrible music from the standard touristic stores, street sellers trying to make you buy stupid made-in-China stuff..... and the ancient charm of Prague was hardly to be seen. My advice: Try to start your visit very early, walk the side streets, search that silence that will make you get in contact with the spirit of the town, read about it's history and about its art and its symbols. That's why this annoying issue doesn't make my opinion of Prague any worse."

The architecture is divine with buildings of all ages cheek by jowel with each other. the real joy - for me - is the multitude of art nouveau design places which abound and which have been lovingly maintained. The area of the Old Town Square is always very busy and you are likely to get regularly accosted by locals trying to entice you into their restaurant. Most of the major roads through the Old Town are busy with other tourists and there are plenty of shops sellling from complete tut to quality Czech glass and jewellery based on the local garnets. The best outlet by far for quality at excellent prices is Manufacktura with a number of outlets around town selling hand made toys, ceramics and toiletries. The biggest problem is the burgeoning number of Segway tours as these morons seem to think everyone should give way to them in the sometimes impossibly narrow streets. They should be banned to the benefit of all"

It gets very crowded for people to see the mechanics at the hour, but you should see it at least once. For another take on this, climb the tower and take some pictures of everyone gathering around down below during the chiming."

The best way to arrive here is to take Metro Line A (green) to Staromestska (Old Town Square) in the city center by purchasing a 24-hr transit pass for 110 crowns ($5) at any metro station machine. Old Town is located on the east bank of the Vltava River, connected to the the Lesser Quarter (Mala Strana) on the west bank by the famous Charles Bridge. Many major landmarks are located in Old Town, such as the Tyn Church (the inspiration for Disney's Sleeping Beauty Castle) and the Astronomical Clock (the oldest working clock in the world) in Old Town Square, the National Theater, and the Powder Tower (the gate to Old Town). Old Town is great for a stroll through Medieval times and enjoying the architecture as you grab a bite to eat from the street vendors and window shop at the various novelty stores, but don't buy anything since everything here is overpriced for tourists.Lodging in the city center is expensive, so find hotels in the nearby neighborhoods, such as Districts 2 or 3 to the east and south, District 7 north of the river, or District 5 to the west, then take the metro into town."

The market still retains many of the artisan stalls that have been replaced by sellers of 21st Century plastic junk elsewhere in Europe. The stallholders are friendly, with plenty of tasty foods to try, and the crowds include many people who are clearly locals, as well as the obvious tourists. But is the setting which makes the old town magical. The twin spires of the 14th century Tyn Church, the Astronomical Clock beside the Old Town Hall Tower, the bars and restaurants in historic buildings - they all combine to put Prague near the top of any must-see list.And if you have 800 Czech Koruna to spare after all that, spend it on an evening horse & carriage ride around the town. You won't regret it!"

During Christmas, the Old Town Square has a Christmas market that fills nearly the entire square, perfect for strolling and people watching."

They themselves are nothing special - just a city market but they added to the romance of the place. The cobblestone streets and interesting little lanes makes the place a pleasure to wander in.We must have been lucky in that we didn't find the crowds a problem, with the possible exception being the regular clock event"

All squirming through the crowd to get to another tourist spot in another part of the square where you can squirm some more. Sounds lovely doesn't it?

It's about 5-10 minute walk to Staromestske Namesti or the Plaza.The Old Town is full of nice places to visit. We got a Prague Card which covers any cost for transportation and most of the popular sites and attractions to be visited \u2014 if not free, they\u2019re discounted. When you purchase a Prague Card, there\u2019s a booklet that comes with it that guides you to tour around Prague and whether that attraction/site is free or discounted. It also contains maps, etc. The Prague Card can be bought in the Tourist Info Center in Old Town, it's door is a few steps from the face of the Astronomical Clock. It's on an Orange Building Fa\u00e7ade.The whole town is picturesque. It seems like it\u2019s a scene from Disney Cartoons where houses are colorful and beautiful. There are several cafe\u2019s, restaurants, and museums within the old town. Everything is adjacent to one another. Get a Map and familiarize yourself with which place or museum you want to visit so as not to tire yourself from walking on the cobble stone paths. Wear comfy shoes as usual.NOTE: Be careful on money exchange kiosks in the area, they may have a sign that says \"no commission\" but their exchange rate is really low (19 CZK to a Euro). So try to compute the lowest exchange rate you can accept for those establishments without commission. While we were there, the common exchange rate was about 26-27 CZK to a Euro but these establishments have a max 19% commission. So we computed that if we desperately needed CZKs, the lowest we can go is an exchange rate of 22 CZK to a Euro with 0% commission. With this computation, we can get roughly the same amount as that of the one with commission. So be careful and don't be hasty. Luckily, we found some forex kiosks that offer 5% commission or less with an exchange rate of about 26 CZKs to a Euro. Just be patient and you'll find one. Also, save your coins and don't get rid of them! These are useful for Toilets (WC use is often paid for in this side of town) and Gold Coin Souvenirs (50CZK) in those little machines around town. You'll see these machines on either entrances or exits of popular buildings or churches. The cheapest toilet we've seen in Old Town (that's not Free for use) is the one inside the Building of the Astronomical Clock, right beside the Elevators on the Ground Floor. It's only 3 CZK."

Christmas markets were fun but sadly the weather was quite mild and we didn't see snow which was one of the anticipated attractions. What was really disappointing is the plague of grafitti in Prague.

True, commercialization appears in every nook and cranny but if you can probably just filter out the modern springings, you can see the beauty of Prague old town, splendid. Even the modernization has added its own charm. Ensure you walk through as many winding lanes as possible, even if there are no throngs of tourists, the combination of art noveau and bohemian architecture, the cobbled streets, the feel of having stepped back in time is wonderful. Though ofcourse, the cobbled streets can leave your feet screaming. (But then, there are zillions of Thai massage parlors to help you with it). Don't forget to look up down right and left to take in the entire scene. The restaurants / cafes in the side streets are predictably less expensive than the ones in the core.

The main square is full of happy faces, has a beautifully decorated and enormous Christmas tree, and kiosks serving the best street food in Europe. A choir is on stage in the afternoons beautifully singing traditional carols. The ambience is poignant, resolutely suggesting that our Western Christmas traditions might have started here."

Quick word of caution, if you decide to grab yourself some \"Old Prague Ham\" from one of the market vendors make sure to ask for a very small portion to avoid contention, otherwise they will attempt to sell you half a kilo of ham for the equivalent of $25 (charged per 100g)! Don't be afraid to say no and move on to the next vendor if you get caught out! On the flipside the ham is absolutely delicious."

I visited the Old Town from 3rd to 6th December for its Christmas markets.The atmosphere was lively, with festivities in the air. The market was lovely too- with stalls selling hot mulled wine, honey wine, chimney cakes, chocolates, sausages and much more. In the evening, there were also choirs singing carols and kids doing plays on the stage that was set up near the huge Christmas tree. The astronomical clock is a stone's throw away. Every hour people would crowd up to see the clock's works. Right next to the clock tower is the tourist centre. It has all the brochures- state opera, breweries tour, music concerts... you can find it all out here. It has a washroom too.The people at the centre were helpful too, with the directions as well as bookings that I made to a Mozart concert at the Municipal House. I would strongly recommend to everybody to buy tickets to the top of the tower (about 110 czk koruna). The views one gets from the top are simply mind-blowing. Just like in the movies, just like in the postcards! Your camera will run out, but the photo opportunities won't!There is also a lane nearby, inside which you can find a nice place to convert your Euros to koruna without commission.There are lot of good eateries, pubs and bars nearby. Do walk from here to the Charles Bridge. The route is lined with souvenir shops. Do buy carefully after visiting at least 5-6 shops."

            "review": "Safe historic place to explore. Old Town is actually quite large in area tthat goes back to at least the 800's AD and seems to be most famous for the King Charles IV (Karel IV in Czech) who was also known as the Good King Wenceslaus about whom we sing at Christmas time. King Charles has many things in Old Town named after him, besides his statue, including the King Charles bridge. King Charles eventually became head of the Holy Roman Empire making Prague one of the most important cities in Europe. The complexity of the marriages, alliances, and deals made with other countries and with the Pope are very complicated, but King Charles seemed to be happy. His is one of the few statues you'll see where there is a smile on the statue's face. Our guide for a walking tour of Old Town Prague and the Palace across the river said there were different stories about why the statue is smiling, but basically he was a good king and was happy. One thing to note in your visit to Prague is that Czechoslovakia has only been out from under the iron fist of Russia since 1989 when they won their freedom starting with demonstrations on Freedom Square. This year marked the 25th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution on November 17th. This was an important celebration as it has only been 25 years since the Russians were in charge. The guide told us that the Russians told them that they were coming in to liberate them, but what they did was liberate everything from everybody and take it over. The results of so many years under the Russian culture so recently has left its mark on Prague. While people are generally friendly, their role model for how to operate were the Russians who may be the worst example of how to provide Customer Service in the world. While there are always plains clothes security people in large stores in the States watching for shop lifters, in Prague, in many of the stores, the \"plain clothes\" security were dressed in gray or dark suits and looked just like KGB agents probably looked when they used to watch over the population. These KGB looking security people stare at you when you come into some of the shops and sometimes follow you to see what you are doing. Since nearly everyone is dressed casually now, they look incongruently like hold-over models from how the Russians used to provide security. The point is that the farther Prague gets away from its Russian role model, the more they will likely change in the future. At one restaurant, the waiter seemed to be issuing orders in a low growly voice when he told us to go inside. It turned out he was doing us a favor because the prices were cheaper inside than outside, but it was still so different from what you see as customer service in the US and in France, Spain, and Germany. So just be aware that if your role model on how to behave were the Russian KGB and you lived under them for many years of your lifetime, then tone and body language may appear to be cold, but it seemed clear to us that the people were trying very hard to be friendly. Prague Old Town was a great place to visit and with 4 days and 3 nights, we did a lot of exploring and never had any question about safety. We felt safer walking around Old Town at night (not late at night because we need our sleep,), but it is a great place to visit."

We visited all the main sights, she gave us plenty of tips about what to do with the rest of our time and left us in a local restaurant which served superb food! She even gave us a full day itinerary suggestion (free of charge and based on our requests) for our first day on our arrival (unaccompanied) with details of Catholic Mass times, transport stops etc which meant we maximised our time and got to see things like the Wallenstein gardens and the thought-provoking limestone wall, that we probably would have missed."

It is not easy to list subjects of that old town. Therefore only in short: The National Theater, The Estates Theater, The Rudolfinum,The Powder Gate, The Municipial House,churches (for.ex. St.James), palaces (f.e.Clam-Gallas), The Carolinum, The Clementinum, The Charles Bridge, The Old Town Bridge Tower,... Architectural styles: romanesque, gothic,renaissance, baroque, rococo, neorenaissance, classical, historical, art nouveau"

It had been well recommended and I knew it would be good but it far surpassed all expectations. Both during the day and at night it was a magical place. So many little cobbled streets and squares, shops, attractions and steeped in centuries of history yet with all the modern conveniences and comforts that make it an absolute pleasure to visit. Loved all the music and street cafes on the squares and streets."

There are many historic works of art that any direction you turn to you will find some. We walked all over the place trying primarily to see the old buildings and art work, but there are lots of shops and restaurants down every street you take. One thing I did not like was that out of all the places in Europe I've visited, Prague seemed like the 'most out to get your money' city that I have been to. Everything from the exorbitant taxis to the fake money exchangers to all the street hustlers, made it less impressive than it really is. This are is so impressive that if you're not from some other impressive old European city, you have to spend some time here; just hold on to your wallet!"

Though the majority of the Old Town is preserved, the worst is to see the lack of control over the growing menace and danger of SEGWAYS and the agents driving around at high speed touting for business (usually to the young crowd who may think it is a cool lazy way to see the city)! Sad. You cannot beat walking in the historic centre if you want to enjoy the maximum and appreciate the wealth of buildings, sites and colours.  Also they have allowed the restaurants to take up more space with their tables + street performers, + guides touting for business etc.Perhaps bribes secure the freedom to publicise your business or gain more space on the square. You can only enjoy it in peace without having to avoid the segways at night when Tyn Church is mystically lit as in a fairy tale.Strange that since Starbucks managed to set up in the prime location near the clock tower the square has got more commercialised than ever!To end on a positive note, it is encouraging to see that with all today's tech distractions one of the oldest working mechanisms in the world (the Astronomical Clock) continues to attract 100s of wondrous and curious onlookers each hour!"

The Charles Bridge is located in the old town and a short walk to the Jewish quarter, so most of the tourist attractions are within walking distance, which is nice. The old town hall has information on walking tours, which I highly recommend. It also has information on any tourist attraction you want to see.

First, walk the uniquely tree-lined Parizska (\"Paris\") street, near the Jewish Quarter, and ending up in the town square. The buildings in Jewish Quarter in Prague, known as Josefov or the Prague Jewish Ghetto are part of the best preserved complex of Jewish historical monuments in Europe. Walk to the Old-New Synagogue and the Jewish Town Hall. Highly recommend going inside of the Spanish Synagogue and visiting the Old Jewish Cemetery, with jagged tombstones jutting upward in such a crowded plot. Of course, we had to join the many tourists to watch the Old Town\u2019s Astronomical Clock, built in 1410 and once the envy of all of Europe. Also recommend that you head down Old Town's winding lanes, which were carved out long before cities had rectilinear street grids (a big part of the city's charm). Naturally one must make the obligatory \u201cStroll Across Charles Bridge, the 600-year-old crown jewel of Czech heritage. IF you return to the square, consider stopping at the Klementinum and other small churches (which we also found quite nice)"

It is no accident that Nezval compares the towers in the clear night air to a 'gathering of magicians' The Prague sky recovers from these pinnacle pricks by resting its cheeks on the soft cupolas of the Baroque age, though their marshy emerald conceals an admixture of witchcraft: according to Seifert you can hear the croaking of frogs in the verdigris when the moon rises.\" (Angelo Maria Ripellino, Magic Prague)We spent a week in Prague, staying in an apartment overlooking the Franti\u0161k\u00e1nsk\u00e1 Zahrada (Franciscan Garden), close to the Starom\u011bstsk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed (old town square). The city of the Vltava is, simply, magical - especially at the golden hour, as the sun is going down. Dominated by the Gothic T\u00fdnsk\u00fd Chr\u00e1m (Tyn Church) and the famous, medieval Orloj (the astronomical clock), the Starom\u011bstsk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed has been Prague\u2019s main market place for more than 1,000 years.A labyrinth of narrow, cobbled streets radiate from the square, where - along with the throng of your fellow tourists - you can get lost in the sheer beauty and almost palpable history of the place. After a day exploring the Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto, jump on a bus up to the Letn\u00e1 beer garden for unrivalled views over the town, with its tangle of red roofs and those sky-piercing spires."

After reading various guide books and internet postings by earlier visitors, I decided to go with the popular recommendation of booking a private guide for walking tours. As we were only at the start of a three week long trip, we decided to take it easy and opted for tours lasting 3 hours each day and used the service for two days. I booked this through Personal Prague Guide. We also booked a car to meet us at the airport when we arrived and the same driver picked us up for our departure flight was very early, at 0530. PPGuide arranged all that and it made life really easy.I was very impressed by their prompt replies and flexibility in tailoring the walks to our requirement. Our guide, Alzbeta was knowledgeable and was able to answer all the questions we threw at her."

Retains old world charm with its cobbled streets and older model trams creeping under arches and only just clearing them. When you go up to the Castle, (keep in mind that this is quite a steep climb, something to consider if your mobility is impaired or you have someone in the group whose mobility in impaired) look out for stunning views of the city from several angles. After walking past the Castle (if your lucky you may witness a changing of the Guard( ensure you walk past to St Vitus Cathedral and see the spires from which the darkened Gargoyles peer. The Gothic Architecture with large Gargoyles who have water spouts in their mouths is truly something to behold. This Cathedral is honestly larger than life and you can feel the age and gravitas surrounding it. Most people turn back here but if you proceed further you will come to Golden lane, where on a small corner you find miniscule houses with doors which are dwarf sized. It is said that Kafka lived in one of these houses, although I find it difficult to believe that he wrote such dark pieces living in this beautiful area! The little souvenir shops on the road leading up to the castle are worth a visit. The paintings and the ceramic replicas of the little cottages of Golden Lane were my favouriteSADLY our Prage experience was ruined by what happened on the Tram on our way to Infant Jesus church for Sunday mass. We had bought 4 tickets (with continuous serial numbers which proves all four were bought together) While stamping it for time one ticket had not got the stamp printed on it. Upon getting down at the church we were pounced upon by two persons who were dressed quite shabbily and told us they were ticket inspectors. As we were advised that there were fraudsters in Prague who prey on tourists we were very weary and wanted to meet the Police. They agreed to call the Police but kept threatening us saying that the fine will then be more whilst making a public scene in a crowded area. We were extremely upset and humiliated and our whole trip to Europe and in particular Prague was totally ruined. Some people in the area did say that these inspectors travel incognito. We then tried to speak to them and tell them that we were tourist who had purchased four tickets as demonstrated by the continous serial numbers, and if the print out didnt happen it was not our fault. Also that we had come to mass to church and were leaving onward to Munich so had no local currency left. However these two so called inspectors were extremely rude and aggressive acting in callous disregard of what we were saying. We finally gave in and paid the \"fine\" but the magic of Prague was lost. Great shame, make sure this doesnt happen to you"

Yes is can be packed with tourists through the summer months but there is a good reason for that. Along with Paris and Venice, it is a must see city!"

Very easy to get lost as the streets don't run to a grid, open out into plazas at every turn & some are extremely short, running in between & some not particularly noticeable at all! Main tourist areas are continually packed with large tour groups except perhaps on a Sunday evening. Walking is not something you can do with your brain in neutral or you'll get run down or trip over something as the areas are very uneven. You can almost get overload there is so much to see & will certainly get neck ache looking up at all the spectacular architecture. Traffic moves quite quickly even on tiny back lanes with parking allowed along most roads so there is a need to stay vigilant even when caught up in the whole sightseeing thing."

I suggest there should be a permit process and a limit to the number of shops that sell kitschy stuff. Kitsch must be a Czech word. And the hawking and renting of Segways to anyone was annoying and disconcerting when pilotted by the novice near you. However a little extra walking and you can get away from all that and enjoy what Prague residents enjoy."

The historical features, such as the famous clock, and the ever-resonating events that these areas have been witness to over the centuries ( finestrations in Staromestke Nam. and the most recent revolution that brought democracy to the Czechs starting with a student march in Vaclavske Nam.) lend a dramatic air to this old city center."

It is great if you don't buy anything because things are expensive in the old town, even in the fast food places. I would suggest that you walk around and window shop but eat before or after you walk around the Old Town to save a few bucks. You must go into the town center and take a photo of tyn church, which is synonymous with Prague and watch the astronomical clock, even though it was a disappointment when we saw it at the top of the hour. The energy from all of the people in the square was just electrofying. There are also quite a number of tourists on the segway tours so be careful."

Having been to Prague in the winter last time we went, there is a big difference around the square, it is very packed in the summer months and it was filled with segways trying to get through the crowds; this was very impractical as the segway tour people offered the hire of these things but I really dont know what benefit people who rented them got from trying to whizz in and out of crowds; in fact one lady ran into the back of my leg as she couldnt drive it properly!!! For me this spoilt the square; they are not needed to get around."

Went here at the end of a 10 day central European vacation, was my least favorite thing in Prague, I loved the rest of the city but old town was an awful experience. Even though it was off-season (September) the place was packed, pretty much standing room only. Everything was crazy expensive ($8 coffees and beers) and everybody was very rude. Went to a money changer that ripped me off, we were later informed by a local that all the old town shops are run by the Russian mob. We went 2 blocks over and sat and had lunch and watched 3 guys trying to chase down somebody who stole a girls purse.Overall the least desirable place I have ever visited."

Prague is like a beautiful bride, tall, bellisimo, perfect body but dressed by sex workers in a Bangkok brothel on pat pong street. This is a city of ten thousand souvenirs shops. In 2014, this city reeks of huge tour groups, beggars, homeless people and every inch of land available occupied by cheap trinkets and souvenir shops. If I did not know the average income of Czech people, I would have mistaken their lack of civility to smile due to Botox injections they have taken. English is very much non existent and not understood on the street and caf\u00e9s. Money grab for use of bathrooms is not only shameful but down right in human. At the Monastery, after paying for my wife and son to go to the rest room, I turned around to find a 70 year old Italian women being harassed by the rest room attendant because she did not have 10 KC (50 cents us). I handed 10 KC to the attendant to let the elderly women pass and go to the restroom. If you have been to any of other places like Paris, Vienna, or Budapest.....Prague will be a waste of time. Even though it is beautiful , the mayor of the city looks like has moved to some other city and left this place open for grabs to anyone who wants to hawk cheap trinkets."

To me, it really felt like being at Disney---thick crowds and beautiful buiildings. There are (overpriced) restaurants, plenty of gelato stands, Souvenir stores, and historical sights to see. You'll want to make sure and go up in the Astronomical Clock, the view is awesome! Just ask the ticket taker how long the line (queue) is right then, and maybe go back in the afternoon for a shorter line. Hotel U is great; go up in the rooftop terrace if possible. There are lots of street performers here...yay! This place is PACKED OUT but there's a reason for it!"

We didn't go on a bar crawl, but if there's anyone I don't want to go on a bar crawl with, it's some guy who comes racing up to you on his little Segway making other people dodge him on the way.It was also quite hard to explore because of all the crowds and you can't find a proper seat to relax except in bars, but it is definitely worth visiting - you could probably spend a whole day in the square and its surrounding streets."

It was separated from the outside by a semi-circular moat and wall, connected to the Vltava at both of its ends. The moat is now covered up by the streets (from north to south-west) Revolu\u010dni, Na P\u0159\u00edkop\u011b, and N\u00e1rodni\u2014which remain the official boundary of the cadastral district of Old Town. It is now in Praha 1.Soon after the city was expanded in the 14th century by Charles IV with the founding of the New Town, the moat and wall were dismantled.Notable places in the Old Town include the Old New Synagogue, Old Town Square and Astronomical Clock. Across the river Vltava connected by the Charles Bridge is Mal\u00e1 Strana (\"Lesser Quarter\"). Josefov is located in the northwest corner of Old Town heading towards the Vltava."

It really is a beautiful place, the architecture of the surrounding buildings and the clock are all brilliant. However, it is so busy! The first time we went, you couldn't get to the front of the clock, but had to stand quite far back because of the many tour groups hanging around. Even at night, it was very busy, especially in the surrounding streets. If you can put up with pushing and shoving, which you should, then you will be rewarded with brilliant architecture, lovely restaurants and art galleries. Speaking of which, there was a brilliant Tim Burton exhibition at one of the Old Town's galleries."

Visiting Old Town is a must, as that is the only way to see the Old Town Hall, the Astronomical Clock, as well as churches and other structures, dating back to the 13th century. That being said, Old Town has become more like Times Square with the tourists, souvenir shops, cafes, and street performers, than a historical site. The historical beauty is somewhat lost to these elements, so you need to look beyond and see what it looked like centuries ago. I might be kidding about the amusement ride, but you never know as money makes the world go round."

On two occasions, just after concluding our withdrawal and turning to walk from the ATM a man was standing in our path holding a roll of money. He then asked if we could make change. We did not, but learned that if you agree, the thief then quickly counts from his roll of money the equivalent of what you hand him.

I knew that Prague would be difficult due to the cobbles, but what I really struggled with was that roads and paths are just not maintained well enough. Cobbles were missing everywhere meaning that there were holes to weave around, and this was in the newer area where the 'cobbles' were 5x5cm stone blocks placed in a decorative pattern not the big cobbles that we found in Old Town. We rarely found a dropped curb and if we did, there might not have been one on the other side, so we weaved our way through the beautiful city of Prague in the rain."

Such a perfect mixture!Perhaps the most important attraction there is the Astronomical Clock. From the tower you can see the bird view of Prague.If you need touristy information, you can find it easily there as there is such information center. You can ask things even suggestions and you will get clear answers.All I would say is that you should experience it yourself then you can feel the nice feeling of the atmosphere of the Old Town of Prague."

You are also able to climb the clock tower if you have the stamina and want to see a breathtaking overview of Old Town. Know that the area surrounding the clock will be very crowded with tourist groups but the show is worth it, especially if you read about the history of the clock and it's construction beforehand. Also impressive, in a foreboding way, is the Black Tower and although old town is made up of narrow cobblestone streets, they are relatively easy to navigate and the layout of the area is very straight forward so it's easy to find your way."

Statuary on almost every building, not to mention the churches, cathedrals, and the Old Town Hall with the beautiful clock and the on-the-hour rotation of the saints popping out of the windows and the skeleton ringing the bell. Lots of restaurants with plenty of variety for every taste. We preferred the sidewalk cafes for the people watching. We were there in early June, so evenings were cool and Prague wasn't as full of tourists as later in the summer. Lots of shops selling tourist souvenirs but also some nice shops with good quality leather products and garnet jewelry. Take your time and walk slowly enough to take it all in. Better yet, depart from the main streets and wander through the back streets and alleyways. That's where we found the best restaurants!"

The astronomical clock which is absolutely beautiful is why you visit the old town. It is a gem. Have a coffee, have some traditional Czech food and just soak up the atmosphere. There are many restaurants, a little food market and shops surrounded by the beautiful buildings. Look around as you can find free tours that explain the history of the old town square. I had a book as I prefer to do it at my own pace. The old town square literally is something out of a fairytale. The Tyn church in particular is Disney-esque-it is even said that Walt Disney got the inspiration for the Magic Castle from the Old Town Square. It is an absolutely beautiful place, unique in the whole of Europe."

You can't help but be stunned by the beauty of the old world structures around you. As another reviewer said, you truly are looking up at the beautiful architecture and not even paying attention to anything that is at eye level. I was separated numerous times from our guide because I was too busy looking up and taking pictures. Walt Disney's castles and fantasy villages must have been partly inspired by the charm and beauty of Old Town. There's something magical about this place. You feel it all around you. It can get very crowded, and you do have to watch where you're going at times. People will stop in front you because they are also taking pictures and admiring the beauty all around them. There are so many attractions to see, and not enough time to do it all in one day. We booked a private day tour from Vienna. It was a great experience, but we should have stayed there another day. That was probably our only regret. If you can, stay in the city for a couple of days for an even better experience."

If you don't like places that cater for mass tourism, selling horrible gifts, pushy waiters and drunk people then avoid the main tourist sights after lunchtime and in the evening particularly at the weekend. Avoid eating near the main squares you will find much better quality service if you keep walking through the windy streets away from the crowds. The old town is 600/700 years old and fascinating, there are magnificent churches tucked away in the side streets, go to the Old Town Square in the morning if you don't like crowds. You will admire the Baroque and Gothic buildings and the fantastic astronomical clock -arrive for this on the hour."

You'll be forgiven if you miss a lot of what's at street level because most of the time you'll be walking around with your head bent backwards, looking up at all the fabulous buildings.

An American chap we were walking with commented that those who built the old town must have visited Disneyland, the towers, turrets and buildings being so picture perfect and replicating Disney so accurately. A joke of course (I hope) but clearly Walt had to have a template to create his fairy tale world and old Prague must have been it. The architecture and history here are fascinating. For those who want to shop, this is the place. Be aware though, that the Bohemian glass available throughout the old town, is genuine if Bohemia is somewhere in China. Of the old town area, the most interesting is around the old square but there are places in the old Jewish Quarter worth visiting such as the Pinkus synagogue. The Charles Bridge is a must. For eating and drinking purposes, as usual, steer clear of the square, prices are highly inflated for the tourists, nothing unusual in any city but avoidable if you want. There are some excellent international restaurants in the area if the heavy Czech cuisine is not to your liking. The old town is pedestrian so the trams don't access it but rather travel around it. They are still useful to get to the outside of the old town. Be aware that the tram stations to the castle are a haven for pickpockets working in teams. Nevertheless, this has to be one of the most beautiful and quaint places anywhere in Europe. We loved it."

Great stores, many museums for every taste (Tim Burton exhibition on one corner, the torture museum at the other and then you mustn't forget about all the churches), good food (value for money) and the only thing overpriced are the soft drinks in bottles (50 crowns for a 5dl-bottle).

Definitely follow the crowds through the streets and take in the various churches, the astronomic clock, Charles Bridge, Prague Castle, and all the beautiful buildings. Just make sure you use one of the elevated vantage points at some point to really appreciate the view, and get a sense of how Prague and its districts are laid out. The Old Town Hall is a great place for this, just be patient as long queues are common. Alternatively, you can enjoy a similar feel and experience architecture of the same era - minus the crowds - in Bratislava, Slovakia. If you prefer a more manageable sized area and a less touristy feel then head south. I personally feel both are worth seeing at least once, and hopefully you have the opportunity to do so on a nice, clear day. :)"

For those of you who visit the old town for the first time, you would probably find it magnificent, absolutely gorgeous; nevertheless, it would be a big disappointment for those who had visited Prague before. The old town feels like a big shopping mall where the buildings have lost their historical meaning and they are just part of the scenery to lure tourist to buy things. It wouldn't be that bad if at least these things are high quality items difficult to find elsewhere; unfortunately, this is not the case. There are gazillions of souvenir shops with very distasteful items; overpriced bad food and the usual brands that you will find in every corner of the world. I believe that some things are sacred, and at least the old town square should remain free of this stuff. Part of the magic of Prague is that it should make you feel that you travel back in time; it is difficult to accomplish this when all you see is present day mass produced garbage. Despite all of this, the old town is still beautiful."

You'll no doubt find stuff to do in the square whether it's a gallery viewing, a segway tour or just a standard walking tour. There is a wide selection of restaurants in the Old Town but I'd recommend going somewhere that isn't on one of the busy tourist streets (I loved Mlejnice, for example). The Old Town can get very busy, especially at the weekends. I would recommend, if you can, to incorporate a weekday into a city break in Prague as the crowds are less overwhelming than on a Friday night through to Sunday.

There are endless restaurants, coffee shops and a few quite good jazz clubs there too. You will not be bored! But be careful with pick pockets and sometimes not honest waiters in restaurants. It is always good to study carefully your bill and ask your waiter in calm, but very strict way, if 2+2 isn't 4.Old Town by night is beautiful too, so be prepared to walk around enjoying the view and mysterious lights the whole night. Prague's guides organize ghost tours, so may be you can meet one kind friendly ghost and tell your friends about. Don't miss it!P.S. I enclose a complete guide to Prague's restaurants.

The noisy crowds of tourists and young people meant that the old town square was near unbearable. There were so many people on the Charles bridge we had to elbow our way through. The city is still one of the most beautiful in Europe but is being ruined by too much tourism. We remember it from years ago and were shocked by the commercial changes. The main churches were all closed on Palm Sunday, even the cathedral so we could not see the famous Mucha windows we had admired long ago. Those who have happy memories of the Prague of 15 years ago should pause to consider whether they want to ruin the memory of how it used to be. Both Prague and Dubrovnik have become like Disneyland. If you want to go still go midweek in winter."

Some really good bars and restaurants around the square to sit and enjoy the view from. The buildings are really nice to admire and you should definitely just spend 1 whole day roaming around the square having lunch / dinner / drinks and take it all in at different stages of the day/night. Its best to visit really early in the morning on a weekday (5am/6am) as its pretty much deserted. So if you`re having a late one somewhere in town or are an early riser then have a stroll through here as its swarming with people after 9am until late into the night."

It's possible to have a world heritage, jaw-droppingly handsome town without turning it into Disneyland. Rothenburg ob der Tauber and Edinburgh are two examples - but virtually every shop in Prague old town either sells tat to the vast crowds of tourists or displays expensive brands which those tourists presumably aspire to. Yes, I am a tourist too, but not one who would ever return to Prague, which I consider utterly spoiled. It isn't a real place. There are no shops for the locals and most people you meet seem intent on separating you from your money. I think that if you want to see it done properly, head for Gdansk or Stralsund."

When I first visited Prague 35 years ago I was struck by the fact that there was no litter and thought that this time there would be but NO.......everywhere is kept very clean.Some of the buildings are 700 years old and it was wonderful to soak up the atmosphere of the square where all those years ago the merchants and tradespeople came to sell their wares. This square was a meeting place for people coming from all over Europe and today it is the same....many different languages could be heard.The square is very large and in the sunshine folk sat around listening to the jazz groups and the singers while the children chased the giant bubbles from the street vendors.Surrounding the square are many cafe/bars providing coffees, teas alcoholic drinks and Czech food and one must take advantage of a few hours in the square before leaving Prague. We enjoyed the Czech beer and Tiramasu.....but it is more expensive to eat in these restaurants. the ice cream is to die for!Paryska Street has changed tremendously and is now the street of high fashion and designers such as Gucci, Prada, Dior etc but I was much happier discovering the little shops found in out of the way little streets"

The astronomical clock is located here and all the Christmas markets filled the square (January) it was almost weird once they had gone as it made the square feel rather empty. With the town hall tower to take in the views and the church of our lady before tyn also located here its got plenty to keep you busy. The architecture is enough to take your breath away.

Places like old town square and Charles Bridge must be a nightmare in the height of summer. So if there is anything useful I can inform as a result of staying here it would be...Research the public transport system before you get there. At first it seems a bit inconvenient and off-the-wall but once you understand it, it is straight forward. The only negative I would say is that ticket machines here don't have paper note or credit/debit card facilities so if you don't have the correct change you are forced to buy tickets from a vendor. If travelling late at night this can be problematic. Also make sure you have a valid ticket if making your way from the airport to Prague, if you get swept up in the flow of travellers and are without a ticket (which is very easy to do) you may find yourself being fined about \u00a325. A ticket will cost you approximately \u00a31. Travelling to places outside of Prague under your own steam is not for everyone. You have to be fairly inquisitive and tenacious to get anywhere (if you don't speak the language that is). We travelled to Kutna Hora by booking our own train tickets, which was easy, but we did have to endure some long waiting times due to my lack of understanding of their timetables.We also travelled by bus to about an hour outside Prague to a place called Lidice. The hardest part of this journey was locating the correct bust stop! But it did only cost 110CKr to visit this most emotive of places.I read a few times that the meals in the old town square were quite expensive, well in my short experience here I found that the open-air (canopy covered) areas were more expensive, but still quite reasonable compared to UK prices. Restaurants in the side streets seemed very reasonable to me. Of our four nights in the old town, we ate very well indeed, including a couple of drinks and second course for less than \u00a310 per head.There are plenty of museums in Prague but I think the real attraction is Prague itself. The architecture and history behind it is fascinating and you are hard pushed to find a building that is unclean or in need of repair. There is little litter about and quite a high police presence keeping order, I think mainly keeping the many vagrants from causing unease among the visitors.The local authorities also do an excellent job illuminating the many buildings at night making them even more beautiful and magical then they already are. Finally, a vegetarian may find Prague a little irritating as most restaurants supply a feast of meats and dumplings on your plate as standard. I'm sure if I were to live there I would double in weight! Pork, beef and duck are on just about every menu. Speaking of food... Lunchtimes are great too. Goulash served in a bread bowl, which you can also eat afterwards is amazing value for money. You will not go hungry in Prague.I haven't seen it in summer but I can thoroughly recommend it as a winter destination."

The architecture and history of the city seems to be neverending. Simply cannot describe the scene with words. The Old Town Sqaure is a must see attraction and you have to try the local foods and beers. However, on another note, I am hoping this review can save at least one innocent tourist from getting hussled for their Euros. Here are my two experiences that I have to share:Firstly, there are numerous exchange houses all over the city, but PAY ATTENTION TO THE COMMISSIONS and TRANSACTION FEES at these exchanges. The exchange houses display big posters which read \"0% COMMISSIONS\" but BEWARE!!! They cleverly hide the TRANSACTION FEES - which turned out to be over 20%!!!!!! Two of the guys in my group exchanged 100 Euros and only got back about 1,900 Korunas. The market exchange was 27.50 Korunas per Euro and we were given only about 19 korunas per euro!!!!! When you get back a large wad of cash at a legitimate exchange, you don't think they're ripping you off and you just pocket the cash without thinking twice, but BELIEVE ME THEY ARE RIPPING YOU OFF!! They won't tell you what exchange rate they are giving you unless you ask. They just tell you how many korunas you're getting. Don't be fooled people! We finally found an exchange that gave us 26.80 korunas per euro WITHOUT ANY EXTRA FEES - so don't settle for shady exchanges, there are good ones out there.Secondly, don't get scammed by one of the many street husslers who prowl the popular tourist areas. Under no circumstances whatsoever, DO NOT EXCHANGE YOUR MONEY WITH SOMEONE FROM THE STREET!! On our second day (we were a group of 5 people), as we were walking towards the old town square, a middle aged, middle eastern man approched us and asked us if we would like to exchange some Euros for Czech Korunas and he said he could give us a good rate. He was very warm and welcoming and seemed pleasant to deal with and offered us 30 Korunas for 1 Euro (the market rate was approximately 27.50 Korunas for 1 Euro). One of the guys in our group thought the exchange rate was good so 3 guys exchanged approximately 250 Euros and got some Korunas back at the rate of 30 per Euro. Not bad... and I jokingly said that the deal sounds like a good deal, unless the bills turned out to be fake. However the bills were not fake at all! In fact, they were real. But, there was a problem when we tried to pay for our bus tour. The lady at the counter told us they only accept kounas or euros and she didn't know what currency we were holding!!! The bills we had did not actually say anything in English letters. It was all in Russian. I googled the bill and found out the bills we exchanged were real indeed, however the pleasant man gave us Belarusian Rubles!!!! Exchange rate being 13,200 Rubles per Euro - meaning we were stuck with worthless paper. Nice...All in all, Prague was a great experience, but I had to share my story because it really made me mad!"

You will visit the main square with the astronomical clock - be there a few minutes BEFORE the hour to see the display of the Apostles and the figures of Death, Vanity, Greed and the Turk. I recommend being there 5 minutes BEFORE the hour as twice we missed the display arriving on the hour. Also visit the Church of Our Lady of Tyn and the courtyard behind. You can climb the old Town Hall tower for views, but we chose to climb the tower of St. Vitus' cathedral instead.There is a beautiful portal c1590 at the House at the Two Golden Bears (Melantrichova Street, which leads off the Old Town Square almost opposite the Astonomical Clock).For a relaxing view of the Old Town Square have a drink in the cafe of the Grand Hotel Praha if you can get a window seat; we ate there one evening, had the steak and it was awful, so do not recommend having a meal there.But best of all, if you like Art Nouveau, do not miss the Municipal Buidling beside the Powder Gate. Go inside and have a drink / eat in one of the numerous cafes/ restaurants and do nose around, especially downstairs. The decorations are amazing, especially the light fittings in the ground floor cafe. Next time I go I will definitely book to go to one of the performances so I can see the Smetana Hall, although there are guided tours (twice a day in the winter, the first being at 1pm)."

Old structure are spread over and no body would deny that they are pretty. This area is touristy, then just blended your self as one of it, you will feel the vibrant of the city atmosphere. Use your comfortable shoes when scroll over the old town. There are many restaurant and cafe around, for some break with a glass if wine and light snack or for your lunch and dinner. Our experience teach us to re check the bill before pay. We found some of waitress are tricky, they put others bill on us. We have a bad experienced twice with the cafe around this square. One they put the tips at whatever value they want to have and in the 2nd cafe, they put others order to our bill. I don't think this accidentally. Just be aware of that. Another thing, be aware of pick pocket as this area so crowded especially in the bright sunny day. Unfortunately, these things quite a bit reducing the beauty of this city. However, don't stuck on that. Still enjoying the time walk around the old square, watching some attractions in the square and buying a souvenir for our love one at home, etc. Don't miss to climb the astronomical clock tower in the corner of old square to let yourself viewing the 360 degree of Prague. As a tourist, of course, its a must to come to this place with a camera for some nice memory bringing to home."

This is the third time we have been for new years eve and every time it gets better.May i suggest doing all the tourist things,but also just walk and go off the beaten track and get lost you will then find the locals bars and eat the locals food. New years Eve itself is brilliant a complete madness of fireworks let of in the streets,but be prepared and take very warm clothes."

It is just fantastic to walk on narrow stoned streets and is a calming (or sometimes tiring!) expereince in itself. While in the old town, try souvenier shopping for Bohemian crystal glasses in Blue Praha or Erpet or any of the local small tourist shops but do bargain in the smaller stores.Try the Gluhwine and local delicacies from the local street vendors as they are really good in taste.However, just be careful with your wallets and belongings.Great place though!"

Narrow winding streets (that you'll for sure get lost in), a stunning array of different architecture and buildings, and lots of great reasonably priced restaurants and bars. What's not to like about Prague's beautiful Old Town?!This is an area to stroll through, and to happily get lost in for an hour or two, and just to soak up the atmosphere.A bonus in the month prior to Christmas are the Christmas Markets in the Old Town Square (qv). Be sure to eat a Trldno (spelling?) pastry cone, and some of the Old Prague roast ham."

Unspoilt by war (in the last century or so at least) this district is chic full of well-maintained 19th century architecture, often reminiscent of parts of Paris. While there are notable museums and other attractions easily visited in Prague (enough for a 3-4 day trip), just wandering around the Stare Mesto is worthwhile in itself, dipping in and out of cafes, bars and shops and soaking up the atmosphere."

And the entertainment on the square: do you go to the food stands first or watch the various performers trying to make a go of things in the square? Seeing the Old Town Square at night was dazzling, even better than day time. And how could you miss \"The Show\" at the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Hall? A little hokey I thought and I avoided it for as long as a could. it is a reconstruction of a clock that was installed here in the 1400s and must have been a marvel of its time. Don't blink!

No need to go to pricey restaurants, as there were several food stalls, but beware of the vendors selling pieces of ham off the rotisserie.

With its size and many paths, there's something for everyone such as: cafes, restaurants, stores, food vendors, photo ops etc. It's also an ideal place to just walk around as a tourist and see what tickles your fancy as it is connected to quite a few of the other tourist attractions. Some of the winding lanes/streets may get confusing after a while, but the most important thing is you're getting 'lost' in a controlled environment where there's still a lot of tourists and shops around (as opposed to accidentally walking into a deserted dark alley and it's too late).I strongly recommend having a cup of coffee with a friend in one of the many cafes/restaurants by the side of the road. It'll give you the opportunity to people watch, soak up the energy, and enjoy the architecture all at the same time."

The only minus would be the restaurants in touristy areas where one has to watch out for add-ons to the tab such as 'couvert', offerings of bread and butter which they then charge you for. In quite a few caf\u00e9s and restaurants I noticed that the 'smallest' beer is often not the cheapest! Traditional restaurants seem to offer meat, meat and meat with very few vegetarian options (fried cheese and pasta). Luckily, we discovered there are many Asian restaurants where it is easy to eat vegetarian.Public transport is cheap although it is very easy to walk everywhere in the city centre."

I never tired of it and whatever I did in my 3 day visit I always ended up in the Old Town Square. The Astronomical clock draws large crowds particularly just before the hour chimes. There are street entertainers dotted around the square, bands, artists etc and it is the focal point of the city. It seems to be busy day and night. During the day there are street vendors cooking and selling the most delicious food. You can take a horse and carriage ride. You can join a segway tour, and a lot of the guided tours start out at the square in the morning, as do the ghost tours in the evening. The square is surrounded by hotels and bars with outdoor seating areas. They are geared up for the cold weather with covered seating areas and perspex sides and they have patio heaters to keep you warm and blankets to keep the chill off your legs. Try the delicious hot wine laced with cinnamon. It has to be said however the prices to eat and drink in the bars around the square are quite pricey. But it has to be worth paying a premium price to soak up the atmosphere of the place. Typically a beer will cost you around 200 czech crowns. A coffee will be very similar. There are a couple of places that offer cake and wine for 150 czech crowns. The nice thing about Prague is that nothing is very far, with the exception of the castle. From the Old Town Square you can walk to the Charles Bridge, about 5 minutes, Wenceslas Square is less than 10 minutes away. The Jewish Quarter is less than 5 minutes. You must go to the top of the clock tower as the views are spectacular. There are lifts to take you to the top, it is a very long way if you walk up!"

The sounds and smells provide a boost to the senses that the eyes can behold whilst also taking in the buildings which contain so much history. You will pass through the Square everyday and will always see, hear and smell something different.While you are there take a trip to the top of the astronomical clock tower which provides stunning views of Prague and the surrounding areas."

Thanks to Hitler just taking over the Czech Republic and them surrendering without a fight, the beautiful city of Prague was spared from bombs. Hardly anything was destroyed, making this one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. Seriously, it beats even Paris."

Nice little museum, and a great restaurant back of the church (not the little snack area in front) where we sat under the trees and enjoyed grilled salmon and salad. Yum. Walked all along the walls. Absolutely fantastic."

The Tyn church steeples, the large open square and Astronomical Clock make for a must-see when visiting Prague. But during our July visit it was extremely crowded with clock watchers, more crowded than the Charles Bridge at mid day. The swarms of tourists packed shoulder to shoulder made us just want to leave after the clock struck 12! But we were at the mercy of those around us to start thinning out. Not to discourage anyone, just be aware it isn't a spot for quiet or romance when the clock strikes."

Old Town Square is the first call for 99% of tourists and even your bored teen kids won't be disappointed as you stand looking up at the awe inspiring Gothic splendour. Make sure you are there as the hour strikes to see the incredible Prague Astronomical Clock - built in 1410 - on the Old Town Hall. You will be astonished to see actual animatronic figures appear! Your bored teens - raised on 3D video games - maybe slightly less 'whelmed' than you, but do explain the clock was built 600 years ago (before Nintendo existed) and before they slope off to Starbucks - less than 50 metres away across Old Town Square - do attempt to regale them with the legend of the master clock maker, Master Hanu\u0161 who created a wonder of its day:Back in 1410 the City Councillors were so thrilled with their astonishing astronomical clock that, in an act of somewhat disturbing gratitude towards its creator, decided to poke his eyes out, rendering the perplexed and, I imagine, startled Master Hanu\u0161 completely blind. Their reason was fear that Hanu\u0161 would build an even better clock for another European city. Not overly pleased with his newly acquired 'visually challenged' status - Hanu\u0161 was led, under cover of darkness, by a friend to the clock, where he removed a secret brick. Reaching inside he disabled the clock mechanism for the next 500 years... Your bored teen kids may now mutter the word, 'cool' or 'whatever', before heading off for a much needed Starbucks Macchiato. The more prosaic reality of the clock story is that it was built by Mikulas of Kadan (in 1410) assisted by astronomer and Charles University professor, Jan Sindel. The clock never really worked that successfully and eventually ground to a halt for several centuries. In 1865 it was restored and given a new mechanism and has worked ever since. Some of the animatronic figures on the clock were damaged by the German army in the second world war and have been replaced.  Astronomical Clock ticked-off the 'to do' list, it maybe time to get something to eat: I'm not a big fan of any of the restaurants on Old Town Square, as the owners don't need repeat business and food is distinctly average and over-priced. The restaurants want to feed you and free the table for their next customer as fast as possible. I suggest heading to smaller restaurants up one of the many side streets, and if you see Czech people eating in there it's probably good!"

Then we took the train to Salzburg where we spent 3 days - also lovely place where we enjoyed our stay and loved the tours we took there in spite of the rain. They were tours of the Lake and Mountains and the Sound of Music tour - both very scenic. We took a day tour to Budapest - another beautiful place- and we were happy to have taken the tour although we would have needed at least 3 days to get a better idea of Budapest. But it was worth it. Then we headed for Prague where we spent 3 days. PRAGUE IS SO SO SO BEAUTIFUL. It was our favorite place, so well preserved. It has not been very affected by the war and is a real gem! Compared to Vienna which is beautiful, we felt that Prague had the edge - we fell in love with it. There is so much to see there! The one thing we regret having taken was a dinner cruise - a complete waste of time and money. Otherwise, our other regret was to not have stayed longer in Prague. We also noted that the people are very friendly and friendlier that the Viennese. We stayed at \"Ma Maison\" hotel which we recommend (well located, with a fantastic view if you can get a corner room on the higher floors). We then left Prague to go back to Vienna, but on our way we stopped for one night at a little medieval town called Cesky Krumlov (also in the Czech Republic). Cesky Krumlov is such a beautiful place!!! All worth the stop there. So, the highlight of our trip was our stay in Prague! We will probably go back to Prague a must see, so beautiful!"

Follow the lnarrow little street at the side of Starbucks coffee house, and eventually you will reach the market with the most amazing fruit and vegetables, beautifully presented, reasonably priced, huge in size, and delicious to taste!

The architecture is beautiful (most of Prague is but it's concentrated here,) and the \"Adam & Eve\" cathedral (you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it) is one of the prettiest buildings I've ever seen, especially at night. The town square is a great place with great atmosphere. Full of tourists, yes, but it has a better vibe than most cities' main square I've noticed. More fun and relaxed. The old town area is nice, the streets are charming with old cobblestone and a medieval feel, and very confusing to navigate! There are some great little places hidden around here, some nice cheap little local spots, and just as many or more overpriced tourist traps. Try asking a local where to go.The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star is because of the general overpriced-ness of the area and the tourist traps, but that's to be expected in any city's main square.Again, there are plenty of nice little places you'd never expect to find, you just have to find them! Or of course, ask someone that lives around here.At night, do expect to be asked if you want drugs or to go to a strip club or disco, but that's expected as well. The touts and dealers aren't pushy though, and it's far from dangerous. Just a polite \"no thanks\" (or even better, \"ne d\u00edky\") will get them off your back immediately. Don't feel threatened here, Prague is a safe city.I've been here for four months or so total and still come back to Old Town a few times per week."

It does get very very busy at the weekends and during the day! I came here early in the morning and at midnight and it was beautiful. I also came at peak tourist time and it was rammed with people all waiting for the astronomical clock. There are lots of restaurants all providing views of the square. Ofcourse they are over priced but then you get to enjoy this atmosphere. And to be honest, everywhere in Prague near the tourists sites are overpriced. I had a hot chocolate with rum here in one of the restaurants and paid around 140 czk for this...which I think was worth it for the scenery and my own personal enjoyment.The clock...oh jeez everyone goes on about it! I actually really liked it! Its low key, its fun, its a beautiful clock and I probably saw it about 3 times on the hour...just don't expect much and you won't be dissappointed. Beware the Prague Ham Scam!!! There are certain wooden street stalls around the square and Old Town selling 'traditional street food' at extortionate rip off prices. I saw numerous tourists being charged 40 euros plus in czech currency for a plate of fatty ham and a bowl of potatoes. The prices listed seem reasonable initially but they are per 100g. You end up paying 20 euros jus for a bowl of potoatoes. It nearly happened to us, however, I refused to pay as the price did not seem right. However, numerous tourists looked very confused and just pulled out more money. They rely on the confusion and the fact that it all happens so quickly and perhaps tourists are not so familiar with the currency. And this feeling that once you have ordered it you have to pay for it. I said No and walked away and they were pissed but its a massive scam. Lots of other people were walking away thinking what just happened. Yes you paid 40 euros plus for a plastic plate of cheap food!!! Just be careful and do not buy it. Three people can eat in a sit down restaurant for the same price. If you are desperate to try 'Prague Ham' which essentially is normal ham inflated for tourists...go to a restaurant where you will have a fixed price. If you want to buy food on the street, the Tredlniks are great at 40 czk each and are these circular pastries. Everywhere sells them. The hots dogs also are cheap too. There is also gelato everywhere which is delicious."

Lined with medieval buildings around the square, it has the Opera, Tyn Church and Astronomical clock as its main attractions. The center of the square is filled with small souvenir shops and snack stalls. In winter dont miss to taste hot bread rolls and hot wine. Do take a walk behind the Tyn church along old cobbled streets and you land surprisingly in smaller squares which sell unique wooden witches which one buys to ward off evil spirits. Also the hourly event at the Astronomical clock is must see. Overall a delightful place........"

From the Astronomical Clock, The Powder Tower, The Charles Bridge and much more there is no shortage of things to see and do. To go beyond the Old Town the tram and subway are close by and easy to use. The Czech language is quite difficult but fortunately most people in the touristy areas understand and speak English.

Other then that the thing that made my trip even more terrible, you go in a restaurant to eat, and you need to pay 2 euro to wash your hands; the best thing is you even have to play in McDonalds and you know you have to wash your hands before eating there.Second, you go to exchange money, believe me use your MASTER CARD better then changing to local money coz the exchange office will literally rob you...if the people on the streets don`t do it firstr?!Really unsafe city, specially round the parks and even in the center of the city you can find people trying to sell you drugs or maybe even sell you a girl or a human heart (didn`t like to ask); The police is 10m from them and they don`t do any thing.You like to have a rest go and enjoy a Czech PUB, and get a BEER (Czech BEER was the only thing that made this trip to Prague not so terrible) ...but if you like to get the beer on your table you need to ask 10 times before they actually bring it to you...the waiter would like to actually e-mail you or slam the glass from your head;After this, there is no need for an other visit.One thing is for sure, its worth seen at least once in your life;"

Shop around though, a neighbouring one is often cheaper.Day and night there are street performers ranging from traditional music to spectacular acrobatics with a touch of comedy thrown in. The atmosphere was amazing, we spent three days quite happily sitting with a drink and people watching after a day's exploring.As with any big town or city, pick pockets are about.

Through the year there are seasonal markets (Christmas Market, Easter Market, Summer Events and much more). Walk! Do not use any form of transportation in downtown. Prague is the Capital and it is big but the historical part is so beautiful that you don't want to miss any of it. Get yourself some treat in Old Town and soak the atmosphere, you can walk any direction (Vltava river, Parizska Street, shopping mall at Namesti Republiky or Vaclavske Sq.) and you will see beauty. What you probably wont see is typical Czech citizens, but for City lovers this is the place to be. History, food, beer, clubs, party, art, Prague and Old Town especially is got it all! I love that place and no matter how many times I have been there and how much time I have spent there, I will be coming back. It is so beautiful that I got married in St. Nicolas Church <3"

The Old Town is well-preserved and charming, but in my visit over a weekend in July, it was uncomfortably mobbed with tourists. All its restaurants and shops cater to tourists. Food in this part of town isn't outstanding; it doesn't have to be. Waiters are very pleasant, but seem to automatically say, \"Service is not included in this country\" when picking up your check, even before checking to see if you've tipped. Taxi drivers demand a minimum $10 fee for even a 1km ride. I would recommend it more in the off-season."

This is the area east of the Vltava River and includes Charles Bridge, the Old Town Square all the way to Namesti Republiky. There is much to see and do in the Old Town and it is very easy to to spend much time in this area of Prague. Highlight attractions of the Old Town include the iconic Charles Bridge, which is easily one of the most famous bridges in the world and something that no visitor to the city should go without seeing at least once if not twice during their stay. Visitors will also find the world-famous Orlog, also known as the Astronomy Clock. This is probably the most easily recognisable clock in the world and something that visitors should try to see a couple different times during a trip to Prague. Additional attractions at the Old Town Square that are worth visiting include the nice Baroque church by the name of St. Nicholas (not to be confused Church of St. Nicholas located in Mala Strana), the Jan Huss Monument and the fairy-tale like Church of the Virgin Mary before Tyn whose towers boast fantastic Gothic spires. It is also worth visiting the Old Town Hall building where you find Orlog and the beautiful Goltz-Kinsky Palace in the old Square and perhaps finding the nearby Ungelt, also known as the Tyn Court, not far from the Old Square. We also very much enjoy the Municipal House building which is a great Art Nouveau scene in Prague at the far end of the Old Town, found next to the historic Powder Tower. We also enjoyed looking at various interesting statues in this district like the odd Kafka Monument near the Jewish Quarter and the Hanging Out Statue near the Bethlehem Church. Various small walkways, sidewalk cafes, coffee shops, local eateries, bar and souvenir shops can be visited, making this a very active area of the city. During our recent trip to Prague, we enjoyed our stay at Hotel Praha, right on the Old Town Square and had a decent stay. We tried a few restaurants, cafes and coffee shops in the area, some of which we were quite pleased with. These included breakfasts taken at the Cafe Mozart, which is directly on the Old Town Square. We very much enjoyed a coffee stop made at Cafe Ebel and found our dinner at U Medvidku and lunch stop at Tonino Lamborghini Pastacaffe to be decent. Other meals taken in the area weren't worthy of recommendation. Overall, we have always enjoyed spending time in the Old Town during trips to Prague but are now preferring the Mala Strana 'Lesser Quarter' and the Hradcany 'Castle' districts on the other side of the Vltava River a bit more. However, can't imagine visiting Prague and not spending some quality time in this area of the city."

But the crush of tourists, and the mass of accompanying hucksters and shills selling cheap souvenirs, turned me off. Nonetheless, anyone visiting Prague for the first time needs to see and experience this part of the city."

This site puts you in touch with Prague locals who will take you on private guided walking tours of their city. There are several guides to choose from at various prices. We choose Willy, who showed up at our hotel promptly at 9:30 am and took us on a five hour walking tour of Prague. His knowledge of the history of his city, advice on where to eat and what to see later on our own, his information on all the major sights was great! We got a good orientation to the city, got recommendations on what to see later, got taken to all the major sights, like churches, town hall, monuments, clock, Jewish district, and learned so much about everything. This made the next two days easy to get around, take in more sights and feel comfortable in the city. I highly recommend taking a tour with one of the \"Tours By Locals\" guides. It helped us feel comfortable in the city."

This gorgeous old town has been impeccably maintained and restored, through so many years, governments, rulers and wars. It is such a gem to have it be in this state...treaure it Prague!! Not all cities were so fortunate. We took several organized tours to hear about all the history, timetables and origins...but over it all I think our favorite thing was to just get lost and explore those charming streets. Do not miss this old town!"

Everybody had a smile on their faces, the people, local and tourists alike, were very kind, no shoving, no pushing. I bought hand made mugs for coffee and tea. I recommend the natural soaps also. It is a very vibrant city, tones of architecture to look at, many charming street, mesmerizing views of the city from a high point. I especially enjoyed the dancing house, it is a breath of fresh air, surreal, and oddly fitting with aged buildings.Prague is a city which I would definitely choose to come back to, it is the story we all need one in a while."

The town square gets crowded but disperses as soon as the clock has chimed so if you don't like crowds its best to go just after the hour. There are numerous concerts - many playing virtually the same programme so check carefully before booking - unless you like comparing performances of the same pieces. We found it a safe city but did witness a mugging. There was a quick response from 4 guys who came running from all sides of the square, apprehended the assailant, returned the stolen goods and everyone went on their way. We found that interesting restaurants tended to be away from the main streets but the tourist places are reliable and not too over priced. Vegetarians will struggle but there is usually fish available."

We went to the top of the tower to get a view from up above and that in itself was a great experience with views across to the castle as well as to Vysehrad and the outer districts of Prague. Tyn Church is a truly stunning church once inside and is an oasis of quiet in the otherwise bustling square. The jewish museum is not too far from the square and can be walked to comfortably.Try catching lunch and a drink at one of the numerous cafes on the old town square and sit back and enjoy the atmosphere of this beautiful place."

Walking in the streets themselves, however, leaves something to be desired... there are innumerable money changing booths, (junky) souvenir stores, and costumed actors asking for money. More than I've seen in any other city, by far (e.g.; more than New York, London, Vienna, Tokyo, Budapest, etc etc etc). Unfortunately, there is not very much interesting going on in this area. Seriously, how many times can one person change their money to Crowns or buy trinkets to take home? How about adding some specialty stores that sell identifiably Czech things? Limiting the money changing shops to one or two per street? Despite all this, you really have to at least see this area to imagine what it once looked like as it is, in its bones, one of the most beautiful cities around. This is why I still give it 4/5 stars. Maybe someday it will be more pleasant to walk around here :)."

Winding streets, beautiful buildings and innumerable amount of bars & cafes. Really enjoyed my visit.We had some lovely food, However be careful some of the cafes are charging outrageous prices for coffees & water etc."

We enjoyed our walks there both during the day and the evenings, though it was rather cold when we were there with temperatures ranging from 1-2 centigrade in the evenings to a maximum of 9 in the mornings and we did not see the sun throughout our stay there during the third week of November.

I particularly recommend the tredlnik or tredlo pastries. Simple sweet bread with sugar and sometimes nuts in a spiral. The traditional Prague Ham is divine - juicy and flavoursome.TIP: Also at the food stalls (see photo) be aware that you can just order 100g portions if you wish for about \u00a31.

There were easily over half a million people there on New Years Eve and while things got wild, the police presence while there were not overwhelming. We are a middle aged couple and enjoyed mingling with kids, families and older folks. Most interesting was the fact that New Years Eve there was trash and broken glass everywhere from the revelers. The next day the place was spotless. There are ample public toilets which are clean and found everywhere. There is lots to see and do and we were'nt bored for a moment. See the Clock Tower and take a walking tour. Everything here is price worthy and a good value."

Visiting the Old Town do not miss the chance to get on one of the towers (either the clock-tower of the one at the beginning of the Charles bridge).

There's an elevator and you can stand right next to the bugler in period costume who goes to each side of the tower and blows a melody signaling the time.Another star of Stare Mesto (Old Town) is the spectacular Church of Our Lady before Tyn. Its spires tower some 250 feet above the square and no Disney princess castle has anything on this 700+ year-old structure.

The Old town is actually quiet small and you can easily cover it in a day."

It is located directly in the center with direct connection to the old Town Square. When you are standing on the small Square right before the MICHALSKA STREET, to your right you can see a small Market with local products and small cute Souvenirs, it is a joy to strall through the nice szene. Entering the MICHALSKA STREET to your left you will find one of the most unique Shopping Opportunities; the Store is called \"Gemory\" and has a great variaty of gem stones in different modern settings. It is a joy to finally see something different than all the classical garnet and amber all around. The prices are very good and the Quality high. Across the Street from the \"Gemory\" is a typical czech wine Bar where you can find lots of locals and musicians drinking their wine while singing Songs and creating a nice atmosphere. Further down the street you will find one of the most exclusive vintage Stores in Prague where you can find rare and Special pieces from Chanel, Dior and so on. Also along the street you will find small Galleries and typical czech handycraft Stores. The small Passage on the end of the MICHALSKA STREET will bring you right down to the Old Town Square and the astronomical Clock."

If you go to the town center, it may be crowded on a football night...there is a huge tv in the center to watch the games and people from everywhere attend. The great thing is that you can sit back at an outdoor cafe or bar and people watch in such a beautiful historical setting. Definitely hope to visit again!"

Prague Old Town is a fantastic place to visit whether you are interested in it's long and interesting history, it's amazing architecture or if you just appreciate a good beer in phenomenal surroundings.There are many \"must sees\" like the astronomical clock in the old town square (the last working example of only three ever made in the world), the Charles Bridge or Karlov Most (possibly the most romantic bridge in the world) and the Church of Our Lady before Tyn, a fine example of Gothic architecture from the 14th century.Getting around on foot is easy if not a little confusing at times, I would strongly recommend getting a guide book, we used the TimeOut guide which we found to be excellent.There are many tourist shops selling cheaply made in China, over-priced tat but if you are looking for souvenirs I would suggest a visit to the daily market in Havelska where you will find all the usual bits and bats but lower prices and stall owners who will haggle.Bars and restaurants are everywhere and prices vary vastly from establishment to establishment. Price does not give any indication of quality as most places are selling exactly the same beer and food, the only difference seems to be the location. As a rule of thumb, I would check the price of 0.5l of beer (pivo). 30Kc is good for the town centre and the food will be reasonably priced too. If you pay double that for beer, expect to pay double for the food too.Wenceslas Square, which is not really a square but a long and very wide main road, is the site of many big-name shops such as M&S and Debenhams and also the annual Christmas market but has unfortunately deteriorated over the last ten years into a red-light area. It is still safe enough to wander about but single men and groups that look like a stag party will find themselves harrassed by prostitutes and drug dealers. Take more care in this area after midnight. A local told us that the area was run by the police during the day and the mafia by night. As in all main cities, be vigilant, especially of pickpockets."

It was separated from the outside by a semi-circular moat and wall, connected to the Vltava at both of its ends. The moat is now covered up by the streets (from north to south-west) Revolu\u010dni, Na P\u0159\u00edkop\u011b, and N\u00e1rodni\u2014which remain the official boundary of the cadastral district of Old Town. It is now in Praha 1.Soon after the city was expanded in the 14th century by Charles IV with the founding of the New Town, the moat and wall were dismantledNotable places in the Old Town include the Old New Synagogue, Old Town Square and Astronomical Clock. Across the river Vltava is the Lesser Quarter, called Mal\u00e1 Strana in Czech. These two parts of the town are connected by Charles Bridge. Josefov is located in the northwest corner of Old Town heading towards the Vltava.The Astronomical clock is an amazing piece of engineering and is over 500 years old. Sipping a hot chocolate in the cafe opposite while watching it perform is one of those sublime moments - the hot chocolate was also very good.you can spend the whole day in this place. it is so nice and alive. many restaurants, bars and nice settings all over the square plus the old clock every hour they have the show on the top of it.It's going to be the place everyone visits."

It is a pleasure to walk in those small streets, or at least it would be...if there were a bit less tourists or if the city had a better organization for receiving so many people. We were there the last week of October, and all streets around Old town square and all the way down to Charles' bridge were so packed that it was difficult just to walk through, and this at all times of the day and even worse in the evening. Thousands of souvenir shops with portable stereos at their doorstep yelling bad music, drunk groups everywhere from early in the evening, the whole place smelled and felt like tailored for low class tourism. What a difference with Vienna!I cannot start to imagine how things must be like in really high season!As a conclusion, I'll say \"I'll be back\"; maybe in a few years when things have matured and I'll try to find out if there is something like a low season there, because that's when I'll be going!"

The gothic-style architecture differentiates this place from many other popular tourist cities There is a lot to see & make sure you bring a map because it is pretty easy to get lost. I found that some maps try to translate the Czech roads in English & this screwed me up a few times. Get a Czech map with substantial road detail and you will be fine.I hate to sound like a travel snob but Prague overall for me was a bit of a let down. Even putting the castle aside which was the biggest disappointment, the old town area wasn't all that special in comparison to many other cities in Europe. I would also go further to say that it was the least clean & well kept of all historic cities I have seen so far. This city also goes down as the most annoying that I've visited as it was packed with large tourist groups at every turn and you are bothered every 5 minutes by either a street vendor or a beggar. Architecture aside, all the negatives reminded me most of NYC. One can see why many American kids come to study here.When in Prague, old town is obviously a must - but overall I think there are better places in Europe to spend your time."

I completely endorse going through and seeing anything that you might be interested in. But, there is no reason to hang out or buy anything/eat anything on the square. Brussels, Krakow, and Bruges all do it better.The souvenir shops around the square blare loud, weird rap music which is off putting, and they're not selling anything interesting.

We loved Old Town, so quaint, even though the Town Center can become quite crowded with tourists, especially a the hour when the Astronomical Clock does its thing. You really get the feeling of a Medieval Town, with the Gunpowder Tower as the gateway into Old Town, and the Gothic Church opposite the square. Don't miss the clock, it is a main attraction, however, make sure you are aware that this is the perfect spot for pickpockets. The Church of Tyn, is also something to see. In Old Town is the Hotel Prince, and if you want an experience, go up to the roof terrace for a capuccino and a breathtaking view of the city. The food is nothing to write home about, but the view is worth spending a few crowns to have a bite there. See the Town hall it is also beautiful. There is plenty of shopping for those who are so inclined. Don't miss it, the people are friendly, speak English and are absolutely wonderful."

You need to carry a good city map and be willing to put it in your pocket and wander to see what you stumble upon and then find your point of reference on the map. It is great fun and there is something to see no matter where you go.Look for the free city tour guides in red t-shirts. If their group is in your language, you can tag along at no charge and drop off at any time. They have great history and facts about the people and place.Learn that there are three subway lines as well as bus and trams. The system allows you to buy a three day pass for 310 czk but you really need to ride at least 5 times a day to make it pay. Instead get a single pass for 24 czk which only starts when you first validate it inside the station or tram. You can then ride for 30 minutes which gets you nearly anywhere you need to go! We use the system to get us back to our hotel at the end of the day once we are exhausted. Just ensure you go with coins as the automats in the stations do not accept bills or credit cards.There are tons of great things in Old Town. My favorites: Old Square, Charles Bridge, Jewish Quarter, Wenceslas Square, Maiselova Street is like the Champs Elysee with highest end shopping.Don't eat in Old Town!! It is far too expensive. Instead, snack around buying from street vendors. You can get a great sausage in baguette for only 60 czk (USD 3) and many other reasonable foods.Look for the WC everywhere if you require a toilet. You will need to have 10 czk coins for them but if you pay the facilities are usually clean and worth the small cost."

Old Town Square was really lovely but on the first day it was very rowdy with lots of police there monitoring all the heavy drinking and smashing of glasses and singing. We loved the Astronomical clock and St. Nicholas Church. The cafes and restaurants were all nice, a bit expensive we thought, one waiter was a bit aggressive when he thought we weren't giving him a tip. But we did return to the Square nearly everyday at some point to watch the horses and carriages and music entertainment and many wedding couples just married paraded throughout."

But stay away from the ham vendors in the square; they post a price of 90 per 100 grams then put 400 grams on your plate. When told you didn't want that much, they say \"you want it or you don't? That's how we sell it.\" Very obnoxious."

Went on a 4 day weekend city break here last weekend, me and my partner were immensely impressed with the sights and the range of bars, shops, attractions and restaurants available in central Prague (and the prices).We visited 2 fab restaurants, one next to Charles bridge (superb outdoor dining area) and a restaurant adjacent to the clock tower , the food was exquisite. If you can, buy an icecream from one of a few ice cream chain shops , delicious! Starapromen beer is usually around 40kc which is just over \u00a31. Wine is also a good price! The all in one tram, metro and bus ticket is highly recommended as they are cheap and take you into and among the old town and as far as you want within Prague! We particularly enjoyed the Gastronomy museum which is situated east to the square, run by a couple whose mother and father were famous czech cuisine recipe book authors , excellent value for money and lots of amazing facts about the progression of food, dining and cooking (and if you're lucky the owners show you their amazing high tech kitchen and offer you a free refreshing glass of ice cold water from their high tech refrigerator! )The National Czech museum is not bad although the older museum building across the road is closed until 1916! Some good things to see in the modern building about prioneer Czech inventors. A highly recommended city break !! :-) Me and my partner are both 24 and we think Prague is perfect for any age and all types of travelling groups.We would recommend that if you wish to travel to Prague in the summer it may involve long walks in the hot sun, we found large bottles of water from mini stalls on the large shopping street in front of the old national museum building, one stall sold water for 25ck for 1.5 liters :-)"

If its Bohemian Glass then just about every shop sells it and some actually make it. Best buys apart from glass and ceramics are the usual souvenirs and they are in abundance.In and around Wenceslas Sq you will find all the usual familiar stores but check out in Wenceslas Sq the massive 5 story Bata shoe store for a dizzying array of shoes and styles and prices across the board ....you will find something you like.There is also the Palladium Shopping Mall which is just like any other modern Mall .... the only good thing about it is the Food Court on the top floor which is cheap (mainly western food) ... the escalators are annoying and you have to cross from one side of the Mall to keep going up or down ...... the Palladium is just worth dipping into then out again"

There is plenty to see and many places to shop. They are open till late on Fridays and Saturdays, too.

Always look around for a bargain and barter a bit as well.There are horse and cart rides, old car rides, bike rides just about anything goes. We even found a bar with large beds to lay on and have cocktails and watch TV !!Watch out for pickpockets, we didn't have any trouble but you just need to be aware where your bags are. We chose to walk everywhere at our slow pace and enjoyed just being around the history, the cobblestone streets are a bit hard so you would need to wear good walking shoes.

We purposely avoided public transportation because walking was so enjoyable and allowed us to see more, even in the rain. The Old Town is in the heart of the city and is obviously the main draw. I will admit that even in April it was VERY crowded in some areas (I can't imagine what it's like during high season!). This was the only downside. However, it's popular and everyone loves it for very good reasons. The architecture is old, colorful, ornate, and well preserved. There are restaurants, cafes, shops, and cobblestone streets. It's truly a delightful area, despite the touristy vibe at times.To make the most of your visit, I recommend visiting the Old Town in the evening. After dark the crowds start to dwindle and the city takes on a romantic ambiance. Also, the farther you go from the centralized areas, especially the Charles Bridge where everyone seems to gather, the fewer the people. Spend some time wandering around and distancing yourself from the main sights - I guarantee you'll end up taking photos of things you didn't know about!Although the Old Town is wonderful, I also suggest visiting the Lesser Quarter, Castle District and Jewish Ghetto. There are three amazing areas of the city that also shouldn't be missed. They're not nearly as popular, but they're just as great and offer completely different experiences.One more thing I'd like to add: As I mentioned before, we were there during early/ mid April. It was the week after Easter and their festival was still taking place in the Main Square... What a blast! There were live bands playing music and dance performances as well as local foods and desserts. The area was crowded but still fun. It was a great time of the year to visit."

There's a valuable Starbucks on the same square for coffee, bakery and free W.C. Also left of the Clock is where the tour companies' employees stand with colorful umbrellas hoping to sell daytours in various languages. If I rented an apartment again in Prague, I think it would be on a quiet street near Old Town to be near the sites."

You have to be a short distance from the entrance and the facade to look up and see all of it. Anyone know why the houses do not break in front of Tyn Church as one would expect?In the last years the crowd of tourist agents, guides, restaurant promoters and touts has increased to spoil the magic of this square.

Hotels are expensive and tourists are invading from every direction, it is difficult to get a true sense of culture or authenticity of this place due to the way Prague caters for tourism. Most places you will have to pay for, even churches and to bring your camera into the National Museum. Just be cautious that you will have to pay a lot for all the tourist sites which is a shame but Prague will still attract you not for the lust of going to a place off the beaten track but to tick the box."

Most people don't want to advertise they are tourists, but that's about all that is around, so use the map to stay cognizant of where you are and where you want to go. Much to do.

In three days I've visited all the must-do tourist attraction, avoiding some of the most obvious tourist traps. The Old Town looks very pretty, but it's far too crowded with tourists. At day, herds of tourists everywhere, at night, you keep on meeting groups of drunk tourists (even if the streets much less crowded). Both at day and night the city is fascinating. I suggest a visit to Prague and expect to see the most of the tourist attractions in a few days. Also keep calm as all those tourists standing before you in your picture will test your nerves. I loved Prague, its food and scapes. So, I suggest, at least once, a trip in this city."

The square just off the main square on the way to the Powder Tower was quiet and lovely and much more in keeping with the true flavor of Old Prague"

I'm not sure what the attraction was, but the crowds in the square and on Charles Bridge rival those I've seen anywhere - including in St. Mark's in Venice. Tacky souvenir shops dominate the retail scene. Beware of pickpockets and scam artists who offer high exchange rates on the streets outside the official exchange bureaus. I've never stayed in a hotel with so much street noise and we were several blocks off the square. Be sure to have a detailed map with you."

Very crowded though and the Easter Market was on whilst we were there, met two people that unfortunately had been victims of pickpockets, but with so many people, it is bound to happen. Hot mulled wine very welcome, ham/pork be careful the price given is for 100g and of course they load your plate and before you know it they want 600kr instead of the 89kr you thought you were paying. Easter entertainment started every afternoon and we saw some wonderful childrens choir and dance and some lovely folky groups, all for free. So go enjoy but be a little careful."

There is also an open area with stalls that sells a variety of souvenirs, caps and beanies, wooden toys at very reasonable price, at least much cheaper than those in the shops. From Old Town, we walked to Wenceslas Square where the high street brands are located at the Na Prikope street. For high end luxury brands, head to Parizska street.Toilet tips: There is not much free ones out there, McD charges per visit, but if you purchase something from them, they will give you a chip to access the toilets for free.

We found we could walk everywhere from that base, but the streets can be a maze so take a street map! The food is generous and if you try the local food and local beers, which I recommend you do, the prices are very reasonable as long as you avoid the most touristy places, just one street back from the old town square and the prices for food and beer were 50% to 60% cheaper! the locals were friendly and the town utterly beautiful under a cover of snow, but make sure you take sensible shoes and wrap up well in winter as it will be very cold! we went everywhere in walking boots and would have struggled otherwise. I cannot wait to go back to this lovely city."

Beer is expensive, more expensive than the UK and street vendors tend to sell their food by weight and you get very large portions!!

Great little shop on the right hand side just as you enter through the arch that sells very well made and very fair priced Pashmina scarves. Do barter as I knocked a bit off of two from the already cheap price. As you walk up the main street, there is a little eatery directly across from a guard manned door to the church (man in red uniform ever present at it). The food was AMAZING and extremely well priced. It was a place with about 4 outdoor tables and a large indoor seating area. Wish I could remember the name but we will be going there repeatedly when we come back next year. I just remember that we sat directly across from the guard at that church door. In my opinion, the buildings here (if you love old ornate wooden/carved doors, you will love this district) and decor are the best in Prague. Not to say the rest of town isn't pretty awesome. It's just that here, you feel the history. It's palpable. This town itself quickly became my favorite in Europe thus far. If you happen through Wenceslas Square, there is an Asian massage/spa across from McDonalds (opposite end from the National Museum) that has silerfish in tanks displayed in the window. My daughter and I walked by several time and were fascinated by the people with their feet dangling in there. The fish were all over their feet. On our last day we decided to see what this was all about. Our feet were KILLING us at this point. We went in, paid and plopped out feet in the tank. After the first minute or so of tickle, it was great! Once done, my feet didn't hurt in the slightest! Weird as hell, but I would do it again in a heartbeat!"

Only Czech Koruna in cash.@ All the exchange offices show a big ''ZERO% commission'' while actually they have commissions (I have used 4 offices and the situation was the same!!!)@ Many streets around Old Town are full of hostel/hotels/restaurants, which would be good if they wouldn't charge you 10\u00a3 for 200g of pizza.@ Many streets are full of souvenir shops or beautifully-named ''art galleries'', which look very posh with their crystals/pottery. These shops make the whole place look like a colourful kitch. - look in the dictionary@ Celetna, the street which links the Tyn church and the Powder Tower is ''The queen on kitch'' @ Many of the tourists I saw were Czech/Slovak and they don't really care about the others. They shamelessly kick you without apologizing, in any language!@ There are virtually no benches to sit, should you be willing to admire the surroundings!I am truly sorry to have written such a review. I met some wonderful Czechs in Prague, but this is my genuine opinion on the Old Town..a carefully-arranged trap around The Old Square!"

The Old Town offers a unique blend of architecture from the early Gothic to Renaissance, Baroque and also classy Art Nouveau. I also like the atmosphere, it is always buzzing and in the summer full of street cafes where one an sit and watch the world go by. At night it becomes a magical place when all the beautiful buildings are illuminated and one can really feel like being in the middle of the theatre stage in a fairy tale like setting. What I don't like, are some of the tacky souvenir shops selling tasteless stuff and totally irrelevant to the Czech culture (all those Russian dolls for example...). Also some of the pubs and restaurants are very touristic and overpriced. In my opinion there is a huge potential in making some of those lovely streets more elegant and classy instead of being full of this kitschy stuff. "

I think its name is Tyn Church, Also Saint Nicholas Church is there and the Old Town Clock Tower. In one its walls is the famous astronomical clock. There is also a nice monument in the middle of the square but I can't remember the name of it.Again, please be alert if you are among the crowd watching the astronomical clock. Pickpockets are watching who is distracted."

We tried a couple of restaurants and found the waiters friendly and down to earth and the food plentiful and tasty. We sat in a bar called the Black Bull right opposite the astronomical clock and watched as the crowds gathered each hour to watch this clock do its thing whilst it chimed the hour. Again, the waiters were friendly and attentive.Quite busy at times as we went in December when the xmas market was at it's height - sometimes you couldn't get close enough to the stalls to have a look as there were so many people trying to do the same thing.The food on the stalls was yummy but could be quite pricey unless you tell them when to stop filling the container as they sell the food by weight."

            "review": "Just the tonic needed at the start of winter. Just returned from a fantastic 3 night break away in this wonderful city, for the traditional Christmas market. By European standards the city is small, so it's easy to learn your way around in a weekend. Walking is by far the best way to soak up the atmosphere, but there is an efficient tram, metro & bus public transport system. You can buy tickets at stations & at the airport's information desk, which also has a detailed English language guide to the system. For a taxi, I would recommend City Taxi.Start on Wenceslas Square; still the centre of the modern city, it is, in fact, a wide avenue lined with shops. It's a good base to get your bearings. Ambling through cobbled streets, walk down to the majesty of the city's Old Town Square, with its brightly coloured baroque facades overshadowed by the vast Gothic twin towers of Tyn church. A market place since the middle ages, the Square has many of Prague's most beautiful buildings, as well as the 16th-century Astronomical Clock on the Old Town Hall.Along Karlova the medieval 14th-century Charles Bridge is probably the most photographed sight in Prague.If you want to go shopping you can head for the lively market on Havelska. Alternatively the tree-lined Parizska Street is Prague's equivalent of London's Bond Street.For contemplation, Europe's oldest preserved historic synagogues & the Old Jewish cemetery are in the Josefov quarter.Finally, there is Obecni Dum, a vast art nouveau complex in Namesti Republiky.Top tip - avoid the tourist crowds along Karlova & the Charles Bridge with an early start."

We were lucky enough to find an apartment rental with views of the Charles Bridge and Prague Castle. This area of town is quiet, quaint, and historic. You will be a stone's throw from St Nicholas Church (and square), the Charles Bridge with its historic towers and lovely collection of statues, and lots of shopping, restaurants, and colorful beer gardens. The area is also close to trams and bus stops if you're not up to walking all day. While the Old Town Square is buzzing with tourists at all times of the night and day, you will find the Stare Mesto to be quiet and romantic, especially after dark. I highly recommend this area when looking for a place to stay, and it's a lovely place to spend a day taking in the shops, churches and local sites - including Prague Castle."

Virtually every style of architecture can be experienced. My favourite was Tyn Church near the Old Town Centre. The detailing on the buildings was amazing, even relatively ordinary buildings had amazing statues and carvings over doorways and on the roofs. Random statues appeared all over. A little girl sitting on a building ledge, reading a book. A man hanging from a pole protruding out over the road. You could spend a lifetime there and still want more."

Couple this together with the lack of resources in socialistic time which meant no big changes and a tschech government that has seen pretty early the touristical value of the old town and renovated generously you do come to an old town which has survived the centuries pretty well and gives a good insight into how this city was built, dozens of architectural monuments, statues, paintings, interesting old cafes and restaurants, small hidden streets and attractions, a lot of old churches with the old glass paintings mostly still intact and a more or less unique atmosphere. Additionally the gastronomy has picked up so you can have a good al fresco meal in the summer at dozens of places. Take your time to enjoy it but beware that during high season it is packed and in the old town you do of course pay higher prices that just a couple of hundred meters away. Also be aware of scums when it comes to currency exchange. Read the signs of the exchange offices carefully."

            "review": "you have to spend some time in Old Town. We were in Prague for 7 days and we went to Old town 4 different days. Each time we went we were passing through but there was something great going on and we had to stop and see. We first took a tour which was the best way to understand the clock and the other structures in the old town square, it is important to know about the flood and reasoning behind why the structures are a certain way so please take a tour. The other times we went to have some street food and watch the performers. There were jugglers using fire torches and people in costume walking on stilts. This is a great place to hang out and just people watch as well. The food and hotels right in this area are priced higher then other areas so be sure to eat a sit down meal outside of old town so you can get a great deal and not so touristy food. Old town is just plain good fun."

            "review": "Touristy but definitely worth the walk around. Quite touristy but good for a walk around doing some window shopping and taking in the style of buildings you are surrounded by. Worth the foot trip.Food & drink is very expensive around this area so go a few streets back and you will get just as nice food for half the price."

The square in the old town has a great atmoshpere due to all small restaurants and cofee shops and it is always full of people. Enjoy czeck dark beer and great food."

            "review": "very touristy but very cool to walk around. We traveled in the summer and Old Town was a little overwhelming just because it was so crowded but the narrow cobblestone streets and cool architecture made it fun to walk around. There are also tons of shops and restaurants so it's very tourist friendly. We saw the astronomical clock and wandered around taking pictures of all the interesting buildings. Then we went into way too many shops and probably spent way too much but there was just so much cool stuff. There was tons of artwork, glass art, and puppets that kept catching our eyes. This is a great area for walking around and doing your souvenir shopping."
