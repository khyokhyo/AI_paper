Just cross over the river Vltava through Charles bridge and you are here. Nice gardens, historical buildings from romanesque, gothic, renaissance, baroque can bring you backward. It is highly recommended to come here and see everything with your own eyes."

Charming part of the old Prague where one can find everything: beautiful buildings and old streets, crowds of tourists and quiet lane as parks, cafes, restaurants, tourist shops, galleries. A number of famous touris objects are there, like St. Nicholas Basilica, Our Lady church with Prazske Jezulatko, etc. Prague Loreto is also in this part, though geographically it belongs more to Hradczany district. Take your time and wander away from the beaten tourist tracks. There are many lovely places to see in Mala Strana, for example Vojanovy garden or Cerninsky palace and garden and narrow, winding lanes around it."

Away from the hustle and bustle of the magnificent old town, it is filled with the most spectacular pieces of architecture in the many museums, churches, restaurants etc. If you like period hotels this is the place to stay. A short walk over the romantic Charles Bridge at midnight is a mystical experience. Mala Strana has a very Parisian feeling to it with the narrow cobbled streets. Down the steps, and under Charles Bridge you will find the lock bridges and a beautiful working water wheel. Kampa island along by the waterside in the evening is a lovely experience. Mala Strana will stay in your heart forever."

This is a beautiful if lesser known area of Prague, best known of course for the Castle, although it has a lot more to offer than that. The architecture around the main road Nerudova Street is particularly inspiring, along with of course the beautiful St Nicholas Church. There is however much more to the area than this, with much to see and explore - among other things, Petrin Hill, Kampa Park and the famous John Lennon Wall, each of which are well worth a visit in their own right. This is an area of the city perhaps less frequented by visitors, but is in some ways even more beautiful due to the fact that is that much more quiet, giving an altogether more authentic experience of Prague, yet still within walking distance of the main sites across the river. If I were to visit Prague again, I would probably choose to stay in this area for all of the reasons stated above. It also happens to be home to some of the cities finest vegetarian restaurants, which is even more of a reason to visit."

We were staying at the Golden Star, in Hradcany which is adjacent to Mala Strana, at the end of Nerudova street, so of course for us it was easy, it was right at our doorstep, we were right in the heart of the quarter.The architecture is really different from the Old Town ... 17th and 18th Century, not at all less beautiful and really worth some walks.Some of my friends, way savvier than me in matter of pubs, beers, restaurants and good food are convinced that you eat better and drink better in Mala Strana than in the rest of Prague ...There are there very famous names so without putting in competition the 2 sides of the Vlatva River let's say that if you don't visit, stay or eat at Mala Strana, you have tasted only half of Prague.I believe anyway that you'll have no choice and be there because ... it is on the other side of the Charles Bridge, on your way to the Prague Castle and St Vitus Cathedral ...So .. Give it some more time and visit the Wallenstein Gardens, may be Strahov Monastery and Library, the lovely narrow streets all around... they all are so close .. .and even Petrin Hill...Give it a full day at least and you'll make the most of Prague ...You can take a look at some of the pictures I have attached to see for yourself if the place is worth your time .. I believe it is ...And if you have more time, wait till dusk and you won't regret it: the view on Prague at Night from the Prague Castle or Petrin Hill is superb and even unforgettable."

This castle is surely a must visit place in Prague hence no wonder its always crowded. Accessible by tram, I would recommend any visitor to take a tram through scenic view of Prague going up to the hill before reaching the castle, then on your way back you can take either metro (from Malostranska) or another tram from the nearest stop. Here's what you should do around this castle:- Take a picture with the royal guard at the entrance (or, the soldier usually stands nearby).- Its difficult to get great picture of the cathedral because it has narrow space between the building. Try going to the corner of the front building to get better view, or go to the back of the the cathedral- Have a light brunch/lunch at Rozmbersky (palace Cafe) with full scene of Prague. - Another scenic photo stop of Prague city can be taken from small cafe at the exit way (before the stair down from Mala Strana)."

There are interesting smaller shops, churches, traditional Czech Pubs, bars and restaurants, but all in a more quieter area away from the buzzing tourist area in Old Town. It just seemed more laid back and relaxed. This is a part that reminds me what Old Prague must have been like..... Lots of cobble stone streets and lanes, wear comfy shoes. Keep watching out for some of the beautiful big old gates, they sure are worth to take pictures of!"

This is a beautiful part of Prague; but the crowds between the Old Town Sq and Mala Strana (on a September evening) were horrendous. I guess if you are an early riser (not us!) then it might be worth trying to go there really early in the morning. I was there a few years ago at Christmas and it was much less crowded to be fair. There are good Czech restaurants there and loads of little quirky gift shops, as well as lovely, well preserved architecture."

The area is a lot quieter than the touristy parts of Prague. It was nice to take a short walk over the bridge into the crowds and famous sights, but to return to a more peaceful area was priceless. It was a nice retreat to not have to be kept up all night by the the tourists that flood the city, especially in the summer. The castle is on this side of town, which was just a short walk...although up hill."

While it has about the same building architecture as the Old Town (Staro Mesto), it is much less crowded. The reason is probably the lesser amount of What-To-Do's compared to the Old Town, and the rather boring south area of Mala Strana.The main historic attractions worth visit are the St. Nicolas Church in Mala Strana and Wallenstein Palace with its Beautiful Garden. Kampa Island and its park are a nice place for a lovely stroll.But the best places are actually the \"modern\" ones: The Lennon Wall, David Cerny's statues of the Crawling Babies and the Pissing Fountain (and a few other modern monuments scattered throughout Mala Strana), The Kafka Museum, and the hidden gem of Mala Strana - the Karel Zeman Museum of Film Special Effects.If you are going to the Prague Castle from the Old Town (or back) by foot, I would suggest going through either Nerudova st. or Thunovska st. Both offer a nice walk along a line of colourful houses.I'm not sure if Petrin Hill considered a part of Mala Strana, but to me it seems like it does not have a lot to offer. Besides being a hill it also rather remote by foot, which means you likely be very tired afterwards. The Petrin Tower, Mirror Maze, the Hunger Wall and the Stefanik Observatory are the only attractions that seem to be worth a visit."

The narrow cobblestone streets, the fancy restaurants by the river with amazing views, the simple and cosy cafes in every nook and cranny. The small ice-cream shops. A gorgeous tiny flower shop. The mosaic sidewalks that add such richness, with designs made from small two inch granite cubes set in sand centuries ago. Clever, how the design often matches the site. A repeat pattern - row of crosses in front of a church, or a wine glass pattern in front of a restaurant. A small but well chosen detail that adds to the beauty to be enjoyed for years to come.My favorite churches on Mala Strana vary in size and prominence. The baroque St. Nicholas church is truly grand, one of the most beautiful and most visited in Prague. The church of Our Lady Victorious - Infant Jesus of Prague and the church of Our Lady beneath the Chain are my all time favorites.I love the well kept parks , Kampa, Vojanovy sady, swans on the river and peacocks strutting their stuff. The Funicular that starts out on Ujezd and takes you up to Nebozizek and top of the Petrin hill. Just steps off the beaten path are the hidden renaissance and baroque gardens. Vrtbovska, Wallenstein and Ledebour gardens are beautifully kept and in bloom most of the year. I love the aluring small crooked streets and the well known Nerudova street with the attractive house signs adorning the centuries old houses. The contrast of the large Palaces. Mostecka street with the beautiful pastel color houses, leading to the Charles bridge.The small Malostranske and Maltezske Square, the first one busy, the other almost serene.The Certovka stream with the ancient at times rickety wheel and the ever changing look of the Vltava river. And the Legii Bridge to watch fireworks from on New Years day.The centuries old monasteries converted into luxurious boutique hotels, with old pubs right next to them. Lenon wall...The beautiful old horse-chestnut trees...The screeching trams that always have the right of way... All that and more is Mala Strana - my favorite part of the world..."

We stayed in a hotel in Mala Strana and couldn't have booked a better place to stay. It is short enough a walk to walk into the Old Town, upto the castle but is far enough to avoid any evening noise from the popular tourist areas."

Look for the Wallenstein Palace built in 1623, churches, Embassy's, the Petrin Lookout Tower, the Lennon Wall, several very sweet restaurants, great hotels... It's fun to stroll around."

My best advice is to start in old town square, walk on Charles bridge and get lost on the allies trying to go to the Castle, Old town and Charles bridge are not part of Malastrana but you should give like 5 hours of your day to do all this, you are going to see a big part of Prague like no one else, of course you need to do this by walking."

Surprisingly, it was called the New Town when it was found in the 13th century but later changed to the present name when the existing New Town on the east bank of Vltava river came into being. It is different from the east side of the river as it has steeper streets and stairways and my general feeling is it is quieter and more peaceful. With the Prague Castle looming above, Lesser Town has a lot of its own attractions notably the St. Nicholas Church at Lesser Town Square, the Church of our Lady Victorious, famous for the infant Jesus of Prague effigy, the Petrin Lookout and the Lennon Wall. There are also plenty of restaurants, pubs and eateries in this part of the City so together with the Prague Castle, a whole day could be well spent in this quarter."

Do not make the mistake most tourists make that they hurry on to the Castle district and miss this quaint picturesque part of Prague. This area has lovely cobbled streets, historical burgher houses, ancient alleys and wonderful view of the river. It's nucleus is the Malostranske Namesti a Baroque square. You can see the Saint Nicholas Church here. There are lovely shops, eateries and pubs in this area. As the sun sets Mala Strana becomes all the more enchanting. The Lesser Town was established in the 8th century as a marketplace. It was ravaged by the war between the hussites and the Prague Army in 1419. Next the Great Fire of 1514 devastated this area. This is the reason most churches and palaces were built after the 17th century and are of Baroque or Renaissance style. When Amadeus was being shot Milos Forman chose Mala Strana rather than Vienna for several scenes to give the film the old time feel.Tip: Do visit Kampa Park and do try to walk in the back alleys of this district."

We were not disappointed, as the closer you walk to the other side of Charles Bridge, the more beautiful the views. A mixture of sculptures on the Bridge, musicians, small cobbled streets, smaller crowds make this area perfect. We had read that it was picturesque, but really we did not expect it to be so beautiful. we walked the streets on our way to St. Nicholas Church, and even stopped in the very large Starbucks (clean, free toilets, lots of seating, ) to take a rest before heading back. The church is also spectacular, and we wished we had more time to shop and explore the restaurants. Next time I go to Prague I will start Here and bypass the Old Town Square!"

Walk the cobble-stoned roads and wide mosaiced footpaths as you drink in the history of Prague. Those of you less inclined to walk can take a Segway ride or a comfortable ride in the red hotrods (that resemble vintage cars). It is a little long and steep walk up to the Prague Castle for those who don't want the bus or tram rides to intrude on their walk through the times.Amble through the bylanes or follow the tram tracks to discover the Church of the Lady Victorius and the Petrin Hill a little further up.Mala strana has a big tram and bus stop at the square (mala Strana Namesti) and the metro station (across the Wallenstein Garden). Plenty of options to spend your time at Mala Strana."

Located at the base of the castle and as you cross the Charles Bridge from Old Town Prague this is a lovely area not to be overlooked. At a minimum I suggest talking from the bridge up to the Little Quarter square (where the trams stop), at this location you can rest at Starbucks or get a bite at a number of good restaurants (tourist prices do apply). From here walk up to the castle through the various squares and streets (well marked), if you prefer you can continue past the castle steps and cross into the park and climb the observation tower and return to central Prague via the funicular or any number of walking paths. I\u2019ve spend more than a day (not all at once), just exploring this area over the course of many visits."

If you are folks like us who prefer to avoid the crowds and most touristy parts, but find joy in stumbling into delightful chance encounters and conversation, Mala Strana has lots to offer. Our week in January 2016 was perfect for wandering - dry and cold, with a few cms of snow to give that winter wonderland atmosphere. We strolled the back streets, seeing Malta Square, the Lennon Wall, the Church of St Nicholas, water wheels and a museum on the Kampa canal, the rather weird Alchemist's Museum, climbed up to Petrin Hill, and enjoyed the panorama from the replica of the Eiffel Tower (which does sway a little in the wind!), all the while trying various coffee shops. Our favourite area was just north of Charles Bridge near the Vltava river, where we enjoyed tea and cakes with a newspaper at the \"Bakeshop\", a tour de force of Czech Wines and digestifs at \"Vinograf\", browsing in the English bookshop (which is more of an international bookshop), to name but a few, and all with the adjacency and views of Charles Bridge. In the back streets of Marla Strana you are unlikely to get chased by ticket sellers or tour advertisers, and will find ample places to strike up interesting conversations, which give one a real flavour of Prague."

I love the wonderful parks with the same old benches, the beautifully restored churches and the many cozy cafes and elegant restaurants.Mala Strana is a very special place for me, place where I grew up and a place that I love to return to every chance I get.

On researching the area, I decided to stay in Mala Strana, also known as Lesser Prague. The area is just a few minutes from Charles Bridge and is a lovely quiet scenic part of Prague. We stayed in the beautiful U Krale Karla Hotel, a four star boutique hotel. Looking at the pictures of the place alone, I was in heaven, an old converted monastery with stained glass windows and frescos on the wall. The reviews said the staff were very friendly and accommodating and we were not disappointed. We booked a taxi through the hotel, which was waiting for us at the airport. We booked our package with Cassidy Travel. I always assumed it would be much cheaper to book the accommodation and flights separately, but Cassidy Travel were much cheaper. We got four days in Prague with Aerlingus Flights in a four star hotel bed and breakfast for 450 for the two of us, amazing value. The only mistake I made really was not booking the transfer with Cassidy Travel as I later found out they do direct transfers to any hotel for 10 euro return.I had read up about the street our hotel was located on Neurodova Street, which was named after a famous poet and had loads of beautiful hotels on it. The sweep from Charles Bridge uphill to Mala Strana and Petrin Hill is truly beautiful with magnificent views from the top of Petrin Hill right down to the bridge and beyond.Hotel U Krale KarlaWe arrived after a 30 minute taxi ride at U Krale Karla. I loved the place immediately. We were welcomed in by a lovely friendly receptionist, who offered us sparkling wine as we filled in our reservation forms, excellent idea! We arrived at our lovely room on the second floor. The whole landing area was so ornate and pretty and our room had a reception area with a couch and coffee table to the front, and then into a quaint room with stained glass windows and beautifully decorated ceiling. The whole atmosphere was wonderful. We had enquired in advance about soya milk and margarine and the hotel told us they would provide same. They did and brought it out to us every morning. We did ask for beans and mushrooms with breakfast, which they also duly provided, though we should have rung ahead about same too. They also had a range of cereals, breads, teas and coffees including decaf coffee, which suited me great. It was a lovely welcoming little room with frescoes on the walls, very cosy. Adela, the receptionist on the second day was the woman who I had made all my enquiries through and like the first receptionist, Martina, she was extremely helpful. They front of house staff are very happy to go through the map with you and make suggestions and are there to answer any enquiries. I fully understand now how people go back to this beautiful hotel time and time again. We certainly would not contemplate staying anywhere else when we return and the area itself is so lovely, just 10 minutes from Charles Bridge, but as you walk past the bridge back into the area, the franticity level goes down a good few notches and so do the prices. A fantastic area and hotel to stay in.We had decided to roam around Mala Strana the first day so we duly unpacked and headed off. We were delighted to find we were right beside the historic castle and a few minutes walk to the bridge. We walked in and soaked up the atmosphere but being naturally nosey, we had to cross that bridge and see what was on the other side. The architecture everywhere is absolutely amazing. I actually cried one night crossing the bridge back to Mala Strana, seeing all the old buildings lit up and just trying to inhale the sheer beauty of the place. Prague cuisine, like most places, is supremely carnist, so we did our research and found some vegi and vegan restaurants. Other than that, we just pottered around the city and decided to stop wherever we felt like. Below are the restaurants and bars we checked out:Lo Veg Mala Strana:On our first night, after walking way further than we intended to, we decided to stay locally for dinner and after a drink at one of the lovely old bars, we headed to this restaurant about two minutes away from our hotel. We were warned about the large amount of stairs to conquer on the way up to the restaurant but braved it nonetheless. This is a fully vegan restaurant, with a terrace that has views of the castle. We reached the top of the stairs and arrived into a lovely relaxing room. We both decided to order two different types of burgers. It was great having so much choice on the menu. We had a bottle of organic wine. Neither of us are into desserts so we were happy with our mains and wine. The food was lovely and there was a nice cocooned atmosphere. Looking back on it, and the other restaurants we tried, I now realise there were better restaurants to go to so I would probably not dignify it with a return visit next time, but it was nice and fully vegan.Maitrea, Old Town:This is a vegetarian restaurant just behind the old town square. I was glad we had looked it up because with so many side streets, it\u2019s not a place we would have necessarily stumbled upon. We were warned you would probably have to book. We had just completed a long tour and were quite whacked so we were having an early dinner before our walk across the bridge and a drink in a local bar. Maitrea is a lovely spacious restaurant. Their sister restaurant Clear Head is also meant to be amazing and housed in an old building further away in Prague. We will definitely try there the next time. We ordered noodle and veg dishes, that came down with abundant rice noodles and veg heavily flavoured with ginger and soya and tofu. The dishes were absolutely beautiful, mouthawateringly fabulous. The bill was very reasonable too.Postel, Old Town:We happened upon this place one day for lunch. It wasn\u2019t vegi or vegan but had plenty of options as they had a lot of Mexican fare. Many of the menus in Prague are the same old goulash rich mush so it was nice to find somewhere different. We decided to order fajitas between us and we were very glad we only ordered one portion as they came down on an enormous sizzling platter with plenty of tortillas, absolutely delish, washed down with a delish Pilsner Urquel. Beer in Prague is very cheap, especially if you go a little away from the old town, check the prices but we were able to get beers for 30 \u2013 40 kronas, approximately 1.20 for a pint.Medieval Tavern, adjacent to the Castle:I absolutely loved this place. Again, we just happened upon it one day whilst walking from Charles Bridge up to the castle. We were enchanted by the place, allegedly Prague\u2019s oldest tavern. It was great fun, all done up with gothic delight, fake spiders and old lanterns everywhere. We were wondering why the staff were banging down the beers and shouting \u201cmore beers\u201d when you finished, until we read the menu and it was a deliberate policy in their endeavour to emulate medieval times. Despite this deliberate brusqueness, the staff were actually really friendly and helpful. We also ordered a vegi platter, which was absolutely delicious, a selection of grilled veg, potatoes, courgettes, aubergines, mushrooms, corn etc, which went down very nicely with ye old beers!!. We had to go back here on our last day as nowhere beat this place for atmosphere and it\u2019s right beside the castle.Mali Buddha, Mala StranaOn our walks around Mala Strana, we ventured up to the wonderful Petrin Hill and soaked in the beauty of all the nearby parks and views of the city. We walked right up to the top of Mala Strana as far as the square and on our way down, saw this restaurant. It was daytime and it was closed and we were checking it out for evening, and noted they had a huge vegi section in their menu. We went back on our last night and we were absolutely amazed when we walked in to the place. It was huge, with candles everywhere and a beautiful aroma of food. We were lucky to get a table. We perused the huge vegetarian menu and when we enquired about vegan options, the waitress told us that all their vegi options were also vegan as they didn\u2019t use dairy or egg. We ordered vegi springrolls to start. They were absolutely amazing, so light and moist, unlike the processed ones that are hard and crusty. We ordered two tofu mains with loads of veg and they were fantastic. The spring rolls also came with rice and veg. The entire meal was amazing and it was our cheapest meal in Prague, starters, mains, sides, wine all for under 30 euro. Exceptional value, amazing food, atmosphere and service. Out of all the places we tried, this is the one I recommend most highly. In fact, it\u2019s one of the best restaurants we have ever eaten in anywhere. Tours:Sandeman\u2019s Free Walking Tour \u2013 I deliberately did not book any tours bar the free walking tour of Prague. There were other tours I had in mind but didn\u2019t want to plan too far. We went on the Sandeman\u2019s Free Walking Tour on our second day. We had walked around a bit beforehand and had lunch in the Mexican-type restaurant and were debating about whether we would go or not as it\u2019s a three hour tour and my hip is bad. However, armed with anti-inflammatories, we decided to brave it and I\u2019m so very glad we did. Sandeman\u2019s meet up in the old market square and can be found under a red umbrella. Our tour guide was Tijo and he was fantastic. The tour was well divided up with a stop at a bar half way through. We were taken all around the old town and new town and then had a break in a local bar and then onto the Jewish Quarter. Tijo had the right balance of being extremely informative and very witty, whilst never being boring or pedantic. The three hours went in a flash and it gave us a brilliant insight into Prague, wherein we wanted to discover more, in our own time. The break enabled us to mingle with the rest of the tourists on the trail and a very nice bunch they were as well. We ended our tour with a talk by the river and I\u2019m so glad we did this tour as it was pivotal to our break. The tours are free but you can tip the guide what you like. Everybody was delighted with the tour and I would definitely go back and pay to go and see various places of interest in the Jewish QuarterSandemans do a range of tours and if Tijo had been doing the castle tour, the next day, I certainly would have availed of same.The Castle - We set off to the castle on our own and decided not to buy the tickets into all the buildings, but to walk around and see them all and walk into the ones that were free of charge or let you walk around to a certain point. There was a huge area to cover dotted with many coffee shops and eateries. The day before we had endeavoured to do same but the president was there giving a speech so we couldn\u2019t access the buildings. On the day in question, we had a coffee outside one and kept walking, so much to see. I will definitely do a more extensive tour of the castle next time but it was a lovely introduction and a beer in the medieval tavern nearby afterwards is mandatory!Boat Trip \u2013 As stated previously, I looked up a good few trips, including one which we will probably do next time, jazz boat trip at night with Prague Experience, they are worth checking out. The thing is when you are walking around all day, you are generally pretty bushed by night time, so I was glad we kept things open. Instead, we decided to play it by ear and we went on a daytime boat trip instead. There were a few to chose from including a boat trip with sailors advertising same that takes you down in a little boat to the Venice of Prague. We decided on the hour long trip down by Kampa River, which took us in a large boat, which served refreshments, very cold, so mulled wine was a great idea, and took us up and down the river to see the main sights of Prague. This was a good trip. Main Sights:The CastleThe Lennon WallSt Nicholas ChurchJewish QuarterCharles BridgePetrin HillStrahov MonasteryThe above are the main sights but really the whole of Prague from Mala Strana through to the old town is like walking into a beautiful fairytale. I have no idea what the shopping is like as I could care less and never looked past the periphery of the new town. So much to see and do. Highly recommended."

This tram goes everywhere, is on time, and easy to \"hop on/ hop off\" and inexpensive,too! We rode this to the cemetary to find my husband's ancestors, to the Lesser Quarter, and all the way out to the big Tesco store, about 25 minutes out of the city, and back again. You'll enjoy the Lesser Quarter, as it is not as touristy, and there are many good restaurants here; bring some CZK cash, in case they don't take credit cards."

We spent 5 days walking and tramming around the city, and even in high season, it was always a pleasant relief to get back across the frenetic, packed Charles Bridge, and into Mala Strana.It's well populated with shops, restaurants, cafes and the usual beautiful buildings that Prague is famous for, but significantly much less busy, quieter, and you can therefore stroll around without feeling like part of a herd of Wildebeest. We even felt perfectly safe walking through the area late at night, as it's well-lit and not the slightest bit threatening.The area is well served by trams, so you can hop on in the morning, and get to wherever you're spending the rest of your day, just yards from your hotel. You're also close to the main road (Karmelitska/Ujezd) which runs down in line with the river and will take you past the huge hillside park where you can pick up the funicular up to the observation tower, and (after a walk) the Castle area. You can essentially stroll all the way down to Most Legii (the bridge with an island in the middle), and from here, get a tram or walk across to Narodni, and ultimately Wenceslas square.In summary, if you want to be based conveniently close to the action, but in a quieter, less hectic and \"touristy\" district, this is a good choice."

You get great views of the river and old town too, especially from Prague Castle and Petrin Hill (If you climb the tower). Prague Castle is reveiwed elsewhere. Sometimes it is good to get away from all the entertainment (especially on Charles Bridge or in Old Town), I kept thinking lesser town, e.g around Bretislavoa and Trziste would make an excellent film set with narrow cobbled streets and few cars (but no photos near the american Embassy).Cannot think of anything to dislike."

The #22 bus goes right through here and you will probably see a lot of it on your way to and from the Castle and the Royal Summer House; but it is worth a few hours to wander around the area cause it is very pleasing to the eye. Maybe when you walk across Charles Bridge, you continue on through the \"Lesser\" area and return via the Legionaru Bridge; or the other way around, if you are staying on the Castle side of the city. Tip; stay on the #22 bus right to the end and you will see Prague surburban life and at the Terminus, walk 100 metres further on and look at the ancient Monastery [ hopefully it is open ] called Poutni Cesta Hajko which is one of the few \"Pilgrimage\" churches and Stations of the cross, surviving in the old Communist Bloc; stations are set two kms apart and are being restored by the Government and assistance from the EU . Locals still attend their services here and it is quite atmospheric."

The castle and cathedral are on the Lesser Town side . Easy to walk to , although there were quite a few stairs. The Lesser town is close to the Charles Bridge , Kafka Museum too . While walking through the Lesser town one afternoon we noticed a doorway through which people were entering and exiting . My hubby suggested we check it out . To our delight we discovered the Senate gardens . It was a gorgeous little jewel of a place. The gardens were gorgeous and well maintained. Would recommend it . The Castle and Cathedral are also a must on your have to go places. You have incomparable views of the whole of Prague from atop the hill . The castle has beautiful spaces and gardens which you could spend a day roaming through .The cathedral is gorgeous but very busy with tourists , we much preferred roaming though the International gardens and eventually ending up in a park which took us back to the old town .The Lennon tribute wall is a fun place to visit . Great , colorful photo opportunities . We were lucky to be there when the Prague \"Rent\" cast did a video promo at the wall . It added to the great vibe of the place. Kafka's museum was more serious and dark but an interesting place to visit . Lots to do and see in Lesser Town ! Best place to stay in my opinion . Our stay at the Aria hotel was sublime !"

There is always something to see here, including some very quiet neighborhoods and many parks. You can walk up Petrine Hill to get a great view of the city or take the funicular to the tower. Trams run from MalaStranska, and Old Town is literally across the Charles Bridge, about 5 blocks, depending on where you stay in the neighborhood. Embassy Row was at our backs, with its patina of quiet refinement. If this is too challenging for the urban traveler, you can just head for the Charles Bridge at any time of night or day-throbbing with vendors and tourists the only time all is quiet is early morning;Prague begins at 10."

They explained the genesis of the building to me when I was chatting to them. They offered to book the ballet for me the next time we visited. I enjoyed they're sweetie dish when I passed reception. We had exceptional views of the Castle, St Nicholas's and other business buildings. The Beer Museum was on the same block at the end of the road. There are many attractive shops housed within arches and protected with strong heavy wooden doors. Really different and many types of crystal, sparkle, art and creativity. We crossed St Charles's Bridge at least twice a day and I loved it every time I had different panoramic views.

Cross the Charles Bridge and walk up Nerudova street, it was called the Royal Way in the old days. Its steep so its tiring and not for the faint hearted or mobility challenged. In peak season its busy and its only got one way traffic so its busy but great vies from the Palace ones you make it to the top. There are lots of places to stop and have a coffee if you need a rest. I prefer off peak season, its much easier to walk around."

Malostranske namesti is the main town square surrounding the St.Nicolas Church with its famous Tiffany blue dome, which serves as the logical starting point for any tour of the Lesser Quarter due to its location; at the top of the hill just north sits the Prague Castle (Prazsky Hrad), to the south is Petrin Hill and its tower overlooking the city, and to the east is the Charles Bridge. Mostecka, the road from the Charles Bridge leading up to St.Nicolas Church, has been hailed as one of the most colorful streets in the world, which you'll quickly discover as you make your way into the heart of Mala Strana. Shops, restaurants, and cobbled roads with narrow alleys make this neighborhood the soul of Prague, while the Old Town is the history of Prague. This is a must-see on your visit to this city."

It's hilly and there are trams (too confusing to contemplate, for me) to get to both, and also a fleet of vintage cars with drivers for personal tours of these places as well as the other side of the bridge and around the rest of the city. They're not super cheap, but won't break the bank either.

I was born and raised here, and can't think of a better place in the world to grow up in. The view of the river and the National Theater from our windows was hard to beat, the parks nearby- Petrin and Kampa were our backyard. Detsky ostrov -Childrens Island and Strelecky ostrov - Shooters Island and Zofin Island were favorite places to visit. There are many beautiful churches, among them Prazske Jezulatko and the baroque church St. Nicholas, Loreta, and of course the famous St. Vitus Cathedral and and the St. George Basilica.The many boutique hotels make the visit to the Castle and Charles bridge a very easy one. I love the manicured gardens Vrtbovska and Waldstejnska, and the gardens right below the Castle. The many restaurants that have been in the same place for years and the new ones too. The beautiful houses in Mostecka and Nerudova streets. The Funicular at the base of The Petrin Hill. The cobblestone streets. The amazing views of Prague. Mala Strana is my favorite place to stay when I come back home to Prague."

It is in fact a larger area than most people realise and it covers different styles of architecture although I would say that the area immediately to the left and right of Nerudova are the most picturesque as well as the most visited. For those who remember the film Amadeus about Mozart: quite a lot of footage was shot in the small archways leading off the square in front of Sv Micklase (Nicholas) Church and further towards the top of the hill, to the left of the Hrad (Castle). By the end of September several rather rude and impatient waiters were to be found in the restaurants and cafes lining the Nerudova, so it was nicer to walk into the more quite and equally beautiful side streets. Also the prices went down. Loads of gorgeous palaces owned by the aristocracy of the Habsburg Empire, now every so often turned into embassies."

Located below Prague Castle, it's an easy downhill walk from the castle area, and leads to the famous, 14th century Charles Bridge. The buildings in Mala Strana are the oldest in all Prague. Now, beautifully restored to their historic splendour, many will awe you with their art work and statuary. This area is also the site of the John Lenon Memorial Wall, and of numerous boutique hotels, restaurants and coffee shops. If you choose to partake of these however, be prepared to pay almost the Paris- level price. The crowds can be overwhelming in summer. Consider an early-morning, or late afternoon stroll, or visit in the off-season for a more relaxed experience.Peter and Gaye. Victoria, B.C., Canada"

While other areas of Prague have given themselves over to commerce and relevant / irrelevant commercialism, Mala Strana keeps its own counsel , remaining serene & mysterious even as tourists pour down its main artery, Neru Dova street. This is an area for exploring stairways, alleys and side-streets just to see where they go. Sometimes, what appears to be a small place from the street, can open into a large subterranean space inside. We adopted as our starting point the overlook at Prague castle. A cascade of red-tiled roofs drops to the spires and domes of St Nicholas and the church of Our lady Victorious, and beyond .... half of the eastern side of the city is visible. Down a short cobble-stoned length of Ke Hradu, followed by a hairpin turn to the left and you find yourself at Nervdova, an appealing mix of shops and restaurants and palaces. At the bottom of the hill, Nervdova opens into a large square, home to the Performing Arts Academy where we were treated to a lunchtime concert. Onto St Nicholas church which is very beautiful, after which lunch was the order of the day under the colonnade. Working off lunch was easy with Wallenstein Gardens, aviary, fountains leading to Wallenstein Palace, a massive Romanesque and baroque confection housing parliament. Our journey wend towards Kafka's Museum, after which it was time to spend the arvo exploring the riverside walk."

We stayed in this area and it was perfect, as it was close to plenty of restaurants, great attractions, and most importantly, away from all the crowds and noise. Make sure to visit the Lennon Wall, as it is living art, representing the Czech people\u2019s desire for freedom. John never lived in Prague, but the ever changing wall became a symbol of hope. Bring a marker with you as you can actually draw or write on the wall. If you are lucky, you might find a musician playing Beatle songs. The Lennon wall is close to Prague Castle, the St. Charles Bridge, and Old Town Square, so there is plenty to do after visiting this beautiful work of art."

Many tourists who come for a short visit often miss out spending time here as they are concentration on Old Town square.The ancient houses are really nice and most hotels are set in ancient buildings.Many people prefer staying here as it is quieter and more beautiful than other parts of the town. The side roads are cobbled and I was told that a visit at night will make you feel as if you are in ancient Prague as these cobbled lanes are lantern lit. The churches, the cafes, the pubs and the atmosphere make this side of Prague a lovely area to take a stroll and have a meal.If you walk from Old Town square, you can reach here in just 15 minutes.Once you are at the Mala Strana square you can walk on the delightful Nerudova Street up which you can walk to reach the castle district, the Church of St. Nicholas, Petrin Hill, and the Wallenstein Gardens.The residential area is not very far as you walk in this area of Mala Strana. The houses are lovely and one would be much better off coming here to the restaurants for nice meals. The Old town is a tourist trap and though the atmosphere is good, the food is very mediocre at a very hefty price. Here, you would get great food at half the price !While you are there, don't miss the John Lennon wall !"

On the other side of Mala Strana is the Castle District. You have great views of the castle from Mala Strana. Our only regret was that we only had a day in Prague, and didn't get to see everything. Our tour guide started our journey in the Castle District. It was perfect for my 80+ year old mother. Our walk through Prague was all a physical down hill trek from that point. Mala Strana played a great role that day. It ended up being more of a rest spot for us in between the castle and Old Town. Our guide took us to Restaurant U Glaubicu in Mala Strana square where we had a traditional Czech meal. It was a wonderful local experience that we will never forget. This part of town provided a great diversion from all the touristy parts of town. This is also where we sampled our first taste of Becherovka. That little shot of local liqueur kept us going as we crossed over the Charles Bridge into Old Town. I'd imagine it keeps everyone warm in the winter months. Don't hesitate to book a hotel here if you like to be in a calmer place (away from the masses of people)."

It's Cathedrals, Concert Halls, narrow old cobble-stone streets, towers, exquisite as well as 'take-out' restaurants, bakeries, & spires, as well as it's many shops, make it a great place to visit. Combine this with the Old Historic area across the Charles Bridge, & it's difficult to envison a more enjoyable city in Europe to visit. p.s. as we left Prague at 4:30 a.m, the streets were filled with the young crowd finishing up the night. Prague has a very lively night life!"

Start in the square outside the castle and walk across to the wall which overlooks the city - a wonderful view (if the weather is good) and it's free! Then take the road down to the right - its quite steep and the cobbles can be slippery in wet/icy weather.This will take you down into Nerudova where you can wander gently down the hill. When you reach Malostranska Square, do go into the church of St Nicholas - a riot of Baroque decoration ( there is an admission charge) and then continue on down Mostecka which will bring you down to the Charles Bridge. On your way down from the castle, explore the side streets - some hidden gems of buildings and palaces, and some friendly little cafes and restaurants. A lovely area and well worth exploring."

I visited the Gingerbread museum almost daily and even brought home a tupperware full of cookies for my kids (also there's a great ATM right outside of here that has a great exchange rate). There were so many areas that were secluded but occasionally I'd wander into a crowd of tourists and duck down another path that led to a beautiful vista or a quaint alleyway restaurant full of flowers and colors.

It is more quiet here.You just have to cross the Charles Bridge (or another) to get to the Old Town. It is actually not important if you stay here or in the Old Town, because you will walk through both quarters every day...If you need some sport, go to nearby \"Letna hill\" or \"Landronka park\", where is possibility of running, skateboarding or inline skating.

Mala Strana, also referred to as the \"Lesser Town\" or \"Lesser Quarter\" is one of the ten listed old districts of Prague. It is located just past Charles Bridge and encompasses much of the area between the banks of the Vltava River and the Castle District. It is a place that Mozart and Casanova loved and are rumoured to have spent much time during their days in Prague, and it is a lovely and quaint area to explore and experience for today's visitors to the city. As you enter Mala Strana, from Charles Bridge you are immediately met with what has become a rather touristy scene on Nerodova street. Fast food eateries, souvenir shops and the likes now dominate what used to be a very charming scene in the past. However, Nerodova remains an attractive thoroughfare and as soon as you get off the main street, you can quickly find yourself in cobblestone passages and places that feel much more authentic, genuine and what you were probably hoping to experience in Prague. In addition to the quaint alleys and tiny streets you can experience while wondering through Mala Strana, there are several garden/park areas, which are beautiful during much of the year. There are countless places to stop for a drink or meal, a couple of good museums, including the popular Franz Kafta Museum, which also boast a very interesting statue creation by David Cerny called - Piss. You'll just have to see this one for yourself, its actually quite interesting. Mala Strana also hosts two very good church visits that can be made and which are highly recommendable. These include the the church of St. Nicolas which is arguably amongst Europe's more attractive Baroque style churches that also features the largest ceiling fresco in the continent. Further, you can visit the Our Lady of Victorious church, which hosts the Jesus Child statue, an important local relic that has been visited by worshippers and visitors the world over as well as having recorded three papal visits since the1890s. Overall, Mala Strana, while having become quite touristy in parts, is probably our favourite area in Prague and an area we will purposely spend more time during future trips to the city."

While it might not have the grandeur of the Old Town across the river, many find it more charming. Because the area was razed by fires in the 16th century, the architecture here is mainly baroque. Its finest site is the Wallenstein Palace with its fabulous walled garden full of fountains and statues. There's also the Church of Saint Nicholas and, high on Pet\u0159\u00edn Hill, a miniature replica of the Eiffel Tower.The Lesser Quarter is fun place to hang out if you don't want to do anything else for the day, you'll find music playing, people dancing, brides/ grooms have their wedding photo taking around and about the square, ..etc. You also find fine dinning with reasonable price at the square, the food cooked to perfection, but beware the tip - some restaurant added tips but some place tips are not included (check your bill carefully for tips before you leave the restaurant or the manager will come after you if you forgot to pay tips LOL)"

But the west side is so quaint, quiet, peaceful....what a difference from the east side. It all depends what you are looking for. If you enjoy nightlife, clubs, people, stay on the east side. If you are looking for a peaceful oasis after a day of touring, the Lesser Quarter is awesome."

Easy tram ride from the train station, it's a lovely, quiet and very elegant area of the city. Below the castle, it's at the western end of Charles Bridge and the home to many embassies and beautiful buildings. Quite a few nice restaurants and bars. Be sure to take in Petrin Hill and the Novy Svet (new world) area as well. Just walk about and explore, it's a wonderful area to wander. I recommend walking up Trziste past both the American and German embassies and up the stairs to the Strahov Monastery, by Loreta and then to the castle and St Vitus. Absolutely stunning architecture and great views of the red roofs of Mala Strana."

Lovely part of Prague, with the castle being a must visit in this traditional part of the city.If you can muster the energy, then walking to the top of Petrin Hill and climbing to the top of the observation tower is a great way of spending an hour or so, with beautiful gardens to see whilst being there. For the less mobile there's a tram that you can get at the metro stop Ujezd at the bottom of the hill for 32CK - a bargain!!!There are plenty of bars/traditional restaurants and shops in this area, with the odd tourist exchange thrown in for good measure - be aware of being approached by strangers in the street offering you a great deal on currency exchange - this is a problem that we faced on most days but a firm 'no' usually did the trick, although the hubby had to be quite insistent on a few occasions.All in all a beautiful area with lots to see and do. You won't regret giving it a whirl!"

There are many shops, restaurants and sights to see there. You should walk along the river for a great view of the Old Town from the other side of the river and then enjoy the Lesser Quarter with all it has to offer. It is best to allow about half a day for this area and like the Old Town, allow yourself just to wander not staying just on the main more busy streets.We stumbled upon a Thai massage down a minor road and for 350 czk each (USD 17.50) we had an absolutely heavenly and relaxing 20 minute foot massage that was worth every bit of what we paid and more!Experiences like these cannot be planned. Just let yourself go where your feet direct and you will have a terrific day and an authentic experience."

Kampa is a beautiful little island with a park that is lovely to walk through and is located at the bottom of the steps as you near the end of the bridge to your left (if coming from old town). Also, if you have time it is worth renting a bike or taking a bike tour to Petrin park and Petrin Hill. The trail is well paved and the views are beautiful. You can also see the monastery. At the top is a beautiful rose garden....it is an elevation so good shoes and healthy knees required!"

A few metres along Karmelitska, just past Trziste (excuse the lack of accents, Czech speakers!) and an unimposing lane leads you into a restored Baroque garden, a haven of peace and tranquility, with terraces leading you up to a fine view of the city and beyond.Walk up Triste and past the American Embassy: you can lose yourself in the little maze of quiet streets that run parallel to the busy Nerudova which carries the tourist up to the castle. Here you can find little restaurants, imposing hotels, beautiful former palaces and, eventually, make your way up the hill to Petrin, the fading but still fascinating park.Petrin houses small treasures, like the hall of mirrors and diarama, and an observatory, as well as a smaller version of M. Eiffel's tower. It even has a funicular railway to whizz you back to reality!On your way there look round the back of the German Embassy where they still display the Golden Trabi (that's one for you to research!). And keep an eye out for Dum U Velke Boty, a rare, quirky, traditional and original guest house on the square opposite the German Embassy. From Petrin you can easily access the Strahov Monastery, and from Vlasska a ramble through a little maze of streets will bring you back to Nerudova and the crowds. If it gets a little too quiet, head for Malostanske Namesti, the busy square surrounding St Nicholas Cathedral. Lift your eyes up from street level and admire the fantastic and beautiful architecture. Prepare to be over-awed!"

We stayed in Smichov (cheaper) but walked or took the tram up there several times, wish we'd had much more time to explore!"

It can be a little overwhelming at times. However, the Lesser Quarter is a nice change of pace. It's peaceful, quiet, and just as beautiful but without the crowds! We wandered over here after visiting the John Lennon Wall and I'm so glad we spent some time on this side of the Charles Bridge. It quickly became one of our favorite parts of visiting Prague. There are parks, flowing streams, colorful pastel buildings, cafes, and cobblestone streets. We spent a few hours one afternoon just wandering around and taking it all in. I suggest seeing the unique \"bridge of love locks\" as well as the John Lennon Wall while you're in this area."

The church was built in the early 1700's in the Baroque style. Pictures are allowed in this cathedral. Secondly, go to the lesser known KGB Museum located a block from the U.S. Embassy. For a family of 2 adults and 2 students it was 660 CZK total and it was well worth it. The owner/collector gives a wonderfully informative guided tour as part of the price. There are so many authentic pieces such as guns, uniforms, Lenin's death face mask, knives, and spy equipment there. Some are not behind glass, and the owner will let you touch/hold them."

Tram 22 is ubiquitous, usually packed and the lifeblood of the area. Get a 24 hour pass for buses, trams and Metro to hop on and off at each stop to discover new bits and get another scenic view of the castle, river and environs. It changes daily."

Whilst the Castle, Charles Bridge and the Mostecka are always packed from around 9.30am onwards, just metres away are some very good places to stay and eat and drink, that are not packed with the usual tourist tat and overpriced dross. Though generally slightly more expensive than the Old and New Town areas, the quality, generally is superior enough to justify it. It became our favourite area of the whole city, with unexpected discoveries in all sorts of nooks as well as the more famous ones dotted around. The perfect place to base yourself in the city and if you do spend an evening in the Old or New Town, the perfect walk back to where you are staying over the incredible Charles Bridge."

Plenty of shops, cafes, restaraunts, bars, currencty conversion desks. Tram runs through the town, streets are clean, subtle police presence - you never feel threatened or insecure. Prices are very reasonable everywhere, my wife commented she couldnt believe how cheap Prague is (eating, drinking etc). It's almost as if the Czech's undersell the beauty, mystique and wonder that Prague offers. Only tip - look out for dodgy taxi's (like every city has). My advice - stick to the 'AAA' taxis - they have a '14xxx' phone number on the side - they are clean, safe and fully licensed - average fair for 10 minutes about $10 aussie dollars. English understood in 90% of places - even if it isnt, staff are always happy to help overcome and mis-understandings. Mala Strana is a great place to stay and start your love affair with Prague"

Most everyone comes to Prague and sees the castle and of course walks to Charles Bridge --- but do make sure to take at least a half hour or so and walk around the bridge ---- to see the often overlooked sites in the Lesser Quarter - Mala Strana. You can see St. Nicolas Church, St. Thomas Church and the Infant Jesus of Prague --- all of which are within 5 min of Charles Bridge. But you can also drop by to see the Knights of Malta's church of Our Lady Under the Chain and the Grand Prior's Palace --- both next to each other and 1 min from Charles bridge. Steeped in history, the Knights of Mala have had a continuous existence here in Prague for over 800 years !!! "

There are some really great shops with authentic Czech souvenirs and crafts of lesser price and higher quality that Old Town. Less bustle. Malostrenka Pivnice is HUGE and has great food, beer and service and takes up almost a whole block. You have to also go by the Kafka Museum and Cerny's statue of two men peeing. Very fun. The John Lennon wall is very close to the main drag."

            "review": "a place to walk around and enjoy. Mala Strana - The Lesser Quarter is a historic part of town which is less crowded and less expensive than the other side. The main square - Malostranske namesti, is surrounded by a number of restaurants where you can have a very nice meal, and also great coffee.I got lost a few times in the streets which often turn out to be dead ends, but It was not an unpleasant experience. Somehow or other you will always turn up at the main square. if you like to walk around a city, just to get a feel of the atmosphere, without any particular sightseeing, this is a very good place to do it."

This neighborhood is full of small shops and smaller streets, cafes, embassies, cafes, and squares. St. Nicholas Church and the Church of Our Lady Victorious are both in this neighborhood. We especially liked Nerudova Street- it's a good little hike with lots of cool buildings and shops to admire along the way, many with the famous pictures over the doors. At the top is a cafe (something like the Golden Star?) that is perfect for watching tourists come down from the castle while sipping Pilsner and yumming down some fried cheese. :)"

I booked a very clean hotel via a Czech agency, we were extremely pleased with the accomodations, the area, and the city. The people are a little more cool and quiet than other Europeans, but they are helpful. I'm going back in 2 wks with my mother and we will stay in Mala Strana District again."
