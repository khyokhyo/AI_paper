For the adults, there are many restaurants and bars, IMAX cinema, a marina and a marvelous surrounding. Once you go to Darling Harbour, you\u2019ll want to go back time after time."

We were sorely disappointed. The area around the harbor is wall-to-wall restaurants. There were some shops at Harbourside, nothing special. The Maritime Museum certainly has its worth if that is what you are looking for. The Star is a great place to go if you'd like to lose some money gambling, its a huge casino. The IMAX theater is closed for renovation until 2019!! I think some tradesmen are getting paid by the hour there. Don't waste your time. There are better things to do in Sydney."

If you're visiting Sydney then make sure you spend some time enjoying all that Darling Harbour has to offer - I don't think you'll be disappointed.

Travelling with kids, we focussed on the southern end of the precinct for wandering around. The kids playground is fun for kids aged 2 - 10ish. There is also a fun water park with water trails and a splash pad. My two (7 & 10) enjoyed this the most and would have spent hours there if we'd had that time. Tip: chuck a couple of small towels into your day pack so that wet kids don't hold you up. We visited the Chinese Gardens (excellent), Harbourside (don't bother), walked across the Pyrmont Bridge (very good), went to the Aquarium (ok) and the Wild Life Zoo (ok), caught the light rail from Paddy's Market to the casino and walked back to the city. We also came back on Saturday night at 8.30 to see the free fireworks and enjoy the free street entertainers, which was well worth it.Not sure that I would agree that Darling Harbour is a \"must visit\" and if you only have a short time in the city, there are better ways to see the harbour and city, however the kids enjoyed their time in the play area and Chinese Gardens, so would recommend those areas to families travelling to Sydney."

Enjoyable, easy walk right around. Visit the Maritime museum and purchase tickets to go on 4 ships. There are plenty of bars and restaurants all around to choose from, both out on the deck and inside the Harbourside building There is construction underway on the new International Conference centre The best part for families and people just visiting has to be the big firework display every Saturday night at 20:30, this attracts thousands of people and it a great show.Tranport by light rail and ferry. Imax, Aquarium, Chinese Friendship Garden all close by. As well as several types of speciality shops inside, So something for all kinds of weather"

They also have some fun cruises leaving from there, and they attract some very classy dressed locals, so you can enjoy some people watching. And there are more formal attractions like wax or maritime museums. And, by the way, this area maybe not as recognizable as the Sydney Harbor, it still looks and feels great."

I am confident the finished product will be a wonderful experience. It is easy to see this is a major attraction already and with the new development it's going to be a knock out, I am looking forward to coming back to see it when it is finished. Just to clarify I am of pensionable age but I had a ball with the completed water feature that has channelled waterways with locks that could be opened and diverters to alter the direction of the water flow and these quirky spiral water elevators or water pumps, I can imagine the kids having an absolute ball with these, we did. I am told the old water feature has been filled in, which is a pity as this was also good fun, hopefully it will be replaced with something equally enjoyable. Darling harbour is always going to be a magnet for tourists or even locals and there is so much to do there, you would need three days to do it justice with the Aquarium, The Maritime Museum, The Chinese Garden and whatever else they build into the new complex. Good job there are so many restaurants and cafes there to cater for your hunger doing all these things."

A cultural melting pot of cuisine so there is choice for fast food to quality dining options and attractions for the young and old.

There's a Sea World here, Madame Tussauds and Australian Wildlife exhibit here (not the real name, but that escapes me). We didn't do these but really wanted to. Time was an issue for us. The food places looked good and we did note that they were not as expensive as Sydney Harbour. If we went back to Sydney again, I'd spend a full weekend here."

During an evening trip to photograph the Sydney Opera House, a friendly family on vacation told me about some fireworks at Darling Harbour. I wasn't quite sure where that was, but I figured if I followed the waterfront, I would find it eventually.It took me longer than it would have had I simply asked for directions, but I was looking for a bit of an adventure. I arrived right as the fireworks were started. There was a a bridge packed with people for the show. It was short, but spectacular. After that, I walked around and Darling Harbour is a happening place full of shopping and restaurants. I made a second trip back during the day there is plenty to do. It would be easy to spend a whole day between the shops, attractions and restaurants."

The darling Harbour is ti me one of the best scenic attraction in Sydney. Simply you will find almost anything you are looking for. The natural surrounds, jet so tp speak fenced in by the harbour and enhanced through the architecture that has been added, gives this place it never ending charm. Walking along the key's with their offerings on one side the harbour and boots big and small, you can take one of them for a sight seeing trip on the harbour, or join in and have a drink or a meal in one of the many restaurants and bars on the way. A cocktail here, and entree there and perhaps a meal some place else. The restaurants cater for any taste you will not be disanointed. ( and may I say they cater for any budged as well ) We love this kind of eating out, sitting outside and watch the world go by. Often - on weekends Sydney but on a splendid fireworks display in the evening, you can hear the aahhh's nd ohhh's from everywhere. You can walk up and over to the bridge that is close by and see Sydney's old jet most photographed attraction, the Sydney Harbour Bidge ( the big one ) visible from everywhere near the Harbour. If you have the energy to walk further to the \"Rocks\" The excess to that bridge is near by. A casual walk (free) over the bridge gives you a fantastic look over Sydney either side and plenty of photo opportunity.There is a charming little place on the other end where you can get some refreshments before you go back, or take the train back to Circular Key.However, going back on foot to the area called the \"Rocks\", you find plenty to see eat and drink. A truly multicultural area that offers a taste for everyone. Including a German Beer and a Bratwurst or other many culinary specialities. Finger licking goodHave a go! ps lets not forget the art gallrieas in that area and the fantastic old buildings with historyyou can ask any shopkeeper about the history within."

This place is full of awesome restaurants and the Sydney Aquarium and Museum is right there as well and only just a quick walk to the city centre to shop so a great place to stay near.You are only a stones through from China town for a great massage and it is a great central location, I always stay right near Darling Harbour as it is just amazing and with the new convention centre being built right there it is going to be great.If your at a convention at Australian Technology Park you are only a 45min walk from Darling Harbour or a $10-$15 Uber ride.I love shopping at Queen Victoria Centre, Myer Centre & Westfield and it is only a short walk to Darling Harbour for dinner or lunch after shopping."

That's two attractions where you can spend half a day before browsing the plethora of shops prior to having a bite to eat at one of the many cafes and restaurants available - something for all budgets.Seek out the Chinese Garden for a touch of tranquility and then head for the Imax Theatre for a dose of escapism. Go for a boat ride.Alternatively, you can just amble around at your own pace to soak up the atmospher and admire the views, especially the city skyline."

It also provides a great spot to sit and watch what's happening around Darling Harbour. There's plenty to see and do around Darling Harbour, so plan to make a day of it (especially as the Sydney Aquarium, Madame Tussauds, the IMAX theatre and the Chinese Garden of Friendship are all located within this vicinity). And if you don't feel like doing touristy things, there are plenty of cafes/restaurants to satisfy hungry and thirsty travellers!"

Lunch times and evenings are truly bustling. Just one little point - breakfasts were advertised at many venues but even at 8am none were open to cater for the many hungry people already thronging even then in search of food."

It's home to SeaLife and the wildlife zoo, also the Hard Rock Cafe. The shopping is good and there are usually many awesome attractions around the harbour, such as a Ferris wheel and ice skating. Amazing place!"

It's close enough to the CBD to walk, but fantastic views, atmosphere and less frantic pace. The Harbourside Mall is quite large and I quite happily spent a couple hours looking through the stores. Lots of fantastic places to eat all around Darling Harbour! The biggest problem is choosing a place each night!There's a great fireworks display which I believe usually happens each Saturday night - truly stunning and an unexpected highlight.Will definitely enjoy getting back to Darling Harbour on my next trip."

There are still plenty of restaurants, an IMAX theatre, interesting shopping, museums, nice hotels and views across the water to the Sydney city skyline. However a good part of the Darling Harbour complex is presently under a major reconstruction. Never being satisfied with the not so old buildings, ameneties and Convention centre the powers that be have deemed it necessary to add huge new buildings which are going to take a long while to complete. Therefore a good part of Darling Harbour has been closed off and will be for some time, so visitors will be subjected to noise, detours of walkways and the eyesores that come with new construction work and hoardings for quite a while yet. At the opposite end of the harbour, construction will soon commence on the building of a new casino. Best come when all this is finished unless decisions are made for more \"enhancements\"."

It is also home to most of the river cruise and dinner cruise ships that operate in Sydney Harbour and the close sea shore. The area is kept clean, there are free public rest rooms (with toilet paper) and it is very relaxing to stroll with all the other tourists and locals along the quay."

Additionally it is short walking distance to other attractions like seaworld and the ferry towards circular quay (near the opera house) and other destinations around Sydney harbour. We were there during the Vivid lightshow and the Darling harbour lights were fantastic. Additionally fireworks occur every Saturday evening I'm told, and we really enjoyed that on our trip. It does get very crowded in the evening due to the various nightclubs in the area, however adds to jovial atmosphere. Must visit."

There is life everywhere at Darling Harbour because they have centralised so much there. The science buffs get the Powerhouse Museum nearby ( Melbournes Scienceworks is on the other side of the Westgate Bridge in the suburbs). Sydney's aquarium is here ( ours in on the river near an already thriving area near the Casino instead of the lifeless Docklands). Darling Harbour has the Maritime Museum, the Wildlife Experience and Madam Tussauds, a brilliant children's playground, the Chinese Garden, IMAX ( Melbournes is in the Museum nowhere near the docks) and consistently busy restaurants because of a dynamic harbour experience. There's something for everyone and a must see in Sydney."

My recommendation, catch the ferry from Circular Quay which passes the Opera House on the right, then goes under the Harbour Bridge. It takes no more than 15 minutes and you are at Darling Harbour.There are lots of shops and restaurants which I feel are overrated and expensive.

However, you can catch the light rail from Central Station and alight at Pyrmont Bay. This will direct you in Harbourside Mall and you can also visit the nearby Star Mall and Casino. Coming from Circular Quay, you can catch the Sydney ferry and alight at the Darling Harbour stop.For kid friendly attractions, Darling Harbour is perfect. There is a park in Darling Quarter, Maritime Museum is beside the shopping centre, IMAX is centrally located and Madame Tussauds, Wildlife Sydney Zoo and the Sydney aquarium are just right adjacent to each other.

Have a meal there - the restaurants are fabulous, overlooking the water and there is plenty of fast food venues if you want a cheap snack. Shopping is good for tourists but the best part is just sitting, overlooking the yachts, and just people watching. It's lots of fun."

It is a mecca for business lunches on weekdays with so many restaurants catering for group bookings. The shopping centre on the western side of Pyrmont Pedestrian Bridge, is filled with tourist shops and eateries and with the occasional opening of Pyrmont Bridge and the very interesting Maritime Museum, definitely worth a visit. The south eastern side of Darling Harbour has the Imax theatre, a huge screen for monumental movies. The restaurants on the eastern side a cut above other main stream eateries, great for lunch or dinner. Also on the eastern side of the water, you have the Sydney Aquarium, the Australian Zoo and Madam Tussaud's Wax Museum, great for kid's entertainment and the real attraction of Darling Harbour for kids. With the Maritime Museum on the other side of the water, Darling Harbour is a must see area for visiting families."

After sunset, when the lights are on all the high rise modem buildings and the giant Ferris wheel, the harbor dazzles. When we were there, the Sydney Vivid event was going on. There were water/fire shows at the harbor every night from 6:00 pm onward. There was fabulous firework display on Saturday night. It is a busting place day and night. Definitely worth a visit."

There's even a food court in the harbour side mall. Definite must in your travel itinerary during the Vivid Sydney. Darling harbour looks beautiful in the day as well with all the private yachts parked at the harbour. Lots of attractions for kids as well like the sea aquarium. Madame Tussaud's, wildlife sanctuary like the lovely Ferris wheel. I would recommend taking the Ferris wheel in the night to enjoy the vivid lights & fireworks if you time it right.

We did not go into any of the attractions or museums but just walked around and spent a lot of time in the children's park - which was fantastic! There's carousal rides and water fountains and many little spaces for kids to hang around. We ended up spending most of the day there outdoors and it was a lovely sunny day experience!"

My visit to Darling Harbour (as my husband had other commitments) was a most enjoyable experience. I walked from our hotel and crossed various walkways to get to the Harbour. The sights of the harbour were amazing and I had lunch at a restaurant which was the most amazing fish and chips whilst enjoying watching the people passing by. I then visited the aquarium (as I had not seen one for a long, long time) which was fantastic. This amazing experience took over an hour and I am glad that I decided to take the time. I loved it!!"

Work has been relentless over the past 2+ years with the demolition and reconstruction of both the Exhibition Halls and Convention Centre - the new ones, nearing completion, will be magnificent venues adding to the energy of this area I'm certain.

Of course, the bridge and the Harbour together makes the iconic view of Sydney, just now people don't go there chill and relax. If it's your first time in Sydney, still worth going!And don't miss the fireworks on every Sat night! :)"

Its like a big playground, with shopping and eateries added on for a total experience. On the day we visited, we were caught on the bridge in a flash downpour, but that didn't dampen our spirits ( forgive the pun). We headed for the food court, did some browsing and shopping under cover and when the sun came out, we strolled around the Harbour, enjoying the display of hilarious street and information signs. A leisurely walk brought us to the Chinese Gardens, and then to Paddy's Market...which is a review for another time. darling harbour is easily reached on foot, take the train to Town Hall, walk down Market street past The Queen Victoria Building ( another review coming for the QVB), or take a bus, or ferry from Circular Quay. Lots of good weather activities at the massive children's playground, or if you need an activity forrainy days, head to the Aquarium, Wild World or Madame Tussauds. Fabulous restaurants offering a variety of cuisines, including fine dining face onto the Harbour. Cruises for lunch or dinner leave from here to explore Sydney Harbour. So MUCH to do and see. Go There! Cheers!"

Plenty of attractions like museums, aquariums, cruises and eateries.There was an Indonesia fare during our visit and we enjoyed the entertainment and food served.Very accessible if staying within the CBD."

We caught a ferry from Sydney Harbor which only took a few minutes. It was very convenient because we could use the same Opal card we used on the buses.We stopped for a cup of cappuccino and a pastry just after getting off the ferry at one of the many cafes. As you walk along the harbor there is so much to see. We stopped at the zoo for a while then continued our walk along the harbor. There is a large shopping mall where we visited a few stores and purchased some things. Longing for some oriental food, we stopped at an Asian noodle restaurant. The food was great and I wished we had one of these back home in Maui, Hawaii."

We choose a cool little restaurant for lunch over looking Darling Harbour and had a few beverages. The different boats in and around the Harbour are cool to look at. We headed up over the bridge which looks as though its a moveable bridge for bigger boats to come through although its looks like its in operable at the moment. Theres heaps on offer at Darling harbour, Aquarium, Australian animal zoo, boardwalk train rides for the kids, an abundance of restaurants and bars and shopping centre. There is also a IMAX theatre. Being Chinese new year there were heaps of displays in the actual harbour and on the land. Recommend you find a restaurant over looking the Harbour and sit and relax taking in the views.

This has all changed with the dismantling of the mono rail to make way for a super duper exhibition centre. Totally ruined in my opinion. Last time I was there, there was loads of construction still happening, years after it started, and it looks like a concrete jungle. It is hard to get to for someone with limited mobility, as it is a fair hike from one end over to the bus stop, which I think only goes to limited places anyway. I noticed one of the best joints there has closed, and the amount of people there was much less than on previous visits. Sux to ruin such a beautiful spot. Bring back the monorail."

It seems that every major waterfront city has an area like Darling Harbour with restaurants, tourist souvenir shops, museums and attractions. They are all crowded with tourists and all of the restaurants serve the same food with different names. Most of the souvenirs are made in another country.It is a very nice area, but we were charged a $5 per person surcharge at a restaurant because it was Sunday (or a holiday). That stinks!So my advice is to enjoy walking the Darling Habour shoppes and use the ferry terminal to travel about, but don't eat there on a Sunday or holiday. The restaurants that our group visited were not worth the price, let alone a surcharge. More on the specific restaurants in my other reviews."

It's got slides and swings and sand and water... things to climb and things to dig... all the required ingredients for very happy satisfied kids. At night it's lit up with coloured lights reminiscent of the vivid festival, and much less crowded than during the day. As long as you accept the kids will probably get at least a little bit wet, you'll all have a fab time."

Every Saturday night they have fireworks ( which we were lucky to see). They also have an IMAX in this area. Most of the bars have happy hours along with great views of course. The bridge is also nice for a stroll."

However if you are in this age bracket, don't waste your time at night as it turns into night club city. Long lines of people to get into anywhere for a drink and if you did the music is very loud.

Not really a big deal, however. The area will be extremely impressive after all the building is completed.A visit to Darling Harbour is highly recommended."

If you are on a tight budget probably not the best place to eat. Some places are a bit pricey. Every Saturday there are free fireworks, it does get busy so book a table. Oh and the Lindt Cafe is worth a trip...try a milkshake...amazing!"

Shops are varied and interesting, with several 'Australian' stores.There is a brilliant food court, with loads of choices from kebabs, grills, indian, chinese thai, etc, plus several chocolate and deserts outlets.Open the door to the outside and you are standing on the quayside, which is ringed all around by restaurants and bars. Sydney ferries stop next to the Maritime museum at Pyremont bay, right by the pyremont bridge that goes over to the other side, where all the other ferries stop, including the famous Manly ferry (see review) Paddy's market at the end of the bay should not be missed - it's huge and cheap.Chinatown, the children's water park, Chinese friendship garden, seawaoirld, wild life zoo, madame tousauds, and many more are all here on this bay. Use the manly ferry to nsee all other waterfronts and beaches in Sydney harbour."

I just offer this review in case overseas visitors who are planning their visit to Sydney keep seeing Darling Harbour mentioned but don't know why.It's an ex industrial area very close to the centre of the city that was re-developed in the 1980s. Development included a massive ugly casino, plenty of charmless hotels and apartment buildings and large freeway flyovers. Because the northern part of the CBD (downtown) has relatively few hotels, Darling Harbour can house a large number of tourists very close to the centre of the city. It has attracted the sorts of businesses that serve concentrations of tourists - bad restaurants, shiny malls selling T-shirts and Ugg boots and tourist 'attractions' like a museum of wax figures of people you can take a selfie with.Pros: If you are only able to stay a few days in Sydney, and you get a good deal on accommodation, Darling Harbour is a relatively convenient location to some of the real attractions you will want to visit. If it's a family holiday and you actually want/need to squeeze in koala patting, lizard spotting and wax 'celebrity' viewing all in a couple of hours, Darling Harbour may be an okay location to base yourself.Cons: It has acres of concrete, bare pavers and baseball cap wearing tourists licking icecreams. At the moment there are several big construction projects happening creating some noise.If you're a grown-up and have plenty of money you will prefer to stay at the north end of the downtown area. If you're a grown up and want to stay somewhere more 'real', you will prefer the area around Central Railway station/Chinatown. You can still walk to Darling Harbour from either area."

I would have loved to see the Sea Life Sydney Aquarium but it was closed when we got there.We sat on a bench on the pier to watch the show. It was amazing! I'm not sure how long it went on for but it felt like a good 30 minutes with fireworks going off from the harbour and off the tops of buildings as well. It was an impressive show to say the least.We heard a lot of great things about Darling Harbour, be sure to spend the day there."

But their Maritime Museum is something. It is free for general exhibition. But we would suggest do not go cheap and buy tickets to their major exhibitions. You can visit battleship \"Vampire\" and military submarine \"Onslow\". It is very impressive. Also you can explore their Barque. Only 4 left in the whole world. It is restored to perfect condition. You can even take a ride on it once a month. There is a Harbourside Shopping Mall, IMAX theater (largest screen in the world), Hop On Hop Off Cruises and hundreds of dining choices. "

The races were fun to watch for awhile, but one really needs to know people who are participating to fully immerse your self in the event. It started to rain, so everyone tried to huddle under the expressway overpass, which still allowed for a view of the races. The races add to the general atmosphere of Darling Harbour, which is packed with restaurants and other things to do. It is a great place to go for families, especially now that the kids area has been renovated and a new restaurant strip opened near there. One can also shop, take a cruise, ride on the carousel, or just walk around and people watch. So much to do."

Whilst figures may not be totally accurate, you will get the idea.A group of luxury apartments were recently auctioned online. Positioned on the waters edge in Darling Harbour, the first sold for 1.8 million dollars and the last made 5.9 million dollars!!!!

It is another element of the labyrinth that makes up Sydney's amazing waterfront, it is within walking distance of the City Centre, and the U shaped harbour has many attractions.We arrived by ferry from Balmain and the disembarkation point is a good place to start the thirty minute walk as it is at the far end of the harbour. You will pass attractions such as the Aquarium, the Imax cinema and the Maritme Museum, not to mention buskers of all descriptions. There are restaurants of all types along the harbour but you will pay higher prices here than in the suburbs. We ate at a Belgian place and the waitress was friendly, the food excellent, but the bill a little hefty.There is an excellent children's play area just off the waterfront with very imaginative equipment including sand and water play features. Sydney does a lot for small children and this a larger version of the excellent children's playgrounds that can be found all over the city.The Harbour does get busy, especially at weekends. On the Saturday we visited there was a Serbian Festival taking place with free music and dancing performances and stalls advertising Serbian goods - it was very atmospheric. We also enjoyed an amazing break dance performance by some athletic locals.Darling Harbour is a good place to hang out for an hour or two and watch some interesting and often out of the ordinary characters. You should include it on your Sydney itinerary."

There are tons of restaurants and bars. There are also a lot of areas for younger kids to play if you are traveling as a family. The whole area looks quite new and fresh. Still construction going on for some major buildings that will be beautiful once finished.Whoever planned the area did a great job. If you walk across the pedestrian bridge to the other side of the harbor, take the time to walk another 1 kilometer and get to the Fish Market area. That was amazing for the food and sights to see. So worth going."

I have been there once and never really need to go back. There are the typical tourist places and shops. There was very little local appeal to it. To give you an idea of how geared toward tourist this place was, it had a Starbucks. I only saw 2 Starbucks on my entire 6 weeks in Australia. It was crowded and everything was overpriced.I actually became rather upset to walk by the \"zoo\" or wax museum and see a poor koala in locked in a small viewing area desperately clinging to a tree and being hounded by tourist trying to take his picture. If that is the kind of Sydney/Australian experience you would like, then go to Darling Harbor."

Over the last 15 years I've had the chance to visit Sydney more than once but I hadn't been for quite a while, this time I visited with a husband and two kids. Darling Harbour being my favourite part of my favourite city ... now it's become a favourite place for all of us! From the Saturday evening fireworks over the summer months, to the choice of restaurants, to the newer kids free play areas, the aquarium, museums, ferries providing easy access to the rest of Sydney ... what's not to love! Can't wait until I can get to go back again ... with all the current developments it's set to be even better!! ;)"

The sunset menu at Baia is great value for money but staff aren't great. Hurricanes aren't as good as they used to be. Cyren are brilliant for both bar snacks and dinner. Cocktails are delicious and even tastier when it's happy hour. Meat and wine Co has been recommended to us various times but we were disappointed. Over price for average food.

A number of hotels are situated along and nearby the Harbour, making it a great place to stay in Sydney."

We stayed in the Darling Harbour during the summertime and Sydney Festival when there are many activities and special opportunities for visitors It features the Harbourside Shopping Centre. A great food court can be found on the ground floor, featuring many cuisines at cheap prices. Restaurants abound with many dining options. It is pretty at night time to sit and watch Sydney CBD light up. Whilst we were there, there was an evening outdoor theatre for families with some great movies to watch. There are also two ferry terminals to Circular Quay. The Pyrmont Footbridge allows people to walk to and from the CBD of Sydney."

We often take the kids in (you can park on the weekend relatively cheaply, or take advantage of $2.50 Sunday travel on the Opal card), see a show, and then take them to the water play (bring a change of clothes or swimmers) and huge kids playground - the playground is really one of the best in town, though beware it can get crowded. There is a giant chess set near the water play area too. There is a carousel and a few other rides if you are prepared to shell out the money for these too. If you bring the kids' scooter there are lovely paved areas for them to scooter around as well! The food around darling harbour is pretty ho-hum, expensive for what it is, and nothing terribly special, but there is plenty of variety if you want to grab a bite to eat."

For the many years I lived in Sydney, Darling Harbour was a rat-infested series of decaying wharves and docks.It was named after Lieutenant General Ralph Darling, who was Governor of the colony of New South Wales from 1825 to 1831. It was originally part of the commercial port of Sydney, and had sea, rail, tram and road links for the import and export of goods.During the Great Depression of 1929 it became known as \"The Hungry Mile\" because of the long queues of wharf side workers seeking work.Darling Harbour never revived and continued to degenerate. It was not until the 1980s that the NSW Government accepted a plan to redevelop the whole area as a pedestrian and tourist precinct. Darling Harbour today is full of restaurants, tourist attractions, Including the Chinese Gardens, the National Maritime Museum and the Sydney Aquarium.You can spend a whole day walking around Darling Harbour, visiting one attraction after the other, and having lunch at any number of restaurants ranging from the cheap and cheerful to fine dining with waiter service and spectacular views over the harbor;"

Get there with the lightrail using the star, pyrmont, convention, exhibition or paddy's station. You can also get there by ferry. If you want to park there are plenty of parking areas but be ready for a hefty price."

We had a few drinks in different bars, and walked about, the rain didn't dampen the darling harbour beauty! Went for dinner in Hard Rock Cafe where the staff were fantastic. Really enjoyed our walk around Darling Harbour, visiting the Chinese gardens and just taking in the beauty of it all, definitely a place not to be missed when in Sydney!!"

I remember a time when Darling Harbour only had speciality boutique shops that were rather expensive. There is plenty of eateries at Darling Harbour, including the newer eateries around the iMax theatre. However there appears to be a lot of construction in the area due to major redevelopment. So the place does seem a lot smaller than it used to be which was very spacious. Also there are plenty of restaurants in the area. There is a free play area for the kids called the Darling Quarter where kids can be occupied for hours. There are also bars and clubs on the other side of Darling Harbour. We spent New Year's Eve there for the kids fireworks at 9pm. This was a good place to take the kids as its not as busy as the Opera House or Harbour Bridge area for the fireworks display."

Without friends to push me on occasion, it would close to impossible. There is an overpass from near Druitt Street, which has a lift at the Cockle Bay end, the alternative being stairs. On return from the Hard Rock Cafe after Elton John at the Entertainment Centre, the lift was out of order and blocked off. Instead of up the lift and an easy run to my hotel, we had to, not knowing where we were going, get through blocked off construction zones to another overpass. The wheelchair involved getting up a lift, once we'd found it, past wandering drunks, up a steep rise to Sussex St., then finally a few blocks to my hotel. Again, without friends to push, it would have been impossible. As it was, it delayed us getting to our hotel and to bed. The NSW government lauds Darling Harbour as a great success. They should be ashamed of what an inaccessible, overpriced and overrrated place it is."

There was a great playground for children to play, benches to sit and enjoy the area, game boards, and recumbent bicycles. Also part of the complex was the Chinese Friendship garden. A great multi-use site - enjoying the outdoors for a walk around the water or through the park is free but there is a fee/cost for the restaurants and activities.As this was a family trip we were not looking for \"night life\" but did observe during our walk back from the ferry stop that it was a very \"happening\" place on a Friday evening! Great spot for people watching!The area is going through a face lift so there is construction, but we did not find it to detract from our experience."

The aquarium and the zoo extension are ideal for families visiting this location and the Maritime Museum still does a great job of telling a story that everyone needs to hear. The new convention and meeting facility will be a great asset. Good hotels are available on both sides of the harbour and the pedestrian bridge across makes everything easy to walk to.

I mean if you are a tourist hooray a trip to the wax museum and marvelling at some of the pimped out water taxis and that sea air is always a joy.

The little harbour also serves as a marina for pleasure craft.  The old bridge from one bank to the other is an interesting feature. The center section of the bridge actually swings around on a pivot to allow craft to pass from the end of the inlet into the open harbour The National Maritime museum sits across the road from Darling Harbour shops Across from the maritime museum and its floating exhibist, are the Sydney Aquarium, Madam Tussauds Wax Museum and the Wild Life Sydney Zoo.

I started with the wild life which show cased Australian wild life. Saw Tasmanian devil, bilby, kangeroos, koalas and lots more. My favourite were the koalas on the roof terrace . For an extra \u00a310 you could go in the koala enclosure and take photos of the koalas posing and have photos taken with the koalas by the keeper. Educational talks throughout the day..I then went to the aquarium which was very interesting they have 2 dugongs which wer not there when I last went. The big tanks are fantastic with Ray's and sharks but the small tanks with a variety of sea horses and moon jellies were also nice to see.Madame Tussaud's was great fun and very interactive. Good to have someone with you to take photos of the stars. Well laid out and very enjoyable fun."

Melbourne Cup Day and the place was 'jumping' and packed. Heaps of temporary Betting spots with very, very long queues. Everyone well dressed and ladies in beautiful frocks and hats. Tables all decorated and covered in Champagne bottles. Didn't know Sydneyites so passionate about our Melbourne Cup Horse Race."

It is a Must to visit.Just sitting on the Harbour side and watching the scenery is amazing. Unfortunately at present there is a big building site which spoils the scenery a bit on one site, but its still a great place. Every Saturday night they have a Firework, which we unfortunately missed. But we got told it is amazing."

Sitting in a waterside Restaurant and having a leisurely late lunch/early dinner, watching the passing parade with sooooo many restaurants to choose from. Then you can walk around and see what is happening, if you are a local make sure you go at least once when the Festival of Sydney is on in January as there will be lot's happening at Darling Harbour and an outside theatre. The water feature is wonderful for the children in any weather, you know what they are like when it comes to messing in water. We would wander down there at least 6 times a year, for tourists it takes on a totally different experience, just go an enjoy."

There are a number of sightseeing venues located within walking distance from each other, now on both sides of the harbor. You could easily spend a day here, especially if you have kids with you. They also have quite a few of the harbor cruises that leave from the public docks here.We went over for supper at one of the restaurants that had outside seating and that worked out very well. To get back over to Circular Quay and our hotel, we caught a ferry after dinner and had a great ride back that stopped in several places around the main harbor. It was a well run operation, ran on time, and was pretty reasonably priced. Easy to tell which one you wanted and you could choose from a direct run or the scenic route."

Felt disappointed with the shops as many are repetitious, selling the same 'Australiana' and Ugg Boots, mostly catering to the overseas tourists. It is still interesting to see their wares & you'll get a laugh.Love this area of Sydney as you have lots of attractions to see in this big area including the Maritime Museum, Aquarium/Wax Museum/Zoo, Tall Ship & Naval Vessel, buskers & entertainers, Imax Theatre, kids playground, skirmish, 10 pin bowling, galleries and you can book your cruises here (Captain Cook) or catch the ferry or water taxi.Easy access and can spend as little or as much time here as you want.

It offers a lot of eating and drinking venues, as well as acting as a good hub for transport in terms of the numerous ferry stops it hosts.We also had the delight of experiencing the entertainment Darling Harbour has to offer in the form of the Fiesta festival. This was amazing, the atmosphere was brilliant, the fireworks were great, and best of all it was all free! Would definitely visit again in the future!"

This place is a lot of fun, relax, eat, entertain and a family day out kind of an area in Sydney.In the heart of the CBD and yet so beautiful and clean. The entire promenade (stretch of walk) which starts from the Cyren restaurant and perhaps ends now all the way at the best Asian Restaurant called MALAYA at the King Street Wharf, is a visual and a gastronomical pleasure.The eateries are amazing !! The Garlic Prawns in a Hot Pot at the 'Nick's\" Seafood restaurant, are the best that I have ever had on this earth. Dip into the sauce with some sourdough bread. This eatery is highly recommended. The Malaya at the other end (at King Street Wharf) is the best place to eat if you love Asian cuisine. It is a living legend on Sydney waterfront.The activities for kids are ample and this place is also famous for its whale watching ferries that take you across for the experience....but heftily priced.It is so close to the business areas which have the big office of Commonwealth Bank, PwC Australia, and many great global firms and companies that line the waterfront.This area also has a beautiful walking bridge connecting you to the wonderful Pyrmont area which has hordes of attraction and restaurants. The very highly recommended tourist attaraction is the Darling Harbour and Cockle Bay Wharf areas and promenade."

We stayed close by to Darling Harbour, and whilst much of the Harbour area was under massive reconstruction work, we found the area immediately around Darling Harbour very `alive` .. we were visiting on the weekend of the NRL Grand Final and this only added to the excitement, with attractions having been built at the Harbour for the NRL fans. That by the by, Darling Harbour was a wonderful place to visit (even in the midst of all of the building work !), the choice of restaurants was just excellent and we enjoyed a few wonderful and reasonably priced meals, we tended to eat early evening and were always able to get tables near the walkways so that we could savour the mood, the passers-by and the wonderful mix of cultures around the Harbour. Additionally, we found a very good shopping mall down at the Harbour with some great shops and what looked to be a food mall offering a wide choice of international cuisine. We saw little or no bad behaviour down at the Harbour even though alcohol was being consumed in fairly large quantities by some visitors, and over our short holiday we returned to the Harbour a number of times, most early evening, for food and drinks. We really love Darling Harbour, a great place to visit when you are in Sydney .. if you want, there are many specific attractions down at the Harbour although we did not visit any, preferring to just take in the atmosphere generally."

Tall ships and Steamers added interest. Bridge across to CBD great idea.

It was always an 'artificially constructed harbour' and so doesnt have the 'true ring' of a harbour..rather a 'converted dockyard' (which is what it is)Now that the main mode of transport..the Monorail, has been demolished, it is not an 'easy walk' as the adverts claim to get there and more difficult to get back to the centre of Sydney...quite a steep walk up the hill actually. Main attractions however, are the magnificent aquarium, and the Chinese Gardens. Apart from these two excellent features, the rest is just a lot of eateries and the IMAX cinema if one is interested. Probably good on a rainy day..well the aquarium and the cinema that is.! Better spend your time at the Museum of Natural History in College Street, Sydney."

See the ships from bygone era share the harbour with modern sea warfare. Walk over the bridge to the other side to enjoy the wildlife zoo, aquarium, wax museum and other various attractions. Ideal for kids and equally appealing to grown-ups, Darling Harbour has host of attractions to keep everyone happy. Grab a bite at harbour facing cafes and restaurants that serve up delish dishes from various cuisines. Be prepared to walk a lot but its fun. The place looks enchanting at night and the tempo doesn't set till midnight. Do plan to see the fireworks that take place after 8:30pm on Saturdays. Highly recommended when in Sydney. The Westfield Sydney Tower Eye, Queen Victoria Building and neighbouring shopping centres are just a 15-20 minute walk away.

Things were a little pricy as far as I could see but not unexpectedly so.Anyhow, we had hoped to do a harbour hop-on hop-off boat trip but it was early afternoon and they cease to be cost-effective at that point as you don't have enough time to maximise the ticket. So we just took a Majestic 2 hour cruise which was great - took us to most of the sights in the harbour and we enjoyed a glass of wine as part of the ticket.

You can also get a ferry across the harbour which gives you a different perspective :) Overall a very nice place for a stroll with friends :)"

Darling Harbour is Sydney's relaxed entertainment venue.Families with small children can find a fantastic children's playground underneath the highway overpass (this is nicer than it sounds!) with cafes and a McDonalds nearby for takeaways while supervising their fun.Harbourside shopping centre has a great food court and bargain/good value clothes shopping. By night the bars and restaurants in Cockle Bay Wharf and Harbourside come to life, maybe not with a roar, but there are plenty of options available.If you're on a budget I would recommend going upstairs (above the chocolate cafe) to Blackbird cafe where the prices are a little more relaxed and the views are better than the ground floor cafes.In general, while there are a few party venues, Darling Harbour is not the place to go if you're looking for a wild night out with great music, dancing or meeting lots of cool people - try the Rocks or Newtown if this is your thing. The atmosphere is ideally suited to families and couples. You can hear each other talk, people watch and sit by the harbour, there's lots of romantic spots to hide away in and enjoy each others company."

Our expectations were high, but poor hospitality greeted us at almost every location. We have visited many places in Australia and loved it. Save your time and money and visit any where else, but not Sydney. Very disappointing from start to finish. The most courteous person was the guy cleaning the tables at McDonalds, Circular Quay - he should be promoted in charge of hospitality for Sydney."

The changes made to Darling harbour over the last 15 years are amazing. Its a more family friendly environment now and even after dark - feels like a safe place to be walking around with family /friends. There is always something going on and lucky for us we got to see the fireworks which were pretty awesome and topped off a great day out. There are so many places to eat, something for everyone. I do think more toilet facilities would be awesome though and maybe more of those little trains that take you from one side of the harbour to the other? Its a shame the monorail has been removed as that was an important part of Darling Harbour. We'll be back of course."

It can get very busy on the weekends and at night. Book restaurants if you want to go to a fine dining place to ensure your table. Take water, hat, sunscreen. It does get hot. Parking is tricky. You will need to find a parking station. Walk from city is steep but relatively easy and direct. Ferries from Circular Quay also drop off to Darling Harbour area too.

Many areas are fenced off and there are working areas all over the place. Walking from hay Street (Paddy's Markets) to Darling Harbour, you can easily get lost. I ended up going up a ramp to The Powerhouse! Decided to u turn and go back and walked around the walkway in between construction fences and came across the Chinese Gardens Of Friendship, which are huge, and there's a fee to get in, and finally around to the main part of Darling Harbour, where there seems to be just a lot of lounges for people to relax and sit in, a high chess board, lots of restaurants, and not a lot of much else.I ended up walking from Darling Harbour up Sussex Street towards the city, past Sydney Souvenir Warehouse, and ending up at George Street opposite World Square Shopping Centre. Darling Harbour is the home of the IMAX Theatre, National Maritime Museum, Carousel, Sydney Aquarium, Wild Life Sydney and has a fireworks display, weather allowing, every Saturday night."

It was lovely to walk about stopping off at restaurants and bars, especially when dark with all the lights reflecting off the water, a little haven amongst the high rise buildings.To my horror this year the space is being in-filled. The marina at Cockle Bay Wharf is filling, There was some kind of ugly big floating pavilion in one corner of the Southern end which ruins the uninterrupted view that there was for a pedestrian is being lost. I hope this is temporary, there is some construction work going on in the open spaces nearby so maybe the pavilion will be re-housed in there.Darling Harbour is close to the CBD and well worth a visit. It can also be reached by ferry. There is a wonderful selection of restaurants with a wide variety of cuisines. There is a good shopping centre inside the lines of restaurants on the West side.Appeal to whoever is in charge: Just please keep the open space feel that worked so well. My rating has been marked down because of this."

I hadn't been to Darling Harbour since the monorail (actually this was the most wheelchair friendly transport in town) was taken down... and all the exhibition centre was demolished to make way for more inner city apartments... Darling Harbour now is a nightmare for someone in a wheelchair... just simple things like getting across the road and into the shopping centre has become more challenging. We decided to get a ferry back to Circular Quay... walked/rolled all the way down past the Maratime Museum to find the Ferry wharf at Pyrmont Bay had been demolished as well.. so we then had to go all the way around to the other side of the harbour to get a ferry. Anyone in a wheelchair contemplating Darling Harbour in its present state.. DON'T! Unless you really have to go there."

What can I tell you about Darling Harbour, it is a lovely location, usually in summer and spring the weather is stunning and it is well worth a visit if you are in Sydney. It is quite cosmopolitan with fantastic cafes lining the walkway, it can be a little on the expensive side but you are in a major city so I guess that is to be expected, I enjoyed a walking through Darling Harbour during my lunch break, however, I rarely bought lunch there, way above my general budget and close by there are so many fantastic cheap eating places. However, if you want to indulge or it\u00b4s one of those days where you feel like treating yourself, the amount of restaurants and cafes will give you choice fatigue.... I have never had a bad meal there. I lived in Sydney for years and it\u00b4s a favorite with us locals as well as the tourists, it never seems to lose it\u00b4s appeal and there is always something interesting happening down there. . it\u00b4s a great place to get away from the bustle of the city and enjoy the scenery, although in the tourist season, it can be very busy."

It has a relaxed vibe and there's no pressure from anyone to visit their attraction.Take some time to wander and choose what you'd most like to do. You are spoilt for choice. There is also the opportunity to walk round the harbour if you want to get away from the crowds. We visited during Vivid Sydney and it had plenty to see and was very impressive. Well worth spending some time in."

Restaurants are even more overpriced than elsewhere in Australia. The restaurant I visited charged AU$4.50 (US$3.52) for a small glass of Pepsi and the server did not even bring the bottle. There was an AU$10 surcharge because I visited on a Sunday. What is up with that? If restaurants have to pay employees extra for working on Sunday by government decree, they should bear the extra cost, not the lowly consumer. All in all, a very unsatisfactory experience."

On our recent trip we just walked around in the sunshine, sipped coffee in a beautiful little coffee shop overlooking the harbour, and generally enjoyed the scenery and atmosphere. We wandered towards the adjoining park and playground area, which has the most fantastic water and sand play area as well as other climbing and playground equipment. It was buzzing with many family groups enjoying the sunshine, and having a wonderful time. We really wished that we had our grandchildren with us to have an excuse to play too! Later in the day when the cold wind came up, we escaped to the shops and browsed through the shopping centre before enjoying another coffee and churros - yum!"

If you don't have any shopping to do, stroll up Union St away from the hustle and bustle for something less pricy to eat or drink. Sydney Aquarium and Sydney National Maritime are interesting museums located waterfront in the harbour.

If you are getting here by car try parking at the Star City Casino, it's relatively cheap and if you PLAY a little, you can ask at the desk for your parking ticket to be validated free of charge. It's just a 5 min walk to Darling Harbour from here. In Darling Harbour you can enjoy a wonderful lunch at one of the many licensed restaurants. Try walking down to the southern end to visit the Chinese Garden of friendship, if you like nature this will blow your mind..so much to see inside for a very small fee, you can even get dressed up in authentic Chinese clothing for a photo shoot. Nearby is Chinatown for wonderfull food. There is a 3D Cinema near the many restaurants within Darling Harbour and you can even hop on a mini train to get around easier and rest those tired feet. If you want to go to see the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House just hop on a ferry and it's a short but sensational ride into Circular Quay. Enjoy!!"

Look, Darling harbour / Cockle bay ain't the best this beautiful country of ours has to offer - it's your classic tourist trap where the waterfront is littered with pizza, faux bistro, cocktail (served in plasticware - classy), sushi and choco cafes joints (oh, there's even a Hard Rock Cafe to set the tone) - but it's a safe environment with enough distractions if you have a very young family. If I were you however, I'd elect to traipse through the Rocks head for the base of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and walk the length of it (takes about fifteen minutes) because the view from the Northern base of the Bridge is the best - with the Opera House framed under the Harbour Bridge. Better, in my opinion than, Lady Macquarie's chair."

There are so many great places to eat from cheap eats to seriously elegant restaurants. There are plenty of bars too, all offering happy hour and a scrumptious endless list of cocktails. It can be a bit pricey to sit and drink for a few hours but hey we don't tend to do it that often so when we do we splurge. We have a favourite bar Znicks, it is right in the waterfront on the marina side. There is a table all on it's own, away from everyone else and as luck would have it every time we have been there we have got the table. I just love it. It is right near the bird fountain which changes colour in the evening and on a Saturday evening at 9pm you get fireworks which are lovely. It's just fun to wander about, watch the buskers and the dance crews. The shopping is a bit pricey but I have also got some really lovely bargains too. The food court in the opposite side to the Marina is fantastic and has so many dining options, all of which look so good. So when you are next in Sydney you can easily spend a few hours eating, drinking and strolling about. You'll be glad you did."

However the reality was very different in that all the character had been sucked out of the various Quays and replaced with generic modern buildings and chain restaurants so that you could almost be anywhere else in the world. Bangaroo seems to have taken over a large chunk of the Harbour and they are building more high rise offices so that in a few years time it will be like another Canary Wharf - soul less. They are even pulling down old buildings with character on Millers Point to replace with more office space."

Also boasts the Sydney Imax theatre of you were so inclined. 3-4 star hotels abound in this area for those inclined.A refresh is needed though as it is looking very tired. the pedestrian bridge needs repaving and some of the accoutrements adorning it to be fixed up &/or replaced. The old (now disassembled & removed) monorail stations still stand there, disused and boarded up - they should either be repurposed or dismantled."

Lovely area with lots of restaurants, family had lunch, prices were very reasonable for good quality food. There is a naval museum to visit, we sadly did not have time. You can catch a ferry which will take you around to Sydney cove passing under the harbour bridge. Further on a great photo opportunity as you pass the Opera house. Finally you arrive at the ferry terminal at Circular Cove."

Make sure, if is a hot day, to bring some spare clothes for them as they can play with water and get very wet.Lind Cafe is a must go place if you like chocolates. Restaurants are a bit expensive, but, worth it to seat down and relax.Make sure you check if fire works are on on the night and book an ocean view table to make the most of it.If you want to have a huge feed, try Braza Barbecue, all you can eat meet, excellent, If you prefer a burger, Hard Rock Cafe is a cool place to go."

Most attractions indicated above charge entrance fees, except for the Tumbalong Park, City Markets, and Chinatown. Restaurants and bars are also present at this attraction.Ferries to other places outside of Sydney can be boarded at the Darling Harbour.

Darling Harbour has something for everyone from bars and restaurants to eat in to a warship and submarine to explore!There is so much to see and do both day and night, the bridge across the harbour gives great views of everything and gives access to the Star Casino.many boat trips leave from Kings Street Wharf to suit all requirements from whale watching to dance and also dinner cruises.There is at the moment quite a lot of building that detracts somewhat and will do for the next year at least but the harbour is still a must visit!"

I really felt for the poor animals in the wild park below having to tolerate this every evening, and probably even the fish in the aquarium needed earplugs in.Probably better for families as most of the family friendly activities centre around here. It was difficult to find a restaurant that wasn't chock full, but it was Chinese new year so maybe it is not usually so busy. The fireworks in the evening were great (again worried for the animals in the zoo), as were the decorations in the Chinese garden."

The maritime museum was worth a look especially the chance to go in a real submarine, a warship and a replica of Capt Cooks ship too- very interesting.

Scenic and pleasant to walk around sadly most bars are overpriced, be careful of surcharges on weekends and why keep happy hour boards out when happy hour just doesn't happen. Often food was a little above canteen standard, there are better places to eat for the same money. Not enough room for tiny trains and pedestrians."

They've built a couple of flyovers in the interim and it makes the whole place feel dark and enclosed. Where before I enjoyed some pretty water features and Chinese garden, now I walked in a darkened cramped space now given over to a children's playground. There are more expensive eating places but nothing much to see. Not worth the visit unless you're going to the aquarium (not open in the evenings)"

We visited exactly 12 months ago also and it looks relatively the same, still nice bars and scenery, shopping centre and maritime museum around the other side, one addition (well didbn't notice them last year) several small trains and carriages that carry people around the pathways, the go from about Madame Tussauds to the shopping centre and have a few stops along the way inckuding the Chinese Friendship Garden, the cost is $5 hop - hop off so if you do one stop and hop off then hop back on then it's another $5, never used them but handy on a hot day if your doing the full walk to museum or shopping centre.One annoying thing about Darling Harbour is the lack of shade and undercover, it rained a bit this year and nowhere undercover or very minimal and same when sun is beating down so remember hats or umbrella's, the call WA the nanny state but who cares they do shade sales and cover from the elements very well.Darling Harbour is a great place to visit several times and a nice ferry ride from Circular Quay"

I will totally agree to all the reviews, this place is lovely and centrally located to most of the attractions in Sydney namely sealife, wild life and madame tussauds,chinatown,sydney fish market,QVB and ferry terminal.Was so convenient to walk to all this places. Every Saturday night there is a display of fireworks in the harbour and is worth watching.Ferries can be taken from wharf No 3 and also from opposite the sealife.It is a must that you view the opera house and harbour bridge not only by land but also from the sea.The view is scenic and magnificient but catch it between sunset and night so you get to see both views.You can take the boat from darling harbour and return back with the same ferry.What is more the ferry comes with free wifi.Buy the tickets to the attraction on line and combo packages which is much cheaper."

No elevators and the escalators were broken the first two weeks in January. It was miserable trying to get my elderly parents down the steps to get to the zoo, wax museum, and aquarium. Once on the level of the shops, museums, and restaurants, you could spend all day at Darling Harbor. It is serviced really only by the water ferries. As stated earlier, if you come by train, you have to walk a short distance downhill, but it takes you to up high and the only way to get to the museums, shops, and restaurants is to take stairs down. On the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 side, there is a small trolley that takes you to the central train terminal, but the trolley comes every 30 minutes, crowded, and to get to that side is 20 minute walk up steps. It was not handicap friendly unless you arrive via water ferry and that is walk to the shops and restaurants."

As there are plenty of better places to go in Sydney that have far better views. The entertainment centre and the casino are within the precinct though, so if you're into that sort of thing do go here. Otherwise, enjoy your walk through this concrete metropolis with a bit of harbour."

The merit of Darling harbour is the variety sites packed in easy walking distance - the maritime museum, wildlife world, aquarium, wax museum, chinese gardens.

The light rail works well on the Western side of Darling Harbour, but only provides transport on the North-South axis, but if you are going to or from the CBD be prepared for a hike."

The Helm is a really vibrant bar / restaurant which has specialist nights all week, we ate on a Tuesday and paid $10 for a steak meal which was cooked to our exact request. Steer clear of Nicks bar if you want just a drink from the bar some of the staff are not very helpful. For breakfasts and other food try the Plate great poached eggs (ask for Katrina) she will make you feel at home. For something different try one of the Captain Cooks dining evenings, great food at a reasonable price, also check for vouchers which you can also get upto 15% off. The hop on off ferries are good value but although it is a 24 hour pass you will need to be on an early one to get best value. Overall 9/10 will definitely return."

Restaurants were extremely busy though, so for couples wanting a quiet night out you can pretty much forget that down a the waterfront level.

It's Sydney harbour's ugly backwater, where the surrounding architecture is definitively 80's and jumbled with more recent contrived structures. The scene is geared to middle of the road, and somewhat overpriced dining and gaudy entertainment. It is a tourist attraction, with an aquarium, a wild life enclosure, where people line up to see imprisoned wallabies and koalas, along with captive birds and what not. Across the way the Maritime museum offers some substance to what is really a mishmash of restaurants and bars and most anticipated of all, not, is the wax museum, where if on a hot day, you would hope the air conditioning doesn't breakdown while you're posing next to an effigy of Nicole Kidman or Hugh Jackman...it may result in a sad looking selfie. At night, the under dressed crowds of young women and testosterone pumped yobbos, participate in the fine Australian tradition of Blotto, drinking as though one has just won lotto and jumping or falling or being pushed into the dark harbour... Every year people drown in this vacuous harbour."

It felt almost surreal, like out of some movie or something. It is the place to meet people in Sydney, this is where everyone in Sydney goes to enjoy a good meal, a cold beer, do a little shopping, or just relax and enjoy the lawns and scenic harbor with all the masted boats. The famous Sydney Sea Aquarium is here. What is so appealing is not only the layout, but the beautiful and seamless way in which it is all presented. One can see that it was well-planned from the moment they walk into the area. Do not miss the Saturday night fireworks, it is a full blown display that will leave you breathless, and it happens every Saturday night."

The entire Darling Harbour was buzzing with life. Many, many people out enjoying themselves. A great area to enjoy the fireworks and a great place to end our vacation.

Also, students can make use of discount coupons if you manage to get your hands on them.Almost everything one needs for a fun night can be found here, from bowling to laser tag, to street shows and pool tables in pubs. Saturday nights are lovely with the fireworks. And weekend parking is also available at a reasonable price. Cant forget the 2010 football world cup being screened on large screens floating on the water. Still feels like home every time I go back there."

It is hard to imagine that there would not be things to interest many visitors here. From Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 style places to Top Class Restaurants in Cockle Bay as well as King Street Wharf.

Cafes and restaurants, pubs and nightclubs abound all around Darling Harbour.There is a main shopping centre on the west side. In the main shopping mall there is a food court for quick, cheap and cheerful, many shops, eateries. Attractions around DH are the Aquarium, iMax theatre, Madame Taussauds Wax museum, native animal zoo and Chinese Gardens, Maritime Museum with great interactive activities for all ages. . Tickets can be purchased there but a multi pack can be bought on line or at the Info centre and this is cheaper. There is a children' water park found outside the info centre. Reported to be the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. This is for younger children so don't expect huge water slides. At the southern end past Tumbalong Park and the Entertainment centre can be found Paddy's Markets ( a large Chinese Food and general goods market) open Thurs thru Sunday. To get there:- bus or train to Wynyard, Town Hall or bus to the Queen Victoria Building and walk down the hill ( 500 metres) to Darling Harbour. Or train or bus to Central railway station and walk . But this is a lot further. Activities in Tumbalong Park are held most weekends . Look up the ?Darling Harbour website."

Its only a 10 minute walk from most of the Sydney CBD and hotels or very short taxi fare down there but I prefer to walk. Great restaurants, both sit down and take away as well as shops like Lindt chocolates which is great for desert or a hot chocololate/coffee. The Imax 3D theatre is here, Chinese Gardens, shopping mainly for out of town tourists and along the walkway at Cockle Bay Wharf are the bars with food and better restaurants. On the way to Cockle Bay Wharf you pass the Wildlife Sydney Zoo (not to be confused with Taronga Park Zoo on the other side of the harbour at Mosman), Sydney Aquarium and Madame Tussauds. Most of the Harbour cruises leave from here, and there are Water Taxis and Jet Boats that also leave from Darling Harbour. A great spot to spend all or part of your day. I suggest having breakfast on your way there, a harbour cruise for lunch and then spend your evening in Darling Harbour."

City planners have given the masses somewhere to go and that's to be applauded. Overpriced large scale restaurants and bars abound - just don't expect intimate or highly rated gourmet. Saturday night fireworks are an attraction so if you're celebrating with friends they will be an added bonus. Highlights of the area are the Chinese Gardens (open in daylight hours to the public) and Imax. Perhaps the main reason why this place exists will become apparent once the Conference and Exhibition Centres are rebuilt. The plans look good so we're lookin' to the future!"

There are some upsides though such as the excellent Maritime Museum, IMAX cinema and Darling Quarter kids playground so it's worth spending some time there if you have those in mind. If your idea of hell though is to sit outside shooing away scavenging birds from your food, getting poked in the eye with a 'selfie stick' whilst dealing with a merchant who only expects to see you once then this place is best avoided."

Amazing coffees and wines! And if you like the evening lights, its a great romantic place! Has some great places for dancing. And Saturday's fireworks are breath taking. A friend popped the question to his girl in the backdrop of those gorgeous lights! It's a nice place for solitude lovers too. Allows plenty of space by the water itself otherwise with the choice of cuisines and restaurants.  You don't need a reason to go to Darling Harbour! I take every newbie friend to this place lol!

Our girls enjoyed some of the shoe stores and cotton clothing shops, but no different here to anywhere else. We took the kids to IMAX, which is always a popular option for them (they are teenagers), and at the other end is the aquarium. We find ferries a bit of a hassle to catch from here, and would prefer to walk into the city and catch the free 555 bus to Circular Quay from all along George St, and catch ferries from there.If you walk the other way, you get o the Chinese Gardens, which we love, and walk a bit further and you are right in China Town, which is another whole experience!Well worth a visit!"

It is easy walking (or pushing a pram or wheelchair) and there is always so much to see and do. There is nothing better on a nice day than walking around and getting a bit of sunshine and exercise near the waterfront. There is an abundance of cafes and restaurants and surprisingly you can get meals at very reasonable prices. I love watching the free entertainment and just soaking up the atmosphere. Of course Darling Harbour is also the home of many of the city's major attractions such as Paddy's Markets, Sydney Aquarium, Sydney Wildlife World, Madame Trussards, Powerhouse Museum, Australian Maritime Museum and the Chinese Garden of Friendship to name a few. You could spend a week just exploring everything Darling Harbour has to offer."

But there are some hidden gems including the regular free festivals and free fireworks display.If you are a tourist, I recommend checking out the aquarium, wildlife park and Madame Tussauds. You can purchase a combined ticket which makes it affordable to see 2 or 3 of them for not much more than the cost of 1 ticket.If you have children, I recommend seeing the fireworks which happen ost weekends at around 8:30pm / 9pm. The children's playground and water feature behind the iMax cinema is another popular place for kids. The iMax cinema, bowling, karaoke and laser skirmish are also popular and regularly discountedIf you're a little older and are interested in bars, I recommend sticking to the King st Wharf side and seeing Bungalow 8 or Cargo Bar. The bars on the Darling Harbour side are over priced and a little more rough. Bungalow 8 and Cargo Bar are also good for lunch / early drinks and have an extensive cocktail and food menus."

Darling Harbour was established as a space in Sydney for the people at the time of the bicentenary of Australia's settlement as a colony of England (1988). It's been an attraction for tourists and locals alike with many attractions and restaurants within walking distance of the general area. However, it is in maintenance and improvement mode and is somewhat disappointing for the complete experience. Look out for signs and building happening and be aware there is less 'fun' to be had. Nevertheless there are peaceful spots and grass as well as water fun on hot days. Free."

It offers a vast array of shops , restaurants and harbour views; however, the down side is that everything is frightfully expensive.Most restaurants are at best a bit above average. Be prepared to pay twice what you would pay in other parts of Sydney if you dine at Darling Harbour. If you are visiting Sydney, and want to dine at a good restaurant, go to Newtown, Leichhardt, the lower North Shore or the Eastern Suburbs - the food is better and better priced."

For maritime enthusiast don't miss the Maritime Museum. For dinner, try 1 meter pizza in Crinitis, but on Sat night its no way withiout prior booking. Instead try Pancake of The Rocks Of course after waiting for some minutes. If you want a value dinner, just go to the food court for Indian, Oporto, sandwich, KFC or McD (??) Or Gloria Jeans for Coffee.Don't miss the firework on Sat night at 9 pm at Spring / summer. Different schedule on winter and fall. After firework, the street dancer performance around Crinitis is worth to see.Finish your night by dessert in Lindt chocolate or chill out for beer in the bar around. You'll find Starbuck and Hard Rock Cafe nearby."

The restaurants are extremely expensive with nothing getting you under 60 aus for two. For me that is ridiculous. I would rather spend that money on things that will last longer than food."

It's not only a safe area, but exceptionally clean as well. China Town & Pattys market were great, but the walks up & down the warf on both sides were spectacular. Many, many restaurants/ bars & shopping stores. We did the Whale watch as well & highly suggest that attraction. For all tours/ attractions etc., check out groupon/ Syney for some great savings( some up to 75% off). Some dining is quite costly, but look for places like Subway or McDonalds for family savings & get the food to go & find one of many park benches & enjoy your food with a view!

(Good value, relaxing trip, great views of Opera House & Harbor Bridge.) We were dropped off at King Street Wharf. The area had an abundant number of outdoor cafes and restaurants along the ~ 10 minute walk to Cockle Bay wharf. Cockle Bay had even more restaurant and bar options with indoor/outdoor seating. The aquarium, Madame Tussaud's, and IMAX theaters are located on this side but were closed during our evening visit. We only encountered one open shop (adjacent to the aquarium) that had a nice variety of souvenirs. Most eateries were packed and the place was crawling with with bachelor and bachelorette parties. At 8:30pm on Saturday nights (which our visit happened to fall on), the Harbor produces an ~ 15 min long firework show which was quite enjoyable. We didn't make it around to the other side of the Harbor (Harbourside Shopping Center) so we can't speak to the quality of shopping there. We also regret not making it during daylight hours to visit the Chinese Gardens as we've heard good things. We randomly chose a restaurant for dinner and really regret that choice. I will write a separate review for them - Baia the Italian. (Horrible!!!!! Stay away!) Overall, we enjoyed our stroll through Darling Harbor and wished we had more time/energy to more thoroughly explore the offerings. At night, it's a very vibrant area with mostly twenty-somethings that are dressed in a variety of smart casual and LBD (little black dress) attire."

I had the pleasure of living by Darling Harbour in 2000 for 3 months and I can honestly say that I love this place!!I rented an apartment in the Grand Mercure (not sure if its still called that) and the hotel back entrance was straight out onto the bridge. In my opinion that place just has the \"vibe\"! There was an abundance of restaurants and bars, access to the monorail and strolling distance to the city centre.The hotel/apartment block had a roof top pool that overlooked the water. I spent many a days chilling out and watching the world go by,If you are heading to Sydney, head to Darling Harbour and feel the \"vibe\". Fantastic place!"

A walk across the historic bridge that traverses the harbor takes you right into downtown. You should be able to walk to Darling Harbour from many of the popular hotels in Sydney's CBD (Central Business District)."

Hopefully it will be good, at the moment it is a bit of a shame to see the large construction site instead of the buildings that were there which always had good events going on. Nice idea to have peep holes in the construction walling so you could see in and watch some progress rather than being a total eye sore. Look forward to seeing it finished."

The Gadigal people are the original inhabitants of Sydney Cove however now Darling Harbour is on the hit list for tourists and day trippers - it's lost touch with how other inlet coves and waterways look in terms of natural beauty.Commercialism, residential high rises, water craft and other concepts to attract visitors have taken control of this beautiful inlet. However It's great visiting (at least once) the Maritime Museum, Aquarium the Friendship Garden, shopping for high end souvenirs or eating at the obligatory eateries.Explore something interesting on their website about the timeline and history of this place and get a better idea how this small inlet was transformed. If overnighting there are several hotel and apartment complexes to admire the pretty lights at night (the Sydney Casino is relatively close too). On the ferry stop across from DH there is a very unique monument called the 'Welcome Wall' outlining our immigrant history - families have a chance to include their names and where they came from - brilliant!We came by ferry but you can also reach it by train/bus (with a short downhill walk) or even by water taxi - the Light Rail from Central Station also has a few stops on the way to Darling Harbour to include Paddy's Market and the Powerhouse Museum - look up their schedule.Enjoy your experience!"

Also a bit further around there are great attractions like sea world,wax museum,australian wildlife etc..... Which i may add are well worth a look in there selves. Across from them (short walk) is a really big Maritime museum which sadly we never had time to see but it will be one of the first things i look at when i return SOON i hope???

If you buy a \"big ticket\" for Aus$39 each it allows you access to the Maritime Museum and all the ships, the lighthouse and attractions in dock there. Some restaurants are a bit exclusive and pricy but most are reasonable and there is plenty to see and do inside and out. Parking in the area is very expensive so take public transport if possible. It's further than you realise from the bridge and opera house so don't try and walk it like we did! Bad idea ! And watch out for the seagulls if you're eating outside - they're very accurate with their beaks and you'll lose your food if you're not careful! There is some development taking place at the moment so some areas are closed off but the parkland will be much larger when it's finished and there will be more parking.

A massive free fireworks show erupted and lit up the night. Must have gone on for 40mins with booms of cheers and applause at the end. Apparently it happens every Saturday night!

We caught a few harbour cruises from here too which was so convenient especially with a 2 yr old. The shops here aren't too bad but I wouldn't just come here to go shopping. Everyone seemed friendly and helpful. It doesn't take long to walk to Sydney CBD from here.

The harbor is bustling and crowded on weekends and evenings. Yet, it has some of best eating joints in Sydney. The connectivity to various beaches and the Circular Quay is great. If you're a shopaholic from Asia, Sydney is probably not the best of shopping hubs-choose asian getaways for shopping.A must visit are the Opera House, Blue Mountains, Bondi Beach and Manly Island and Beach.While Bondi is connected through bus services, Manly being an island, can be reached via ferry services only. Bondi is crowded, but a beautiful beach with chilly waters. For secluded and quiter beaches, you could check the local maps and then choose the bus routes accordingly. There are a number of options Sydney has to offer for beaches.The Opera House is a must see for all. You could reach the Opera House by taking a train for Circular Quay. The Sydney Harbour Bridge is right there too. If you're an enthusiast and travelling sans babies, you could try climbing the bridge too.For those travelling with kids, the sea world at Darling Harbor is a must visit. Sydney has some beautiful parks too, like the Hyde Park, again a walk away from Darling Harbor. Dinner is early at most restaurants in Sydney- 7 pm is the ideal time. Most restaurants close down early and the streets are desrted by 9-9:30 pm. Best to be back to your room by that time, to avoid miscreants."

The Darling Harbour is officially one of my favorite places in Sydney and we were lucky to be staying just a few meters away from it during our recent trip to the city. Darling Harbour is lined with restaurants, pubs, caf\u00e9s and I guarantee you will never run out of gastronomic options in this area - some of them are very reasonably-priced even. You can take a relaxing stroll along the harbour in the morning and just admire the beauty of the ferries and water taxis docked here. And just when you think it can't get any prettier than how it is in daylight, Darling Harbour will take your breath away at night, when all the lights are reflected on the water and the whole stretch is just vibrating with cool music coming from the shops and restaurants. At Cockle Bay Wharf, you will find the famous Lindt Caf\u00e9 and after just a few metres, you will find Madame Tussaud's, the Aquarium/SeaLife and WildLife - and IMAX, too. If you love taking photos, you will surely find great subjects to photograph at (the) Darling Harbour."

The Darling Harbour area is on the far side of Cockle Bay, but is the general area for a lot to do.Sea Aquarium, Wildlife Exhibit, Madam Tussad's, IMAX, Maritime Museum, one of the two Ferry areas of Sydney, shopping malls, hotels, restaurants, water taxi's, etc. There is so much contained in this area that you could easily spend 1-2 days here. I will write separate reviews for the activities that we visited.Most things shut down early for American Standards. Most activities are up and running by 9AM, but shut down from 5-7PM. We spent one full day in this area, and wish we had more time. Parking is easy to find on this side of the Bay, and there are several of the large hotels. Reserve your parking in advance, and you will get a much better rate than a per hour rate. This also gives you a nice gps address to target, as downtown Sydney has no shortage of traffic, and exits.Awesome area!!!! A short walk across Pyrmount Bridge (scenic by it's own), and your on the edge of the downtown, and a short walk to the Tower Eye."

Water taxis that can take you to the Opera House or Luna Park etc. run from the harbour. The water taxis are cheap and a fun way to see the bridge, opera house ....

If you do nothing else on your trip to Sydney, take a trip on one of Sydney's old double-decker ferries (partly for heritage value, partly so you can sit outside). Whether you are a tourist or on business, give yourself an hour or so's break and go down to Circular Quay, find which ferry is going next, buy a ticket and go. And sit outside. If you are tight for time, the Neutral Bay ferry is one of the best for this bit of R and R as the round trip takes only half an hour. Unless the rain is pelting down you enjoy spectacular views of the Bridge, city Opera House etc: get some time in the fresh air to clear your head; and have a true Sydney experience as these are working, commuter ferries and not tourist attractions. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to all first-timers to Sydney. I have recommended to overseas friends when they are visiting and to a man/woman they have said the ferry trip was a highlight. And although I have been visiting Sydney several times a year for many years I still try to make time for a ferry trip when I am in town,"

Agree the train should be free - I don't see how you can pay for something so daggy. And the monorail will be missed, as much as Sydney hated it, but Darling Harbour isn't quite the same without the poor old thing. Can get a bit tiresome with the 20-somethings after dark (once they learn how to drink, they'll be a lot more tolerable) but there are plenty of nice, cosy places to relax."

Resident at the Meriton, Kent Street we found ourselves a stones throw from the fantastic Darling Harbour. What a fabulous place. We spent almost every night there for dinner. We know that it is expensive but when you have saved for a holiday of a lifetime you go for it.We had some great meals there, dining at The Helm,various other eateries and one that became a firm favourite,South by Steyne. The whole place had its own magical ambience and we couldn't get enough of it.We enjoyed a lot of the attractions therein but also missed out on a lot. Amazingly we were sent details of another holiday to Aus which means we can't just visit Darling Harbour again but will actually be based there. This time it encompasses my partners 65th birthday and we will be lucky enough to spend another 21 nights there in February and March next year.Everything we could possibly want and another chance of a holiday of a lifetime."

It was one of our best meals of the trip! I forget the name of the restaurant, or I would post it too. You can eat and people watch or just look a the harbor. We walked across the bridge from the dock and went to the Hard Rock for dessert (I am on a mission to go to all the Hard Rock's in every country I visit) and then shopping in the attached mall. There are lots of things for families with children, many places to eat and so much to do. Definitely worth an afternoon or evening visit to Darling Harbour.

It has a fantastic shopping precinct with all sorts of shops from $ shops to cute boutiques and heaps of food places. The attractions were terrific, we bought a multi ticket that let us go to the tower, the aquarium, the wild life park the Manly Sanctuary and Madame Tussaud for about $68. Great value and 3 were located all together at Darling Harbour. The Maritime Museum was really worth a look and the big shops in the harbour were great to look at too! We ended up spending 3 days at Darling Harbour."

But, if you're at a loose end, the actual harbour is pretty and you may see dragon boat racing there, or paddle boarders, as we did. And in fact, that would be a much better way to see DH - by kayak or paddle board (though you'll needed to watch out for sharks!). The shops and restaurants themselves are overpriced & ordinary - for food, walk back towards the city and grab something from Chinatown for better quality & value."

Ferry under the bridge is amazing as is going past Opera House / Lady Mcs chair etc just get a completely different perspective than from land. As it eas winter it was blowin so need an extra layer than on land if you are on the outside decks but worth it. Take your camera - you wont be dissappointed!

The major attractions are the Aquarium, Madame Tussauds, Maritime Museum and the IMax theatre and the Chinese and Japanese gardens. Darling Harbour is really all of the above and the restuarants and shops dotted around the waterfront. Then there is Chinatown and the Casino neaby. It easlly accessible by bus ferry or light rail. Allow several hours to walk around and explore.Currently, (May 2014) the Convention and Entertainment Centre are undergoing a makeover so there are unlikely to be any major events here in the coming months.There is no entry fee to the precint, but attractions mentioned above have their own charges.Not sure about wheelchair access,lockers and buggy parking, but expect there will be facilities in keeping with the Sydney commitment to cater for all."

The restaurants along the footpath are reasonably priced considering it is a tourist hotspot, plus there is the option of cheaper fast food items inside also. Watch out for people on bikes though- there are many who speed by or try to do tricks when it is too congested with people to do so, and people are constantly trying to quickly dash out of the way so they don't get hurt. Hope to see Sydney council implement some sort of ruling here as we saw many unhappy tourists surprised the cyclists cutting in front of them of almost knocking them over at high speed."

Visited several times for lunch and dinner, the night before we came back home to England we went to watch the firework display which the have every Saturday night. It was fab to just sit on a nice warm evening watching this display which only lasted about 8 mins but was really good, thoroughly enjoyed my last night in Sydney at darling harbour."

You can take a picnic, get takeaway or visit a nice restaurant. There is plenty of space to sit and relax or for the kids to play in the park. You can play chess, table tennis or there are some lovely seats to sit and read or just soak up the sun. There is often a festival on, adding that special touch. Being on the water means there is always a great view. You can visit the aquarium or the maritime museum or go and watch a 3D movie at the iMax. You can even take advantage of the tranquility of the Chinese gardens. Nearby you have Chinatown and Paddy's Markets and the centre of the CBD is a quick walk.To me Darling Harbour comes alive at night. The city lights around it make it very beautiful and the views from the restaurants and hotels are superb. Would highly recommend. Just be aware that they are constructing a new convention and entertainment centre at the moment so there is some noise etc."

If you're on a tight budget, you can simply stroll around on a beautiful day and soak up the atmosphere and be entertained by buskers. If your budget is more generous, you could visit some attractions such as Sydney Aquarium, Wildlife World or Madam Tussauds. Or you can take a cruise from King Street Wharf and explore Sydney Harbour and get a close up view of Sydney Harbour Bridge. If you love good coffee or desserts, then you must visit Lindt Caf\u00e9 or Gelatissimo for delicious gelato. My favourite place is Imax where the films are a visual feast. If you park at Harbourside Carpark and see a film at Imax, you can have your parking ticket validated at Imax and park all day for a fixed nominal parking fee. Currently, there is a fireworks display every Saturday evening at 9pm at Darling Harbour, so it's a bonus if you're dining at any of the restaurants that have a view here on Saturday evenings."

Continued my stroll along the waterfront till I came to the Maritime Museum. I didn't go in but there were plenty of boats and ships, plus a lighthouse, outside to keep me amused for about 3/4 of an hour. Then I walked back to the top of the quay, round to the other side, just browsing, enjoying the pleasant surroundings. The aquarium is at the top of this wharf, opposite the Maritime Museum. There's an I-Max theatre and of course, there are lots of tour operators waiting to take you on a Darling Harbour cruise, neither of which interested me, so from here I strolled along the quay and over to the Chinese Garden of Friendship."

A main ferry stop from Circular Quay, this development is very modern and includes the Sealife Aquarium ( v good ), National Maritime Museum ( incl berthed vessels ) , Zoo, Pyrmont bridge, lots of cafes. Great views over the water to the other side of the harbour. A \"train\" will take you around the harbour for a small fee. Interesting architecture."

Great breeze across the bridge, while you go past ample amounts of bars and restaurants along Cockle Bay Wharf (although far too pricey), you can enjoy a few drinks especially during happy hours. On my second night on the wharf, we were treated to an open mic night and an impromptu fireworks display.there are lots of other attractions nearby - including the largest IMAX cinema and gorgeous \"sinking fountain\" which is great fun to try and walk down without getting your feet wet (we failed!). There are often street performers there who are masters of their art. We were treated to a comedic axe wielder.

If you are planning to go to Queensland or South Australia were you are allowed to hold koalas not pay to be photographed looking at a koala not worth the price.Darling Harbour has a light display in the run up of the New Year fireworks so good spot, doesn't fill up as quickly as by the brifge."

Unfortunately, when i was there, it was raining all day so i was not able to spend much time admiring the harbour, had to stay in most of the time but surely on a sunny day, it would be lovely to visit.

There are many 'living statues', street artists and singers providing entertainment. By dusk, as the city's lights start coming up, the place looks like a fairyland.

Had I come to Sydney and only seen Darling Harbour, I would have never come back to Australia. While I had a delicious steak at I'm Angus, the entire experience felt like I was at a grand food court at an outdoor mall. If you want to see thousands of people while you eat a steak, or have lunch at Baia where the rigatoni pasta was without flavor - this is your spot. Remember, you will also wait like you are waiting behind a thousand people. At I'm Angus, I never saw my server after he took my order. I gave my complimentary dessert coupon to the table next to me. It wasn't worth the wait.There are plenty of activities for families, and there are thousands of families. They are ready for you, and will charge for photos, keychains, etc. Bring your wallet.Had I not spent the first four days at the Westin, near the Four Seasons and the upscale mall, I truly would have been disappointed with my trip. Thankfully I only booked this area for an overnight stay. They have nothing to worry about with my review. This is built and designed to hold convention center crowds. And they will keep coming for sure... One more positive - I stood next to a Koala bear and he posed for a photo."

Maritime museum has a large variety of boats moored along side it's building and the immigrants wall is filled with names of all those who have arrived in Sydney Harbour from far and wide. A nice array of places to eat and drink with water lapping the docks and music playing. Great place for families!"

My partner and I wanted accommodation on at The Rocks and were a little disappointed when all we could afford was a place just outside Darling Harbour, but man were we wrong. In our opinion Darling Harbour is way better than the Rocks. There are tones of restaurants boasting all different cuisines from Thai to Spanish to Italian to Japanese and Australian grills. My partner and I were lucky enough to come to Darling Harbour during their Month of Love celebrations. They have lots of live performances in the evening and have strung up large balloons and lights shaped like hearts in the harbour in dedication to the month. At night the harbour was offering love boat rides on little row boats which were decorated in flowers and hearts. For $25 we got to row around for an hour - it was so romantic! They even had large white hearts anchored in the harbour so they floated on the surface of the water. At night they offered impressive firework displays to romantic music absolutely free it was such a romantic night i will remember forever! If you have time go this month to enjoy the love month celebrations!"

During our 5 night stay ate at various restaurants on Darling Harbour always having a good meal, the city views at night were fantastic. Be aware Darling Harbour is big so if you have any walking difficulties or young children there is a little motor train you can take to have a look round.

I was a bit worried about my son watching his first fireworks, but he seemed to be captivated by the sound and light around him. It takes a lot of effort to keep our son sitting one place for longer than 5 seconds, but the fireworks did that for almost 15 minutes. So, it was a great time spent."

Such is the size of the harbour that there are two ferry stops in the area which can tie-in with a visit to a particular attraction - one at the Maritime Museum, the other at the Aquarium. It is also home to the Conference Centre, a casino, Madame Tussauds and Sydney Wildlife World.The whole area is encircled with eating establishments although we found many of them quite similar - it\u2019s mostly casual dining on a large scale. If you tire of eating and the other attractions there is also some shopping behind the scenes in a large mall.There is plenty of open space and the area has some attractive landscaping so it\u2019s nice enough to just stroll around enjoying the atmosphere and take a walk over the Pyramont Bridge which crosses the harbour. Not many places to sit, unless you\u2019re comfortable on concrete stairs, etc - or happy to spend in the bars or restaurants.We had considered visiting the Maritime Museum however there was an entry fee of AUD$7 to the attractive looking building and this increased to AUD$25 if you wanted to include visits onboard some of the historic vessels moored in the harbour. We decided not to bother.The monorail was being dismantled when we were there and is presumably now gone.It\u2019s a likely destination for anyone with children (for the attractions) and worth a trip on the ferry from Circular Quay to enjoy the city landscape from the water and a wander around."

Surely this event has been going on long enough for the organisers to be able to get crowds moving - albeit slowly - without having a crush which was traumatic for two older travellers, one quite elderly. For heavens sake - this city hosted an Olympics! I was held up in what was, admittedly, a *somewhat* good natured crowd for well over half and hour - stuck. The Shanghai Bund on China National Day has nothing on this - a city with a population of the whole of Australia. All it would have taken, as I could see it, would have been some control to allow people to move slowly in one direction or the other. - barriers, security people - making it clear which queue to join to move in which direction. And they really must ban strollers. Strollers make the chaos worse. Families should come, but be prepared to dismantle their strollers and carry their children. Or ... the authorities must work harder to control the crowds.But ... the fireworks were - it must be said - spectacular. Was the effort to come from interstate for this event alone justified? I would say no. Other cities in this country also put on excellent skyshows on Australia Day.Just as well we had other things planned for our trip to Sydney which made the trip a great success over all."

There are many restaurants although none would be rated as fine dining establishments. That said you can get a good meal without breaking your budget if you take care to research the restaurants first. It's a busy place at holiday time so if large crowds are not your bag then stay away. Our group found the place fascinating and I would always recommend others to visit Darling Harbor at least once."

Yes, they are probably overpriced, but it is fun to be on Darling Harbour and there really is a restaurant for every taste and price range. This is where you will find Sydney Aquarium, Wild Life, and Madame Toussad's. We didn't go to these, but we were there for the fireworks at 9:00 pm on Australia Day. We sat on the edge of the pier in the pleasant evening air and enjoyed a very well done fireworks show. Leaving the show afterward was a crowded nightmare after, but that was a small price to pay for a great place to hang out."

First, it's not really a harbour. True, one of the Sydney ferries does stop here, but there is no mariana and no form of shipping other than small pleasure craft--not even yachts. The water is not an attraction here, the attraction--I guess--is the horseshoe shaped concrete quay around this small basin on which sit innumerable bars, cafes, restaurants, ice cream shops, souvenir stands, and an iMax theatre. And yes, the Sydney Aquarium is there. We walked around the \"harbour\" two or three times just to see what we were missing, and we never found anything that we would have been sorry to have missed. It all reminded me of a huge food court, like you might find at a major retail outlet in the USA--only bigger and with taverns. Part of the reason I liken it to a mall or outlet food court was the presence of so many teenagers--all very pleasant and well behaved mind you--but the fact that this place has a huge draw on teenagers gives you good idea what it is like. Unless you want to see an iMax film or are going to the Sydney Aquarium, I see no reason for a grown adult to make any effort to visit Darling Harbour."

Don't expect quiet place here as everybody goes here because it is convenience to go around and do what your family members want to do at one place. They even opened on New Year day while most shops somewhere else were closed on that day. They also have a train ride to go around and only cost $5 per person. If you find eating here too expensive, then you can ride this train to Chinatown which is close by and get something there. It is also close to Paddy Market where you can get cheaper price for souvenirs. For me, this place is great for the whole family members."

Also great place for kids for it offers a number of well planned out kiddie parks that looked really innovative and real crowd pleasers. thoroughly enjoyable evening."

It has nice rope-climb structures, swings, a big slide, a zip line (\"flying fox\"), a sand area with smaller slides, and a very nice water play area. There are also a teacup ride and carousel adjacent to the park. The public bathrooms around the area are clean.

It helped me beat the jet lag by offering me a huge selection of restaurants and shops in a nice environment.

The Convention Centre and Exhibition Centre together with the Entertainment Centre carpark are to be demolished in a jobs for boys scheme which will result in them being rebuilt over 3 years in a very debatable new concept.Darling Harbour has spent more time under construction or demolition in the last 40 years than functioning as a construction free zone. It's a pity since we have just enjoyed 3 dustfree years.The next stage, starting in 2014, will be the destruction of the Entertainment Centre which will be redeveloped to produce 1400 units over the next 10 years.So farewell Darling Harbour and hello to dust, noise and overshadowing high rise.

Originally part of Sydney's working harbour, Darling Harbour has reinvented itself as a tourist destination and city workers big space to repair to. There are precincts within the space that are special in their own right. The Chinese Garden, IMAX Cinema Complex; Convention Centre; the Aquarium; Parking; the Pyrmont Bridge; the Maritime Museum.; access to China Town; the Entertainment Centre; the Pumphouse Pub, just to name a few. Almost the Harbourside One Stop Shop! There are many restaurant options on both the City and the Pyrmont side. On the City side there is Coast, and Puri Cinta, as well as bars. On the Pyrmont side is the Darling Harbour complex offering restaurants, both indoor and outdoor, as well as shopping opportunities. On the water itself you will find water taxis and the odd water tourist. This is where the Boat Show is held each year. There are also boats on display to explore. To flesh out the space, you will find the mega buskers and at festive times quite a lot of really good Street Theatre. All this and you are still in the City. The space is well served by walkways, parking for cars, and the casual coffee seeker. If you find the space too large to comfortably get around, there are small precinct trains to assist you. Office workers use the space for lunch breaks or after work drink meet ups. Darling Harbour is used equally by tourists, visitors, locals, the city office worker commuter public. Bring your hat, your money and your camera. Leave enough time to enjoy."

Go there as soon as you can to see the current \"version\" of the harbour before another redevelopment starts in the next weeks for the next few years.

Darling Harbour is nothing special, its got all the fountains and fake grasslands, but lacks the appeal for myself to return or buy or consume anything. Again Darling Harbourside shopping centre is a mall its speciality overpriced shops are not worth it. Darling harbour has been recently transform its created a children's playground and has incorporated Commonwealth banks HQ making the area for business, boring!!. Compared to other places around Australia like Darling harbour. Melbourne's Docklands is much better with a DFO with shops you would consider buying from, side walk cafes, jetties to park the boat, ornaments and funky street furniture. Darling Harbour lacks that its more of a giant waste land were the express ways divert on top of you, corporations purchase huge amount of land for their boring business and giant playground that is more childcare centre for City workers and employees, and a lack lustre chinese garden. Southbank in Brisbane is a better alternative for playground or Docklands in Melbourne would be for sidewalk cafes. Allot of the pavement around Darling harbour is tired, tis like it stuck in the 80's they keep trying to update tit but I think it time to run the bull doze knock the shopping mall, the aging pedestrian bridge, all the cafes, the aquarium, the play ground the Imax, the eyesore entertainment centre and start again this place is a wasteland. if you want to go back in time in Australia Darling harbour hasn't changed since it was first built and to think this place is still used for major events."

Setting was nice, but a lot of the area looked like it needed a good scrub. The shopping mall/s needed lifting (same as all the rest) The Pyrmont bridge is a fabulous piece of Victorian Era engineering wonder and should be promoted...nice to see the monorail gone, shame about the graffitti and the aggressive cyclists on the bridge during the day. At night the drunken louts spoiled the place during what should have been an enjoyable warm late nights stroll...."

It was all really organised though and you never felt unsafe. Harbourside Mall is good too and there are heaps of eateries on both sides. Check out the Happy Hours at the bars and also the restaurants because you can get some fantastic deals."

Firstly, there is the harbour itself together with Cockle Bay from whence many day trips, short trips, whale watching, water taxis and Sydney Ferries are constantly departing and arriving.Then there are all of the restaurants and bars surrounding the harbour serving every imaginable type of food, especially seafood. For the children two small trains run continually around the periphery of the harbour. Then there are the permanent attractions: the Sea Life aquarium, the National Maritime Museum, an IMAX cinema, the Convention Centre, The Powerhouse Museum and the gardens with the ubiquitous ibis, the list goes on. No visit to Sydney is complete without a day spent in Darling Harbour."

There's a whole strip of new restaurants from different country origins called Darling Quarter and there is more available parking. The Cockle Bay Wharf is another strip of restaurants in the other side. There are so many attractions to visit like the Chinese Gardens, Madame Tussaud museum as well as The Australian Maritime Museum. You can also hire some speeds boats for a nominal fee to take you around the harbour and see the Sydney Opera House, Luna Park and the Harbour Bridge from the water. Passing under the Darling Harbour Bridge is also an experience not to be missed. Enjoy the restaurants overlooking the harbour. Try also not to miss the fireworks in the harbour on the weekends.

The festival turned out to be mostly food. With no indication of gluten content, we didn't stay at the festival for more than a few minutes. Our walk took us to a childrens park with water features. Beyond that, there was a zoo, a wax museum, an I-max theater, Gelato shop and cafe's without number.

I managed to stroll down to the harbor for dinner on the last day and found it to be a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.The harbor has a decent vibe about it. I actually spotted a large boat that was hosting a big party while it was docked at the harbor. That meant a fair bit of inebriated folks walking around. Luckily, no untoward incidents though.There was a Madame Tussauds museum and since the last admission was at 19:00, it wasn't very crowded. I noticed an IMAX and an aquarium nearby as well.There were a couple of souvenir shops but these closed relatively early. I don't think though Sydney has shops open late anyway.The main attraction of the harbor is the number of restaurants along the walkway. There is sure to be something for everyone."

While true it has a Madame Tussaud's, Hard Rock Cafe, Margaritaville and several other key landmark components that make the comparison worthy, it is also an unfair comparison in that the scope of public lands, parks, water features, pedestrian-features and orientation to the heart of the City make this combi-resident/tourist zone a substantially classier and cleaner component of urban life that Fisherman's Wharf might ever dream of being. The full scope includes the stunning Chinese Garden, Tumbalong Park and the Pyrmont Bridge in addition to the more touristy elements such as the Maritime Museum, Harbourside Shopping Centre, Exhibition Centre and the Convention Centre. The Cockle Bay Promenade is as lovely as any part of the Embarcadero excepting the beautiful view of San Francisco Bay. However, the stunning skyline of Sydney and the Darling Harbor waterfront along with the cuteness of Cockle Bay are nearly suitable exchange. We toured this section on foot in less than an hour as a side step from our walking tour of the Central Business District/Town Hall and Hyde Park areas. Well worth the stroll downhill via Market and then returning up Liverpool."

The one downside for me at least, is that they have removed the monorail. I loved that thing with the fire of a thousand suns. Sometimes I would just get on and go round and round, because I could. To me, Darling Harbour is incomplete without it. Now the only option you have to get around is to walk.

Definitely like to check this out on another visit. There is a 'train' which goes from one side of the Harbour to the other, kids would love it . We then walked to the other side, following the sun, Cockle Bay Wharf has a great range of restaurants as well as Sydney's Wild Life, Madame Tussaud's & Aquarium . Happy Hour was calling so we stopped for a drink. Had some dinner in China Town, about a 10minute walk and as there was a firework display we headed back for 07.30pm.

Darling Harbor is an extension of the city center with a mix of museums,shopping and open green spaces. It is without a doubt, the most popular and lively area of Sydney. Grab a swig of harbor oxygen and head for the Australian national maritime museum where you can explore the seafaring history of the nation. While on a nautical bent,the aquatic life of Sydney Harbor can be explore at Sydney Aquarium with its massive tanks and underwater walkway. Nearby is a wildlife exhibition with flora and fauna of the region. You are now in eating territory. Cockle Bay Wharf is a vibrant and colorful entertainment & food precinct. Work off the excess of lunch by relaxing at The Chinese Garden for a haven of peace and tranquility landscaped with winding pathways,waterfalls,lakes and pavilions. You could now head for the Powerhouse Museum which explores technology,decorative& domestic arts emphasizing Australian innovations and achievments. For a finale,head for harborside Complex with its array of views over the water to compliment the restaurants and bars that are found in this retail area."

Why tourists come here, I don't know. There are better bargains to be had in nearby Paddy's Markets and better (and cheaper) food anywhere else in Sydney. This over-rated confection exemplifies the brash, money-grubbing side of the Emerald City. The aquarium and National Maritime museum are, however well worth a visit. I am often here because I take my French classes to the Little Snail restaurant for excursions (now, that's a very good restaurant!) so I have become somewhat inured to the joint.

There are good numbers of beautiful looking, fully equipped boats and cruises on the harbour. You can have a close look of those modern high-tech boats. There is an aquarium, a 3d cinema/theatre (Imax), a geometrically designed fountain, Chinese garder, Sydney converntion center, harbourside shopping center and so many things.

Darling Harbour (DH) runs down the outside of Sydney's central business district and is home to a number of attractions and places of interest. It can be reached by foot, public or private ferry that leaves from Circular Quay. To start with the children, in particular the younger variety.At the far SW end of the DH district is a series of major playgrounds with all associated equipment (free) During the summer the water features are a hit but at all times of the year this is a place children can spend a day. Plenty of fast food outlets around not to have to cook for the day. Anchoring the Western side is the exhibition centre where major events are held however this facility might soon be pulled down for an updated version. This facility at the Northern end runs into three levels of shopping and eating options. The Imax theatre is also just around the corner from the playgrounds and also a hit with the young at heart. Then there are the multitude of restaurants and bars from every denomination.At the far Northern side of DH is the Maritime Museum which is worth a visit. It includes some old navy vessels that can be visited.Across the water from the Maritime Museum a short walk over the bridge are number of other places of interest: The Wax museum, Australia Park where you can cuddle a koala and the Sydney Aquarium are all on that side. This is also the place where you can catch one of many private boats that dart around the harbour during the day or evening.All in all a full day for DH is on the agenda if you have the time.HINT: Select a clear evening (preferably with a full moon) and have dinner at DH looking into the city (on the Western side of the water). The moon comes up over the city and looks spectacular. Oooh and don't forget to bring that ring if you wish to impress."

Harbourside as it is known is a collection of tourist shops and fairly ordinary food outlets in a rather dated building on the western side of the water. I understand it is due for a refresh before too long. The Novotel is on this side and beyond it the short walk up to Pyrmont or around the other bits of the waterfront towards the Star Casino make it worthwhile being across this side. The Maritime Museum is on this side too which is worth a visit. Also along this side is the Exhibition Centre which is big and empty if there are no shows on or bustling if there is something on and worth visiting. Heading south along this side takes you into Chinatown.The view back across to the city from Harbourside makes it worth the visit and the walk across the pedestrian Pyrmont Bridge provides easy access.On the opposite side of the water is Cockle Bay which is definitely worth a visit if you like to stroll and eat. There is an excellent selection of restaurants and bars along the waterfront over two levels. The tourist boats and some impressive private boats moor over this side so there is always something interesting to look at if you are seated outside during the summer. The promenade along the waterfront is always busy with people strolling up and down.The Aquarium is on this side. Again, this is worth a visit. The access from the CBD to Cockle Bay is an easy walk.If you walk north along the waters edge you will come round to King St Wharf which is another strip of excellent quality eating establishments. Beyond King St Wharf they are building the new Barangaroo precinct which will not be ready for some time. Because of this you need to leave the waterfront and go along Hickson Road if you want your after dinner walk to take you round under the Harbour Bridge and to The Rocks. Either way it's not far, it's level and the sights are great, particularly on a summers evening."

Though many people will say its opera house, darling harbour had been the center point where all cruises leave, star casino is there and childrens playground , in special events there is fireworks and stall delaing with culture and arts. All in all I never get bored going here any number of time . For tourists sydney aquarium, wildlife park and star city casino is there , there are various hotel nearby too Novotel IBIS, monorail station and markets too. All in all I think Darling harbour is the heart of the city and Imax standing tall is a good point to see 3D movies or if nothing else just sit by the steps near the water and enjoy the sunlight the tourists, boats and lot of time music ..I love Darling Harbour"

Great restaurants - of course! Some are fine dining and naturally quite expensive, but if that sort of eating is not on your budget, there are so many alternatives. Many of the eateries have outside dining and display their menus out on the footpath, so very easy to choose. Various attractions for the kids, Tumbalong Park - often used for cultural and sporting events, the harbour itself with its water taxis, ferries, and other boating activities. I recommend this venue for Australia Day but get there early as it will be standing room only for the fireworks displays."

Situated on a horseshoe-shaped bay, this is a pleasant walk and a great spot to see the Sydney skyline from a completely different angle. It is a 15 minute walk from the heart of the city. The biggest movie screen in the southern hemisphere is found here too at the IMAX theatre. Many options are available for every craving of the food and beverage kind. From simple take-away gelato to towering seafood platters, it is all here! The National Maritime Museum is located at one end and it too is well worth a visit (entry fee). There are Naval vessels moored there, from antiquated replica tall ships to stealth submarines and the historical tour inside is fascinating. To cross from one side to the other by foot, the walker is treated to not only great views but also a short stroll, over one of the last operating 'pivot-bridges' in the country. The bridge periodically swivels to afford ships with tall masts entry to the refuge of this little harbour. The best value for food is found in the food-court inside the 2 level mini-mall located beside the convention centre entry doors. This is a great spot for lazy fish & chips, a high-end sit down dinner, a cold beer, a pleasant coffee or take in a movie. Great walk from the main hotels. Well worth the easy effort. There are countless shops to pick up everything from beautiful photographs to authentic Australian keepsakes. Highly recommend."

We got off the ferry at the Darling Harbor stop planning to walk around to the Maritime Museum and possible go into the Aquarium. It was a school holiday and we quickly learned that all of the museums and attractions would be very crowded. So we took the monorail around the periphery to see what that was all about then got off at The Maritime Museum. Spent the entire day there and wished we had started there earlier. It was the best museum we visited in Australia. From the ships outside to the exhibits inside, it was a 5 Star experience. Great for old and young. You need to be able to walk for the outside exhibits but many things handicapped accessible inside. DO NOT MISS THIS ATTRACTION!!! Darling Harbor is very touristy and great for families. I am sure there is great night life for young people. Easy access by ferries or busses or monorail."

The Vivid Sydney Festival started on the day we arrived. This is a fortnight long festival show casing some of the best spots in CBD like Harbour Bridge, Opera House, Darling Harbour coming alive with beautiful lights, laser shows and projection videos. Darling Harbour has a lot to offer to visitors. It has a wide range of restaurants, shops, an IMax theatre, a Chinese Garden and a market (Paddy's Market) which sales a range of stuff at very cheap price. We enjoyed aquatic shows (light, music, laser and water display) every evening. The firework every night was spectacular. As it has a number of transport options including monorail and ferries going to other places is very easy. I recommend every visitor to Sydney to spend at least a day at this happening place."

In fact it was the first place we visited having arrived earlyish after flying in from Hong Kong. We wanted to go for a quiet stroll to get us into the Sydney atmosphere and this made an ideal start to our visit. It was a lovely sunny morning, great for a stroll, and we even got to go on the soon to be dismantled monorail. During our time in Sydney we went back to visit the aquarium and also to go for an evening meal with relatives when we got to see it all lit up. Nice to see all the families walking around enjoying themselves in what looked to be a clean and safe family environment. Well worth spending some time there."

The restaurants however whilst providing good views over the harbour are uninspiring and over priced. We had identified a number potentially to visit but on inspection left us totally underwhelmed. The Saturday night fireworks may be a reason to go then and pay the price. The IMAX at the time had absolutely nothing on that would attract. We spent 2 hours there and most of that was looking round the retail shops. Been there, done that will not be going back!!"

I'm proud of Australia as a whole, HOWEVER.... When recommending the place to overseas family, I tell them to only stay maybe two days in Sydney and move on.... Tick Opera House and bridge off the list but skip the Bridge Walk... It's wayyyyyyyy too over-priced and targeting the well-heeled Asian tourists who seem to splurge on everything.... (Currently in London and toured the London Shard & The Eye which are similar and prices are way more on the money).... Try having dinner instead at the revolving restaurant at Centre-point tower.... Kings Cross is just as seedy as thirty years ago, Bondi is just a beach after all and not a great one at that.... Much much better up and down the coast..... ESP the north and south coasts....We travel yearly to the UK, Europe, Canada and Pacific regions so comparisons are made with tremendous amount of OS experience ...All in all, Darling Harb is a two hour visit (including a quick meal) at best and that's it.....

Be wary - this is a touristy area so prices are slightly inflated. Also, many places have a surcharge if you eat on Sunday.When I was there, they were doing Fireworks every Saturday at 8:30PM. Not sure if this is seasonal or not.The Circular Quay ferry gets you here in about 30-45 minutes (because of other stops, it would be faster to walk from Circular Quay), but is an enjoyable ride that takes you under the Sydney Harbour bridge and brings you close to Luna Park. Very good for night ride. Be wary the last Ferry typically leaves between 10-10:30PM so plan accordingly. There are many taxis, and it is still a short enough walk from everything (including Wynard Station - about 10 minutes).Attractions in the area include Madame Tussauds, Aquarium, and Zoo (all owned by same company).Darling Harbour also hosts the worlds largest IMAX.

My wife and I spent a day in the Harbour; first with a morning coffee cruise and then the balance of the day in the Harbour area just people watching and sipping a good glass of wine. On an impulse, we decided to see if we could get reservations for a tour of the Opera House on the following day. Turns out they had a tour leaving in five minutes and could accomodate us then. We took the tour and returned to sit and people watch. Beautiful downtown skyline, great views of the Harbour ferries and the Ocean Liner wharf. The Celebrity Solstice was tied up there on that day and we had disembarked in Sydney at the same place two weeks earlier from the Ocean Princess! All in all, a beautiful place to sit and watch things go by or join in the action!"

A little like Bonfire of the Vanities. But then they developed it in a masterful way. Now everyone goes to visit the entertainment, and the bevy of stores and restaurants for all tastes. Though it's \"touristy\", it is not all overpriced. Entertainment and great views of the cityscape and the harbour. The Maritime Museum is here. The nearby Paddys Market is where you can buy your inexpensive T-shirts and other souvenirs."

What they could do with big and small hoops was amazing. The Trapeze act was both brilliant and scary for those watching and the balancing act of chairs and glass bottles unbelievable. We are so lucky to have some amazingly talented people in this City let alone Country. The Dangles have a website we have been told, and if given the chance go and catch them in action just as we hope to do sometime soon."

That being said, it is a good place to take the kids as there is a lot to see with plenty of eye candy. If you are on a budget, you can take the free city bus from downtown a few blocks from Circular Quay, and get off near Darling Harbour. Once there you can walk along the water, take in the many sights, and have lunch at one of the many good restaurants. After lunch we walked back to Circular Quay along the water and through The Rocks, which is a great 2-3 mile walk."

Besides that, the harbour has the zoo (do not recommend it), aquarium, and wax museum. Seems like a good place to take your kids."

There are so many places to eat or just sit and watch the world go by. The IMax Theatre and Chinese Gardens are worth a visit and if you have children, the play area at Tumbalong Park is a must. There's a little train service which does a circuit of the harbour going all the way along to the Chinese Gardens for $5 per adult. Other places at Darling Harbour include Madame Tussauds, Sydney Aquarium, The Maritime Museum and Wildlife Australia. The monorail is handy to use though I believe it's leaving Sydney within the next few months which is a shame. You can board cruise boats there too - so much to do in one area and I haven't yet mentioned the shopping centre."

Also has an array of activities from Chinese Garden of Friendship, aquarium, maritime museum plus many others.

We ate in a fish restuarant sitting outside and enjoyed watching everyone 'promenading'. The food was good but we thought it was expensive, as was the case with most places we ate in Sydney. As dusk fell, street entertainers came out and we enjoyed watching dancers, magicians, musicians etc. After we has eaten we joined others sitting out on the harbour steps to watch the firework display - which was pretty spectacular. Everyone was so friendly and there was a party atmosphere. Our hotel was a short walk away and we stopped for an ice cream on walk back which made the perfect end to the evening. Great childrens play area close by too, with loads of unusual things to keep them occupied. Would definately go back here if we go back to Sydney,"

The only niggle I had was the price of food. I had fish and chips and my boyfriend had a burger and it cost us \u00a350.00!!!! The drinks are quite cheap. But then again we were in a city and in the quay too. Overall we enjoyed the time here and I would visit again."

And then there's the tourist attractions, the Sydney Aquarium, Wild Life Sydney, Madame Tussards etc, something for everyone. I was there the day the rubber duck came into the Harbour for the Sydney Fest, very cool to see 60,000 people show up to see it that day. During certain times of the year there are events lined up and fireworks on Saturday nights. Check out their website to see what exciting events will be during your visit."

The incongruity of a huge yellow duck floating next to workaday ferries and sleek party boats added this element of ridiculous cuteness to a place already teeming with cute kids and their parents, not to mention an adorable real koala asleep in a eucalyptus tree outside Madame Taussauds. Darling Harbour has a great little amusement park for young children, with a carousel, playground, and various attractions geared toward families. Best of all, we went on a Sunday when the Family Fun Day pass is just $2.50 (Australian) per person to take the ferries all over. Definitely the bargain of the whole trip! Easy walking with a stroller, lots and lots of places to eat, lots of things to see."

I was later told when in Sydney and you're dining out, if you want tap water, you need to ask for it so that there's no confusion Kids got an ice cream but we struggled to find bins There are a few public bins but not enough for the amount of people in the area. This concerns me. No wonder the harbour is spoilt by the amount of litter that makes its way into the water Choose the day and time you visit. We visited in Jan 2013 on a Sunday around lunchtime. It was very busy. Photo ops are difficult under such crowded conditions. I would revisit late in the afternoon or early morning to avoid crowds"

The monorail passes overhead (not for much longer though, as it's been sold and is due to be dismantled) and all types of watercraft come in and out the harbour .. a bonus is to see the Pyrmont Bridge open when a larger boat has to enter. There's playgrounds for the kids and often themed attractions during festival times. Parking and accommodation are both available but the prices can be expensive.

We ordered beer. not because we couldn't afford a Magarita, but we just don't like being \"gouged\"!! My coconut shrimp was so overdone, it was unrecognizable as shrimp. Inedible. We were three grown women. We were seated at a lovely table overlooking the harbour. this was an inside table as the outdoor tables were all taken. Within fifteen minutes we were \"surrounded\" by screaming children, the hosts having seated three families all around us. To say our meal was ruined would be an understatement. I LOVE children, but it was poor judgement to do that to us. We have the right to enjoy our meal, as much as the next person. The proper thing to do, would have been to offer us a table \"outside\" as one became available. Not to subject us to a kindergarten setting in the first few minutes of being seated!!"

Which is a shame as there are still a lot of people like our party who don't want to buy that type of thing. The food court was packed and people waiting around like vultures for you to leave so that they can pounce into your space. Its OK if thats what you like but I would prefer a little time to converse with others and eat your selections - which really aren't any typical Australian foods for tourists to try. - you would think that they would have some typical Australian food like a Bar BQ (the smell of a bar bq cooking is unbelievale and would soon draw in the mouth watering crowds or Harry's pies etc However the grounds, street entertainment, the cool places and water displays are fantastic and a very welcome spot on a day as hot as it was the day that we were there. It was also great to see a new entertainment arrive and that was a gigantic yellow duckie. Our visit here was very hot, crowded and not many places to sit but it was still great to walk around and do some site-seeing in. Just remember to take the block-out and a hat because ouside its hot and you could easily get burnt. We were parked in the parking station which made it easy, although you can also get there by the monorail or the light rail train going to the casino and the train stops are fairly close to the harbour and entertainment areas."

It also had several different sized slippery slides, a flying fox and climbing gym.

Just outside the mall is a clock-like fountain you can walk down if your feet get hot and tired. Beyond the fountain, there is usually a street show going on like a dance troupe, musicians, magic shows, etc. Around the corner from the Starbucks and Imax is Tumbalong park, which has one of Sydney's greatest playgrounds. Though it can get quite crowded and the wait for certain attractions is chaotic, it's still worth visiting if you go early and during the week. The Sydney Sea Life Aquarium has undergone many updates and Sydney Wildlife is a nice place for a rainy day. I wouldn't pay the price of admission alone here, but if you buy it as part of a bundle, it is a good value. The bundles include admission to Sea Life, Madame Tussaud's wax museum, Sydney Wildlife, the Manly aquarium, the Sydney Tower, and some attraction in another state. Also in Darling Harbour is the Australian Maritime Museum. I just yawned typing that, but we only went to get out of the rain. They do have (fun?) exhibitions during school holidays and you can tour a submarine, and old schooner, and a naval ship, but the price is pretty steep if you're bringing the whole family. On a side note, the best way to get here is by ferry, but it's also accessible by bus, lightrail, and monorail."

It's a cool summer, so I liked the chilly breeze at daytime. You will also find many eateries and Harbourside mall to shop at. Wildlife and the Sealife Aquarium is also situated by the Harbour. Catch a ferry, buy some souvenirs and by night, watch the Harbour lit up with beautiful lights. This Dec, there's fireworks every Saturday night. Reminds me of Clarke Quay back home, but the walkway is much more spacious at Darling Harbour. Gives decent space for a good stroll."

This was a never-ending visual feast of beautifully landscaped vistas with a brief introduction, either by sight (a wall opening or moon gate) or sound (falling water), to a continually changing view. This, we agreed, was the highlight of our visit to Sydney. Avoid riding the small tractor-driven train ride around the harbor unless you have a very strong back--walk it instead. There are a plethora of shops, restaurants, and the Sydney Exhibition Center and Convention Center, plus an unusual children's play park here."

Darling Harbour does seem to be filled with very expensive restaurants and bars and the attractions like the aquarium and the navy museum seemed very overpriced so we just wandered around the walkways. This in itself is fun to do as there is lots to see (the submarine in the harbour was probably our favourite) and there's lots going on. We watched some street performers and had fun in the fountains. Great place to meander through."

Lots of dining options, with an entire row of restaurants facing the harbour. Harbourside Shopping Mall offers great restaurants and a food court. And although it's not a big mall, we loved the late night shopping till 9pm daily. Don't need to wait till Thursdays ;-) The IMAX screen is the largest in the world, and the kids would love the films there. The adults however feel that there could be more movie choices instead of the same documentaries. There's a really nice playground just outside IMAX, and the kids were happy playing while the adults were happily drinking coffee at Starbucks. We caught the Xmas fireworks. Pity the Xmas music could hardly be heard."

The last time I was at Darling Harbour was 8 years ago and it was a good walk through to get from point A to point B. This time I was pleasantly surprise to find a the new play area which had some super cool 'toys' to play with - such as a giant slide, rock climbing, a zip line (super popular with the kids), a water maze structure, giant swing, huge rope climbing maze, sand pit etc. The young and active can spend a long time here. My boys played for more than an hour and we actually came back another day to enjoy the playground. For the older ones chaperoning, they are many places to sit and to enjoy free wifi. Also easy access to the bathroom and if you are hungry there are many options, including a McDonald's nearby. Truly an ideal place to hang out. Tip: Bring along a change of clothes for the children because they will be tempted to get wet. Also try and go during the weekday since it is jam packed during the weekends."

The level harbour side is easy to negotiate, important if you are using a push chair or are accompanied by toddlers. Prices at the many and varied waterside restaurants are on the high side, however. With an eye on the past, the National Maritime Museum is well worth a visit but souvenirs are expensive. At one end of the harbour is a terrific children's play area with high quality apparatus. It is entirely free. One particularly popular feature there is a system of shallow water courses, where kids can change the direction of flow by using sluice gates - great fun for our 4 year old grandson. There is quite a lot to entertain younger children, including a train ride and older ones seem to enjoy negotiating a spiral, stepped water staircase along the north side of the harbour. This is a lively and sometimes very noisy venue with music blaring out from some of the restaurants. Special events are often staged there as well. Each Saturday evening, visitors are treated to a superb fireworks display, lasting around half an hour. All good fun and well worth visiting."

Recommended to take a ferry from Central Quay to Darling Harbour to take pictures of the Sydney Bridge from afar as well as underneath the bridge and Opera House as well as the approach to the harbour. The harbour is in the form of a horseshoe with shops, food outlets and parks and gardens around it for a nice stroll both during day and night. I was really impressed with the children's play area where technology was presented in such a unique way for kids to learn and apply hands-on."

Loads and loads of creative tasks that involve water..waterwheels, pumps, waterfall, lots of machines the kids can turn, hit, jump on, pull....all to get the water flowing into the next part of this very large game. Just near this area is a couple of coffee shops...if it is a fine sunny day, try Taste as they have good Campos coffee and the outdoor tables are right near the play area so you can watch the kids. BUT if it is cloudy and grey sky don't bother as the interior of this coffee shop is messy, feels grubby and is very dark. When I was last there I asked the staff to turn some lights on as it was very stormy outside and the room was very, very dark dark. The staff member tried one lamp..said \"oh the bulb must have blown\" and went away never to be seen again. I am normally a fan of this company Taste - their other restaurant are very well run but this one is a big disappointment."

I'm a Sydneysider and i'm reviewing Darling Harbour because it's marketed as a key tourist destination but your experience of it will vary significantly unless you pick a venue / activity and date that works for your needs, and I know when I travel o/s I appreciate honest help from locals. The bad stuff first: Darling Harbour is widely derided by Sydneysiders and often regarded as a 1980s town planning disaster, full of kitsch mainstream tourist attractions and a now decidedly shabby looking shopping centre, with the usual tourist horrors like a \"mini train\" and human \"sculpture\" performers (ugh!) Note: shoppers should head to George St, Pitt St, Market St and Castlereagh St for high-end mainstream shopping, or King St Newtown for alternative shopping. Darling Harbour has a freeway running through it which physically disconnects it from the city proper (you approach via series of bridges) and serves to give it an isolated atmosphere. That said, there is a lot of work being one to improve it including a rebuild of the outdated convention centre as well as reconstruction to rid some of the more 1980s aspects of the attractions. Families with small children are served by a good playground with fountains kids can splash in and the aquarium and maratime museum are also good for this segment. The Powerhouse Museum is pitched at children but check their website for frequent adult-orieneted exhibitions (eg Kylie Minogue's wardrobe, various fashion, music and photographic exhibitions). Singles and couples will likley prefer the King St Wharf side which has excellent bars and dining on the water and is away from the maddening crowds. You can reach these by foot from the northern CBD. The southern end (family central) frequently has free concerts (jazz, blues, rock) in summer so it's worth doing an online search before you get there, especially if you have limited time in Sydney. Pyrmont is a historic inner city suburb at the western edge of Darling Harbour which is well worth a visit for its excellent pubs and restaurants. If you are visiting late at night be aware that the casino is right there and can be dangerous with drunk angry people who've lost their money at 2am looking for a fight. Perfectly safe during the day and early evening. A few blocks further west and you are at the Sudney Fish markets - extremely recommended. Enjoy and stay safe."

There are a large range of tourist, eating and drinking activities with a large selection of bars, restaurants and other activities including a fascinating water park for kids and adults, and an activities park with ropes, swings etc for kids. Ready access by foot, monorail (until 30 June 2013) and Light Rail, and huge car parks under the Ibis and Novotel Hotels on the western side. Luckily we live here and enjoy it every day, but for others it is well worth visiting, allow at least half a day and come for a drink, a meal, a film, play in the arks, a stroll around, and on most Saturday nights - the fireworks."

On one side you have Cockle Bay and it's attractions such as restaurants, Imax theatre, Madame Tussauds, Wildlife and the Aquarium. On the other is Harbourside Centre which is a mall with many restaurants outside. There was a good range of shops in the mall from clothes to souvenirs, however the souvenirs are very overpriced and can be picked up cheaper in the markets and Chinatown (one item was $30 at Harbourside, $10 at the market). There are lots of good eateries in the Harbourside Mall, from healthy, fresh and reasonably priced food court food, to restaurants. The mall doesn't open til 10am so it can be a bit boring, but Pancakes on the Rocks restaurant opens at 7am which can fill in some time. The food is reasonably priced but it is hard to find."

Darling Harbour is a great place for meeting friends there are numerous easy landmarks to meet at, lots of choice for somewhere to eat, and lovely scenery to wander around and look at. I will be coming back with the kids as the number of free child friendly things to do was fantastic."

You can also find an aquarium, Madame Tussauds and similar attractions. A bit further south, you can find chinatown and Paddys. Paddy's Markets is a must if you're looking for souvenirs, don't look anywhere else. They sell the same souvenirs at quarter price that other shops around Sydney. So keep your souvenir shopping until you get here, and you will find everything you want, from Kangaroo leather to Opera house miniatures."

My kids love the fire work by Harbourside Shopping centre, Maritime Museum which featuring its Submarine and war ship. While in Madame Tussauds we took pictures of the famous people in the world which includes US President Barrack Obama, Australia PM Julia Gillard and famous celebrities i.e Kylie M, Michael J and Angelina Jolie. The night ferry ride from Darling Harbour to Circular Quay was very interesting with nice view of Luna Park and Sydney Opera House. I think the place should be in a must do list on any trip plan."

Not a lot to offer by day or night, unless you like drinking with 'suits' on friday nights around King St wharf side. Lacking character, there is no real life here. Best thing to do is: get a local government ferry from here to Circular Quay. The ferries are the wonderful. Or if you have the misfortune to be stuck in Darling Harbour then the childrens playground area, spiral water feature or Chinatown nearby are recommended. There are many, better areas of Sydney around the harbour than Darling Harbour, don't get caught wasting time here."

If you go earlier in the evening quite a few of the restaurants have early bird specials. Can feel a little empty at times, but if you are there when an event is on the place can be packed.

You'll aslo find an aquarium, an iMax, yet another shopping mall, and a casino in this area. The best thing to do is take a stroll to take in the sights and people watch, maybe a beer at one of the outdoor bars, but head elsewhere for a full meal."

Our kids enjoyed the free entertainment and the playground was a huge hit while we relaxed and watched them enjoying themselves. Saturday night 8.30pm fireworks were great for young and old and easy to see from various locations. The toilets were clean and we didn't find any line ups on either Saturday or Sunday.Lots of food outlets from the usual McDonalds, KFC etc through to really nice restaurants, something for everyone for every occasion. HINT - if visiting the city on a Sunday buy the $2.50p.p ticket for unlimited rail, bus and ferry trips, great value."

Lots of restaurants, bars, and cafes. The aquarium is also located down here and a few other bits and bobs. The monorail stops here and can be worthwhile catching if you are a visitor to Sydney (stops at places like Paddy's Markets) and gives a good view of the city. You can also catch some ferries from Darling Harbour but only selected lines. I like to come to Darling Harbour for a walk around (over the bridge and along the wharfs) if I am down that end of the city. However, overall as a destination I don't find there to be that much to see and do (unless you want to visit the aquarium or animal park). There are better bars and restaurants elsewhere in the city, but nonetheless you should visit Darling Harbour if in the area."

Monorail ride from Darling Harbour is not vey expensive (5AUS$) for the full ride and is interesting but not very exciting except crossing the bridge.This is also the place you find the Aquarium which is impressive, espacially for white sharks and the great barrier of coral room."

Over the past 10 years the area has developed into an iconic area, which includes shopping, festivities, tourist attractions plus scenery. Starting from the Northern end of Cockle Bay walk down the boardwalk and see the many glorious restaurants which over look Darling Harbour. Stop in the centre for a couple of hours and experience two hot attractions, Sydney Wildlife World and Sydney Aquarium. You can even meet two of only five captive Dugongs at the Aquarium! Continue on down south and venture past more restaurants, before stopping at the IMAX theatre. The walk then splits and goes westerly where you can venture to further restaurants (including Hard Rock Cafe) or Harbourside Shopping Centre and the Maritime Museum. Otherwise conitune venturing south past and you can visit the Entertainment Centre or Chinese Gardens. This is a great day out, and one could spend at least two days exploring! Only the person who ventures can be the judge of that."

Last day in Sydney, much cooler today so we took ourselves over to Darling Harbour to hit some of the museums - had also planned to hit the Aquarium but didn't make it (not worried since we are going to the Great Barrier Reef on Tuesday.) Started off going up in the Sky View Ferris wheel to get a nice overall view of the Harbour and the Chinese Friendship Garden - could see a wedding party getting photos taking. Then walked over to the Powerhouse Museum as they had been advertising this Sydney Design exhibition all over and Ron was excited to check it out - \"False advertising\". The Powerhouse looks like a great place to go if you have kids under 12, it is a bit like a mini-museum of science and is very much about how things work. Most of the \"design\" display was artist making things that looked \"lacey\" it was a large museum without a lot of stuff in it, $10 was too much, 1 hour was too long. We were more than ready for lunch when we got out of there.By comparison the National Maritime Museum is free and fabulous! (there is a fee to go on the ships docked outside but we didn't do that) we went there specifically to see the exhibit on Scott's last expedition to the South Pole - it was a successful failure - he made it, but the Norwegian Roald Amundson beat him there by a month so he wasn't, and then Scott and the other 4 men with him all died on the way back, but they all kept journals which were found with them 6 months later so we know exactly what happened - fascinating. It takes a special kind of crazy to do what they did. It was also very interesting for me since we went to Norway wen I was 10 and I remember (albeit vaguely) being in a museum with triumphal displays about Amundson's successful bid to be the first to reach the South Pole.We also had a guided tour through the rest of the museum by a volunteer docent who took us around - they even have a US gallery to show the close ties between the US and Australia formed during WWII , saw the display of a German who did not wish to stay in Hitler's Germany so he somehow KAYAKED! to Australia where he was promptly interned with the rest of the germans fort he rest of the war but allowed to stay afterwards), and I actually got to go on board the First Lady which is the boat sailed by the first woman to sail solo around the world (an aussie!). Looks like a big boat fromt he outside but that is a tiny space to spend 6 months in ALL ALONE! Very cool.Started to rain alot so it gave us an excuse to try out the monorail and ride it back to our hotel - very cool. It runs at about the 2nd-3rd floor level of buildings, right above the sidewalks, and is about as noisy as a Prius!When the rain stopped we walked back to the harbour and had a final fancy dinner out at I'm Angus - I had a delicious Sirloin with garlic butter and mash and Ron had the grilled Barramundi special (local fish, very tasty). Then we went to the Lindt store for some more fancy hot chocolate - sadly I have been spoiled by that one taste of Italian Thick chocolate and even the Lindt hot choclate seemed thin."

There's some nicely landscaped parks and a nice water setting. This makes for a nice afternoon walk but I would not say it represents the real Sydney.Soon the monorail that runs through the place into the city will be dismantled. The Chinese Garden is interesting to visit if you have never experienced a similar place elsewhere. There is an admission fee for the garden."

We just walked to the harbour and enjoyed a leisurely coffee and breakfast at one of the numerous cafes there. We then took in the sights, some photos and walked back to the SCC via the Pyrmont Bridge. The facilities are great at DH with benches for seating, toilets walking, running and cycling paths as well as the shopping. Also everything is sign posted so it is very hard to get lost.

Water taxis are there to give you a view that is different. Huge screen theatres - so many exotic eateries and bars - fountains and at every turn something of photographic interest.

A great kid's area, lots of places to eat, fountains, docks, boat rides, the National Maritime Museum, the Sydney Aquarium, people watching, etc. We were just happy to walk around and sightsee. Having been in many aquariums and had already gone on a snorkeling trip to the GBR, we skipped the aquarium. Didn't go in the Maritime Museum either, but there was a huge navy ship and submarine docked right in Cockle Bay. Lovely place to walk around."

Darling Harbour can be reached via ferry from Circular Quay - a very pleasant trip or by mono rail from Sydney City.Once here you will find a huge number of restaurants - all very large and somewhat touristy with prices to match. There is also a big indoor shopping mall called \"Harbourside\". Sydney Acquarium, the Power House and Maritime museums are also situated here and well worth visiting (see separate review on Maritime museum). It is a pleasant area to walk around and there are lots of places to sit and relax and watch the world go by. There is a faboulous very large childrens play area and its FREE! the cafes/restaurants overlooking this are more reasonably priced than the ones overlooking the main harbour area.The ferry stops at two places here - Darling Harbour stop - best for Acquarium and Pyrmont - best for Maritime museum - these stops are on opposite sides of the harbour but it is a very pleasant walk to get off at one, have a potter around and then walk across the Pyrmont Bridge to the other side and pick the ferry up again there. Pyrmont bridge is accessible via lift, escalator or steps - so ok for puschairs etc.When visiting Sydney, you should certainly go to Darling Harbour but avoid week-ends - too busy and too many big noisy crowds in bars/restuarants!"

Other than that, save your money. There's a wild animal exhibit and an aquarium both located on the harbor. Size limitations dictate the poor animals be confined to tiny cages and ponds. It's sad, especially when Sydney has two other wild animal areas near by that offer the animals great range of freedom. In addition, the rest of the harbor is a combination of kitschy over priced attractions straight off the midway of any state fair, and wildly over priced (even for Sydney) restaurants. Even the Maritime museum is priced to the hilt. Come for a visit, but leave your wallet in your room."

There are loads of places to eat all around the harbour - another day we went to Hurricane's which is a great place specialising in burgers and ribs - you should book in advance to make sure you get a table - that was one of the best meals we ate whilst in Australia!

The off spring of an incubus comes to mind with the lager louts, freaks, emos and other 'diverse' members of our society that mainly patronise this historical, for all the wrong reasons, place in Sydney. I will give you a few clues of what you can expect to come across in that desperate part of the world. 1. The poor and original off spring of the original inhabitants of that area have colloquially re- named surrounding suburbs as Dyketown (Newtown), Junkiedale (Annandale) and Multi-blow (Ultimo). The area is best visited in daylight so you can see your assailant approaching and you can negotiate the dark and narrow streets in your frantic escape with some confidence. At night it is best to travel in the area in the front seat of a locked Police car driven and occupied by members of an assault SWAT Team. Helpful tips whilst visiting the area include; Do not look at people in the eye as the red glow of their eyes balls may be the last thing you see; Do not bring cash in the area unless your last will and testament is recent and legal and anyway you will need a credit card or cheque book to cover the bill for any food you may order i.e a 1 metre x 30cm pizza starting at $65 (Margerita) at one of the cheaper restaurants. Although the area is getting tired and old in a not so glamorous way the view of the harbour whilst in protective custody is still nice especially if the intoxicated occupants of the ferries and other vessels sailing past are not yelling abuse or flashing at you."

I hate the traffic but I love this harbour city and especially its many harbour front precincts like Darling Harbour, which allows locals and visitors alike to spend their day with family and friends either on a shoe string budget with a picnic or packed lunch OR at one of the many eateries surrounding the Darling harbour waterfront.On our last visit on Saturday, and the same on most of our other visits, we saw young children enjoying a swim in the man-made fountains and waterway features which criss-cross the walkways. Family and friendship groups either sitting on the grass or the many park benches and cafes dotting the area. We stopped in at the iconic Hard Rock Cafe for sustenance and to drink in the view after attending a Travel expo at one of the halls at the Convention Centre. Adjacent to Chinatown and with the Sydney Aquarium, The Cockle Bay Wharf area, IMax theatre, pubs, hotels, nightclubs, apartment blocks and eateries all sitting within the Darling Harbour locality, the area is abuzz day or night with residents and patronage especially on weekends of the many harbour cruises.Another inexpensive sightseeing item to add to any local or visitors list. If travelling by car we found easy access as we parked at the Darling Quarter carpark which was just $6 for all day Saturday parking and the lift deposited us right near the Chinese Friendship Gardens."

We were in a hotel that was about 15 mins walk from Darling Harbour and Harbourside so we visited every day we were there.It was the Chinese New Year celebrations and on the Saturday and Sunday they held the Dragon Boat races.Also for the month of February they are having a firework display on the Sat night at 9 pm. And Sydney does know how to do fireworks, as every New Year we see it on our teles.There are ferries leaving Central Quay for Darling harbour all the time and that gives you a chance to see the city from the water, Harbour side has a huge shopping mall and loads of eateries. from al la carte resturaunts to macdonalds,There is also the Imax theatre, an Aquarium and a small wildlife arena.There is also the Maritime Museum.In the evening you may have street acts, that entertain you.There are water features that are in the walkways that children can interact with, together with a huge childrens playground, that isnt frequented by druggies, or vandals and I can honestly say I didnt see any graffiti at all, not in the areas I went to."

You'll always find people just sitting around the harbour chilling or catching some sun. There's a lot of restaurants to choose from though be warned, it is a tourist area, so its a tad bit more expensive. If you go towards the Chinese Garden of Friendship to Tumbalong Park, there's a new huge playground a bunch of new restaurants too. Sometime in the afternoon, the street performers start setting up and perform for the crowds. The performances include riding a unicycle, juggling fire, balancing acts, hoola-hoops, etc. At night the harbour is at its best. The colorful lights reflecting on the water makes for an awesome photo-op. The bars & restaurants starts getting loud with music and talk from well-dressed folks having a few drinks. On Saturday nights at 9AM (I believe) they have fireworks which is always a crowd favorite."

My husband and I were at Darling Harbour on Saturday for jet boating (don't worry the boats move slowly around the public spaces so not noisy). Highly recommend the ride for the adventurous (or perhaps a more sedate water taxi, ferry ride, etc). My husband hadn't been to Darling Harbour before; I hadn't been for several years. I thought it was even better than my previous experiences (usually passing through to visit the attractions surrounding the harbour - aquarium, entertainment centre, powerhouse museum, Imax cinema).There are dozens of eateries and restaurants: (we ate at Pancakes on the Rocks - first visit, very good food - didn't even know there was one at Darling Harbour, too). Hard Rock Cafe; several seafood restaurants; floating restaurants; foods from many styles and nationalities; favourites like Subway. Some restaurants might be best booked if you want to make an early decision, have a group to accomodate, or if events are on that will bring in crowds.Most prices I saw were in keeping with the standard of the restaurants/shop (not expensive just because of location). Most restaurants have menu and prices displayed outside, so no surprises.Lots of boutique shops (to an Australian, everything seemed to be Australiana, but I've discovered shops here before that I would buy from, so take this comment with a grain of salt). Galleries, clothing shops, lolly shops, etc - good for a browse.There are usually museums and other exhibitions, but these will depend on schedules and when they are open. We were there on Sunday and weren't looking so you'd be best to look up some Sydney Tourism sites or specific interest sites to find out. There is a Chinese Garden which is very popular. The queue to get in was huge on Sunday but the recent Chinese New Year is probably responsible for that. We couldn't see a sign for price, etc, sorry.Now, for families...apart from the attractions mentioned before (which have entry fees) there is no end of things for the children to do...free. Extensive water play streams and fountains and a huge park with slides, climbing equipment, its own water play fountain, rides (don't know if there is a cost). Expect a crowd but everyone seemed to be having fun. Expect to be able to take a seat, but you'll need to monitor the kids, especially younger ones.There's a monorail station and the monorail runs above the harbour. I believe there are plans to remove this; we were surprised it was still there.And if a walk in the perfect Sydney sunshine is a bit much, many courtesy trains are running around, just hail the driver.We didn't see half of the area in the few hours we were there. It would be worthwhile to do some research or find a tourist map at the harbour to help see the things you want to see.Note: We parked in the 'Convention and Exhibition Centre' carpark as it was very close to where we were going. However as the centre was closed we had to exit the carpark along one of several corridors (marked as stairwells) which DID have a short flight of stairs to go up. This could be a struggle for disabled, families, elderly. On the way out of the carpark we saw signage for a disabled exit towards the other end of the carpark. Be aware if you have trouble with stairs as there is no signage at the Convention Centre end.Get there! You'll love it!"

There is also a shopping mall which has a variety of stores, including souvenir, clothing, and accessory shops.Darling Harbour is also home to the Australian National Maritime Museum (it wasn't open when we were at the harbour).We didn't have much time, but it looked like Darling Harbour would be a fun place to spend a day."

The Zoo and Aquarium were the only saving grace, educational and fun for kids / families."

The Aquarium is good - my favourite attraction there. Hard Rock Cafe has opened so that may attract more people to that side. The food court is average, just like any other food court.

Darling Harbour is a short ferry ride from Circular Quay, or a 5-10 min walk from Town Hall, or perhaps catch the Monorail. From Central you can catch the Light Rail - so there's a lot of options for getting to / from this area.The other venue that's perfect for locals and tourists is the Chinese Garden of Friendship at the southern end of the precinct. This is a peaceful haven in the midst of Sydney and well worth a visit.In addition, there are several hotels at Darling Harbour which are popular with tourists as they are often slightly cheaper than those at say The Rocks.For locals - all the above applies too. There are many events held at the Convention Centre which is at the south end of the precinct, not to mention the Entertainment Centre too."

The hop on hop off bus has two stops here, one behind the Aquarium and the other further along. We went to the Maritime Museum which was very good.

Many attractions are available in this area from cafe, imax, restaurants, nightlife, playground for kids, parks, office building, museum, etc.For families, the most interesting places to visit will be the maritime museum exhibition of the warship and submarine. Then the IMAX, then for kids under 10 years old, theres a new playground park with water play, sand, and many more.Every saturday night at 9 PM local time, a firework show is available for everyone to enjoy for free. Its awesome! The crowd went crazy when the firework starts and applause is always present afterwards.Hotels around the area are more expensive but made the journey here shorter. Considering taxi is a bit pricey in Sydney, the saving for taxi would compensate the additional cost for hotels nearby.Hope this helps."

Yes, there is calm water and an elevated bridge across the mid-section of the small harbor. We went one night to watch the free 10-min fireworks which are scheduled at 9 pm on some saturdays during the holiday seasons. The place is unique due to the combined magic of green parks, blue waters, open spaces, boats and yachts, and carnival ambiance among the various businesses. There are people but we didn't feel crowded like in other similar inner city attractions elsewhere. If the Opera House is the jewel of high culture, then Darling Harbor is the gem of the common people. Both have their own way of seeing and be seen!"

It's mostly just a collection of shops and restaurants along the water. The restaurants are pricey, so we never ate at any of them, and the shops are nothing spectacular. It's pretty similar to Circular Quay, but less pretentious feeling. I could see myself going there for some drinks to watch the game, or do some Christmas shopping, but it's not a place that blew my mind. There wasn't really anywhere to sit down and just enjoy the nice weather unless you sat on some steps, or a fountain ledge, or go to one of the bar patios. Nothing would prevent me from going back, but I would be fine not seeing it again."

From other reviews I can see that it is great location to stay as it is central to most everything and lots to do within walking distance. We skipped aquarium and wildlife park (teenagers not to into that stuff nowadays). We tried to catch an IMAX film but they were all sold out (on a Saturday). There were so many nice looking waterfront restaurants; I imagine it is a great place for a meal. We caught the ferry from Circular Quay to Darling Harbour so you are well situated to see many waterfront areas in Sydney. We did stroll through Chinatown and went to Paddy's Market on Friday, both interesting experiences and nearby."

We stayed in an accommodation in Circular Quay, located in between the Opera House and Darling Habour. The train station is just a walk from our apartment."

            "review": "This should be on your list of places to visit. This is one of the places in Sydney that you need to visit. Chances are you will at some point or other anyway as the hop-on hop-off cruises start from here, the aquarium is here, the explorer buses pass through and there is a wealth of museums and cafes to explore or eat at. There are some shops too I think but I didn't really look at them.Firstly lets just say the area is nothing overly special, however I've rated it above average as I think it's a place you need to visit when in Sydney. It is a nice area but it is just a quay with some good views. Having said that I really enjoyed just browsing around the area, looking at what there was to see, enjoying the view from the bridge over the harbour. I also visited some of the places around the harbour such as Sydney Aquarium.To get the best views go up to the top of the bridge that has the monorail going across it. You can get some really good photos from there and it's a good place to wait if you're early for a boat cruise or something.It's also not too far from the chinese area of the city so you can get some great chinese food, or visit the chinese gardens without having to walk far."

            "review": "Always something to see or do!. There always seems to be something to see or do whilst in Darling Harbour. There are a number of hotels overlooking the harbour (including the Ibis, Novotel, Mecure) which must offer great value views. There are wooden tiered steps down to the water which double up as great places to sit, sunbathe or just watch the world go by! Whilst not really an attraction in its own right - you will find plenty to do at Darling Harbour - including:Sydney Aquarium, Wildlife World, Maritime Museum, Powerhouse Museum, Chinese Garden and the Imax cinema. If you fancy a trip on the water you will be equally spoilt for choice: Sail with Olympic sailors on Sydney by Sail; Matilda Cruises offer a wide choice of trips including Taronga zoo, opera house, lunar park to name but a few; Harbour jet will whizz & spin you around the harbour at a scary 75kph; If you want a more sedate experience visit the naval ships and submarine within the national maritime museum - including Captain Cook's Endeavour and Destroyer HMAS Vampire - all really interesting even if you're not an avid maritime fan! There are also really groovy looking water taxis available or catch a ride on the Monorail which circles the harbour. There are restaurants surrounding the harbour, so plenty of choice and a shopping mall. If you want Paddy's Market walk past the water features and Chinese Garden and you will eventually find it! The whole area is a joy to walk around with lovely & unusual water features. Often there are exhibitions or street entertainers present. Its also very clean! It's touristy, yes - but it is an interesting part of Sydney that mustnt be missed."

Okay, so you're not going to find the best restaurants in the city, and you can expect to pay above average for a schooner of ale, but there is always something worthy of attention going on in Darling Harbour. Permanent attractions such as the Chinese Garden of Friendship, iMax theatre and Wildlife World are well worth a visit, and if you've already been there and done that you can guarantee that a wander through Darling Harbour on a sunny weekend will always nett a festival, exhibition, or something else equally interesting to grab your attention. Darling Harbour is a clean, bright, aesthetically pleasing, family friendly area, which provides a great backdrop and attmosphere for a lovely day out. Top off the experience by arriving or departing on the ferry which adds a romantic twist to any day out."

Visited the Aquarium, Paddy's Market etc etc and tried out a number of the restuarants. Can't fault most of them but give CMC ( Citi Marina Cafe) a miss. Shocking service, bad food, cold and almost raw food. A waitress who couldn't understand english. Totally disgraceful. Give Nick's a go for breakfast. Under the bridge on the Cockle Bay side is a cafe that has all lunch meals under $10-. This is the best low cost meal cafe on the harbour. Plenty of other great meals to be had in the area..just not CMC."

While I was there, I did a boat tour/sky tour of Darling Harbour, as well as trips through the Chinese Gardens, Aquarium, Torongo Zoo, and several museums. Needless to say, Darling Harbour and Sydney as a whole is a gorgeous city that needs to be seen by everyone!"
