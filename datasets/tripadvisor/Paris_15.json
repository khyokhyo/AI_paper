You can still see most of the outdoor sculptures and all of the museum, so it's worth going."

The most we love is \"THE KISS\" - what an impression! Rodin was a workaholic. His life work is immense. And it needed physical power with the hammer, chisel and spatulas. The house itself and the garden are beautiful. After three hours we were so imposed about the diversity of Rodin's work that we had to stop and we decided to visit the museum again at another time."

Later when the French government acquired the property, Rodin agreed to donate his own sculptures, photographs and drawings, as well has his extensive art collection, so that the mansion home could be turned into an art museum.The grounds of the Rodin Museum are beautiful and serene. Many of Rodin's sculptures are displayed on the extensive grounds. Most noteworthy is 'The Thinker' which has its own special alcove within the garden. The artwork and sculptures showcased within the museum are also impressive, including Monet, Renoir and Van Gogh! The Rodin Museum is also centrally located within Paris. The Varenne Metro stop is close by, and it features some of Rodin's sculptures on the platform. We definitely highly recommend the Musee Rodin when visiting Paris!"

Also queues are often shorter on Rodin so go there first and get your ticket and walk straight into d'orsay.You can also get a combined ticket to muses Rodin meudon for a little extra.The sculpture gardens are a delight to ramble around. For me the highlight was the gates of hell. Unfortunately never installed as the project never got built.Then inside the house is a selection of Rodin's carvings, castings and painting.It is well laid out and easy to view."

A lesser fee just for the gardens. The grounds have a beautiful sculpture garden showcasing several of Rodin's famous pieces that wrap around the gorgeous 17th century Hotel Biron. The mansion is stunning & holds 300 of his works & paintings he aquired for his own personal collection. We really enjoyed the peace & tranquility of the gardens as they wrap all the way around the building, We noticed the Invalides Gold Dome was visible from the gardens. We relaxed in the outdoor seating outside the cafe with a nice glass of wine. Food is available as well. Many of Rodin's more famous sculptures we have seen in Philadelphia but this museum showcases so much more. The museum opens at 10am daily with a late closing on Wednesdays."

Having experienced several days of Paris @ 30degrees we needed somewhere cool and green and shady.I had been into the museum several years ago so sent husband on a quick tour while I pottered round the garden. He soon caught up .... the inside was hotter than the shade in which I was enjoying the sculptures outside.While Rodin isn't a favourite one has to admire the life and movement he achieves in these beautifully presented outdoor exhibitsMost of all though was the cool elegant sophisticated garden layout. A little traffic noise was no problem at the average priced little cafe with cold beer or wine available and an ice cream kiosk too. No fumes !I just upped this review to 5 stars remembering how very restorative this experience was. There were chaise longues at the far end past the pond !"

Gorgeous sculptures throughout the beautiful garden grounds, and the hotel is filled with Rodin's works as well as some fine pieces of his apprenticed students. This is where Rodin worked and taught and collected his works for many years and he donated his art on the premise that they continue to house them provide such a tasteful display for the public. I visited with my wife and 9 year old daughter and we spent the entire afternoon there. They have a very nice cafeteria in the garden that made for a lovely picnic before our stroll around the fountain and wooded area where you will discover many fine Rodin sculptures outdoor year round."

            "review": "A Unique View of Rodin's Work. First, the museum is filled with impressive works by Rodin, which you will enjoy whether you are a fan of Rodin or not. His famous Gates of Hell is impressive in its own right, but the many full size versions of parts of the Gates of Hell are spread throughout the garden, including The Thinker, The Three Shades, and Ugolino and His Children. What I love most about Rodin, that you can see in many of his works in this museum is his ability to make his figures \"come out\" of the marble, by leaving parts of the marble rough hewn and still connected to the figures. Examples of this include \"The Kiss\" which exists in several materials in this museum, or \"Fall of Illusion: Sister of Icarus\" where the figure is carved partly into the underside of part of the marble with incredible detail.But, beyond that there is something unique that I appreciate most about this museum. For the most part, Rodin's work displayed elsewhere is mostly finished pieces. I've seen great works of his from the Hermitage in St. Petersburg to the Met in New York - finished pieces. What is especially compelling about this museum is the number of partially finished, unfinished or \"rough draft\" pieces. In the garden, there is a marvellous pair of bronze castings that were used in the build up to the famous \"Burghers of Calais.\" One is of a figure in the nude, where Rodin figured out the muscle, sinew and posture. Then the same figure was cast with clothing on. The final figure can be found in the full casting of all the Burghers. You will find similar progressions of busts or early versions of some of his best work (watch for Victor Hugo versions in particular). This gives a unique insight into the process of Rodin's art and is particularly compelling."

You can buy tickets for just the gardens. It is a lovely stroll, obviously amazing sculpture, but also wonderful trees and fountains. We bought the audioguide but found the commentary disappointing. I suggest a drink at the cafe in the garden. There were pastries and other things, we had coffee and a coke. The gardens were not crowded and it was easy to all the statues, walk around them and spend some time with each. The Thinker was the only one with a large group around it. As in most French museums, we were unimpressed by the museum shop. Restrooms were clean and large. We had a lovely visit and enjoyed the museum immensely"

It's very relaxing to wander about the grounds where you'll find many of his sculptures and a history about them. When you enter the museum it's well laid out as you'll learn more about the man, his life, the friends and contemporaries that inspired him and who he inspired. You'll find many of their beautiful and well known works of art inside as well.We used the Paris museum pass, it was worth it as it's also good for free entrance to many other well known museums in Paris.

In general, I would advise most people to try to live their lives in such a way as to avoid The Gates of Hell, but Rodin's sculpture of this portal is enthralling. Fortunately, one does not have to trebuchet a flaming kitten at a nun to gain admittance, but merely hand over a few Euros. Rodin also did a fantastic sculpture of a boy band called Les Trois Ombres. The museum also gives some insight into how the he lived and worked and has a sculptures and insight into Camille Claudel, his student, muse, and lover. She, herself, was also a brilliant artist and fascinating character. Also, as a museum it is exactly the right size. It has lots of great art and information and a clear focus, but isn't overwhelming. Another plus is that much of it is outside and has a lovely little area to have a cup of tea."

Not far from the magnificence of Les Invalides and Napoleon's tomb, the Hotel Biron and its gardens house this great collection illustrating the life, working methods and amazing output of Rodin. On a sunny day it was especially good to wander through the sculpture garden, and get close to some famous sculptures, and to take coffee in those surroundings. Inside, the exhibition is beautifully laid out through the rooms of the mansion,; and you come out with a greater understanding of Rodin's genius. Incidentally, Rodin believed that sculpture was a tactile art, and encouraged people to touch his works. I saw only one \"do not touch\" notice. It was on a statue in the garden of a naked man. One part of his anatomy was very shiny - I could see the reasoning behind the request!"

There's a cafe in the outdoor part as well, but it has a fairly limited selection.The indoor component is quite impressive, and I would urge visitors to watch the 2 videos near the beginning to show how Rodin prepared his sculptures and casts, and how he managed to scale to larger sculptures (for those who do not know). The remainder of the museum has an impressive collection of not only Rodin's work (and various steps of his process), but also some of the art he collected, including an impressive set of ancient sculptures. This museum isn't as busy as some of the more popular Paris attractions, and takes a couple hours to see."

The place is amazing and the museum includes a garden which is fabulous with outside art. Wonderful cafe with good food and drinks. It is easily accessible by Metro and uncrowded. If you only have time for one museum, skip the Louvre and see Musee Rodin. Worth it."

One of the finest gardens in Paris you can also buy just garden ticket and enjoy your time on benches around. I was the first time that I liked the audioguide. It had many information (which you can always skip), but the numeration was great and had a list of audioguided sculptures. Rodin had lived an interesting life and his works are the works of a genius! His number 1 fascination was Dante's Divine Comedy- and the sculptures I saw at the museum encouraged me to go back and reread it! The famous Kiss and Thinker are actually the parts of Gates of Hell masterpiece that he worked on for most of his life. His sculptures have the emotions and convincing nature. Though people were critical about his Balzac statue, now it seems as a masterpiece too. The rooms in the museum are divided into his life periods and this case it is very easy and interesting to see him grow from small works to big ones."

In high school I saw the movie Camille Claudel in a humanities class, and since that time I have wanted to see the Gates of Hell. The works in the garden are so powerful and often haunting enough, to be forced to look away. This is juxtaposed by my memory of Michelangelo's work, which wasn\u2019t so haunting but just incredible. For instance, how a vein would rise out of the forearm. It seems that Rodin\u2019s work, although not always as polished as Michelangelo\u2019s, conveys a sense of movement by not polishing every sculpting mark. I have no basis to make such comments, but the point is that this museum is one of the greats and should not be overlooked!"

It has two sites, at the H\u00f4tel Biron and surrounding grounds in central Paris, and just outside Paris at Rodin's old home, the Villa des Brillants at Meudon (Hauts-de-Seine). The collection includes 6,600 sculptures, 8,000 drawings, 8,000 old photographs and 7,000 objets d\u2019art. The museum receives 700,000 visitors annually.While living in the Villa des Brillants, Rodin used the H\u00f4tel Biron as his workshop from 1908, and subsequently donated his entire collection of sculptures (along with paintings by Vincent van Gogh and Pierre-Auguste Renoir that he had acquired) to the French State on the condition that they turn the buildings into a museum dedicated to his works.The Mus\u00e9e Rodin contains most of Rodin's significant creations, including The Thinker, The Kiss and The Gates of Hell. Many of his sculptures are displayed in the museum's extensive garden. The museum is one of the most accessible museums in Paris. It is located near a Metro stop, Varenne, in a central neighborhood and the entrance fee is very reasonable. The gardens around the museum building contain many of the famous sculptures in natural settings. Behind the museum building is a small lake and casual restaurant."

The audio guide added much to the visit so I recommend this as well.Rodin's sculptures are extraordinary - transmitting emotion and vibrancy - what a genius he was. So interesting to learn about his own feelings about his sculptures which changed considerably during his lifetime, his statue of Balzac being the culmination of his life's work, his legacy, capturing the essence of the man, not just a physical likeness."

Outside in the gardens on the entrance side are several bronzes including the \"Gates of Hell\" and in 90deg heat it feels just like it! What makes this collection so special is that it truly belongs here, unlike most of the Louvre's contents it was not plundered by Napoleon from around Europe! In the grounds you'll find more than adequate ice cream stalls and a large cafe but of course being a high culture venue, prices to match. However all the proceeds help to keep this wonderfulplace financially self-reliant."

The Mus\u00e9e Rodin is comprised of two parts \u2013 a two-story mansion housing the museum and 7.4 acres of gardens. It was raining very lightly as my wife and I meandered through the gardens of Mus\u00e9e Rodin, but the rain couldn\u2019t dampen our appreciation or admiration of the unbelievable number of sensational large bronze sculptures scattered throughout the entire garden. Every one of them is breathtaking. Being close enough to touch Rodin\u2019s creations of the large bronze sculptures known as \u201cThe Thinker,\u201d \u201cThe Three Shades,\u201d \u201cThe Gates of Hell,\u201d and \u201cThe Monument to the Burghers of Calais\u201d (just past the entrance in the front part of the garden) alone were worth the price of admission; everything else was a bonus. Near the back of the garden is a large pond in the middle of which is the famous large bronze sculpture of \u201cUgolino and His Children.\u201dThere are more amazing exhibits in the two-story mansion that houses the museum holding much of Rodin\u2019s work, including many Rodin\u2019s smaller bronze sculptures, marble sculptures, ceramics, drawings, prints, paintings, and photographs. Being able to admire Rodin\u2019s famous creations, including \u201cThe Kiss,\u201d \u201cFall of Illusion,\u201d \u201cThe Call of Arms,\u201d and the \u201cPedestal of the Titans,\u201d to name only a few, was a real treat. The museum also displays many ancient works of art that Rodin collected from Egypt, Greece, and Rome, and then later from the Far East.Auguste Rodin was an extremely prolific artist over his 77 years; the gardens and the museum beautifully display much of his work. A truly awe-inspiring experience."

It is not mobbed like the Louvre and you can really enjoy these wonderful pieces of art and sculpture without hundreds of people trying to take selfies with them. We also ate at the eatery in the museum which was lovely as well. I couldn't believe how close you could get to my favorite sculpture \"the kiss\""

We found the exhibits were informative but not compelling, and it can be very crowded inside too.The real treat and for us, the only reason for visiting, was strolling through the extensive walled sculpture gardens and enjoying the 25 works all beautifully presented. The gardens themselves are a welcome oasis in an otherwise non-stop city - and the bronze castings each capture so much depth it is hard to say anything other than \"awesome!\". I think even non-fans of Rodin would be impressed.Best to plan a couple hours or so and take your time. There's a garden side cafe to rest and have drinks or bites. The first Sunday of each month is free - and the combination ticket to the Musee d'Orsay (a must see) and the Musee Rodin is 18 euros. See the Musee d'Orsay web site. The Musee Rodin web site shows admission to the sculpture garden alone at just 5.30 euros."

Auguste Rodin (\u7f85\u4e39, Full Name: Francois Auguste Rene Rodin, 1840 - 1917) was a famous French sculptor. In 1916, Rodin donated his collections to the France Government, including sculptures and drawings, along with the reproduction rights. The Musee Rodin (\u7f85\u4e39\u7f8e\u8853\u9928) in Paris, France is a museum that opened 2 years after his death in 1919 and was dedicated to his works. We thought there was only one Musee Rodin in France at the Hotel Biron and its surrounding grounds in Paris. Later we learned there is another museum of Rodin just outside Paris at Rodin's old home, the Villa des Brillants at Meudon which Auguste Rodin bought on December 19, 1895. It was reopened on March 4, 2016. Rodin is considered as one of the most remarkable sculptors of his time. The collections include 6,600 sculptures, 8,000 drawings, 8,000 old photographs and 7,000 objet d'art (art object or work of art).We visited Rodin Museum in Philadelphia, PA, USA in 2012 and saw some of his famous sculptures. This time we had the chance to visit Musee Rodin in Paris. We took the metro line 12 to the Solferino station and walked to the museum. The walk took us 20+ minutes although it looked like only a short distance on the map. When we finally arrived at the gate, there was a security check and then we went to the building of museum (Hotel Biron). The major difference compared with the one we visited in Philadelphia was the quantities and varieties of the collections. Its displays include not only sculptures, but also numbers of marble, bronze, plaster, ceramics, paintings, drawings, and works by other artists (Monet, Renoir, Van Gogh) from his personal collections. You are allowed to take as many photos as you like without using flash. The major problem was the strong sunlight and the glass cabinets make it almost impossible to take a clear shot. Once we went through the indoor exhibitions, we went outside to the garden and found those famous sculptures like The Thinker, The Three Shades and The Gates of Hell. The pool in front of the museum is another lovely location to enjoy the museum (Hotel Biron).The closest metro station is Saint-Francois-Xavier (not the Varenne), and it takes you about 7 minutes to reach the museum. We found a wonderful feature of the museum - the open-air restaurant in the garden. You do not need to rush out for a meal but can sit on either side of the path with trees along the path. It was a lovely and unforgettable experience in addition to visiting the museum. Try to go there before noon so you can pick the table you like and enjoy it."

In fact poor lighting in all aspects is why this museum is so disappointing it should get a 5, but cannot because if what you miss due to horrible lighting throughout. The artwork is second to none. The location is fine. The presentation of sculptures with poor direct lighting, and some encased in glass, as well as pictures behind glass require delicate, but appropriate lighting. Compared to L'Orangerie museum this place's lighting is an injustice to the art work. The garden is beautiful and the totality of Rodin's work (as The Thinker is contemplating his work of Hell/Hades/Underworld) is magnificent - just all needs better lighting. Enjoy."

Those running this place not so much.Much of Rodin's work was designed to be shown together to produce a certain emotional response, like the elements of a fine meal. What these barbarians have done is separate them so that each item is seen in isolation.Would you eat a salad with the lettuce on one plate, the tomatoes on another and the chives hidden behind the salt?It's bad enough with Les Bourgeois de Calais, but to separate the components of The Gates of Hell is like dissecting a beautiful woman and asking us to appreciate her with her organs in glass jars.The final insult is that they took one of the elements of this masterpiece, Fallen Caryatid Carrying her Stone, was surrounded by plastic and unpainted plywood evidently in preparation where the directing tasteless could entertain other tasteless barbarians with bad wine and putrefying fingerfood while those who appreciate art could look on with horror."

A good portion of the museum is in the garden which was a truly wonderful experience. And there was much more inside the mansion than I had expected to see, so definitely buy tickets to see both.

The view of the museum from the end of the garden is postcard perfect. The entrance brings you to a building with the gift shop, bathrooms and some special exhibit (we didn't bother) but then you go outside to get into the museum proper. The Thinker is outside to right if facing the building and the Burgers of Calais and the Gates of Hell are on the left. These statutes are all outside and then you can go in the museum itself to wonder around the two floors and see Rodin's other lesser known work and see some other works by famous contemporaries that Rodin had acquired. Then wonder around the garden on the side and front/back of the museum and see even more statutes in a beautiful garden setting. There is a little cafe there outside along the right side serving the ubiquitous baguette sandwiches."

My overall assessment is that I would not go out of your way unless this is something specific you wanted to see while in Paris. I was certainly glad we stopped but then again I'm a bit \"art-snob\", unlike my hubby. Helpful hint: It's a feasible plan to split-up your party between Rodin and the Army Museum since they are literally right next to each other. This would have saved us a few euro on one entry fee into Rodin."

It contains not only many of his finished pieces but also hundreds of studies so you can view his developing thought processes, but also contains some of his personal art collection, including Picasso's. And then, there's the Garden!Scattered with many of Rodin's most famous pieces, it's a quiet sanctuary and the perfect place to rest your feet and gather your thoughts. I enjoyed this incredible museum far more than the Louvre. Go early. The museum pass covers admission. Enjoy!"

Outdoors, walk through various paths and get different angles and views of the various statues (don't miss the ones on the side in the back). Inside, you are lead through a number of rooms which contain statues, paintings, and collections of various interesting art pieces. The outdoor cafe is also nice and the ice cream was excellent there. The closest metro station is Varenne. While visiting this museum, also consider visiting the nearby Army Museum and Napolean's Tomb."

We arrived early and thought the placed was closed, so always check the front door sign and the website for opening. We went just across the street and had ouefs and cafe at the corner bar. Good! The Thinker is great to pose in front of, especially if you have a daughter who doesn't know what to do in life. :) The outside cafe was very inexpensive and delicious, so we coffee and then later lunch before we left for the next musee. The gardens contain Rodin's work along with information of when he sculpted them. Some writings of Rodin state that he made his students do most of the work and he took the credit for it; either way it was a piece of the French history transformed into art. If you have a Museum Pass the entrance is covered and the additional museum also. It was a great surprise inside to see a few Van Gogh's including the The Harvesters . Lots of sculptures from Rodin's early years. We both enjoyed it and was one of our favorite mornings."

The gardens of the Rodin Museum are an oasis of tranquility and powerful beauty in the midst of the city, while the sculpture garden and interior exhibition of the works of an artist called the heir to Michelangelo are not to be missed. From the iconic \"Thinker\", Adam, Eve, The Burghers of Calais and The Gates of Hell to the many busts and figures displaying a robust fascination with all things human, Rodin's works are a marvel of the marriage of materials and the imaginative, passionate mind."

I think the mus\u00e9e Rodin should be on any artlovers must see list for Paris.First of all the museum is situated in a beautiful building, the old h\u00f4tel Biron.Which used to be Rodin's workshop in Paris. he donated his entire art collection to the French State on the condition that they turn the buildings into a museum dedicated to his works.The exhibition is splitted in different rooms and exposes works starting from the beginning of his career until the very end. You'll also see all his most famous works like the thinker, the kiss, the gate of hell,... There are also paintings from Van Gogh and Renoir and Claudel that Rodin collected. I would recommend to use an audio guide if you want to get as much info as possible because in the museum itself are not so many info panels next to the artworks.After you've completed the visit in the hotel Biron, you can continue in the beautiful gardens and enjoy the sculptures there. Or even enjoy something to eat or drink in the caf\u00e9 in the gardens. One tip: come and visit the museum early so you can really enjoy the gardens and sculptures to yourself, as it can get a little loud, especially when groups are getting a tour in the museum later on in the day.Easiest way the get there is to take the metro line 13 and stop at the stop Varenne."

Plenty of benches to sit and admire the gardens and sculptures. It is very handicap friendly, both inside and out. There is a pleasant caf\u00e9 in the garden for pleasant eating and drinking.

Second, I was expecting this advertised garden to be more like a courtyard (since its in the heart of the city) not a very sizeable walled garden with A CAFE, trimmed hedges, nice landscaping and some important Rodin bronzes. Delightful! Not a lot blooming in April, so lucky you if you'll be there in late spring or summer.Allow maybe two hours if you take a break. Museum 10\u20ac each, includes the garden area although for a song you can buy a ticket for garden only, which would be one of the better hours of your life.In the cafe, we had large luncheon salads plus bread plus drink for about 15\u20ac each.NOTE: Do stop in the entry garden to pose for cheesey photos of yourself looking pensive next to the massive statue of The Thinker.

The gardens filled with wonderful sculptures are less crowded at this time of year especially midweek making for a more pleasant experience, but what ever the time of year it's worth visiting. Time to wander at leisure, contemplate like the \"thinker\" and soak it all up......brilliant. Inside the museum there's more sculptures than you can imagine but also some truly great works from the grand masters .....Monet, Renoir, and some stunning Van Gogh's compliment the exhibition."

One reviewer complained that there was only Rodin pieces - yes, it is the Rodin museum. There were a few pieces by Camille Claudel to spice up the drama. There was a short line up in March. I bought a combo ticket with the Musee d'Orsay and recommend asking for this if you are planning on visiting both. It saves a line up at the d'Orsay and there is a slight savings. I rented the audio guide but wish I didn't. I had lunch plans and when I asked how long it would take, was told 2 hr. Needless to say, I had hardly finished 3/4 of the house part of the museum by 2hr using the guide. The guide doesn't really tell you more than the excellent labels inside the museum but I do like Rodin. Sadly, the ticket does NOT allow you to re-enter. I therefore had to go back the next day and buy a garden only ticket. I thought this was rather poor on the museum's part but it is their policy.If you're not a big Rodin fan, I suppose you could just do the garden part but the information in the house does help you appreciate his process and his hardships. I would probably go back to this museum. But I recommend NOT to get the audio guide. That way you can go at your own pace and probably 2 but maybe closer to 3 hr would suffice."

For most of our \"excursions\" in Paris we hired a private guide but we did not have one for this visit. The Musee Rodin is small and didn't take a lot of time to get through for us. I'm sure some people could easily spend an entire day there though. There is a small indoor section and then the garden section. Most everything is in the garden section. The Gates of Hell, The Kiss, and The Thinker in my opinion were the highlights of the visit. There is a gift shop and a cafe that serves really good food. There was a line to get in to the museum-we arrived in the afternoon and the wait to get in was approximately 30-45 minutes."

You have seen a number of Rodin's sculptures in magazines and photos, but to see them up close and personal while looking at the in-depth features each one possesses is enlightening and special. The grounds are manicured and the museum itself is inside a former 18th century chateau. Several of the major sculptures are in the gardens outside and offer a great stroll through the grounds while observing the uniqueness. An easy museum to get through and an audio guide highlights Rodin, his works and his life."

Rodin applied 3 times to the Academy of Arts and was rejected by the conformist selection committee. Let's be thankful for that, because it forced him to find his own unique path to express himself. The inside of the museum shows his development as an artist, his ideas on what he wanted to become a museum, models of his work and many of the smaller miracles that he created, like Paolo and Francesca in the clouds, the dancers and a large version of the famous 'kiss'.Come on a sunny day and enjoy the gardens where large versions of his most famous work can be found: the gates of hell, the thinker and many many more. Although you can see everything in 45 minutes it is very well worth taking at least 3 hours to sit down on some of the many benches and just try to take it in, see how it speaks to you. There is a nice cafe in the garden that serves good coffee and a decent priced lunch, so one can even spend the whole day here.Probably my favorite museum on the planet."

The multiple versions of his works and their transformation from paper to plaster to marble or bronze address beautifully illustrated and presented at the museum. The artist was born playful and serious. He saw the world's the way that he saw it, and created out of that passion and emotion expressing love, passion, beauty. In the context of the home he lived in and the gardens that surround it though get a sense of his love for beauty and his own perspective of what that means.

The large Hotel de Borin where Rodin rented rooms has been carefully renovated and updated for the convenience of visitors/tourists and contains interesting exhibits from Rodin's working life as a sculptor and painter as well as paintings by his contemporaries, such as Monet and Van Gogh. However, even at this time of year it felt crowded and slightly cramped - perhaps too many exhibits for the space?"

During the summertime it's lovely sitting and reading on a bench in the garden while you can look at Rodin's statues, like \"The thinker\"... and it's really easy to fall asleep! Then there is still the museum with Rodin's work, it's not crowded at all and it doesn't take too long. If you have some time to spend, I suggest you to stop here!"

The museum, to its great credit, has included works by Camille Claudel, his mentally unstable pupil, who was so gifted that Rodin wasn't above claiming some of her work as his own. All your favourites are here: The Kiss, the Burghers of Calais, The Thinker, and loads of surprises too."

The renovation had more to do with fixing the physical structure than making a good museum. It is very crowded, they do not provide anywhere to sit, except on window sills, and the whole feeling inside is very stilted, even on a winter's day when there weren't that many people. I can't even imagine what it would be like in summer. There is also the severe problem of toilets: one in a basement, one on the second floor. The second floor has only one cubicle(!!) and endless numbers of women waiting to get in. Unfortunately, the day I was there the garden and cafe were closed because of a storm.There is no place inside the museum to eat or drink anything.Very poorly thought out, and it does a great disservice to Rodin's beautiful sculptures.They simply cannot be seen as well as they should be."

I'd spent the morning at the nearby Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e so thought I'd head here. Had to go through the now obligatory security, but this was more a check of what was in my rucksack than anything else. Buying a ticket was fairly easy too in the modern ticket hall - there are free maps to pick up there too as well as toilets and the usual gift shop.You can then head through the gardens to see an outdoor replica of The Thinker. Inside, you have to check your bag in (for free) and then head around the museum. I'm not a huge sculpture person but found it really interesting. The Kiss is about half way around, along with The Thinker (they're in the room straight in front of you as you walk in, but you can't get there until you walk around). The gardens are also worth a look around too and would be ideal if you wanted to eat a picnic in (or visit the cafe). Whether sculpture is your bag or not, this place is definitely worth a visit if you want a bit of peace and quiet in the city."

The setting is the hotel and gardens where Rodin worked for some of his time in Paris. The beautifully landscaped grounds set off the statues perfectly. I think you can bring a picnic, but if not, the cafe had some nice selections. My favorite sculptures were the Thinker, because of its position, and Eve, because, well, she's my favorite. You can examine the sculptures up close and see the detail. It's a different experience than you get in a museum."

The first statue we found after entering the garden was \"The Thinker\", one of the most celebrated sculptures ever known. Then, passing by the Museum Cafe we admired the \"Ugolino and his children\" statuary ensemble within the fountain opposite the museum building. After sit on a bench near the fountain to relax and enjoy the scenery we turned right and walked through the wooded area filled with statues until we reached \"The Gates of Hell\" and \"The Three Shades\". To tell you the truth I am not very fond of Rodin`s works but all in all we had a wonderful time there including the lunch at the Museum Cafe which was a great value for money."

Rodin is famous for his Thinker sculpture and it's right there as you enter the gate ! So many of his works are in the gardens, so after you visit inside take a walk to see even more work outside.. works such as the Burgers (?), and the Gates, and a large version of the 3 men embracing each other .. the Shadows, I think it's called ? Inside .. so many wonderful sculptures.. famous ones.. like \"The Kiss\", or the clasped hands (Cathedral).. all right there in front of you. There are hundreds of sculptures. He donated everything to the state.There are also some of his own things that he collected privately, like a Van Gogh, or a Monet that he swapped with the artist for a sculpture. There are also videos at the entrance which explain how he made the sculptures. A very enjoyable couple of hours. The museum itself is really beautiful, with a lovely garden. Obviously, as it was January, there weren't many flowers in bloom but there was a gardener there who was very busy pruning the roses ... hundreds of rose bushes ! We wanted to have a coffee in the caf\u00e9 in the garden, but as it was 12.00 noon, the manager said that we had to eat there, and we only wanted coffee/snack ! He lost out on about \u20ac60 there !"

I was in a bit of a hurry to see other sights so I didn't get a chance to see everything. I think it would take at least a day to see Rodin's own works, his art collection and the many works of his students. His statue, The Thinker, was the highlight of my experience there in light of it being something I've seen photos of ever since I was a little boy. I understand Rodin made many Thinkers which are placed at various museums around the world. I'm not sure if the statue I saw is the one owned by the City of Paris that was moved from the Pantheon to Hotel Biron in 1922. The Hotel Biron had transformed into Rodin museum."

I would love to return to see the actual museum, but the garden alone is worth the visit. It is peaceful and lovely and the sculptures are placed all around the premises. We sat at a table and had gelato and just enjoyed the surroundings. The Burghers of Calais was probably my favorite, next to the Thinker, and if you are not familiar with the story, check it out. The final bronzes are in Calais, but the workmanship is quite evident on the sculptures here. I hope to return one day to see the real museum."

A huge display of his work is there with lots of information on its history and even a short movie on its refurbishment upon the death of Rodin. I must say however that there are other artists who I believe are better than Rodin and can be seen in various museums around Paris. He was brilliant at the human form but did not tend to \"finish\" his sculpture but left the areas around the forms in their natural state. There are also a few wonderful impressionist paintings from his own personal collection on display. He was also a very astute business man as this is the only completely self funded museum in Paris.You can purchase the Paris Museum Pass here as well which is worth every cent if you plan on going to many. The Paris Pass which is different is very pricey and in my opinion not worth the expense."

The house on site has several exhibits which are very good, but what I think the real highlight is are the gardens and large sculptures outside. The garden is beautiful on its own. I'm sure it looks glorious on a sunny, summer day, but I was there on a cold and rainy winter day and it was still an experience I'd never trade.

Rodin's works remain as impressive as ever. But I prefer his finished creations to the myriad plaster works that have been added to rooms. And though one of the renovation goals was to focus on lighting, I found that the light play on some display cases prevents a clear view of the contents.The garden beckons to me more than the museum itself, which was also true in the past. Rodin's sculptures here, such as The Thinker, The Burghers of Calais and the Gates of Hell are simply stunning. I find it pleasant to walk around the beautifully landscaped grounds and come across one sculpture after another. In warm weather, many chairs beckon to come and sit for a while.

Although many visitors mainly come here to see the famous 'The Thinker' statue set grandly in the centre of a maze in the garden as the epitome of Rodin's work plus 'The Kiss' marble sculpture displayed inside one of the buildings, there are many other sculptures which are quite interesting too. In fact, apart from tourists you can also find locals or art students spending the time drawing the lesser known sculptures hidden in the shades.There is also a little cafe where you can buy snacks and ice cream and was a welcome respite for me as my legs were aching from walking from the louvre museum and getting a bit lost in the side streets before I finally found this museum. (Nonetheless, I serendipitously found two other delightful neighbourhood gardens in the side streets so it wasn't a total loss.) I'm not sure what was in another building as I didn't venture there because of some renovation works in the area around it. I think you pay less if you just want to walk around the garden and not go inside the buildings to see his exhibition work but for first time visitors - his exhibition is worth a visit as there are many sculptures made from marble. Also if you want to see 'The Kiss' sculpture, its inside."

For that reason alone, there's really no way I can give it less than 4/5, though in realty the artwork, layout and information is worth 5/5 while management of the queues, security and tills is worth a 1-2/5.We arrived on Dec 29 (Tuesday) around noon to find the queue almost 2 blocks long. It seemed to be moving so we guesstimated a 30-40min wait. The first problem was that of the two large gates you pass to enter the property, one was shut. Since most people were in groups of 3-4 people they took up most of the space at this gate. So when people with Paris Museum passes or pre-purchased tickets arrived they had to squeeze through all the people since there was no dedicated line for them. Not only that but many people with pre-purchased tickets didn't know that they could jump the queue since their dedicated entrance is only marked once past security. Only once in our hour long wait did someone go out onto the street and shout out \"Museum pass?\" Lots of confusion on that front.Because there is no dedicated line to funnel pass holders toward the security check, you could make it all the way to the front of the line (for security checks, we of course understand their importance) and find yourself with 10 people clamouring to get in front of you. One more security guard, or a dedicated queue wherein the one guard could check 5 from one line and then 5 from the other would not go amiss. Like a Disney World Fast Pass - you've jumped *most* of the queue already, you can wait for 5-10 people to have their security check, you'll get to pass them once past security anyway!Then there's two dedicated lines once past security except the pre-purchase line (to the right) involves those people walking directly in front of the registers and those waiting to buy tickets even though they don't need a ticket so you think you're at the front, they think they're at front and the reality is that they can walk on by but there's virtually no direction. Why the queues are the other way around makes no sense.All of this really put a damper on our visit. A lot of people around us looked frustrated and annoyed as well; while those with pre-purchased tickets looked sheepish and embarrassed as they \"queue jumped\" even though it's entirely their right! All that was needed was another formed queue and the second gate door opened. My step-mom commented several times on the Musee Rodin being an efficiency experts nightmare.Only two registers keeps the queue moving super slow as well. Unless that's the point? Washrooms in the main entrance have multiple stalls; inside the mansion the men's was out of service and the women's had one stall.Once finally inside we found ourselves in an amazing re-worked exhibit. Rodin sculptures are nothing short of spectacular and his personal donations has created such a wonderful museum. Seeing all of his practice pieces just goes to show that brilliant artists still need to work on their craft, something generally omitted. The gardens are lovely and laid out beautifully. I will certainly come back, but either with a pre-purchased ticket and my head kept down or as early in the day as possible."

The exhibits in the house are arranged very thoughtfully, allowing one to see the progression of Rodin's work. The audio guide provides short, informative narrations on the key objects, without overwhelming one with detail.Visiting in December meant that we avoided the crowds. Most of the other visitors seemed to be Parisians, with a number of young families taking advantage of the Christmas holidays. The day of our visit was unusually warm, so walking round the lovely gardens was even more of a delight. We were even able to enjoy a good lunch at the cafe sitting outside.It is worth combining a visit here with a trip to Les Invalides, which is clearly visible from the museum and less than 10 minutes' walk away."

There is all of his greatest achievements \"the kiss\" etc and a good number of lesser known sculptures and sketches. I've visited this museum many times and it never lets me down. On one occasion I watched the famous \"gates of hell\" sculpture (a giant bronze door covered in naked writhing sinners burning in hell) being cleaned.

Four hours at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay and you have seen maybe half of the salons; four full days in the Louvre and you may have visited a quarter of their offerings. Rodin's life is art in many forms and this small museum is dedicated to exposing his life and his art. Though bursting with great works, two hours will give full pleasure.The directrice and staff have done an excellent job with the catalog and presentation, both interior and exterior [in the gardens]. I was amazed to find that Rodin had amassed such a fine collection of art from other artist. His gallery of paintings is an extra bonus.Take the time to watch the videos in the little space under the staircase and the videos cycling on two screens in the first salon. Also use the audio guide. They are chalked full of information and have additional information segments you can access by just hitting the PLAY button a second time."

I loved the little tea house there for us all to rest & have refreshments. Of course, the genious of Rodin was not lost in this exposure as evidenced in their daily journals that the children kept. One granddaughter,13 years, gave a presentation to her class this fall of all the wonderful exposure to various artists & museums that she had visited while in Paris.

Set in the mansion where Rodin used to live, Musee Rodin organizes his artwork in chronological order to describe his progression. This is definitely a must-go destination for all Rodin fans or generally people who are enthusiastic about sculptures!Musee Rodin has two main parts: a two-story interior exhibit and a garden exhibit, both has a sizable collection of his or his students' sculptures. Unlike most museums, Musee Rodin is actually better as a sunny day activity so you can walk through the beautiful garden and admire the interior exhibit in natural lighting. If you do not intend to hear the details, you can easily finish in an hour, but I highly recommend buying an audio guide to get the most out of this museum! Unless you are already knowledgeable on the matter, the audio guide truly helps in understanding the significance of each Rodin piece and its role in building up his famous style. I was a Rodin fan before I came in, and after spending two hours in there, I have even greater respect for this remarkable artist!Take an hour or two under a good weather to admire this beautiful museum! It's a shame that Paris doesn't advertise this as much as the Louvre or d'Orsay, but that simply means that the crowd is much smaller. Especially if you intend to get an audio guide, Musee Rodin is definitely an excellent museum to visit!---tl;dr version:1) Set in a mansion where Rodin used to live2) Good for a sunny day activity because of the garden3) Get an audio guide to get the most out of this museum!"

This museum has both an indoor and outdoor component with the outdoor component being the more interesting of the two. if the weather is bad, I think you are better off waiting for the weather to improve so you can see the outside portion as well. I would probably rate this museum as less essential to your Paris adventure than Orsay or Louvre but probably the best museum to go to after those two larger ones and definitely any 5-6 trip or longer you should strongly consider going to Rodin museum."

When you walk out of the entrance facility you have 'The Thinker' on your right and the 'Gates of Heaven and Hell' and 'The Burgers' on your left. These masterpieces alone are worth the visit, and you get to see them both on entering and leaving. The chateau contains many of his plaster models and presents how he performed his art. The art is in the gardens, and visitors should stroll the entire estate since scuptures are dispersed throughout. My only disappointment was to find that 'La Defense' had been moved to the Rodin House in Meudon. Plan a leisurely couple of hours and take your time to enjoy the grounds."

In addition to plaster casts and bronzes, his paintings are here as well as paintings he owned by other artists, including Van Gogh. Rodin's paintings were quite beautiful -- he did landscapes in addition to the studies I expected to see. He sometimes did several castings of sculptures, including The Thinker, presented in an outdoor garden setting. There were two walls that featured studies he'd done: one wall of hands, another wall of feet, ankles, and legs. In addition to Rodin's work, there are works by his student Camille Claudel. In fact, one of her works was actually my favorite of the exhibit; specifically The Waltz, which had remarkable fluidity and movement. There is a little cafe on the property that serves above-average fare for this type of setting (at least in the US it's above-average. In France, it's just about what you'd expect.) Highly recommended if you enjoy art, particularly sculpture."

Some of the heads and hands are the finest bronzes ever made by anyone, ever.

Most of the items on exhibit are not the bronze works that can be found in the world's great museums, but plaster works that were models for those great works. The museum is in an old two story villa with a large garden in back. I was fascinated by the story of how Rodin decided to bequeath all of his works to the State, and also how he chose the Hotel Biron as his home away from home, where he would meet people during the last decade of his life.The Mus\u00e9e Rodin just reopened on 12 November 2015, so it's very popular.

We were \"forced\" outside and thus saw more of the statues in the garden than I saw when I was last there (and the gallery was open). While we were enjoying the gardens, we saw a group of blind patrons experiencing the statues which was fascinating, and also saw the fashion week stands being set up."

The museum is housed in a building known as the H\u00f4tel Biron. The gardens that also display a number of his works are lovely at any time of year. You can see, in a natural setting, The Thinker, the Gates of Hell and The Kiss. Rodin really understood depth and passion, which shows in his sculptures that really embody different human emotions and experiences like love, conflict and dispair. His understanding of the human body is shown clearly in the poses and defined musculature of his sculptures. It's a serene experience. Peaceful if your alone, romantic with a partner. This museum outshines the Louvre experience with regards to connecting with work and the artist. It's really not to be missed, and is a pleasant walk from the Eiffel tower if you're in the area. There are also works by his lover, Camille Claudel and other pieces of art from his personal collection. You can also see his drawings. Enjoy!"

The main house is beautifully arranged and very informative in showing how the casting process is done and sculptures are created.

On a sunny worm day it is a delightful experience.Auguste Rodin, considered to be one of the greatest 19th century French sculptors moved in on the first floor of Hotel Biron, now a museum. He made it his studio in 1908. Eventually he occupied the whole building until his death in 1917. In lieu of rent he donated his entire collection and possessions to the nation, in which manner he saved the building from being demolished.The well kept the park displays many if his well known sculptures including the famous Thinker, set in the portion of formal garden. The leisurely walk will take one by many of his sculptures. The Gates Of Hell Door on the left, the Burgers of Calais,, Balzac and many more.The garden has natural ares and thousands of roses. Eiffel twerp and skyline of Paris can be seen from the garden"

While this exhibition requires fairly lesser time to tour around (and why of course, for it houses the works of Rodin exclusively), the attention to detail to each of his works is enough to capture one's eye and root them to the spot, lest they miss any of the finer details. Audioguides are available at the front counter for those who wish to understand the pieces' details. These are made available in English, French, Italian, Spanish and Korean at 5 Euros per piece.The inner part of the Museum consists of only parts of his works; the life-sized sets are displayed for consideration in the gardens. This allows one to walk around the sculptures freely in open air. His famous works, 'The Thinker' and 'The Gates of Hell' are also found here. For a novice (as me) who barely understands arts, one of the interesting features of Rodin's works is the expression he has captured on each of his faces. They vary from displaying shock, depression, sadness to awe, inspiration and admiration. Some even showcase indifference.Although sadly, The h\u00f4tel Biron was closed for refurbishment while we visited, we would certainly want to go back for a second look."

The garden area feels so secluded and doesn't seem like it is just the other side of the hedge from a busy street (it is across a side street from the left side of Les Invalides as you face Les Invalides). There is a little snack shop inside the edge of the gardens (on the street side of the gardens) with various salads, sandwiches, beverages, and treats.Tips: there was a line up the sidewalk from the entrance, but if you have a Paris Museum Pass, go to the front of the line and they will let you right in! You can wander the museum and then go out the back door of the museum into the first part of the gardens. But continue down the hedge path and you'll find the much larger garden area beyond.To exit back to the street, you will have to re-enter through the back door of the museum and go out the front/main entrance.They were still doing construction on the large house when we were there, so I cannot comment on the house other than it looks beautiful from the outside!As with all museums in Paris, check their hours and days of closure before you head there, so you aren't disappointed to find it closed."

The details, artistry, and realism in these sculptures (large or small) are just beyond belief. Of course you have to go there to see the famous \"Thinker\" sculpture in the garden. Unfortunately, the museum was under renovation and remodeling when we were there in September 2015, so we spent less than two hours over there, but we still enjoyed it a lot. If you are a fan of sculptures, this is the place to visit in addition to Louvre. Go, think, and enjoy the place!"

It is very well balanced and peaceful and, again, many explanations in both French and English. I thoroughly enjoyed this visit viewing the magnificent works of art of this fascinating sculptor. The tea rooms have a small but varied selection of drinks and snacks all amid the gardens.

Unfortunately the main house/museum is being renovated so the indoor exhibition was in a newer building and was just okay. Really enjoyed the bronze sculptures outside though. Definitely recommend it."

When the building then became the Hotel it was first populated by artists (some of note, including Rodin) and then it was taken over by Rodin and finally became the Musee Rodin around 1916 when the Assembly accepted his art works, permitted him to occupy the premises for his lifetime and proclaimed it as the museum. Go see masterpieces such as the thinker, the Burghers of Calais and The Gates of Hell (at least 10 years in the making). You will find this more than worthwhile."

Whilst the main block is closed for renovations, the entrance/visitor centre contains a really well presented and fascinating exhibition relating to the background to some of Rodin's masterpieces, examples of which are then presented in the exquisite gardens. The narrative is excellent, and in both French and English. The mixture of photos (some annotated), sketches, early models etc really bring alive Rodin's creativity and way of working. Pieces which are now accepted as masterpieces are seen in their historical context, sometimes rejected by their commissioning bodies. The sheer effort in moving from idea to finished product is evident from the exhibits, as is the way in which Rodin sought to portray each subject. We will return in the hope that the same care is given to interpreting the contents following the renovation - opening in November 2015. "

The first day was closed and next day there were some works for some months and only a temporary exhibition was available.I would suggest to the responsible to do the following next time:1. Better explain on their website both what can be visit during the works and which days the museum is closed (so that you don't have to go and check for that).2. Work on a room while the rest of the museum is open, then close another one and keep the others open and so on, so the visitor can still enjoy most of the exhibition."

Unfortunately, the main exhibit was closed today, August, 26, 2015, due to renovations so they offered us tickets to the Garden and we took them for a total of 2 Euros. We walked through to the back and saw the big one - The Thinker. One of the most famous sculptures in the world. We actually thought that was it for 2 Euros until we walked toward the toilettes and saw a HUGE garden in the back.There are lots of twists and turns where you'll find hidden sculptures. The flowers and landscaping are beautiful. There are plenty of places to sit and just look at these beautiful pieces. I only gave it a 4 because we couldn't get inside to see the rest of it.Really pretty garden, though."

Don't miss the walk around the fence where they have posted the history of the hotel and how Rodin and his friends got together there. That was almost more interesting than the exhibit inside!"

Rodin's version of Ugalino, the alleged cannibal count from Dante's Inferno, is at center of back fountain and a remarkable depiction of despair.

They are the most spectacular part of the museum, and wandering around looking at the sculpture and art outside is even better than the inside. The large bronze casting of The Thinker, the Gates of Hell, and his family casting of Balzac all reign in their areas of the garden.Do avoid using the rest rooms here, however, as even walking by them will cause your eyes to water with the terrible smell.

It is am extremely enjoyable setting in which to view Rodin's work.The Hotel Biron and parts of the gardens are currently undergoing refurbishment, but there is an excellent temporary display and many more sculptures have been temporarily housed in the gardens.

The docents are unobtrusive and there is plenty of information available for non-Francophones. I loved being able to have my lunch in the garden with the sculptures of my choice."

We had a lovely afternoon in the garden, we had lunch at the cafe and enjoyed the shade on a hot day.It was very nice to get some respite from the heavy crowds around as this wonderful place must be just off the beaten track for most tourists and was not very busy.The temporary exhibit was a little disappointing but they do have the Kiss on display. Note to families- no strollers allowed in the temporary exhibit. They can be left outside the door. We had our 1 year old napping in the stroller so my husband and I went one at a time."

We went in July 2015 and pretty much the entire museum was under construction. The gardens-- which are breathtaking-- are open though, and so we paid 7 euros and learned all we could do was walk through it. But again, because so much is under construction you are literally walking amongst orange tape. Don't get me wrong, this museum is amazing and absolutely worth seeing, but save your trip for when the work is done."

Currently the main house is being renovated. To compensate, there is an excellent exhibit showing, through plaster and clay models as well as beautiful photographs, how Rodin created many of his wonderful works. Start here, then go to the gardens and see the finished works cast in bronze or carved in marble. You can pay a separate admission to just enjoy the gardens, sit in the shade, contemplate \"The Thinker\" or \"The Gates of Hell\" then perhaps repair to the little caf\u00e9 (prices okay for a museum eatery) for a small bit and a drink. Even on a first visit to Paris, I highly recommend squeezing in an hour or two to at least enjoy the gardens."

It is housed in a former convent structure that was closed by the government around 1900 and was used by artists as a place to stay afterward. It was basically adopted by Rodin as his home.The large house is under renovation, but there are many Rodin works in the garden, including the Gates of Hell and The Thinker. There is also a very good cafe and you can eat in the garden \u2013 where else can you have lunch surrounded by Rodin sculpture?The museum was free the day we visited, perhaps due to the renovation, but it is also included in the excellent museum pass you can buy at art museums all over the city.If you really need a Rodin fix, there is also a large Rodin museum in Philadelphia, about a 5 minute walk to the Philadelphia Museum of Art.Even with the closure, this is a good place to visit, and an ideal place for lunch if you are nearby.

We visited on a sunny day, and having been to perhaps a dozen galleries in the space of a week, this was a wonderful change of pace. The collection featured some favourites of mine, including Burghers of Calais and the Gates of Hell. This is a great gallery to take kids to, as the outdoor space is more welcoming than indoor galleries."

We returned this month and it wasn't as great an experience. The house portion was closed for renovations, and the few exhibits shown in the visitor center building were not as enjoyable to browse as the main collection in the house. The gardens are worth a visit, to see the Thinker as well as the unfinished gates and the Burghers of Calais. Hopefully once the renovations are done the experience will be even better, but as it is now we only stayed about half an hour and were sorry we couldn't see the house. Note that it is part of the Museum Pass, and fairly near the Army Museum, so it is worth a stop if you're nearby and have the pass to enable free entry."

I am an avid fan of Rodin, and proud owner of a bronze reproduction of \"Cathedral\" (purchased before bronzes became unaffordable) so I had looked forward to visiting one of two French landmarks dedicated to Rodin: Musee Rodin and le Maison Rodin. The Musee Rodin is in Paris and therefore more accessible, so it was an easy choice.The Musee Rodin was formerly a hotel that Rodin stayed in whenever he was in Paris. It prides itself on being the only museum that is wholly privately funded. All the sculpture is in the garden. The hotel building itself is closed off. It was not clear to me whether it is open to the public under normal conditions.Perhaps bcause of its private finding and the renovation, the museum did not seem to be as organised as all the others we visited in Paris (Louvre, D'Orsay, Museum of Modern Art, Cluny, L'Orangerie, etc). Some areas were closed off. I did not see a replica of \"The KissThe other Parisian museums do not have much of Rodin's work. The only other museum that displays a lot of Rodin's work which I have visited is Stanford University's Cantor Arts Center. I enjoyed my visit and think it was worth it."

Rodin has been my favorite French artist since I was 15 when I stood in front of the Marble Porte de l'enfer at the Musee D'Orsay for the first time. This museum does not disappoint in it's outdoor collection of sculptures displayed among the gardens of tall trees and beautiful flowers. Inside there is an educational gallery of Rodin's process as an artist which reminded me of the basement museum at La Sagrada Famiglia in Barcelona in that it showed models, test versions and different medias that Rodin used to create the final product and in many cases the different versions of his final product. This is a very easy and accessible museum for Paris. I recommend it to art lovers but also as an introduction to art because there are recognizable works but also educational and engineering aspects that will interest many. Entry is free on Sundays. The Kiss is much more moving in person than in pictures."

It was very interesting to see \"The Thinker\" in person and the grounds were very well maintained. There was a lot for us to see and do, including a large variety of sculptures and artistic pieces. Very glad we took an afternoon to discover all that the museum had to offer. Would definitely recommend people to go and see for themselves."

Althoug castings of many of Rodin's sculptures can be seen around the world, the depth and breadth of the collection at the Musee Rodin in Paris is not to be missed.

I don\u2019t begrudge the museum\u2019s need to bring things up to date as far as security, etc., goes, but the exhibit on the Laboratory of Creation may be better suited to art historians and Rodin specialists.Four stars for the museum under construction, five stars for the museum when it's in the Hotel Biron."

The whole point is to see the sculptures in the context of his home to understand how he lived and worked, so I don't understand why they didn't shut down entirely for the renovations.Even the gardens are filled with construction equipment. We were able to see The Thinker and The Gates of Hell, which are outside in the gardens, but there was a lot of construction equipment and noise.

We got in the queue for entry and were greeted by a very bored and surly clerk who clearly did not want to be where she was. Once past this bear, we enjoyed a lovely walk through the gardens. Most of Rodin's work is wonderful, but some of it is pretty black given his fixation with Dante's Hell and it's nine hideous rings. Even, so the dark bronzes were quite fascinating to see. Our lunch in the garden cafe was simply divine, and seemed to us what a Parisian lunch should be! We thoroughly enjoyed the experience here."

The gates of hell are absolutely fascinating, if you walk around the garden you will see miniature replica us in the gate of larger statues that are in the garden. One of the main reasons I always go to my dad is I love Victor Hugo and were dancing to be fascinated by Hugo as there are many sculptures of him. We were there in May 2015 and then main museum is closed however all the grounds are accessible for two euros a great deal ,for a little while anyways ."

Quietly located in a plush garden, the Rodin museum is dedicated to just to work of one artist - a nice change from the thousands and thousands of varied work in the Louvre for example. His sculptures are vivid and fluid, and the garden is relaxing. You can see the whole exhibit in 25 minutes, or spend an hour by fountain and take it all in. Note: it's very close to the Armory and Napoleon's Tomb, so try and do it all together. Gift shop's a little expensive. Overall a must if you have the Paris Pass."

As others have said, there's ongoing construction so check before to see whats accessible and what's off limits. Wasnt too bad for us, but could definitly ruin your visit if Theyve shut down half the site. If your a Rodin fan, or a lover of sculpture, then definitely don't miss it.

Of course the sculpture was wonderful, but I found the rose gardens, while not as large as Portland's, were an equally beautiful part of the experience. It didn't hurt that we were there on a warm day with blue skies - rainy weather might have made this a different experience as so much of the museum is outdoors in a beautiful park setting."

You buy your ticket and then you have to hand it another person sitting a meter away who \"checks it\" and takes it off you. Totally inept process!

A ticket in costs only \u00a32, and there are plenty of Rodins magnificent sculptures places round the park. The park is really nice and relaxed. Perfect spot to just wander around, sit and relax on the benches, or have a snack at the restaurant."

Through Rodin\u2019s collection of paintings and sculptures of other artists, and his own sketches and drawings, one can understand more about the work of this genius. His work alone is very much worth visiting whereas the garden is truly an extra bonus. The layout of this little charming garden is very well thought out. Together with the beautiful flowers as the background, the big outdoor sculptures help surpass the art appreciation experience."

There are little plaques at each sculpture to give a short explanation of each and make sure you pick up a map so you know where things are located. It's not a large area, so you won't get lost, but just in case you are looking for a specific sculpture, such as The Thinker. There is a cafe in the garden, the gelato was very good and refreshing in the heat. Pack a lunch and sit on a bench enjoying the garden.The only thing that made me rate it a 4/5 is that a group of high school students arrived and ruined the ambience.

Nevertheless:Because I've always enjoyed sculpture; I naturally assumed that I liked Auguste Ronin's work.It turns out I was only partially correct. My visit to Musee Rodin exposed Ronin's feet of clay. And they were pretty big feet at that. Much of what I've seen to date of the man's work has demonstrated power and emotion; much of what I discovered at his home and gardens in Paris was the dark side. His statue of Victor Hugo being inspired by a tortured muse is excellent and inspirational; his gates of Hell is somewhat of a mixed bag with seemingly inappropriate figures; but some of the lesser works on display in his garden display an awkward, almost clumsy aspect to his execution. This was one occasion when I wished I hadn't visited an exhibit.But, don't let me stop you; the experience is yours to discover."

Be sure to allow time to simply sit in the gardens, and enjoy the sculptures where they were meant to be.I did find everything to be handicapped accessible, and had no trouble with my walker. Most of the pathways are a firm enough, and small enough, gravel, or are firm dirt or pavement, so navigation was easy. At one point we did have to do stairs with no rail, but we could have backtracked around the house if necessary to avoid that.There is a handicapped accessible toilet at the back of the gift shop.You may have to walk half a block or so to find a taxi upon leaving."

During the last trip (April 2015) the mansion was closed for renovation and thus really the only things to see were the statues in the garden. (There was a small indoor exhibition too, but nothing compared to what one would see in the Manor House.) The statues in the garden included some of Rodin's most famous works and they are breathtaking but not being able to see all the works in the mansion really detracted from the experience. It's a tough call for the first time visitor, but if you've been there before and only have a limited time in Paris I would probably not go there. Once the mansion opens again, I am sure it will be on the \"Do Not Miss\" list."

The mood and atmosphere would have been different had it been rainy or cloudy. The mansion and main museum are closed until Sept 2015 for renovations so I would not even bother with the temporary exhibit, and just go for the gardens where Rodin's famous sculptures are.We have a 7 year old so he had a blast running around the garden. We spent a good 1.5 hours on such a lovely and warm spring day in April. This is very good for kids. I don't know if we would feel the same way if the weather was 80 degrees F, where it might feel sweltering and tire one out, but when we went it was good in the 70s. This place would be a once in a lifetime deal, but the flowers were not all in full bloom so my opinion might be different if I had come in May."

He wasn\u2019t the first to shun sculpting heroic decorative monuments, or to master the anatomy. His genius is in molding his bronze casts to express the overwhelming emotions of terror, love, dejection and loss. His figures, barely a shade less than funeral black, set a depressing tone for the museum\u2019s gravel paths, lawns and alleys of tightly pruned chestnut groves.

Entrance was 2\u20ac per person (full rate).As soon as you enter the gardens, you'll find a path leading to the right, taking you to 'The Thinker' and to your left, you'll find 'The Gates of Hell'. We chose to head towards the right and spent an hour looking at different sculptures and walking/sitting around. There are plenty of sign boards in English and French which provide an introductory biography of Rodin and information on some of his works. The area in front of 'The Gates of Hell' is magical, with lovely sculptures and greenery. The gardens must be absolutely beautiful in Spring and Autumn.Highly recommend a visit here which is easily accessible after seeing the Eiffel Tower or the nearby 'Les Invalides', on foot."

Able to see the thinker sculpture, but that was about it. Apparently the garden was closed as it was windy (well it was a little windy, but not very), and the museum is being renovated so no access. Despite this we were charged the full admission rate. I am sure this would be a lovely place to come if you could actually see it, but we couldn't!. Poor showOn the plus side the toilets were clean!"

Rodin's larger sculptures are beautifully placed in the extensive gardens of L'Hotel Biron. Le Penseur (The Thinker) is most likely the first sculpture you will see. I was actually enthralled with it! I wished I could sketch so I could sit there with the art students and just stare it all day! I arrange my tour through the gardens in a counterclockwise manner so I end up at the Gates of Hell. If it doesn't remind you of Dante's Inferno...it should. Rodin was inspired by Dante'. As with everything in Paris, I suggest reading up a bit before you get there. It really makes the experience more enjoyable. The Paris Pass gets you in FREE. "

Blessed be the French for their discounts: because I had my EU card with me, and was under 25, I actually had free admission to the museum's garden. My mother had to pay some 2.50\u20ac - 3.00\u20ac admission to enter the garden.The garden is stunning, on a sunny day it's just magnificent with sunrays peaking through the canopy of trees and highlighting each statue and sculpture perfectly, giving them a new life. The Gates of Hell are just otherworldly, they took my breath away... There is a magnificence to Rodin's work, to the pained expressions that although haunting are just so beautiful...The garden also has several places in which to sit down and relax, perfect for a peaceful lunch. Not to mention that from the garden you have perfect views of the Golden Dome of the Hotel des Invalides, which is just across the street, and if you squint you can even see the tip of the Eiffel Tower.Even though we only saw the garden I still hold it as the best museum experience we had in Paris, I absolutely loved it."

But My wife had her heart set on going.Honestly say I was pleasantly surprised - As a Non Arty person I thought it was going to be a long couple of hours .... Anything but it's well structured and more than just sculptures - There was a great deal on the history behind the pieces as well as the journey etc. A great deal about the Artist as well and his life etc.At the time the we visited there was a temporary exhibition (So maybe I only sat the best bits) not sure if this was reflected in the low entry price .... I'll go back again when next in Paris and the Exhibition is fully open again"

But do not put it off forever. The garden is HUGE. We went here early on a European vacation and it was interesting to see how many of his sculptures were in other cities we visited. As others have said, the main museum is under renovation. However a fair number of works have been moved and can be viewed in the reception building.

It's so fun to stroll through the grounds contemplating his works and mimicking some poses for photos. Without believing one knows much about Rodin's work, one actually knows more than one thinks. The Kiss, The Thinker (anyone remember Dobie Gillis) The Burghers of Calais, The Gates of Hell.... His works departed from mainstream of his time and pushed the bounds to think of sculpture in other ways. What I love about his story is that he tried numerous times to get into the foremost art school in France but failed to get in - an example of . Kind of the artistic version of Howard Roark in The Fountainhead. There's a reason he is one of the most celebrated sculptors in the world which makes it all the more reason to visit this vast collection of his works. A lovely way to spend even a somewhat drab day - despite us visiting on an overcast, somewhat cold day in November, we had a really uplifting, pleasant and memorable time. There are few truly great open air sculpture gardens (Hakone in Japan!), this one is small but convenient, and easily and quickly visited. 1.5 hours of your morning will be very well spent. Entry was Euro 6/pp. Oh, and there's actually some footage of Rodin on a youtube video."

It's not too big so it won't take long to see the whole thing - probably 1.5 hrs at most, so if you have a short time in Paris but want to see some art, the Rodin is a great choice.There is a beautiful outside garden where you can see the famous Thinker in all it's glory, and then be even more blown away by the masterpiece that is the Gates of Hell. There are many famous pieces there, but those two are on the top of the list. Plenty of opportunities to take photos.There is a small discount for students as well. The line wasn't too long when we arrived at the museum at around 10:30 a.m., maybe a half hour wait at most, but I recommend getting there early to avoid it getting any longer. That way you can do a cute brunch somewhere else and continue along your sightseeing of Paris. There's an inside part of the museum as well, which houses lesser well known sculptures, some casts, and some paintings.My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. He has very little interest in going to museums and seeing art, and he had a great time! I chose it specifically because I knew it was much easier to tackle than the Musee D'Orsay and the Louvre (which is unbelievably overwhelming)."

The sculptures are crowded together in no special order nor is there any dramatic lighting to make Rodin's work more dramatic. But you are not there to be impressed by settings, you are there to see the genius of this master sculptor. As you view each piece the placement and setting becomes less annoying and you become completely engrossed in each piece. The Museum is within walking distance of Les Invalides so you can Do both in one day."

The outdoor space was our personal favorite - it was very quiet and peaceful, the roses were in bloom and there were a couple of rabbits scampering about the grounds. Some statues are staged thoughtfully among the gardens and it just makes for a wonderful stroll. I'd recommend getting there first thing in the morning, as I did notice when we were leaving, there was quite a line and it was not nearly as quiet as when we arrived.

While this was originally not on my must see list, we were in the area and it was probably going to be a once in a lifetime opportunity. The Thinker was displayed on a pedestal outside in a garden. It was so cool to see the famous statue up close, and there were virtually no crowds so it was a joy to get close and take lots of photos. While reading some of the materials at the museum I learned that the statue was supposed to be in the image of Dante. I also saw another beautiful work titled the \"Gates of Hell\" that is supposed to represent the entrance to the 'underworld'. After learning about the Dante I was able to follow the theme from Dante's Inferno. If I had done a bit of research before I visited the museum I am sure I would have enjoyed it more but it was still a great visit - even for someone that is not an art enthusiast!"

Highlights are the \"The Thinker\", \"The Gates of Hell\" and \"The Kiss\".

The Rodin Museum was opened in 1919 and is housed in The Villa des Brilliant, a mansion from the 18th C. where the famous sculptor lived from 1895-1917. The collection includes 6.600 sculptures, 8000 drawings, 8000 old photographs and 7000 art objects and it draws 700.000 visitors p/year. Many of Rodin's sculptures are displayed in a natural setting in the government restored rose gardens including his three world famous creations: his first major public commission, The Burghers of Calais, his single best known work, The Thinker, on Rodin's tomb, and, not completed when he died, The Gates of Hell. Inside one can marvel over The Kiss, the Nude of Balzac, the Monument to Balzac( also in the garden), the Prodigal Son, The Crouching Woman ,The Age of Bronze and even a few paintings from Van Gogh and Renoir. All his works, with some initially labeled obscene, were donated to the government in return for turning the place into a museum dedicated to his works. There 's also another site at his former workshop at Hotel Biron."

It's a different pace than the other museums where people crowd you and bump you to get a look at a piece of art. In this museum you can sit for hours in front of great statutes. The thinker is the most visited pice of art, but you should definitely spend some time on the Gate to Hell...that was my favourite.

It's fresh every time you go. Because of the current rebuilding works, the first third of the museum has been turned into an exhibition of his work in progress, illustrated by photos of his studio etc., which is genuinely interesting. The gardens are spectacular. Rodin's greatest works are displayed where they look best, in the open air, with the wonderful backdrop of the old chateau-like Hotel Biron behind and the great monuments of Paris visible on the horizon. The effect of the garden is quite different in winter, when the trees are bare, from the summer, when the trees are in full leaf and the light is totally different. I always leave the museum itself until last. If you have any affection for art, or sculpture in particular, it's hard to think of anywhere outside Florence that hits you so hard between the eyes in terms of artistic impact. It's sobering to read that (like many great artists, composers etc.) much of his work was actively disapproved of when he presented it. He's also less prolific than many of his contemporaries (try and name ten of his works), mainly because he spent years on each one, changing and gradually perfecting them.I've never quite worked out what the odd Van Gogh or Manet is doing in the museum, but they're nice to see.Some things irritate. It was shut on New Year's Day (why??). The entrance formalities are bureaucratic. One lady takes the money, another sells you your audio guide (a different one for each of the three sections of the museum/exhibition!), another checks your ticket at the entrance and someone else checks it later (three times in all). But you put up with all this nonsense because the overall experience is simply wonderful, memorable and moving."

But there is something special about going to an artist's home. To see where they lived, thought and entertained. The gardens are lovely. The museum with many unfinished works, models, casts, etc. is another education into his world. Also it is a great neighborhood in Paris. Very close to Les Invalides"

The sculptures are distributed throughout a garden that tends to be less crowded than other venues. The restaurant is on the edge of the garden and is quite good and reasonably priced. One tends to be overwhelmed by the Louvre and the Orsay museums but we quite enjoyed this museum. You can easily visit the museum in an 90 minutes to 2 hours. We visited on the First Sunday of the month when the museum was free and even then the crowds were reasonable. Our visit occurred in early November 2014."

We weren't too sure why but when we got there, we understood why. I would suggest to put it high on your list of \"to visit\" museums of Paris too. It is unique in that there is an indoor museum component but also an outdoor garden that features many of the pieces throughout. The garden must be beautiful in the warmer months and I am sad that I didn't get the opportunity to visit then. However, even in the middle of winter, it is worth taking a look. The cost of the ticket for just the gardens alone is very modest so if you skip it or not, it isn't a big deal. But I still recommend checking it out.It features only works from sculptor Auguste Rodin but his works are so impressive to see. The museum provides a better feature about the background for his works and background; it is in a workshop fashion. Most definitely recommended to visit anytime of year!"

Inside of the hoouse - which more like a small castle ,you can see his famous sculptures in plaster among which \"The Kiss\" so much lighter and delicate than the bronze cast."

It's small and fairly intimate inside the two buildings, and the grounds are a sculpture garden that combines nature & art in a wonderful way. There's a cafe in the garden (and clean accessible restrooms as well). Whole families can enjoy this place (as long as parents are cool with the beauty of the human body). My parents brought me here when I was young and it was the most memorable place we visited, which is why I returned on this trip. Presently there's a show about the artist's process, which I hope will become permanent."

Is this line to go into the house, because we just want to go around the grounds.\" So we figured out that we could bust out of the line and wander about the grounds to our heart's content. Our mood improved after that. I can't say what we missed inside the actual museum, but from my wife's research, the main attractions are outside, and I think she's right. There were a lot of Rodin's most famous works all around the massive grounds, and we could enjoy them in the kind of atmosphere where they were intended to be seen. The path eventually led to the highlight: the courtyard with The Thinker. So we sat and admired it for a while, and then I took the requisite photo of my daughter in a thoughtful pose (had to stand in line behind other people with the same idea)."

Rodin negotiated with the French government to turn over this lovely mansion (in which he lived in his later years, located right next to Hotel des Invalides / Napoleon's Tomb) to become a museum if he donated most of his stunning sculptures and other personal collection (including a Van Gogh and some of his own paintings). The result is a gem of a museum with a reasonable entry fee (6 Euro if you want to see the sculptures on the inside of the mansion, even less if you just want to stroll the gardens - which house larger versions of many of the same sculptures). However if you want to really learn more and understand his works, get the Audio Guide (4 Euro) and go inside to see the progression of his masterpieces, including The Thinker, The Kiss, and the origins of his greatest work (located outside in breathtaking full-on beauty) - the Gates of Hell. The gardens themselves are worth a stroll, and on leaving you will have a sense of this great artist and the scope of his work - plus the context in which he created them. Definitely a must see if you have a few days in Paris."

Paris Museum Pass offers free entry - the museum consists of the collection in the 18th century Hotel Biron, BEAUTIFUL grounds, gardens and a temporary exhibition hall. We did not have sufficient time to visit the temporary exhibition as we spent a lot of time at Musee de l'Armee at Les Invalides. In addition to the beautiful sculptures displayed in Hotel Biron, one is also treated to three beautiful Van Gogh paintings! The gardens are beautiful and also reminded me of the grounds of Hellbrunn palace in Salzburg. During our visit, contemporary sculptures of Daniel Dewar and Gregory Gicquel were also on display! I really enjoyed the ten contemporary sculptures on display - Pied (Foot), L'id\u00e9e (Idea) and Buste (Chest) were among the favourites. I bought a Rodin Flesh and Marble (8\u20ac) guide at the bookshop to study further at home. We used the Varenne Metro stop that is very close to the museum to go home. I will definitely visit Musee Rodin again on a next visit to Paris, but will allow enough time to relax in the beautiful gardens! Also consider the late opening on a Wednesday until 8:45pm."

That being said, when we got in, it was a nicely set of exhibits that showcase the artist's distinct periods of his life. Carry the brochure around that describes the different rooms so you can correlate the pieces to the periods. (no one gives you the brochure - you just have to find it in the main house.) There are sculptures outside as well, and the garden must have been lovely in the spring (we went in the fall). We read that they are going to renovate the buildings, which is much needed. But it's a nice collection of his work, of course mostly given by the artist himself, and the museum was a former hotel that he favored, so it is a nice place to visit."

There was no line when I was there. The artwork in the mansion is placed in order of when the work was done. You can see how Rodin developed his work over time and reused themes he developed while working on the Gates of Hell. An extra bonus for this museum are the paintings by Monet, Renoir and Van Gogh, which were in Rodin's personal collections. The museum can easily be reached by the Metro with the Varenne stop being the closest. It is also close to the Army Museum and Napoleon's tomb if you wish to do more than one museum in the day."

One one trip, I brought my kids and there was an exhibit comparing the work of Rodin to that of Robert Mapplethorpe, which was a little too erotic for children, so I quickly ushered them through that gallery! Other than that, the kids all enjoyed the sculpture garden and appreciated seeing the art in a setting that wasn't stuffy or crammed full of people. The sculptures are interesting as well as the history surrounding them. On my next visit I will go to the Rodin Museum in Meudon."

I loved this beautiful museum which is forward thinking not only in keeping an eye out for its visitors and patrons, but in explicating who Rodin was and organizing his works appropriately. There are two floors; the renovations are to install an elevator and to shore up the building so that it can continually support the weight of the sculptures (some in marble, some in lead, some in bronze.) The works are organized basically in the order of his creative execution. Were you aware that Rodin's genius also extended to paintings and even of famous artists? Yes. Were you aware that his beloved Camille Claudel has a separate section for her works...and that they are absolutely incredible? Yes! Camille Claudel is a genius. In some ways her works exceed Rodin's artistry and conceptualizations. She certainly was a brilliant sculptor in her own right. As time moves on, who she is will come to be appreciated and embraced by women and men globally. She was and continues to be a maverick; her work is breathtaking. I loved \"The Wave.\" It is hard to select a favorite because all of her works are spectacular. The museum gardens are truly lovely and extend from the front and around to back. there is information about the building that is the museum; and there is an explanation as to when Paul Claudel decided to bequeath his sister's works to the museum. Yeah! Interestingly, members of the Claudel family are alive today; thank goodness they are extremely proud...beyond proud and appreciative of their brilliant relative Camille. (There was a terrible time when they were ashamed of her...very sad.) Be sure you take a picture by Rodin's \"Gates of Hell,\" a seminal work. But pray before you do (just joking). I had the great good fortune to receive a private tour by French author and researcher of Rodin and Camille Claudel, Jeanne Fayard. She has written a number of works including those on Rodin and Claudel; she also met Tennessee Williams and gave one of the foremost interviews of Williams (this is in a book that was published in the US) in which Williams felt so comfortable with her, he \"let his hair down\" and revealed more of his interests because he felt she was NOT judgmental. Anyway, she guided me through the museum which she knows by heart and discussed the history of Camille and Rodin. We did not get to the cafe, unfortunately which was closing. However, I recommend two things. You can spend hours there and people do. After taking a tour or just familiarizing yourself with his and Camille's works, you can stop at the cafe or go into the gardens take pictures and/or enjoy a meditative leisurely time. We went on a weekday. If you can, it's better to go then and avoid what will be crowds, most likely. I would go back in a heartbeat because you cannot get all of it in two visits with an expert like Jeanne Fayard...and this is a place to ruminate (like Le Pensee), and take in the beauty, study both sculptors, if you like, and be yourself. IF YOU DON'T APPRECIATE SCULPTURE, you can appreciate the gardens. But if video games are your thing...stay home. This is not for you. I would take children who are perceptive and have a depth of understanding or those who you want to introduce these eternal artists to...who you are giving an introduction to. If they are artistic...bien sur!"

There was one of Victor Hugo which looked very much like him. The Gates of Hell attracts the most attention in the rear garden.In the house, the famous piece is the Kiss.

Many great sculptures by the master including The Thinker and The Kiss...along with renditions OF the master by other artists...and the garden is probably even more amazing than the museum itself - a great and important Parisian art institution."

I saw it about 10 years ago but it was at the top of my list to revisit on this trip to Paris. And this is the house in which the artist lived. The larger bronzes are displayed in beautiful garden settings behind the house. The entire property is surrounded by a 10 foot high stone wall so it is very peaceful inside the gardens while all the noise of Paris goes on outside. The other treat was seeing 3 fabulous Van Gogh paintings on the wall that were in the artist's personal collection. I just came from Amsterdam where I visited the Van Gogh Museum that had mobs of people and dimly lit their paintings. Trust me, these 3 Van Gogh paintings at this museum are outstanding and you can walk right up to them to examine them. In short, this is one of those small gem art museums that you'll fondly remember from your trip to Paris more than visiting the mega art museums that are mobbed and frequently more annoying than enjoyable."

The museum now has a modern entrance (and of course the mandatory book store and place to buy replicas of Rodin sculpture). The highllight of the museum is the garden. All the classic Rodin pieces (the Gates of Hell, the Thinker, the Shades, Balzac, the Burghers of Calais) are out there in a peaceful setting. To the left as you enter in the garden is a setting through glass of dozens of pieces I certainly had not heard of or seen 40 years ago. The day we were there was an early fall day and the leaves were turning and the air was crisp and it was glorious to see all of the studies for major pieces as well as the pieces outside.After the peace of the garden and the history that was conveyed on some displays, we went into the building (hotel) where Rodin kept his studio in his last years. It is not great, but it is good to see the progression of his skills from the inauspicious beginnings to greatness. There are three Van Goghs (one very good) and several other pieces he collected. Not a deep indoor collection, but some of the early models for great works and you can see their development. This is a great museum now and I am sure with the continuing improvements and scholarship it will be even better."

It has been a museum showcasing Rodin\u2019s work since 1919. It is interesting to note that Rodin started life out as a decorative bricklayer. I went on a Friday in the early afternoon outside of peak tourist season and thought it would be quiet but there were still quite a few people so I am not sure when the best time to go would be. It is a nice few hours spent. You can do it all in two hours or less unless you really want to hang out in the gardens and/or have lunch or a snack in the restaurant located in the right hand side garden. I highly suggest trying to go on a nice day, i.e. no rain, because there are as many nice sculptures to see outside as there are inside. This is especially true for those who enjoy taking photos. The Thinker is one of the most famous of Rodin\u2019s works and although I appreciate it, it is not one of my favorite works of his. There always seem to be crowds around this sculpture, located outside, in particular. If there are too many people, move on and come back to it later. The Thinker is sitting on a stone and I hate to I say it, but to me it just looks like a guy sitting on a toilet focused on doing his business! One of the bronze sculptures that merits close scrutiny outside is Rodin\u2019s \u201cLa porte de l\u2019enfer\u201d (The Gates of Hell), which depicts a scene from Dante\u2019s \u201cThe Inferno\u201d. This piece has 180 figures and he worked on it over a span of 37 years. The sculpture was commissioned by the Directorate of Fine Arts and was intended to be the entrance to a planned Decorative Arts Museum, but the museum was never built in the end. I must say that this sculpture needs to be cleaned desperately by the museum because there currently is so much dirt, dust and presumably bird excrement on it, particularly at the upper levels of the piece. In addition to Rodin\u2019s works there are several pieces by Camille Claudel, who was his apprentice, lover and muse. The tragic Camille suffered from mental health issues, ended up destroying much of her work, and was placed in an asylum, where she spent 30 years until her death at age 78 in 1943. There are renovations going onside through 2015 but they do not hinder the visit. The temporary presentation of the collections is well thought out. There is a nice gift shop at the entry/exit. Toilet facilities can easily be found throughout."

The Thinker and Gates of Hell are the main ones that draw the photo-crowds - but a walk to the other end of the garden opens out to a small shaded area that looks back through the garden to the house. thoughtfully placed benched and further back deckchairs make it a place to linger.This time we stopped for coffee in the small caf\u00e9 to the side of the garden - I had resisted previous time as I tend to think a captive audience means hiked up prices. we were really surprised coffees were cheaper than in the places we had lunch and dinner!..and all served with a smile.a good way to spend a couple of hours."

It's a stunning piece which took 37 years to complete.

Boy was he correct.The museum is right next to the Varenne stop on the Metro and so is easy to get to.

This is one of the less-stressful destinations because it's not super-crowded and there are places to sit and relax. It's also \"do-able\", meaning you don't feel you have to cover every inch of the place to get a good feeling of what's offered. Wander around the garden for sure, and try your best to enjoy some of the art inside as well. Sometimes it's better to start upstairs and work your way down. I always think it's smart to ask someone who works there how to best navigate the place, with regard to the amount of people there and what's just not to be missed."

The location is convenient, the garden is extremely well kept. His work is just breathtaking. No visit to Paris can be complete without visiting this charming museum. Purchasing your ticket on the internet could save you half an hour. Important note: Rodin museum's ticket is also valid for the Musee D'Orsay."

At the entry point to go inside you are ushered into a Robert Maplethorpe exhibit which we found only mildly interesting. One can find this part of the museum offensive or amusing. Your choice. We found it neither actually but sort of a non-event.The prime part of the Rodin museum occurs both indoors and outdoors. Indoors is where you find The Kiss and many other impressive Rodin creations. The outdoors however dominates with the most famous The Thinker and the statue of Balzac. The gardens outside are gentle to the mind while you stroll! And don't miss the Burghers of Calais out and about.The indoor of the Rodin is not to be missed. As I said The Kiss is there and so are many other famous Rodin creations, including other versions of The Thinker and a wonderful Evard Munch painting of The Thinker. Also there are some very interesting Impressionist paintings, Van Gogh, etc.Don't miss this prime destination! We easily combined this with a trip to Musee d'Orsay which is a not far away. We allocated 2/3's of our time to Orsay and 1/3 to Rodin, BIG TIP--you can get a combined admission ticket for both of these locations. But we chose to do this differently but getting a Paris Museum Pass which skipped us up to the front of the line for both museums."

We had an afternoon free and, after the obligatory tour of the Eiffel tower, decided to walk to the Rodin Museum and visit the gardens, which are much cheaper than seeing the museum itself. We passed by Invalides and the beautiful golden dome along the walk through safe neighborhoods with plenty of cafes. Once there, we enjoyed the lovely gardens, interesting sculptures, great photo ops, and seeing \"the Thinker\". Some of the modern sculptures are funny, including a toilet, where you may pose as \"the Stinker\" ala Will Ferrell. After battling the hordes at the Eiffel Tower and other tourist spots, we were pleasantly surprised by the relatively few and smaller tour groups here and the calmer quieter aspects. There are plenty of places to sit in sun or shade, a nice little cafe, and super clean free bathrooms. Should I visit Paris again, I would want to stop here again and peruse the museum as well. This museum is covered by a Paris Museum pass. There is no reason not to stop in for a few hours if you want to get away from the crowds."

There is a long queue to get in, so I highly recommend getting your ticket online before you even get there. If you buy your ticket online, I also recommend lumping it together with the d'Orsay ticket so you can save some money. Even though the line is long, it is so spacious outside that it's hardly noticeable that there are a lot of people present. Take your time to stroll, sit, and just take it all in. Once inside, it gets more crowded. People flock around the Thinker, which is pretty sad - is that the only reason to go? Certainly not! There is so much to see and take it. I would recommend setting aside at least 2 hours (minimum) to enjoy all of the work of Rodin. There is a large cafe outside that you can get food and beverages at."

My favorite sculptures were \" Le Penseur\" (The Thinker) which is very famous, and \"The Gates of Hell\" which is a depiction of Dante's Inferno which is incredibly detailed and interesting. This can be an excellent spot to photograph the chapel dome of Les Invalides, which is visible from the garden. The garden also has a nice cafe for lunch or a break, and this seems a bit silly to note, but they have well maintained restrooms, which can be hard to find when touristing around Paris. Overall, this is a nice place to visit which offers a respite from the hustle and bustle of the city."

My favorite is 'Hands of God', that sculpture just leaves me in awe each time I see it. His sculpture with the hands are just amazing! Then there is 'The Kiss', this sensuous and moving work you can circle around in the musuem and just admire the detail he provides. Definitely check this out when you are in the 6th or 7th arrondisment. Also It is included in the Paris Museum Pass."

The historic Hotel is under much needed renovation but remains open, at least half of it, until the completion in 2015. Being able to stroll admist many fine and interesting pieces of work in an atmopshere of where the great artist lived and worked sure beats the competition for human space found in many of the other great Paris museums. Do not miss touring the grounds, the works of art, Rodin\u2019s workshops, and the lovely gardens provide another perspective. Combined with high walls and abundant trees, only the gold Invalide dome over Napoleon\u2019s tomb reminds you that you are indeed in the middle of the city. If you stroll to the very end of the garden, pass through the arch in the middle of the hedge. A surprise awaits you. The Musee de Rodin is a place where you can return on each visit to Paris and enjoy as if it is your first visit."

This time I visited with my family and could not wait to show them the beautiful works of Rodin and sit in the lovely gardens with a cup of tea! We booked on line the day before in order to avoid the crowds lining up for tickets. All very well because we forgot to download the tickets onto the phone, only had the booking cost on the phone. Not enough for the miserable ticket inspectors at the museum. They would not believe us even though we showed that we had booked the tickets and they could easily check on the internet. They claimed they had no internet (?) and so we paid again with no chance of recouping our money already spent. Our fault, but a little leeway would have been appreciated, so beware other travellers - be smarter than us. The rudeness of the people at the museum did not end there! We had a child in a pram and went up the ramp to the disabled door expecting to be let in. The door was opened, we were told we were not disabled and a finger was pointed to the front door with many steps in front! We then heard the person say \"bloody English!\" We retorted that we were not English but Australian and were very surprised by this further rudeness. This was a ridiculous welcome to the museum! So, back we went and up the stairs carrying the stroller. A very bad start to the visit altogether. Wandered around the outside garden enjoying the beauty and the artwork, but a bad feeling stayed with us and we did not enjoy the visit at all. The museum is beautiful though and well worth a visit. It was incredibly disappointing that the staff were so badly trained and so rude."

Strolling around the garden is really pleasant with various rose flower planted around and the walled borders well shaded with trees. The sculptures in the garden are not many but amazing pieces of work including the famous The Thinker and Gates of Hell. The garden setting only enhances the viewing experience of these sculptures. There were few sculptures of another artist on display when I visited the museum (don't remember the name) which really complemented the works of Rodin and had a modern aesthetic to it. Another plus of the museum is the cafe located in the gardens which have nice outdoor seating in a corner of the garden and very reasonably priced pastries. Would definitely recommend this museum if looking for a break from other more well known Paris attractions."

Now we can adore it, and scrutinize it in every details.There are many sculptures in the garden, but my other favorite was the Les Bourgeois de Calais. Especially, since I was able to walk around and examine closely every figure, every posture, and every face. It was a great experience.Pour flowers.

The garden in interspersed with sculpture, including a copy of The Thinker (the original is apparently at his home and he and his wife are buried underneath). The Gates of Hell is amazing and the detail deserves an up close look. The gardens themselves are lovely- beautiful roses in the front and tall shady trees in the back. The formal grounds in the back were so green and lush. The museum itself is very nicely laid out. There's something to see in every room and they've curated it so that displays and room make sense. Starting from young Rodin, through his explorations in various media, you can see his progression as an artist.The best part of the museum is that unlike some others, you can take some time and not feel rushed by large crowds. We did not eat in the caf\u00e9 but the gift shop was very nice- with things you actually might want to purchase that represent the artist and the museum."

The size of this museum adds to it's allure, it is not as big as many of the other art museums in Paris so it contributes to the laid back atmosphere of the museum and you are able to focus on Rodin!"

It is also neighbor to the less touristy Army museum which is also quite beautiful and interesting. Varenne metro is right there and some buses go there as well. Loved it, and I am not necessarily a Rodinist, though am familiar with some of his work, which says a lot about the place. There is a convenient locker room and in general great informative service.

This was my daughter's second time in Paris, and I felt that she was old enough to appreciate the art the city had to offer, so we started with the outdoors and sculptures. We had a lovely time looking at the art and taking pictures. It was a nice educational visit, without the outward trimmings of learning, which some times put young people off museums. There were lines, something I had never experienced in all the times I've visited the museum, and for the 1st time I did not get the museum pass, but I highly recommend it, as it was hard to wait in the head with a child, and watch the smart people go right passed with the pass!"

We purchased a 4 day Pass and it is a great deal if you like to walk around Paris and enjoy the great museums found here."

We paid our entry fee (by the way check out the special rates for students or residence Visa holders and if you are also going to the Musee d'Orsay by the combo ticket) and entered. We took our lunch and at it in the park area of the museum. The outdoor portion is a lovely rose garden interspersed with many Rodin sculptures, including the famous Thinker. You can take as many pictures as you like. I would say to try to go on a day with pleasant weather but the day we were there it rained off and on and we just went inside for a bit during the times it rained. Take at least 2 hours here."

We went on a Sunday afternoon in June and were disappointed that there was a fairly long line (we waited for more than 30 minutes and it was hot!) and no specific entrances for Museum Pass, until we got to security at the front door. It was very busy with other tourists, so we had to stand in another queue to get into the house itself. Too packed, making it difficult to see the casts and other sculptures inside the house - also, quite a few of the rooms were closed as they are still under renovation. The gardens were lovely, but again, many sculptures were on temporary plinths. 'Thinker' was awesome but crowded with folks trying to get selfies - worth a visit but maybe go first thing in the morning to enjoy some space! PS: The Mapplethorpe exhibit is wonderful, especially pairing it with Rodin, but be aware if you are with little ones - some explicit photography :O"

I had bought my own lunch and it was nice to sit in the sun to eat. Inside there was a Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition, an American photographer. They had tried to link his works to Rodin's work, which I found a bit forced and silly but despite this I really enjoyed his photos.

The interaction between the settings, both the chateau in which it is housed and the gardens around the home, set off the genius of Rodin's sculptures.Having several versions of the same piece allows the viewer to watch the creative process as you see the original design and the finished product. An unexpected attraction are works by several of Rodin's contemporaries, including van Gogh, Monet and John Singer Sargent. The cafe in the garden is also enjoyable, with a lovely view of the gardens. Highly recommend it for anyone going to Paris. If you know ahead of time that you plan to go, would recommend reading up on the background for the creation of The Burghers of Calais as the impact will be even more meaningful."

We were lucky to be at Musee Rodin when exhibition by Robert Mapplethorpe was on, it was a great comparison of Rodin's work and the photography of Mapplethorpe. An eye opening exhibition but explanations comparing the two artists made it all worth while to look closely at exhibits and try to understand the thinking of the each artist.Hotel Biron was interesting to walk through at our own pace, then the gardens were equally a joy. Sculptures mixed in with landscaped gardens. Bonus was the cafe in the garden where we had a lovely lunch."

Visitors are offered insight into Rodin's world. He was a prolific artist and this museum shows not only finished work but the process, which is really engaging. The subjects of his work provide insight into French culture and values.Musee Rodin is a special oasis in the hear of Paris that is much less busy than many other museums we visited in Paris. Hands down it was my 10-year old daughter's favourite cultural attraction. She stuck her finger in Balzac's eye!Please buy your tickets online first to avoid the line. You can buy a discounted ticket with Musee d'Orsay if you plan to see both in the same day.Of course there is a gift shop but the goods are interesting and relevant.

Especially for people who aren't \"Art Buffs\", the experience of seeing a beautiful sculpture in 3D can be much more fulfilling than a hanging painting that you probably have seen in print before. It is also housed where his working studio was which adds that extra historical touch."

Thanks to our Museum Pass, we did not have to wait at the entrance (but the queue was not too long anyway).This museum is created by Rodin himself back in 1916 and included not only his work but also his private art collection, library, his archive of letters and manuscripts. The building itself, the famous Hotel Briton is dating early 18th century, it was used as a private house, girls' school and was finally rented as a workshop to artists such as Jean Cocteau, Henri Matisse, \u0130sadora Duncan, poet Rilke. Combined with awesome sculptures of Rodin, this place is full of art, history and nature. The gardens are amazing: inside there is a caf\u00e9, you can buy some drinks, something light to eat and spend the whole day in the gardens... As it's not as crowded as d'orsay or Louvre, you can take as much time as you want to enjoy the museum, without any hussle. Famous sculptures of Rodin such as Le Penseur and Le Baiser are breathtaking.... This gem of art and history must be a part of any Paris visit, you won't regret it...."

In fact, the grounds are the largest, privately held in the city of Paris. The grounds are definitely family friendly. It was a lovely day for our tour, hopefully when you go to visit the weather will be nice. You can see Invalidies and the Eiffel Tower from the grounds. The mus\u00e9e is currently under renovation. So, parts of H\u00f4tel Biron are closed at the moment. I would encourage you not to let you discourage you from the visit. Rodin was a prolific sculpture and made f 6,500 sculptures and 6,500 drawings and other art works and the works of many of his contemporaries that made up his own private collection. There is still a lot to see and enjoy.H\u00f4tel Biron was built in the early 18th century. It spent time as a school for young girls and then in 1904 it was handed to the French state. It was after this that Rodin was a tenant, along with Henri Matisse, Joan Coctuea (a writer), Isadora Duncan (a dancer) and Rainer Maria Rilke (a poet). Je took over the whole building in 1911. It was handed over to the state later and turned into a museum two years after he died.Don\u2019t miss \u201cThe Thinker\u201d, \u201cThe Gates of ****\u201d or his private collection. It appeared that some of his own private collection maybe loaned out at the moment. In particular his Van Gogh paintings are at the D\u2019Orsay at the special exhibit. Just another excuse to see another lovely Paris museum!"

The story of how this came to be a museum is probably unique, and therefore fascinating.Personally, I love Rodin's work, the energy and the art he brings to sculpture (as opposed to a more workmanlike classical style like Michelangelo's). The gardens at Musee Rodin offer an interesting progression through Rodin's work, showing the individual pieces he worked with before you get to the stunning Gates of Hell and Burghers of Calais, which contain individual figures you recognize from other sculptures. It's nearly spiritual to see The Thinker.The garden, as its name implies, is outside and therefore subject to all the fickleness of the outdoors. In our case, it was alternately raining and mosquitoing. This is not in any way the museum's fault, but a factor to be considered in your visit."

It's one of the principal spaces where Rodin lived and worked, and his outsize presence can still be felt, especially in the expansive gardens, where it's easy to imagine the sculptor pacing out the design of his next masterpiece. Even those not wholly enamored of Rodin's particular style may come away persuaded by the works on offer here, which include his remarkable \"Gates of Hell\" (part of an unrealized commission) and the transcendent \"The Kiss.\" And whether you think you will or not, you're bound to have a selfie taken beneath \"The Thinker.\" The house itself offers valuable insights into both Rodin's process and the work of his contemporaries, with some pieces by Camille Claudel that are the equal of the master's. The grounds are also home to a lovely cafe, which unlike so many museum restaurants in Paris is an actual cafeteria, so there's no problem with service, and there is more than ample seating outside (less so on a rainy day). After your visit to the museum, take a walk through the surrounding neighborhood, once the city's most elegant address, with block-long mansions that once belonged to storied families, now serving as government offices. The Invalides and its grassy esplanade are also just around the corner."

The French government bought the building and Rodin negotiated being able to stay there by donating many of his sculptures. As such, it's a very unique space, providing context not usually included when viewing an artist's work.The garden is amazing to wander through on a nice day. Rodin placed his works throughout, and seeing them in an outdoor setting is fantastic. The works of art themselves are not to be missed, the level of detail in his sculptures show a masterful understanding of the human form.There are so many fantastic museums in Paris, but this one is not to be missed."

I only stopped in to use the bathroom and ended up staying here for an hour, and then brought the rest of my group back later. Go on a sunny day to see the gardens and fountain at their best."

Rodin used the Hotel Biron as his workshop during his life and left his entire collection of sculptures and some paintings by Renoir and Van Gogh to the state, on condition that they use the building as a museum to display his works.The gardens are magnificent, with sculptures dotted throughout, and the house is beautiful in its own right, as well as containing a treasure trove of studies and plaster casts of his works, along with the paintings he acquired from other artists.Rodin's larger bronze pieces are the big drawcards - the Gates of Hell is magnificent, as is the Burghers of Calais and the famous The Thinker. But the numerous smaller pieces inside the house are just as fascinating.You could breeze through in an hour if you're short on time, but could also easily spend longer dallying in the beautiful gardens if you're so inclined.There is a garden cafe - we didn't eat there but the food looked and smelt really good. Prices were in the usual tourist-inflated range, but there isn't much choice in the immediate neighbourhood.Buy tickets online and skip the queues - we bought a double ticket that gave discounted entry to both Musee Rodin and Musee d'Orsay. The two sites are about a 10-15 minute walk apart, so easy to cover both in one day."

I was able to see this sculpture but I also enjoyed the rest of the garden and the work in the house.Let me also recommend the Paris Museum Pass.

As you wander the pathways you come upon The Thinker, Balzac, Ugolin in the middle of a pool, The Burghers of Calais and The Three Shades in the rose garden. Inside the a Hotel Biron is the permanent collection of bronzes and plaster casts by Rodin and works by some of his contemporaries, including Camille Claudel. The lovely old buildings and the gardens help to make it one of the most relaxing museum visits I have ever experienced, and it did not feel excessively crowded."

Stroll the garden and view, The Thinker and other sculptures by Rodin. There is even a cafe to sit and sip a coffee on a spring day. Inside the old house you view The Kiss and other works. They regulate the number of people in the house so that you can stroll through it in a relaxed fashion. They are in the middle of doing some renovations, which the house needs inside. A Maplethorp display in the chapel compares Rodin's work in sculpture to his photography. They are a surprising reflection of each other. Enjoy!"

I'd just finished Camille Claudel the film when I went and managed to pick out 'The Thinker' sitting on top of 'The Gates of Hell'. There are a variety of pieces from his personal collection (works not his own) and many statues he began or left unfinished; we get, as visitors, a personal insight into his work as it took shape. The centre-piece is 'The Thinker' which lies in the courtyard- one might remember it being featured during Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris recently- is just fantastic."

I was somewhat surprised to see some tourists bringing quite small children into the Maplethorpe section, possibly setting them up (both male and female) for a life time of crushing disappointment. 'No honey, they are not all that size.' Note to TripAdvisor - I bet you censor this one, though I hope not. Back to the Rodin side of things, the gardens are beautiful, the cafe is good.

I don't recall an entry line at all two years ago and so didn't expect to be so completely happy to have those passes in hand.This time we focussed on the big pieces in the garden. I was surprised that despite the long entry line, the garden was not crowded. I think this might have been because there was a new queue forming to see thd special exhibit in the older building. I felt that since it was not yet raining that I was able to take in the garden as a garden with the pieces forming a pleasant counterpoint to the landscaping. Fewer people also seemed to mean fewer people posing in front of the bronzes, which gave greater opportunity walk around, step back, and view in contemplation."

It is a museum that you feel you can actually take in - small and accessible. On a nice day the gardens themselves are sufficient. A great cultural activity that doesn't take a lot of logistical planning to accomplish."

Unfortunately the weather was not the best so that I spent the majority of time in the inside part of the museum which was not that exciting (unless you are a really big fan of Rodin). However the gardens are just beautiful! I absolutely loved the iconic statue and moreover enjoyed the gardens in general. There is a lovely cafe where you can overcome a little rain tasting some of the tastiest macaroons. Also if lucky you may rest on of the benches while reading a book or perhaps writing a poem.Overall it is beautiful, however if you are in Paris just for a few days I personally think that there are much better things to do and see in Cit\u00e9 de la Lumi\u00e9re :-)"

Unless you are a fanatic, you can visit this museum in 1/2 hours; spend longer in the gardens/"

The garden itself is beautiful and nice to walk through, and the sculptures are situated throughout the garden in a great way. It also wasn't too crowded when we went ( 4pm on a Saturday) which is a huge bonus in Paris.The FREE telescopes pointed towards the 'Gates of Hell' piece were so helpful and allowed for closer inspection of the intricacies included in the sculpture. It really made it even more impressive."

His most important works are here, and in a great setting. Rodin himself used to use the place as his workshop, although the larger pieces were made in Meudon where the second Rodin museum is located (just a 15 min ride outside Paris, SW of the city centre). Hotel Biron is currently under reconstruction so not all the permanent pieces are exhibited. The reconstruction will finish in 2015. On the website of the museum further details concerning the reconstruction can be found (www.musee-rodin.fr). A gift shop is located next to the main entrance. There is a restaurant in the garden. I'm a great fan of Rodin's pupil and lover Camille Claudel. She inspired many of his works and apparently assisted him in the realisation as well. As a woman she never had the same recognition as he did... Success is always related to power isn't it. Camille died in a psychiatric hospital. Her works touch the heart. Deeply and endearingly. Her splendid work \"Abandon\" wasn't on display as we visited the museum. But other pieces were. Other art by artists that were contemporaries of Rodin is also part of the permanent collection. I clicked very good instead of excellent because of the inconveniences of the reconstruction. The museum is definitely worth the visit, also before 2015! Access for the disabled will be improved after the renovation."

You see beginning draft work right down to the finished piece. I really enjoyed learning about the love of his life Camille Claudel - I actually found her pieces pulled me into their playfulness and I wish she had more for me to see! There are also a few of Rodin's personal paintings by Van Gogh and Monet and Renoir. See the pieces in the gallery first and then tour the garden to see the finished pieces of the Thinker and the Gates of Hell in the fountain. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because they had a fashion week event being set-up in the garden which spoiled much of the overall experience of the peaceful garden setting.

However, at the moment the house is closed and is a construction site, the gardens behind the house are mud and (of course) bare trees and much of the garden was inaccessible anyway because they were erecting a huge tent structure - presumably for some sort of function as this museum is privately funded and has to raise money though private functions. Still it would be a great place to visit when it is all open and the gardens are green."

Since art is a very personal thing, you should check out Auguste Rodin's sculptures on-line before you attend if you don't know anything about his style, but just about everyone knows \"The Thinker\" and \"the Kiss\". This museum has the advantage of having a beautiful garden containing his larger pieces, where you can find a quiet spot to just sit and ponder or chat quietly in the cafe, and then carry on with the rest of the museum. You can cover the whole place in a few hours. One tip is to get there early and avoid the queues that form on the street and inside the gate. Besides, the roses are better earlier in the morning, even if the best sculpture in the world is not your style! ;-)"

When we were there, an exhibit of Camille Claudel's sculptures was being shown, and I particularly appreciated her work, having read about her and seen an old film about her, it was touching to see her work there among that of Rodin, a man she loved so passionately."

They are refurbishing it now so it may well be better in the future but could be a bit of disappointment before it's finished. One particularly nice bonus is they have some of the works of Camille Claudel (his wife and student). Where Rodin shows raw energy and power in his sculpture, she shows incredible sensitivity. Frankly, there are times when I like her work better as it conveys beauty while Rodin's often conveys pain, suffering and anguish."

To dedicate a musee to a French sculptor is one thing, but to consecrate a beautiful building to house a collection that exceeds 6600 sculptures,8000 drawings,8000 old photographs and 7000 objets d'art,is simply amazing,astounding and profoundly intriguing. The prodigious Rodin was a master of his craft and as you are assaulted by the sheer volume and intoxicating depth of his character,you begin to appreciate the complexity,warmth and passion, that his collections evoke. So,if you want to see 'The Thinker,The Kiss and the Gates of hell', you have to pay homage at this remarkable edifice located near Varenne Metro station. The gardens is where you will appreciate many of his large and whimsical works in a natural surrounding with a lake, and a small eatery. The galleries along the garden paths are a tranquil oasis. Considering you are within striking distance of Invalids and the Eiffel tower,this 18th century mansion is surrounded by 3 hectares of peaceful and romantic gardens decorated with plants,shrubs that showcase Robin's sculptures. But its only inside that you see the magic which his avid collections of drawings,engravings,ceramics and antiques, truly enriches our sense of the charm and sophistication that this master conveys. The diversity of his offerings is amazing,for not only did he create,but was an avid collector of other artists' works. See if you pick the casual,Monet,van Gogh and Renoirs around. I was astounded by how much his works were based on allegory and mythology.  You lovers of curves,will not miss the definite Rubenesque touches to his figures. i was particularly drawn to his drawings, which are equally mesmerising as his sculptures. This establishment cannot be viewed in a hurry,so rewind your time-clock and allow the beauty and the magic to seep- in.  I am thirsting now to see his studio in the heights of Meudon and wish i could attend the wonderful programmes of events that always occure when i am not here. Boo-Hoo."

We used Rick Steves Guide book to get more explanations of the life of Rodin, how the museum came to be and the background on many of his sculptures. Rodin's works are found both in the museum as well as the surrounding gardens, which were beautifully maintained. Unlike so many famous painters/sculpturers of his era whose works were largely unappreciated during their lifetimes, Rodin achieve fame for his work during his lifetime and used that fame to ensure the mansion where he had worked would be turned into a museum and his works exhibited for all to see."

The Montmartre Museum and the Rodin are more digestible. They all have their place you just have to know your appetite."

The exhibit areas are still just rooms in an old house, with little apparent environmental controls (the windows were open when we were there), but that does make for an interesting, in situ sort of experience. The gardens are really nice, with the major statues placed here and there. However, while we were there, there had apparently just been a fashion show in the gardens and bunches of workers were there dismantling a huge tent, which detracted from the ambience and cut off access to part of the gardens. Gift shop/welcome center is much improved."

I am not the biggest fan of museums, and as such don't visit huge numbers...friends suggested this one, and as The Thinker is a piece I do appreciate I thought \"why not\". I was very pleasantly surprised. The Museum is easy to find, and easy to get in to without huge queues first off. It is an old house and the exhibits are spread around the house, and also the gardens. Make sure you pick a dry day to go to this as the gardens to me are the highlight. Lots of great photo opportunities with these extraordinary pieces in very attractive grounds, well manicured and kept. The house section is well laid out and takes you around in a circuit. The highlights for me are The Gates of Hell and of course The Thinker in the gardens. Very interesting exhibition though and highly recommended. As far as museums go I would say fine for kids too, the gardens being a place for them to run off energy, and the house section not being terribly big and could hold their attention for the hour to visit that part. Also of note was a very nice cafe in the grounds, with decent and healthy food as well as Carb loaded treats. All up, a worthwhile visit a little off the main circuit in Paris."

Lots of hammers banging and loud workmen which disturbed what would normally be a quiet, peaceful respite from the bustling city.

Inside, we had to park the stroller and carry our little person which was not at all satisfactory. He was protesting and one of the attendants came and told us to leave just as I was calming him down. We just ignored her and continued on. Little kids can safely walk independently and explore outdoors but give the indoors a miss. The flowers and garden beds are lovely. There are toilet facilities but I couldn't find a nappy change place. The pathways were easy to navigate with a stroller. I think this is a really good place to let the little people enjoy garden and art combined.

When you get to see the sculptures close up you cannot help be amazed at how much expression Rodin could bring to each individual study. The faces seem alive and although the eyes are made from clay (in the studies for the bronze sculptures\" it is as if you are looking at a live person. The most interesting thing for me, other than the sculptures were the very early landscapes Rodin did as a young artist.

Officically this is supposed to be completed in 2015, but staff told me that, because of financial woes plaguing the project, inside word is that it won't be completed until at least 2016, maybe longer. In the meantime ( we visited in September 2013 ) the Rodin is a shadow of its former self. Virtually all of the fabulous, best sculptures have been removed, placed in storage or traveling ( to help raise money for the restoration ). In their place is a mess of second rate works and models for final works, most of them small and undistinguished. A real shame for visitors who haven't been tipped off by the usual variety of U.S. Paris guidebooks. Part of the garden has been unaffected by the restoration project. There you can still see bronze greats such as Balzac, The Thinker, and the Gates of Hell. But a good part of the garden has been devoted on apparently continuous special uses by non-connected parties, rented out by the Rodin as part of the restoration fund raising. So even the lovely garden has been compromised. Having thrilled to see the sculptures in the house during our 1989 Paris trip, we were keenly disappointed to go through the Rodin last month under the circumstances described. It will be interesting to see if 2014 U. S. Paris guidebooks level with their buyers re what's really going on at the Rodin and re what that means."

We headed first to the gardens (which we were told cost nothing to visit) and low and behold, there is The Thinker sitting amongst rose bushes. We must have taken a dozen photos from all sides before I even realized that the Eiffel Tower was in the background.It was a glorious day without a cloud in the sky and the sculptures were very impressive. I cannot stress enough the importance of buying the audio guide. We learned so much which just added to the enjoyment.Then we went inside and saw some of Rodin's smaller pieces in different mediums. It was just so impressive. Then back to the gardens and we stopped at the lovely snack shop and got something to drink and just enjoyed people watching and relaxing in such a great atmosphere."

It was a warm day so I wouldn't recommend visiting in the summer. The rooms would be miserable and there's much to look at and read."

This treasure is a combination of an outdoor sculpture garden with some of Rodin's better known works -- The Burghers of Calais, The Thinker, The Gates of Hell, and a sculpture of the French writer Honore de Balzac. An indoor museum in the Hotel Biron on the property, where Rodin lived at one time, showcases smaller models of The Kiss and The Thinker, as well as a full-sized John the Baptist, a model of John the Baptist's head and a sculpture called The Age of Bronze, a sculpture so lifelike that Rodin was initially accused of creating it from a life cast of the body of his model. Eventually he proved that this wasn't true, but the publicity helped to make him famous and brought him the commission for creating the bronze Gates of Hell. There is a small restaurant onsite and a lovely pond and green space on 3 hectares at the rear of the Hotel Biron museum. Renovations are ongoing at Hotel Biron, so some exhibits, i.e. The Kiss, etc., have been moved to a space inside the chapel on the property where the entrance, ticket desk, and museum store are located. Well-worth an afternoon visit for all lovers of Rodin!"

The statues of the Burghers of Calais, the Walking Man, Balzac and the Gates of Hell to name but a few are inspirational. The manicured lawn and tree lines within the gardens are most tranquil. The house is beautifully proportioned housing more works of art and sculptures. One of the best visits in Paris."

A visit to Paris happened in July and we visited the museum. The museum is in his old house and contains all his pieces. \"The Thinker\", his famous piece is in several places including a large sculpture in the garden. There is separate admission to the garden and is very much worth it. There are many sculptures here too and you could easily spend an hour walking through the garden. You can also read about how cleverly he negotiated with the government to house his museum at the hotel where he lived. Overall, a nice morning outing. The day we visited there was some sort of memorial day and some troops were marching on the street. It was delightful to watch it over cold beer."

Rodin lived here for a while and when the home went into foreclosure, offerred his artwork to the city of Paris to display to save the house. His artwork is full of personal thoughts about his wife, his mistress (one of the statues has them pulling him in different directions) and his thoughts about the world around him. Although going through some reconstructions, we found most of his works there. The Thinker is in the entry garden (outside) but we could not find \"The Kiss\" until we went to the L'Orangerie - it's near the entrance overlooking Condorde. The gardens are just as beautiful as the artwork inside and out. We attended on the first Sunday of the month (when it was free) and got there early with no crowds! I highly recommend that you read about Rodin and his artwork (I used Rick Steves guidebooks) before you visit - it was much more enjoyable having that knowledge when viewing the artwork."

Sculptures are set within the garden, which is quintessentially French with boxed hedges, pebbled footpaths and fountains, and the artist's former home, which has been stripped back to its bones to give a rustic chic feel.There is a small cafe on site and space in the garden to relax if you are not in a rush.

Now in Aug. 2013 there was a display of gorgeous marbles I hadn't seen before, not sure if that's permanent or not. While I recommend seeing the inside of the hotel/ex-residence of the great artist, where there are many of his plans, hand drawings, and works of his lover and notable artist herself Claudine Claudell, I'd say the greatest bargain in all of Paris is just taking the garden tour. For the really bargain conscious, for one euro you see a collection of simply marvelous bronze statues, The Kiss, The Thinker, the Gates of Hell, all tastefully scattered around an idyllic garden setting. There is a rest area in the back where I spent a peaceful hour in chairs provided. It is simply wonderful, art, history lesson, place to relax during your busy Paris traveling. A pleasant and reasonably priced outdoor cafe also. I quite agree with previous reviewer, absolutely not to be missed!!"

Unfortunately, the gardens were under construction so many of the usual pieces had been shipped to other museums until the work was done. The gardens, however were in full bloom and \"The Thinker\" was seated surrounded by green bushes and roses. This museum is not real handicap friendly, although a discount on the admission is given. The grounds themselves are gravel or packed dirt and even that was difficult to maneuver over. Overall I was a bit disappointed because of the lack of Rodin's works."

The museum is under renovations and my experience this time was not the same experience as three years ago in 2010. Much of Rodin's work that was, and I believe is usually on display, was not. It was a bad copy of what the museum was and will hopefully be when renovations are done. Thant being said - it is still a great museum to see the works of one the (the best in my opinion) greatest sculptors. The museum was his house and workshop for the latter part of his life and there is a wall outside, in the gardens, documenting his life and that of the building.Seeing the house and walking the gardens can be done in an hour, 1 1/2 at most. Since most of the rooms and windows were shut the house was hot. Very hot - but, Paris was going through a mini-heat wave when I was there so that's that. Just something to keep in mind if it's a hot day when you visit.What I like the best about the museum is the ability to get real close to the work and see all the chisel marks, where Rodin formed things with his hands. There is a real human element to the museum if you let it come to you and if you are open to receive it. Of course, I am biased as I prefer sculpture over paintings, and Rodin is my favorite. In any event, no matter what you think of the museum itself, the gardens are worth a nice walk and in 2010 I brought some wine and cheese and meat and made a little picnic near the fountain. Not sure you want to carry around wine all day? No problem. There is a great little cafe in the gardens where you can purchase beer, wine, ice cream, sandwiches, salads, etc., to be enjoyed in a lovely shaded area for a break from the day.The Eiffel tower is a 15 minute walk away to the West, and the d'Orsay is about 12 minutes to the north. That's a nice day I think. d'Orsay, Rodin, Eiffel. Very relaxing and very french."

Once inside the museum you have a garden that is like a little piece of paradise - a place where you can escape Paris and relax. The sculptures are fantastic and you are transported not only through a space filled with great art, but an experience of how that art came about, the process that Rodin went through. The garden on a hot summer's day is a pleasure to walk through and displays the works of Rodin (and other sculpturers) in a most glorious setting. Make sure you allow adequate time to absorb the beauty of the art and gardens as this is the place that will make you fall in love with Paris. The museum is part of the Paris Museum Pass system, although when we went it was not that busy and the bypass the queue system did not provide significant advantages is time saving."

Simple but prominently posted signs would greatly help especially foreign visitors.Once there, I found the museum space cramped. So many pieces of work jostling for space. The lighting was harshfor marble sculptors. Visitors need room to step back and contemplate sometimes but you can't, you'll bump into another visitor's personal space.At the outdoors garden, visitors were jostling for their turns to pose under \"The Thinker\" They all mimic the same pose as \"The Thinker\". In some way it was amusing but I also cringe at the thought that they were posing on Rodin's tomb. How disrespectful!"

There is a small cafe that has healthy choices and a nice area to site outside. The bathrooms are CLEAN and there is no additional charge :) Now o to the sculpture: The Thinker, Balzac, The Burghers of Calais, Masterpieces AND history. Only ONE Euro to see the gardens. A very comfortable relaxed atmosphere combined with some of the most spectacular art in the world makes for a 5 star review."

The history of the Biron, the life of Rodin, and his work both indoors and the walk in the garden of his sculptures is breathtaking. Unlike perhaps the larger museums in Paris, the Rodin Museum is the right size to absorb the prolific works of art Rodin accomplished."

With such a lovely building and gardens, we were a little disappointed at the lack of work really. Many pieces were contained within an apparently temporary exhibition (including The Kiss), which meant that once in the house itself, there was surprisingly little to see...The Gates of Hell was certainly worth the visit, as I love it, and the thing that the museum did make me realise, was quite how much of his work has been reused and recreated for it...seems if an idea worked, he kept with it.Lovely to stroll through the gardens too, and take in the pieces spread throughout, but did make me think it was style over substance sadly, as this doesn't reflect the artist in my opinion (Would have said 3/5 but The Gates of Hell makes it 4/5)"

It's a great place to wander on a hot day, as there are lots of cool shaded areas to sit and contemplate Rodin's genius. It's too bad most people seemed to care only about having their photo taken with \"The Thinker\".The entrance price was very reasonable, and there was the added bonus of a traveling show of Rodin's larger marble sculptures during my visit.I ate lunch at the cafe, which was very tasty and a far better value than eating anywhere else. The whole place was so tranquil that it was a pleasure to enjoy my sandwich and sip my coffee in such peace."

Beautifully manicured rose gardens surround the outdoor sculptures. It is here that you are greeted by the most famous sculpture,The Thinker, which sits upon a pedestal watching over the garden. Most people do not know what the Thinker is gazing upon. The famous Gates of Hell, as well as other less well-known sculptures, also grace the garden area. Inside the mansion, Rodin's sketches and paintings are equally as mesmerizing as his sculptures. Don't leave Paris without spending time here."

The gardens are a delight and the bronzes in the garden are beautifully surrounded by trees/shrubs. The \"Thinker\" was beautifully displayed by its location and surrounding greenery. THe exhibit was actually in 2 buildings. One had mostly marbles and plaster preps. THe gardens had the big ronses and a swecond house for the paintings and small bronses. THe size is perfect for a morning museum visit."

During the course of escorting first-time Paris visitors around key sites, we have been really disappointed at how badly neglected many of these sites are. It is really unforgivable on the part of the responsible authorities. It is not as if they don't make enough off tourists and visitors to cry poor! They earn billions from entry fees charged.Mus\u00e9e Rodin is yet another example of a national monument seriously neglected. The actual main building really needs a good spruce up: paintwork is in terrible condition generally and the plastering in places has come away and there are major cracks indicating separation in the structure. The parquet floors also need attention. While the actual experience of Rodin and his sculptures, drawings and paintings is still great (the sculptures are amazing to see in the different settings, especially the rose garden and forest settings) it shows a serious lack of respect to his talent and major donations to French cultural heritage that all is so poorly presented."

The indoor sculptures are all crowded into a new, modern building, one on top of the other. No way to get any distance on them.

Children ran freely through the grounds exploring the statues and playing hide and seek.The most exquisite piece of work is 'The Kiss', it sends shivers through my spine each time I see it, for me it is innocence beauty and love. Of course there are many more incredible works including 'The Gates of Hell and probably the best known 'The Thinker'"

The Musee Rodin is a special place...the works of Auguste Rodin and others situated in and around the house and the gardens where he lived are truly amazing. As you stand before The Gates of Hell (inspired by Dante's Inferno) you are in awe of Rodin's ability to create such a work of art. Along with the Gates of Hell, The Trois Ombres, The Thinker, the Creation of Adam and my favorite The Kiss are some of the true treasures in the art world. A unique aspect of the garden area where the Gates of Hell is located is the sound of wind moving through the trees which is a recording made specifcally for the site. And one of the roses in the garden had the most fantastic aroma I ever experienced. The Musee Rodin is one of my favorite museums in Paris."

When you book a place like this you don't want a random stage set up in the garden. We also had some issues with the staff, they refused to let the bride inside, causing all of the guests to see her before the big reveal, I finally had to just shove past the guards with her to get her inside so she could use the restroom. The rest of the grounds were beautiful, but when you pay $4000+ to stand in a garden, you don't want rude staff members making you wait outside after the time you were told to arrive and you don't want a garish modern outbuilding constructed in a 19th century hotel and garden."

The style is fantastic and I although I am not a huge art geek, I prefer sculpture to paintings. The featured exhibit was The Flesh, The Marble and I was very impressed. Although it is a small museum and exhibit, you really get to appreciate the artwork more because you are not overwhelmed. 'The Kiss' was there and it was definitely my favorite. I kept coming back to it. The gardens were beautiful and the only downside was that they were setting up the grounds for an event and you couldn't get a night picture of the back of the museum. If you are in Paris for a short amount of time, I suggest visiting Musee Rodin on a sunny day. And if you are in Paris for a longer period of time, then there's no reason why you should miss it!"

Rodin himself agreed to leave all his pieces for free in exchange of a museum being built for him.Most of the pieces are sculptures which is what Rodin is known for.

Even though they are working on part of the big house (which means certain pieces are not available for viewing - including my favorite \"the kiss\") this place is still the best.It is perfect because there are masterpieces in the garden (Thinker, Gates of Hell, and more), and the house. Because of the renovations, there was an extra exhibit set up which showed a lot of model pieces and you could see the evolution of the sculpture.Love this place."

Venice and Florence too much to see, but saw all we could in the time. Never stopped for a minute. Highly recommended holiday."

Having said that, however, this museum is still a must see. This special exhibit of his works in marble was enough to satisfy. And the story of his time in the house gives a special context to his life (and success!) But the real surprise was the outstanding sculpture garden. We did not expect this oasis and deeply regretted not bringing our lunches to picnic, particularly since we had just wasted a bunch of time and euros at an overpriced bistro en route from the d\u2019 Orsay to the Rodin museum. I highly recommend that you use part of this visit for peaceful repose and relaxation and a wonderful setting."

The sculptures are well positioned in the house as well as in the lovely gardens. When I visited this year on our way out we came upon what I hope is a permanent exhibit of sculpture showing the process, with works at different stages. Unfortunately we arrived just about 30 minutes before closing - we could have easily passed another hour. The space is magical -rows of white sculptures in a greyish/blue room. Everyone wandering around seemed to be similarly enchanted."

The main house is 'authentic' in both senses of the word: on the one hand it is very refreshing not to be in a tight design place, on the other it really needs restauration (which will take place between now and 2014)."

You have probably seen the \"Thinker\" dozens of times in photographs, posters and cartoons; but if you get the chance go and see it at the Rodin Museum in its garden setting and photograph it yourself with or without pigeons. In three dimensions it is a revelation of the complexity of the human figure; but it is only one of a host of beautiful bronzes that walk the gardens of the Museum and culminate with the equally famous \"Burghers of Calais\" and many others that are less well known but equally strong characterisations of humanity in all its forms. After walking past a larger-than-life Balzac, you want to go and read his stories and find the strength that you see in metal reproduced in literature. There is an indoor portion of the museum, but it is the outside gardens that are a revelation. There is a caf\u00e9 in the grounds which is good for enjoying a coffee or a sandwich, and watch the many children visiting the museum reaching out to touch the solid brass figures, to hold one of those gigantic hands or to run a finger along the contour of a muscle. The tactile nature of the work is palpable to all."

I imagine in full bloom it is hard to beat. To be able to get so up and personal with his work was amazing. You can look right in the faces of the life-like anquished sculptures, you can knock on the gates of hell and ponder alongside the thinker. Inside the Rodin I found it interesting to see the molds showing how the life takes shape. You can practically feel the mad sweeps of plaster the were living in mind only and needed to be put in form before the thought was lost. We had the museum pass and were able to fit this, d'Orsay and de l'Orangerie in the same day. However, we did spend an evening in d'Orsay by itself because it is a bigger museum with lots to see and take in."

A great picture is to be had with The Thinker in the foreground, flanked by Eiffel's Tower and the golden dome over Napoleon's tomb. The viewing area for the Gates of Hell, with the Three Shades opposite, was well thought out and very aesthetic.A good visit, and depending on your appreciation one can spend 30 minutes or 4 hours on the grounds!"

Not sure when it will re-open. Our favorite part is the garden anyway, and since we were traveling with our 6 year old granddaughter, she enjoyed being outside. This year it wasn't as warm as in previous years, so the roses weren't blooming, but we still loved walking in the garden. For those who don't realize it, one can walk in the garden without going inside for a mere 1 Euro. It's an amazing museum, with a lovely garden, that we return to each time we go to Paris."

Rodin's sculptures strategically placed to both highlight and co-exist with nature. The maison itself is the main museum and walking up the grand staircase, one can't help wonder who had trodden the same stairs before and after Rodin lived there. Rodin's art is infectious and his works show his genius and artistic evolution whether its painting or sculpting with a variety of materials.

The garden is so well laid out and perfect for enjoying the sculptures. It's hard not to be inspired as you stroll the grounds.One of my favorite aspects of this museum is how they have displayed the sculptures in relation to the surroundings. For example, if you stand in the right spot, you can get a great photo of The Three Shades with the Eiffel Tower in the background. The Thinker is positioned perfectly with Les Invalides over his shoulder. Here's a tip, for only 1 euro, you can get access to the garden only. It's a perfect spot to stroll on a nice day. Plan to eat lunch or get coffee at the cafe, then stroll the grounds. The main house is seeing at least once, but probably not necessary for subsequent trips."

I get the feeling Rodin was in love with her when he sculpted this one. The building itself was Rodin's home, so we know he was a very successful artist. The beautiful gardens surrounding the home are worth a look too, since some of his most famous works are located there. The museum is a little out of the way, but it's worth the bit of searching it takes to find it. You won't be disappointed. Also, buy a museum pass here that gets you into the other museums in Paris and avoid standing in long lines elsewhere, especially at The Louvre."

My husband and I took the most gorgeous picture of our whole trip here... in front of \"The Thinker\" in the gardens, with Les Invalides on the left, the Eiffel Tower on the right, and the thinker right behind us. Its such a nice, calm museum, we really enjoyed it and are glad we went.Just make sure you check out the hours of operation (as with everything in Paris) because I believe its only open on the weekends in the afternoon."

I disagree with some people's complaints about the house being a bit run down and that it takes away from the attraction. The creaking floor and peeling paint added to the character and appreciating the age of the structure and therefore the era. Sometimes viewing pristine palaces behind a velvet rope just seems so unreal. To see \"The Kiss\" up close is just beautiful. A bit of a warning though, they are moving things around, I guess. When we were there the entire back garden was tore up and they were building a pavilion type structure. This might disappoint some. Also, I agree with the other reviewer that many of the sculptures are all together in the gift shop area...so really not prime time to experience if that kind of stuff bothers you."

I love coming here, but bare in mind for those who visit this museum in winter, it might not be as pleasant as if you would have gone during summer or fall. First of all, it is chilly and sometimes windy during winter in Paris. When you see the garden, it is very plain and simple. It's not as attractive to look at compare to when there are flowers in the garden and when the fountain is working. Also, it does rain sometimes during winter so to visit the garden can be a little slushy. The temporary exhibition is remarkable, I wish there were more and only if we can take pictures....The museum needs major renovation. It looks good from the outside but inside is a different story. The floors are uneven (on some hallways), the windows needed to be cleaned or changed because it looks so outdated. The lighting is very poor, with my flash on, I sometimes still don't get a good picture.Overall, it's a nice museum despite the major renovations that needed to be done, I like the artifacts in display. The bookstore has a lot to offer, from notepads, school supplies and books, you are likely to leave with at least a souvenir from this museum."

I began every morning and even ended some of my days in the gardens. I walked spellbound around the sculptures and wound through the rooms in perfect contentment. Rodin's work is some of my favorite, and this place is up there as well."

We really wanted to see the Thinker and the Gates of Hell and we weren't disappointed with these but that's just about it. I understand that they are showcasing just one artist but it's quite disappointing the way it's laid out. It wasn't a great day weater wise when we were there which took away from viewing the Thinker and Gates of Hell which along with other sculptures are displayed throughout the garden. The marble pieces including the kiss are displayed indoors and are magnificient, it's a pity they don't allow non flash photos, overall we were sorry we choose this museem over many others to finish our holiday, okay for a visit if your a Rodin lover, cost 18Euro for two which I thought was pricey for what little you got"

The various rooms and staircase gives you a glimpse at what the Parisian gentry'life could be in the mid-XVIIIth...Icing on the cake, the garden has been maintained almost in its original size, something pretty rare in Paris, allowing you to have stunning views on nearby D\u00f4me des Invalides and to rest, far from the city's buzz.The collection itself is just wonderfull with the bronze casts of all Rodin's majour masterworks (Bourgeois de Calais, Porte de l'Enfer etc), many marble masterpieces and gips from the master. A must see for any art lover and a milestone for scuplture history...If you loved it, go on and take a ride to Meudon, a close suburb distant by only 7 km that allows you to visit Rodin's atelier, last house were he spent his last years from 1895 to 1917 (a mooving dining room where he once had supper with Stefan Zweig, Emile Verhaeren, Clemenceau etc) as well as a 1930 pavillon that houses most gips statues he gave to the French state upon his death. are especially mooving his evolving projects for Victor Hugo's funeral monument, as well as the gigantic \"La Defense de Paris\" assessed as too revolutionary by the committee which opted for a more conventional sculpture that can still be seen in Paris business La D\u00e9fense area."

The gardens are only 1 euro to access, if you don't want to go on sculpture overload, and wandering among the trees and flowers is pure stress release. You can find most of the \"big name\" Rodin sculptures in the garden: Le Penseur, Les Trois Ombres, Balzac, Ugolin, and La Porte de l'Enfer. There are benches throughout the garden to sit and rest or reflect. A cafe in the garden provides a chance to enjoy a coffee or snack (or even lunch). When I visited in October, the Hotel Biron (the main house on the property) was undergoing renovation but it is worth the visit, as well, for the opportunity to see many of Rodin's smaller works and studies as well as a number of works by his mistress, Camille Claudel. Also, the gift shop, though small, is wonderful with plenty of trinkets, books, art, and so on that you'll want to take home. I know I have to watch my spending!"

The inside of the museum would be even lovelier if there were rooms \"staged to reflect Rodin's living.\" The star of the museum is, of course, the gardens! And they are breath taking! Even in the dead of winter it is worth visiting this wonderful museum!"

This is the type of museum where it is best to sit, reflect, and relax. The day I visited was the first \"blue sky\" day I had in Paris, and while it was winter-time, it was enjoyable to sit and gaze upon the amazing sculptures in the garden. The interior exhibition is also good, but the garden bronzes are the highlight. I can only imagine the gardens in spring, when it is in full bloom, and must be incredibly picturesque. If you have the time for a leisurely stroll around these masterpieces on a good weather day, then do take advantage of visiting this museum. No guide is necessary. It is easy enough to do on your own."

That alone is worth the price of admission (bought ahead of time online, of course). The house does not have a lot of pieces to view, but what is there is very nice. The gate to Hell is also on display, where The Thinker first made an appearance. Overall it is worth it to see this important piece of art."

In fact when we return to Paris, which we will do sometime in the future, we will again visit Rodin, and this time we will use their audio.The gardens with the statues about is unbelievable. Earlier in the day we had seen several Rodin works at the d'Orsay --which is also NOT TO BE MISSED!!!!!!-- but here at the Gardens they were at an entirely different level.Friends had told us about seeing the \"Thinker\" in the garden setting with the Eifel Tower in the background, however viewing it in person and seeing his \"Dante's Door\" and several other pieces were AMAZING!DO GO THERE!!!!

A walk though the musee Rodin is worth the time. Just through the entrance you are introduced to some amazing works of art. Continue into the garden and visit the thinker, the gates of hell and many others. The garden itself is lovely. I visited in November and still found the garden to be full of beautiful flowers. The thinker surrounded by rows of roses. Before you leave enter a house on the premises. As much as I enjoyed the works of art in the home, there was also a lot of beauty and history in the home itself. Inside you will enjoy art not only by Rodin but also by friends and other artists of his time. As much as I enjoyed the Musee Rodin I believe that it would be worth going to see it in spring and summer. One thing I will say that I didn't like about this museum is it is repetitive. You will find that you are looking at the same sculptures in different sizes some in stone some in bronze, etc. Covered by the MUSEUM PASS!"

If you only think of The Thinker when you think of Rodin, you are in for a treat. Check out the Gates of Hell and my personal favorite The Trois Ombres. You will also find works done by Rodin's mistress who was herself an amazing sculptor."

We rode the hop on hop off bus, and it dropped us off approximately two blocks from the museum. The admission price is very fair, but the cost of the audio tour was equal if not more than the admission itself. We visited during a rain spell and decided to start outside during a break in the weather. The outside sculptures were my favorite part of the entire museum. Beautiful in the dead of \"winter,\" so I can only imagine what it would be like with the trees in bloom and the gardens. If the weather is not perfect or it rained recently make sure you have practical shoes as there are no sidewalks or proper walkways outside. The grounds are gravel/sandstone and after a rain are nothing but puddles and mud. The gates of hell and the thinker are outside and you cannot visit here and not see these sculptures. The emotion, detail and size of his work is breath taking. There are two seperate buildings that house smaller scale sculptures in various materials, paintings, models, etc. Overall well worth the visit. Two to three hours would be sufficient to get a good sense of the entire museum. Wear your wellies or rubbers if the weather is bad so you don't miss the out doors."

Maybe the warmth and serenity of this museum is due to the fact that the estate was once home to the artist, Rodin. His art is still home and in the nurturing atmosphere that created them; and something about that makes me pause and examine the statues here in a little bit more intimacy. Needless to say, I love this museum which is well maintained in both Rodin\u2019s house and in his garden. The ultimate star of the museum is the Thinker, who sits in perpetual contemplation inside his very own grove of conical hedges. If he were to break his concentration, he might notice that over his right shoulder is the sparkling golden dome that shelters Napoleon\u2019s tomb; and over his left shoulder is the Eiffel Tower\u2014frivolous and airy, in contrast to the serious heaviness of the Thinker. This spot is perhaps the best photo-op in Paris because it has so many trademark elements of the city: high art, iconic landmarks, and harmonious contradictions. You might want to extend your time in the gardens by taking a break at the small cafeteria inside the garden walls, where you can find relatively inexpensive sandwiches, salads, croissants and hot coffee.As enchanting as the gardens are, be sure to also enter the house to see some shockingly beautiful and raw statues. Rodin\u2019s style is very raw\u2014which may be one of the reasons I love it so much. His subjects are often in as state of intensity, where emotions are impossible to restrain\u2014a style most exquisitely exemplified in The Kiss.TIP: The Rodin Museum is between the D\u2019Orsay Museum and Invalides. The best way to find it, though, without getting lose is to head straight to the Invalides, which houses the Military Museum (notice the cannons lining the front of the building\u2019s vast lawn. Go to your left when facing Invalides, to its side street (Blvd des Invalides), as if heading towards the huge golden dome of Eglise du Dome where Napoleon is entombed. Roughly halfway down the street, turn left onto Rue de Varenne."

This place was fantastic, it appeared to be under a bit of construction, I wish I could have attended prior to or after the construction rather than during. His sculptures were amazing and the story of his life is fascinating. One morsel I found very interesting was that he sculpted the female anatomy quite a bit although only one piece that I can recall was on display at the museum. I would highly recommend getting the audio guide."

The museum is comprised of a modern, more recent building, and the structure and grounds of Hotel Biron where Rodin lived for many years. Castings of his sculptures are arranged around the grounds (The Thinker, The Kiss, The Gates of Hell, The Burger of Calais...) and the grounds and gardens are a treat in themselves. At the time of his life (and death) the Hotel was on the outskirts of Paris, and it is easy to imagine its semi-rural setting during a visit. Since many of the works are out-of-doors plan your visit with weather in mind."

We visited on a lovely Autumn day, so seeing the large sculpture of the Thinker standing out against a cobalt sky, with the golden dome of Les Invalides just behind it was amazing! The gardens are lovely, so well kept, and full of statues... you just want to live there yourself and go for romantic walks up and down the avenues! The inside of the Hotel (main part of the museum) has fascinating displays with several plaster casts of famous sculptures, showing how Rodin's ideas developed, up to the final product.I have been a Rodin fan since I was a child, and he still grows on me! Interesting to see some works by his mistress, too, clearly inspired by him. Great shop at the end for buying souvenirs or little presents!"

Like Dali's Museum in Montmartre, this little treasure is dedicated solely to the wonderful art and in particular the sculptures of one man, Auguste Rodin. I have visited Paris on 4 previous occasions and this place was either closed or I couldn't find it. Don't make the same mistake! This museum is among my favourites because it concentrates on the life of one famous artist, his home, his life and his magnificent works. Many of his masterpieces are still there including ''The Thinker'' & ''The Lovers''. There are beautiful sketches and finished artworks plus beautifully manicured gardens to set off his more oversized pieces. Many of his works are also on display at the D'\u00d3rsay but there are just enough pieces still here, beautifully displayed without the usual overkill and overcrowding that are the blight of the Louvre and the D'Orsay Museums. Thank goodness for that, as I really enjoyed the relative anonimity of this little attraction. Maybe It was just a quiet day but I really enjoyed the experience. Put it on your list."

We wandered around for about and hour relaxing and taking pictures. A large sculpture of The Thinker is in the center of one of the gardens. There were numerous benches spread throughout the garden that you could sit at, and there was also a little cafe outside. You are also able to go inside Rodin's house, that is now museum. It contains more works by Rodin, as well as works by Rodin's friends. The museum is much smaller that the Louvri and D'Orsay, but it is lovely to walk around and small enough that you don't need to dedicate an entire day."

The building near the entrance is filled with white marble sculptures that are just beautiful and the building in the garden is a gorgeous old building- beautifully decorated, with big windows looking out over the garden. If you're in Paris and you find yourself in a patch of pretty weather, head to this museum. It's maybe a 15-20 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. You won't be disappointed."

Don't know if there was something going on or was usual. Museum is lovely, used to be a place of nun education until the govt decided these places had to be dismantled; the nuns moved out and Rodin and other artists rented rooms there, and Rodin lobbied to have the mansion house his collection. They finally did in 1919 I think though after the death of Rodin. Nice clean toilets, a change for Paris ! Charming little cafe inside the grounds. And very nice sculpture collection even if you are not a big fan fan of Rodin per se.

I was not too impressed with each museum I saw in Paris,but Musee Rodin was really worth visiting.I am not too much into art,but I like good sculpture.Well,Rodin was great master of his job.Some of the sculptures are really breath taking,and museum garden is beautiful.There were exhibition of Croatian sculptor Ivan Mestrovic during our visit,and it was a bonus to our experience.There is some restaurant in museum garden where you can take a rest,drink or eat something,and I sincerely recommend this museum to everybody."

You can pay for the Museum and the Gardens or separate, but I reccomend both. Also, audio tours are completely worth it in all the Paris Museums. My favorite sculpture \"the kiss\". I would have bought a smaller version in the gift shop, but I found them to be on the pricy side. So, if you are into sculptures; this is your Museum!"

While Musee Rodin does boast a great selection of the artist's works, not to mention paintings by Munch, Van Gogh, Singer Sargent and others, the gardens are by far the star attraction. For only \u20ac1 you can wander about and see his most famous works - The Gates of Hell and The Thinker - set amongst rose buses and manicured lawns. The Museum is also fantastic, but with so many other Museums in Paris the garden makes for a welcome break. It has great views of the Eiffel Tower also!"

When you reach the end of the garden and walk through the arch opposite the pond, there is a tranquil place with wooden loungers, benches where you can spot locals reading and resting (you can enter just the garden only for a symbolic fee of 1 Euro). It is a lovely place to get some rest and enjoy nature in the heart of the city. At the moment the part of the garden behing the museum is closed for refurbishment until 2014. Apart from this we enjoyed the visit and plan to come back again when the works on the garden are finished. There is a very nice cafe where we had lunch. Come around 2pm, it is less busy, it gets busier later again. They offer nice salads, hot dishes (pasta, quiches) and delicious pastries. Food is very tasty and reasonably priced."

My first visit to the Rodin was more than 10 years ago, and the layout of the museum with sculptures placed not only in the house but amongst the garden and landscape really gave me a new appreciation for this type of art. My return last May exceeded all expectations. The roses were in full bloom and amazing. The house now features two floors of artwork. The interweaving of the house and gardens and scultpures is still the most grand museum experience for all the sensory levels, from smelling the flowers, seeing the beauty, hearing the outdoors ... Displayed in this manner, the artwork is very accessible and \"real\" even to those who are not necessarily museum devotees. The Rodin is a \"must visit\" on a trip to Paris."

Have visited here multiple times as the lovely garden setting for these amazing sculpures is uniquely charming (great photo opportunities!!) - allowing you to look at the works from every angle imaginable. Also the comprehensive collection of his work inside the house is excellent.I personally enjoy going back to these 'smaller' museums -- you can get much more 'up close' for longer....and able to see 'everything' (foregoing the 'frustration' of 'missing out')!Great for all age groups!"

It was very interesting to see how they worked the various materials. Also, liked to see the artwork that was not Rodin's."

And what a treat was in store!Having done the \"cultural thing\" in Versailles, Monte Martre and a cycle through much of central Paris, this museum was definitely the highlight. Three kids (11,8 and 4) loved the statues, racing around the gardens, posing as the Thinker, etc. and then having a cold drink in the wonderfully appointed cafe.Also, although we went in the middle of August, there was no queue and the indoor activities were equally fun."

The Musee Rodin hasn't changed much over the past years except for the construction of a new (new to us) visitors center and entrance to the hotel housing Rodin's sculptures and collection. It used to be that one walked through the large gates into the courtyard where you began to immediately enjoy the grounds and sculpture gardens. Now, there is security for this national treasure. A must for the times. But, nevertheless, an unfortunate way to begin one's visit.This is one of our favorite museums in Paris, and we were fortunate to spend a warm, summer afternoon in the collections and gardens. The sculpture garden hasn't changed over the years, but the display of marble statues and collections have undergone reorganization. The hotel soon will begin a renovation, and it is expected to last only a year before it reopens in 2013. We'll be interested to see how they reorganize the hotel displays.If you plan to spend several days in Paris and visit both Parisian monuments and museums, purchasing the Paris Musee card is the only way to go. Coupled with the Paris Visite card for Metro, Bus, RER, and SNCF travel in zones 1-3, it saves time and Euros. Sometimes, a package deal is available at the Information booths at airports and Gares."

The beautifully maintained garden was the perfect setting for Rodin's magnificent sculptures. At first, I was a little surprised that there weren't more sculptures outside, but after walking around and really taking it all in, I realized that if there were more, the photo- snapping crowds (me included) would make this experience so much less enjoyable. The spacing between the artwork outside really gives you room to enjoy and appreciate each piece, without them all blending together. I enjoyed the mansion too, but the garden was really something special. With the Museum Pass, we didn't have to wait in the line that had formed along the sidewalk outside."

To effectively do this, we got the map, sat down and planned it. Musee Rodin is not far from Musee De L'Armee and though we weren't planning to go there we thought we might as well. It definately was not a disapointment, the interior areas of the museum was quite crowded but the grounds themselves were far less and more spacious. I prefer the outdoors anyway so this was perfect for us, there is a nice little cafe that is expensive but on par for Paris and we ate lunch on the lawn, it was really laidback and relaxing. The sculptures were really interesting and there is a lot to look at, I especially enjoyed the park like environment and the outdoor sculptures. I especially liked the fact that we were in and out in under 2 hours, yeah we raced around because we are on a tight schedule but we still managed to eat lunch in this time! Like a lot of things in Paris, if I didn't have the museum pass I probably would not have gone, there are just other places to me that take precedence. However, I do not regret going and if I got another museum pass would go again especially if I was in the neighbourhood. All in all it was a pleasant and good experiance and I am happy we went to Musee Rodin."

And even though they were in the middle of a pretty extensive renovation project and the drizzling rain never let up, it was still an incredible experience.You entire into the first building where you can buy your tickets (or present you Paris Museum Pass). There's also a pretty nice gift shop with an assortment of books, t-shirts, and standard souvenir stuff. From there you move in to the first room with a number of great Rodin sculptures highlighted by \"The Kiss\". After that you make your way outside and to your right \"The Thinker\", Rodin's most popular works, sits surrounded by some beautiful hedges. From there the path takes you through the gardens where some of the artist's bronze casts are strategically placed. There's also a nice little cafe on the grounds. You weave around and come out at the gorgeous pool with a lovely garden facing the Hotel Biron. This was one of the prettiest places in Paris even with the overcast skies. I can only imagine how beautiful it would be under a bright sun. From there you can enter into the garden area that features Rodin's \"The Three Shades\" and \"The Gates of Hell\".You can also go into the Hotel Biron for two floors of more Rodin sculptures. The beautiful staircase and the creaking wooden floors also add to the experience. As I mentioned, the museum is undergoing a big renovation so a lot of the sculptures aren't where they will be once the work is done. But there is still some amazing artwork to see and some glorious and relaxing gardens just waiting to be enjoyed."

Well, that hasn't changed although I was disappointed to discover the museum is undergoing extensive renovations. Luckily they are being smart about it and only fixing one half of Rodin's house at a time. They are using a special exhibit area in the Museum entrance to show some of the statues that you would otherwise miss. So although you won't be seeing the usual number of exhibits, there certainly are plenty of statues on display to make the visit worthwhile. And once you see the state of the house, you'll understand why they had to renovate. There is a very interesting panel in the garden which details in English Rodin's life in the house and his difficulties in turning it into a museum for his work (something that wasn't finally accomplished until after his death). We visited on a Sunday morning and arrived 10 minutes before it opened. There was a line of about 10 people, and we had an easy time buying our tickets (10 Euros for a family--what a great price!) and touring the museum. We stayed a little over two hours and the museum never got crowded. We did not rent the audio and still enjoyed ourselves, but there were minimal explanations on the statues so if you really want to learn about Rodin, I would buy the audio tour.We started with the temporary exhibit. Be sure if you bring a backpack to carry it in front of you (so that you don't accidentally bump it into a statue. If this makes you feel like you're pregnant, you can check your backpack in the main house). Although it's incredibly tempting--don't touch the statues (yes, people did this while we were there and were politely chastised by the museum personnel)--we all want these masterpieces to remain pristine for future generations. You cannot take pictures in the temporary exhibit, but you can in the main house and the gardens (no flash). After the temporary exhibit, we toured the gardens. The restroom in the gardens was closed, so be sure to use the one in the entrance building if you need to. There is a restaurant in the garden with plenty of seating, and although we didn't eat here, it seemed like a great place to sit and enjoy the beauty of the place.After the gardens we toured the half of the main house that was open. One room is dedicated to Camille Claudel, and be sure to notice the paintings on the wall by a variety of artists. The VanGogh portrait was a wonderful surprise and seeing those paintings hanging haphazardly on the walls of an old house instead of a big, modern museum was an odd experience--certainly more intimate.Overall, you'll love your trip to this museum. I highly recommend it for families, even those with young children. They may not notice the sculptures but they will enjoy exploring the gardens.Here are links to my Tout page where you can see 15 second video clips of some of the statues:http://www.tout.com/m/2zr1fdhttp://www.tout.com/m/z8qq64http://www.tout.com/m/rraxhzhttp://www.tout.com/m/uub8vg"

It was incredibly busy as we walked in, but we had a museum pass so we could skip the lines. It was interesting to walk through the actual house with the sculptures inside. That being said, if I did not have the museum pass I would likely not have gone in, the wait outside was not worth the walk through. It was also raining when we went so we could not walk through the gardens which I glimpsed."

You can be up close and personal with many of Rodin's famous works. Even in July at mid-day, it was no oppressively crowded. People were very considerate when taking photos around the sculptures (except one family who clogged the Thinker while taking about 5 minutes to pose their children)I think if I had been more awake on the renovation situation, I would have just done the gardens for 1 euro, but we paid for the house as well (9 euros total). From what I could gather, the museum has pulled a representation of Rodin's most important pieces from the different time periods of his career as well as works of art from some of his friends (a couple of Van Goh paintings and one Monet, etc) and put these on display in a few rooms of the mansion. You walk around on what feels like a temporary floor so there is a lot of noise. I knock a star because the interior rooms get a little tight with people, cameras, bags, etc with these open works of art just there like they could be knocked over (I am sure they are secured, but still) I was surprised that the museum allowed backpacks and large bags. Their only requirement seemed to be that people had to wear their backpacks on the front of their bodies..."

There is also work by his former model, muse, lover and eventual rival Camille Claudel.I was emotionally exhausted by the end of the visit.

Try to get close and really look at everything that's going on on those Gates--the details are fascinating. We enjoyed the audioguides even though these were the most annoying in their detail (always telling you where the artwork was first displayed and then were it was displayed next, etc.). Like most places worth seeing in Paris there was a queue but it wasn't so terribly long and seeing Rodin's work was well worth the wait.

The house and gardens are beautifully presented and a sunny day is the perfect time to visit. If you are not wild about sculptures, you can immerse yourself in the beautiful gardens, and if gardens are not your thing, you can meander from one superb sculpture to another. And that is all before you enter the house to experience a wealth of wonderful works by Rodin and other brilliant artists like Van Gogh, Renoir, Camille Claudel etc The essence of the house and gardens is one of light and colour, something I found really refreshing are the darkness of other interesting sites such as the Musee Jacquemart-Andre and Victor Hugo Museum. I thought it was one of the best value for money museums that I visited in Paris."

Many of his best works are on display, and the garden contains some of his masterpieces, such as the Thinker, the Burghers of Calais, and the Gates of Hell. You can take photos (no flash) both indoors and outside. I think it's one of the best museums in Paris, but then I think Rodin was one of the world's great sculpters. You'll discover that he also worked in other mediums."

There were even pieces by his mistress/girlfriend depicting their relationship, which we found very interesting. The sculpture is beautiful and it is displayed in a way that makes you feel like you are getting a peek at Rodin's life. The gardens are amazingly beautiful and offer a little retreat right in the middle of Paris. There are beautiful flowers, water fountains, and of course, sculptures, all throughout the garden. I could sit there for hours. But, if you are short on time, this is a Museum that you can see and thoroughly enjoy in 1-2 hours. It is included in the Paris Museum Pass and is located right next to Napolean's Tomb. The Varenne metro stop is the closest to the Museum."

How can someone acheive such perfection?If, as Edison said, genius is 10 % inspiration and 90 % perspiration I rate Auguste Rodin at 200 % because I could certainly build the sweat but never the genius. Artists are certainly Humanity's gift to itself...they renew your values of beauty and well being."

The rooms were by date/phase of this life, and even included Van Gogh paintings and other non-Rodin work. I liked the sculpture gardens better than the interiors, though the house itself is quite interesting. I missed the workshop items from my last prior visit - not there any more?: hands and feet - hundreds of these - all kinds of bits and pieces from works in progress. Too bad workshop items are no longer on display"

The house is majestic, old and gorgeous, like only European houses can be. It houses an impressive staircase and has huge windows that let the light shine in on the art. From one room you slide into the other, continued to be amazed by such beauty surrounding you. We didn't take the guided tour, prefer to explore by ourselves. The garden is very well kept, filled with plenty of art (including 'The Thinker'), overgrown walls, sitting chairs and benches and a big pond. We were lucky to have been there on a sunny day. You may use your camera in the museum, so be sure to bring it along, you'll want to shoot. You can't use your flash and some of the works can't be photographed. None the less, i had a field trip with my camera. Pre-booking is a must, especially in season. It gets quite busy!Another plus, located in a great area next to Les Invalides."

The place is usually packed then, and you don\u2019t feel the history around it. I am not exactly an expert on the subject, but I know that this H\u00f4tel particulier was built when there were only fields surrounding it\u2026 That is a first thing that should keep you thinking. Sitting in the gardens is most enjoying, if there aren\u2019t too many people and that the sun is shining. Inside the sculptures are absolutely beautiful. They come at all sorts of stages and of all sorts of material and their set-up is fine ; and the museum is pretty large ! What is wonderful is when you realize how many people are represented here ; what a rich society it must have been ! In some lost corner, for some strange reason, you can see a film of Victor Hugo\u2019s funeral. That is probably one good enough reason to go (the TV set should be inclosed in some trivial looking wooden box)The film Camille Claudel is probably a nice one to view before going. You will then also want to go to the place where she lives, in the movie. In reality, what is supposed to be her front door, leads to some sort of a broom closet. We are here talking about the H\u00f4tel de Beauvais (metro St. Paul- Le Marais ; 68, rue Fran\u00e7ois Miron), almost across from the photography museum where are exhibited pictures from renown people such as Henri Cartier-Bresson.If you are looking for more \u201csmell\u201d of Rodin, you might also be happy to visit his workshop in Meudon (take train at St. Lazare station, I think)"

Musee Rodin is a very cute little museum and just a 5 minute walk from La Musee de l'Armee and Napoleon's tomb, though I was told the original Penseur is in his house in Meudon. My favorite part was the garden surrounding the museum, filled with flowers and sculptures.However, if staying in Paris for only a couple days, I'd say the Musee d'Orsay just about sums up Rodin and frees up time to see other things. If you do decide to visit his house, take note that it is only open Friday, Saturday and Sunday. My friend and I made the mistake of not checking before we made the 40 minute metro ride and a 15 minute hike up a long hill only to find it closed."

The exhibits have been re-arranged in the parts of the building that are still open, and are very intelligently laid out in a way that enables one to learn a lot about Rodin in a short visit. The pleasant gardens contain larger sculptures, but these are poorly labelled, and one really needs to have seen the indoor display first to appreciate them fully. Sadly we did not do this because of the rather poor organisation of the museum. The ticket clerk warned us that there was a 40-minute wait to get into the house, but not that this meant 40 minutes standing in the rain. We decided that if we were going to get wet anyway we might as well do it while we toured the garden, in the (justified) hope that by the time we had done this, and had a cup of tea in the very ordinary museum cafe, the queue would have shortened. Even with renovation works in progress it would not be too difficult to provide shelter for the queue, and/or provide better information. Nonetheless, to see such iconic works as The Thinker, The Kiss and The Gates of Hell at close quarters in a sympathetic environment was well worth a little hassle. But if you can, avoid going when it is raining!"

People who come here love art,and not because they have a list to rush through. So much nicer than the larger museums. Go on the evenings when there are extended hours. Less crowded and the lighting is beautiful."

What I like most about it is that many of these - including the Thinker, and his extraordinary expressionist statue of the novelist Balzac - are found in the beautiful grounds surrounding the main building. And it is worth walking slowly through the grounds, since many little beauties reveal themselves just round an unexpected corner.We have been there several times, and were drawn there this time because of an extraordinary special exhibition devoted to hundreds of the sculptor's preliminary drawings of the female nude. Most were done quickly, mainly with pencil, and the majority had some elements of colour added to at his leisure, without the model. Still others were cut up and reassembled as collages. But it is the basic sketches, done in the heat of the moment which get the blood racing."

The up side of this is that you can visit the gardens for free while this happens and see most of the more famous works such as the Thinker, The Gates of Hell in the grounds and also see some original marble works housed in a small glass fronted building. The gardens themselves were still in their winter hibernation mode so it would be difficult to make any comment about them. The coffee shop though looked very stylish indeed.

It is down a quiet street and doesn't look like much from the outside and you could miss it completely if you weren't paying attention! The reason is because the museum is a house! Rodin's house. There is a lovely yard around the house with sculptures and the inside of the house contains many smaller works. It is less crowded than the other museums and the atmosphere is so peaceful, perfect for enjoying fine art. They have nice cafe by the pond as well. If you are in Paris for more than 3 days and have time to see something other than the big Paris tourist spots, I recommend this pleasant little museum if you have a couple hours to spend."

What I found most fascinating, though, were the displays that show the multi-step process of creating a bronze sculpture, from crude clay model to the final cast.There are also works by Monet, Renoir, Van Gogh, and Camille Claudel.This is not a museum to rush through. Take your time. Be amazed. Wonder at the profusion of works that would be considered shocking by today's standards."

Without the setting of the garden the sculptures would have had less of an impact. It would have been just like the sculptures in the Louvre or in the Bargello. I believe that the spatial design of the gardens with Rodin's sculptures is the tour de force of this musuem. In addition to the sculptures, Rodin was extremely prolific with his drawings, which were on exhibit when we visited, and I found them to be completely enlighting of the man behind the sculptor."

Rodin was about real life and the garden concept in particular is excellent.

The masterpieces are displayed beautifully and with great care and thought as to their surroundings and settings. The \"gates of hell\" was fascinating to examine close up, as was 'The Thinker' and many other pieces. It's not a big place, but well-designed, such that it didn't feel crowded or over-run even though there was quite a crowd out that day. And with the outdoor venue, it feels more relaxed, almost peaceful, where you can take your time and not have to rush to see the next piece.We were there around lunchtime, so took a very pleasant break at the cafe at one of the outdoor tables and enjoyed a lovely lunch and some sun, as well."

We found the Musee Rodin (http://www.musee-rodin.fr/en/) a perfect antidote for that sensation. Opened in 1919 and housed in a exquisite private townhouse, it sits in an enclosed garden that provides a quiet oasis in the midst of the city. The cafe in the garden offers very good food at reasonable rates -- far better on both counts than we experienced at the Musee d'Orsay cafe.I was amazed at how close we could get to the diverse works of Rodin and those of Camille Claudel, his pupil, collaborator, and mistress. My husband and I wanted to document as much of our time in Paris as we could in photos, and were delighted to find that we could use our cameras (no flash) freely in this museum. I look more closely at things when I am working out the best angle and distance from which to photograph them, and enjoyed working within the confines of the space and other visitors.The interior of the building was as fascinating as the artworks -- amazing chandeliers, ornate mirrors, delicately carved trim on door frames, and much more. We spent about three hours here, and left feeling refreshed and inspired. I highly recommend it as a Paris attraction!"

If yougo to Rodin before 1 then you can buy a combined ticket. You can see Rodin and then go to Orsay and enter through the ticket holders line. The line (C) is sometimes smaller than the one for ticket buying at Orsay."

Then take a peak at The Gates of Hell and ponder the Thinker. See some fun video here: http://savvynomad.com/2011/10/the-gates-of-hell/."

We've seen the Musee D'Orsay -- more reasonable size but too crowded. Now we've seen the Rodin Museum -- just the right size! First of all, this museum is really accessible as its right off a Metro stop and blocks from Les Invalides. They monitor how many people are inside so it doesn't get too crowded. They also let you take pictures which is rare in good museums. The sheer size of some other museums make them overwhelming to people, but Musee Rodin is the perfect size to browse.Some of Rodin's most famous pieces are in the gardens and some are in what used to be Hotel Biron. It was so refreshing to see art on a grand scale in an outdoor setting. You can sit on the steps of \"The Thinker\" for a picture in the garden. Stand back and gaze at \"The Gates of Hell.\" Take time to marvel at Paolo and Francesca embracing in \"The Kiss\" inside the mansion. Learn how Rodin and Monet were friends. Really interesting stuff."

So, as soon as I entered, I almost bumped into \"The Thinker\". The garden is a really pleasant place. Inside the house, there are more masterpieces and a special room dedicated to Camille Claudel - which I think was the most special room inside the house.

Seeing his sculptures outside of the usual four walls of a museum also allowed me to appreciate the intense presence his figures emanate. There is also much to see inside of the mansion so do go inside. It is covered by the museum pass.This treasure of a museum also introduced me to The Age of Maturity, sculpted by his former lover, Camille Claudel. It actually moved me to tears, mostly due to the fact that she became increasingly paranoid after their breakup, her glorious career ended and she died in an insane asylum, but also because I am getting older and saying goodbye to youth as well!There is a metro (Varenne stop) and bus stop right in front of the museum on Blvd des Invalides so it's incredibly easy to find. We walked from the Eiffel Tower to the Military Museum (Napoleon's tomb and a cool assortment of armour, weapons, et al) then on to the Rodin, then took the bus back to our apartment near Luxembourg Gardens without getting too tired."

The Burgers of Calais is terrific as a work of art, and so is the Gates of Hell. Balzac is not much to my liking. The work of Camille Claudel is very good. I saw the movie about her many years ago and she was a feminist ahead of her time. I enjoyed the beautiful garden at the back of the museum. The sculptures there were perfect for the place.

The Hotel Biron, which is itself a beautiful and elegant building, is the basis of the museum with the hotel and its gardens both used as a setting for Rodin's famous works, including The Thinker, The Kiss and the Gates of Hell. Being able to see his works in place also allows the sheer mastery and majesty of his sculptural technique to be fully appreciated. Rodin actually used the Hotel Biron as his workshop and so it is a total Rodin environment.Make sure you go on a fine day as this allows you to see the sculptures outside at their very best. The garden itself and the lake are a beautiful setting as well. The other general advantage here is that there is not the usual huge crowd one encounters at the Louvre, for example.Les invalides and the Military Museum are also close by."

I can't add too much as I think the Musee Rodin is one of those museums that most people are either going to go to or not go to, and they probably know this from the beginning. I just wanted to pipe up in favor of the gardens. When I went with my partner, who is an artist, I whiled away some lovely time in the gorgeous gardens while he intensely studied the sculpture. The gardens are manicured and well-maintained, and there are great areas to rest and contemplate from benches by the Gates of Hell to chaise lounges with a wonderful view of the estate. That's not to say that the museum itself isn't worthwhile, especially as the building is so unique and lovely and you can really get a feel for life as an artist in Rodin's time. But if you're traveling in a group and on the fence about going, remember that the museum is much more than the sculptures - and if you're still not convinced, you can purchase a less expensive garden-only ticket which still lets you see some of the most famous pieces such as The Kiss and The Gates of Hell. Musee Rodin wasn't on my list of must-dos, but the wonderful garden made it definitely worth it."

Very closely related.This museum does not seem to appear on \"Top Ten\" lists of Paris attractions but, if such lists ever expanded to 15, I think many would add it.Musee Rodin has a lot to offer but the thing I liked about it the most is it is not overwhelming like the better known and larger musuems of Paris. It does not have the huge crowds filling our their \"checklist\" of museums and monuments and, with a 1.5 or two hour visit, you can feel that you got a fairly thorough look at Rodin. The museum includes Rodin's greatest works and also gives you insight into his evolution as a sculptor, his place in the Impressionist movement, and an understanding of the technical aspects of his work.In addition to the buildings, the gardens, which hold his principal works, are a pleasant place to relax and take a break.NOTES FOR VISITORS:1. Near Napoleans Tomb/Invalides so this can be combined with those attractions. The Musee Rodin, the Musee de l'Armee, and the Eiffel Tower would be a full day.2. Some maps are terrible but the closest metro stop to the entrance is VARENNE.3. Covered by Museum Pass. 4. I have heard you can visit the gardens alone for a Euro or two. While you cannot enter the buildings, this would give you access to \"The Thinker\", \"Burghers of Calais\", \"Victor Hugo\", \"Gates of Hell\", several full sized studies for \"Burghers of Calais\" and other works.5. There is a cafe in the garden.6. If you really want to relax, there are chaises at the southernmost end of the gardens."

The museum in comprised of a house where Rodin lived and the surrounding garden, both filled with his work. The garden and house are quite calm, without the hustle and bustle of the more popular Paris art museums, such as the Louvre.Not only does the garden house some of Rodin's most famous works, such as \"The Thinker\"; it also displays much of the work that went into them. For example, there garden has six full-sized nude studies from \"The Burghers of Calais\". The house contains a massive volume of his sculptures, much of it little-known, that allows one to view both the evolution and scope of the sculptor's work. It also displays a smattering of the work of his students and contemporaries- the museum has several works by Van Gogh and Monet, the latter a close friend of Rodin.One sad fact is of the museum is that, in an attempt to incorporate modern art, the courtyard contains three recent abstract pieces, each resembling a four meter tall chrome plated aluminum turd. Fortunately, this is the entire extent to which such art has permeated the museum- the rest is all that of Rodin and his contemporaries.Overall, the Museum was an unexpected treat, and wonderful experience, and almost as much as an art must-see as the Musee d'Orsay."

It was a tad pricey but having a pain au chocolat and coffee while staring at a few Rodin sculptures makes up for the temporary lightening of the wallet (when the belly is filled and the mind and eyes are enriched than what is money anyway).The house provides a look into the sculptural life of Rodin including his relationship with the (much) younger sculptor, Camille Claudel.

It's certainly smaller than The Louvre or Musee d'Orsay and therefore easier to wrap your mind around in a single visit. I knew next to nothing about Rodin before my stop and left with a whole new appreciation of him and sculpture art in general.Easily found just to the east of Hotel des Invalides, the museum is partly inside an old 18th century mansion and partly spread throughout the surrounding gardens. The museum is laid out in chronological order, starting inside with his early works and moving through the Belgian period, portraits of women, and public monuments to name a few. Larger works (The Kiss, Eve, the Gates of Hell) are given their own room and thorough explanations. The outdoor gardens include many of these figures set against a more natural background. I found the audio guide a great help and thought it added to the experience tremendously. Overall time for the visit was about 3 hours.Highly recommended and one of my top five experiences while in the city."

The house is worth walking round but if money or time is tight then prefer the outdoor wonders and take tea in the pavilion.

This is one of these small and charmy museum that everybody, even people who are not very much into arts, will find pleasant and interesting.Museum is very combact, 2 floors with Augiste Rodin's artwork, and some art work of his mistress Camille Claudel. There are a couple of paintings etc from Rodin's personal collections, or item dedicated to him, but the place make visitor not to feel overloaded with exibits and information. Rodin's style helps a lot to that! I visited end of November, and I noticed there were many French visitors,as well as foreigners. This place was busy, but not too crowded. It houses some temporary collections time to time so it becomes quite popular to Paris art lovers, and it's mentioned in guidebooks, so its fame will keep growning I guess.Now, as other people mentioned, high-light of the museum is its lovely garden, with nice plantation, many statues,a small pont, and many benches to seat down and enjoy. I visited on a not-so-sunny day, and I still spend about 1 h and a half in the garden. There is a cafe/restaurant where hot drinks are served on very low prices. There is a decent collection of food items, but I noticed that these are a bit pricey...Full entrance fee for the museum is 6 euros, a very reasonable fee, especially taking into concideration that most Paris attractions are rediculously expensive. You can buy a 12 euro pass to save a couple of euros if you plan to visit Musee d'Orsay on the same day. Musee Rodin is included in the Paris Museum Pass too. Very good value for money.For people who like to visit many attraction on the same day, please note that Invalides are located close by too."

There are 2 floors in the main building with special exhibits then housed in the building where you get tickets and have a bookstore. Obviously the pieces displayed are magnificant but for the museum itself, I wasn't that impressed. We went on an August afternoon and while not an really hot day, the museum was stifling. No air conditioning or even ventilation in the rooms and with the crowds everywhere , we had less then desirable viewing experience. The gardens are ok but I feel it doesn't deserve the raves of the other reviews. However, my standards may now be skewed by recently visiting the gardens of Versaille and Vaux-le-Vicomte. There are perhaps two dozen statues scattered around with minimal documentation and then only in French. I did like the area at the back of the garden where one can actually sit on the grass - there were even some lounges to use. We did have a great cup of tea and cappuccino in the small cafe located on the grounds.Overall, a fan of Rodin would love this museum but for the average person, I think an average experience."

I think one thing that makes this one good is the way it works with the mansion as an urban garden, although it was originally the private residential garden for Rodin. There are many sculptures throughout the garden - you can see quite a bit of work without entering the museum. This is one of those places where you feel like you've discovered something off the beaten path. A bit low-key compared to the other big gadens & parks, but really well done.It's worth noting that the gardens have a small cafe. You can see a menu on the French version of the museum website : http://www.musee-rodin.fr/accueil.htm > Jardins > Information Practiques > La caf\u00e9t\u00e9ria > menu. Even though you have to go through the French side of the website the menu is in both French & English ! And if you don't go to the cafe you could probably slip in a light lunch & a drink and have a discrete bench picnic - just a suggestion -"

Pick up a complimentary map and guide and stroll outside.Of course \"The Thinker\" is high on everyone's list and it's immediately to your right after exiting the interior. The gardens also offer beautiful views of the Invalides Dome Church and Eiffel Tower. Many of Rodin's works are on display here to be taken in at your own pace. I noted some people on the array of benches that were enjoying the sunshine and sketching, so I took their lead, read for a while, and took a 30 minute snooze to recharge for the rest of the day and evening.Don't miss the \"Gates of Hell.\" either.

The crowds and jet lag hit us about 30 minutes into our visit there so, feeling quite overwhelmed, we quickly finished our self-guided tour and headed to the Musee Rodin gardens. Wow! In our fatigue, this was just what we needed! We grabbed a drink at the snack stand in the gardens and had the most delightful time sitting in the shade and strolling through the gardens. They are so beautiful and such a fun way to see such amazing works of art! Some of my favorite pictures from our trip to Paris were taken in the front of The Thinker with the Eiffel Tower in the background. After an hour or so of enjoying the gardens, we toured the inside of the museum. It was also a treat! The Musee Rodin gardens are a \"must see\" - they are an oasis!

            "review": "An outstanding Museum Experience. On recent trip to Paris, my husband and visited the Rodin Museum and we were both very pleased with the whole experience. The museum is very close to Les Invalides and is easily accessed by Metro. Hotel Biron is a rococo mansion with about sixteen exhibit rooms. Each room has only two or three sculptures so you can enjoy each piece without feeling overwhelmed or over-stimulated. All the larger than life sculptures are carefully situated throughout the beautiful gardens, so you can stroll at your leisure through the grounds as you view Rodin's magnificent works. We rented the audio devices available and found them an excellent way to fill in the blanks of our knowledge of Rodin and his works. Learning the background of each work made the experience that much richer. But best of all, the grounds are so peaceful and idllyic. We were there in early December and the gardens were still lovely, not as beautiful as they would be in spring or summer but still colourful and lovely. I would highly recommend a visit to this museum. Visit the web site and then visit the real thing...you are in for a treat!!!"

Absolutely spectacular. There is also some rooms when you first enter museum of a Japanese artist. I'm really bad at remembering names though so I can't remember who but he had some quite interesting sketches. Rodin sculptures are not to be missed though. They are remarkable."

The building itself is a little worn, with some creaky floors, but the art within is clearly world-class and not to be missed. The location is an easy walk from the Rue Cler area and Napoleon's Tomb."

            "review": "A Hidden Gem. Of all the museums in Paris, this is perhaps the most underrated. The museum is actually housed in Rodin's former house! \"The Thinker\" sits right outside in his sculpture garden! Because most of the pieces are displayed as they were during Rodin's lifetime, this museum offers a much more personal experience than other museums. I can't recommend it enough."

I block out a day to spend there every time I'm in Paris. (This would probably be too much for most people. I'm a little obsessive.) The location is convenient to other \"things to see\", while the gardens are beautiful and serene. You will never know you're in the city once inside the walls. The collection of Rodin's work is amazing and it also houses the majority of the remaining works of Camille Claudel, who was Rodin's apprentice and lover. If you are a fan of sculpture, this is a MUST SEE!"

The statue of \"The Thinker\" is in the garden, so you can do the same pose and get the glorious dome of Les Invalides in the background. The gardens are lovely, and there is an outdoor cafe under dense shade. The gift shop has nice items at good prices, especially lovely postcards of Rodin's sculptures. Don't miss the chandeliers on the second floor, stunning!!!"

It is charming and relaxing and a wonderful way to spend an hour or two. Even if you are not well-versed in Rodin's work, you are bound to recognize some pieces (the thinker, the kiss) and enjoy some others. Definitely a worthwhile stop for anyone who is going to spend more than a day or 2 in Paris!"

I'm not much of a museum buff but this was a very pleasant visit (not least because it's next to the army museum at Les Invalides). The formal gardens (where you will find the thinker) are tranquil. Inside the lovely house you will find the kiss. A nice suprise was the Van Gogh, Monet and Renoir paintings upstairs. Reasonably priced at 5 euros per adult. Under 25's are 3 euros and under 18's are free!"
