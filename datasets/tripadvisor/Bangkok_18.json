Visited Central World Plaza which is located between Siam and Ratchadamri BTS station (please do not mix this station up with Ratchathewi) for the first time this month. From Siam Square area, you can use the sky walk (elevated pedestrian walkway which is a level lower than the BTS station platform) to access Central World Plaza. It is a very big, modern mall with a nice atrium where zig-zagging escalators creating a pattern when looking down from the eatery floor. Supermarket and cinema are found on the same floor where the eateries are. There are Thai, Japanese, Chinese and other restaurants on that almost top floor. We patronized a Thai restaurant here and will review it later. We think there is an Isetan in here when we saw its logo on the facade of the building the following day but we didn't have a chance to walk past it during that evening when we visited it. For those who like pubbing or to listen to some music while eating/drinking, can pop by the Groove, it's on the 2nd level. You can also walk up to the Groove from ground level via flights of outdoor steps. Note that alfresco dining is available@the Groove and we notice there is at least one restaurant which offers both alfresco dining and air-con dining place. For those who like to buy stuff made from Thai silk, there is a <Jim Thompson> on the first level, nearer to the Groove side."

The lower floor has a market type of feel to it with its open stalls down stairs, it has a huge grocery department store, bubble tea shops, banks, clothes etc. I really enjoyed seeing new things and trying out Thai food (stalls give samples) the people were helpful and friendly around.

Just flip the job ads in their newspapers and you see jobs going for 15,000B a month.Then when you arrive at this mall operated by the Central group, you see prices that does not agree with the average Thai people. Crazy.But there are filthy rich Thai people too. And these are the target audience. They will shop for a car on the 5th floor of the mall. Or even pay 3 to 4 times more for a luxurious movie screening.Yes the rich come out to play, despite the traffic jam that surrounds this mega mall.Tourists go for the average option at Chatuchak.Rich tourists come to Central for the big brand names.Your pleasure is dictated by how much you are worth.That is the tragedy that is life."

If you are looking for a bargain on a brand name item you will most likely find it back home in US or Europe for the same price. Or at the airport but they also start to charge same prices as stores at home.Personally I think it's worth a visit since the mall has a nice layout and a lot of shopping, the downside is that with children mine is 10 years old and like to buy everything and also gets tired after the first floor so it's very exhausting to visit here with children."

I've seen Bangkok Motorbike Festival, Manga Festival and Miss International Queen to name a few."

We also did try to watch a movie and indeed they have one of the best cinemas. I believe they have 15 cinemas inside and the seat is spacious and very comfortable.

Over the years it has become more upmarket with very few craft stalls there that was the case a few years ago.Don't forget, everything here is price marked so there's no bartering, but they do have some deals if you buy more than 1 item such as buy 4, pay for 3.I have been coming to Bangkok for 27 years and personally I feel that Central World has lost some of its charm and become just a huge shopping mall, but I still recommend it for a few hours entertainment if it's raining outside."

If you love shopping you would love this Centre. If you hate shopping I would give it a miss as you can walk around this complex all day. Some shops cheaper than Australia others not.

Mostly upscale international brands and the prices you see on Orchard Road or Takashimaya back in Singapore and giant tents outside for events and Bazaar like stores. There is one shop that is much more popular with female travellers and that is NaRaYa on the 1st floor. It's usually swamped with people while the other stores are mostly empty. Small purses and bags go for as low as 50BHT and go up to 500++BHT. If you want to buy gifts for your mother, wife or sister, but don't want to just get one of dubious quality off the street, you'll want to go to NaRaYa as its branded but still costs about the same ore even cheaper!"

Also have Karmakamet and other aromatherapy shops which are quite scattered.Tourists can sign up for One Card that gives discount to the departmental stores and few shops.

Lots to do, eat and see here in Central World."

On the 7th floor within Central World, hidden behind the food hall is Central Food Court. Prices range from 45 baht to130 baht. Very good food, well cooked, well presented and at a most reasonable price. There has to be something for everyone including vegetarian options. Great value, not as trendy as some other food courts as the seating is a bit 'works canteen' but the food is good and the value for money is spot on."

There is everthing you would ever need .........global brands, Department store, boutiques,Pharmacies, jewelery,electronics, beauticians,hairdressers, restaurants ,cafes ,etc. Everything is fixed price and I couldnt find any bargains as everything was the same price or more expensive than back home in Sydney Australia. We enjoyed being connected to the Centre as it was lovely and cool inside when temperatures outside were too high.We also enjoyed walking through the centre at night after dinner.The centre is attached by walkways outside to the rail and other shops."

It was good to have a look around however it was so vast that in the end we got bored and returned to the hotel. Alot of the shops are highly priced and having been used to negotiating at the markets the experience here was completely the opposite.There are market traders located outside the mall, having spent a couple of hours walking around the different floor levels and shops, the market was a welcome sight and back to reasonable prices. Good experience however if you want souvenirs etc stick with the markets."

I liked Isetan which is a Thai branch of a Japanese Department store chain. If you are fond of cute stuff you have to visit their area which showcases food that are popular in Japan. The food designs were so cute that you would want to take photo first before eating. They also have sections for Japan themed restaurants. I was able to buy Sanrio products at discounted prices in Isetan. On the other end is Zen which sells clothes of higher end brands. In between the huge mall you can find various arrays of retail shops. You can also find Naraya Bags at the ground floor which is a big hit to the Chinese tourist. There were long lines in the counter that I decided not to push thru with my purchase. Finding food and restaurants for any race won't be a problem coz they are scattered all over different floors in the upper portion. If one is on the budget they have food court as well as supermarket with plenty of Thai delicacies. After roaming and shopping around Central World I also went to the front outside grounds where they were having two big tents on opposite sides selling foods and clothings as well. I am just not sure if they do this on regular basis but I just felt lucky during that weekend coz I was able to buy clothes at very reasonable price from local designers. And of course there is Big C just across Central World if you want more local stuff at supermarket prices. Happy shopping. . ."

My friend and I were spoilt for choices. Other than food, there were apparel stores as well. The mall should look into having this event more frequently as it really liven up the spirits at night.

I knew exactly what style I wanted which made choice a lot easier. I bought mine from De preco. I always enjoy shopping in central and find that the prices are usually made for local people and not the foreigner. I was given a plastic card with all the rings details specified exactly. I had to have mine 3 sizes larger which cost me 10 pounds per size but as this was 18 carat white gold that was reasonable. I was also given a vat refund firm so that I could claim my tax back at the airport. The refund covered what I had spent getting resizing. My assistant at the shop was khun phu who really excelled herself. I had to tell her that I needed to go and check with my husband back in the u.k. and would be back. She did absolutely everything for me with a constant smile. Don't just take my word go and check out the counters and make someone happy."

My wife went back a second time without me - I was malled out by then - and she reported back with more stories of the sheer size of it.I thought we had some pretty big shopping malls in California, but nothing compares to this. It's very well done - modern, clean, not too upscale to intimidate the average person. I imagine there's something they don't have, but I don't know what it is!2 thumbs up if malls are your thing."

The fabric was actually meant for lining.After two bad experiences I think Travellers should stay in the main shopping mall - should have better control over quality and from dodgy store owners!"

Its worth the visit and I always enjoy shopping here. A shopping needs money so take some with you. There are many small shops also out side, street level that have many bargains and BIG C shopping center is opposite that contains more shops and relaxing areas. So good hunting and many people will say its expensive and I agree, but look in the right places and you will find bargains, I always do, not as cheap as Chatuchak market, but after all you are gong to a 5 star mall, there is a difference for your wallet.

You will never go hungry at Central World; in fact, I think that's why most people come here - for the food, not the shopping.There is also a cinema and and a gourmet supermarket on the 6th floor, so you can combine your shopping expedition with a movie and a meal. Movies are cheap here too; much cheaper than at home.There are Zen and Isetan dept stores, with a whole lane of Japanese restaurants near the Isetan store. There's a big Asia Books store, a B2S book and stationery store, and a selection of designer boutiques and other chain stores such as Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Ecco. You can spend all day here, and finish off with a cocktail at Zense or next door at the Red Sky Bar at the Centara Grand Hotel."

            "review": "Gem Scam. My family (including my father-in-law, mother-in-law, daughter of 4yrs and husband) and I were approached by a guy who claimed to be \"chief security boss\" at Central World, he told us it was a buddah's birthday that day and claimed that there will be rituals at the \"lucky\" temple. We were brought to the temple by a tuktuk driver who was claimed to be a \"safe\" tuktuk driver by the guy who spoke to us as he was supposedly \"used\" by the security officers located just outside Central World (which we realised one day after that the security officers there do not offer such services of introducing tuktuk drivers). We were driven to the temple, after a rather long route, about 15 mins, when it was supposedly pretty close to Central World when pointed out (I suspect the driver had purposely taken a much longer route so that the next person we were supposed to meet at the temple had sufficient time to go to the temple). I also realised a few times that the tuk tuk driver had made ridiculous U-turns when he could have just turned left or right just to drag more time. When we reached the temple, it looked abandoned instead of the bustling temple which we would have expected if it was really a special day. There was not a single soul, the temple looked run down, but we met this guy, quite well dressed, standing at the entrance of the temple. We asked him if this was the Lucky temple and if there was supposed to be a ritual for blessing. He said it was the temple, but the ritual had already been done at 6am in the morning. He then proceeded to tell us that he was the teacher of the temple, teaches buddist study and that he didn't work there. He guided us to go into the temple to pray, then we can take some holy water home in a bottle for blessing. He also told us we should stay in the temple for 5 minutes for good luck after praying. When we were done with praying, he pointed me out to follow him to the side of the buddah where there was a big pot of water, he gave me a mineral water bottle and told me to take some water home. I was surprised to see many mosquito lava in the water, and thought maybe it was common for thai temples, unlike the Singapore ones which will never allow breeding of mosquitos. The \"teacher\" then proceeded to talk to us, asking us where we are from, and that he has a lot of friends from Singapore. He slowly guided the topic into famous people like actors, policitians and the riches and told us that they all came to this temple to pray every year. They would also donate to the temple and that the temple looked so old because the buddah which was sitting in the temple refused to move even though there was a newer temple just beside the old temple we were in. He said the chef monk fell sick on the day the buddah was supposed to be moved, 3 times in a row, thus they decided to let the buddah stay in the old temple. Super convincing. He then said he wanted to have a look at my husband's hand, and after looking, he said his fingers had holes inbetween and that would lead to bad money luck. He told him he should wear blue sapphire and I should wear red ruby as red ruby is the heart of the buddah, to bring good luck for my family. He told us all the famous people would go to the Thai Export to buy these gems to bring them super good luck. He also added that we must get only the ones which have been blessed by 999 monks. The usual gems which haven't been blessed would not work. He said these 999 monks were returning the good deed to the public by chanting for these gems as the public had donated money to the monk hospital. The blessing would bring the person who wears the gem good luck and blessing. He also mentioned that my husband and i should wear the gems together to bring out the best. We then asked him where is the thai export, and he wrote on a piece of paper, and we asked him if he could guide the tuktuk driver to bring us there. He spoke to the tuktuk driver and showed him the piece of paper with only the name of the jeweller written on it (note that there was no address). The driver looked at it for a short while, nodded his head. Again, we were driven to the shop after a long drive of close to 20 minutes. I believe this amount of time was enough to gather the correct people to the jewel shop. At the jewel shop, when we entered, there was a lady who approached us and I asked specifically for the gems which were blessed by the 999 monks. The lady looked a little confused, then proceeded to guide us to a separate room. I asked again if the gems were blessed by 999 monks, and she said all their gems in the shop were blessed as the monks would bless their mine. Coincidently, there was a chinese lady with a baby in the shop, which we later realised didn't work there, but was just visiting as she stayed nearby. The thai lady got the chinese lady to speak to us and we could communicate better in mandarin. I asked her if there was really blessing for the gems and she claimed she went with them to the mines and the monks really did the blessing. She also added that the thais were very religious people and that they would not swap the stones (I asked her if we chose to custom make the rings, would they swap the stones). My parents were playing with the baby when I was speaking to the thai and chinese lady. After all the discussions and negotiations (I already negotiated close to a discount of 50000 baht), we were charged 108400 baht for 7 rings. Thank goodness we didn't have enough thai baht with us and our credit cards were not activated yet. We could only leave a deposit of 2000 baht. The owner was initially hesitant as he said to custom make, we needed to put at least 50% of the total amount. We insisted that we didn't have enough money on us and that 2000 baht was all we could afford. He agreed and we were supposed to pay the full amount when they brought the rings to our hotel the next day. We left and asked the tuktuk driver to bring us to the 4 face buddah. It suddenly occured to me to check if the whole thing was a scam when I was more clear headed, and true enough, I managed to find the name of the jeweler where we were at. Someone had been scammed there before. The name of the jeweler is called \"Manee Diamond\", the owner is called Mr Diamond. It was then we realised that the gem scam was common in thailand and that we could have possibly fallen into a scam. I then told my in laws that we should just leave the deposit and cancel the order to avoid and trouble. Afterall, we could have lost 106400 baht more, which is $4500 singapore dollars. So my husband called the jeweller and told him that our credit card couldn't be activated and cancelled the order. Thank goodness for all the reports online, otherwise we would have lost a big sum of money. I would like to share over here so that tourists visiting thailand would be more alert and aware of these scams. They make us of our beliefts and also our trust in fellowship. We believed that they would not dare to lie in front of the Buddah, and that they would not make us of religion, but we were absolutely wrong. They put our guards downs by bringing in people whom we are more comfortable around, like the Chinese lady and her 6 months old baby to play with our trust. When we had time to think carefully, everything just came together, all the long rides just gave them more time to prepare for the next stage. Now that you are reading this, you might think that we are stupid to have fallen into the scam, but in that moment, everything was so convincing. Hope that this will put the guards of tourists up and help to minimise or eliminate these scams altogether. All these people should really burn in hell."

If you want to go to a mall that is centrally-located and has the main chain stores, it's a good option. If you don't particularly like malls and chain stores, do avoid.Pros:- Centrally located; reasonably accessible by public transportation. Useful if you don't want to go all the way to Asoke, Phrom Phong, Thonglor and such.- Plenty of parking, which is a big advantage over Paragon.- Nice play area for kids.- Shops that I like: Central Food Hall (7F), Toys R Us and other kids' stores (5F), Uniqlo, H&M, Kinokuniya bookstore (6F Isetan), a small and relaxed ice-skating rink, and the Isetan supermarket (5F) is excellent for Japanese foods.- Very clean and modern.Cons: - It's a mall :p (but they're necessary and useful in Bangkok...)- Rajadamri Rd is always jammed, and it's a slight hike from the BTS station (Chitlom)Tips:- Go during mornings; it gets crowded (and parking gets full) once past noon.- For every B500 you spend in Central World, you get to ride an electric train with your kids (5F)."

The music kept the crowd going and there was a Thai fighting ring and the crowd was able to climb into the ring for a short period to take photos and celebrate. Being in the ring was a lot of fun and we had a great perspective of the area. The crowd was well behaved and watching the fireworks with the others celebrating was pretty awesome!

In fact, I think soon the Thais shopping here will be considerably wealthier than the tourists. My suggestion is wear comfortable shoes and expect to spend considerable time looking at the shops. Also have breaks often and take time out to sample some of the delicious cuisine available or to enjoy a tea or coffee. A foot massage after a day in this mall can be a godsend."

Last year was the snoopy theme which I liked most this year Dec 2015 is the Disney Theme which is more colourful but not as nice as Snoopy.Currently they have inside some nice deco and a Star War's show.My wife loves to come here to go shopping in the H&M.

Escalators are well placed. Connected to BTS and easily accessible by taxi.There are some pricy designer shops, but on the whole there are lots of shops geared to middle income folks so you can get value for your money. Upscale but not stratospheric.Good selection of eateries that are a great value - it is airy - lots of places to sit . ;o)ZEN department store is terrific. They had a massive sale when we were there and we got some terrific bargains. If you are a big person, you will not find any clothes that will fit you here - but that is pretty well true everywhere in Asia. The largest size that is typically stocked for women is a North American 12. Ditto with men's clothing. Hit the markets if you need larger sizes."

We met at the Chang Beer Festival section and with nine of us gathered around two tables we couldn't carry on a conversation with the person beside us, let alone across the table, because the music was deafeningly loud - over 90dBA. Positively painful to seniors ears. Conversation was absolutely impossible! After one drink we all left in disgust and went searching for a restaurant within the Central World Plaza complex. We found a selection of peaceful restaurants on the upper floors that afforded a conducive environment for an enjoyable meal and a drink or two ... in comfort."

These centres no longer the cheapy cheapy deals of Old Bangkok but you. An still get bargains with in-house brands at Zen for example offering 10-20-30 plus per cent off.

This used to be a row of 3 storey shop houses about 25 years ago, when they were demolished, World Trade Centre was the biggest shopping mall in central Bangkok. Still widely known as \"World Trade\", you hear the public bus announce this as they negotiate the traffic to try and stop somewhere near the bus stop.They changed the name to Central World after The Paragon started to steal all the customers, and they embarked on refurbishment and expansion.The main improvement was the removal of the dark floor tiles, replacing them with white which gave the whole place a lift. Previously it was dark and forbidding inside, now it\u2019s light and airy.Almost double the original size, it is easier to negotiate than The Paragon, but has everything you could ever need. Zen is the upmarket brand of Central Department Stores, and has many sale bargains. Isetan, although staffed by Thais, has the air of a Japanese department store about it and has many unique Japanese product lines.Some thought has gone into the layout of Central World, with similar retailers on specific floors, the higher floors are mainly food retailers, restaurants, fast food, buffets etc.Plenty of lifts and escalators and fairly easy to navigate, which is something you can\u2019t say about The Paragon.Groove is a new addition, behind Zen, it is a complex of bars and restaurants where you can find fine food and imported beers \u2013 not cheap, but a good people watching place. My favourite is Hyde & Seek, very good food with international wines and beers.Also part of the complex is the Centara Hotel, a very good evening and lunchtime buffet here, varying themes. One night is Argentinian Steak night with free flow wine and beer. The silly people were doing Buy One, Get One Free, so a group of us ended up only paying 50% of the proper bill and completely elephant\u2019s trunk, to this day, not one of us knows what mode of transport we used to get back, and what route we took, in fact no one even remembers leaving the building!It is a great place for brand name shopping, no bargaining though. I would rate it higher than The Paragon as it is a much less stressful experience.Get off the Skytrain at Chidlom or Siam, connect by walking along the Skywalk, it is well signposted."

There's also an adjoining hotel that provides 5-star stay and beautiful views of central Bangkok. Just be weary of traffic jams if you're planning a trip out of the city. Take the BTS instead."

By that I mean, it's all well known stores that can be found in a number of countries around the world. You will not find anything at cheaper prices.I read a lot of reviews that fawn over the food selection. I guess if you're look for chain restaurants that can be found anywhere in the world, have at it. If you're looking for better food, you have the whole of Bangkok to choose from. If you're looking for shopping, there are a host of markets in Bangkok that far better than anything you will find at Central World Plaza. I do suppose that if you're living in Bangkok, this is an alright place to come, but if you're visiting don't waste your time seeing what is familiar."

Great brands, clean, awesome foodstores, and simply a great place to shop. A concierge service. I just wish I'd had a longer time in Bangkok to enjoy this place more. Highly recommend this, if you're into High End shopping and shopping in general. There was an excellent bookshop for thai, english and other languages, and the japanese supermarket was awesome...... If I was living in Bangkok, I'd hang out here regularly."

I took this weird coconut puffs, pancakes alike, salty-sweet. Amazing!Though the prices are fair, you can find some good bargains if you stumble upon an occasional promotion. It is a very nice get-away at mid-hot-dayIf you were to pick a single shopping mall while you're in Bangkok, for trendy brands, this is the place. Find it to be way better then the siam paragon one.Nothing special worth mentioning - it's a shopping mall. A great one. Period."

Go during weekdays if you can, as during weekends it is packed with locals and tourists. Moreover, during weekends it is sooooo noisy as Thai people love to do promotions and entertainment activities for the visitors/shoppers and the music they play is extremely loud that you can hardly hear the person walking next to you. All mass brands are there. The kids section can be improved, only one international brand store (mothercare), the rest are locals, and offer just clothing. The restaurant section is great if you like eating in the malls. It is on the last floor, has all the cuisines you would imagine. It has also a great supermarket on the top floor, but obviously much more expensive than small supermarkets on the street like viva market for example."

Taste of green curry sauce paired very well with the deep fried chicken patty yums!3) During the long weekend holiday, Boots Pharmacy had this \"Buy 2 get 1 free\" promotion. I was stunned by the variety of the product ranges and actually walked out without getting anything.4) Another long weekend promotion at the Central Food Hall on the 7th floor. There were a few flavours of Ritter Sport chocolates which were not seen before in my country. Bought a few bars which were on discount. Sweet!Cons: The mall is huge with the addition of Zen as well. Not an ideal place for a person who lacks a good sense of direction.Areas to improve: 1) More telco competitors for prepaid sim cards. DTac doesn't seem worth it as one needs to purchase two packages for a normal sim card and internet. I got a TruMove simcard at one of the kiosks at 6th Floor of Platinum Fashion Mall.2) Concierge needs to look more approachable - The one I chose to speak to had this \"you-owe-me-tons-of-money\" look on her face."

I like heading over to this mall due to its comprehensive amenities such as a considerable number of restaurants ranging from low to high end, movie theatres, supermarket and great shopping.Firstly, the range of restaurants at the mall caters to all walks of life and budget. With the wide range of food available (Western, Jap, Chinese, Thai, etc), you\u2019ll be spoilt for choice. There is also a food court at the higher levels which serves up local delights at quite affordable prices, although it is considered pricey for the locals.Secondly, there is a great movie theatre which is well furbished and comfortable if tourists would like go watch the latest shows. Theatre food such as popcorn, nachos, and drinks are warm as I do understand some theatres serves cold food. However, the issue with the theatre is that before a show is screened, they will play the national anthem where all the Thais will have to stand in attention prior. For Tourist, it may be uncomfortable but this is their way of life. It would be good to respect their culture by standing with them.Thirdly, they have a large supermarket above and if anyone needs to buy travel items, you can head there to take a look. Lastly, shopping is great but just to not that the mall caters mostly to the mid to high end of shoppers. For great deals, you can head to Naraya which is their local bag brand and it is really popular with Asian tourist as they are decently priced. I have friends or relatives whom will ask to help get Naraya items whenever I fly to Bangkok. They too have a large departmental store, Isetan, which sells a wide range of items. They too even sell Japanese food at the high levels.Just a note, the mall is really large and if you really want to take a walk around, it would take more than 3 hours of shopping to cover the whole area."

Of those 37 places ranked above Central World, three (Chatuchak Weekend Market, Siam Paragon, and Terminal 21) are places to shop. The other 34 are tailor shops! And, of those I checked, how many reviews for tailor shops are from 1-post wonders? And what might that suggest?Perhaps TA should isolate tailor shops into a separate category, so that those places don't \"muck up\" the rankings for everything else.Of all the shopping centres in Bangkok, I suppose my favourite is MBK - as that place has the highest percentage of individually owned, or otherwise somewhat unique, vendors among shopping centres in Bangkok. My personal #2 would have been the \"World Trade Centre\" this place, before the rebranding - as that might have been #2 for originality. After the rebranding, Central World became rather less unique. But it still is probably my #2 preferred shopping centre after MBK. The others are mostly same-same, but same-same (in contrast to the popular saying \"same-same but different\"), if you get the drift of that wording.Central World is well-located. It has several shops which are not the same-same chains of most other shopping centres in Bangkok. It is, however, a shadow of its former self when it was Bangkok's WTC - even if it is now larger. Those that will remember the WTC may appreciate why someone might say that. Others would probably not understand."

You can find just about every brand name shop and every restaurant you can imagine. It has an excellent movie theater on the top and ice skating on the first floor.It is hard to explain this place visually unless you really go but it will almost take your breath away.

Lots have already been said - yes it absolutely massive, though I read about it I could not imagine a shopping centre this big.My favourite part is the food court / market on the 7th floor - there's cinemas on this level too but you have to check out this floor. SO MANY restaurants and at reasonable priced. If you prefer real cheap and yummy go to the market section on this floor and you'll see a food court there and there's so much to chose from - all authentic Thai food. They'll give you a coupon/card which you hang on to and hand over to the stall as you're ordering food and then you pay for it as you exit the area by giving the cashier the coupon. Nice and simple. I got greedy and ordered a barbeque pork with rice and crispy pork and both came to 160 baths which is like $6AUD - loved it. Then went over to the Thai desert and had the sticky rice with crushed ice and some sweet coconut sauce for 25bahts, once again was the most amazing yummy thing. While on this floor I also had a desert (different day) from an ice cream / mango place. Everything is mango flavour but there was this thing called mango treasure? Anyway, its mango sticky rice flavoured ice cream topped with real mango! OMG, it was a decent size serving and I had intended to have just a taste but couldn't stop eating it! For my own sake I'll stop going on about the food but yes, if you love food, especially if you're a fan of Thai food, you must go there and get up to level 7 :-). Also - on this floor, there's a restaurant at each corner of the building, just when I think, I've found all the restaurants, there were more as I kept walking."

The prices of clothing in central world were just about the same as in the U.S., so I would suggest looking elsewhere for clothes, such as platinum, before shopping at central world. There are also many restaurants inside, from U.S. food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, and Starbucks to traditional Thai food restaurants. Personally, I prefer the street-side restaurants for my meals but if you are looking to get out of the heat for a while, then you can definitely find something good to eat in the air conditioned Central World."

Also, after you pay three times the price of a normal movie ticket they charge you extra for a coke zero (apparently only regular soft drinks are included in ticket price). The seats are nice, but that is it. The cinemas at other malls are much more worth it."

There was some entertainment going on - a beauty pageant and the Thai Food Festival was happening outside.

This place is immense, and offers for sale just about everything one could dream of and then some. I was looking for an outer shirt to replace one that was worn out, and a local friend recommended this mall, and a specific store. The recommended store had exactly what I was looking for -- in \"S\" size only. I've enjoyed a few too many scoops of coconut ice cream to ever fit into an \"S\" again, and asked if they had anything larger. \"Not until next month\". But luckily, another store in the same complex had the exact item I needed in \"L\", and it fit. The stores are an eclectic mix of haute name brands and budget stores (OK, maybe a fairly big budget), with very helpful staff, even in the cases where they don't have exactly what you were looking for. At the first shop, the clerk made a number of suggestions for alternatives as well as an idea of where else in the mall the item might be found. At the shop where I did end up buying the shirt, the sales clerk took the time to make sure I had the proper VAT refund paperwork in hand before I left the store.If I had not been on a tight schedule to get to a social function across town, I would have stayed longer to take in the fascinating retail architecture and perhaps have found some coconut ice cream to celebrate my purchase. :>)"

True and Dtac are all represented on the third floor. There is also a free App available to find the shop you need to go. At some information stands, you will be given a free wifi code after identification. About restaurants, go higher. You'll find all kind of varieties of food; Japanese (Shabushi) and others sushi places, a SIZZLER with all you can eat salad buffet, Koreans , Vietnamese not to mention the common fast food chains. On 7th floor is a Tops Superstore and even a food court. On the direct link to Grand Centara at Central World Hotel you will pass a cinema multiplex with all facilities too. There is always something going on at Central World, in the ground floor circle, where escalators lead clockwise up, and down in. The other direction.

The market offers a good selection of cheese and the bakery has a variety of delicious items. In the 'winter' months, there are beer gardens set up in the front court of the center. The beer gardens serve all kinds of beer and local dishes. They also have life bands. It is a fun place to visit, especially in the 'winter' filled with holidays spirits and year end sales. The center leads to other shopping centers via the sky walk to Gaysorn and Emerald Shopping Arcade on one end and to Siam Paragon, Siam Discovery, and MBK on the other end.Hope this helps those visiting this are for the first time.

Our flight was at 6am so we didn't want to book a hotel, instead we went to Central World and watched the latest film they had showing, 12.30am, which kept us occupied until our 3am taxi to the airport. Fantastic, modern cinema with excellent service, they even let us charge our phones while we watched (we had the whole cinema to ourselves)."

More like your traditional western malls with a wide mix of stores from sports to fashion to food etc. Some of the high end retailers and fashion brands were there also.The prices were fairly marked up, you won't really find any bargains there, but it was a wonderful mall that you could a good few hours looking around and then stop in for some late breakfast or lunch - again don't expect any bargain food prices either.Overall a nice mall. Just not a mall you would visit to find good prices. It's purely for the tourists and you won't find many locals shopping in there."

The mall located at the ratchaprasong junction, so you can even reach there by cab or bus which u can drop off in front of mall. If you choose sky train, you may need to take a bit walk from the sky walk. And you can walk either from Siam Station or Chidlom Station. From this mall, you can walk across the street to High end mall like Erawan Plaza and Gaysorn Plaza. Or you can walk by the corner to Platinum mall; the wholesales mall.Inside the mall it's include 2 malls (zen and Isetan) + 1 big plaza. Now they just expand new Zone called groove which have brand name stuffs including restaurant and bars open till late night.The mall also next to the hotel which it would give you another choice of dining experiences and chill out place on rooftop bar and enjoy the city view.Zen; is the middle class of brand and they sell varieties of products separate products by each floor. So you will easily find stuffs like cosmetic floor, male floors female floor etc.Isetan; is similar to Zen in way they categorize products by floor but the uniqueness is they served Japanese products as the main focus. There're selection of Japanese products and desserts on supermarket floor, Japanese food restaurants and Japanese book shop like kinokuniya etcThe plaza area just in the middle and there're varieties of branded stuffs, restaurants, grab and go food counter, they even separate floor for mobile and technology stuffs, varieties of bank services, sport and even furnitures. There's supermarket on the top and the theatre on the same floor. Groove area also serve something different and Give you more selection on shopping points and dinner options. I really love to go this mall as they always on sales. It's really motivating to go for shopping."

I didn't have much money so I was pretty much restricted to window shopping, but the good news for anyone who may be interested was that there was a lot to see. I have no idea if their prices were competitive, unfortunately, though given that this was a high-end mall and not some air-conditioned flea market I'm guessing I wouldn't have been able to haggle my way through anything. Besides, one doesn't just go to malls for the things to buy but for the ambience, and in my opinion this place had it in spades.I wouldn't mind going back with a bit more money next time. ;)"

Excellent shopping including some traditional Thai goods, and many excellent and reasonably priced restaurants. While Paragon remains my favorite (close by) better deals and value can be had at Central World. It killed me when the Red Shirts burnt it down but now it is restored and better than ever. The Chang beer garden out front is fun at night and has good music."

The choices of dining is superb, from the restaurants on Level 7 to that foodcourt to Zense rooftop bar. Can I just say that the food court is amazing? A tad more expensive by Thai standard (but still nothing by usd standard) the quality there is outstanding. Every stall nails it with the seasoning and presentation. If you're after great street food right infront are those famous eateries with the salted hanging grilled fish. You can easily have the best Thai street food experience there with $15 and easily feed four.The shopping is also great as the walkways are so wide and spacious. The only Topman/Topshop in Bangkok is located here. I just find Central very peaceful to walk through shopping experience."

Its bigger than Siam Paragon, better in that it remains accessible for shoppers with different budgets. I tend to group this mega mall complex with Siam Paragon and Gaysorn. Whereas a step down in spending might see you shopping at Terminal 21 or perhaps MBK for thrifty savings.I like the choices on offer at Central World, though I prefer the bargain hunting at MBK.

But what was unique about this particular tree was it was upside down and littered with Snoopys of all different sizes and colors.Although we have been to Central world plaza before it never ceases to amaze me with the central decorations.It has a good food floor, but not like the other shopping malls ,Central world dose not have a food court, it has a floor with restaurants catering for all tastes and palettes.Central world plaza also boasts (if my mind serves me well) a 12 screen cinema ,from cheap seats,to first class seats ,3D and now a 4D screen too.On the whole a simply fantastic place to shop,eat and be entertained.

It really is a one stop mall (2 floors for clothes, 1 for electronics, 1 for food, 1 for furniture, a few SPAS and massage places and a cinema and ice rink). I prefer it to the Dubai mall. Its really clean, nicely decorated, hasnt got too expensive clothes (you can buy souvenirs and Thailand Tshirts at the MBK shopping mall in opposite, but its more like a massive market than a shopping mall) and the food at Central World is really amazing. They even have my favourite Burger place which you only see in Japan - MOS Burger...if u see it, you should give it a try :) anyway, I highly recommend this mall. Once you are in that area you can also go to Siam Paragon Mall, MBK and Siam Center..its all in opposite. But Central World Plaza was enough for me :) you just take the BTS Skytrain to Siam."

There were two department stores that I wasn't able to visit but I still spent 6 hours there. There's an ice skating rink, different ice cream and dessert shops as well as a nicer eating area called Grove where there are different food and fusion food slightly more expensive than what is inside the main Central World.

I was taken here by a half German half Thai national that I met in the city. Tried the Korean restaurant on the top floor. Decent food. A bit pricey. The ice coffee from the stands on the side of the road on the outside of the mall is excellent. If you're lucky there might be a market (day and night) set up at the front of the mall selling a wide variety of street food and drinks that looks more hygienic and appetizing than your typical run of the mill street food carts. Food here is pretty tasty as well."

By understanding the set-up, a visitor can either pick and choose the area they intend to visit on that specific day or browing each area with a knowledgable perspective. Start with the external outdoor area where from time-to-time certain theme-event is created to attract visitor to the complex. Check whether the theme is to your liking. Second on the floor of the atrium, there is always commercial event to launch or relaunch certain product and does have special promotion with price and give-away. Third the whole upper level dining and supermarket, choosing the restaurant or browsing the supermarket can be fun. Fourth the entertainment complex on the top for your movie etc. Five and most of all, the shops of most international brands with their up-to-date products and sales signs in order to separate you and your money. By understanding the complex well can help you to avoid the frustration in braving through the shopping complex in a busy day. Prepare to spend at least 3-4 hours if this is your first visit. Have fun!!!!!"

We may not have big bang here cos they are in Singapore at that moment but we also got a huge bang!Just get a proper dj that can do the count down on stage!The explosive fireworks display really rock the crowd!Only improvement is to have more toilets.

There is vegetarian booth too; I'm working my way down the list of about 20 different dishes just at that one booth. Save room for the Thai sweets there in the food court or the numerous ice cream, Japanese dessert stands outside of the grocery store. You'll be full, satisfied, and so happy when you've spent under USD 10 per person for so many different dishes, and even had a drink and dessert with all that.

I highly recommend the restaurants located in the top floor of Isetan and the Zen restaurant near Kinokuniya Bookstore. Naturally, some of their ramen broth is a bit spicy, most likely to cater to the locals' tastes.The mall has a wide variety of stores, and most of them carry international brands like Topshop, H&M, Cath Kidston etc. If you're thinking of getting books, apart from Kinokuniya, there's Asiabooks and B2S. Word of caution though - books in English is not cheap.During my stay in Bangkok, I made a pair of spectacles here as well. It was quite affordable due to the 30% discount on my frames. However, the prescription for the lenses is quite strong despite the optician responding to my complaints of dizziness during the lens fitting. So it is really advisable to just purchase the frames alone. Should you be interested in getting a pair there, they just need about one day to make a pair of eye glasses. Transition lens will take at least 3 days though. There were two key stores that my family and I had planned to visit from the start, which were Naraya and Boots. NaRaYa is a local bag brand that has a strong feminine touch to their designs. They also have special design for occasions like Christmas and Lunar New Year. Bags there are quite affordable. I bought a duffel bag and shoulder bag for 480 baht and 220 baht respectively. Boots is a pharmacy chain originating from the UK. They sell affordable and good shampoos and body soap. We bought 8 tubes of hair shampoos (Boots brand, of course) for 50 baht each. Hopefully this is enough to last the year, haha! As Christmas was around the corner, outside of the mall was this giant Christmas trees with a sea of Snoopys at the foot of the tree. Perfect photography opportunity if you ask me. There were 4 outdoor bars as well, belonging to 3 different beer brands - Chang, Singha and Heineken. Each bar had their own live band performing, so you can imagine how lively it was! I'm not sure if these outdoor bars are permanent as during my parent's previous visit in January, they remarked it was quite quiet. On a bright note, what will definitely be there are these small shrines located outside the mall, towards the direction of Platinum Mall. Everyday, you'll be able to witness the locals offering flowers and their prayers to the altars. One of the altars accepts only roses as offerings, while the other, a type of orange blossom. Sometimes, there are so much flowers that you can catch a whiff of fragrance in the air. There are stalls selling these flowers nearby. It is an interesting sight, especially at night, where you this contrast between the two adjacent activities - quiet, solemn prayers at the altars on one side and the intense, catchy music on the other."

A lot of people really enjoyed and were taking photos. The part that was a bit confusing was when i had to go inside and take a lift to the floor that i wanted. I did. Ot realize that. If i had only walked a bit more in the corridor around the corner i would have reached the main floor where all The shops were. I guess if it is the first time it can be a little bit confusing. But once you are inside a lot of things to buy and see. There are quite a lot of restaurants and food outlets and Even a cinema in the top floor. I had a few hours in Bangkok so i enjoyed some cool time inside the mall in the hot afternoon. Although after walking around a lot one does start to get tired. It was a pity that the i e skating rink was not there as i would have loved to see it. But all on all, it was very interesting and a very good way to spend and hour or two in the afternoon in Bangkok.I would definitely recommend anyone to just go and have a look at the all and the display outside for this christmas."

I shopped at my first H&M here and loved every moment of it. I had looked up what stores were being homed here before leaving for Thailand and good thing I did, the levels just went on forever that you could end up lost but it's a good thing to get lost in here because you can find random stalls/shops and find some great buys, I bought some amazing smelling room scents, lots of gifts for friends and found all but 1 of the stores I wanted to shop in. The food court here is amazing!! I had the freshest grilled salmon with garlic sauce here and had a delightful strawberry tea juice. The supermarket area was really good too. Stocked up on snacks, water and everything else throughout the weeks. Staff were all lovely and eager to help you however they could. The only things I wasn't too thrilled about was the toilets, I thought they could have been a bit cleaner but all the shopping and nice staff make up for it at least in my case."

No, really I jest, its worth a little more time as just having a pot of Twinings tea takes at least that, doesn't it Bertie? There's much that's worth avoiding here of course, but JT, Zen, Kum Poon & the cinemas on the top floor with the latest showings, all consume too much time. Oh yes, yes, I'd rather be exploring another temple, or some new jungly bit in Isaan or the far north, but really not on a grim day like this. So with a 60's watch in for repair down by the post office (for a bargain price), I headed for Zen, collected some new Santa's towels & Parker jotter 125 in fluorescent jade green. A 3D movie, (Guardians of the Universe) & then out into the dark again to a mega hotel nearby. Its one of the better super malls, although the others seem to have the really high end designer gear. Its worth a visit, whatever time it takes, but I am left wondering how many mega malls this city really needs & can support?"

A giant, foreigner-friendly, first-world mall. It's got plenty of air-conditioning and kid-friendly restaurants. It has Thais around, but not much of what you might call Thai shopping. Now, the big question: why come to Thailand just to visit a mall? That's like paying big bucks to watch an IMAX 3D movie just to enjoy the concession-stand candies. It's a pleasant enough break from the heat, and is perhaps a reward for kids putting up with temples and palaces. Don't spend more than an hour here, though - Thailand has far more interesting places to see."

First the parking area was very confuse and most shoppers were lost either trying to find parking space or finding the exit. After the Central Group took over, the parking underground was redirected. Once the hotel was built, additional parking of 1000 cars was added. The new parking allows shopper to find plenty more parking space plus getting to the level of their choice. Overall the parking availability and friendly is the best among all shopping complex. Now for shopper that do not drive their car. The Central World divided the shops into different level by their merchandisers. Much thought had been putted into their design. Firstly the central core of the up and down was greatly expanded to give the free flow for the shoppers. Secondly, the escalators in moving up or down were synchronized for the convenience of the shoppers. Thirdly, the shops were position to attract the potential customer with minimum effort. All-in-all, the whole complex created an easy going and relax atmosphere for shoppers."

The spatial design though was a little confusing so it actually took a bit of time to get my bearings. That said, there're plenty to do and lots to see. If you're into doing some serious shopping, be prepared to spend at least half a day here. It's got plenty to cater to everyone. Though not very many choices for those with more expensive taste.There's no Skytrain stop here. Nearest one is Siam station which is about 10min walk away and can be reached via elevated (covered) pedestrian passageways.Chris Lee"

Because of its cheap labor, Thailand is a good place to buy lingeries, bikinis, sports shoes and jeans. The restaurants are nice on the upper floors. And the seasonal decorations will always amaze you. Right now the Teddy Bear is having a road show on the 1st floor. it is really cute."

All the shops here are on the sophisticated scale. I even heard an Australian man lecturing his wife about how the dress she was looking at cost $5000 once they did the currency conversion. That was quite humorous. Not all the clothes here are that expensive though. Each floor seems to have something different on it. From the clothes on the bottom levels, to the furniture level, to the education level to the cinema and supermarket on the 7th floor. There is everything for every kind of shopper. A part of the building extends off into an office block and there is a small group of upscale restaurants near here as well. The whole mall was spotless and easy to negotiate. There are lifts and elevators to get around on. Central World advertises itself as a global award winning mall and I can see why. It is freaking fantastic."

There's even a kids train on the 4th floor that takes you around the food courts. Boomerang is great for DVD, CD's (check region first). They also have major chains (avoid as they are cheaper in the UK, Top Shop and H&M was almost double the price). If you have hours to kill, money to spend and an appetite, this malls for you.

Although it is one of the biggest malls in SE Asia, it does not have the charm of other malls such as Terminal 21 or Amarin Plaza. However, it is better than anything the UK have to offer in terms of shopping malls. They mainly have western shops, with the import tax being 50%, it may be worth reconsidering purchases at certain outlets. It is not really tourist geared as it is for Bangkok's wealthier population, but good fun to look through. If you like malls, and large ones at that, it's worth a visit."

Once walking in, it's here one will realize they can buy virtually everything they may be looking for and the center has everything from jewelry, some small pharmacies, electronics to clothes, beauty and health, art and antiques, and of course, a great selection of food to choose whatever one may be craving for. If at all in question about what you would like to visit, just make a short walk to the concierge desk on the ground floor and they can tell you instantaneously where it is you may need to go.

Other than that, Central World has everything. Prices are the same as the UK for many items and can be more expensive for western branded goods. You can get bargains at end of season sales in various stores. Large choice compared to most western malls and better quality than MBK.We go here for eating, the cinema, Asia Books and SuperSports.Difficult to navigate but off the main thoroughfare there are some decent shops where bargains can be had at certain times. A lot depends on what is being discounted at that particular time.Dining options are plentiful. Mainly up on the 6th & 7th floors and are reasonably priced. You pay standard prices at chain outlets e.g. MK/Fuji, not the enhanced prices you find in Paragon. Cinema viewing options are many. I always recommend visiting friends to try the 1st Class package if available. Going to the cinema here is 10x better than in the West either on price or on service.At the back of CW is the Centara Grand Hotel. Try the Red Sky bar on the 55th floor. Amazing views and better value than other similar roof top bars in the city. Outside CW there are often interesting exhibitions on the concourse facing Ratchadamri Rd. At the moment, there is a large photo exhibition at the south end with the rest taken up with Xmas themes and beer bars ahead of the New Year.CW is always an interesting place to wander around at any time of the year."

They have some interesting restaurants there: Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Korean like in other places but also Vietnamese or Italian. Of course, there are also many places to sit for coffee or tea. Starbucks offer a cosy, enclosed area. I prefer the openness of Coffee Beans & Tea Leaves in one of the two main halls or the quiet atmosphere of the Illy Caf\u00e9 near the skywalk entrance. The large esplanade in front of the building holds some major exhibits or events. For instance, they had an interesting photography exhibition on mainland China for some time. Sometimes it becomes a showroom or a night beer garden.

Seating in \"sofa seat\" for two will cost around THB 500 to THB 700 depending the cinema or movie ... not sure why the difference in price.Worth visiting and comparing to other cinema experiences.

Since then it's been very successful.And it's easy to tell why. Seven floors of stores. You really can get everything here. The usual luxury brands, endless clothing, electronics, instruments, beauty products, DVD's, books, furniture etc. And even a bunch of plastic surgeons are located here (mostly for the face).There are several restaurants with different cuisines to choose from. The cheapest option would be the mall's foodcourt, that's where we went. The food is very basic, but well-priced and offers great views.There's even an ice skating rink if you want to show off your skills.We shopped some clothes and and also some DVD's. The DVD's here in the several stores are nicely priced and original - not these illegal copies (which might not even work properly). If you take time to look you might find some rare movies.The mall also has a great supermarket with lots of fresh veggies and fruits. And some local producers sell their products at some stalls on the ground floor (fruits, snacks, meat and sausages...). Good stuff!You really can have a fun time here. There's something for everybody and for every budget. The layout of the mall is a bit fuzzy. You might get lost sometimes - especially if you look for a particular shop. But there's directories everywhere.Wanna know more about me and my travels? Check my profile (with a link to my website)."

I find mens shoes to be good value - got genuine (made in Thailand ) Hush puppies in Zen for $40 which is a good deal. Not as nice as Siam Centre but most definately cheaper.

I particularly loved ZEN department store, it's trendy, lots of Thai designers and also a great variety and choice of shoes and accessories. The quality of the goods is also very goodLovely ambiance and store design. The ladies underwear choice is amazing. They had a sale on and they give extra discounts to tourist with the central world tourist card scheme. On top of which you can claim the 7% vat back so in the end I got some super bargains. The food court is superb and the variety of eateries is bewildering."

Went to Central World Plaza for 2 reasons, first is Naraya Bags :) yes, a must buy in Bangkok and the outlet is very packed most of the time, comfortable shopping mall with variety range of international product if wholesale market is not your cup of tea. Second is the food, but not in the food court or any outlet in the building ( there is Ting Tai Feng in KL too, not necessary to have it in BKK) walk out to the mall, towards the Platinum Mall direction, whereby you can see many open stalls selling bbq fish and other thai food, go to the one with most local people sitting, and I guarantee it will be the best with really cheap price and tasty food ! one big BBQ fish is only THB 150 and it is really yummy, and we also had the most tasty tomyam soup there."

Its spacious layout allows you to stroll and window-shop at the mostly high-end shops and boutiques as well as grab a bite at one of the countless eateries, just about all of them of high standard. From local fare to Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Indian to outlets like Sizzler and Pizza everything seems too be available. It is probably impossible to get bored there. At the Isetan wing there is this great bookshop KINOKUNYA, on the 7th floor there are the brilliant cinema halls, always worth a visit. Downstairs there's an ice-rink(!) with skates for rent (sessions last 1.5 hrs).Although it can get quite crowded on weekends, it never feels you'll get crushed any time soon, unlike at other malls nearby.Attached to the sky-walk the WTC can easily be reached by BTS (skytrain). Only problem I have encountered on various occasions are the taxi-drivers who are properly pulled in by the staff but then more often than not refuse to take the fare. That, however, is a common problem in Bangkok"

My tip would be to walk pass the restaurant and through the food hall, where you can buy fresh food and at the very back is a card based food court. You get a card then enter the food court and have around 30 vendors to choose from, you order you plate then handover our card and they enter the amount you owe on, get a drink and more food then at the end you hand your card in on the way out and pay you bill.Plus the food is fantastic and very very reasonable."

I LOVE going to the international food market, just to look at the sheer variety of food they have. The movie theater is lovely. Central World also has events and festivals throughout the year. It's a good place to catch free (or cheap) concerts. They also have cute displays that are always nice to take pictures with.Because of its central location, it has become a place where political events take place as well. I've been down there on days of rallies. It might be better to stay away when that happens, but even then it's been ok. The only real problem was a few years ago when the rally got way out of control, but since then security has been very tight."

Great place for a drink while enjoying the breathtaking views of Bangkok.*) The variety of food they offer is the best, especially Thai ice cream. I recommend trying out Freshy Freeze ice cream on the highest floor (by the elevator near Swensens). The ice cream they sell is fantastically scrumptious! It might get a tad pricey, but definitely worth it. *) CTW is separated in to 3 zones: Isaton, Zen and CTW plaza. There are tonnes of shops and restaurants in this department stores. Moreover, there is a skytrain walking line which is linked to Paragon and Central Chidlom.*) Skytrain Siam then follow signs, 5-10 minutes walk, alternative Skytrain Ratchadamri, exit all, see 4 face Buddha on the way then cross busy intersection and you are there *) Further, from Central Plaza you have direct access to the MRT.

The tom yum ramen at a local chain restaurant with an \"8\" logo is unique and delicious.

Zen has out-of-the ordinary merchandise (dont forget to check out the food loft on the top floors!) while Isetan needs a revamp!There are hundreds of outlets all along the floors. Go for the special sales that are usually held at the various atriums if you dont have the time.And yes!! bring your credit cards!!"

Its located on the 7th floor and buying the tickets was easy and very effcient. 4 tickets cost us 1200 Bahts. However, the popcorn was very bland and I could only find 'traces' of the butter in the so called Butter Popcorn. The theater was clean, the seats comfy and the sound system was amazing. We saw the movie in 3 D and I have to admit it was really amazing. So life like !"

Depending on the total purchase, you get little stickers, and perhaps a voucher. This makes you shop even more. So tricky! Get 1-5 stickers and your next set of purchases is 20% off. You need 6 stickers to get 30% off. Overall a very expensive shopping experience.When you get tired, go to Level 7 to the food court. Get a plastic card, go to whatever counter you want, order, they scan your card and you pay at the end.Before you leave Level 7, go to the VAT counter to get your receipts stamped so you can get the VAT refund at the airport. Be alert! The Tax stamp office is just inside the airport, and you need 1 more stamp before you go through immigration to the actual VAT refund counter on the other side."

You can request for free WiFi password upon placing your orders, but the second you settled your bill. You will be cut off immediately! So, surf till you had enough , then ask for the bill.

We had a value-for-money breakfast at the Central World Hotel\u2019s Zing outlet which is on the ground floor, to the left of the Central World building. The set breakfast which seemed popular and which we ate was 199 Baht for two mini-pastries, butter and jam, cut fruits, an orange drink, and coffee per person.The Central World building was decked for the Christmas season, and in the Atrium, stands a Christmas tree that is several stories high! We spent a couple of hours going through the shops selling mostly branded imported products and what caught our interest was the Central Food Hall. Such a lot to see and browse through at this location. Lunch was at Kum Poon restaurant diagonally opposite the Food Hall and the Thai food there is truly authentic and spicy! We noticed that many locals were eating at this outlet. Prices were reasonable and won\u2019t break your pocket!If you feel too tired out to walk back to the Kempinski, a short Tut-tut ride to the hotel will cost you about 80 Baht. In fact if you bargained hard enough it can cost less. The tut-tuts are available outside the Central World building along the road."

It is not too expensive, but the everything is fresh. Their salmon sashimi melted in my mouth, and the grilled snow fish set was out of this world. YUMMY!- Prann on the third floor, this is a natural line for Thai products, they have a website. I really liked it for myself and for presents to others. Thann on the second floor is very similar, although they have more variety. Very recommended!- I enjoyed shopping some stationary at B2S, I think on the second floor. You can also send some Postcards from the Post-office inside B2S, on the same floor. Convenient!- A nice cup of tea can be enjoyed at Secret Garden, on the sixth floor. It is a very nice little caf\u00e9 with a choice of cakes, the pan-cake type being their signature one. I tried the Earl Grey cake, and it was very nice!- And of course everybody can find exactly what they want, since the mall is very big and the selection of virtually everything is great.Have a great time!"

The restaurants on the top level looks very chic , pricey I'm sure, but hey you live only once, why not splurge from time to time ?

There is nothing especial about it and the layout is a bit haphazard. I personally prefer the Paragon shopping centre which is just 500 metres away. Then again why not visit both for a bit of overdose."

But this city continues to surprise me, Centralworld is huge, with all the usual stores - the recent addition of a Uniqlo is a bonus (cheap basics from Japan); What sets it aside, though, is ZEN. I think most Department stores are a waste of time, you really need to be a local to find what you want quickly - This is quite interesting, though. Wacky displays & the inclusion of stuff from Vivienne Westwood & young Thai designers makes this a stand-out."

If you get off at Siam walk towards Chidlom or if you get off at Chidlom walk towards Siam. Impossible to miss! Lots of restaurants to choose from. My favourite is Laem Cha Reon Seafood. Tasty Thai Shrimps patties (Tawt Man Goong). They've been around for about 30 years with the first one opening in a port city southeast of Bangkok. There's four or five outlets including one at Siam Paragom (Siam Skytrain station). Seventh floor is pretty neat! A movie theatre which like most movie theatres in Bangkok allow toselect actual seats like at a concert! Buy your seats and then go shopping. Prices are cheap $5 or $6 Cdn per ticket. Don't forget to stand and show respect when national anthem plays along with video of King and Queen! It's only a few minutes but very rude to talk or stay seated.Next to movie theatre is Gourmet Market an excellent upscale supermarket which includes some restaurants plus a superb food court with lots of cheap Thai food and a nifty juice bar that makesa delicious Mango slush! There's a skating rink inside on the first floor and B2S store which is part of a chain which offers Stationary, Books, CD's, coffee shop, etc. Cover three floors and is the biggest B2S outlet in Bangkok. Two department store Zen at one end and Isetan at the other near B2S. Isetan is from Japan but sells product from all over the world.They also have a supermarket with a food court on the same floor (5th or 6th). Secret Recipe is a small chain well known for it's cheesecake! They other outlets in Bangkok that are also cafes in Siam Paragon, Terminal 21 and Emporium.Sometimes Central World has special market stalls set up on the ground floor usually with discounts, samples and live fashion and/or live music. Quite the hoot! It's a good idea to pickup the Bangkok Post and English newspaper costing a dollar that has a daily listing of sales, shows, entertainment, specials, arts, restaurant promos, freebies, fairs etc."

When we went outside, there were some exhibitions and we witness a traditional thai boxing event...dance...very interesting for tourists like us.Further down next to this building is the Platinum mall..a whole sale market for clothe,bags, etc....You can get here by stopping at Siam or Chitlom station. just continue from station and it will lead you to all the famous malls. this is what I like about the mall set up. One does not get wet when it rains..all covered and for many miles....smile.Happy Shopping...you get teh high end and whole sale all within this shopping belt!"

Certainly easy to get lost and the range of shops in immense. Everything is very clean and organised and there were staff and security throughout the centre to help. A nice air-conditioned haven and a busy, interesting part of Bangkok. Don\u2019t miss the two shrines out the front \u2013 the Ganesha and Trimurti Shrines that are near the north end of the centre. Also the open area at the front is nice, with interesting fountains and some nice places to sit and watch the world go by. Access to Central World Plaza is very easy \u2013 the Chit Lom BTS station is near the south end or it is a short end from the Pratunum ferry stop on Klong San Saep."

One of my favourite pastimes in Bkk is to spend a few hours dawdling around the CWP shops, mostly 'window shopping' but occasionally buying a few things that are either not available in my home city, or are clearly cheaper. The highlights for me have to be the newly refurbished ZEN department stone, Isetan and the food hall on the top floor. The Cinema is a joy to visit & still at prices that have long since disappeared in the now ludicrously overpriced & unfeasibly expensive UK. From time to time there are exhibitions, this time it was German Minis & Swedish Volvos at screen prices I hope we wont see in the UK for another 100 years. The highlight of the trip was coaxing my reluctant partner into PNC panache to have her hair (attended to by amateurs previously) beautifully restyled for a mere 700 baht. Whilst I waited patiently a stream of glossy magazines & green tea came my way. Once I explained what it would cost in the UK my partner stopped protesting the price. My only criticism is that at around 3-4pm the coffee & tea shops fill up with large groups of school kids doing their homework communally. It's at this point I only wish that CWP had a Wetherspoon's (or similar) nearby where I could escape to get a pint & a pannini..."

Perhaps the best thing about these buildings is that they are always cools nd very clean. NOTE COOL AS THAT COUNTS ALONE AS A PLUS!"

One boasts some 540 shops as well as entertainment and food courts. Central World has several large department stores and many recognisable shops from London westend. The cinemas and games shops may not be quite so useful but the food courts are clean and smart. They provide a cost effective and easy way to eat with good hygiene and also safely away from the street. The Sky Rail runs by the shopping malls and they have large car parks attached. We stayed at the Centara Grand Hotel at Centre World which I have also reviewed and would recommend. They certainly know how to shop in Bangkok but don't forget to bargain."

If you look for something specific, you might spend a lot of time before finding it.

So for example I can order my Thai food and my friend can get her Japanese and we can sit & eat together. But when every restaurant has a door and its own sitting area you can't do that.

There are personal care stores inside the shopping mall like Watsons & Boots. I often walk to Isetan next door to shop as it's easier to navigate there. Central World Plaza is too big. You can cross the street to shop at BigC, a much cheaper supermarket but product quality is low. It's also near Pratunam so if you want to walk, walk to Isetan direction (away from Siam direction) and walk straight further about 20 minutes. Many buses stop here. If you go by skytrain, go out at either Siam or Chidlom station and need a good walk on the skywalk (quite a long walk, between these 2 stations). No subway station is near there."

In terms of its size, it is on par with Siam Paragon.Next to it is the Centara Grand at Central World. This is one of the busiest shopping and tourism areas in Bangkok.In May 2010 it was one of a number of properties, which were set on fire following local anti government demonstrations. Since then, it has risen from its ashes like a Phoenix and it looks smarter than ever. Branded good can be found here but personally other then window browsing, I enjoy coming here to eat. Wherever you happen to turn to, there seems to be a place where you will be able to buy food. The choice is so wide that if you had to visit each outlet and eat at least 20 items from its menu, it would probably take you years.Even if all you wish to do is window shopping, this is one place to visit. The nearest BTS station is Chitlom but it can also be reached by the Khlong Saen Saep Express Boat, which stops at Pratu Nam pier, only five minutes away. Try it, you are bound to find something that will suit your taste.Times of operation: 10:00hrs to 22.00hrs"

Central World plaza is central to a number of shopping plaza's and easily accessed by the Sky Train. Very large and impressive with a large number of excellent food courts - particularly the supermarket area.You will find everything you wish for with floors themed to a particular product category - all furniture on one floor etc. Try the smaller shopping centers in the area around Central World Plaza for whole floors packed with small stall holders with everything you can imagine. Central World is more upmarket. Recommend you start off there, then leave and explore several blocks around for a range of market stalls to top of the range shops. Be prepared for a full day and look at the tourist maps closely. Beware of Tuk tuk's - best advice is not to even bother and that's from locals as well. We are sick and tired of constantly being ripped off, dropped off where we don't want to go because we refuse to be taken to their discount petrol stops, tailors etc. Walk or take a taxi - and even then insist on the meter being on or get out. If you get ripped off or the price suddenly changes when you get there - just pay the driver what you had agreed and walk away and disappear into the crowd"

When I visit them, and I often do, I marvel at the people patronizing them, as I realize that Thailand is not nearly as poor as it appears to be on the outside. Nowhere else, in my opinion, is the vast divide between the wealthy and the poor displayed so starkly as in the massive shopping malls of Bangkok. You will not see poor people in them. Even the older ladies who clean the bathrooms continuously all day long, they are a step up, perhaps, from the truly poor. They may not be able to afford to eat at Sizzler, or at Fuji, but they are generally not living in tin-roofed shacks in the Klongtoey slums. Let's list the malls. There are several off the Siam SkyTrain station. Siam Paragon. MBK. There is another whose name I cannot recall, but where I go on occasion, because there is an Outback Steak House there. There is the old Emporium, off the Prom Phong SkyTrain station. This is the grand dame of Bangkok malls, as it was the original deluxe mall with ridiculously expensive shops with bored shop girls in them because their target demographic was so small. There were not, for many years, that many filthy rich people in Thailand. Increasingly, there are. Otherwise, how could so many new and more massive malls continue opening? The Emporium is still well worth visiting, despite brutal competition from other, new malls, mostly because it is more convenient to people living along upper Sukhumvit, and because it is probably the best venue for girl-watching in the entire city. Believe me, I am a connoisseur of the Thai female of the species, and there are more of them to be seen and met at Emporium than anywhere else in Bangkok. You can also do your grocery shopping there, eat at some decent eateries on the sixth floor, and check email over a coffee at Starbucks. The one of the two newest malls to open in Bangkok is one more SkyTrain station down at Asok. Terminal 21 is not much in terms of a mall, in my opinion, but it has the best location in the city, bar none, residing at the nexus of the SkyTrain and the Underground lines. It makes a good spot to eat. Or to go to the movies. One of Terminal 21's great claims to fame are the Japanese toilets. I have no idea how long that the management expects them to continue working, but these are computerized toilet seats that enable you to push buttons and direct gentle streams of water at various sections of your posterior anatomy. So, there is no sanitary hose at Terminal 21, but they have something else, which is a good substitute. Terminal 21 makes a good central location in the heart of the city to relieve yourself. The next newest mall is Central Phra Ram 9. It is right off the Phra Ram 9 Underground station, and you can walk directly into the basement level of the mall directly from the station. It is very convenient. This mall is massive. It has two huge floors of restaurants. It has movie theaters. It has shops that will take multiple visits to explore. It is so stupidly huge that you wonder how it can possibly be profitable, considering all of the other competing malls in the city. It is directly across the street from the Fortune shopping center, which is a sort of IT venue. There is another venue opening up, but it is not clear whether it is yet another mall or an office building or both. It is right up the road on Ratchadaphisek road, off the Thailand Cultural Center Underground stop. It is called Cyber Tower. I have no idea what is going on there. It is right across the street from another shopping complex with a Robinson's Department store at its heart. Also at the Thailand Cultural Center stop is the Esplanade Shopping Center. This mall is smaller, it is very convenient to use, and it is steps away from the Underground station. It is a good spot to go to the movies. This brings us to Central World. Again, it is a prototypical Thai mall. It is gargantuan. It would take a week to survey all of the shops. It has innumerable restaurants, including one very popular spot where a flat-rate buffet (330 baht?) entitles you to infinite trips to the bar. This is a very good find for those of us who like to eat. The food is not the best, but it is ok. It is simply cheap. It would be possible to go on and on in increasingly microscopic detail about Central World, but it would be pointless. If you have seen one Bangkok mall, you have seen them all, in my opinion. There is no real compelling reason to favor one over any other unless it is because you are geographically closer to one. They all offer parking. Indeed, it is not uncommon for people to park at one of the malls, and then just leave their car there, while they use mass transit to run their errands about the city. Bangkok gridlock is impossible. You must use mass transit, taxis, and motos, to get around. I highly recommend never using a tuk-tuk. They are not required to use meters, and they are often very adroit at quoting absurd prices. You will certainly get a better deal, and safer, more pleasant transport, taking a taxi. If sucking exhaust fumes and getting overcharged appeals to you, then by all means, take a tuk-tuk. If you know where you are going, and you know what you are doing, and you are relatively close to your destination, take a moto. Hope that this helps. Enjoy."

Anyhow, the most outstanding trait of this one-stop mall is its touristy vicinity. Within walking distance, you can reach other enormous commercial complexes, such as Siam Paragon, Gayson Shopping Center, Big C Supercenter and Isetan. Still, you shall be more impressed and interested in the shopping street in front of the Central World building whereat hordes of unique souvenirs, inexpensive clothing and local snacks are ready to amaze your Thailand excursion. What is more, Central World is conveniently neighbored with numerous public transportation stations which are bound for Chinatown, Victory Monument and Khao San (bus), for Chao Phraya River (sky train) and for international airport (express train at Siam station). A stroll to Bangkok, be it short or long, should be tagged with Central World to sightsee a real pulse of vibrant Thai life."

This is good bad I expect. You can always find what you are looking for but you'll pay a price. You can usually find the same thing out in town at a fraction of the price. But they have made it convenient, one stop shop, movie theaters, food mart, restuarants and your dept store items."

Here is where you go to see important holidays and shows. They do New Years eve and Christmas like no one in Bkk. The two shrines are also really cool. I think one is considered the shrine of luck and love, You can spot it by the 1000's of roses around its base. The mall itself has hosted many different events including auto and bike shows. I had a good chuckle when they had the anime convention out front. They also have ice skating. This is not a fancy ring and has more ruts than the Oregon trail but it is SE Asia so the bar is not set too high. Down the street from Central world is Patunam and Pantip plaza both are great places for the budget shopper if Central world is too pricey. Across the street is Big C <I would not suggest shopping their unless you want to take a tuk tuk tout to get out of the place> The most important thing to remember about this area is the traffic direction. 4 lanes traveling away from Sukumvit 1 lane going towards Sukumvit. There is a canal taxi stop under the bridge and a BTS stop located two blocks in any direction on Sukumvit. I prefer to walk through the luxury of Grayzors to the Chit Lom BTS<Left on Suk>"

My Thai wife seems to favor Siam Paragon when she is serious about buying clothing for herself, but Central World is a more frequent pit stop for lunch when the family is making a shopping trip downtown. My impression is that Central World has a wider range of restaurants and a bit cheaper prices than Siam Paragon. Going to the movies is cheaper in Central World, too. The drawbacks are more difficult access from BTS Skytrain, a more limited choice in international luxury brands and that the toilets are harder to find.Personally I find Central World less crowded and roomy than Paragon, so it is a nice air-conditioned break from the hustle and bustle of downtown."

We prefer the walk from Childom station because of the better view it accords: you pass by the Erawan Shrine to your left, for one. The place is massive with 7 floors to capture your fancy. My friends and I shopped a lot at Uniqlo, the Japanese clothing brand which I liken to Gap. I had my best facial ever (I swear, and I am into facials), at Takashi.

With deparment stores at each end and hundreds of small shops in between, there is a great variety of goods and services available. The one big problem is figuring out where you are and how to get to where you want to go. It is a challenging maze to navigate and really easy to get turned around and end up at the opposite of the place you wanted to go. Maps are available on the Internet and printing one before you go will be a big help."

We always stay in the Ploenchit area next to Central World, which anchors Isetan and Zen. the front area always seems to have something or the other going on as evening descends. Free Concerts, bikeshows, stalsl, you name it, its on.There is a nice place to sit down on right (in front of Zen), near the intersection just under the Sky Walk where you can watch the fountain change colors. My kids find it a Riot ! Zen opened up a few months back. We like checking it out. One of our favorite places to eat is Sizzlers on the 7th (or is it 6th ?) floor. Get there early for dinner. We always have to wait a bit but its worth it. Bad salad bar for the money you pay. After the meal we head upstairs to catch a flick. Great theaters - comfy seats and good pop corn. There is a Toys R Us in Central as well. So, its hard to get out of this buidling once you enter it. I like the other large store that anchors the building on the right, Isetan. A bit pricier but carry's quality name brands ... Not the crap you find flooded in MBK ! Central World has it All !"

Located with an indirect walkway connection to both Chitlom and Siam Sky Train stations it is easy to get to. It has a wide variety of mid range and upper range shops both local and chain. The food area is particularly good with many different styles of restaurants and food presentations. The two department stores - Zen and Isitan - are at each end of the long mall. A new hotel is part of the complex for those who don't want to spend too much time getting down to shopping. For those who want to look at the brand names but buy the no-name stuff, the Pratunam shopping area is almost next door with its buildings full of bargains in clothes, leather goods and bags."

While both places allow you into the lounge 1 hr prior to the commencement of the movie, first class @ central world (SF) has a club lounge concept similiar to what you find in the club floor of hotels. The one at paragon was just a nice regular lounge. Food offered was more extensive at the first class lounge ( mini buffet) whereas we were served cookies and cupcakes at the paragon. First class @ central world also took our order for coffee or soft drink and pop corns (complimentary) which was served during the first part of the movie. This feature was missing at the paragon. (think you need to pay for it if you want it). In terms of comfort and sitting, both cinemas are about the same except with the quilt at the paragon providing more warmth compared to the blanket at First class."

There are sakura, and also Ding Tai Feng. Prices for beef noodle is 240B and wanton soup is 215B. Xiao Long Bao cost from 195B to 245B. So do remember to bring extra cash there. In the 5th day in Centralworld, I have went to the Japanese Restoran which is opposite of Ding Tai Feng, opposite of Fuji Restoran. There are no service charge, and the food there ranges from 5 to 10 Sing dollars. QUite nice and delicious."

If you are looking for good quality souvenirs at affordable price, head to Naraya at Ground floor.

They have an ice skating rink inside, movie theaters, a grocery store, lots of restaurants. There is shopping for everything from mobile phones to furniture. You can buy western brands and locally made Thai goods. This is a big fancy, modern shopping mall. I recommend the restaurants in the Atrium section - some great food is being served here. Better than you would expect in a shopping mall.Don't try to take the elevator - you will be standing there forever.Do take a good long look at the map - they only put maps at the entrances and it's a long walk before you will see another."

Before you take the time to visit, specifically ask your hotel staff or knowledgeable locals if it is even open / safe. I tried to check before this visit, but could not get a straight answer online.My first visit was in October 2009. Overall very impressed by its wide open spaces, trendy shops, and great restaurants. Isetan department store looked perfect on both visits. Great source of Japanese gifts, Japanese restaurants, and a pretty complete Japanese supermarket.It is a few hundred yards from Siam station on the BTS SkyTrain system. There are armed Thai soldiers at the Siam station, but I did not notice any others at adjacent stations. The Royal Thai Police HQ is directly across the street from the mall. That explains why the protestors concentrated at that location, and the mall was just an easy target.Felt perfectly safe and would recommend the mall to friends and family visiting Bangkok. There is security checking bags at entrances. Of course, check the local news and avoid, if there is any mention of any trouble."

WTC is set in a great shopping location so I would only spend a day looking around as some floors are all household items like furniture, etc... Food is usually ground and top floors.A great feature of WTC is usually the weeks around Xmas and New Year when there is a bar festive outside, very western in style. Been there twice for this and loved it completely; sitting there outside after a days shopping, in the heat with a cold beer listening to a band on stage whilst watching English football live on Boxing Day is an example of the pleasure available!!!Great for pushchairs, though didn't use lifts but assume good for wheelchairs. Currently undergoing large scale building work (due to complete 2006) so many shops closed or reduced in size, so until complete may disappoint.M&P&K"
