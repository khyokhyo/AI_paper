His knowledge of the history, culture, geology, politics and environment of Cape Town and South Africa is truly astounding. We spent two days with Clive exploring the city. Included in our tour was a trip up Table Mountain, a walk through the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve, a visit to the Simons Town African Penguin Colony, a wander around the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens and much more. My husbands love of photography was nurtured by Clive who knew exactly the right places to get the best shot. He is a genuinely lovely man with a great sense of humour and a passion for his country. We will most definitely return to Cape Town and will certainly be booking Clive again"

Clive has tremendous local expertise making the best use of our time, by avoiding traffic jams and anticipating the weather on Table Mountain. His knowledge of his country's history, his insights into politics and his happy and outgoing disposition were impressive. He gets our highest marks!"

We only had a limited amount of time in Cape Town and had a lot we wanted to see so after reading great reviews about Clive I thought he would be the best way to see everything. I sent him an email with all the top priorities and he made it possible to see all of them within 2 days. He knows exactly where and when to go and is very relaxed and easy going. We couldn't have been happier. The first day he took us to Table mountain and a tour around Cape Town then we had a good lunch and met up with Godfrey who took us through the Langa Township. We enjoyed our tour of the city and couldn't have been more grateful for Godfrey' s tour of his hometown and how welcoming the children and people of Langa were. Our 2nd day we drove down through Chapman's Peak and went to Cape Point. We were able to see some great animals, took a gorgeous hike and enjoyed a great lunch at Harbor House. We ended the day watching the penguins and visiting Kirstenbosch. I couldn't have imagined doing all this without Clive, he was a great guide and we really enjoyed spending our time with him! The best way to see all of Cape Town is to hire Clive!"

Clive gave us the very best personal attention and was always pleasant, patient with our endless pictures, and so knowledgeable! He took us to all of Cape Town's famous sites and managed to do it so we encountered few tourists and tour busses. We visited top boutique wineries for tastings (Rust En Vrede, Uva Mira) which we had to ourselves. Had lunch with amazing views off the beaten path (Harbour House, Graff Estate in Stellenbosch), and hiked up Table Mountain on a less traveled path which avoided direct sun, wind and tourists! Clive's collegue Godfrey took us to visit the Langa township. He was like the mayor and known by everyone! We actually went inside some of the homes and saw first hand the harsh life that people have to endure, shared home brewed African beer, and even visited local schools where we could contribute food. An amazing experience! Clive tailors his tour so you get the best experience possible. He was always on time, had a comfortable SUV (with waters and snacks if needed) and he was a great person to get to know. I highly recommend him and Godfrey for a phenomenal experience!"

His historical knowledge of the city is so captivating as he travels through the streets and tells you all the information from beginning to end. He was so attentive to our whole family and made every outing a blast. We did a Tour of the City, Cable ride up Table Mt. for a magnificent 360 views!Then off to Cape Point, Cape of Good Hope & Cape Maclear and walked along trails near the edges with boulders and fantastic vistas! We ended up at Boulders Beach to see the penguins. Clive made all our excursions so smooth and entertaining. We also really loved seeing the Vineyards in Stellenbosh. It made for a relaxing and super fun day tasting delicious wines. Hope you have the pleasure of meeting Clive in Cape Town!"

We were especially impressed with how Clive asked us about our interest, then researched options for us and filled the days with surprises. Also important was keeping us safe, like telling us about the best/safest banks for ATM's and neiborhoods to avoid. Clive even introduced us to an artist on the rise where we met at her home and ended up buying a spectacular canvas.Clive st the base and expectations for the rest of our trip"

He was better than that, he was informative, fun and really efficient. His goal was to make sure we saw the sights and enjoyed ourselves which we most certainly did. He provided us with memories that will last a long time! We went down to the Cape of Good hope where we enjoyed a short stroll around the coastal path to enjoy beautiful sea views and appreciate the lovely coast line at the tip of the cape. Following that we visited Boulders Beach and the wonderful penguins. It was great to see how they are being conserved and encouraged to breed whilst getting great views of them waddling into the sea and protecting their nests and babies. After that we had a superb lunch at the Harbour House restaurant overlooking the sea at Kalk Bay, with Clive who was good company. I then enjoyed a paddle in the sea whilst watching out for sharks. Time then to pop into another wonderful vineyard Steenberg to sample yet more wine.I can highly recommend a day or more spent with Clive being transported in the comfort of his Land Rover. Book him! You wont regret it."

We booked a private wine lands tour and the tour to Cape of Good Hope.Both tours Clive picked us up in a great 16 seater air conditioned bus with guide and driver. The winelands tour was fabulous - as my group love their wines Clive selected 3 wineries that reflected a great range of wines - La Motte, Hidden Valley where Clive organised a fun private picnic lunch with our tasting and the amazing Rustenberg who specialise in superb red wines. We also had time to visit the beautiful town of Stellenbosch. Clive is a very informative guide with a great sense of humour - my group were very impressedThe next day we were off to the Cape of Good Hope which included stunning scenery and a great walk then off to Harbour House for a superb lunch. From here we modified our schedule and Clive reorganised the day to take us up Table Mountain. He was very accommodating to our needs.I would highly recommend Clive for any touring you need to do in Cape Town - he is very professional and knowledgable abut above all he makes the tours very enjoyable.Thanks Clive for the fabulous 2 days - Tony is still craving more Rustenberg Reserve!!"

Clive and Godfrey provided better tours than we could have imagined! (Godfrey provided city and township tours, Clive took us on the Cape Peninsula and along the Garden Route.) We gave Clive our timeframe and examples of our interests, and he created the perfect trip for us. All of the sights, lodging and restaurants he planned were wonderful. They even managed to incorporate some unscheduled activities along the way as they got to know us better. You can tell that Clive was a teacher prior to this career, because he knew so much about the history, flora, fauna, and culture of the area, and happily answered any questions we had. Godfrey knew everyone in Cape Town and helped orient us to the city, local history and people. We appreciated Clive's and Godfrey's expertise, helpfulness and fun conversations. We did not have to worry about a thing, so we could just enjoy our vacation!"

Having sought out Clive via the internet before our travels, we had discussed our overall travel plans from start to finish. He was excellent in his communication before our arrival, day of arrival and throughout our guiding experience. To note, he is extremely flexible and understanding of the types of activities we were interested in, catering it to fit our desires as well as our individual capabilities (i.e. hiking table top with a 65 yr old and 26 yr old). We had the best of every type of aspect from the hike, to the historical backgrounds, to the recommendation to drive on our own to the cape peninsula and explore towns along it and then wrapping up with a guided tour through the vineyards with one of the most exceptional lunches and views i have ever experienced.Clive catered to our interests with ease and his positive attitude made the entire experience even better. He has a casual attitude with humor and an extensive amount of knowledge that enables you to gain a deeper understanding of all of the places you visit. 100% across the board, would absolutely recommend and book again if i'm lucky enough to find myself there.Thanks, Clive!!"

He took us to see penguins, wine tastings, champagne tasting, we spotted a whale even though it was supposed to be to early. We went Great White shark cage diving and then to Table Mountain and the ariel cable. Godfrey took over for the last couple days and took us around Cape Town, Cape of Good Hope, had authentic South African food with a local band (delicious) and into the inner city. It was a beautiful stay and would recommend these men to accompany anyone throughout Cape Town and the surrounding area. Thank you Clive and Godfrey!!!"

We started with a half day tour hosted by Donna, a colleague of Clive, as we knew we could not check into our hotel until later in the day. Donna took us on a tour of Cape Town and area and gave us our tickets to Robben Island for the next day. We were unable to take the gondola ride to Table Mountain because it was in the clouds. On our own, on Sunday, we toured Robben Island (we recommend exploring the harbour area before or after the Robben Island trip).On Monday with Clive we visited many of the sites on the Cape Peninsula (much to see) and enjoyed an excellent lunch. We had let Clive know that we enjoyed sea food and he took us to a great place at a fish market.On Tuesday we visited wineries in the picturesque areas of Stellenbosch and Franschhoek. We also explored many points of interest (other than wine). We also had another great meal at a restaurant which Clive recommended. Determining that Table Mountain was clear, Clive took us up. His experience proved valuable as he advised us on where to stand in the gondola for the best view (it rotates) and how to negotiate the line-ups. We highly recommend Clive, as he demonstrated the knowledge to customize a tour to suit our interests. We enjoyed his company!"

We got to the Cape and Clive guided us through a short (30 mins or so) climb, where we saw some fantastic views of the Cape of Good Hope, My partner had to face his fears and Clive was very patient (more than me!). We also visited the Penguins, Clive had made a great Lunch reservation, and then we headed off for the botanical gardens. We probably wouldn't have visited the gardens on our own, but it was great! Its a fantastic example of Fynbos Vegetation, along with the Cape Floral Kingdom. Clive was very knowledgeable about the local vegetation. In Summary:Well Organised, Extremely pleasant and well informed Guide, Very Welcoming, Extremely personal service, Great Car! The Best Private Tour we did during our Holiday in South Africa. Make sure you ask him for some restaurant recommendations, as we tried one of his suggestions in Cape Town and it was a great meal! Nice to get off the tourist route."

From first contact, until the point that I left Cape Town, I had complete faith in Clive and he was so organized (that's really important to me). I did some volunteering in South Africa and I wanted to visit the Garden Route and Cape Town in a safe way also to reassure my parents. I looked on Tripadvisor and Clive had great reviews, so that's why I contacted him. He reacted quickly on my e-mails and together we made an itinerary completely fine-tuned to what I wanted.And the whole experience really lived up to my expectations! Clive knew so much about the history of the country and could tell me fun little anecdotes during the drives we had to make to get to our destinations, he arranged wonderful accommodations, he (partially) reassured me before doing my bungee jump (of course I was still a bit nervous when I jumped) and I can give so many more great/fun/wonderful examples. What also was really good about Clive, is that when my shark cage dive got cancelled because of the weather when we were already almost there, he immediately suggested three alternatives in the neighborhood that we could do instead. If I would have been on my own, then that would have been a lost day. Clive did not only meet my expectations, he definitely exceeded them! I would recommend him to all my family and friends!"

Did a initial-day touring by going to South Africa's first \"Township\" where Blacks were \"placed\" in the 1920's. Clive had an expert, Godfrey, from this community to share understandings and that unique, sad history. Next it was a wide variety of stops in the Central Business District, then to the scenic overview and finishing with the cable car ride up to the dramatic top of Cable Mountain. Wonderful!! Clive is very skilled, knowing and sharing. Cannot ask for a better experience and such great skills, love of Cape Town!!"

            "review": "Doesn't get better than Clive. If you are currently researching whether it\u2019s worth it to hire a private tour guide for your visit to Cape Town, much like we did prior to our visit, let us assure you that it most definitely is and you will not regret your decision to hire Clive as your guide. As if the 200-something other 5 star reviews aren\u2019t enough, we have created a TripAdvisor account and are writing our first review because we feel so strongly about our experience with Clive and we want to delve into what makes the experience so exceptional. We have broken down what we think are the 3 most important aspects in considering a tour guide, not only in South Africa, but for any trip. These 3 aspects are: Planning, Logistics, and Execution.Planning: Like many, we wanted to have a hassle free and seamless trip to Cape Town as this was a completely foreign country and continent to us. We contacted Clive in March of 2015 for our honeymoon trip in January 2016. This was the proper amount of time for Clive to put together and book a very meaningful and engaging itinerary for us within our cost range. Of course, payments and coordination with someone internationally may be intimidating, but Clive was extremely responsive and transparent when it came time for payments, bookings, itinerary, questions, and other arrangements for our trip. We did some preliminary research on Cape Town and provided Clive with some activities we were interested in doing during our trip and also asked for his input as well. He sent us several very detailed itinerary options and we settled on one that met all of the activities and sights that we wanted to experience. We are not exaggerating when we say that he did not steer us wrong once. The best example of this is that when we built in only 1 day for a local safari trip, he strongly suggested 3 days in a location outside of Cape Town. We deferred to Clive\u2019s discretion and once we arrived at the safari it quickly became apparent how correct he was. Clive handled all of our bookings for the trip, and he was extremely flexible when we had any changes that needed to be made (more on this later).Logistics: Clive had all of our flight information and was at the Cape Town airport as soon as we collected our luggage and took us from the airport to our hotel. Having someone waiting at the airport for us was a welcome relief after a long trip to a new continent, country, and city. But having someone as warm, welcoming, and upbeat as Clive really provided a level of comfort that allowed us to kick back and start enjoying the trip minutes after arrival. Clive reviewed our itinerary with us on the way from the airport to our hotel and was promptly there each morning to greet and guide us for that day\u2019s activities. Clive came ready with water and various supplies that the activities we were participating in that day called for. Whether we needed a taxi, uber, entrance fee, toll fee, dinner recommendations/reservations, or other admission, Clive handled it all for us so that we could have a hassle and stress-free experience. He had purchased all tickets ahead of time, so we spent no time waiting in lines. One of the best examples of the logistics was during our safari trip. Even though Clive did not join us for the safari portion of our trip, he still booked our flights and transfer connections to the safari (Shamwari), checked us in for our flights on each end (and met us at a restaurant our last night to personally bring us our printed boarding passes despite having severe food poisoning/stomach flu!), coordinated directly with Shamwari to make sure that we had our boarding passes for our plane ride, our transfer from the airport to the game reserve, and all of the necessary documentation and logistics back from Shamwari to the airport when we were done with our 3 days.Execution: Clive is extremely good at his job, whether it requires him to be a travel agent, teacher, guide, driver, or friend. The entire trip he was all five. For two people who knew next to nothing about South Africa prior to our arrival and never once picked up a guide book while we were there, we now have a meaningful understanding of the history, economics, geography, and demographics of the country thanks to Clive\u2019s incredible depth of knowledge about everything Cape Town/South Africa. He is so engaging in his explanations that lengthy drives to wine country or other attractions flew by. There was never one time where we doubted Clive\u2019s guiding. He was very open and honest with what would be accomplished each day, and gave us additional options if time allowed for it. Clive was also extremely flexible with the itinerary. If we expressed interest in a particular location or activity he mentioned along the way, he would do everything in his power to accommodate the request. This is one of the biggest advantages to having a private tour as opposed to joining a large tour group. Clive\u2019s ability to pivot and adapt to a new plan was incredible. This was most exemplified when our Shark Cage Dive was cancelled due to unseasonably cold water and a lack of shark sightings. Naturally, we were disappointed to hear this news, but Clive quickly found a new activity for us and arranged the booking without hesitation. Our substitute activity ended up being a horseback ride along a beach with stunning views of the water! Additionally, Clive quickly refunded us the admission for the shark cage dive without us even inquiring. Clive is as good a tour guide as they come. Every single day of our tour he went above and beyond our expectations. One night we got lost walking to dinner (despite Clive giving us detailed directions from our hotel) and ended up in a less-than-desirable area. When Clive heard this the next day, he took the time to personally do a walking \u201cdry-run\u201d from our hotel to the next night\u2019s restaurant to make sure we did not get lost again. Our safety and comfort were very much his priority, always ensuring we were not carrying any valuables outside the hotel, coming with us to withdraw cash from ATMs, and providing guidance about how to avoid tourist traps. Clive provided a level of comfort and security you don\u2019t often find when traveling internationally. He inspires confidence in a very understated way and is very good at reading situations, giving us plenty space and privacy to do our own thing, but was always nearby if we had a question or problem. There was never a time where we felt like there was a chaperone on our honeymoon. The entire trip it felt like a good friend was showing us around. This was especially so when one afternoon Clive surprised us with a bottle of champagne and two glasses to celebrate our recent nuptials. Clive was the difference in taking our South African honeymoon from good to excellent. We really saw this when we encountered other guides later in our trip. Even though those guides were nice and knowledgeable, they were not Clive, a fact that we could not ignore. So, if there is anything negative to say about Clive it\u2019s that he ruins your ability to ever have another tour guide again. We highly recommend Clive to anyone looking to visit Cape Town. It is money very well spent!"

Cape Town Tour Guide Company excelled at customizing our South African experience.

Admittedly a new strategy for me, this did not disappoint - Clive, and our two-day tour of Cape Town, were simply amazing. From the get-go, Clive was tuned in to our interests. Based on our initial email exchange, as well as a short phone conversation, Clive put together an itinerary that not only covered the essentials, but also took into account the individual interests of each of the four of us in the group - my husband, 2 grown daughters, and myself. He quickly caught on to our personalities, likes and dislikes, and was stellar at tweaking the itinerary to appeal to each of us. At times we ventured off the beaten path, finding craft beer tastings for one of our daughters, artisan chocolates for another daughter, and affording us what seemed like royal treatment at the Ernie Els Winery. Clive's restaurant recommendations were spot-on, and perfectly aligned with our taste and style. In sum, Clive is incredibly knowledgable, personable, and responsible, and we couldn't imagine a better way to experience Cape Town."

One of the reasons you might turn to a guide like Clive, as opposed to a big group tour, is for the personalization, the warmth, the ability to roll with the punches and adjust the tour to your needs and desires and to the unexpected events of the day. If this describes any of your criteria, I can attest that Clive possesses all of these abilities and more in spades.On the morning of our much-anticipated tour of the Cape of Good Hope with Clive, my husband broke his toe in the shower. Only, we didn't know that he broke his toe. All we knew was that he was clearly wounded and that I didn't seem to be able to address the wound properly in the hotel room.When Clive showed up promptly at the time we had arranged, I explained the situation and invited him up to the room to take a look and see what he thought we should do. He took one look, said he thought we needed to go to a hospital, and that he knew the one to go to. In less than 10 minutes, we were in an ER being attended to, and Clive was in the waiting room making alternate arrangements for our tours, which we still thought might happen later in the day. Clive continued to make plans B, C, D, and E, while evaluations were made, x-rays were taken, and then, finally, a decision was taken: my husband needed surgery. There would be no afternoon touring. Even then, Clive stuck with us, taking me to a nearby restaurant to pick up lunch to go -- and even as we went, he was trying to fit in a little tour guiding, telling me about the old Dutch city hall and the Boer war.At this point, of course, we let Clive go, but he offered to come back and pick us up if we were released before 6 (which was incredibly sweet, but we left the hospital after then and took a taxi back to the hotel), and then he continued to check in several times via email. The hospital that Clive took us to, by the way, was incredible -- my husband was evaluated, in surgery, in recovery, had physical therapy, and was back in his hotel room, all in about 10.5 hours. We couldn't have gotten that done in the U.S.To top it all off, Clive made reservations for us to take a tour of the Cape the next day with another company, since he was booked. This is clearly a sterling human being, a truly kind and caring person, and a tour guide beyond compare. I would recommend him to anyone, for anything, at any time. Thanks, Clive -- I very much hope we can come back to Cape Town and take one of your more usual tours some time!"

I personally really wanted to see a seal (or sea lion, technically),so Clive went out of his way to make sure we had the best chance to spot some. He avoided the touristy areas and it was fab. We really, really enjoyed our time on the tour and it was one of our favourite days of our trip (we were on a tour travelling all over South Africa for 3 weeks). We couldn't ask for more from Clive and would definitely recommed him and the company. He was approachable, thoughtful, professional and organised. If you want brilliant service and exceptional knowledge of Cape Town and the area, animals and plants that live there, then Clive is your man! Thank you so much Clive, you made our holiday!

Clive is deeply informed about every aspect of his beloved South Africa, and he is willing to speak frankly, sensitively and empathetically about its history and its passage from the trauma of Apartheid to a democratically elected government. His passionate commitment to the beauty and achievements of this country, and his balanced yet optimistic belief in its future are infectious and reassuring. Clive willingly addressed a multitude of issues raised, recommended further revelatory reading and was keen to ensure a sympathetic understanding on our part.At all times Clive was flexible in accommodating our many requests and individual needs. He was a charming and friendly host. I have travelled widely and have always enjoyed the benefits of excellent guides, however, Clive was more than a guide and teacher to us. Indubitably, our experience of South Africa was enhanced and intensified because of Clive. Simply the best."

He was exceptional as a tour leader and guide, focused every moment on making the trip educational in the highest degree, as well as extremely pleasant and comfortable. We were all impressed with his knowledge of the country, its history, geology, and archeology. Best of all, he is a delightful person with a great sense of humor and fun. We spent time in Capetown and Johannesburg, with a marvelous stop at a wilderness retreat called Bushmans Kloof in Cedarburg where we explored a number of rock art sites. I cared less for the city Johannesburg, but valued the visits there to the Apartheid Museum and the Evolutionary Sciences Institute at the University of Witwatersrand. We spent a fabulous last day at the cave of Sterkfonein. Be sure not to miss the wine country of the Western Cape, especially Jordan Winery where we had a delightful lunch.Bring cameras, good walking shoes, layering of clothes for change of weather, and, importantly, the appropriate converter and adapter for electric devices."

When we arrived we found him to be personable, warm, professional, organized and thoughtful. He was knowledgeable about the politics and history of this complicated and evolving country. I cannot recommend anyone more highly. When we needed to make a change in our plans, he was immediately on top of it. He followed through on every detail. When the weather did not cooperate, Clive adapted seamlessly. He and his associate Godfrey made our trip extraordinary. Godfrey took us into Langa township, where he grew up, and showed us both the problems and promise of his country in a way we would never have understood without him. We took this trip with our two sons, 18, and 20, and all four us enjoyed our time with Clive and Godfrey. In different ways they both enhanced and enriched our experience in South Africa."

We not only saw the wondrous sights of the Cape of Good Hope but we had a fantastic conversation that ranged from the simple and silly to highly interesting. His work with educational groups is obvious through his passion for South Africa, its geography, its animals, and its people. Clive also has a great sense of humor which can be attested to by the way he happily took photos (including a selfie with our camera) and the way he suggested shots of our nephew's Flat Stanley (American book/project that teaches geography). Finally, his desire to learn from his clients (we traded book ideas) makes him one of the best, if not the best, tour guide we ever had. We highly recommend Clive.

This year while visiting the cape yet again, we decided to invoke these fading memories and perhaps reinvigorate them a little by once again embarking on a similar tour. However, second time around I didn\u2019t simply want us to retrace our steps verbatim as having previously experienced the well travelled, popular tourist route, I now had a good understanding of what we had liked about the trip back in 2007, what we hadn\u2019t enjoyed as much and more importantly, how we felt it could have been improved upon. As they say, hindsight is a wonderful thing. Therefore I set about searching for a tour guide who could offer a greater degree of flexibility in designing a more bespoke itinerary that would suit us better second time around. Clive is very much that guy. A very impressive and yet laid back and personable individual who via a serious of back and forth emails prior to our trip commencing, came up with exactly what I asked for in my brief. I decided to arrange the tour to be on our last day of the trip. Our flight home from CPT wasn\u2019t until 6pm that evening and therefore keen to avoid the perennial final day holiday blues where counting the hours is akin to watching the sunset fade into darkness I thought this would take our minds off of the inevitable. That morning Clive picked us up at 8am from our hotel in Camps Bay in his top of the range land rover (nice touch) and we set off on our varied and predetermined route on what was to become a wonderful experience and a fitting way to end to our holiday. As he dropped us at CPT airport we felt we were saying goodbye to a friend rather than simply a tour guide. In my opinion you would be in safe and very capable hands if you chose Clive to make arrangements for your trip. He has certainly cornered a niche in the market with his ability to custom design itineraries as to the clients wants as opposed to simply rolling out the tried and trusted. It\u2019s no surprise that a section of the business relates to him extensively designing whole 1-2 week itineraries for clients perhaps not as confident as we are in doing so independently. However the fact we only booked him for one day didn\u2019t diminish this level of professionalism, focus and/or attention to detail he gave throughout the experience. I can give him and his company no higher praise than to say if we were looking for a guide in the area to take us on a day trip in the future he would be my first choice and if I was looking for an agent to arrange a more extensive itinerary for say, my parents, then Clive would be the first one I contacted."

We spent a day visiting Cape Town, a second to Cape Point and the third in the wine country.We had read many very positive reviews on Clive and so were anticipating well planned and executed tours. However our time with Clive turned out to be far better than expected.As most folks have stated, he is a terrific tour guide. But, he is also very flexible, willing to adjust to our occasional idiosyncrasies while maintaining a very pleasant style (and a super sense of humour).If you are looking for an outstanding tour guide in this area, do your self a favour and contact Clive."

Clive met us on arrival at the airport and looked after us so perfectly for our entire stay. Clive's team offer the total package - extensive local knowledge, attention to detail, flexibility, professionalism & punctuality - all delivered in a fun relaxed style. We spent a full day touring Cape Peninsula taking in the beautiful Chapman's Peak drive, saw the Penguins and enjoyed some wine tasting. The next day we were blessed with spectacular views from Table Mountain followed by a city Tour and ended with a visit to Robben Island. Everyone loved Cape Town - thanks to Clive and all at The Cape Town Tour Guide Co. We'll definitely be back !!"

He showed us all of the Peninsula in one smooth and well curated loop. He stopped at many points along the way so that we could take scenic photos (and see a whale!) and he shared stories about the various beaches, neighborhoods, and architecture. He managed to get us to the Cape of Good Hope sign before the throngs of tour groups arrived. We had it all to ourselves! Knowing the area well, he suggested we take a short hike up the cliff for the best views instead of heading to the lighthouse with the masses. On the drive back around the other side of the Peninsula, we stopped at Boulders Beach to see the penguins and grab a quick lunch at a local cafe. He offered to take us to a nicer restaurant but since I'm an active foodie back home in New York, I wanted to focus my time and budget in South Africa on the scenery, animals, and local wine (i.e. things I can't get at home). Little did I know he had such excellent restaurant recommendations. He later emailed a list of his picks. My advice is to listen to his advice. After Simonstown, we stopped off at Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden. Clive The Professor continued to teach us about South Africa and its history via lessons in flora. All very interesting! He really knows his stuff. To top off the day, we swung by a wine farm in Constantia. I'd already spent 1.5 days in the winelands of Stellenbosch, Paarl, and Franschhoek but I think this was my favorite tasting stop. On the way back to our hotel, Clive took us to the local shopping center so that we could get a few things. He didn't need to do that. His guiding duties were done but he went out of his way just because he's a good guy. We really enjoyed our day with Clive. Seeing Cape Town and the Peninsula through his eyes made us fall in love with the city. It's now my favorite of all the cities I've visited. Clive taught us a lot about Cape Town and was a great person to spend several hours with. Great sense of humor! We had fun getting to know him and hearing his life story while learning about the history and beauty of Cape Town. It's clear that he loves his city and loves sharing his knowledge and time with travelers. He made sure we experienced the best of the Peninsula while avoiding tourist traps. He's a trustworthy expert. He seems to be very busy with several big projects these days so if you're able to grab one of his free days, consider yourself lucky. We were! Thanks, Clive! You're the best."

During all that time, Clive provided personalized service, remained flexible (and patient), and allowed us to add an additional stop (his suggestion, Kirstenbosch Gardens, worth the time). Although we struggled with punctuality, he remained pleasant and helpful. Throughout the time with us, Clive demonstrated a wealth & depth of knowledge. On the day we traveled Cape Point, he took us to the less populated Cape Point area, and met us at the other side, allowing us to hike across the point. He stopped for us to see baboons and ostriches along the way. He took us to a terrific seafood place in Kalk Bay (Harbour House). We saw the penguins at Boulders Beach. We saw all the major sights (we'd already gone to Table Mountain the day before - we knew we could get up in cable car because not too windy, if we'd waited, wouldn't have been able to go, but he had planned to take us there). Again, Clive made sure we knew of the wind issues, and suggested we take the cable car ride if available. He correctly guided us on that one. On the day in wine country, he took us to 3 separate wineries for tastings. All were beautiful and scenic. We stopped in Stellenbosch for lunch allowing us time to wander. He even made us our own little Braai in Franschhoek. He drove us in his Land Rover, so accommodations were comfortable and clean. Clive put up with and answered all our \"stupid tourist\" questions about the land, people, politics, & geography. Highest recommendation for Clive."

From the first inquiry to Clive via email; I knew we were making an excellent travel decision. I knew this was someone we could trust with enhancing our experience. Clive brought our experience over the top, it was spectacular!! The professionalism was obvious before we even met, and wow! Clive is a down to earth, personable individual who is extremely knowledgable and passionate about what he does. He is the best and coolest history professor we've had . Learning about South Africa and having some first hand accounts was priceless. Clive made sure we had the best time ever!! Words are not even enough to describe how very elated we were to have chosen The Cape Town Tour Guide Co. We didn't feel like we were driving with a tour guide, Clive will quickly connected to the personalities, and we were touring with a friend. My husband had left his jacket behind and Clive did not hesitate to offer his. A thoughtful tour guide? Yesss Although Clive was not available for our first few days of tours, he made sure to send a welcome via email upon our arrival to Cape Town. He checked to make sure we were having a great time. Our guide Rudi was an extension of Clive. When Rudi arrived to pick us up in the early mornings; we always had the most pleasant greeting and we just knew it's going to be a great day. There wasn't a question he couldn't answer and we appreciated the vast amount of knowledge imparted to us. We felt very safe with Rudi as we explored all the places we did. I have to point how he seemed to just enjoy us enjoying ourselves. We had so much laughter. From the breathtaking heights of Table Mountain, Cape Point , Light House, to the treasured opportunity to experience Robben Island, Langa Township and District Six Museum we came home \"richer\". There was never a dull moment. Clive and Rudi thank you so very much for the best vacation ever!! I wrote 2 previous reviews and lost them to computer crashing; I think I'd written a book haha! I realize I don't have to say too much. See for yourself. Clive will go above and beyond to ensure a safe, pleasant and super enjoyable experience. For example, we'd book our shark dive separately ( before booking with Clive) but asked Clive to extend his services to transport us to and from Gansbaai. Clive went further with this request, he liaison with shark dive company and how awesome was that. Indeed, Clive and Rudi completed our South Africa experience."

As a former teacher, he has the knack to engage his clients in continuous learning experiences. As a single traveler, I appreciated his ability to focus on my interests and to expand my understanding of this beautiful area. He added extra surprises during the five days that we traveled together: a traditional 10 course lunch on the beach, a traditional African dinner that he prepared for me, and magnificent photo opportunity stops. In addition to the above, he is an accomplished photographer and offered suggestions to improve my photography skills. As a \"backseat\" driver, I felt safe at all times as he drove hundreds of kilometers taking me on many adventures. One last comment: he is a creative thinker! We were waiting for a sunrise at the Cape Agulhas lighthouse but the cloud cover remained. When I accepted the fact that we would have only a \"moonrise,\" he jumped out of his Land Rover, and used his iPhone light to simulate a \"sunrise.\""

To make the most of our limited time in Cape Town, and based on the reviews on TripAdvisor, we contacted Clive at The Cape Town Tour Guide Co. to arrange some guided tours and are thrilled that we did! Clive promptly responded to our initial email inquiry and offered us several options for private all-day tours during our stay. We elected to spend two days touring with Clive and his colleague, Godfrey, and confirmed our arrangements two months before we arrived in Cape Town. On our first day of touring, Godfrey picked us up at our hotel and took us on a \u201cCity and Township\u201d tour that included Table Mountain, Signal Hill, the city center, the Jewish Museum, and at our request, a bicycle shop (we\u2019re both cyclists) to pick-up some South African cycling jerseys. After lunch, we visited the District Six Museum and then took a drive out to Langa, a historic Black African township where 50,000 people live in an area of one square mile.Without a doubt, the township tour was the most fascinating part of the day since it exposed us to the reality of what daily life is like for a large number of South Africans \u2013 something that you really can\u2019t understand or appreciate by just visiting the city center and the usual tourist sites. In addition to a visit to a local pub for some \u201chome brew\u201d with men from the township, Godfrey also arranged for us to visit the apartments of some of the township residents as well as a local community center that provides classes and employment opportunities, including a pottery workshop. Our time with Godfrey was not only fun and engaging, but informative and eye-opening as he took special pride in sharing with us his extensive knowledge of Cape Town and the township where he grew up, still resides, and is greeted warmly by seemingly everyone.On our second day of touring, Clive met us at our hotel and we set out on a tour of the Cape Peninsula. During our drive down to the Cape of Good Hope along some truly scenic routes, Clive shared with us some of the history of Cape Town and South Africa and we discovered a common interest in cycling. Our trip back included stops in Simon\u2019s Town to visit the penguin colony, Kalk Bay for a tasty seaside lunch, Constantia for a wine tasting at the Groot Constantia winery (South Africa\u2019s oldest), and Bishopscourt for a tour of Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden. Considering that we had opted not to spend a day touring the wine lands near Cape Town, visiting the winery was an unexpected treat.The highlights of the day for us included visiting the penguin colony and encountering other wildlife, including a troop of baboons, in the Cape nature reserve. While our time with Clive was spent visiting somewhat traditional tourist sites, it was no less enjoyable or informative than the time we spent with Godfrey. Clive is a very knowledgeable and personable guide and he did a terrific job of showing us what the Cape Peninsula has to offer and spontaneously adapting the tour to our requests and preferences.Clive and Godfrey are both knowledgeable and personable tour guides. They\u2019re a terrific team and you won\u2019t regret booking your Cape Town tours with them!"

Clive was a most knowledgeable and friendly guide not only to Cape Town itself, but to so many areas between the city and the Cape of Good Hope. In addition, we were faced with weather that was not the best, and the way they were able to change on the fly and adjust our itinerary in the short two days we had was really remarkable.

We researched private tour guides extensively on TripAdvisor and decided on The Cape Town Tour Guide Co. I sent Clive a long email telling him a little about myself and my husband and detailing our interests. He responded promptly, and told us what was and was not feasible for our very short two day stay in Cape Town. I was impressed because it was very clear to me that he had taken the time to read the email and set up an itinerary based on this. Since we were interested in touring a township, he sent his partner, Godfrey, to take us around. Our tour with Godfrey was by far the best tour that we had in all of South Africa. He and Clive set up a perfect, whirlwind tour for us, and it was quite apparent that they care about what they do. Godfrey was extremely knowledgeable and excited about his city. And he made us feel very comfortable and welcome. He also went out of his way to assist us with some short-notice airline tickets (which we realize that he did not have to do). Before we met Godfrey, we sere worried because we had a late night flight into CapeTown and were concerned that no one would be waiting for us at the airport. To our relief, Godfrey was patiently and prompltly waiting for us in the arrivals hall. He took us to our hotel and got us settled in. And he was waiting in the hotel lobby for us bright and early the following morning. We did an all day City/ Langa Township Tour. We even drove out to the Kalk Bay Fishing Village and had lunch at one of the local restaurants. It was raining all day and too overcast to see or visit Table Mountain; however, the next day when we were on the way to the airport, the sun came out, and we saw Table Mountain in all of its glory. Godfrey was kind enough to pull off the road so that we could take pictures. However, the absolute highlight of the tour was the Langa Township. My husband and I love to interact with local people when we travel, and thanks to Godfrey, we had a splendid time \"hanging out\" in the Township. Godfrey still lives in the Township, so he took us all around, introducing us to his friends and giving us the history. We went to a pub where the men socialize, and homemade beer is served. A large bucket of the stuff is passed around, and everyone drinks from the bucket. I was a little hesitant, but my husband jumped right in. He entertained the men, and brought the house a round of beer (it only cost about $2 US). This was his favorite part of the tour. He was laughing and joking with the men (and flirting with the barmaid) and having a wonderful time. Thanks to Godfrey, we have such fond memories of that day.Thanks to Godfrey, when it was time to leave, we knew that Cape Town was one city that we would visit again in the future (we travel extensively, and there are very few places that we both agree that we must see again). And in keeping with his great sense of hospitality, Godfrey didn't just drop us off at the airport, he got us checked in and walked us to the security line to make sure we did not lose our way.I cannot say enough good things about The Cape Town Tour Co. Finally, I must add that although we did not meet Clive in person, my husband and I feel like we know him. He is a very honorable person who takes pride in providing excellent service. When we returned to the States, he assisted us with a problem that we were having regarding a transaction that we made with a different vendor while we were in Cape Town. He went out of his way to get the problem solved (although it was not his problem), and he continued to follow up with us until everything was right. How often do you find people like that?If you are ever planning to visit Cape Town, make it your priority to take a tour with Clive and Godfrey. You will not be disappointed!"

I and two friends had just completed an exhausting two weeks of mobile camp safari in Botswana and added 3 days in Cape Town before heading back to the cold Minnesota winter. We couldn't have asked for better guides than Clive de Bruyne and his associate Godfrey, to bring the history, culture and natural beauties of the Cape to life for us. Clive was especially wonderful in that he took great care to be helpful to us where the terrain was especially difficult for our physical capabilities. I would not hesitate to recommend his services to anyone interested in visiting Cape Town and the surrounding sights."

Clive contacted me back very quickly after I initially emailed him. I told him what I wanted to do and he and Godfrey took me to every place on my wish list and more. We learned so much about Cape Town, South Africa and of the people that live there. We also had a wonderful experience visiting the Langa Township. And folks...if you go..bring some school supplies for the kids in the kindergarten. we got to meet a lot of the people and Godfrey took me into a local \" bar\" run by two women where we had a nice time with the patrons. it was an experience that will never be forgotten.Clive went out of his way to take us to wonderful places, great restaurants and went above and beyond the call of duty as we drove around looking for a specific candy that was requested back home. We also had some great whale watching...they just knew where to \"look\" and we found them.So, I just wanted to share this experience with all of you since I get so many of my travel ideas from trip advisor."

My wife and I and another couple travelled to Cape Town on 31/7/2013 from Australia and experienced the professionalism, humour, knowledge, friendship and personalised service from Clive at The Cape Town Tour Co.We contacted Clive in 2012 and from his prompt and well worded email reply,we were confident Clive would live up to the reviews we had previously read in Trip Advisor. I recommend readers contact Clive well in advance of travel to assure them of his availability as he is in high demand.We had arranged for Clive to meet us at the airport and what a delight to have a smiling reception by Clive and to be driven to our secure accommodation at Lawhill Apartments in the V & A Waterfront.Over the next three days we received personalised tours to the Stellenbosch Wine District with wine tastings at Ernie Els and Hidden Valley Wineries, followed by lunch at Delaire Graff Estate Restaurant, followed by shopping for the ladies and the Franschhoek Motor Museum for the guys.The following day, Clive's business partner, Godfrey took us on private tour of Cape Town, including the District 6 Museum where we learnt about the victims of the apartheid era and the forced removal through the racially divisive Group Areas Act. This was followed by a visit to Langa which was a suburb established and designated for Black Africians before apartheid. Godfrey was born in Langa and was able to show us Community Projects to assist the locals who live in impoverished and cramped 'shacks' and often three and four families in cheap unit dwellings.In saying that just about everyone, especially the children had a smile and seemed happy in their environment.This was followed by a drive to Signal Hill and a pleasant hour or so wandering through the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens.On the third day , Clive drove us via Chapman's Peak to The Cape of Good Hope where we went on a 4klm but pleasant walk along the cliff coastline before visiting a Penguin Colony followed by lunch at Harbour House Restaurant, Kalk Bay.Clive also collected us in his luxury 4WD on our departure from Cape Town and delivered us to the Rovos Train for our onward journey.A big Thankyou Clive and Godfrey for making our five day Cape Town visit a lasting memory.Sel and Jill HardyGold Coast Australia"

Form our first email \"interview\" with Clive, we were convinced he would be able to satisfy our requests for our time in Cape Town. There were 3 couples traveling together all arriving at different times (and days). All the arrivals were met at the airport and brought to our hotel (Victoria and Albert) in a comfortable Mercedes van by Godfrey, Clive's associate. We had requested several activities including strenuous hikes up Table Mountain and at the Cape, ocean kayaking to visit the penguin colonies, and bicycle touring in Stellenbosch. Clive arranged and participated in all of these. Other highlights of the time here were a trip to Robben Island, impressive wine tasting (that included chocolate pairings!), and a personal tour of Langa Township with Godfrey. My wife's birthday was the 2nd day of our visit, and Clive arranged a surprise birthday party at a beautiful vista precisely at sunset with wine and unbelievable cupcakes. From beginning to end, pick-up to drop-off, our Cape Town experience was seamless. Thanks to Clive and Godfrey we will have many fond memories of Cape Town."

Stopped at the Cape of Good Hope, Simon's Beach, had a lovely lunch at a seaside restaurant and headed back to the city. On the way back he took us to Kirstenbosch Gardens because he knew my mother had a interest in plants. He gave us a private tour of the gardens and pointed out many of the area's native and more interesting flora.We have a lovely visit to Cape Town and I would recommend Clive's services.

From the outset, Clive's communication over email was great, and he answered all my questions thoughtfully.

I will credit him for making the sun shine when the rain seemed impossibly imminent ;). It was great to hear his perspectives and he did well to keep us on schedule without making us feel rushed... It is a pretty full day tour, after all!We spent the next day with Clive in the wine country. He selected a couple great vineyards to visit. What I appreciated the most, besides his informative and easy-going nature, was his flexibility. You can tell he really wants the trip to be tailored to your own interests. He truly went above and beyond, however, at the end of our day when he suggested we try to get up Table Mountain on the way back to our hotel, knowing that the weather had spoiled our plans a couple days earlier. After racing up the hill to get us there just before the cable car closed for the day, he patiently waited while we experienced a spectacular sunset from atop the mountain. I can't thank him enough, as this is one of those memories I will always cherish, and the resulting photographs will hang on my wall for years to come. While he could easily have headed home on time, Clive voluntarily extended his day for our benefit.

Having experienced Ernie Els Vinyard on the Winelands tour of 2011, I asked Clive if he could get me a case of \"Big Easy\" which he had ready for me when we arrived. This time we repeated the Cape Tour and also asked Clive to organise a Great White Shark cage diving trip at nearby Gansbaii, the world famous Shark Allley. This was the highlight of the holiday - the kids are still buzzing about it 2 weeks later! Clive takes the time to understand you and what you want from your trip and never fails to deliver, always exceeding your expectations. His knowledge and his enthusiasm for his country and its history, warts and all, will inspire you to return. Be warned though, he also has a wicked sense of humour. Don't fall for his baboon stunt on the Cape Tour like I did, much to the amusement of my family!! The dive team he used were the best available and the restaurants he selected were excellent. Clive is ably assisted at CTTGC by Godfrey. It was Godfrey who took us cage diving. Godfrey is also excellent, he comes from and still lives in a township just outside Cape Town and he compliments Clive perfectly. The story of when he met Nelson Mandela in his township was truly inspiring.

Every detail of our day trips (including: the wine country, Robben Island, Cape of Good Hope, tour of Cape Town and environs, Table Mountain, Kirstenbosch Gardens, District Six Museum...) was covered. We simply showed up and enjoyed every minute. On our last day we had arranged a tour of Gugelethu, and Godfrey joined Clive for the tour. Godfrey's experience and knowledge of the townships provided us with much information about the history, as well as present life, in the townships. I know I speak for our group when I say that we would highly recommend Clive as a tour guide... he loves Cape Town and South Africa and you will too!"

Roelf was a delightful guide and great fun to be with---not to mention being extremely knowledable about the region, particularly the flora and fauna. He let us set the pace, spending more time at places that interested us, less at places that didn't. Our tour was the day before the 35,000 rider Cape Argus bike race (which Roelf was riding in by the way) so there were literally thousands of riders out on the roads the day of our tour. Thank goodness he was driving--no way I could have done it myself. Anyway, kudos (and a strong recommendation) for Roelf and the Cape Town Tour Company!"

Many of them were provided by the excellent tour guide services provided by this company. We had Yolanda as our primary guide and Godfrey for the tour of Langa township. Yolanda is very energetic and informative. She took us on the Cape Peninsula tour and then on another day to the wine country. She has a terrific sense of humor and is very adept at dealing with people. I had a blast with her. I am not always the easiest person to please as I have strong opinions but she was absolutely game for the task,.Godrey was hired to take me and my friend through the Langa township. He is a resident of the township which gives him entree that you won't find with other guides. He is serious but fun and managed to give us a full history of the township in a matter of a few hours. We met a few locals and visited a kindergarten class full of the sweetest children you could meet. This is a first class operation."

We met so many nice people on beautiful wine estates, they all gave us a very warm welcome, that was really great. A special thanks to Silke, our german tour guide, who also did a fantastic job.

I booked the Cape Town Tour Guide Company for two full days of touring for myself and my friend. On the first day, we met with Clive De Bruyne. First, let me say that Clive is just an all around nice guy. He is very pleasant, professional, mannerable, and extremely knowledgeable. Clive knows a lot about Cape Town's history, geography, government, culture and economics. He was eager to share his knowledge with us and we took it all in!In all, we traveled along Chapman\u2019s Peak Drive and came across several groups of wild baboons, visited the Cape Point Ostrich Farm, took a 45 minute hike at Cape Point itself, viewed penguins at Boulders Beach, and toured and walked Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens. In the middle of it all, we even managed to have a quaint lunch with Clive at a superb restaurant with excellent food and a stunning view of the ocean.On the second day, we ventured off with Godfrey to the District 6 Museum and then a guided tour of the Langa township. This tour was intense and enlightening. In Langa, we visited several homes, a local pub, and took fruit to children at a local school. We walked around, while Godfrey gave his insights about township life in general, as he is a resident of Langa. We ended the day with the best meal I had during my entire visit, lunch at the Lelapa Restaurant in Langa. Absolutely delicious food with a huge variety of dishes - while listening to a live marimba band. It was absolutely perfect!Clive and Godfrey get nothing but praise from me. Five star service. Highly recommended!"

Once in email contact, his quick, efficient and informative replies to my queries and demands was exemplary and I felt confident we would be in good hands. I had warned Clive that I am very demanding and my restricted mobility might cause us some difficulties during our tours. During our three full days of tours, Clive anticipated every obstacle for me and tailored every excursion to suit my needs perfectly. Not only is he extremely knowledgable about the history, flora and fauna of the region, he is remarkably intuitive when it comes to his clientele. He found us some lovely restaurants for lunch as well as wonderfully uncrowded locations to stop for photographs along the routes. Best of all, he took us to a charming winery on our wine tasting tour that specialises in matching wines to Belgian handmade chocolates - at this point, I ran out of superlatives to applaud his tour planning skills! The tour of Langa township with Clive's friend Godfrey, whose Mother still lives there, was truly inspirational. I will go back again when we revisit. There is so much there to see and to experience, one visit is never enough. Quite simply - if you want a first class tour guide, Clive and his team are unbeatable. The best compliment I can pay them is to say thank you so much for everything and we'll be back!"

As an American i knew a little about apartheid but knew nothing of the lasting impact is has had on South Africa. On the drive in from the airport you will see the townships but unless you book a tour and spend a day you won't really know anything. So after shark diving, table mountain abseil, and a tour of the cape we had a cultural day in the townships, sure I remember the other days but it is this tour that will stick with me for the rest of my life. We met Clive and our guide Godfrey at the hotel and we were excited to set out. You will be immersed in the township, walk the streets, meet the people, see what life is like. At first I was picture happy but soon put the camera to my side and spent my time talking to the people. Handing out candy to the kids (an absolute joy and must bring tons of candy the kids have literally nothing and it was a so rewarding) Also make sure to eat at Mizoil's Meats a gathering point for people from all walks of life.Godfrey thank you so much. This was a day we will never forget. I encourage you to book with Clive and request Godfrey, I encourage you to skip any tour you are thinking about that you can do elsewhere in the world like drinking wine and book this trip. I encourage you to bring stuff to give away to these people. This was an amazing experience and I think you will find it rewarding."

We spent a day with Clive in November 2012 to see as much a possible during our stay in Cape Town and had a fantastic day.We found Clive on trip advisor by chance a couple of week before visiting Cape Town. We wanted to get away from the standard packed tour buses which dash from one tourist spot the next without giving you a real feel for the country and we were not disappointed with the tailored private tour Clive provided. The day with him was very relaxing whilst packing in everything we had requested to see. Clive picked us up from the hotel after an early breakfast to get ahead of the crowds. We took a one day tour of the Cape peninsular taking in Chapman\u2019s peak drive, the Cape Point with a fantastic walk along the cliff tops. We visited the Penguins at Boulders beach and then stopped for a fantastic private lunch at a sea food restaurant with an amazing sea views. We were very impressed with his knowledge of the wildlife, flora and history of all the areas we visited. He was a fountain of knowledge with great tips for things to do and see for the rest of our holiday on a self drive along the garden route.The Range Rover Discovery was a very comfortable, air conditioned and smooth on the steep hills. Clive always positioned us in the right place for the best views along the route ready to stop whenever we wanted to take a photo.Arriving back ahead of schedule toward Cap Town we detoured to visit a Wine estate to sample some of the fine wine available.We would highly recommend his services if you are visiting Cape Town and want to tailor a private tour at a reasonable price."

We also went off the main road for a while on the VERY off chance of seeing a zebra.......no such luck, but we did see ostrich, baboons and a particularly nervous tortoise.We stopped at Kalky's for lunch and I definitely recommend this local cafe, serving fresh fish in many varieties. The calamari was exceptional :)As we were doing a private tour the schedule was flexible, so we certainly didn't feel rushed and had plenty of time to take in the amazing views at every location.We finished our tour with a visit to the Steenbeck Vineyard for a spot of wine tasting.

From the moment we met Clive we felt at ease with his relaxed but professional manner. He was flexible in fitting in all the little extras we wanted - even sitting on the beach for over 2 hours waiting for the sunset so I could get a special photo and the next day taking us to a jeweller so I could buy a bracelet - both of these were outside the tour itineraries. I was more than a \"bit lame\" after my climb of Mt Kilimanjaro and Clive always took this into consideration making sure he dropped us off at entrance gates and then going off to park the car. He also carried my heavy camera backpack without being asked and often took photos of us. Clive's knowledge is extensive and he provides a really interesting commentary - laced with bits of humour. His offsider Godfrey gave us a very realistic tour of the Township and, as we were with a \"local\", we felt very welcome in this community. We have already spread the word by recommending Clive to travellers we met after leaving Cape Town and when we go back there, we will use him again.Ann and Louise, Townsville, Australia"

Although my position as a student on a research trip was different from Clive\u2019s usual clientele of tourists, he easily transitioned his detail-oriented skills to optimize my stay in Cape Town. I had a tour every day that I was off and spent the evenings enjoying his recommendations for dinner and nightlife. From burger joints to fancy dinners, low-key bars and dance-all-night clubs, Clive never missed. Everything he does and recommends is perfect for the individual client because he knows his town and genuinely wants to get to know his clients. On the days I was working (shipwreck archaeology) Clive joined me in the field. His eagerness for participating and learning, coupled with his practical suggestions and willingness to get his hands dirty, easily made him the most valuable addition to the team. It also didn\u2019t hurt that he had connections to local museums. Clive has an easy charm that makes people feel comfortable and safe, backed by an intelligent and extensive knowledge of the area, creating a harmony between tourism and hospitality. His love for the area and culture is so obvious in the way he talks about it while giving tours, and actively seeks to learn more for both himself and his clients. I have a deep respect for Clive in that he appreciates not only the swanky parts of Cape Town, but also the Districts and the Townships. He and his partner Godfrey often arrange for clients to tour District 6 and Langa Township, in order to broaden a foreign understanding that often results in benefits for local orphans and the community at large.Clive became more than a tour guide. He was and is my friend. During my stay he far exceeded expectations, going above and beyond any reasonable call of duty to guarantee I had the time of my life. Clive is a fixture in Cape Town, and it would be a shame to travel there without meeting him."

On our recent trip to Cape Town with a group of 10 people we were met by Clive & Godfrey at the airport and immediately knew we were in expert hands. We spent the next three days touring with them and nothing was too much trouble. The vehicle was modern, comfortable and spotlessly clean. We had a personalised full day tour to the Cape of Good Hope which included a beautiful lunch where we were blown away by a large Southern Right Whale playing with some seals directly out from where we were seated. We then had a lovely stop for wine tasting on our way back to Cape Town. Their in depth knowledge of the local area enabled us to get an up close & personal experience of Cape Town itself, the townships, Table Mountain & Robben Island. They tailored our schedule to include the places & sights we were interested in. They went out of their way to accommodate us and as a travel industry professional I would highly recommend The Cape Town Tour Guide Co to anyone planning a visit to the Cape Town area."

Clive was our guide while we visited beautiful Capetown and in four days of touring we were able to see every aspect of that city and surrounding area with great efficiency and comfort. HIs friendly personality and knowledge of the history and politics of the country made our tours totally interesting and informative. He knows how to plan your itinerary to give you what you like and is flexible in his planning to make the day as perfect as it can be. We were taken up Table Mountain on the perfect day for stunning views of the city. We hiked the South Cape trail and saw Penguins and Ostriches and ate at a wonderful out of the way restaurant and sampled wines he recommended. He got us over to see Robben Island for a very moving look at the troubled history of South Africa. A tour of wine country to his favourite vinyards was most enjoyable and we found his recommendations helpful. A highlight for us was the arrangement he made with a personal friend who lives in Langa Township. We were able to go into the township with Geoffry and see the way the less fortunate citizens of Africa live today but to understand the optimism they have for a better future. After our touring with Clive we had a far better view of South Africa. His professionalism and personality made our time there truly fascinating. Clive gave us recommendations for dining that were all perfect. If you go to Capetown, Clive, can make your time there memorable."

During the week, we had found out about a fellow who has something called a \"Blo-Kart\" on a beach south of Cape Town. As sailors, we couldn't resist the idea of \"sailing\" these karts on the beach but did not have the opportunity to get there to do it. Any how, when Clive picked us up that morning, we told him of our desire to try to do these as well--though the Cape was still our priority. He was happy to help us problem-solve how to work it into our day, confirming the availability and location with the fellow who does this. He had no problem in not making a stop to the Ostrich farm, when we mentioned that we were willing to give it up so as to accommodate the other activity. (In other words, there are no pre-determined tourist stops you \"have\" to make). During our tour, Clive never made us feel pressured, and was adept at finding out what was important to us, and gently reminding us of our time schedule. He was very informative on geographical aspects of the tour, and also provided interesting information about the various animals we saw. We hiked to interesting areas at the Cape of Good Hope, and he hiked half-way with us himself (giving us great information enroute), and then left my husband and I to ourselves. The balance between having a guide, and then some personal time, was perfect. Finally, we did make it to the Blo-karts, as well, and it was a blast! In short, our day with Clive was our best day in the Cape Town area. I highly recommend him to any travelers who are going there. My only regret is that we didn't have more than one day with him --"

His ongoing sensitivity to the needs of each member of the group was remarkable and made our time together harmonious, inspiring and truly delicious. We wish we could have traveled with him forever!!!I give him my very highest recommendation."

Clive provided a fine day touring around, taking in the beautiful scenery of this marvellous part of the world. He knows his stuff, is entertaining and good value for money. If you have limited time it's well worth looking Clive up......and I'm sure his longer tours would be up to scratch too!My photos from the whole trip can be found at http://www.dd1961.com/southafrica"

Our group of 2 US couples in our 60s spent 3 days with Clive de Bruyne touring Cape Town and environs and had an outstanding experience, even as he represents a much younger generation than we. Clive was available, prompt, professional and courteous and possesses a keen sense of humor. Moreover, he is energetic, is an excellent teacher (he was formerly a high school history etc teacher), knows his history of Cape Town and South Africa and offers a nuanced and balanced perspective that was every bit as valuable as the beautiful and interesting sites that we visited. We were confident we were in the hands of a real pro and would highly recommend this individual for all aspects of touring Cape Town."

Our guide was Clive, without a doubt one of the best guides in Cape Town! He has a wide knowledge of Cape town and surroundings, the history,... We visited Stellenbosch with its wines, Cape of good hope with its beautiful nature, Robben Island, Table Mountain, Clifton beach,...He even took us to a township in Cape Town where we had a very intense visit, a real eye-opener and not a place that the average tourist can go to. It was all in all an unforgettable week!"

After reading about the disparity of wealth and the townships scattered throughout South Africa I was interested in this particular type of tour. I had my reservations about it exploiting or being voyeuristic to the township residents, however, Godfrey and the Cape Town Tour Co, provided a very educational and informative tour that eased those concerns as the tour progressed. Throughout the tour Godfrey (born and living in the Township of Langa) gives you personal insights and answers any question that you may have about life in the townships and history of developments, both past and present. His perspective and the tour is something very different than what most travelers are used to when visiting the beautiful scenic Cape Town. It shows another side to South Africa. The real side where the majority of people still live. Truly an enlightening experience."

The natural beauty of the country is evident all around you, however you have to look a bit harder to grasp the cultural beauty. This is why my group chose to do the Township Cultural tour.A group of 29 of us were traveling to South Africa as part of a course we are taking in our MBA studies at Northwestern University in Chicago, IL. We studied the country of South Africa for 9 weeks and then came to visit for 2 weeks. My project group decided to focus our paper on tourism and how it can alleviate poverty in the country. We assessed many aspects of this challenging question, but we also wanted to experience as many types of tourism as we could while in the country (eco tourism with safaris, township tourism, etc.).Taking the township tour was the highlight of my two week trip. The beauty of South Africa truly lies in the people. Our tour guide Godfrey grew up in the township of Langa. He was able to really give us a true insight as to what life is like in the township, the challenges they face, and the opportunities they have to improve. We took an interactive foot tour through the township learning about various aspects of the township. We went to a local 'pub,' (you have to try the beer), we met local entrepreneurs and artists at the community center, saw a typical hostel, learned about how government is trying to revamp the townships, and visited a local school where we interacted with the beautiful children. It's one thing to see a township off the side of the freeway while driving, however its a truly different experience walking through the area and getting the real perspective. As sad as it may make you to see people living in dire circumstances, their positive spirit and joy is undeniable. Being able to have this experience gave me a more realistic view of how much of the country lives and how far South Africa has to go in their reconstruction post apartheid. I understand that many people have limited time when visiting Cape Town, but I implore you to spend the 2-3 hours to do this tour as it will touch your heart and change your perspective on life. I'm glad Clive and Godfrey gave us the opportunity to experience this side of South Africa, and I'd urge any one visiting to do the same."

He did a Cape Town day tour with us and then a 3 day Garden Route Tour. Not only did Clive give us a history of the area, but he carried on interesting conversations with us. This was more like going around with a friend then just a guide. My husband is in his late 70s so was not up for walking great distances - Clive made it easy for us. He'd take us on the walk, then find a cafe for us and then run back and bring the car around. He took us to Dupio Zero for lunch - they have the best Italian food and the most wonderful ice coffee. Be sure to try it.I can't thank Clive enough for making our tours most enjoyable."

Clive was sensational, and without his expertise we would have missed out on many opportunities in Cape Town. On arrival he asked if we were up to going to the top of Table Mountain before checking into our hotel. As we were feeling quite fresh we were happy to, and luckily we had Clive to suggest it, as the cable car was closed for the remainder of our stay in Cape Town due to high winds. His expertise was bang on. Clive took us to every part of Cape Town that was a must, and tailored it to our needs. He even managed to squeeze in a short 45min township tour that I was desperate to experience even though it wasn't in our crammed itinerary. We managed to for into 3 days what our friends did on their own steam in a week. And his suggestions for restaurants and bars was spot on as well. We found his knowledge well rounded and detailed not only on the political history but also the wildlife, flora, and fauna. Do yourselves a favour and book with these guys!

I don't think there was one student who wasn't ecstatic about the background information, tour planning and enthousiasm, offered by Clive! As a personal high point of the trip, Clive arranged a protected tour through the township of Cape Town, following a request of me and some friends.

Although we had crafted a three day \"itinerary\" with him before our arrival, our conversations along the way frequently led us to unplanned destinations, but he never failed to be completly knowledgeable about each new spot, while still managing to keep everything on schedule as though he knew in advance exactly what we wanted to see before we even told him! Handling reservations, satisfying the personal needs of the group, and filling each day with wonder and delight, Clive is HIGHLY recommended for your trip to this beautiful area. Whatever your interests or time constraints, he will organize a special day for you and, in the meantime, charm you with his warm, engaging personality, leaving you with the most wonderful memories of the beautiful Cape area of South Africa."

Our 1st trip with clive was so good(cape point) that we actually changed our plans and booked Clive for a second tour(Champange tasting in Franschhoek area).Clive is happy to come up with a plan for you, but is quite open to amend at the last second if there is something you want to do or see. So don't be afraid and suggest something as this is why a private tour guide works so well. You will travel in luxury, comfort and with one of the most friendly of people you will ever meet. Clive's knowledge is quite diverse from history, food, wine and just general issues that occur in the world everyday. You will not be disappointed when booking Clive, so if u were unsure if to book or not before reading this review then please don't waste your money on someone else. Book Clive now! We only hope Clive is still in the industry the next time we are the Western Cape region or South Afrcia in general as we we book him without out a seconds thought.

Being in Cape Town for a week with family, this is a great escape to the nature and opportunity to see the wild animals in the park!From Big 5 we saw Rhinos, Elephants and Lions (very far). Also other animals there!My son really enjoyed the trip!Great digital booking service! I was browsing yesterday night the website of the park, and got contacted by their Chat. We had a quick conversation, the Agent shared all the prices, possibilities, and got us booked in less than 5 minutes on following morning tour. Was very impressed!We came by our own car, there was a welcome drink and delicious breakfast waiting for us. The drive in the park was fun followed by lunch, and then a nice swim and rest at the pool. Enjoying the experience and this day trip a lot!"

It may not be Masai Mara but do not get fooled by this small reserve as this drive has a lot to offer. We arrived here after a 2 hr drive from Cape Town and were welcomed by a glass of champagne. Before the drive starts you are greeted by the sight of stallions and some peacocks roaming freely. We opted for only the game drive so they start off first with lunch at 1300 hrs and then off to the drive. The buffet spread was delicious and cater to vegetarians as well. The Malva pudding is to die for :) Our guide Kensington was very informative and stopped wherever he could and gave us enough time to click pictures. If you are heading here during September and October please carry warm clothing as there is a lot of cold air breeze during the drive. We saw hippos, Ostriches, Zebras, a mother Rhino with her cute baby, Springbok, lions (males fighting over a female as always :) ), an Elephant trekking down the hill for some oranges (never saw that coming), cheetahs and some members of the \"ugly 5\" as Kensington called it..lol We were as close as possible to the animals and a truly one of a kind experience. This is a must do when you visit Cape Town"

Kensington was a fantastic guide and made seeing the \"big 5\" a very fun and enjoyable experience. Unfortunately at the beginning of the tour, the symptoms of food poisoning began to take hold. I ate the breakfast buffet, which was nice but also pretty basic for luxury preserve standards. I had several of the breakfast meats and fruits. Within four hours, I was completely symptomatic and got sick on the way back to the hotel in Cape Town. I saw two other reviews that mentioned food poisoning. As with all buffet style food preparation, be careful. Hopefully this was isolated to just me today as I am still currently very under the weather."

Couldn't find the buffalo within the allocated time which was all we missed. The Quad bike part after lunch was so much fun and we got to explore much more of the reserve as we could go faster and as such we got to see the giraffe which were not seen in the morning part either.

            "review": "Two day safari. We arrived on a thursday (drove ourselves) and were greeted with champagne and juice before having lunch. Food: The buffet (breakfast, lunch,dinner) was rich and the food tasty. Coffe and juices were included with breakfast but no drinks were included with lunch or dinner. We were surprised how fresh everything was. Different fruit was always available and some of the meat was prepared on request.Rooms: Our room (two single beds) wasn't spacious but then again you don't plan on being in your room anyway. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom clean and shampoo, shower gel and conditioner provided for.Safari: we got to see the big 5 up close which was an amazing experience! The animals looked healthy and cared for and it was a pleasure to watch a mommy rhino interact with her baby.But, one should be aware of the fact that this is nothing like kruger (or any other 'real' national park). The animals roam freely within the area that is fenced off and the lions are separated from the other animals (2elephants,3giraffes,some rhinos,8 hippos and many zebras etc). I like the idea that the lions were rescued from trophy hunting but if you expect them to be wild (they are fed) and free (referring to the fences even though the reserve is huge) this is not the place to go. I am not trying to say that they do not have enough space but if one is expecting natural behaviour by (e.g. hunting) they should reconsider this reserve. I want to stress the fact that the lions (and all the animals in the rescue center) were saved from canned hunting and that they grew up in captivity which led to unnatural obese animals and loss of the hunting instinct. All in all the idea behind the project is undeniably good and you'll be rewarded with awesome pictures.The staff was friendly and always helpful!"

            "review": "We had a great time. We booked for two nights.AccommodationThe first night we stayed in a standard lodge room with no view, and a window that looks out onto the passage (privacy!), and carpark. I was rather disappointed with this room. I do see how it could be a useful room for someone who is there for one night only, as you could be ao busy that you do not need to spend any leisure time in the room. As we wanted some peaceful leisure time, we upgraded to a premium lodge room with a balcony and view. The difference was phenominal. We had a lovely time in the afternoon sun drinking wine on our balcony looking for animals. Very relaxing. The room is also much more spacious than the other room.There is a shared entrance which is not the best. You can hear neighbours in both types of rooms. FoodI enjoyed the buffet style food, especially the breakfasts with fruit (and various ther cold bowl items), cooked breakfast, cheese and preserves, flapjacks/crumpets (pancakes) with dulce de leche, coffee tea juice and sparkling wine.I do think that there is room for improvement for the lunch and dinner.Meats were amazing, but the vegetables for bland and boring. One or two unique dishes would be nice. Overall the food was nice but it could be amazing.Game drivesWe loved the game drives. We got to see loads of animals within the first ten minutes- rhino, elephant, hippo and springbuck. And other animals later on. The guide was amazing. I do feel like this is a large zoo without cages, as the animals are supplement fed which makes it feel a bit more unnatural. The karoo does not provide enough food and water for these types of animals so the human hand is needed, although it is still a good experience. The lions are in a separate enclosure, which I understand as they are rescues. I did feel a bit sorry for them, being fat and lazy and having no reason to exercise. It was still great to see the lions closeup and cageless.The break with sparkling wines and snacks was fun. The evening drive was longer (2.5h) than the morning (1.5) with more animals. Landscape and propertyThe landscape is very interesting. Karoo vegetation and fynbos create a red and arid scape. It's nice to see something different. The property is great. The restaurant is perfectly situated facing the reserve with huge glass windows and a pool. Peacocks rule the grounds :) There is a mix of chalets, lodge (think modern apartment block), and cabins. Most of the chalets face the grounds of the property, the cabins face the reserve (on stilts), and the lodge has rooms that face the reserve as well as back rooms with no view. ServiceThe service was good. All in all, 4 stars as we really enjoyed our time but their would be a few things to improve for a rating of 5. Tips:Pay extra for a premium lodge room if staying for a leisurely and relaxing time. If returning to Cape Town, take a drive through Ceres, Tulbagh and the beautiful Bainskloof pass. "

I count on these reviews for future decisions so I always try to be as informative as possible for others like me, here goes; this place was really well done! Although my room had no view at all, it was clean and well maintained. Bathrooms werenice and I loved the old fashioned skeleton key for the rooms. Pool was nice, too cold for us to do anything more than dip our feet but beautiful to sit around and have some drinks.They have stargazing with a high powered telescope every night at 830 and a bonfire where they bring you marshmallows to roast. Drinks were good and cheap, food was good, all buffet style. You do have to pay for water all the time though (about 1 usd)Now for the actual reason you go here... the game drives!! I stayed for 2 nights so went on 3 drives and they were all fantastic. We saw a ton of animals on every trip. Let me be clear this is a game reserve so the animals are used to seeing the jeeps and definitely not afraid to come close to you. This is NOT intended to be a wild safari. The lions are kept in a seperate enclosure from all the others and fed weekly so they really dont care to lounge around while you drive up to them. It was amazing to watch them so close, they stared right at you intrigued by why we were there. We saw giraffe, hippos, rhino, elephants, lions, springbok, water buffalo and baboons. There is a rehab facility they take you to as well which was pretty nice, nothing dramatic but cool.Service here was impeccable, our driver Vino,even let us get out on one of the drives so we could get closer to the giraffes! They provide everyone with blankets for the morning drives as it is very cold in the open jeeps. The scenery was magnificent too! A few things to know, they have a gift shop with some really nice stuff and it does have an atm should you need one (it didnt charge me any fees to take Rands out), not every room has working charging area but some people I met there simply asked for a different converter and they were happy to help. I had no problem withmy european two prong adaptor.Other guests I met while there raved about the spa which gave massages, facials and an indoor pool. Overall amazing experience would highly recommend!"

We really enjoyed our 2 night stay at Aquila, the game rangers are excellent and very knowledgeable (Hyron in particular was brilliant) and go out of their way to show you as many animals as possible during the game drives. We went on 3 games drives and all were vastly different to the other which is great.The food is fantastic and offered different meals at each sitting.We will definitely be visiting again in the future.One suggestion would be to hold the private drives at different times to the usual game drives, we were disrupted twice during our last drive because of the private safari. Firstly we had to wait for a few minutes right at the beginning of the drive while the private car looked at the elephants (it could have been the car filming with the drone that caused this) and then secondly we couldn't get up on to the lookout point where we had snacks and drinks during the drive the night before because the private vehicle was up there. We ended up having to have our snacks and break right outside the lion enclosure. This was a minor issue however.Overall I couldn't recommend it highly enough!"

Reception was very well organised with welcome drinks followed by a huge buffet lunch. We could only check in to our rooms at 2, after lunch. The rooms were tastefully decorated and had both air-con and heaters. We stayed in the family semi-detached cottages for 2 nights. The room consisted of a four poster on the ground floor and 2 single beds on a mezzanine floor. This was fine with older children, but I wouldn't recommend for younger ones, as the stairs were quite steep. The bathrooms where fine, but hot water wasn't guaranteed. (indoor bath and outdoor shower). The game drives were very good and informative. Do not expect the Kruger! This is a very small reserve, but I think it's great if you want to introduce your kids to the wildlife safari experience. The drives are between 1 and a half and 2 and a half hours long. The morning drives also show you the rescue centre (ARC), which is very interesting. I would say the facilities are better for people travelling with younger children, as teens tend to need more, if it's too cold to swim. Food was great!!!!!! (and so much of it!) Staff were very nice and helpful,"

We stopped in the Mountain lodge room overlooking the swimming pool and also overlooks the game reserve of which the two Elephants are in view of the rooms in the afternoon. If you go to a game reserve make sure you have plenty of warm clothing it can get very cold out there in the mountains you can always take the extra clothes off but if you haven,t got any to put on you wont enjoy it as much they will supply blankets but don,t get caught out. The Safari was amazing withe all the animals Buffalo, Rhino, Lions, Elephants Hippo, Giraffe,and so on. If you stay the food is first class it,s a running Buffet always something to suit everyone and if you have any food allergies or are vegetarian just ask. the drink is sold separate all except at Breakfast time of which you can have all the drink you want make your own bucks fizz fruit juices tea and coffee. If you buy any drinks its that cheap don,t worry about how much it will cost and they run on a tipping system of which its normally 10% of the total but I always give more as sometime you would be only giving a few pence away but its up to you and the service is great and second to none. You can go Horseback or Quad bike safari as well and the trip by car is only about 2hrs from Capetown by road and I am ashamed to say the roads I drove on are a lot better then ours in Britain and also a lot safer I drove for two weeks for the first time there and its was a pleasure to drive. If you want to visit a fare amount of things like we did a car hire is a must but don,t try to drive to much as you will miss the sun and there,s always time to go back another year."

We were told that due to the spa having only been open a couple of months, they were still experiencing teething problems. We were also told that we weren't the first couple to have this problem. Nevertheless, they were able to fit us in then after we showed our frustration. The poor spa assistant was not very well trained in problem solving. The massages were fair.(If you want an awesome massage, be sure to check out Life Day Spa in Crystal Towers Hotel). Just some advice, if you are on the shorter side, like me, ask for a lower locker in the spa locker room. My locker was in the top row, I had to stand on my toes to reach into it. The Spa staff and Manager apologized once again and said they'd organized that biltong and wine would be delivered to our room on check in, at 2pm. When I enquired at the reception at 4pm about the promised goods, a blank look is what I received, I left it in their hands. When we returned to our room after our first game drive, there was champagne and fruit?? This after the Spa Manager asked us whether we'd prefer red or white wine..we had said we would prefer red wine.We had paid extra for a room with a view, the view was nice, just a pity no animals made their way to the watering hole. The decor is tasteful, bed is comfortable, just a pity about the foreign dark hairs on the bed linen...The food is excellent, you cannot find fault with it. Lots of variety, lovely salads and fruit. The downside of the dining experience is having to ask at least 3 times for your slip, even going back after lunch to say that we still haven't received our slip to sign off. We were told the disorganized lunch time was due to staff shortages. At dinner we were given our drinks slip mid meal, before dessert, no pen to sign off. On the game drive, when all 6 viewing trucks are all parked at the elephants, it is very difficult to hear our ranger over the other 5, all talking at the same time. Thank goodness the trucks split up after that but if you want to clearly hear your Rangers commentary, be sure to sit in the front of the truck.Overall, very average. I guess Aquila just needs us all to go visit only once, to make their money. I don't think they are phased about whether we ACTUALLY enjoy the expierence or not."

But considering it is about an hour 15 mins drive from Cape Town and you want to see Big 5 in a shortened period, this should be your choice. The food was good, considering it is complimentary if you are an overnight guest. The breakfast gets a little crowded when the day tour guest arrive. The rooms seemed a little better in the website; they were a little cheaply decorated and the minibar was actually very dirty.

The tour guide was great and took us around to see the animals and provided us with details on the animals that we saw. We were able to see a variety of animals and a lot of them. We saw most of the big 5 animals, the buffalo was being elusive but that is ok. Animals do not follow our desires.I have to say my highlight was the lions and seeing them. We got to the lion area and they were hiding up high on the hill. We were taken out of the trucks and walked to close to where they were. Took our time there to see the lions and they showed off for the crowd. I just loved them.The morning safari drive was nice and I enjoyed that. We went to the rehab area and saw some of the animals there.The food for dinner and breakfast was good. It offered a nice selection of local foods. I had the ability try new things.The room was great. Would have been an excellent view if we did not get there so late (arrived in the room after dark).

I'm in Cape Town on business and had the weekend to kill. My wife who was tagging along wanted to do an overnight safari. I did some research, I wanted something close to Cape Town and that looked nice. I can not express how much my wife and I had such a fun, exciting, and relaxing time at Aquila. I provide my review in bullet points, pros/cons.We avoided the toll roads and took the mountain roads to Aquila, it took about an hour and 55 mins, very little traffic if any. Pros1) We saw wild baboons on the side of the road. Just relaxing, minding their own business, too funny. 2) The Main Entrance was clean, and it screamed safari. 3) Easy parking right up front.4) The entire decor of the main building was nicely decorated. 5) We booked the Luxury Premium Cottage, SO WORTH THE MONEY. It was private, outside shower and jacuzzi. The stone walls, the bed was comfortable, the views overlooking the property, amazing. 6) THE FOOD....I'm an Italian from Brooklyn. I know good food, the food here was A++++. That chicken was delicious. So good I told the lovely waitress I needed to speak to the Chef, delizioso!!7) The staff was helpful and nice. 8) The tour took about 3 hours. We saw lions, hippos, elephants, rhinos, giraffes, and a bunch of little, forgot their name animals. My wife and I got amazing video and pictures. We were 3 feet from the lions, 3 feet. It was amazing! Friend me on Instagram to see the pics and videos, @ \"fuscoooo\". Cons1) Average wifi. Not the fault really of Aquila. There's no fiber in the area, I think. Plus all those brat kids playing Pokemon Go or something...In closing, I'd recommend Aquila in a heart beat. The Luxury Premium cottage is a slam dunk! I DO NOT give an Excellent review unless I'm blown away. Aquila met my standards."

If you stay there go for a room as high up as you can and take binoculars, to get the view of the lake (and animals).The safari itself was ok, our ranger Mike cleverly got us close to the elephants - there are only two. But elephants in any numbers are amazing. I loved the white rhino - there are half a dozen of them. Plenty of zebra, gnu and springbok. It was all a bit artificial though, especially the poor old lions locked in their little valley. Rescue centre has lions and a leopard. All in all a very good outing, and at \u00a360 a head pretty decent value for money (NB we drove ourselves there, this was not a Cape Town pick up). My daughter's fianc\u00e9 loved it."

            "review": "An expensive day trip. A day trip from Cape Town waterfront cost us approximately $500 Australian per person. This price included transfers to and from our hotel by mini bus which was 2.5 to 3 hour drive each way, entrance to the reserve, 3 hour game drive, buffet lunch and dinner. We were the last picked up and the bus was full with 15 of us keen tourist from all over the world. It was fun speaking to them and swapping safari stories. Our driver was nice and drove safely. We did a quick stop at a service station for coffee and a toilet break. The reason we decided to do this day trip is because we didn't get our safari fix in Chobe and Kruger, we wanted to get a closer look at lions and hippos. The expensive price tag made us think twice but at the end of the day we didn't want to leave Africa without these close encounters. Aquila is a private game reserve, but the animal here are not wild, these poor lions have been rescued from canned hunting. They have separate enclosures for the lions an other vegetarian animals and they feed their animals regularly. They also have nearby a rescued centre, a sanctuary for animals with sad stories attached. After having a nice buffet breakfast we were loaded into safari trucks, they are much bigger then the ones in Chobe and Kruger. The tour guide/driver educated us on the animals but we couldn't hear what he was saying, a microphone was needed. We saw up close hippos, wildebeest, zebra, Impala, lions, giraffe, elephants, ostriches. The lions were beautiful but it was sad seeing them so fat with lack of exercise, from my understanding the injection given to them to stop them from breeding causes them to gain weight. We had a champagne drink break in the middle of our drive with zebras and giraffe in their enclosure. I was a bit disappointed we didn't see rhinos up close and no hyenas, cheetahs or leopards roaming freely. There was cheetahs and a leopard caged in the rescued centre, we were lucky enough see them. The game drive felt really fast and there was not much animals to see, don't expect to see big heard of animals. We had fun as it was different from the wild game drives we have been on and this was the first time we got so close to the lions. I can understand why others would be disappointed coming here, it definitely doesn't give you that excitement of tracking and finding an animal. The reserve is beautiful and it had accommodation on site. The price of the tour compared to what you get is not on par, although we did enjoy this tour I would not come here again on my next visit to Cape Town as it was way over priced."

I strongly suggest to anyone considering spending your money on this establishment to rather save it and go else where! Our lodge was a hotel room which half of them were not stocked with all items, not turned down and not cleaned properly. Our treatment at the restaurant was utterly disappointing and not deserved. The only highlight / enjoyable time was the Safari we went on and the time we spent together as a family but we could have saved over R20 000 and gone to a MUCH better accommodation and Private Game Reserve! This is NOT a 4 star Game Reserve!"

The nearest you can get to roaming free wildlife is Aquila, which is a beautiful 2 hour drive from cape town CBD. Its a hotel/spa in the middle of the Karoo (semi-desert), carefully designed to fit the setting and yet provide well appointed accomodation. You can go for a day trip (safari drive + meal) or overnight (3 meals, 2 safaris). The buffet style meals are good and with a wide variety of things to try. there is also a great bar with comfy seats and log fires. But this is all a side show - you go there for the safari drives of course. These are in trucks with about 12 others and a local guide. They last 2 hours or so. The guides are fantastic at spotting the animals and getting up close. Herbivores all roam together in a massive 10,000 hectare space with mountains, water holes and valleys. It was fantastic getting so close to rhino, zebra, giraffe, ostrich, hippo, springbok and not so close to buffalo. Lions are in another huge space and leopard and cheetah separate again. Two unforgettable drives. But dress up warm - it was pretty chilly despite the blankets given out. Other reviews have moaned that the animals weren't all there (err - they are free to roam) or that it was basically a zoo (kinda true, but you don't get that feeling. It was us in the cage, not the animals). If free roaming safai is what you want, go to Botswana.Overall, great trip. Strongly recommend. Take lots of warm things if you go in the winter!"

The 2 hour safari car drive was also very bumpy i kept sliding and jumping out of chair the whole time but there was a safety belt. The guys there did an amazing job welcoming us with a welcome drink and then a large breakfast buffet and a lunch as well after the safari was over. The safari was amazing as you see animals living naturally in their habitats. We got to see all the animals except the lions because it was very cold and windy.

Half way through the safari we stopped by the Giraffes and had more Sparkling wine while we conversed with the other people we were on tour with.we also got a chance to see the great work Aquila does in there Rehabilitation centre (ARC) and then went back to have a superb african themed lunch, all buffet style.

Paying just under R 8000 for the one night we were expecting luxurious accommodations and 5 star cuisine.We received instead very mediocre accommodations, had to ask for the blankets, hot water bottles and hair dryer which was supposed to be in our room. No bottled water provided and no dressing gowns.Food was buffet style and although tasty, it was a small variety and very much like any 3 star hotel buffet. They had no decaf coffee though the manager arranged for some the next morning.Our first game drive was less than 90 minutes and we felt the game warden rushed us as she was cold due to light rain. We did see some lions and zebras and giraffes before she hustled us back.The mid morning game drive the next day was wonderful. Our game warden Godfrey took his time and provided a champagne and water break. We saw 4 of the big 5. He ended the game drive by taking us to the lion and cheetah sanctuary which our previous game warden did not bother with.In my opinion this game reserve is way overpriced for what you get. I would advise finding alternative accommodation in Worcester ( about 40 min away) or Touws rivier and just do a day visitor safari trip to Aquila."

This game reserve is more of an animal sanctuary and some of the animals were actually rescued from harsh conditions so could never return to the wild. Our guide, Abreal, was terrific- he was very knowledgeable about the animals and their habits and entertained us with his stories. Our mountain view room was lovely. The food was served buffet style and was quite good.Sine we did not have a car, we paid for transport. Our driver, Jolene, was great and we loved seeing the beautiful countryside. What I found odd was that upon arrival, we were told we couldn't check in until 14:00 and were directed to go have lunch in the dining room. When I asked about what we should do with our luggage, I received blank stares and a half hearted suggestion that they could keep my luggage by the reception area. I was not happy with leaving my stuff unattended so ended up dragging it to lunch. The next day, we were told check out is at 11:00 and our transport will not come until 12-12:30. So we had to sit around with our luggage waiting. Since Aquilla was responsible for the transport too why couldn't the times for check in and check out coincide with the transport times?"

We were greeted with champagne and drank outside by the pool (which we can swim in before or after your safari, wish we had known!) until the buffet was ready. The food was delicious! Afterwards we hopped onto a truck and went off to see the animals! We drove into the main inclosure of the park and saw zebras, ostriches, rhinos, hippos, antelope elephants and giraffes. We also drive through a portion of the reserve which housed the lions as well, for obvious reasons they are kept separately. We got pretty close to a couple of the animals and we got to witness first hand how fast rhinos can run. They are quick! I didn't expect them to be so nimble of their feet for their size!

When we arrived at the reserve, we had a drink to greet us and a great buffet breakfast that can be eaten at a leisurely pace. At 10 we started the safari - there weren't many people as it was winter in South Africa, so we only had one truck going out.It had been raining during breakfast, but stopped as soon as we pulled into the reserve. We were given blankets to keep us warm and emergency rain ponchos just in case. Just inside the gates, our guide, John, was radioed and we drove over to see two elephants. They were beautiful. We got close to them and John gave us a lot of information about the elephants, as well as springboks and ostriches, which were also with the elephants. We then saw hippos, flamingoes, rhinos (including two babies!!), baboons (which John did not like - he told us they were awful creatures! I got the impression in South Africa baboons are just a nuisance), a giraffe, and a type of antelope that I forget what it was called. We then went into the lion enclosure (they're enclosed as the other animals in the park build up a sustainable population so the lions can eventually hunt them). We saw all seven of the lions they have in the park, two males and five females. They were right next to the truck and it was AMAZING. At around 1, we went back for the lunch buffet which was delicious - I ate everything. There was a lot of options and some great traditional South African food cooked on wood burning stoves. At around 3 pm, we headed back to Cape Town. This was an excellent day trip that I highly recommend!"

The day trip safari includes a welcome drink, lunch (buffet), a late afternoon safari with champagne, bilton, cape dried fruits and nuts, dinner (buffet), accommoation for the night, an early morning safari to the rescue and conservation center and breakfast. You have to pay the refreshments ordered at the afternoon and evening buffets.The buffets had a lot of various foods like salads, vegies, meats, rice and potatoes etc. including desserts of fresh fruits, puddings and cakes with sauces.Breakfast included fresh fruits, toast, various pastries and bacon, various egg dishes, sausages.The late afternoon safari was sensational. We saw all the wild animal up close, except for the giraffs. Just don't forget to take a jersey, even better a jacket and perhaps a scarf for later in the safari. Starting the safari it is very hot, but suddenly around 17.00h it becomes cold, the safari continues until approx. 18.00-18.30h so you will be happy to have the extra jacket.We were lucky to get the brand new room with ensuite bathroom (all rooms come with an ensuite bathroom) The standard or mountain facing suite has only a shower with toilet and basin, whereas the suite facing over the game reserve has a bath also.The mountain facing suite which we booked is really only to be used for showering and sleeping, plus checking mails. If you want to enjoy the evening outside with a glass of wine or you can't go to bed early, then you should book a suite overlooking the reserve, because it comes with a balcony.The morning safari included a visit to the animal rescue and conservation, and a quick drive through the reserve. All-in-all we could get the best photos of wild animals here in Aquila, we had an excellent guide, the food was plentiful, it was clean enough (a lot of people were visiting), it was a good stay."

When in Africa you have to see the famous animals and if you are ok business or on a short schedule, this is the pace to go!only about 90 mins out if Cape Town, Aquila is a great private reserve that has a great selection of animals, great food options, a full bar and accommodation in luxury bungalows if you decide to stay a bit longer!I have taken stage here every year for the past 5 years!Staff are great if you communicate what you want for the experience. You can tour the park and see all the African animals either by the traditional safari vehicle or be a little more adventurous and see the park by Quad bike or even on horseback!!! It adds such a different experience when you are only meters away from an African Elephant or Rhino and are sitting on a quad bike or on horseback!!Staff are great, food is excellent and the experience is priceless!! Well worth the visit!"

We stayed in a beautiful room, overlooking the safari park, and my daughter loved having her own little place in the 'loft' area upstairs. The safari was informative, and the animals were mesmerising, looking content and cared for in their surrounding. And the most memorable bit was waking up in the middle of the night, and stepping out into the open, woken up by the sound of a lion's roaring. It was a magical experience, and one I would recommend!"

We were met with a Champagne reception and whisked through to the dining room for a tremendous buffet lunch. Mounting the purpose built vehicles was easy in the larger ones, but difficult in the smaller. The drivers were very careful over the bumpy tracks, but even so it was wise to hang on. It was no time before we came across Hippo basking in their lake, by which springboks, zebras and elan roamed. Suddenly the rhino appeared.This private game reserve is large enough to give the animals the privacy they need and to give visitors the feel of being on safari. You can try to spot the animals before the guide adding to the authentic feel of the place.There are not huge numbers of animals but those here seem well fed and happy and seem to be living in a fairly natural environment with freedom to roam consistent with visitor safety."

For those who want a real African sampler but have little time to go to the bigger wild life reserves Aquila is the perfect solution!Approximately two hours scenic drive from Capetown this Resort is beautifully laid out with feel of the real African cottages and friendly staff who welcome you with a cold wine or sparkling juice while you check in if staying overnight, this I highly recommend if you have the time. If not then this can be covering in a day.You can drive down with your own vehicle or shuttles from Aquila will pick you from your hotel and drop you back. On the way you might want to visit the wineries surrounded by beautiful mountains or get fruit from the fruit stalls. The resort offers three kinds of accommodation catering for all budgets and tastes.Breakfast,lunch and dinner are scrumptious buffets sure to please everyone.The safaris run in the morning at 6.30 for those who want to kick off early, then at 1.30 after lunch and at 4.30pm. One can see the big 5 and lots of other animals. We were lucky to see Elephants, ostriches, springboks ,rhinos, hippos, zebra, wilderbeast,giraffe,water buffalos and antelope along with many bird varieties with peacocks strutting around the property. There is a swimming pool and bar and a cozy lounge with a fireplace and television for chilling out. Or if you want a camp experience there is a campfire pit.For the more adventurous, an extra experience of horseback safari or quad bie safari is highly recommended. It is a unique and amazing experience getting you so near the wilderness and experiencing the animals from a totally different aspect. You can also zip in by helicopter which is a scenic half hour from Capetown. A must have experience for all ages. I highly recommend this Resort."

Hard core safari goers may frown but hey, they're boring - who needs em. Our 2 nights stay was the highlight or our trip, especially the free horseback Safari we received when we booked for 2 nights.

Therefore, all the animals in the park are fed close to the roads and consequently can be watched at a few meters distance. Impressive had been the number of rhinos ( 5 adults, 3 babies). Rhino-breeding is the most positive aspect. There was only one wildebeest - where in a real safari there are in the thousands and only a couple of antelopes and buffaloes as well as two miserly elephants. Most disappointing was the lonely leopard and the two sickly cheetas in cage-like enclosures. No crocodile could be seen in a swimming-pool like murky basin. In short: It's a zoo with the visitors inside the fence, and good for children watching tame animals at close range. Many \"safari parks\" in Europe are similar. But it had bee a pleasant visit even for us adults: good food as well as accommodation, friendly and efficient service - and pleasant surroundings, especially in the evening. Value for money - as common in most of South-Africa nowadays - had been excellent (price 300.- Euro for two. one night incl. dinner/breakfast) ."

The beauty of Aquila is that, despite it's huge size, it is relatively small in comparison to the more well known safaris. Not that you would ever know. This means that you are guaranteed to see animals in their natural environment without having to drive for hours and hours on the off chance that - for example - an elephant that was in a particular place the day before, might be there again today.I got speaking to the owner of the reserve and even though we were out for hours and saw many amazing animals, we only scratched the surface of what is there. If we get a chance to go back again, I have no doubt we would see even more of the beauty of this place and STILL be guaranteed to see dozens and dozens of animals.Elephant, ostrich, giraffe, zebra (my wife got particularly excited about the number of zebras that we stumbled across) lion (oh boy! did we get close to the lions) hippo, rhino and baby rhino, springbok, gnu/wildebeest and leopard. (Probably more, but my brain is fried from recalling the day)The fact that many of the animals here are rescued only adds to the beauty of the place.The driver/guide was clearly passionate about his animals and very knowledgeable.To round off the day there was then a fabulous meal once we got back to the lodge.This is a MUST visit to anyone coming to Cape Town - even the drive there goes through some spectacular scenery."

I had read many reviews on trip advisor before going and did realize there would not be a huge variation of animals and that it was not like an actual authentic safari experience, but since are time was limited we decided to go ahead and book it anyway. We got picked up in Capetown and had a stunning 2 hour drive down to the reserve. Greeted with sparkling wine and served lunch. The buffet wasn't spectacular and little choice, we didn't know that drinks cost extra so beware of that. The views from the infinity pool were lovely and we felt very lucky to see two elephants walk by in the distance. Our room was simple but clean and nicely put together with a big bath. No tv, and although thats not something we needed, we were disappointed that the wifi was very very poor. We got ready to leave on are afternoon safari, unfortunately it was not very well arranged and about 100 people had to stand around 1 man with a clipboard telling you what bus to get on. Yes I said bus... No safari jeeps but big open busses that seat about 30 people. Hardly intimate but we didn't really mind as we were so excited to see the animals. We were taken out and saw the same 2 elephants almost straight away and got great pictures, but as the safari went on we noticed that there is hardly any wildlife there at all. You go out in 6 busses at the same time, waiting your turn to be able to take pictures. It's actually a fairly small area where the animals are and it's very rocky and dessert like , no real place for animals to hide so you are guaranteed to see every thing. We saw 1 giraffe, a few springbok, 6 hippos, a few rhinos zebra and wildebeest. No huge hoards of animals, the lions are kept separate and are very fat, so you will never see a lion actually stalking or killing another animal. There was hardly any trees, bushes or anything alive really. We understand that the cape climate is different than up north but it just seemed so barron. We saw no hyena, warthogs, birds of any kind, meerkats , reptiles, porcupine etc etc. They did have a leopard...in a cage, and although we understood that the leopard could not be set free because it had been hand raised, the cage seemed rather small. There was one croc in a very tiny enclosure and two Cheetas. Dinner was once again buffet style and although not bad, you'd expect a bit more refinement from a 4 star hotel and it's not cheap. We hoped the morning safari would be different the next day, it was very cold but we were supplied with blankets and coffee or thee. It was exactly the same as the afternoon tour except very cold and we found it a bit pointless. Overall I personally think that Aquilla game reserve is descent if you've never had a safari before and/or you have kids. Staff were friendly and knowledgable. But we were very disappointed and you would see a much bigger variation of animals visiting a zoo, although I'm not a fan of them. Please save your money and do it right and go on a real safari. We were almost \u20ac600 lighter after just a one night stay and regret not saving up and going somewhere for a real safari experience"

Back at the lodge at 1:30 for lunch after also visiting the rescue center where a leopard and lion were fenced in. On the drive itself we saw quite a few animals even though some of them not too clearly. The lions (1 male and 2 females) were behind an electric fence but we were able to get right up to it to get some excellent pictures, until they came right up to the fence and roared at us. That's when we were asked to step back.This was the first time we saw a group of maybe 7 hippos out of the water. The paths on the drive were very rocky. And bouncing us around. It would be so nice if they could come in with some heavy equipment and smoothe it out some.Breakfast and lunch were included in the package but not drinks with lunch which was unusual.

It's not a true safari, but it's pretty good and it won't take up your entire vacation. The preserve is fenced in and houses free roaming elephants, giraffes, zebra, antelope, springbok, rhinos, hippos etc. they have a number of lions that are in another enclosure within the park that you will also drive through and may be able to the big cats from mere feet away, as we did. They also have a couple cheetahs and crocs located in their rehab area.Our trip included a nice breakfast with champagne and also a nice lunch after the roughly 3 hour safari. The preserve has a hotel and bungalows for overnight guests as well that looked nice. There's a gift shop of course too.You can opt to do the tour via big truck carrying up to maybe 30 people, or by horseback or ATV."

This review will be a positive one but I do understand how others may come to a lesser opinion. As a first trip to Cape Town I'd say do it to check the \"Been there, done that,\" box. Also, lower expectations as the actual reserve , or the part used for the tour, is not very large and the number of animals are sparse. Also, a bit on the pricey side but hey, you're on vacation. This may not sound as a ringing endorsement but as this is how it was described to me by locals before we went, I knew what to expect and rather enjoyed it.  We saw the Big 5 and especially loved it when one of our group didn't listen to Johan and got too close to the fence to view the lioness up close and she lunged at her. The breakfast was good and the lunch was even better. Staff was friendly and attentive. My son enjoyed the dip in the pool after the tour. I vote on the side of with a try."

This is a reserve that is still growing and although they don't have thousands of animals like Kruger, I still felt it was worth every single penny. To start off they picked us up at the exact time they said they would, the breakfast buffet was great, the welcome wine was delicious, the Game drive was fun with a knowledgable guide and the buffet lunch was amazing. If you're looking to see a million animals roaming around, then go to Kruger, but my family and I got to see 4 of the Big 5, and thought it was all really nice! This is ideally for those who are in Cape Town for a short amount of time but still want to get some sort of safari experience."

            "review": "Great for a first time safari type experience. Before our visit I thoroughly researched lots of reviews / the official website and had clear expectations. Firstly, this is no actual safari, it's a game reserve safari experience, but it does give you a feel of what a real one would be like. It's not like a zoo either !! There is a lot of land around the reserve and animals tend to be in the area where they were recently given food or where water holes are, except for the elephants (definitely only 2) and giraffe (approx 5), which wonder around the whole reserve. We still enjoyed getting close up to all animals including the giraffe and elephants along with the rhino, hippo's, zebra, elephants, wilderbeast, springbok, ostrich etc. Our only disappointment was the small amount of land given to the lions, which have to be separated to other animals as they would wipe them all out. Despite reviews saying similar about their enclosure, management don't seem to appear to be extending it, but are extending the hotel area - which is a shame. However, we did see the lions up close and enjoyed seeing them groom each other and affectionately play ( they are still wild so keep on your guard - no hands out of the truck )Accommodation, grounds and food were all great and staff were lovely so couldn't fault anything on that score. There is no champagne as stated in other reviews but staff offer complimentary sparkling wine.Overall, we totally enjoyed the experience and remember what you pay is significantly less than a real wild life safari so keep expectations real.I would recommend it."

            "review": "Excellent attraction - but too much bureaucracy.. While staying in Cape Town this attraction is about two hours drive away. It is possible to arrange for Aquila's drivers to pick you up from your hotel, and drop you back afterwards. The drive to the reserve is very scenic, and is an experience in itself.When we arrived, we were stopped at the gate in our minibus, and made to fill in our details on a sheet of paper, including our names and where we were from. After completing this task, which took some time with eight people filling in details on just one form, we continued to reception. Before we alighted from the minibus, our driver said we had to book in at reception, which entailed joining a long and slow moving queue. When we arrived at the front of the queue we were told we didn't need to book in. Very odd! And a pointless fifteen minutes queuing.From this stage on our experience was very good.We started off with an excellent breakfast, included in the price, which was a wide ranging buffet, with all the choices we could want. The safari started soon after. There were ten safari vehicles lined up, each seating about 20 people in an elongated land rover type vehicle. I'm not sure whether we struck lucky, or whether all safari trips at Aquila are like ours, but we had a brilliant driver, who was extremely knowledgeable, and very friendly. We were in the first vehicle to leave, and one of the last to come back. The trip took us around a large area, with the driver choosing the route. Our driver chose well, because we must have seen almost every variety of animal on the reserve. The first animals we saw were hippos, almost completely submerged in a pool. Then we went on to what for me was one of the highlights, elephants, about ten yards away. We continued round the reserve, visiting zebras, rhinos and various small deer, as well as some large wildebeest. We stopped half way round for a break, and got out of the vehicle. The driver opened a refrigerated container, and produced several bottles of bubbly, so at about 11:00 in the morning we celebrated with this. People who didn't want bubbly had a choice of beer or non alcoholic drinks.After this we went to see the lions. They were contained in a fenced off area, which we drove into. There were half a dozen lions dozing, and no fence between us and them. They must have been well fed. Obviously the lions need to be separated from the rest of the animals, because to them a wildebeest is a nice meal, and the management would certainly not want their stock eaten. But it seemed to me rather contrived to be viewing the lions in this way.We then found some giraffes, remarkably well camouflaged considering they were out in the open.We made quite a lot of other stops if our driver or one of the passengers spotted something of interest. We got back to the base after about three hours.At this stage, lunch was included, which was also buffet style, and was plentiful. There was also a bar where you paid for your drinks. After this we could enjoy the place for an hour or two, using one of the swimming pools or just lazing. Then, when we were ready, we were driven back to Cape Town.I would have rated this attraction 5 'blobs' instead of four if it hadn't been for the annoying procedure at the beginning of the trip.The whole thing cost just over \u00a3100.00. That included everything except drinks. Not a bad price for transport, food, and the chance to view all those animals."

A very nice conservation game reserve - they know exactly how many of each animal they have and separate the lions so they do not hunt the others. The animals are very well cared for and their food is supplemented, therefore they were easily found due to the placement of the food. A wonderful experience to get up close and get amazing pictures, especially for children. Our 9-year old boys loved it. A very well organised experience and our guide was very helpful in answering our boys questions. Travelled in covered jeeps. Tip. Take a sweater as the morning outing and the sun downer were chilly.The lodge where we stayed was very comfortable with a double bed on the lower level with a mezzanine level with 2 single beds. Outdoor shower plus indoor bathroom which was very clean. Nice choice of food on the buffet, but pretty much the same for lunch and dinner.Thanks to Baggy for taking the time to go to the chemist for me to get cough mixture.Only real disturbance was a sanitary towel left by the pool area! We reported it and it was cleared away immediately"

Restaurant is big and not personal, food at buffet restaurant was OK, but nothing special. For a first encounter with African Wildlife and the Big 5 so close to CapeTown it's a nice place, but rather expensive and too commercial. We saw nice small baby rhinos, but very easy to find by the rangers. Some of the animals, cheetah and leopard are in captivity, the lions/lionesses are overfat, never seen this before at an upmarket private game reserve, they are feeded and don't look for a prey themselves knowing they get food from Aquila. The morning drive was a disappointment. Never been at a private game reserve where they do big commercial drives during the day when it's very hot and also the animals prefer to hide from the heath.Although they also care for the animals and do good work I would not recommend this place."

My husband and I stayed two nights in one of their five premier luxury chalets privately situated and built into the hillside of the reserve. The decor was of rock elements, wood and stone - creating a back-to-nature ambience. The en suite bathrooms include; twin hand basins, a toilet, bathtub, and outdoor shower and a Jacuzzi. We had our own private patio but wished it had shade on the on hot summer days. The linens and towels were nice, as were the cozy robes provided. What was missing was the \"privacy\". On three occasions, Aquila staff entered our locked cottage. There are no deadbolts or do not disturb signs. When staying two nights, we chose not to attend every game drive available and they shouldn't assume we were out. On the final morning, a staff member announced himself after letting himself in through the locked door while were enjoying a natural jacuzzi. My husband asked him to come back later while we shielded ourselves under the water - only for him to tell us that he had to \"check the mini bar first\" and he stayed another five to ten minutes! This is totally unacceptable and an invasion of privacy. The safari game drives were wonderful and we highly recommend choosing the guide Kensington Maringwa if possible. He was knowledgeable, fun and very entertaining. We also took advantage of the complimentary horseback safari because we stayed two nights. Our guide Brandon also was great and did a terrific job getting us up close to the various animal species. The food was underwhelming. Served buffet style and often the same dishes. It's obvious that they push people in and out daily. I recommend bringing your own wine and pay the minimal corkage fee. The pools were pretty, but far too cold to swim and the bartenders didn't know how to make many drinks and frequently didn't have change when paying cash. This is a great place to experience seeing the animals but know that it is a huge \"zoo\" type of experience rather than a real natural safari. They do a great job and it is worth an overnight in one of the nicer accommodations, but one night is enough. It is close to Cape Town and a beautiful it"

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay after having made a booking directly via their website. We were met by very friendly staff and the check-in procedures were without any hassles. We believe that this game reserve serves those who have limited time and are restricted geographically to the Western Cape. We believe that a day trip from Cape Town or an one night overnight at the venue is sufficient to see the \"Big Five\". In general the game does not originate in the Klein Karoo and therefore the habitat does not supply sufficient feed; the game therefore has to be fed which means that they congregate in the same place. The experience and expectation of the search is therefore lost; our guide (Adriaan), however, really went out of his way to make this a safari experience. Included in every overnight stay we were entitled to a morning and afternoon game drive. The three buffet meals included would not be classified as \"fine dining\" but the quality and variety was good. We believe that the cottages could do with a make-over, but found the daily cleaning and service to be good. We liked the relaxed atmosphere and spoke to many overseas visitors who thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Thank you to all the courteous and friendly staff who made our visit a good one."

He stopped close to a group of Zebra's and giraffes and we could get out of the jeep, and enjoy a glass of sparkling wine! Great moments. The park wasn't that big so indeed it indeed did feel a big like a large zoo. It's still very cool, but if you demand top quality you might want to look for an alternative option. The resort was nice and we enjoyed the food a lot! Eployees were friendly and helpful where needed. Other guests were a bit older of age (many 50+) than us.

Whilst my trip to Aquila and the fantastic service was memorable, be under no illusion this is not kruger national and the animals that you see whilst wild are confined to the fenced of areas. So please don't expect the authentic wild experience of an African Safari or you will end up disappointed . A fellow traveller best described it as a big zoo and I kind of got her point. That aside if you have limited time and want to get a taste of Africa then I recommend the tour . We started with a free breakfast which was pretty good !Watered and fed we were driven through the the first set of Yates to the two elephants that they have. 10 mins later we were witnessing 3 very young giraffe , followed by some young zebra, springbok and wildebeest .  Another gate later into the lion enclosure I have never seen lions look this Drowsy almost sedated.The most spectacular moment was the birth of a baby springbok literally inform of me .. Awesome We then arrived at the watering hole, a few rhino, wildebeest and zebras.The buffalo refused to show itself as we drove past its watering hole but I was glad to get out of the scorching sun and looked forward to seeing the cheetahs. Sadly these cats were in an enclosure so it was not what I expected. Some free fizz and then we were off to a free buffet lunch . The ambience food and service of Aquila is great and cannot be faulted, it is very pricy but it is probably expensive to maintain such a vast zoo."

Our driver was driving a bit fast, and had no regard for speed bumps, whci didnt make for the comfiest journey. Anyway, when we arrived we were welcomed with a buffet breakfast which i could not fault. Our game drive started an hour after we arrived. Our guide was Freddie and he was absolutely fantastic. He explained all about the animals, and gave us plenty tof time to photograph animals as we were going along. He got as close as possible and was able to answer all of the many questions he was asked. We were out for over 2 hours, we saw 4 of the big 5, then were taken to the ARC which i did not like as much. Animals are in compounds, but theyre rescued animals so they cant let them out. I would cut this out of the game drive completely, it is a bit of an anti climax at the end. We then came back for a buffet lunch, where you had to pay for your own drinks. They dont even have water at lunch time, if you want water you have to pay for it. They should have juice or water free as part of your lunch, then if you want anything different, fair enough, you pay. Then we had a couple of hours to relax at the pool. We then had over 2 hours drive back to our hotel. 5 star for Freddie and the game drive and breakfast, 2 star for lunch and the ARC. But all in all an enjoyable day."

Years ago (in 2007) it was my very first game reserve I visited, and it was so amazing and beautiful that it started me to travel Africa a lot that past years, from one Game Reserve to the next National Park.But Aquila will always be in my mind for one of the most amazing days I ever enjoyed. The second time in 2009 wasn't less memorable. :-)"

            "review": "Our only chance of a safari this time in South Africa.. We were in Cape Town for New Year and the cricket test match between South Africa and England, due time and logistics, a game reserve close to Cape Town was our only viable option (this should prevent people thinking \"why didn't you do a proper safari in Kruger or Botswana\") so after reading reviews of all said options, we opted for Aquila. We left it up to our hotel to book for us while we went out for the day, Robben Island and Table Mountain. When we arrived back, the hotel reception informed us we could only do the later pick, which at least meant we didn't have to get up at the crack of dawn. We were picked up in a minibus, and made the 2 1/2 hour drive to the game reserve. On arrival we sorted out all the payment at the reception and then had a really good lunch (included in booking) before setting off on our little safari. Now, this is a private game reserve, so it's fully enclosed, but for previous reviewers (from the UK too) to compare it to a safari park is a bit much, have they ever been to the West Midlands Safari Park?? The area is quite vast, apart from the Lions (i'll come to that) i'm sure there is plenty of room for the animals to roam about freely, and they're safe from any poaching within the reserve, with medical staff at hand. The sad part for me, was the Lion enclosure, this wasn't the largest area and they did look a bit lethargic to be honest. Well, put it this way, we were right up close to them and they didn't bother ripping our heads off!!! I found the staff perfectly fine, our guide was very knowledgable, but maybe could've been a bit more engaging with everyone, maybe some sort of speaker system in the trucks would be beneficial.Also, with it being a reserve, you are pretty much guaranteed to see everything.All in all, it was an enjoyable day."

After some research and naively believing misleading advertisements I decided on Aquila. We are a South African family who have visited many private game lodges as well as Kruger Park and Pilanesburg and were so shocked by the time our booked 3 hour (actual 2hrs 15min) had ended. I just cannot recommend this destination from the badly organized reception with hot grape juice and cheap champagne as welcome drinks to the end of the so called safari. Saddest animals in closed off camps being fed by staff. The last straw was when the two elephants were chased to meet our vehicle and we were told we were lucky to spot them. The lions oh the poor lionesses !!!!! King of the animals hot and thirsty ..... Crazy tourist threw a plastic water bottle at them. The vehicles driving around a la convoy ... Too much noise and dust. After a decent buffet the staff lounging around at the tables ........ This was not a good experience."

The jeeps took large quantities of visitors on tour lasting less than 2. It was clear from the start that the tour followed a set path were certain animals were placed and food provided for them in those areas. Although we got to see the Lions up close they were clearly enclosed in what appeared to be a relatively small area for animals of this size ! The pool area was dirty and there was no health and safety standards as people had glasses of drinks in and around the pool .I would not recommend this visit, despite seeing 4 of the big 5"

We drove ourselves from Cape Town, which took just shy of 2 hours. It was the easiest journey ever, through fantastic mountainous countryside. We even saw baboons at the road side! When we arrived we were greeted with a welcome drink, then we had a lovely hot buffet lunch, which was high quality and had plenty of variety. Our room was the cheapest option of room available but it was perfect. The aircon was a god send. Very clean and comfortable! Onto the safari - WOW!! Our tour guide was Johan (sorry not sure on the spelling), he was brilliant. On the first 3 hour safari we saw Hippo, Rhino, Elephants, Giraffes, Springbok, Wildebeast, Ostrich and Lions. The Elephants came right up to the vehicle. Half way through we stopped for a nice snack and a glass of fizz, lovely extra tough. The evening meal was really nice. We spent the evening chilling outside, enjoying the sunset with a cocktail before having a refreshing and comfortable sleep. The morning safari was good too, we saw leopards, cheetahs and crocodiles. We then enjoyed a nice breakfast before heading for home feeling amazed at what we had just experieced. I would recommend waiting until you arrive in SA before booking. We got the trip fro half of what we almost booked it for in England. There was a man stood on the waterfront at the V&A who sorted it all out for us and we paid when we got there. The whole trip was less than \u00a3200 for two. Very satisfied customers :)"

Also an outside shower which was so cool!! The ac didn't cool the upper floor as it was badly positioned so we had to bring the mattress downstairs. I think if was slightly misleading as we only saw lions, rhinos and elephants. We did see cheetahs but they were in rehabilitation cages. We also saw zebras and giraffes. The service was pretty poor but overall it was a great experience. Tip there are great fridges in rooms so you can byo - no TVs which I thought was great and only local plug sockets so you need a convertor. The safari on the first day was the best the 2nd day nowhere near as good. There was no BBQ in the evening as promised in the brochure. But give it a go it was the best day of our hols!"

Was told to be there for 12.00 noon with the safari starting at 1.30 and lasting till 4.30. Obviously the 3 hour safari was why we were there. In the event the safari only lasted 2 hours, and part of that included 30 mins in what they call their Animal Rescue & Conservation Centre, which is a few animals in cages.All in all a complete waste of time. During the 1.5 hour safari we did not see any lions, they were asleep avoiding the hot sun, we could not find the giraffes, all we saw was a couple of elephants, a couple of rhinos lounging in a watering hold, a few gizzelle and zebra. Quite frankly you will see more in an hour in the London Zoo.And it is over a 2 hour drive from Cape Town. We had little traffic and the driver was going quite fast. So over 2 hours on the road each way to see very little.And you are not really on safari in the wild. The whole place is a fenced enclosure where they drive you round on man made dirt tracks, with several man made watering holes and the animals are fed. And beware. When you drive inland it becomes extremely hot. No sea breezes."

Bathroom was quirky and made of stone and again HUGE.Staff were absolutely fantastic and nothing was ever too much. The food served in the restaurant was buffet style... it was ok... it wasn't amazing but then, to be honest, I wasn't expecting it to be.We stayed during Easter and one of the owners made such a lovely fuss of our son and gave him a lovely Easter present which was just SO kind! They laid on a gorgeous easter egg hunt and got all the children little presents! They really went above and beyond with this and I really want to say thank you!Now the safari. This was our very first safari and being in South Africa I was expecting a lot... perhaps this is my fault as I knew full well it wasn't the Kruger. It was absolutely fine and we saw the big 5 and extra BUT it felt like I was in a bog standard safari park. The lions were in a separate enclosure so they didn't eat all the other animals as obviously its a young game reserve which we totally understood why but it kind of detracted from the \"genuine safari\" experience. The guides were extremely knowledgable and gave a great tour as well as lots of information. I suppose because it was a smaller game reserve it was very appropriate for a 2.5 year old chid to be on it.I also chose to do a horse back safari which was included in the price and this really was special. I would highly recommend doing this.We stayed for 3 nights and I think this was the perfect amount of time... any longer and we probably would have started to get bored as we'd seen all the animals.All in all, an amazing hotel, amazing staff, good food and wine and an all round alright safari. If you are travelling with children and you want a safe family safari then this is perfect for you. If you are a grown up couple/solo traveller and you want to experience a safari then I'd suggest heading to the Kruger to do the real thing."

After a very nice buffet breakfast we went on to our safari. The guide was very nice and informative, and it was good to see that he was not in a hurry. We saw the Big 5 and the main 'attraction' was the lion's cage. The cage is easily 2km x 2km! And we got to see them at a distance of 5m.

These zebras did not move, except for eating. Our bus was right next to them. Zebras are not friendly animals and they certainly would never have stayed right next to a vehicle with people in it taking their pictures and talking loudly.

My girlfriend and I decided to visit Aquila on the last day of our two week trip to Cape Town and the surrounding area. It was supposed to be a nice finale to an incredible trip but unfortunately we were left feeling incredibly underwhelmed!The main plus point of this trip was a fun drive around the reserve led by enthusiastic and knowledgable guide Mike. We saw various different animals, got close enough for some great photos and saw the incredible scenery that accompanies that part of the world. The drive to Aquila is also jaw-dropping!However, a few words of advice:1. Don't less them mess you around! After booking a horseback and game drive combo safari (with Aquila taking payment Details for this) we got an email telling us that actually they were full and we could only do the ride. A phone call followed and after some pressure Aquila found a solution to deliver us what we'd booked! I'd expect them to do this as a matter of course, not only once pressure is applied!2. DO NOT BOOK THE HORSEBACK SAFARI! Despite the sales pitch that it would be 1.5 to 2 hours we actually spent less than 1 hour in the reserve on the horses in which time an encounter with some Zebras was as good as it got. 15-20 minutes of the ride was wasted by the guide taking photos of everyone individually with their cameras - a nice thought but it cut our short experience even shorter! My horse was an aggressive sort who kept biting the horses in front despite my best efforts to restrain him.This eventually resulted in one of the horses kicking out repeatedly with its hind legs, frightening the life out of its rider and only missing my head by inches. No instruction was provided to novice riders and the helmets were cycle helmets rather than proper riding helmets. Compared to a horseback wine tour we did in Franschoek earlier in the week (for a third of the price) this was amateurish!3. Lunch may be included in your package but drinks are not! After returning from our short horse ride we had plenty of time to kill until lunch finally came about. It was boiling hot so we were desperate for a drink with our lunch. However we were promptly told that no drinks were included in our lunch. After a request for a simple jug of tap water the waitress came back saying no, we had to buy drinks. When I asked to speak to the manager she returned to tell me the manager had said we have to buy drinks and he was not interested in speaking to me! If I did that in my job I wouldn't be a manager for much longer!4. Don't expect a proper Game Reserve! This is an animal park at best. Most animals roam fairly freely but the poor lions sit in a very small enclosure and look miserable (and hugely overfed). There is no leopard in the game reserve but in order to be a able to claim they have the \"Big 5\" they keep one locked in a \"rescue centre\" which they take you to at the end for some photos.Final verdict: if you want to go on safari then try to do it in one of the proper game reserves. If you don't want to stray too far from Cape Town then do something different as there's so many fantastic options. If you want to see animals in enclosures then go to a Zoo. And if you feel that despite all this you simply have to go to Aquila then go with very low expectations or be prepared to be underwhelmed! If you want to do a tour on horseback then I strongly recommend the Wine Tour from Paradise Stables in Franschoek which was a hugely fun afternoon for us and it much cheaper and closer to Cape Town!This place is hugely overpriced for what it delivers and once they've taken your money you are more of an inconvenience to them than a customer they wish to delight!"

Saw a mother hippo with her baby. Our guide was very knowledgeable and could answer any questions. Rooms were a bit dark. But the showers were stone built outside attached to the room and worked well - had the birds taking a shower with you. Food was just ok but a bit canteen like. The views from the terrace were magnificent. Bumpy ride because of the terrain but well worth it. We forgot to empty the safe but the park were very good and had our belongings sent on to the office in Cape Town to save us driving back."

The guide, Daniel, was knowledgeable about the animals and their behaviour (he gets the place its 4th star.) The journey around the reserve was just long enough and Daniel was honest about how many animals the reserve had and that it was quite new and still growing. The only sour note came when we were told that the lions had several hundred hectares in which to roam but it was painfully obvious that they were surrounded by 7' high electric fences, with no means of exit or entrance, in an area of precisely one hectare.So a good day spoiled by one piece of disinformation."

Eating breakfast against the mountains was really lovely. Driving around the park was also just stunning as the scenery is some of the best I have ever seen. The \"safari\" wasn't so much a safari as it was a drive round to see the animals. Similar to that of a safari park in the UK just much larger and in a better location. Yes you see all the big 5 but it's very obviously constructed. I was prepared since reading the reviews so wasn't expecting a true safari experience, so in all I was pretty happy and we had a really great day. Would recommend if you are very tight for time while in Cape Town which I was. Also I wouldn't recommend going for more than one game drive as you see everything in the first drive."

Aquila it is off course diferent from major game areas where you can see animals in their true and wild habitat, As a private reserve it does the job of presenting (amost) all of the published animals, in good conditions and with very good guides. In other game areas like Masai Mara for example we only managed to spot all the animals we saw in 2 hours in three days.The area is not huge but for the amount of animals they have it seems suitable, while trying to maintain the feel of the wild and acting as conservation agents. You can see the animals real close, specially the lions.Good option if you are staying in cape town area."

            "review": "A great time-conscious option near Cape Town. Since we have not had the experience of the longer, more in-depth safaris available in other parts of the country we have nothing to compare. That said, if you are in Cape Town and do not have time in your planning to drive almost 20 hours to Johannesburg or fly 3 hours and drive more, Aquila offers a wonderful option to give tourists a taste of the more extensive experience. We were picked up timely in Cape Town and enjoyed the 2+ hour drive through wine country to the reserve. We were greeted with wine upon arrival at what first appeared to be a non-descript lodge. We soon realized that the lodge was not oriented to the parking lot but to the reserve. It opened out as we entered through the reception building to beautiful views of the reserve and low traditional buildings along with a lovely lodge and very pretty pool area with fire pits and a very large bar and entertainment building. All are constructed from hand-hewn logs, white stucco and thatch. Very appealing. We had booked 2 of the private villas - one for our son and daughter and one for us. We were all quite taken by the villas. Each was unique, built from rocks and natural woods right into the side of the hill. They each had balconies, great beds, fireplaces, a small kitchenette and were light filled and air conditioned. The kids' lodge had a private out door shower that my son loved. Ours also had a jacuzzi surrounded by rocks and sky. Just great. We gathered back at the reception area for our afternoon game drive. Our guide was Daniel -Great guy! He has been at the resort for 8 years. Very knowledgeable and funny. Went to great lengths to make sure we saw absolutely everything possible. Our drive lasted somewhere between 2.5 and 3 hours. We took a break in the middle to have a lovely picnic of champagne in flutes and snacks served by Daniel overlooking the valley. Quite the memory. Gave us time to mingle with the other folks on the trek. Nice touch, I thought, and great photo ops too. Got back to the lodge for supper which was really nice. I quite disagree with a previous reviewer who referred to the food as a poor buffet in an area with a canteen feel. The lodge has at least two-story ceilings, heavy log beams, huge chandeliers and walls of windows overlooking the reserve and the sunset. The service was polite and prompts. The food was ample and tasty. The salad bar was approx 12ft long and included a large variety of fresh starters. The main dishes included BBQ chicken, roast, fried prawns, peel and eat prawns along with a variety of sides. There were soups and at least 4 desserts. There was a bottle of wine in each lodge and wine at dinner. Absolutely something for everyone. We enjoyed our lodges that night and my son enjoyed time spent watching rugby in the bar area. For the morning game drive, which convenes quite early at 6:30, they have ready hot coffee, tea and rusk. The morning drive is shorter and there is a visit to the rescue center the reserve runs. There are not huge numbers of animals in the reserve but the number is appropriate for the size of the reserve and the time allotted for the game drives. The work the rescue center does in promoting the welfare of these animals is also compelling. We came back to the lodge for another ample buffet, this time for brunch. Again, a large variety of options hot and well prepared including a smiling lady fixing your eggs however you like. After your bellies are full, you are driven back to your hotel in Cape Town through the lovely vineyards and gorgeous mountain vistas. While the meals were not 4 star quality and there are not thousands of animals, the offerings at Aquilla are, nevertheless, quite a bargain. For all I just described at the present exchange rate in USD for a family of 4 adults we paid right at $950. You would be hard pressed to gather that much entertainment, information, food, lodging, transportation and memory material for that amount of money.I can't imagine what else we could have done for the overnight we spent at Aquilla to give us a better Arican memory in the time we had to spend."

We did the one night stay option which came with 2 \"game drives\" which we booked with a GroupOn voucher (50% off). Overall for what we paid it was good, but at full price it would be poor value. Accommodation was nice, and the buffet for lunch, dinner and breakfast okay. Drinks are extra , but the prices are very reasonable. The whole \"Big 5\" thing is a bit like a glorified zoo though, and nothing like a proper safari experience you get in Kruger or the like of. Yes you do get close up to the animals and you do get to \"tick\" that box (seen the Big 5) and come away with great photos, but it does feel a little staged. When we went into the \"park\" area, we never had to drive far to see the animals - they all hang around the feeding areas. Yes, even though they claim to have \"reintroduced\" these animals to their natural environment , they still need to supplement their diet so that the animals can survive ....Like I said, at the price we paid I felt it was okay. One thing that this did make me realise was that next time I come to SA I definitely want to do a real safari.If you are short on time , or cant get to Kruger or one of the other safari areas then this is a \"box ticker\""

            "review": "A good option from Cape Town. I think any review for this place needs to be considered in context. It is clearly not located in Kruger National Park and is only two hours from Cape Town. It therefore attracts many tourists both for day visits and overnight stays.If you want to see the big 5 (unlikely to see a Leopard) in their semi-natural environment (this is a fenced in relatively small game reserve) and are tight on time and budget then this is a good option. It is a well-run commercial venture in a pleasant setting outside of Cape Town. We stayed overnight in a lodge which has nice views over the park and good facilities considering the remote location. The bath and outside shower overlooking the reserve are unique features.The game drives are well run with reasonably knowledgeable guides. I was however slightly disappointed to learn that the reserve only has two elephants, seven lions (kept in a separate sectioned off part of the reserve) and two giraffes. The park does have rhinos but understandably the guides are not permitted to divulge the number. There are many other animals including zebra, hippos, buffalo and springboks.I would advise not staying the night and just coming for the day because the food is very average (a poor buffet) in a dining area with a canteen feel. In addition, the morning game drive is short and half the time is spent viewing rescued animals in a zoo (with more space) like area.If you are staying in the Western Cape area I would recommend a visit. However, I would not travel from far solely to visit the reserve."

            "review": "Party animals. If you are looking for an authentic experience of the African bush and its game, with some peace and quiet and where you are made to feel like a valued customer, I would suggest you avoid Aquila. Our 1 night experience was completely destroyed by a large corporate group who were allowed to have their massive party at the expense of all the private guests. The music was so loud that we could not sleep and there were drunk people shouting and screaming in the early hours of the morning. My complaint to the front desk in the evening was ignored by the manager who clearly was unwilling or unable to control the situation. But the most shocking part was his attitude when we checked out. He offered no apology, despite the fact that there were a number of us complaining very vocally and strongly about it (including Dutch and American visitors) and told us casually that...the music normally stops at 11pm!What became clear to me is that Aquila is driven by maximising profit in a highly commercialised operation where the guest is no more than a number. The personal touch is completely lacking and staff are trained to efficiently clear away plates and smile, but could not offer me a cold beer and there was no beer on tap. A steady flow of international tourists are lured into paying relatively high prices for the chance of seeing the \"Big 5\". \"Big 5\" is not exactly true now, is it? Perhaps \"Big 3\" is more realistic. You definitely won't see a Leopard in the wild in that area on a game drive (unless it's in a cage, like the poor specimen that they have rescued which has no claws and will never hunt again) and we didn't see the few Buffalo that they have somewhere in the relatively small reserve, either on our evening or morning game drives (about 5 hours in total). It amazed me that with so many vehicles constantly driving around a limited area and being in touch via radio, they couldn't 'find' the buffalo...So yes, you may see a couple of Rhino and a couple of elephant and you would have to be blind not to see the grossly obese lions in the relatively small, fenced off enclosure who are fed and don't hunt naturally. I believe that the elephants are also fed as they would not be able to get enough to eat by foraging for themselves in that area.Overall, the accommodation was pretty basic for what one is paying (we were in a chalet near the entrance to the reserve); only 1 side of the 2 single beds had a bedside table and lamp and our toilet seemed to leak when we drained the bath. To top things off, we also had the smell of sewerage in the vicinity of our accommodation. And there are loads of mosquitos, so be prepared.I would recommend visiting one of the many good South African National Parks, including the Kruger National Park. At least they don\u2019t allow music and their parks are very efficiently run and a lot better value for money. I would rather be somewhere more authentic where at least I have the chance of seeing a wild, free-roaming lion and sitting quietly under the stars at night listening to them roar."

There are no leopards in Aquila, only in there \"rescue camp\". This camp is similar to a zoo: animals are kept in separate cages... All animals are fed in Aquila, also that are in the \"wildpark\"!!Overall Aquila was in terms of spotting animals a very disappointing experience and I would recommend most people to skip this park!

Room wasn't ready when we arrived so we had our lunch first before going to drop off bags for the sunset game drive. Arrived at room where we had 2 single beds, specifically asked for a double bed so had to call for them to change it. The staff member who assisted us with our bags to the room didn't show us how to make the fire (would have been nice as it was winter and freezing). The game drive was an absolute disappointment.. This is NOT a game reserve, it is more like an animal sanctuary/big zoo without the cages; they supplement all the animals food (I understand the land does not permit for them to feed off naturally but this should then be clearly mentioned on the website so tourists know before hand)! The lions are kept in a gated area and are always near the entry/exit gates as they are familiar with humans as they are feed by Aquila every week and don't hunt. Saw the elephants for 5 minutes before they retreated to their huts for feeding where they remained (didn't see them in the morning drive the next day either as they were still feeding).Big 5... As it is advertised is a joke.. The leopard hasn't been seen by one of the rangers who has worked there for years!! We all heard of the load shedding in South Africa so it was expected when the lights went out and the lodge wasn't to blame however no one offered us a torch to get back to our room so we had to walk in the dark; candles were provided in the room but no candle holders??!!The food was average; some nice dishes and some not so nice but this is just to personal taste I guess. Would not recommend Aquila to anyone (our UK and Dubai friends were quite pleased we tried it before they booked) and didn't waste their time or money. "

This was a spectacular experience because we got really close to many species and also rode through some terrific topography. You will go around lakes and see elephants playing, track giraffes and ride up right next to rhinos and many other species on the preserve. The guide allows time for picture taking. Dress appropriately for the weather with peel away layers and sun and mosquito protection. The lodge is very rustic with a modern flair.

The comments about it being zoo like are exaggerated for sure. The park is great and our guide, Kensington, was terrific! It's too bad that's not all this experience includes. I'd have been happy just driving in to see that then leaving. The breakfast and the lunch were not very good, and the little pool break you have after is just a waste of time. Our entire group was just itching to go since the little rest area feels incredibly touristy. I'd have much rather spent that time in Cape Town instead.That said though, if you're looking for a good day trip safari to see some cool animals while you're in Cape Town for a shorter visit, this could be the perfect way for you to do that. Just don't expect much from the food and bring a good book while you lounge around after. The safari part of the day was well worth it!"

Huge open spaces & the safari tour in open air bus was great, the tour guide was friendly & did a good job.Animals were in good condition.When the sun goes down it gets chilly take a jacket or a sweater as the safari tour is 3 hours plus.Dinner & breakfast was delicious large Buffett in African restaurant area which has a Pool which looks over the reserve.they keep adding on more rooms Great experience & closeto Cape Town / one nighter is a must. Cheers!"

Welcome drink on arrival and lunch available before check in at 2pm. Saw a Elephant walk past our accommodation before we went on our first tour. First tour was at 4pm and we were lead by our guide Roland. Roland knew his job and had a real passion for it. We were lucky that we managed to get one of the smaller trucks and there were only 6 of us which added to the experience. Staying overnight was a very cool experience with the added bonus over the 'outside' shower in the morning. Second tour is at 7am with a different route around the Reserve. We got to see all of the big 5 plus a host of other animals. Bit worrying when the Lion started walking to the truck but really added to the excitement!! If you are in Cape Town I would recommend you check this place out."

There are a number of types of safari on offer, and we selected the simple day trip safari. On arrival we had a welcome drink followed by breakfast from a well-stocked buffet to suit all tastes. We then went in a landrover around the reserve for about a three hour safari. The game park is probably more touristy than a true safari in that the animals are fairly immune to the presence of people - which of course has the advantage of allowing you to get up quite close to some of them \u2013 and you certainly won\u2019t see any kills in the wild. But we did see lots of different types of animals, including elephants, buffalo, rhinos, hippos, giraffes, zebras, crocodiles, ostrich and different types of deer, although not in great numbers, while the cheetahs, lions and leopard were in confined areas rather than in the wild. The driver/guide was friendly and informative and there were several stops for photo opportunities. On return to the lodge, we were served lunch, again a well stocked and varied buffet. We then spent an hour or so relaxing by the pool with a glass or two of South African wine before returning home."

The selection was quite large and consisted of everything from starters to desserts and cheeses.The waiting staff are attentive and polite.We also went on an early evening game drive (it was also available for the following morning, which we skipped). The driver / guide, Randall, was well informed about the animals that he showed us and welcomed questions from guests.

Although we thought we'd be out there for a couple of hours it was nearly 3 and every minute was great.

            "review": "Halfway between a zoo and a safari (yet somewhat closer to the zoo). As other contributors indicated: it's somewhat halfway between a zoo and a safari. The herbivores (elephants, buffalos, rhinos,...) are sharing a few thousands hectares of land, yet it's clear most of them have their preferred spot (where they most probably receive some extra feeding) hence are not too difficult to find... Lions and other carnivores are kept separately. Yet we enjoyed the tour: the guide was very knowledgeable and friendly with lots of humor. Make sure, though, to be sitting near the front of the vehicle, since at the back of the larger vehicles it's almost impossible to hear what the guide is saying.You can order transfer from/to your hotel in Cape Town for a one day tour; pick-up time is quite early (ca. 5.45-6.45AM). Upon arrival (after ca. 2 hours drive) they serve you breakfast before you leave for the tour. The tour takes ca. 3 hours; afterwards you receive a buffet lunch. Food is OK. However, buses back only left at 3.00-3.30PM, which left us with too much wasted time (there is an outdoor swimming pool, yet is was raining...). Most people were ready to return by 2PM, yet even though they had two buses returning to Cape Town, none of both left before 3PM.Anyhow, when spending some time in Cape Town and you are compiling a diversified programme (particularly with children), Aquila game reserve is certainly a nice attraction to put on your list."

As it was month of August, it was quite cold. We then got into a pick-up which was modified with seats. The driver who was also our guide seem to be knowledgeable about the private reserve but then he does those tours multiple times a day. He did not have any kind of safety precautions like a gun, etc..We did have a chance to see Rhino, Giraffe, Elephants, Zebra, Lion, etc.. The lions are kept in a separate area. We spotted lioness and lion behind a net, more like a big cage which was a disappointment. On the flip side, they take care of animals which are sick or rescued on the other side of the reserve. You pay approx 350-400$US for the drive and back. Also 100$ for the safari per person when they are running a special offer. I think it is commercialised too. It can be fun for kids. I would recommend people to do a proper safari but if you are short of time and with kids then you can do this Aquila safari. I wont do this again. I wouldn't rate it as outstanding experience."

I took a day trip from the Westin Cape Town and was amazed by what a gorgeous drive our driver took us on via the N1, right through wine country, the Huguenot Tunnel and the breathtaking Du Toit's Kloof Pass, with waterfalls and granite mountians. Once there, champagne and food was lovely. Please request our guide Kensington. He made the whole safari wonderful and warm and was so knowledgeable. He is a wonderful guide with such enthusiasm and care for the animals at Aquila. It looked like a fun place to stay, but was very pleased with the single safari. We saw elephants, rhinos, zebras, springbok, hippos, eland, giraffes, and lions. The rehabilitation center was nice though we were concerned about a different tour group of teenagers who were hollering at the animals and one who tried to throw a rock at a caged lion. (One of our tour group told them to stop and reported them.) The staff and facilities were wonderful and compassionate with the animals and the whole property seemed very socially conscious. Even were it not for the amazing animals, the drive around the property was just breathtakingly beautiful. Lunch was good and we were back to Cape town by 17:00, equally enjoying the drive back. (Our driver was with M.K. Exotic.) I highly recommend Aquila to anyone visiting Cape Town to enjoy the natural beauty and amazing animals!"

Our game drive guide was highly knowledgeable about the animals and the wildlife. We were able to see most of the animals and it was truly a very good experience not only for me and my wife but also the little one. After the game drive we were left to feast in on lunch which was again a good one. there is also option of horse riding after lunch though we weren't part of it I reckon people who had gone for it enjoyed it thoroughly. If you are in Cape town I would highly recommend Aquila."

My parter is an excellent rider but meant that he spent most of his time trying to control a horse that should not be used for riding with the general public. The riding tack and saddles were old and not well cared for. Food at the lodge was as good as could be expected from mass catering. Breakfast was cold and unappetizing. The lodge was also freezing cold. This place caters for up to 700 people per day in Summer, it was dreadful in winter with approx 150 guests.It was terribly expensive and appeared to be about profit taking not animal welfare!"

Seeing hippos, lions and rhinos up close was an unforgettable experience. All animals look well and healthy. You are not guaranteed to see animals, like on any safari - we were so lucky we came face to face with the lions, as other groups did not see them at all. The guides are fab - we had hot water bottles and blankets in the morning trip, sherry and snacks at a stop off point in the eve which was so lovely. The cabins are lovely too! We stayed here for one night which included the 2 safaris, dinner and breaky - was superb value! Ignore the negative people on here, it is what it is, but I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Don't forget...all safaris are in enclosures of some sort, this one is just the same, but a bit smaller.

Our favorite activity that we did there was horseback riding, where we had the best guide! I think his name was Shedrick. My only disappointment is that the carnivores are kept in a separate area. The lions have their own fenced in area away from the other animals, which you could still drive through, and the leopard was on the other side of the road in its own exhibit. And we totally get it- they can't risk the lions eating the other animals as I'm sure they're quite expensive. It wasn't as natural as we had thought. We were expecting a mini version of Kruger Park. Although they had all of the Big 5 animals, we feel that we can't exactly count it as such as it felt more like a drive through zoo. That being said, it was a great getaway and a really easy drive from Cape Town."

Overall a wonderful experience, great game drives, friendly staff and very informative people too.The rooms were nicely done, like you would find at any decent hotel etc, fully stocked with all the needs you could want.However, I would recommend a few touches just to take it to another level. 1. Have small foot carpets on either side of the bed, the concrete gets very cold, even in summer, no one likes to come out of a hot bath or shower and get dressed on a cold floor next to the bed.2. Even though using an old style wood fired stove is a novel idea for a fireplace in the rooms, it is not practical and would recommend a proper fireplace in the room. 3. The food was great and the roasts were absolutely lovely, however I would possibly look at having a secondary side dish with the roasts, as both lunch and dinner had roasts (it gets a bit much after a few days), so in essence if lots of guests like the roasts then keep them but also look at having another dish, like a pasta dish or a stew/curry etc so there is a little more \"mains\" variety.4. The use of WiFi repeaters would be a much better option than having multiple WiFi hotspots as the signal was also very poor in certain areas, this I believe is quite an important point here as there is very little Cellular (Mobile) phone coverage as you are quite deep in the wilderness."

On our arrival, our room which we paid +-R12k/night for was not ready. This following a call from my wife confirming that we could check-in at 12pm - our room was ready at 3:453. Our 4yr old daughter requested to bath, their was no bath plug4. When we switched the bed side lamps on, the fan was wired with the bed lamps so in the freezing cold of winter we had to either read in the dark or accept that a fan would blow the freezing air. When inspected closer, there were 3 different appliances wired to the same 15amp plug (fan, heater, and 2 bedside lamps), I believe this is illegal and an insurance claim on your thatch roofed building would be declined4. The first night it rained in through the roof and flooded the room5. The hot shower tap only worked if you opened and closed it several times. A little banging on the wall also helped to get the water flow going. Took us about 10min to work out. Would be useful if instructions were provided6. The peacock jumped onto my 4yr olds head (I have no problem with that, it is a wild animal and we understand that) but when I requested a plaster and dettol to clean her wound your first aid kit was not stocked and the staff could not find a plaster or Dettol7. In general the room was tired, blinds looked like something my great grand mother would have made herself, it was missing hooks & rods & hanging skew and did not function properly8. The rooms were not 100% clean and the shower glass in all rooms was horribly stained9. The chimney cowl was seized in a direction opposite to the wind direction, as a result our room was filled with smoke10. The game drives were fantastic, Daniel was great and took the time to explain everything to all the guests. We truly enjoyed hearing his knowledge of the area and that of the animals. 10 out of 10 to Daniel For 12k/night excl drinks, etc I would rather spend my money in Mauritius. PLEASE IMPROVE THE IMAGE OF CT AS A DESTINATION, WE NEED REPETITIVE TOURISM. IM ASHAMED."

The chalet in my opinion was not 4 star standard as advertised, ie the heating pad fell off the wall as i brushed against it ! Candles are supplied in case of power cuts ( which occourred ) but no matches to light them ! The resturant was good, and the staff running it were top notch and very friendly, but the buffet meals were lukewarm. The game drives were good. Perhaps i should mention it was a july visit ( winter in the cape ) and there was snow on the mountaines, and frost on the ground. Aquila would"

You would get information from one person and when you arrive for your activity the next person will inform you of something different. The accommodation was not up to standard we were their during winter and the fireplace in the one room was out of order (we were not informed we had to ask arround). No towels in the room. No phone to call reception one has to use your cellphone to call reception or the manager on duty. Rooms are very standard I expected the rooms to be luxury like they advised it ( and for the rate per person).We immidately decided that we are not staying for two night and we checked out the next morning.

There was an open storm water / sewage cover immediately in front of the accomodation we stayed in - not ideal when you have young children. When booking no mention was made of the construction of additional units adjoining the restaurant which meant we were greeted with the sound of drilling, grinding, hammering and yelling from 8:00am to 7:00pm every day we were there. Drain clearing equipment was left lying around in the area imeediately in front of our chalet. Again - not ideal when you have young children with you. Finally the fence that is meant to enclose the childs play area is in serious disrepair - I could fit through that gap so certainly less than child friendly."

It was actually really lovely to see the animals in a more 'natural' environment; it felt very real. The disappointment was the lions, behind fencing and miserable - you would get nearer to them in a UK safari park. Lunch was good and the ride home fine.

But we saw a lot and that is what people want and the horsebacksafari was an amazing experience.

I was dissapointed with the cleanliness of my cottage (cottage 8, dead insects on the bed and on the floor, a VERY dirty toilet and fireplace that still had the previous guests burnt wood in it). Service at reception was non existent, staff didnt have sense of urgency at all and i was ignored for a few minutes when we arrived (i had to call a receptionist because they were standing chatting in the back office area) and every time i asked for something i was told to get it myself. (told to go to the restaurant to get a multi plug, i was asked to pay R100 for the multi plug, when i said add it to my room i was told that wasnt possible and only cash would be accepted (makes me think the staff are wanting to pocket the R100), told to go to the bar to get more blitz for my fireplace and so on). Shadrack took us to our room, he pointed out himself that there was no complimentary water in the room. This was never replaced nor were there any amenties in the bathroom. There was only 1 bathrobe in the room and the fridge wasnt even on. Just a few niggles that really got to me during the stay. I am not one to complain as i work in the industry and know how it can be but after receiving this feedback email i felt that i should say something. As the duty manager at of a 5 star wine estate I will find it difficult recommending Aquila to our guests who enquire about safari's. I will gladly point out more issues should you want that, after all we are here to blow the guest away and if my constructive feedback will be received in a good light i am more than willing to help assist. Your animals make the experience, pity your staff are not able to do the same."

Our unit was nice, but unfortunately positioned right under the towering eucalyptus trees, affording us absolutely no sunlight at all. As I am solar powered, I found this to be rather depressing, and resulted in us having to leave the heaters on full during the day. The unit itself was nice, and we loved the outdoor shower (even in the cold!). What I did find a little bit odd though was that there was no electrical outlet on the counter, meaning that when you wanted to boil the jug for a cuppa you had to put the jug on the floor and unplug either the heater or the fridge. The lighting in the unit was really good, so even though it was dark, there was still sufficient lighting that you could read. The bed and pillows were all super-comfie. We partook of the four game drives through the spectacular scenery. We had two different guides and while they were fine, I actually would have liked to have heard more about each animal and their habits. Both guides seemed to assume that the tourists they had with them had prior experience with the animals, and in many cases this wasn't the case. It would have also have been great to have heard a little bit about the geology of this spectacular area, and also about the fynbos etc etc. All our meals were included in our price and they were good. It was buffet style, with a nice selection. Breakfast was by far and away the best with a variety of hot and cold items. The only thing I can add is that it would have been nice if the dishes at lunch and dinner were labelled as a lot of the time I had no idea what I was putting on my plate."

The Big 5 opportunity just two hours from Cape Town makes it all the better.The drive from Cape Town is not a boring one at all, amazing mountains, Farmlands and well conditioned roads.3 of us only spent one night at at Aquila. We arrived at 12:00pm and had a fantastic welcoming from the staff. we received a welcome drink of either sparkling wine or hot chocolate upon arrival. The sparkling wine was not to my taste but the two aldies loved the hot chocolate on a rainy cold day.We went through for lunch. All meals we had there were buffet style, Breakfast,Lunch and Supper. Normally with buffet, you never know what you might get, but Aquila did a wonderful job with a wide variety of options even for vegetarians. The food over all was very good as well as the restaurants service.They offer two game drives a day, morning and afternoon drives. We were met by our guide Marko, who was very well prepared with blankets to keep us warm. Marko overall was a very knowledgeable guide, he was very well informed on both the fauna and flora. Also very funny and looked after all his guests with both safety of the guests and respect for the animals.The Fauna side of things is what they state. They definitely have the big 5 but don't go there expecting to see huge herds of elephants etc. The park has the right amount of game that it needs too at the moment. You still get fantastic opportunity to view the big 5 in a safe environment. Plus a variety of different antelopes, hippos, giraffes etc. you get the opportunity to view the rehabilitating center which is very interesting and amazing to see what they are currently doing.The accommodation was very comfortable and warm (being winter).We stayed in the family luxury accommodation, had one big double bed and two single beds up stairs. Real African interior design which suits the surroundings. Beautiful stone work design bathroom to add. Only one small problem we did experience problems with the WIFI. We could not connect throughout our stay there. We were told that it was working but none of us could connect. In an environment with stunning views this was not much of a concern with us.For us, one night was great as we got to go on the two drives both evening and morning and saw the big5. There is however lots of other onsite activities to do there like quad biking horse riding etc. I am sure in summer it wouldn't be to hard to sit in one of the beautiful pools with a cold beer. For that reason I am sure we will be back in summer for a couple of nights!"

The food was nice, like good sunday lunch type of food. The staff was in average, professional.The manager was very present and polite. The standard accommodations are nothing like in the pictures and are rather disappointing, really NOT 4 stars! more like 2 stars... If I had paid the full price, I would have been quite disappointed, half price it was okay.. Aquila could improve on some details: like dirty windows in dining room(or rather you could see where the cleaner couldn't reach) and hose in middle of passages (quite hazardous) which for me doesn't really go with a 4 star facility... Anyways.. I would still recommend Aquila with the groupon offer... full price for a standard room is definitely too pricy and disappointing!"

We left Cape Town early and took the very nice scenic drive to Aquila, we were 4 people, all very (super) excited and ready for our overnight stay. Upon arrival we were greeted by staff, friendly and big smiles. We had our arrival and program presentation explained by front desk staff - excellent staff. Received a orientation walk through the Lodge and met Pieter the Peacock who is famous at Aquila. Lunch was absolutely out of the books with a spread to pick and choose from and excellently prepared and presented. Lunch staff, friendly and helpful. We were checked into our Premier Room and wow, what a nice style full, elegant, rustic African feeling. Super clean, comfortable and everything one needs. Game drive was great, information great, driver/ranger extremely knowledgeable, funny and made sure everyone has a good time. Dinner - once again, it's 5 star service!!! Like to thank all at Aquila for a wonderfull experience and a stay over is a definite MUST. If there is anything that will stuck by us, it will be the staff and the 5 star service that was given at a 4 star establishment. Well done!!"

We arrived at 12h30 and after welcome drinks we sat down to enjoy the Buffet lunch. The food was nice and plentiful and they kept checking and replenishing. I prefer desserts to food and even there I had choices. After lunch we went on a game drive which my family thoroughly enjoyed. My son who usually prefers to selfdrive remarked this was nice and relaxing to have someone else drive you whilst you look our for animals. There were water puddles everywhere, evidence of the recent rains and vegetation looked lush (remember they are in the Karoo). I was enthralled because this time around I got to see the Hippos (last time I was on the other side of the vehicle). We saw Giraffes, Eland, black and blue Wildebeest, Springbokkies, Zebra, Rhinos, Ostrich and Elephant. The Lions are in their own enclosure because they would wipe out the population, however I feel to keep them in their \"natural hunt instinct mode\" a Springbokkie (shame) should be let loose in their enclosure periodically. Aquila has a number of different vehicles - although one looks like a truck it still has the openness to enjoy your viewing. You can also go horseback or quadbike riding. Our guide Anwar was very knowledgeable and we thank him. My son said when we go again we must ask for him. My grandson who is two calls everything on four legs a dog, even he was surprised by the many different \"dogs\". At the end of the drive when you said Hippo or Giraffe - he responded Hippodog, Raffdog"

            "review": "Great first safari experience. Only a two hour drive from Cape Town lies the private game reserve of Aquila. Make sure you watch out for the big sign by the road otherwise you might miss the turn! The reserve is amazing! It is huge and a great place for the wild animals to roam. There is also a small sanctuary for hurt and old animals nearby, which can be visited. You can find a couple of lions, cheetah and leopard there. But if you're lucky you can see more lions in the reserve on your safari drive, which I highly recommend! I can promise you will will easily see the Big 5 and halfway through you can even have a glass of champagne to freshen up.And even if being all excited did not consume your energy, you will want to stuff yourself with the lunch buffet! And did I mention the breakfast buffet\u200b? I think it was one of the best ones I've had! Great food, enough variety and plenty of it, too! If a morning safari drive is not enough, you can also do a horseback or quad bike tour through the game reserve for another great experience.One last thing, I didn't sleep at the reserve but the rooms looked just splendid. No matter if you go all luxury with your own little hut overlooking the reserve and a classy stone bathroom or in one of the big family houses, it is all uber stylish and looks very comfortable."

The times had changed for the safaris due to the winter months and this was not taken into account when we booked. Our room was upgraded but it was not taken into account the we required single beds, then they needed to change us again. The room we ended up with was nice but internet was not very good, and we had no power in the morning and still not repaired when we got back from the morning safari. The Safaris are more like going to a zoo they do supplement feeding so the animals would all come up for feeding. The lions are in a separate enclosure. This would be good for kids as they are able to see the animals up close without really having to find them. Information was not given out about the animals. The food was ok but at times not sure what you were eating. Overall we were glad to be leaving missing the lunch to have an early departure"

When we returned from the game drive, we were so cold and really wanted something to drink at the bar. When I asked the bar lady for a bottle of wine, she looked at me funny and said she will have to look if there is still in stock. I waited for almost 45 minutes for a bottle of wine..when we asked for coins for the cigarette machine, I was not being accommodated either. The bar lady really made me feel that she was doing me a huge favour in serving me. Only after I had to beg the lady at reception for an arrangement, I was given coins for the cigarette machine...we obviously had it charged to the room (and that was the initial agreement)...the service at the reception desk upon arrival was also very poor. We never received any welcome drinks and when I paid, the lady said my cheque card didn't let the transaction go through at first, but in fact it did. Im a successful attorney and I know exactly how much is in my account. This already made me feel unwelcome....and dissatisfied. I must say (except for the game drive) Im not impressed with the service at Aquilla at all, and don't think that I will come again. There was another gentleman who also complained about the bad service in your lounge-you really need to get more bar staff inthere! Thanx"

They have an awesome kids area with absolutely everything you can think of, even a Microwave. Just wasn't impressed at how this kids area was maintained. We booked the Family Luxury Chalet on Full Board for a long weekend. We had mixed feelings about the Room. It's designed as a Loft room, but the kids beds are upstairs with these very steep stairs that can give you a glimpse into the future of accidents about to happen. Room has no TV, so we didn't know what to do with ourselves at night, unless you happy to go sleep at 8pm with your kids. If you're not the bathing type like us, There's only an Outdoor Shower which was quite a problem in Winter as the temperature is on average 0 degrees at night/morning. However, we did brave the cold and I have to say it was quite refreshing. Same like the kids area, they can do more with maintaining the rooms. Floors are absolutely filthy.The Restaurant was cozy and food was good. They could have had a bigger variety of food & desserts, but not much to complain about. The selection was boring. Same food every day. There was no curries, just one portion of seafood, limited desserts and no ice cream for my kid. The bar area was cozy and the only place with TVs. Conveniently linked to the kids area, so you can grab yourself a drink while you watch your kid go crazy.Probably the highlight of our visit was the Game Drive. Lots of fun watching your kid getting excited to see the Big Five and all the questions that follow. You won't just get to see the Big Five, there's also Hippos, Giraffes, Springbok, Wildebeest and Zebras running around, to name a few. Other entertainment we noticed includes Horse rides and Quad biking. Overall, we had a fantastic first time at Aquila and would love to return in the summer when we sure will enjoy the Outdoor shower in the heat."

Do not expect fine dining - not at all. \"Tired\" looking scrambled eggs and no toast at breakfast.

Another day of sleeping in late, missing yoga and almost missing the trip, repeat of Day 3, pretty much. I was excited as today we had discovered that we could experience wildlife safari close to Cape Town. Since we were visiting South Africa without kids, we had taken a conscious decision of not doing and safari on this trip and we would come back to Kruger or Sabi Sabi later in life with kids. But when we found out about Aquila Safari which is just two hours away from Cape Town, we couldn\u2019t resist and headed there.Now I must clarify, this safari is only good or people who have or are not planning to visit the bigger safaris of the world like Kruger and the one in Tanzania. The number of animals in the safari are few. When we visited there were 2 elephants, 5 lions,2 rhinos , 2-3 zebras and we got to see 2 buffalos (then there are quite a few ostriches and springboks).You are driven around in an open van by the guide. The guides coordinate amongst themselves and follow the trails of the animals and guarantee you a visual of all the big five.There is also a quad bike tour, helicopter tour and you could stay overnight in the reserve\u2019s cottages. Also, although they\u2019ll say that you get to see the big five, truth is that the only leopard you see is caged at the Rescue Centre.You could go to the extent of saying that it is like a glorified zoo. However we had a great time as we did manage to see many animals up close and personal. It was fun to watch elephants fight for food and scary to see the lions so close. Interestingly there were two lions in one pride, which as you know is unusual. Before the safari we were served lunch which had an interesting mix of game meat and vegetarian food. The whole experience along with the two and fro drive takes more than half a day , four hours for the drive and 1.5 hours of safari and some time for lunch. We headed back much happy and satisfied with the experience."

So you will never see the lions hunting for instance as they have nothing to hunt, the whole thing is a santised view of African wildlife set in beautiful suroundings, I was very disappointed with my visit."

We didn't really know what to expect, but we were pleasantly surprised. The facilities are first class and the food and service were very good. We were travelling as a group of four adults and a one year old baby, so we reserved a family chalet. It was large, clean and very comfortable. They even supplied a playpen that we could use as the baby's bed. With the baby, it was difficult to follow the scheduled safari tours, so we booked a private safari in a smaller vehicle. This was not a huge extra expense and it gave us the flexibility to set our own departure and return times. Our guide, Mike, was friendly, knowledgeable and very accommodating. While the animals are fenced into the reserve, the area is huge, so you really do get the impression that they are roaming free. We saw all kinds of animals and thoroughly enjoyed our tours. If you want to see the \"BIG FIVE\" game animals, but either can't or don't want to travel far enough to go on a \"real\" safari, then I would highly recommend Aquila. We are already planning a return visit to Cape Town, and it will definitely include a return visit to Aquila."

            "review": "beautiful place... not that many animals. If you have never seen 'free roaming' animals before, Aquila is a good place... but be aware that the number of animals is rather small. When we visited there were 3 giraffes, 2 elephants, 7 lions, 7 rhinos and we got to see 2 buffalos (then there are quite a few zebras, ostriches and springboks). Also, although they'll say that you get to see the big five... truth is that the only leopard you see is caged at the Rescue Centre. If you keep all these in mind and decide to go... then you'll have a good time. The Reserve is huge, nicely kept and the guides for the drives are knowledgeable. If you happen to go when there is a large group of visitors (when we went there was a conference of some sort) the place looks a bit overcrowded, but that happens pretty much anywhere else. Overall, good deal if you visit in winter (almost 50% discount) but if you have the chance, try any other National Park in South Africa. They might not have the 'big five' but you'll also get to see a lot."

We then sat down to lunch and even though there were lots to eat, it was definitely not 4 star quality... the cheese tasted off, the salads looked and tasted like it was just put in the bowl, the fish was bland. Supper was just as bad, the meat was not succulent at all and the desert, well lets just say the custard had lumps. Breakfast was ok...not like you can mess it up much. Then the issue with the bad service. We were greeted as if they had better things to do:( then when passing management we received no welcome either! I really feel like never recommending this place unless only for a game drive. The only upside was our game drive with Ranger Daniel...He was truly amazing. ..loves his job and so knowledgeable about nature in general. DANIEL, you truly were the only positive - C Anthony"

            "review": "Overnight Getaway. Positives: We found the staff (reception, dining room and game drive rangers) very friendly and helpful. Our ranger (Freddie) is relatively new to Aquila, but was generally well-informed and the game drives were enjoyable. The food overall was above average, home cooked style food. The calmness, and crisp air of the southern Karoo is always refreshing, and Aquila's 7500 ha's is beautiful.Negatives: the title \"private\", coupled with the 4-star price, suggests a degree of exclusivity. It was obvious immediately we arrived that, in fact, Aquila targets the mass market, and there's very little \"exclusive\" about it. The dining room is in real need of a re-decoration - it's not rustic, but rather tacky. Our room (Sunbird) was clean and comfortable, but definitely not 4-star. (I would suggest 3-star at most - finishes like big gaps between door-frames and walls, a bathroom light that is a converted parafin lamp but without any glass, and a toilet that I had to manually fill with water because the ballcock wasn't working, highlight the lack of attention to detail that a 4-star establishment would get right). I was also surprised that there were only 2 elephant (not free roaming), and only 2 or 3 very aggressive (apparantly) buffalo, which I was wanting to photograph but never got the chance! Lions in an enclosure didn't appeal either. As far as the game was concerned, I was expecting a lot more from our visit, and we were very disappointed, no doubt because we have spent much time in lowveld reserves with completely free-roaming game. However, I can see why it appeals to foreigners, and thats good for the economy! In summary, it was a nice overnight stay, and I got a couple of decent photo's (esp of the rhino, actually)."

It is a 2 hr drive to Aquila, but it is through some of South Africa's most beautiful wine country.

We have lunch, supper and breakfast and ate too much.The actual nature reserve was somewhat disappointing as it is extremely small and literally all animals are being feed. The lions look pretty fat and although exciting to be close, it was somewhat less exciting than expected. The private game reserve (even with the big five!) doesn't compare to yourself driving around in like the Karoo National park, where you have a circular drive of 40 odd km. The general experience was okay. but rather expensive even on a special! Wouldn't return. Rather drive the extra 270 km to Beaufort West!"

The chalets are rustic, comfortable and have great touches for want of a better word like an outside shower and sit down bath tubs. (I didn\u2019t use the bath I would have felt bad about using all that water for myself). We arrived after a long journey in the car on one of the hottest days of the year and as soon as we arrived the staff were nothing but helpful. Having booked us all into our rooms they said if you hurry you can still grab lunch before the kitchens close and what a lunch it was too. Arranged in a rather splendid buffet there was a huge selection on offer which was just what we needed after a diet of crisps and sweets in the car. With plenty of time to spare we relaxed by the pool before heading off on our first safari which to be fair was amazing. Besides attending my sister\u2019s wedding I really wanted to go on safari when I went to South Africa and the Aquila Safari more than surpassed my expectations. With fantastic views of the elephants, my personal favourite, as well as hippo\u2019s, giraffes, lions, buffalo, white rhino, zebra and many more, the guide\u2019s knowledge and friendliness shined throughout the experience. After 3 hours out in the field we headed back overwhelmed by what we had seen and eager to jump in the Olympic sized, or thereabouts, pool before a relaxed dinner. Again the evening meal was a real treat and it was nice to sit on the veranda and listen to the animals in the distance. We had another safari lined up in the morning which again was great and we got to find out about the park\u2019s irrigation process for growing their own vegetables and their plans for the future, which I found all very fascinating. Overall I would whole-heartedly recommend the Aquila Safari Park. The staff are excellent, food\u2019s amazing and you do really get close enough to the animals to capture some wonderful pictures and memories. It is also really good value for money."

If you want to see the Big 5 and be assured of seeing them in a short space of time, if time is limited, this is the way to go. It may be a bit commercial (for those of us who are used to the bigger game parks in Africa and self drives), however, this is a little piece of heaven and special time away. It is a good idea for those wanting a bit of peace and quiet to take accommodation away from the main hub. Thank you to everyone who made the stay as memorable as it was. "

            "review": "Aquila Game Preserve is Tops!. This private game preserve has an impressive collection of wild animals that includes all of the big five and a full complement of other animals. The animals are somewhat \"managed\" by the regular feeding from the handlers, but you get to see them in their natural habitat and it is fascinating to see them interact and to see the sense of community that they have at their common water pool. The Rhinos were the most fascinating for me personally and we saw five of them up very close. Also, I really leaned to appreciate the tremendous natural camouflage of a lion's coat in this environment. These animals are wild and one of the buffalo charged one of the game ride vehicles and a young lady dropped her cell phone outside of the vehicle when the buffalo struck their vehicle--it was later recovered! The evening game ride included a stop for champagne and snacks! The normal package here is to arrive around noon, have lunch--meals here are actually very good--in the large dinning facility. All meals are buffet style and you pay for drinks but they are reasonably priced. You get your room key at 2 pm and the first game ride is in the afternoon. You return for dinner, there are club facilities if you want to continue to socialize. We chose to go back to our cabin which was a delightful, rustic and well out-fitted facility with a fireplace with fresh wood and fire starter. I built us a nice and essential fire as it was pretty cold at night in May (the late Fall here). We sat out on our deck and listened to the lions growling in the distance--how cool is that? There are hair dryers in the room, large tubs, double sink and an outdoor shower! All the rooms vary from each other so don't be surprised if you don't have an outside shower. I used the shower after the morning game ride the next day. You awake early and meet around 0630 for a 0700 departure on the morning game ride. After the game ride, you have breakfast and then clear rooms in preparation for departure from the facility. This was a wonderful two day break out into the countryside. Of interest is the fact that the majority of guests during our stay were locals from the Cape Town area--if they are coming here, this facility clearly has a good value proposition for them as well. We really enjoyed our visit here. The staff, kitchen, facility and game rides were all top notch!"

It was wonderful to see the animals, no doubt, but it felt more like a visit to a zoo than a safari in the wild. Added to which we had two girls from Europe,in the front seats of our bus in the skimpiest of clothes, who kept jumping from one side of the bus to the other,taking pictures of each other in assorted provocative poses, which further distracted us from the few animals there were to see! However,our guide gave us some interesting insights into animal behavior, and was informative and cordial, so no complaints on that front at all."

The drive out from Cape Town is easy and beautiful. We had to be there for a 1:30pm safari and arrived well before noon and enjoyed the facilities around the pool and also lunch which was included in the price. After lunch we went out in a truck with our guide (Tyler ? who was great and knowledgeable) and around 10 people on board. We were out for c.3.5 hours and saw a variety of wild African animals up close and personal including elephants, buffalo, giraffe, ostrich, springbok, eland, zebra, rhino and lurking in the water hippos. The lions are in a separate enclosure (which other than the gates in and out is so big you wouldn't notice it's an enclosure) with their own supply of springbok (apparently if they were in the main reserve there wouldn't be much left) !!

Having planned the safari overnight trip from the UK, we opted to be picked up from Cape Town for an extra \u00a350 per person to save the hassle of driving and having a relaxed few days away from busy Cape Town. Unfortunately this was a huge mistake. Despite contacting Aquila prior to our trip for a pick up time, we received no phone call informing us when we would be collected. We contacted Aquila on the day of pick up to find out our driver was 10 mins away. Luckily we were ready and got on board the bus. This was to be our position for the next 2 hours however as our driver proceeded to collect the other guests. Whilst I accept that some waiting is involved, we went to several hotels collecting nobody. Our driver was apologetic and appeared to be taking a huge amount of phone calls with new destinations. We took 2 hours, collecting 3 other couples, but going to 6 different hotels within a 5 mile radius of our pick up point. By the time we had arrived at Acquila we had been on the bus for almost 4 hours. Whilst we were aware we had to wait another 2 hours after arrival to check into our room, this was not ideal given the start to our trip. Having said this the rest of the time spent at Aquila was great, it's just such a shame it started so poorly. I would highly recommend Aquila, but don't bother paying the extra money for transfers. We could have driven there in 2 hours and seen wonderful scenery for far less than \u00a3100."

Since we wanted to see some animals outside of a zoo setting, we chose Aquila as a nice day trip. Our driver picked us up at our hotel on time and from Cape Town it's about 2.5 hrs away. It's a nice drive and goes by quickly. Once there they offer a lovely buffet breakfast and everything is very organized. We had a beautiful day for our visit. The only downfall is that there are no trees on this reserve so it's bit desolate. There's nothing to eat because of this so the animals are fed. Also, the cheetahs and leopard are kept in a small compound instead of roaming on reserve which was sad. The resort is beautiful and if I had little kids or was over 75 yrs old it would have been perfect. Our teens were a bit bored."

Do book the 2 day/overnight option- it allows for afternoon and early am game drive. I am sure you will be guaranteed to see all the animals. Keep in mind the Karoo region isn't these animals native habitat; ;it is sparse land, no natural bush grass or terrain you have in northern SA. However due to the sparseness, you can easily see the animals as they are not camoflouged. The herbivores are fed with grain/hay; it is easy to see large groups of grazing animals. Both the white and black Rhino is here. A treat to see up close. The animals are clearly used to vehicles, they are not fussed about them. The lions live in a separate area fenced off. there were 2 males and 4 females. We saw them up close during the early am drive; it was an amazing experience! At the end of the morning drive, the Ranger takes you to the rehab centre where there are rescued cheetahs and a leopard. the resort itself is comfortable, African d\u00e9cor inspired, and great buffet meals. There is also a fire pit and a cosy African style lounge bar. there is a large pool , and you can sometimes see grazing wild animals in the nearly bush. Internet was weak and the hot water and water pressure in our room was not so good though. This is not an authentic bush safari like in Kruger Park up North, but if one is short on time, and holidaying in the Cape, this is a great way to also get to see Africas famous animals."

EXCELLENT). Such a beautiful, 'wide open space'. environment. Loved it!! A day trip from Cape Town might be a bit much to comfortably enjoy in as it is a 2-3 drive from Victoria Wharf (city), but I was very happy with my overnight stay and would love to return. It was fantastic to see so many animals and even could hear the lion roar at night from our room! The drive back was fine...left on time and took less than 2 hours to return to our Cape Town hotel.Great value for money when converted from Rand to Aussie Dollar."

However, if you are making the smart choice and spending some time in Cape town but don't have time to get to the northern parks then Aquila is a great option. My wife and I were pushed for time after visiting family for over a week in Natal. We were desperate to have some holiday time in Cape Town for our 3 year anniversary. We spent 1 night out at Aquila and were very satisfied with the experience. Great scenery on the drive out, good food, lovely setting and very friendly staff. Our game driver, Daniel, was exceptional and very knowledgeable. Because it is a relatively small park, we got to see all the animals we came for in two game drives. When I say small, 10,000 hectares still feels like plenty of space for the animals to feel and behave as they would in the wild. For a game drive experience that is affordable and efficient I would definitely go back to Aquila."

We did however see Elephants, Hippos, Rhino, Zebra, Lions, Buffalo, Springbok and many more.The facilities were also great. We stayed in the premier lodge which I fully recommend if you have the budget. Our own private lodge with a massive bed, huge en suit (with bath built into the rocks) and private out side shower so you can see the reserve. All staff were friendly and helpful.

Our first visit to South Africa and with limited time available we decided on Aquila to dip our toes in the safari experience for its relative proximity to our Cape Town base. Yes it IS a little ersatz in as much as the space on the reserve seems to limit the capacity of animals, and the rangers all seem to know them individually, but that did not detract from our enjoyment and simply encouraged us to look at the possibilities for a more comprehensive experience next time. Anyone who has looked into the eyes of a couple of lions basking in the sun just a few feet from them will in any event always treasure the experience, as will my wife and myself. The overnight accommodation was very comfortable and the all you can eat buffet dining tremendously good quality. Various ongoing construction indicates there is more improvement to come."

There was 17 in our group (adults and children) all booked for an overnight stay, arriving at lunchtime and incorporating 2 game drives, an evening meal and breakfast. We had 5 sets of accommodation ranging from the family lodges to couples. The experience was very good, the staff extremely friendly and the safari driver of vehicle 10 (during our stay 08/09 April 2015) was brilliant, very knowledgeable about the animals and their behaviours etc. The initial booking in at reception was a little disjointed but this may have been due to the number of people in the party. The food at the reserve was excellent, of a wide variety, very well presented and extremely tasty. The game drives were excellent, and we saw the Big 5 during our stay. The Reserve is still relatively young and it was explained that the programme will eventually allow for a larger number of animals in the future and for the lions to be roaming free, but this did not detract from getting \"up close\" with some of the animals, particularly the large cats, so although there were not a large number of certain species we were not disappointed in what we saw. there were great opportunities to take close up pictures on the camera and video. The morning drive was a bit chilly and it would be advisable to wear warmer clothing certainly until the sun has risen. The game reserve did however provide blankets. The accommodation was excellent, very comfortable well furnished and spacious."

The food was amazing and the range was huge so everyone was happy with something. The park itself was spectacular we had gone to Inverdoorn in Ceres and Aquila I think if you have time go to both as they are both good in their own right but if you want more animals to see and more to do ie small children then I would recommend Aquila as they pretty much have everything and do everything. I loved Aquila but since we went to both parks I loved how quiet and how the game rangers had more time to talk to us in Inverdoorn but other from that they are both good value for money and such an experience so if you have time and the money DO BOTH!!!!!The quad biking safari was incredible it was loads of fun as well as seeing loads of animals the guide was brilliant and saw everything!! We went in March and the weather was brilliant not too hot and was so clear just a perfect experience and I am so glad me and my family decided to visit it was worth staying it makes it so much better an experience than 1 day.

This may not be the Maasai Mara or Kruger national park, but for a day experience it is actually first class. You get to see animals in their natural habitat and the reserve is pretty large, over 7500 acres. We got to see the big 5 - the buffalo being the most dangerous as it charged our truck! The ranger explained right at the start of the tour what Aquila was all about - animal conservation - so full credit to them for that. The ranger was very knowledgeable and kept us well informed about all of the animals. Overall well worth a visit if you are staying around the Cape Town area - we thoroughly enjoyed it and it was a memorable day that will stay with us forever."

We saw *almost* all of the big 5 without having to look too hard. With our overnight trip we were given two lengthy drives for optimal chances of seeing the wild animals.After looking at the other options available in the Karoo for Game Preserves I'm happy wwe chose Aquila. While others allow you to get hands on, we loved that these are still wild animals and are kept happy and natural as best as possible.

We had looked for a good game reserved near to Cape Town while we were in South Africa and Aquila seemed to tick all the right boxes.We opted for the Combo Safari which included transfers from Cape Town, Morning Game drive then an afternoon Horseback/Quad bike.The driver that collected us from out hotel in the morning was friendly and after collecting other guests a round Cape Town he explained the itinerary for our day. He then let everyone know that the bus would be ready to board for the return trip to Cape Town at 15:00 however they would have to wait around till 15:30 as we were doing the combo. With all eyes looking at us it wasn't a comfortable situation but dismissed it and looked forward to the day ahead.On arrival we were met with sparkling wine and juice and staff that didn't look the happiest or most welcoming, this was confirmed when who I can only presume as the manager told the staff that they should smile more when greeting guests!We sat down to the complimentary breakfast which was interrupted by a hungry Peacock who whilst was amusing at first did become annoying and 'pecky' after a while. The game drive started shortly after and the the ranger that took us out was quite knowledgeable of the animals and the surroundings. On the first stop we did see quite a few animals, Elephants, Zebras, Springbok, Rhinos and Gazelles. Unfortunately we only got to see one Lioness who looked a bit hot and was hiding in the bush from the blazing sun. So was disappointed not to see a few more. We stopped for a quick break and was offered water and sparkling wine which also gave us opportunity to chat to other guest and the ranger etc.On our way back to the reception the driver/ranger explained that due to time issues we wouldn't be able to join the others on the visit to the ARC and see the Leopard and Hippos. We did offer to forgo having lunch and remain with the group as quite honestly to see these animals close up was worth skipping a meal, however he seemed insistent that we had to get off as our next tour would begin at 13:30. So we reluctantly left the tour and went to grab lunch. 13:30 came and we stood out by the pick up point awaiting the next ranger to take us out on the next safari. 13:30 came and went. We kept asking staff if we were stood in the right place which they said we were and left it at that. 14:00 came fast approaching and with me and my partner already feeling guilty about making our transfer wait 30mins for us we began to worry that they'd be waiting evening longer. I went back to reception and asked again about when we would start and where to stand to be met with a blank stare and a shrug of the shoulders. It's appeared that no-one knew about who would be running the safari.At 14:10 a ranger came over who asked us to wait a while as not enough Quad bikes had been brought around. At this point I asked him how long this would last as we were concious that a 40-45min late start would mean our transfer bus would be sat waiting with everyone on it for over an hour! He said it'd be about 1.30mins but couldn't guarantee when we'd be back. This left us feeling a bit uncomfortable so took the decision to stay back and not go so we wouldn't make the bus wait longer for us.So ended up spending the afternoon sat looking at hills waiting for 15:00 for the transfer back to Cape Town. While sitting there we looked at the website to check how much we had wasted in cost against the standard morning safari and the combo day safari which worked out to R2200 (About \u00a3125.00 between the 2 of us). Whilst on the website we checked the itinerary details of the day safari against out own. As it turned out the guys on our transfer bus who opted to just do the morning Safari were not due to return to Cape Town until 15:30 and NOT 15:00, so there was no need for that driver to make out that we would have made them wait an extra 30 mins!So we ended up paying more than the guys on the bus who just did the day safari and saw less due to not getting to go to the ARC and instead of seeing the Big 5 only got to see the Big 4.....We did try and speak to a guy there to have a word but he kept brushing us off that he was busy and would get to us when he had a chance but never did. At the end of it feel more upset than angry as we'd travel a long way and that was the highlight we were looking forward to while visiting South Africa"

Thank you so much for alovely stay in your game reserve. right from the start of our visit through to the magical morning trips out to see the reserve, everything was lovely. The selection of food for the buffet throughout the day was excellent and we found the guides very well informed and it shows that they are very experienced. The only reservation was the noise of the renovations, which spoiled the visits to the pool and loungers. but when you were out on the reserve then you could really feel the peace. thank you again from my sister Debbie and iAnn"

            "review": "Not As Advertised.... I have trouble deciding how to rate this...First of all, we had been booked with a confirmed reservation with Inverndoorn. The night before we were supposed to go on the Inverndoorn day safari, I discovered (at 20:00) they had emailed me (after we left the states), that my reservation was no good due to a system error and that they had no room for us. We were to drive ourselves; what if we found this out after the 2.5 hr drive there?!?We got in touch with Aquila as an alternate and had less than an hour to make our decision, but they did have room in the afternoon tour. It was more expensive than Inverndoorn, but they had room, so we booked it after hours.We did the beautiful, easy drive ourselves from Cape Town to Aquila, and it took almost 2.5 hours due to traffic and back ups from road construction. Glad we allowed extra time!Upon arrival, we were greeted with a glass of sparkling wine, juice or water...nice!They did not show my reservation at any of the check ins, but I paid and they accommodated us. Lunch buffet was served before we left for safari drive. Other than being warm in the food room (I was a bit concerned with mayonaise based foods!), the selections were varied and we all had plenty to eat and new dishes to try. I loved the beaded animal heads as decorations throughout the lodge.When it came time for the safari, we were the first in line, were directed to a specific truck, and found our seats. The second truck available, did not fill, but left before us by about 10 mins. with about 6 passengers...not sure what the story was there, since we had arrived first.Upon entering the reserve, we noticed 2 giraffe not far off (close enough for a picture!), but our driver flew past them as if they weren't there. He briefly slowed near some mostly hidden buffalo, but didn't venture to get a better view of them. We sped on to where 2 elephants roamed, and we started snapping pictures from afar figuring that might be all we get of them, the way the tour is going so far! We DID get a better, very upclose view of them, as another little truck was carting a bale of hay to entice them closer. When the little truck left, the elephants came right up to ours to look for the hay and when they realized it wasn't there, they left to follow the other truck with the hay. Not quite the \"wild\" experience I was looking for.We got a good view and photo opp of the lions within their pen area; stopped for a 20 min. sparkling wine stop with no working toilets; saw rhino, springbok, ?kudu?. Some of us noticed ostrich and some hippos, but neither were stopped for. Cheetah were in a relatively small pen across the road. Never saw leopard or zebra.Our driver raced back and was parked at least 5 mins before that other truck. Everything on our tour seemed rushed except the 20 min. champagne break that could have been offered at the end of the tour or not at all. We came to see animals in their relatively natural surrounds, not to have a wine break.On the other hand, at least we got to see some of the animals, and our kids enjoyed the experience. Even though this wasn't cheap, we didn't have time or money to do a \"real\" safari so, Better something than nothing?"

            "review": "Wonderful place to be. This was a magical way to start my trip in SA. Never been to Africa so seeing this place was quite an experience. You arrive at this place which is quite far away from the main city of Capetown and you immediately feel that the long drive was worthy. The infrastructure is interesting. Little huts all around with views to the reserve. Extremely peaceful and really very well done. A little bit run down but it looks intentional to keep in with nature. The rooms are very cute wooden huts with double bed equipped, a wardrobe and a counter. Please note there are no phones in the room to call reception (naturesque I guess - tad annoying if you notice you need something). The rooms have both aircons and fire place to accommodate the time of year you are here and its temperatures. Every huts also has a small front yard with a low table and chairs which is lovely in the morning or night to just relax and soak up the environment. The bathroom has a tub indoor with the usual sink and toilet. There is also an outdoor standing shower which you may enjoy if its not too cold. Really cool! I did two game drives: one in the evening, and one the following morning at sunrise. Great experience. As it is a reserve you feel safe but you dont actually see the enclosure that much. It doesnt feel like a zoo and thus feels almost like a real safari experience without the fear. The guy we had who took us out was extremely friendly and very keen to show us as much as possible. He will talk to you about the animals and their history on how they got here and their individual story. But he is not overly chatty either which means you can also just be in the moment. The animals look healthy and well treated. They seem looked after and protected. They aren't posing for you like in a zoo. In fact some of them are hard to find and see. They have everything: spring bok, hippos, giraffes, rhinos, zebras, elephants, plenty more but those are the highlights I can think of right now. The food in the restaurant is good and service decent. One down side is that at night (after 9pm) there is no more receptionist so you can only get in touch with them after midnight. Also, the little shop they have does not sell what most 'hotels' would have. Don't forget your toothbrush or snacks as they don't provide any! The staff did their best to help though and that made up for it by a mile. All in all an amazing experience which I highly recommend."

So I would definitely suggest a game drive if you want to get close and taking pics will also be much better. I thoroughly enjoyed the horseride but I think Kruger would be a better bet for a real safari experience."

We were unfortunate to have the same guide for our afternoon and morning guide. We firstly were driven past obvious animals and not able to take photos as he rushed. When another member of the vehicle asked him to stop for photos of an animal that he didn't even see he ignored the request. I was very disappointed for my in laws as I had painted such a glorious picture for them based on my previous visit in 2009. Even the gift shop had a poor offering of stock. Farie Glenn next time."

Our guide had loads of information and was very humerous as well, unfortunately forgot his name. If you go in expecting a wild safari you are going to be disappointed. Reading some of the reviews on here it sounds like some people had set their expectations too high. We knew it was a game reserve, there would be visible fences and you'd see cars driving about outside. But it was still a great experience. Ive seen some reviews from people saying the animals didn't do much, its hot and they generally do just sit around most of the day. So we were pleased with what we saw.We were really impressed with the breakfast buffet but unfortunately the lunch buffet wasn't as great but still okay. You also have to pay for drinks.You have access to the pool and other areas which was nice. The shop was nice but quite small and pricey.Overall great day."

As we didn't have the time for a week out there in real African safari, we went for what we thought - based on Tripadvisor's feedback - a decent look-alike mini safari day. Well, we were wrong.So, easily the best part of the day was happening 5 seconds before the 'safari' trip ended, as we were about to cross the gate back into the lodge territory - at this very moment a somewhat sleepy African Buffalo (I think...) got pissed off and was a bit stressed as our truck stopped behind him, got on his feet and ran straight away toward the side of the vehicle and rammed it twice before our driver managed to accelerate. Again, despite the screams of some overly exited people, this was the VERY best of the show on that day...Until that minute, we've seen approximately 2 elephants, 5 exhausted rhinos, 5 sleepy lions looking for a piece of shade, 2 giraffes on the horizon, a bunch of zebras, 4 ostriches, even less monkeys and a few other animals. It was a very hot day, so maybe this added to the drabness of all the animals we've seen that day, but I've visited several zoo locations in the past AND in even hotter days, animals looked a bit 'happier' compared to those in Aquila. A suggestion to Aquila Private Game Reserve managers: ask your driver's to be more engaging on the 2.5h drive from/to Cape Town - the only explanation we (all tourists!) got on the way was that's we're passing next to a shopping mall on the outskirts of the city...!?! hello?? maybe some more useful/informative/interesting information, please?"

            "review": "Big Five (rather four) safari. My brother and I recently visited Aquila Safari and weren't impressed. Having been to one of the other nearby safari game reserves, I thought I knew what to expect. Sadly my expectations weren't met and we felt the park failed on more parametres.We weren't greeted by the staff and generally it all seemed a bit superficial. The Reserve is situated less than 1 km away from a busy highway (N1) which makes the remoteness-feeling disappear right away.The safaris are carried out in busses rather than jeeps/4x4's and the guide should slow down a bit. Too few proper explanations about the individual animals and it was generally too brief. We did like seeing the rhinos and elephants though, which were nicely responsive and lively. The elephants were in fact very affectionate with oneanother. Biggest disappointment (and read this well now) we did not see the lions! Basically the lions enclosure is a rather small,hilly, mountain terrain \"cage\" where there is only one main path to drive at. This means that the likelyhood of getting close up with the lions in this reserve is really small. The lions hid on the mountain side and the guide did his best to persuade us, the we could actually see the head of the lion male in between the rocks, but neither of us had eyes that good. I'm guessing we were 150-200 metres away (as opposed to my prev experience with a closeup encounter of 5-10 m)I would not recommend this game safari and I can guarantee there are better alternatives close by. Oh and yes, Aquila say there are less than 2 hours away from. Cape Town. Good luck to reach there in less than 2.5-3 hours."

They were building a new building and a drain. This makes very much noise and made our stay around the swimming pool impossible.

Please, please, please if you read this understand this is not the Masi Mara or Kruger. What you get is a taste of a safari experience within easy travelling of Cape Town that delivers on all levels. We booked a one night stay and transfers and had an exceptional time and I would have no quams recommending this venue to anyone. Transfers were seamless and trouble free, the staff friendly and attentive and the lodge we stayed in was clean with everything you would want in a stay at an isolated reserve area. And that's the point, it's not 5 star hotel luxury, it's a chance to stay close to the animals and in the calming isolation that comes with its location. If you want animals, a casino and every facility known to man then visit Las Vegas !! Aquila gave us everything we hoped for in a game safari experience, lions, elephants, hippo's, rhino's and many more. Our guide Yanni was informative and did everything he could to ensure everyone saw what they wanted on our two drives. His passion for the wildlife was clear to see and no question was unanswered. The facilities in the evening and when you are not out in the reserve are excellent, a great pool, good bars, very tasty and varied food and a night sky unblemished by light pollution that I will always remember. Thank you Aquila, we had a great time and I wanted to try to put the record straight. Please visit if you want a wildlife experience that I guarantee you will always remember. It does what it says in the brochure so understand that before you book and you will not be disappointed."

Although they do have quite a few rhinocerous and hippos, springboks, handful of buffaloes.Becuase they are also accepting day tours for tourists coming from capetown, arriving at about 1pm - 2pm is a mad house at the reception counter. Too crowded and the game drive which was about 2.5 hours included a surprise stop with champagne and snacks. it was a nice gesture although we think its becuase there isnt too much to see over there.Staff were helpful and polite which is the positive side of the safari.

            "review": "Enjoyable, but disorganised..... Our stay was lovely and my family did enjoy it, however I have to point out some failures sadly. I was coming to Aquila with my 3 year old daughter and family from England. I specifically checked the schedule with your staff on numerous times, even arranging for dinner to be made available at 5pm for my daughter. I was told repeatedly this wasn't a problem, that my daughter could eat dinner early after our game drive (which was scheduled for 3-5pm) and that a note was made on my booking and reception would be aware. Upon our arrival reception had no idea what I was talking about, no note had been made of my request as promised. Reception then informed me that i'd been repeatedly sent the WRONG schedule, and that the game drive wasn't until 4pm and we would only return at 7pm, this obviously was quite a concern as not only was it considerably past my daughters meal time, but also her routined bed time. The person dealing with our check in wasn't overly helpful, couldn't suggest an alternative and had to ask a colleague for help, I then asked if a food parcel could perhaps be made up for my daughter, I was told to just take extra \"bits\" from lunch! Not ideal, how on earth can you take a meal on a 2-3 hours game drive in 30 degrees temperatures. It seemed nothing else could be done so I had no other alternative than to do this...thankfully someone gave me a plastic, albeit broken, container to put some items in. This wasn't the start I had wanted for our stay and was one I had tried to avoid by various emails and phone calls checking and rechecking everything, it was hugely disappointing I have to say.On a separate point, we were sitting at the back of the truck and sadly could hardly hear our guide, perhaps moving forward Aquila need to look at getting your rangers mics/speakers in the trucks to rectify this... I also feel it was rather poor that on the second early (6am) game drive no blankets were provided/offered. Someone brought them out just before we left but never handed them out or placed any on the truck....everyone was absolutely freezing, even being dressed warmly. Finally my parents were staying in lodge 25, the 2 person cottage, and whilst they thought the cottage was kitted out lovely and was pleasant the lighting walking back to their lodge in the evening was almost non existent and rather dangerous, I don't know whether this was an issue purely that evening or whether there simply isn't enough lighting but either way was quite dangerous."

The welcoming drink was a dreadful cheap glass of luke warm carbonated white wine - undrinkable. The inclusive buffet lunch was acceptable food but the restaurant was grubby and very tired. The game drive was pathetic. We were herded onto a clapped-out truck and driven around in circles in an attempt to make us think it was a large reserve. The animals were few and far between but clearly used to the poor tourists dragged around their enclosure to photograph them. The drive was about 30 minutes worth squeezed into 2 and a half hours. The ranger did his best to inject some interest but even he seemed to lose the will to live by the time we thankfully lumbered our way out of the park. We did not see lions or leopards apart from a few sick ones kept in a small enclosure near the BOMA.Overall, it was a poor experience and left us feeling cheated. Save your money and go to the zoo or save up your money and go on a real safari!"

            "review": "Great fun. As long as your expectations are set right, this place is great. This place recommended by my cousin (a CT native) with children. For us, it was about showing the children (7 & 9) some animals on a trip which was entirely based around Capetown. Essentially it's a massive safari park with a few giraffes, a couple of elephants, hippos, ostriches, zebra galore, eland, springbok, gnu, cape buffalo, white rhino.... There's even a pride of lions kept safely separate from the rest. I was amazed at just how much wildlife they have here and the significant space in which they roam. You can focus on the negative (occasional sight of trucks charging down the road alongside the park rather shatters the otherwise complete illusion of remoteness) but why bother? Aquila does a great job efficiently processing a large volume of people. Stay overnight so you have a game drive evening and early morning. I heard them talk to day visitors who turn up for lunch then have a 1.30pm game drive. I get the feeling that if you came all this way for a just 'OK' lunch and then a game drive in the baking hot middle of the day when the animals are all hiding would be a bit of a disappointment. And to be honest, the impression of the clientele I had after lunch (people baking themselves in 1pm 30+ degree heat with beer in hand) was the least favourable and was gradually replaced by my more positive impressions of the place/the experience and the staff during the quieter late afternoon/evening and early morning. Meals are buffet style. Lunch was a very busy affair what with many day visitors and the quality of the food I think lower but still decent. Dinner also buffet but for perhaps a fifth the number of people and much better quality - very nice beef, couple of decent cheeses, etc. Wines good & inexpensive. Breakfast first rate. "

We stayed overnight and the room was nothing like what we expected or as they described. They provide repellent which is nice of them as its needed!

The facilities are really pretty but the game reserve was the same as the visit to the zoo for me, just much, much more expensive. We booked the horse riding tour that suppose to last something like 2 hours. We were waiting for our horses to be ready for more than 1h and then rode after our guide into the reserve. We made one circle around the reserve, not even stopping properly to make pictures and finished our ride in about 30 min, without seeing most of the animals - we only passed few giraffes, zebras and rhinos from a distance. Afterwards we were taken in some kind of 'zoo' to see one cheetah and 2 crocodiles. Not impressed at all with this experience, i felt kind of tricked. The reserve is small and it's obvious this is not a real wilderness, it's more like a zoo where all the animals are behind the same fence. The good aspects are the little hotel is really lovely, with very nice outdoor swimming pools and grass to lay around, and the food served was very good."

He was so knowledgeable about the animals and the reserve. He shared information about the animals behavior, diet, environment. It was fascinating. I was interested the entire drive. One our first drive we saw Buffalo, Hippos, Elephants, Springbok, Antelope, White Rhino, Giraffe, Lions...Tyler was great about getting close to the animals so that you could get great pictures but still respecting the animals and their habitats. As far as the hotel goes, the cottages were very cute. Mine wasn't very clean but my friends place was. The food was a delicious buffet with lots of options. You were greater with a welcome drink and refreshments on the first game drive. Nice pool...cold but refreshing when the sun is out. My only complaint would have to be the transport. It is quite expensive and the first van was a very right fit. They were very late picking us up and I was headed to the airport which made for a stressful end of the trip. I did however make it to the airport on time and the reception staff was very kind."

We booked 2 rooms for 24th & 25th January 2015, Only one room was available at check-in time (14H00) and we were made to wait in the one room until 15h30 before the other room became available. At no stage did anyone communicate to us that the other room was ready, we had to discover that ourselvesShower water supply stopped midway during a shower at 22h30 in one of our rooms.We found soiled linen sheets on the king size bed in one of our rooms. It appeared to be faeces marks and blood stains. this was at about 23h30 and there was no one from housekeeping to attend to the problem.We reported our experiences to the Front of House Manager the next morning and was advised to send an email to the relevant person at the Aquila H/O. We were informed that an investigation would be done and feedback would be provided the following week. Three weeks have now passed and we have still not received the promised feedback nor any apology.We were able to see the big 5.Descent facilities for the kids.Staff at reception and in the restaurant were friendly.Food was enjoyable."

As a South African I feel that showing the big 5 in the hospital recovery section is NOT really seeing wildlife. I concede that once in the main park you could potentially see lion but you really needed imagination to see them in their caves !The rangers spoke very softly and could not be heard ! On their way back to the starting point the drivers had a race and we kicked up dust at about 50km per hour !The restaurant was excellent and the buildings attractive. But this does not justify the huge sum of money charged . R1500.00 per person . Shame on you for fleecing the overseas visitors like this !!"

Honestly, there are better zoos and Safari parks in the UK than this!When you arrive, the restaurant and surroundings are lovely, so you think it's going to be a brilliant day. But, the day gets worse from there.You're taken around in an open sided truck. We first came across two elephants and we did learn a few facts. As we were sitting by the elephants, a few springbok came by and everyone started taking photos. The guide told us not to bother taking photos because we would see loads of springbok during the day...we didn't see any for the rest of the day!We were then driven about 30 seconds to where one single giraffe was eating from a box of hay hidden behind a rock. This is when we realised this was not what we had expected. Stupidly I thought it would be a free roaming game reserve like the pilanesburg but it really wasn't.The fun bit about a game reserve is when you drive around and everyone is trying to spot the animals. None of that excitement was there because it was like the animals were fed in a specific place, and then we were just driven to where they were standing. The lions were in a cage in the middle of the reserve and they were not particularly happy to see us. There was a small boy in our group and the lions saw him as prey and were stalking and growling at him. The poor boy was terrified...I was terrified even though they were behind bars.I wouldn't recommend this game reserve. I have had better days out at The Knysna Elephant Park or Monkeyland.If you are expecting a natural environment and to go to try and spot the animals then go for a day pass at one of the big game reserves. This was a wasted day out for us!"

Your camera is a MUST!It was great that there were several times offered for the game drives.The weekend stay from Friday till Sunday was exceptionally good regarding driving times and activities at the Reserve.The least appealing - which did not spoil the overall visit experience - , could be mentioned as our game warden. He was jovial, and knew a lot about nature, but he seemed to be 'rattling off' the information which he was giving as though he had learnt it off by heart and was in a hurry to get to the next lot of tourists and his next game drive.The best, was the tranquillity of Nature itself, where the animals (other than the capture area) roamed quietly and naturally as though they were in the wild veld, unobserved :-)"

The Lunch was good before we went off on the Game DriveI did not think the Game Reserve was all that they advertised because I did not see any giraffes or buffalo. Although I was disappointed, I did not say anything because of the American and Dutch tourists who enjoyed the first sighting of Hippos. We saw a new born Hippo (well only his tiny head from a safe distance) and his mum (at a separate waterhole from the other hippos). I have been to many reserves in the Western Cape and most of them have Lions in enclosures because they would kill off the rest of the game. The Lions at Aquila were lying in the shade and they looked healthy. I identified an Orynx (from a distance) and we saw lots of Zebras, some Rhino and elephant/s.I am only doing this review now because:On Saturday 17 January 2015 we passed a \"field\" of solar panels. My son wanted to go up close but the gate was locked. He then enquired at Aquila (entrance) across the road and as it turned out it was part of their electricity project. I told him to tell them at reception that I had been on a game drive on 22 March 2014. Without confirmation of my being there, a guide was assigned to take him across (to the solar project) by vehicle at no charge. When I went to reception the gentleman said I looked familiar (because I always talk a lot?) and it was confirmed that he had attended to me on 22 March 2014."

After that 2 crocodiles in a pond three times their length. It was aweful seeing all these animals suffer in the heat without any chance of parole.Then the real \"reserve\". A 300 hectare small animal park in a desert like environment without shade. All animals seem to rest at the same place all the time all day as we found the big five in a juffy. 6 lions, 2 elephants, 3 giraffes and 3 rhino's. And some antilopes and zebras near an artificial \"lake\". Thats it. Do the owners have no shame? Looking at the Aquila website you would expect some more but what we have seen there is beyond any respect for the animals. Maybe children can be fooled as they are without criticism. To please the adults, halfway the game drive ( thats how they call this farce) a glass of bubbles is served as if the owners want to prove beyond doubt that we are dealing with a fake.If you have any self respect and respect for animals then do not go there. It will save you 200 euros a couple as well."

It was very hot in the afternoon and animals are in open sun all day motionless because of the heat on the dry arid open plain. The captive animals in the so called rescue shelter seem to be there only so the game reserve can claim that they have 2 crocs, 1 cheetah and 1 leopard. The captivity pens are so small it was depressing to look at. Food , accommodations, swimming pool and overall facilities are good, although paying for drinking water seemed unfair. Attraction rating would be higher if greater concern for animal welfare. I get the sense these animals are not necessarily native to this region and were transplanted for tourism, so arrangements should be made to give them some shaded shelter considering its all about the animals as to why we and other tourists were there."

            "review": "Fantastic overnight experience!. Having read the previous reviews, I was a little scared of what we would be experiencing. I have done the big safari parks in Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe so am aware of the difference between Aquila and those; however, I thought Aquila do what they do very well. We did the one night stay which, in my opinion, is more than enough.I was brining my boyfriend along who had never had a proper African Safari experience and had never seen wild animals up close before and he absolutely loved it. For some of the people who have no previous experience of the true game parks (where you could go for 6 nights and never see a single one of the big cats) this at least ensures you will see every single one of the big 5 albeit in smaller quantity and not necessarily together. If your aim is to see them roaming around the bush and hunting, this is probably not the experience for you and you would be better off spending a little extra and stopping off at Kruger or Maasai Mara or even Nakuru.Onto the main review now! The food was absolutely excellent! The buffet was great, tons of variety which was lovely. The lodges (we stayed in 15 & 16) were great with a lovely outdoor shower and a separate bathtub in each room. Be aware they do have ACs but I was able to use ours as such and it acted more as a fan. Still, as the weather was great, it was not really needed. The two pools were also very well maintained and we had a great time inbetween activities having a dip in them so make sure you bring your bathing suit!The game drives were fantastic, with our super guide Tyler. The jeeps/trucks were well maintained and great to drive in. The guide was knowledgeable and friendly. The animals are, indeed, used to seeing humans driving around so will not run away the moment you spot them and you are able to get very close to them which some will love and some will not. I am part of the former category. Yes, some of the cats are in enclosures (the cheetahs and the leopard) but look well taken care of. I reserve my judgement about this for now and will see in a few years whether they have in fact gone through with it and brought them out into the main area of the park.All in all, a great time for those who don't have the time to stop off at the larger parks.Downside: for people without children, the rides can be a little annoying if you have to do them with other people's children. We had one child with us rides on both who kept swinging on the poles of the roof of the car and kept kicking me, my boyfriend or the people sitting next to him because he was horribly bored. He was also quite loud, shouting at the animals, etc which definitely takes the edge off, especially when you're trying to hear what the guide is saying. I really think people with children would probably do better riding with other families who have more tolerance for this. Although I have to say that as children we were often taken on safaris with my parents and we never behaved like this."

Aquila does what it does well, and that is to offer access to the Big 5 within 2.5 hours of Cape Town in a safe and not too spoilt environment. But bear in mind this is not the romantic safari you might have dreamed about - for that you will need to pay a lot more and travel much further, but that is not a criticism of Aquila. So expect lots of people at first. The lunch hall had 150 people eating and we thought we'd hate the place. But once the game drive started the 5 trucks cleverly went in different directions and kept out of each other's way. The guide Abrial was fantastic and deserves some kudos. They don't have much game as the park is 7500 hectares, but they have enough: elephants, 5 rhino, 7 lions, lots of kudu etc, 2 recovering cheetahs, zebra, quite a few hippo. Because the animals are so used to the trucks, and because the area is sealed off with electric fencing, you can get very close to the animals in a place which seems to care about the animals a lot. We stayed the night but lots of people were on day trips. I'd recommend staying the night but not 2 nights. The food was good, and the rooms were fine. So this is perfect for those in Cape Town who haven't been on safari much and it is very child-friendly."

Sure, you'll see the \"Big 5\", but the big leopard is in a one-acre cage as are the lions you are most likely to see. In my mind, the reason this is not a true safari is that these animals are not existing in their natural ecosystem. The lions are completely separate from all the other animals in the \"reserve\". I asked our guide how they ate and he responded, \"we feed them twice a week\". Meaning they never hunt their prey because there is no prey within their (albeit large) cage.All that said, if you're looking for a quick day trip where you wake up early and are home by mid-afternoon with a hundred pictures of pretty animals, this is a great option."

The only problem is the Western Cape is not exactly the best place to see \"the big five\" or indeed many of the other animals that are better known to live in Natal or the Kruger area in the north. I had fairly low expectations but I have to say Aquila exceeded them. On arrival at 9am, (2 hours drive from CT), we were greeted with a morning drink and then a full buffet breakfast. The camp is clean, tidy and picturesque and the hotel rooms look good, some of which over look a watering hole. There are 2 swimming pools, one has a bar/infinity pool and there is also a play area for children including a crazy golf course - 9 holes, although not in the best condition.At 10.15 we were put into a 20 seater truck with a drive/guide called David, who was very knowledgeable and passionate about the park. We were able to see many animals including all the big 5. I might add, the lions are in a separate part at this time and the leopard is in the rehabilitation centre, but this does not detract from the experience and the work Aquila are putting in place. After the drive, there was a buffet lunch (drinks not included) and some time to use the pool and relax. The children enjoyed playing in the kids area and the golf too. Overall, it was a great taster to viewing wildlife and I would recommend it. I would say that 1 drive would be enough unless you switch to the riding or quad bike for a different experience. It might not be the place to go if you are an experienced game park goer though."

They picked us up from our hotel at 6.20am and it was a two hour drive to the reserve. The journey was long but the views were breathtaking. When we arrived at Aquila we were really impressed- it's in a beautiful setting. We were told to have breakfast and then given free time before the safari started. I felt there was too much waiting time and although it was a beautiful setting we just wanted to get on with the safari. The safari was great and we got to see four of the big five. The one animal we didn't get to see was the leopard, and there was no explanation from our guide as to why we didn't get to see it or if they are even at the reserve. After our safari we were taken to a conservation area which I thought was quite poor really. It seemed unfinished and we weren't given a great deal of information about it.Following this we went for lunch which I thought was superb. It was buffet style with lots of choice, very tasty and good quality.After lunch we had more free time (around 1hr30) to go for a swim, chill out etc. although it was a beautiful setting and the lodge was stunning, the pool area was packed out with people doing the safari and as a result there were no free sun loungers and the pool was full of kids. We ended up sitting on hard picnic benches literally waiting to get back on the bus to go home.Although I enjoyed the safari and loved seeing the animals I just felt there was a lot of 'dead' time hanging around. It annoyed me that we had to be picked up at 6.20am and then wait for 2 hours at the reserve for the safari to start. It just felt like time wasted that I could have spent longer in bed! And I could have quite happily headed back after lunch. It was a beautiful place and I couldn't knock the food, that was superb but overall I think they drew out a full day into something that could have been done in half the time."

The Reserve caters for the mass market but having said that, the food is very good as is the restaurant service and staff. I did not like the big vehicle (23 seater) as this was uncomfortable on rutted roads. The standard accommodation is basic but acceptable even though the ceiling fan was problematic and the outside shower floor had to be swept before use due to small thorn like droppings from surrounding trees. This area was never cleaned and on one day our chalet was not serviced by housekeeping either. The horse ride through the reserve was stunning and is highly recommended. The pool is awkwardly designed as the steps are at the restaurant side rather than on the lawn side where the recliners are positioned. Generally, the staff are friendly and appear to have a passion for what they do. This Reserve is worth a visit."

            "review": "Expectations. We came here for a day trip particularly hoping to see the different flora/fauna of the fynbos region as this was the first time we visited the Cape Town area. Please note that our expectations were somewhat high having been on various other safaris within South Africa and Kenya, not as high as those locations could offer, but still for a \"Big 5\" reserve, we did expect something different. First of all, upon arrival we saw the large \"people mover\" game vehicles which immediately gave us pause as we did expect more of a normal 10 seater vehicle. I immediately enquired regarding a private vehicle, and after lunch, was told yes it was available. It wasn't very expensive considering the difference it should offer in the experience, so whew, thankful for that. Lunch for the day visitor is buffet, food is ok (drinks not included in the price, not even water), but we're not going for the food, are we? Enough said probably about that.The game drive started out ok as the flora is much different. I will mention we did see 4 of the Big 5. But when you see two buffalo just to be told that those are the only two buffalo or when you see elephants to be told they are the only two elephants, same with two giraffe (young giraffe) whom they are hoping will survive as their natural diet of acacia is still being grown, not to mention that the lions are in their own enclosure and fed by the reserve, then yes, it was disappointing.I know now that the lions were rescued from canned hunting farms and for that, it's a noble cause. But they aren't really \"wild\" animals then if they are being fed inside their own (albeit large 500 hectare) enclosure, and I think the marketing should not slant it as such, it should be called an \"animal park\", not a game reserve. And due to the small size of the \"reserve\", I know that there can't be a huge load on the natural vegetation (so they do provide supplemental feeding). But expectations were high, and reality did not quite deliver. It did have more of the feeling of a drive-through animal park, than a true \"game reserve\". I'd like to consider the motives of this park as being for conservation and that all tourism fees are used for such. So hopefully one day they will be able to have a fully functioning \"wild\" reserve where supplemental feeding is not needed and enclosures will be opened. Until then, just understand it for what it is, and if you have the proper expectations, then enjoy!"

As this was our third trip to Cape Town we fancied doing something different without travelling too far from our base with friends in Hout Bay.Aquila met the brief perfectly. While maybe not an truly authentic safari it was pretty close. The Rangers were extremely knowledgeable and the setting is spectacular. The lodge is comfortable and the design is sympathetic to the landscape. Hopefully the building extension currently underway will not spoil this.The food is plentiful and tasty rather than 'haute cuisine' but after building up a huge appetite the buffet was just perfect. Drinks are cheap - our bar bill was less than \u00a330 including wine, soft drinks and cocktails over a day and a half.Particularly enjoyed the additional horseback safari and the offer to go back out for a canter after we had returned to base with the non riders - thank you!My only suggestion for improvement would be the pre-arrival information. Since we made our own way to the lodge and were held up by roadworks the journey took longer than the \"2 hours from CT\" advertised (closer to 3) and we were slightly stressing to get there by 12 thinking we would miss out on the afternoon safari - only to find it didn't leave till 4pm and we had plenty of time for lunch, check in and lounging by the pool. As we were only there for 1 night we chose the most basic of the rooms which was perfectly comfortable and clean. Didn't use the fire but I imagine it would be very cosy.Highly recommended and great value for money. Our friends in Hout Bay have booked on our recommendation."

It does not take much suspension of disbelief to feel like you are seeing the animals in the wild. Very much enjoyed the day there."

After that we entered another area an saw only one giraffe. From there they took us another area where are the elephants but we got stuck there cause the truck was so heavy and it was so sandy . We waited almost 30 minutes to help us . After that we went back and the took us to the animal rescue and we saw 1 tiger and some cheetahs after that they just took us back to our cars .

Two-hour van ride, then a very nice buffet breakfast, and then out on the truck to see animals. It is a private game preserve, so it is likely that you will see a wide assortment as you are driven through (but not guaranteed). Our guide was very personable, and we got great pictures of rhinos, zebra, ostriches, and farther-off shots of everything else. Make sure you use the facilities before you head out, for there are no restrooms while you are out with the truck. Then back to the home base for a delicious lunch; you have to pay for beverages at lunch, but the prices were very reasonable. Another 2-hour ride and you are back in Cape Town. Remarkably convenient, and very much worth the money."

How could you have the Lions in the same enclosure of a reserve without them eating all the Zebra. We saw all we wanted to and dared to step outside the vehicle and have a sherry until a Rhino came too close for comfort. To be in an open vehicle next to animals I have only seen behind cages or relatively small enclosures like Longleat was an amazing experience. To have a private suit or villa with an open air shower was liberating. Good food and friendly staff. We even enjoyed the picturesque drive from Capetown. One minor criticism of Room 17, dont start the fire in the cabin. The smoke doesn't extract very well and everything will smell like a bonfire for a day. I think it because the log burner has plates for cooking on the top which allows smoke into the room. We had to leave the windows open all nights to avoid too much smoke inhalation. Otherwise a very enjoyable experience."

Breakfast buffet on arrival was adequate but nothing special. Staff were slow to refill empty platters;4.

He won the second star in our rating;5. Buffet lunch was not very appetising and for such a high price, it was surprising that drinks were not included;6.

The mini van was already 3/4 full so some picked up 0545 onwards.The driver was courteous and efficient. Most of the drive I slept which was a blessing as the roads into the hills were quite perilous. We stopped for a snack, toilet break at a service station on the way about 1 hour in to the journey.. Good timing. The reserve itself was pretty disorganised. On arrival you sign a waiver have breakfast which whilst welcome was quite average food wise. Then there is a wait until the game drive start at 1015. I had a look at the curios shop... Prices were outrageous. The game drive however was EXCELLENT. Our guide was fabulous... Chatty and knowledgeable about the animals. We saw wilder east, hippos, rhino, zebra, giraffe, elephants, lions in the distance, springboks, no cheetahs ( nocturnal). It was awesome! On return we had lunch but had to pay for drinks which felt like gouging given the price already paid and after the drive hot and thirsty... Not even water provided:(...... Then not much to do until collection at 330. There is a pool , not enough seats around for the guests outside of the dining area.Luckily our driver returned early and all of our 10 guests were happy to leave early to get back to Cape town. Would I recommend it... Yes to see the animals was amazing.... I think it would be better if shorter... Early return straight after lunch with mid afternoon back into Cape Town would be way better."

Eventualy Michelle got hold of me and since then it has been excuse on excuse and that they will get back to me and that this and and that that one is not avaialble. I wrote her her on 14 October, requested for feeback on 17 October, again on 24 October and 29 Oktober and again op 17 November with still no feedback, not even when I will get feedback.Below puts my experience in perspective.I want to put our Aquila visit into perspective. It was meant to be the highlight of our honeymoon. We have been dreaming visiting Aquila for many years and finally made the booking. From the outright we were disappointed. I can elaborate on each point but these are the items in summary.\u2022 Only Semi-Sweet drinks on arrival and on game drive. No dry drinks like Sauvignon Blanc.\u2022 Very rude receptionist, told us to go and wait outside till its lunch time.\u2022 No shade outside for the amount of people that were waiting there. Eventually we went to the bar (nobody told us about it) \u2022 Ordered two cocktails and the barman told us to wait. 30 min later he brought us the wrong drinks (1 of the 2) and insisted that we must take it.\u2022 Lunch for a 4 star game reserve reminded me of hostel food.\u2022 We finally got to the room and tried to close the curtains as there is no shade in the front. The curtain rails fell from the wall with multiple holes in the wall.\u2022 After our game drive it was back in the wall but it was clear that a piece of firewood was used to hammer it back into the wall that was thrown underneath the outside table.\u2022 Room is clean but nothing to write home about. There were candles but no candle holders to use them.\u2022 The game drive animal sightings is very good. What I don\u2019t understand is why the driver would drive up to 5m away from rhino\u2019s lying down until they get nervous and jump up. Surely 15m or more away would not disturb the animal? The game drive vehicle is poorly maintained, the fan belts where screeching and chirping away all the time. This could be fix quickly and for cheap.\u2022 There was not enough water during this hot day on the game drive. Several children was complaining of being thirsty.\u2022 The evening meal was a great disappoint with the same food (90% of the lunch) being served again. There was not even ice-cream.\u2022 Nobody was around to take our drink order and we had to run after people to help us.\u2022 We cancelled the morning game drive but the receptionist just put our room number down and never even checked.I can go on for long but this should get the message across. Aquila was the most expensive part of our honeymoon (compared to other game lodges and hotels) and it was the biggest disappointment. Poor service, poor experience and with no attempts to make it better. It was our honeymoon and not for one moment did we feel special despite the high prices. We left before 8 the next morning after we cancelled the game drive and we informed the gate that we are not having breakfast. Nobody seem to care nor did anyone bother to contact us about the Samsung charger and our own two point plug that we forgot (yes, there were no two pin plugs in the room)I feel that I was robbed from that was supposed to be an exceptional experience. I will give you the opportunity to advise if have the wrong perception of Aquila before I post this on Trip Advisor as per the mail I got from Aquila."

I had made a few special requests like accommodating us with single beds and organizing a special cooler box on the game drive etc, everything was taken care off just as requested and with such professionalism and care. The only thing that we were not accommodated on is I had wanted to by Aquila caps for everyone for their arrival, but the shop was out of stock.Out of the 12 people in our group, 8 had never been to a game reserve before so for them to have a life changing experience in such luxury was very special. We had dressed up as a group for Halloween and we so enjoyed the interaction with the staff etc. Our game ranger Timothy was brilliant! The reception staff were welcoming and pleasant. The kitchen staff and waitrons were efficient and helpful. Our rooms were spotless and very comfortable.A very successful Team Gilded Edge evening away, Thank you Aquila!"

            "review": "Not impressed at all!. Visited Aquila on a day trip from Cape Town. Pick-up (organized for us by Aquila directly) in Cape Town happens between 6 and 6:30 am depending on which hotel you are staying at. Leaving Cape Town at 6:30 we arrived in Aquila at 8:45 with a 10 minutes stop on the way. We arrived and were served breakfast but safari did not start before 10:15 which is a total waste of time (90 minutes!!!) and makes such an early pick-up totally unnecessary. I would have been happy to leave town later and have a quick breakfast on arrival or even have breakfast at home and arrive on site at 10:00, just before safari time. Now when I say safari, is only because they call it like that but for me it is nothing more than a \"wild zoo group excursion\". I say that because 1) we were 19 in the vehicle (can accommodate 22) and 2) the few animals they have are surely to be found every day at the exact same place. 2 elephants in total, found by a water hole (surprise surprise); 4 giraffes in total, only one we saw, right by the tree where they feed them of grass and carrots (surprise, surprise); etc... In addition of the 2 elephants and 4 giraffes, they have 3 cape buffaloes, a few zebras, wildebeests, elands and other general game. The lions, our driver said we were \"very lucky\" finding and he did insist on the \"very luck\". But actually they were by a water hole inside a fenced (and electrified) area which itself is inside a bigger fenced area which itself is inside the main reserve which of course is also fenced so it takes a total of 3 gates to get to the lions. With that, probabilities that they escape the morning tour bus are low, if not non existant. After the tour, our ranger took us to the ARC (Aquila Rescue and Conservation) area where they keep, within fenced \"cages\" 2 cheetah, 1 lion, 1 lioness and 1 leopard. You are welcome to take pictures with metallic fences in the foreground as well as in the background. Around 1:30 we were back to the main lodge for lunch. My friend and I had booked a quad bike tour at 2pm and was great fun but we only came back at 4pm while our departure time was scheduled at 3:30. We did not mind it at all but I am not sure the other passengers of the mini-bus we were travelling with were very happy about the wait, especially knowing they had not been doing any afternoon activity (the standard day tour at Aquila finishes with lunch, followed by departure at 3:30 and I was the one at booking who pro-actively requested an afternoon occupation... so a lot of wasted time here again for most visitors). So overall a big disappointment and an attraction I will not recommend to anyone around me. My friend was happy because she saw lions for the very first time but seriously, this was by no means a safari and unless they work on their schedule, it is a total waste of time. There is way too much to do around Cape Town to afford spending 4 hours waiting for the sake of waiting."

The guy who took us on both our game drives, was very patient and was constantly on the look out so that we could see as many animals as possible. At no time did the drive feel rushed and we had plenty of time for photos. Rooms were great and we particularly enjoyed our outdoor shower at 6am.

The General Manager was a pleasure to meet with his passion for the future of the reserve and the community projects. The ability to observe the animals in such close proximity was humbling and falling asleep listening to the lions roar was just incredible. Really puts life into perspective."

We thoroughly enjoyed the game drive and were delighted with the the plate of treats and drinks we were received during the adventure. The food was tasty and accomodation beautiful. We had lovely weather which I was grateful for but part of me also hoped for a cold night so that we ould make use of our fire place in our room but I can imagine that would have been cosy and romantic. It seems like Aquilla Private Game reserve is a well thought out establishment. The only suggestion I wud perhaps make is building a stand for guests to climb on and off the horses as that was quite a challenge for beginners. Lol. Thank you for the treat, even though it was only one night, my hubby and I came back relaxed and appreciative of our beautiful country again."

In addition while otherwise the smaller reserve area with animals can feel a little contrived it was genuine enough to be a great experience for those with kids that don't have the patience to drive all day with the risk of not seeing an animal. On the negative side the food was not that good and we noticed what looked like reusing of food from previous meals (presumably to cut costs)."

The Chalet we had was very nice, clean and comfortable. We saw elephants and springbok from our balcony the morning we checked out and tons of animals on the afternoon and morning game drives which made for incredible photo opportunities. I have been to Kruger National Park as well and barely saw any animals, I overheard other people on the tour that said the same thing. Of course Kruger Park is enormous so animal sightings can be rare. The great thing about Aquila being a smaller reserve is you will see animals and that's the whole point. The staff was very friendly and courteous and the food was great. There is also a very nice lounge/bar area with fire places inside. The drive to the park itself is exquisite. If you plan on visiting Cape Town Aquila Game Reserve is a must do activity and it's only 2 hours from the city! Highly recommend. Thanks for creating a memory that will last a lifetime."

I did the combo overnight - 2 game drives and a horseback safari.I had an enjoyable time, but I enjoy myself anywhere - within reason.This is not so much a safari as an outdoor zoo, and it feels like one too. The lions are fat and sleepy looking. Still that said, you get to see all the animals - so it's worth it in that regard. The horseback safari is lovely - but the website is misleading unfortunately. \"A slow walk across the plains or cantering at full throttle is at the guest\u2019s discretion\". I'm a rider and was looking forward to cantering. This is NOT allowed and so a rather chilly slow pace walk ensued. The food is fantastic and the service fine. The whole place could do with a bit of an interior uplift. And change the music in the restaurant! Overall - average."

Four of us went for a whole day, which began with a glass of champagne to greet us; a superb buffet breakfast in a gorgeous restaurant, and time to wander round the grounds before we took to our safari vehicle (seating about 12) for a guided drive out into the reserve. Our wonderful guide knew everything about everything there! Imagine being almost within touching distance of lions, rhinos, zebras, giraffes, hippos, elephants, ostriches, springbok and various other creatures in the most spectacular landscape. We even had a stop half way round for a glass of chilled champagne in the sunshine! We went back for an excellent buffet lunch and as much time as we wanted afterwards to chill.There is the opportunity to go out on an escorted safari either on horseback or quadbike, or a day combining these. Tours finish up in the ARC rescue centre where we saw cheetah and leopard.There is accommodation there, some in thatched cottages where you might find elephants in your garden, and they will organise transport - which I think is complimentary - from Cape Town hotels. There are two swimming pools, too!Unforgettable. Memorable. There just aren't enough superlatives."

Myself and my family stayed for 2 nights at the Aquila and it was fantastic we were well looked after and the safaris were excellent and very well organised, with excellent guides we saw the BIG 5 and the whole experience I will never forget. I had booked 2 lodges and they were great with a log fire fridge and bathroom with here we go an outside shower (when I say outside its an open roof) which when I saw it I was taken aback but it was great as the water was nice and warm and this was in itself an experience. The lodge had a fantastic swimming pool but when we were there it was a bit too cold to use the lounge bar was good with log fires burning which kept it nice and warm.And now to the food it was simply the best. The hot Breakfast Lunch and Dinner was so good and Lamb and Beef stew was to die for the women who cooked and served the food were so nice and could not do enough so much so when I had the stew the portion over ran the plate. There was also a number of staff serving drinks and removing plates. Drinks were not expensive and the staff was always on hand to clear the tables.The only thing I would say is wrap up well if you are on the early safari as in September it\u2019s still a bit cold around 07:00am in September but get down to this place at least for a day."

This is quality as its best , anyone who has been there raves about it=true story.Friends who have been here say that it is an experience in a million. It makes all the stress of day to day life in Cape Town worth it. This is an experience you are not going to want to end. The prices are VERY economical and it is an experience like no other. Best of all is it is situated near CAPE TOWN what more can you ask for? One moment you are in the hussle and bustle of daily life in the city and the next you are on your own private adventure....filled with all the best that south africa has to offer. THIS WOULD BE A DREAM COME TRUE xxx over and over and over and over again.It is places like these that make life worth living. It makes the stress fade away. A getaway to a magical destination filled with wildlife. True story last year I went to a little place near Cape Town and saw a giraffe for the first time at the age of 30 I fell in love and no jokes when I tell you that since then I have bought a huge giraffe carpet for my lounge, a giraffe necklace , anything giraffe I can find. There was only 1 giraffe and I was sad that it had no friends. I would love to experience nature at its best where wildlife has friends....I will fall in love with the animals and be in my happy place. Never been to a game reserve and after the year my boyfriend and I have had, this would be the ultimate.....should we love it which there is no doubt we will. we will return yearly. We are looking for a special place not to far from the cbd to be \"our place\"....this reserve could be it....P.S I have been dying to see elephants......especially baby ones"

Because we wanted the safari experience but were unable to visit the more well known Kruger Park, we booked ourselves on the day trip safari to Aquila Private Game Reserve. It was an early morning pick up from our hotel, but watching the sun come up as we drove through the Hex River Valley was a treat. There was a degree of confusion on arrival as our group was not given any indication as to what to do. So we helped ourselves to a glass of welcome drink and went on through to the dining room where we enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast. After breakfast we were divided into groups and boarded our safari vehicle. Daniel was our ranger/guide/driver and he proved to be very experienced and knowledgeable with a great sense of humour (his imitation of a big cat had me going). Upon entering the reserve we stopped to watch the water buffalo while Daniel told us how dangerous and unpredictable they were. Mid sentence he stopped, and recognising a change in the stance of the animal leapt into the driver\u2019s seat and took off while the water buffalo charged and hit the vehicle. WOAH that was scary! The rest of the trip was not quite as eventful but definitely awesome as we were treated to sightings of springbok, gnu, zebras, hippos, rhinos (in and out of the water), elephants, giraffes, a lioness and of course the water buffalo. We also visited the Aquila Rehabilitation and Conservation Centre where I was particularly impressed by the work being done there. (In residence at the time was a cheetah and leopard). The location of the reserve was stunning and their philosophy of responsible tourism sat well with me."

Trying to enter the area to do a game drive was a treat as some of the animals stand at the gate waiting by the looks of it for the \"big escape!!\" The guides were knowledgable and informative. We got to stop under a tree and enjoy a glass of bubbly with snacks while enjoying the surrounds. We saw lions up close and walking along a \"koppie\" looking majestically down on us, hippos bobbing in the dam, Zebra, various buck species and elephants up so close, you could see their beautiful eyes. Sun started to sink and we sat watching how the Hippo's, Rhino's and buck stood together eating Lucern (it was dry so extra food is provided for animals). Food was great and a nice variety to choose from. I braved doing a Horse back Safari (little bit wary of a horse) but had so much fun with my riding companions and guide.

The staff was really nice and they were really trying to give a quite unique experience and comfort us. The accommodation was also really cosy, with a fireplace and what I especially liked was the stone-look shower which was outside and you could see the sky and it felt like showering in nature. If you have done many safaris and game drives you will probably be bored at this reserve because the routes are not too long and you see animals on really every game drive you do. At the first game drive we were a little bit disappointed because it looked like the animals would always be at the same spots so we did not really feel the wild life. But on the next day some animals were somewhere completely else, some we did not even see anymore and especially the lions on the second day were stunning and so interesting! When we left they moved up the mountains and all the animals seemed really wild and healthy. The buffet was also above average and the surroundings were just beautiful. If you are in Capetown for a short period of time then I would definitely recommend a stay at aquila. If you are on the other hand staying longer and can afford a trip to Kruger Park that would be for those who really can go on a full day safari where you are lucky if you see any animals."

From the start, I was very impressed with the professionalism of the booking department \u2013 in spite of the time difference, they replied to all e-mail questions and requests within a few hours, were efficient and accommodating. The driver arrived to pick us up from the hotel exactly at the scheduled time. Staff at the preserve itself is knowledgeable, accommodating, and efficient. This was my first experience with an Organized safari and I was not sure what exactly to expect, but I found the accommodations and food at Aquila beyond reproach. Guides at Aquila deserve a special mention. Not only all of them are very knowledgeable in biology and behavior of wild animals, but also highly dedicated to their work, to animal conservation, and educating of visitors. I highly recommend booking a horseback ride through the preserve. Mine was one of the best horse rides I had."

Deserts were not great in terms of choice. Game drives were long enough to see all the animals but guides were very shy. Guides did not educate visitors about animals and environment. Only basic comments. No excitement shown or not very enthusiastic.ARC centre too small for leopards and cheetahs. Felt sorry for these great cats. Accommodation facilities was excellent - however no warning about yellow/brown water coming out of tap - my bath was yellow and brown. No drainage in showers - or bad drainage of water if shower used.Mid afternoon- there was no staff behind the bar for over 2 hours - waited and waited for someone.The itinerary was wrong on our morning game drive.

We were greeted with a glass of bubbly and then had a great buffet lunch. Our evening meal and breakfast were also lovely. The dining room was stunning - a large straw roof and wood African building with log fires ( they were needed in winter!). As there were 3 of us we had a bungalow - it was gorgeous. Our own log fire, a gallery second sleeping area, corner bath, patio looking out over the reserve. Nice attention to detail eg when we got back from the game drive the turn down service had been in and turned on our heating and put hot water bottles in our beds. That brings me on to the game drive - don't expect the Serengeti but prepare to be overwhelmed by the beauty of these animals in a natural environment. It is a huge reserve and the animals wander freely within this area (except for the lions who have their own area, but that's understandable). It was a struggle to get up at 0630 for the morning drive but it was well worth it. Our guide was so nice and very knowledgable. To summarise, we loved this experience. Try and stay, rather than just doing the day trip, so you get the overall experience."

It is not a large game park, so we weren't particularly surprised to find zebra, cape buffalo, hippo, elephant and giraffe all within about a mile of the lodge gate. Not particularly wild, but it was exactly what we were looking for with two young kids eager to see as much wildlife as possible, and two parents keen to keep the driving to a minimum to avoid a meltdown! The drive into the lion enclosure was a particular highlight.The food in the huge restaurant building was a buffet service, which was fine - though a larger selection of meal options would have been nice.All in all, Aquila was exactly what we had hoped it would be."

Less than two hours drive from Cape Town it's extremely convenient for visitors to the Western Cape and also has the benefit of being in a malaria free area. We chose an overnight stay with evening and early morning game drives and opted for one of the premier cabins separate from the main lodge. The accommodation was first rate, in a very quaint but superbly comfortable African style. The buffet breakfast and lunch was very good although the dinner we had was pretty disappointing and lacked choice. As it was pretty quiet (mid winter - July) when we were there maybe that was due to a relative lack of guests that evening. The game drives were very good with very knowledgable and patient rangers. We saw a huge amount of wildlife including four of the big five and overall had a great experience. We were a bit disappointed that the lions were in a separate enclosure although it was pretty big. Seeing lions so obviously fenced in took some of the gloss off but, we felt better when we heard about the conservation work going on to save and rehabilitate this beautiful creatures and were pleased to hear that the plan is to release them into the main reserve in the future. If you are not heading to Northern Natal or the Kruger, this is a great option with fantastic wildlife and quaint yet luxurious accommodation."

We therefore are scouting out a game reserve which has the big 5 and is close enough to Cape Town. It cost us R1500 pp to stay here (winter special) which included a standard chalet, three meals (all buffet) and two game drives. We arrived at 12.30pm as per the instructions and were given an arrival drink as they said. The arrival drink was a bubbly from De Doorns and I have to say, this was plonk. Here you have visitors from all over the world coming to this amazing reserve, we have over 600 wine producers in SA and you choose a sparkling over Methode Cap Classique (MCC). Please don't judge SA's \"sparkling wine\" from this one glass. Order a MCC at the next chance you get!! Or go for the sparkling grape juice. The thing that also annoyed me about this, is the package is quite pricy (esp for a local), so you would expect MCC on arrival and not sparkling?!! So next we go to reception, everyone was friendly but nothing OTT. We go through for lunch as we cannot check in until 2pm (as per the schedule). Lunch was buffet, it was a stunning day so we sat outside. With this we had no cutlery but we got some eventually. The main meal was a lamb Potjie (stew) and it was delicious. I ordered a glass of Robertson Chardonnay after the meal and it felts like a good 20 minutes before I got it. Service i therefore felt was not really up to scratch. We checked in to our standard room and that was pretty much correct. The fireplace didn't seem to work as we very quickly had a room full of smoke. We had to run each piece of wood under water to put out the fire. Our bathroom was pretty nice, but i am not a fan of outdoor showers, especially in winter. The bath was lovely though. We then went on the game drive, and this was pretty good. Unlike at the Kruger National Park which can be a bit daunting, especially if it is your first time, this place felt pretty safe and you can watch the animals at a leisurely pace and safe distance. The lions are in a separate section which is cool because you get to see them, but in a way the lions are just living in a big fenced off area. After three hours of driving around we went back to the lodge for dinner, also buffet. This was also nice and there was plenty to choose from. They have a pretty shocking wine list, i would love to suggest an alternative list to showcase SA wine at various price points!! When we got back to our room, they had turned on the lights and the heater and even made a towel in to an elephant (bonus points) which was all very nice. Next morning we unfortunately didn't go to the ARC where you can see the lions, cheetahs and leopards but I imagine that would be a highlight. Buffet breakfast was fine, though i am curious to know what they use for the bacon. Our seats also had bird poop on them and our salt shaker was empty. Small things go a long way and in a four star lodge, i would expect these things to be in order. Overall it was nice, but I am going to continue searching for the ultimate big 5 experience close to Cape Town."

Wonderful guide on game drive but we missed the second game drive as it was at 7am as we had our 2 year old daughter with us so it was too much of a rush."

We arrived at the reserve at around 9:00am and had breakfast before our first game drive. The game drive is in an open vehicle with around 15 people. The driver stated several times that he hopes to deliver on seeing all the \"Big 5\", so we were excited about what we would see on the drive. The first part of the drive we seen springbok, zebra, rhino, buffalo, etc. Then we pulled up to a electrified fence and was explained that the lions were separated from those animals because the reserve was only 13 years old. I thought ok maybe that made sense. Then we pulled through the fence and found that the lions were in another fenced in enclosure. Then we went past the lions and seen two giraffe and two elephants in the open field. The cheetah and leopards were across the highway in fenced in enclosures. Needless to say this was not the African Safari we had expected. These animals were being fed by the reserve staff, not surviving in the wild like it had been represented. This is nothing more than a zoo. We have been on more realistic game drives in the U.S. than this one. Being in Africa we expected animals living in the wild and hoping to sneak up on them to see them. The excitement and little bit of danger associated with finding animals in the wild was what attracted us to a safari. We did not come here to see a zoo. Anyway, we arrived back at the check in area and we had had enough. We did not want to waste another 30 hours of our vacation at this place. I asked the lady at the front desk if we could ride back with one of the afternoon transfers that day and she said she would check. After 15 minutes or so she said there was not any room. She said they would not refund our money for the room or rest of our trip. I told her that was fine we just did not want to be there any longer. I said how could we get back and she said I could pay $R2500.00 for a private transfer. I said that's what I wanted. It was not until this time that she asked me why we wanted to leave. I told her it was not what we expected. That was it, no more questions. No one seemed surprised or concerned that we would want to leave. I ended up spending $R7690.00 for one trip aroud a zoo. Beware that their website extremely misrepresents what your experience will be like."

            "review": "Aquila to improve their standards. Overall trip was disappointing as we stayed for 3 nights, which is too long as there is nothing to do there. We enjoyed sitting in the lounge during the day and at night however it took a long time to receive drinks and the resort has no board games or cards for guests to keep themselves entertained with. It would be lovely if the resort had a pool table and a dart board to keep guests busy. The bonfire was lovely for the 2 nights we requested it be lit, although told on the second night that they weren't going to make a big one...irrespective whether guests ask for a bonfire or not, one should be lit to encourage guests to bring hot drinks and marshmallows and congregate and share wildlife stories. Most staff were polite however we felt that they were not prepared to go above and beyond what is expected of them, this is very sad considering Aquilla is a 4 star resort. Guests felt like they were burdening the staff by asking for another round of drinks. The resort is lovely and so much potential to do better however we were there during off season therefore not everything was available or in use, this is very sad too considering that the northern hemisphere countries have they're summer holidays at this time and visiting SA in the winter is a pleasure and the cooler weather is welcomed. So basically because it's their off season we aren't entitled to those guests that pay full rates during off season.The games drives were enjoyable especially the little picnic set up. Unfortunately Aquila should not advertise themselves as a Game Reserve but rather a Game lodge with tame animals or a conservatory with wild life. The lions are kept in an enclosed area and are very fat, hardly think they can hunt for themselves. Other wildlife come in pairs; 2 elephants, 2 giraffe, 2 buffalo etc. Overall it's a great place for tourists who have never seen wildlife before and it would only be recommended to stay for one night so you feel the full effects and leave satisfied."

The lodge and operations are very good , the food awesome and standard accommodation good in summer but cold in winter unless you know how to use a coal stove. also the hot water supply to the room does not sustain two people in a short time. The game viewing for us was average in that we are spoilt safari exponents , the lions are not free range but are beautiful , two elephants , hippos are great and the leopard is not free range so you do see the big five but not all in natural habitat for good reasons I may add. However once you have done two game drives you have seen it all and so would not recommend a stay of longer than two days.perfect for visitors to Cape Town who have not seen the big five before or experienced say 7 days on open bush lodges."

We saw everything we were hoping to see and the only reason why I gave it 4 stars (would of given 4.5 if it had that option) is because it is very controlled and not as wild as the Kruger Park but on the plus side you are almost guaranteed to see what you wanted to see and get amazing photos. You will also learn a lot about the animals as the game rangers have a wide knowledge of the animals. The food is fantastic so make sure you get there with an empty stomach."

I have never seen such sad lions in my life and I've been to the bush countless times. A dead baby hippo lying next to it's mother, 2 young elephants forced into a boma overnight. We were told that 2 giraffes died because they starved and didn't adapt to a clearly unadaptable area. NO TREES? We felt this was clearly a sick money making operation (hugely expensive although luckily we didn't pay) geared at tourists who want to see the big 5. I can completely understand a rehabilitation park or sanctuary for animals with no where else to go - but the fact that these animal were paid for and most from the Kruger Park up near Mpumalanga - which is a completely different terrain - it just broke out hearts. Keep your lovely accommodation and gear it to something else. But put your big 5 back where they belong... in the real bush. Unfortunately we will never come back or suggest anyone else do the same. It has scarred us."

With both people in our party who have grown up visiting game reserves in southern africa, as well as europeans experiencing a reserve for the first time, I can truly say there is something for everyone. I can also say the value is excellent ( we live in Cape town and are not visitors with pounds or dollars)."

Whilst we all knew deep down that this was a fenced reserve - it was so huge (miles and miles and miles) that it felt completely natural. Animals that we had only ever seen in the confines of a zoo in the uk..And they all came to greet us that day - giraffes, hippos, elephants, rhinos, lion, tigers...An hour and a half in we stoped for a break - and the champagne (or soft drink ) came out again, which by then was very welcome - unfortunately, it also meant that a few needed the loo - so remember, this trip is at least two hours long!!After a couple of long, dusty, bumpy albeit enjoyable hours in a plank seated truck - we arrived back at base where yet another huge buffet lunch awaited us, with multiple choices and puddings galore!!A great day out!"

The bucket was sufficient for 2 flushes of the toilet.We returned from the Game Drive to find the water issue still remained (toilet had been cleaned). We went for dinner & were provided with keys to another room should we want to have water! Unfortunately we we're just too tired & with a pre-dawn start for game drive & the prospect of moving cots/baby equipment/luggage we just crashed out. In the morning the situation was the same, returning from the game drive & after breakfast we had cold running water.I mentioned the above to the General Manager, no compensation was forthcoming, he mentioned an ongoing problem with 'Water Security' issues that they were trying to resolve. We booked a Family Room at their 'Winter Special' overnight rate, it included Buffet Lunch/Dinner/Breakfast & welcome drinks. From memory the cost of accomodation was approx 1,900ZAR p/p a total of just over \u00a3200uk/U$300, this seemed very poor when taken in context of the discomfort of lack of water, notwithstanding the offer of a separate place to shower.Had we not had the water issues or had been offered some concession towards our inconvenience I would not hesitate to rate Aquila very highly & good value for money at that price.The staff were very Courteous, the lodge looks fantastic & is being improved, the room/bed was very comfortable. The Game Drive was interesting within the context of a managed Game Park & on the afternoon 'Safari' we were provided with canap\u00e9s & sparkling wine.The buffet food was hearty & tasty but I wouldn't say outstanding ( good by rest of the world standards but given the outstanding food in South Africa I'd say in comparison it was OK/Good, certainly not disappointing), dining is in a large hall with an open fire.Middle of winter wrap up warm, especially for the morning Safari!Despite our disappointment & lack of compensation, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Aquila, be aware of their admitted 'Water Security' issues. Not all rooms were affected during our stay."

            "review": "well-meant. In a situation like this where you are a captive group like the animals driven around a relatively small circuit the experience is critically determined by which ranger you get - what stories they tell, how much knowledge they have, the quality of discussion possible. Just looking at the animals in the absence of information is not only disappointing, it makes you feel exploitative, like a zoo, when this new form of animal reserve, a function of wealthy tourist interest, may be the only way these creatures will survive in future. Top quality ranger knowledge and communication skills are key - unless you just want mindless photos. We almost cried when we we put on the 'wrong' truck with a silent, non-fluent ranger, who could not answer our questions and who did not understand our interests, and named the animals and their genders plus a few facts about pounds of food and gestation periods and that was it: we could see the other truck's engaging speaker, who had so much to say. Lost a night's sleep over this - our one time only, big expense, maybe never in Africa again. Either give everyone experienced rangers, or figure out how to spread the good communicators/knowledgeable ones (Timothy) around, or find some way to allow tourists to self-select - those interested in knowing a lot, from those interested in the (luxurious) surroundings - food and pool - and photos."

As for the \"game drive\" - it was good fun but hardly a \"game drive\" as the reserve lacks the numbers of animals we have seen before.

We stayed in one of the cabins above the river/stream and had a perfect view of the hippos in the river, almost below the cabin. Our cabin was an interesting mix of rustic stone and restrained luxury. We brought our own shampoos and soaps but decided to use the biodegradable ones provided as suggested on the information sheet - these were of really good quality and compared favourably to the salon shampoo I use at home. A well-placed fireplace in the room kept it warm and cosy on a cold evening; the in-room wine, hot chocolate, coffee and tea was a treat after dinner and before the morning game drive. From the moment we arrived we were greeted and dealt with in a really friendly and professional manner. The buffet meals at the restaurant were all delicious and service at the restaurant matched the service we experienced throughout our stay, from the lady serving welcome drinks, to the reception, the barlady, porters, and especially our lovely guide, Michael. Aquila is not the Kruger, but it is under 2 hours from Cape Town in a lovely part of the world, and we were able to experience rhino, lions, elephants, hippo, and several other animals up close and that was a great experience, especially for our children (age 10 and 15). I would love to return in summer to sit outside and take advantage of the patio and pool area."

I am not one to typically write reviews, but my family and I were so troubled by our recent experience at Aquila that I felt compelled to prevent potential visitors from the same terrible experience.  We arrived from Cape Town to Aquila for the day trip safari. Main problem: There were barely any animals to see. Two elephants, some springbok and some hippos. That was it for our safari ride!! When we arrived to the area of the lions, we didn't even see one! All you can see is vast dry landscape. You honestly will benefit from going to the zoo instead. Our entire jeep group including my family was angered. I have never seen such trickery and false advertisement. Bottom line: There are no great safaris near Cape Town. I have been to Sun City early this year where the Pilensburg National Reserve is located. That place was great. I have also been to the Hwange Safari in Zimbabwe; great as well. There is no substitute for natural reserves versus these artificial game reserves."

We were a really big group of more than 150 people. The location was really really great. It was awesome specially for us coming from a tropical country. The staffs and the drivers were very accommodating and kind. We had the game drive tour for about 1.5 to 2 hours I think. Since we are a big group, waiting time was also included in the drive time. The tour guide/driver assigned to our group was knowledgeable on the things he discussed about the major animals we saw. I just wished that he also threw in some information on little creature we saw during the drive. Most of the details discussed would be for the big animals (and of course the big 5) that we saw. Information that we would likely see through google search or NatGeo, but the thrill is you get to hear those facts while seeing them and getting close to these creatures a possible. It would have been better or maybe the best if we've seen more animals, whether it be big or small.The facilities they have are great. I also liked the food. The garden, the pool and whole place in general is awesome. I think it was breathtaking. The people are okay too. Kids would definitely enjoy this place, specially those who lives in an urban place. A safe way to see wild animals as close as possible. I just don't know what the lodges is like since we didn't stayed there' over night."

            "review": "\"taste\" of safari. Just 2.5 hours from Cape Town, Aquila is easily accessible for Cape Townians and tourists alike. I highly recommend staying one night in one of the small cottages onsite as your stay will include a morning and evening game drive which are well worth it. Day visitors enjoy the midday game drive but it tends to be hotter and more crowded at that time. I have visited for a day trip and stayed a night on a separate occasion end I really enjoyed the late afternoon game drive on my second visit. Meals are included in the price - day visitors get a lunch and ever night stay gets a lunch on arrival, dinner and then breakfast the next day. We saw all of the big 5, though the leopard was in a cage as she had been rehabilitated from a hunting lodge and could no longer live in the wild. The reserve is large and though you know that you are in an enclosed area - the cottages and main lodge are separated from the animals by a fence - it is not as small as some of the other private reserves.Our cottage felt very luxurious, with an outdoor shower and a huge, comfortable bed. After dinner we were greeted by a towel shaped into an elephant on our bed, which was a really nice touch. There is a pool onsite and I wish we had arrived earlier for our lunch to have time for a swim before our 3pm game drive. A convenient way to see some animals while staying close to Cape Town!"

I was as well. The breakfast and lunch buffet was nice. On the safari ride, we did not see any lions. If you come to Africa specifically looking forward to a safari, I would look elsewhere. This is more of a rehabilitation place. To see the cheetah (1) you had to get out of the jeep and walk along look through the chain fence. We did see 2 elephants, Ostrich, Springbok, 2 Rhino, 1 giraffe, and the eyeballs of two Hippo that were underwater. From Cape Town it took four hours roundtrip. A lot of travel time and cost for this place. The lodge/pool was very nice. seemed like good accommodation's."

The guide we had was very informative of all the animals on the reserve and it was interesting to hear details of these wonderful creatures. It maybe a little artificial since the animals are effectively in captivity and they have to be fed but the reserve is very large and the animals roam around so it is not at like a zoo. There is some accommodation which had we known we probably would haved stayed given the tranquil nature of the surrounds. It is a wonderful experience for all ages and the champagne at 8:30am following a long drive from Capetown was a nice way to start the day!

Dinner was awful, poor selection and when we arrived around 8pm the mussels starter had run out. A visitor from Belgium told me she had been at 7.30pm and they had already run out then. I went to the back where the staff were standing doing nothing and asked for the dish to be replenished. this was done willingly and a few minutes later the lady came out with a bowl of mussels and stirred them into the sauce of the serving bowl on the table. We took some and so did the Belgian lady only to find they were STILL FROZEN. Our game ranger Mike was also a let-down, he didnt give proper photo opportunities and rushed us back at the end of the drive because he had spent too long at the drinks stop chatting to some young guests. the accommodation was good and the breakfast also good as was lunch, dinner a disaster and the buffet area looks like it could use a good scrubbing of the walls and maybe a coat of paint."

I had a very enjoyable day but for anyone thinking about visiting you should have your expectations in line as this is not an \u2018authentic\u2019 wild life experience. If you are looking for that type of trip you need to visit a different area of South Africa. If, however, you simply want to see some of the Big 5 near Cape Town in a semi-wilderness type environment Aquila would be a great place to do it. I\u2019m an avid horseperson so taking the horseback safari option was a no brainer for me. Even if you\u2019re not an experienced rider at home I\u2019d recommend considering it. Being free from the roads the trucks use allows you to see more of the reserve and to wander closer to the animals. It\u2019s also a less intrusive way to view them. I was surprised how close we were able to get to the zebras and other grazers without spooking or seeming to bother them.The guide was a quirky and chatty fellow and I really did enjoy riding with him. On the downside I found in my follow up research that several of the animal facts and tidbits he provided weren\u2019t entirely accurate. So if you want a somewhat educational day trip this may not be the place for it. Remember to take the teachings \u2018with a grain of salt\u2019. I took the shuttle transfer from Cape Town and in retrospect I would have planned it differently. The shuttle picked me up at 6am and after a couple more pickups we were on the road by 6:30am and arrived at 8:30am. The ride didn\u2019t leave until 10:30am so I had a couple of hours to kill. The rides are about 2.5 hours long (although the day I visited we happened to stay out a little longer) and the shuttle didn\u2019t leave Aquila to return to Cape Town until 3pm. It would have been better to rent a car for the day and self-drive. The reserve is easily accessible, the roads are good and car rentals are cheap. The shuttle transfer was more expensive than a car and GPS rental would have been so if you\u2019re confident driving in South Africa save the wasted time and drive yourself."

We stayed overnight at the Game Reserve so we didn't have to rush off after the game drive. Upon arrival we were greeted with a glass of sparkling wine, the children with sparkling grape juice, and then directed into the reception. As we were overnighting, our check in was after lunch. All meals included in the package price, drinks were extras. Lunch was buffet style, so all you could eat, freshly prepared and plentiful. After lunch we checked-in and our lodge was brilliant, it even had a fully working log fire. Our first game drive was in the afternoon and our guide was knowledgeable and friendly. On returning to the lodge, we were greeted by about 8 hippos in the poll opposite, separated from the lodge by a fence. Dinner was again buffet style.We were up early the next morning for another game drive, with the same guide and just as good as the previous evening. We saw the big 5 over the two game drives. Returning to the lodge we had breakfast and checked out to return to Cape Town.Overall a great two days the place is child friendly and a great intro into game safari's.

The park is not humangous but very easy to see all animals. in two hours in the park with a great guide and a sparkling wine stop in the safari park we we happy. good food, nice pool."

Range of animals disappointing and knowable guide kept telling us that more would arriving in 3 months but that seems hard to believe. 2 Cheetahs and only 1 leopard in separate cages and might as well be in a zoo. Lions were a highlight but again in separate enclosure and over weight. Overall the service and food was great. Children loved the buffet. However the animal experience was disappointing but we have experienced Kruger in the past and this is no replacement for that."

Highly recommended for a family excursion....and not bank breaking at all. Basically we appeared to be virtually guaranteed to see the 'Big 5'. In any event the 3-4 hours or so provided us close up views and photo opportunities with Rhinio, Hippo, Elephant, Lion, Cheetah and Zebra. There were others including the Springbok. Combined with an upbeat driver who truly loved his job.The late lunch that followed was 'man size'. Great staff from initial phone enquiry to gift shop on departure. The BadA long long drive from 7am; 2 1/2 hours rather than 1 1/2 from Constantia, Cape Town, that we were told. Probably because we are not local and drove slow?. Not a bad drive assuming you have driven a hire car in foreign countries before.The UglyThe Osritch....what can I say? ..a perfect experience that left me with no reservations on any front whatsoever!"

The underside of the toilet seat and the bidet were dirty. We did not use the bidet during our visit.On the first safari in the afternoon we were unlucky to be allocated to a truck containing a number of american families with young children. I love kids but these were so noisy and their parents so oblivious to the concerns of others that we could hear nothinbg of the commentary from your driver. We asked the driver to speak up but his response was come and sit closer to me (we were a party of 5).The next morning, we specifically asked to be separated from the americans and your manager made sure we were on another bus. the driver and guide was much better than the previous day and was knowledgeable about the animals and spoke up engaging us with eye contact which the previous driver had been unable to do.My daughter got engaged whilst we were there so I ordered a bottle of South African sparkling at over R300. Unfortunately, this was 2008 and had lost most of its sparkle, so after dinner I complained and was given a bottle of house red wine. Sparkling wines must not be stored for extended periods and certainly not 6 years!!!I would never go on your safari again unless you segregate parties with young children from adults. They naturally get excited and noisy and if not disciplined by their parents (as in the case of the americans) just spoil the learning process for us adults.The food in the restaurant was good and the choice above average, but the ease of access for wild birds poses a serious health risk as they were free to feed at the food for human consumption. As a resort, this was a top priced attraction. It simply did not match up to the price paid and I would not recommend it to a friend"

The animals are prepared to show up at certain spots - easy to catch them while they are getting their food. For the hundrets of tourists with limited time this might be great, but for people who want to see the animals in a more natural envoirement it's pretty boring. The chalets, the restaurants, pool and the staff are great. "

            "review": "Game for adventure?. Our overnight \u201csafari\u201d at Aquila Private Game Reserve was not quite what we expected, although we are glad we did it. We saw all the \u201cregular suspects\u201d, i.e. lion, Cape buffalo, elephants, rhinos, hippos, plus various others including springbok (springing!!), gnu, antelope, ostrich, giraffe and zebra. However our evening game drive was cold and wet (we were huddled in blankets and ponchos that were provided). The morning game drive was worse \u2013 wetter and colder! After a night of heavy rain we woke in the dark to no power in the cabins (a regular occurrence judging by the candles and oil lamp provided). The drive was less than 2 hours as there was not much else to see and we were all anxious to get back to the (excellent) breakfast! Our guide called it \u201cthe worst game drive ever\u201d\u2026 However, what about the place? Well, Aquila is like a safari park, such as may be found in the US or Europe, on steroids. Of course, what not everyone realizes is that all game reserves are managed, to a greater or lesser extent (somewhat greater in the case of Aquila). Aquila covers a large area of the Karoo and is reasonably green with low bushes and a few trees. It is quite hilly. The animals are wild, but used to humans as they are fed from a truck (of course I would not have wanted to be as close as we were to a rhino that was not used to humans!) The lions are in a large fenced area, so they do not eat the other exhibits (except when an antelope jumps in by mistake)\u2026 The lodge is quite nice. We were in the cheapest cabins which were a little basic but with a quite nice bathroom (large tub and outdoor shower for those that like such things). However not all participants were fully prepared for the experience, perhaps taking the \u201cluxury\u201d description of the lodge a little too literally. Our cabin was about 200 yards from the dining room and lounge buildings (both very nice buildings). One lady broke a heel on the semi-paved walkways (don\u2019t bring heels to a safari) and not everyone thought to bring flashlights (we always travel with a flashlight). Our neighbor couldn\u2019t find the matches, and his light source (read, \u201ccell phone\u201d) died as he was getting dressed. He was lost when we found him trying to find reception. The food was very good and plentiful (buffet style). There were some local dishes, Staff were friendly but there was not much management in evidence (i.e. an apology for the lack of power overnight would have been a nice touch). While coffee was available before the morning game drive, there was no one with it to tell us whether the drive was going ahead, until the trucks arrived. Bottom line \u2013 do it but don\u2019t expect too much and you will be pleasantly surprised (and maybe it won\u2019t rain\u2026)"

This is a private reserve based 2 hrs drive north from Cape Town in the Karoo desert.We arrived midday for a buffet lunch then checked into our cottage which was very comfortable with Queensize bed, ensuite with corner bath and outside shower! The evening safari started around 4.30 and lasted 3 hrs including a glass of bubbly at sunset. Saw all the usual suspects and in a very wild habitat. The guide was very friendly and informative. Came back for buffet dinner. Lovely food with lots of South African specialities. Much more than we could eat.The following morning we were up early for the sunrise safari starting with coffee and a snack. Although many of the animals in the reserve are not in their natural habitat they seem to be thriving and wander freely over approx. 27 KM. the only exception may be the giraffe who has lost its companions recently and doesn't seem to do well due to the lack of trees.There is a separate centre for some cheetahs and a leopard who are rescued and seen more institutionalised. It was autumn / winter when we visited and early mornings and evenings are quite cold so warm clothes needed- cameras are a must!After the trip it's back for buffet breakfast and check out by 11am, but you can stay and use the facilities- outdoor pools, sun beds, bar etc for as long as you like. We stayed until mid afternoon and were lucky to be able to watch elephants and water buffalo from the poolside.In all a very enjoyable experience, well organised, very helpful polite staff and high standard of facilities. It's not Sabi Sabi or Kruger but you are pretty much guaranteed to see some wildlife so would highly reccommend if you want a taster or are short on time."

If you do go, this what you will see at this fake zoo: several leopards houses behind a chain link fence; two elephants; two rhinos; about five hippos; maybe a few zebras; one giraffe because his partner died and, I'm told they've been saying forever that they replace him; one bull; and about five lions, perhaps most exciting part of the Jeep tour because you ride into cage. You won't see or do much more. You will see miles of empty dry land, while the guy prays that you might spot something else for the benefit of his reputation.

At the same time, it is large enough and as the animals are in a more restricted area, you will have a better chance to see more of them during just one day.Me and my colleague were picked up from our hotel in Cape Town early in the morning and returned there at appr. 5 pm. (We were informed that the pick up time from the was 5:30 a.m., but the minibus arrived only after 6 a.m.) A breakfast and a 2,5/3 hour game drive on a lorry during the morning were very nice. We saw lots of different large animals - hippos, austriches, rhinos, antilopes, zebras, a giraffe, elephants, lions, buffalos... The driver/guide was friendly and had some interesting nice-to-know facts about all the animals we saw. However, the best part of the trip was the quadbike tour we had after the lunch. We were just my colleague, myself and the guide, and we were lucky to see some of the large animals much closer than during the morning ride. The quadbike was easy and really fun to drive, although I had absolutely no previous experience of it. A one day visit to Aquila is not a full scale African safari, but absolutely worth the one day trip from Cape Town!"

There aren't a huge amount of animals, and the enclosures aren't massive so it's guaranteed to see the animals which was what we needed with our children - we knew it wouldn't be like visiting a park in the Kruger...Food was great, plenty of it, and I thought to a pretty good standard (we had lamb in the evening which couldn't have been better) and we and our girls were well looked after (dinner is at 7, our children normally eat at 5-5.30ish, but they were given a snack box when we arrived back from the drive to keep them going) and there was water in the fridge in our room when we arrived there as well as a glass of champagne or sparkling grape juice whilst checking in. The restaurant manager was brilliant with our children too.The accommodation was fine, we had a luxury family chalet which was plenty big enough and did the job for 4 adults, 2 kids. I'd probably describe it as 'rustic luxury' - the furniture etc is slightly old fashioned and I don't think it would compare with a city luxury but it was clean and tidy and more than adequate for a night stay.Our only disappointment was that the beautiful pool isn't heated, so is absolutely freezing (we'd have been happy with 'refreshing'!) so it wasn't great for our little ones, we could only stay in it for a few minutes and it would have been fun to spend longer in it...."

Despite the impressive surroundings, the facilities were low-quality, there were coach loads of people and the food was awful. The staff serving in the reserve itself seemed disinterested; the standard of cleanliness in the chalet wasn't great and the outside paths and gardens were a shambles. However, the game drives were great and we saw lots of animals and the game rangers were very knowledgeable. If you go with very low expectations, you may end up being pleased but not vice versa. "

This is basically an area where the big five animals (very few numbers) are kept in captivity to be viewed by tourists. The staff members are great though, very informative and worth tipping! The buffet was a slight disappointment as all the foods are very normal. Remember to bring your swim wear as their pools are great for sun bathing. Make sure to bring durable wear and sufficient sun block as it a dusty, bumpy ride!"

In that short period the pride of lions who inhabit 400 sq hectare's of land have almost doubled in size. They look fat and unhealthly, rather disturbing a sight for those of us who know how lean and dangerous these animals should be.The overall experience for tourists is undoubtedly memorable, but the question around captive animals hits home when you see what has happened to them. Are they better off in a park being fed to death or dead from poachers?Food was hearty, but not 5 star."

We had a blast... it was an amazing experience and would certainly recommend this game reserve.We stayed in a lovely cottage where insect cream and repellent was provided in case was required, We went to sleep and woke up hearing the wildlife and the roar of the lions. The weather was very warm but cooled nicely by air conditioning in our property and a nice outdoor shower. Tea and coffee making facilities in the room, a fridge and a safe which was useful.A nice terrace outside the property where we sat and relaxed watching the Buffalos'We arrived by midday, easy to park the car up under shades and then were greeted with a welcome drink and made our way to the restaurant for lunch, plenty of choice and was fine.- Lunch was included in the overnight package but drinks extra - drinks are very cheap to purchase.At 2pm we were able to get our key for our property and then shortly after joined our afternoon game drive.Our driver was called Abrial and was amazing, he explained so much about the animals and the land, including flowers, trees, a real insight into how the animals behave and their natural instincts.- Very friendly and informative. We had a couple of hours on the Game drive and stopped for champagne, nibbles close to the rhinos, a great setting and the views in the park are fantastic.We saw Rhinos, Buffalo's, Zebra, Spring Bok, Hippos although as so warm they were dancing under water with their little legs and then popping up for photos... We also saw the Giraffe, Elephants and the lions which are in a separate enclosure but you can get up close.The leopard was in a separate area by the game reserve.Also crocodiles.Dinner was included at the restaurant and again plenty of choice.We sat outside of the restaurant and enjoyed the view by the pool and the horizon. Every where is very clean and staff are all friendly and helpful. A very relaxed feel whilst you are there We had fabulous sunshine too.The following morning we were up early for the morning game drive, we left around 630am and saw again the animals by the watering holes, we had the same driver meeting him and our group after coffee and rusks. Abrial was such a lovely guy.The game drive was an hour or so and great fun.We then returned and had a nice breakfast sat outside in the sunshine and then checked out later that morningWe had a truly brilliant time."

It was great to see the leopard and cheetah up close in the ARC. We woke up in the morning to see a buffalo metres from our door which was exciting.

This was well worth it, we had a long drive to the Aquila game reserve and arrived in time to enjoy a lovely lunch, it was a varied selection of hot and cold buffet food with desserts. We had a quick look around the small shop (I do think they could make more of this with drinks/snacks and more momento's of the game reserve) we were shown to a large open jeep with enough room for us all to have a 'window' seat. Our tour guide/driver was very knowledgeable, he introduced himself and told us a little about the game reserve, the animals we would hopefully see and that we would stop for drinks half way round. We were able to see Zebra's, Rhino's, Ostrich, Hippo's and elephant's amongst other animals we were able to get quite close up to see the animals and were told some information on each animal as we were able to stop near each 'area'. The mountain Lions were in a separate part of the reserve at the moment; our tour guide explained that it is because it is quite a new reserve - only a few years old and they are building up on the animals before the lions can mix with all of the animals.At the end of the tour we were taken around their conservation area where they have rescued ill or hurt animals. This was followed by a much needed swim in a lovely pool in beautiful surroundings. I would recommend this game reserve to anyone wanting to spend a few hours seeing the Big 5 of South Africa without having to part with hundreds of pounds.FYI: The trip cost us around \u00a385.00 each, it took us about 2hrs 15mins to drive there ourselves from Fish Hoek, lunch was 12:30 and we then waited outside to be collected at 1:30ish for a drive around until about 3:30pm."

The \"safari\" was not really a safari having been on a few--very few animals and caged in overweight lions, just two elephants, two water buffalo, a few lions, some zebra and some springbok. Within the first 5 minutes of leaving the hotel you saw 80 percent of the animals since it is all planned out that way. Really just an assembly line of jeeps. The last part of the tour you were out of sight of the hotel so it felt slightly more like a real safari. Meant for foreign day trippers who have never seen animals outside of a zoo and don't know any better. It could be MUCH better but obviously they don't feel that they need to improve the conditions of the animals because the place is PACKED with hordes of bus groups! It only gets nice and quiet at about 4pm when all the day people leave. So overall a disappointment but fine if you have little expectations."

Aquila Game Reserve near Touws River in the Western Cape may offer a good experience to day trippers but don't go there if you want exclusivity, pampering or even real luxury. We made use of a special offer in a magazine and booked one of the Premier Luxury Chalets for two days to celebrate Valentine's Day. The bedroom in the Premier Chalet is small - two chairs and a small table is chucked in a corner and not very inviting. The bathroom is quite spectacular and carved in the rock but that space could have been better used in the bedroom. The verandah does not have adequate shading and therefore cannot be used on a summer afternoon. One of the bed lamps's bulbs was not working and there is no desk which means that you have to sit on the bed to use the Wifi connection. There is no dressing table in the bedroom and you have to run between the hair dryer in the bedroom and the mirror in the bathroom to style your hair. The cupboard is very small and not sufficient for dresses. Don't expect gourmet food - everything is mass produced and the only way of eating is buffet style - morning, noon and night. The restaurant is unbearably hot and you have to specially request to sit outside. Our monring game drive was rushed with little information given but the afternoon drive was better and longer and guests were given dried fruit, nuts and biltong snacks as well as water and sparkling wine. No night chocolates or bed preparation though and don't expect clean laundry on the second day of your stay. We had to ask twice for replacement coffee and milk as well as tissues in the bathroom. We had to ask for a glass of sparkling wine on Valentine's night and was told it has run out but after complaining, the head waitress, a gem called Anastasia brought us two glasses of sparkling wine - and that was the resort's only Valentine touch. The overall impression is that this resort focusses on day trippers while overnight guests are neglected. Don't go if you have visited game lodges in the same price range in other parts of South Africa such as the Kruger Game Park in Mpumalanga, game lodges in Limpopo or Kwa-Zulu Natal because you will be disappointed. Overseas guests with limited time will enjoy the day trip though as they will be able to see the Big 5 (although the only leopard and lone cheetah are kept in a sanctuary). The staff are friendly though and liquor prices in the quite beautiful lounge are very reasonable."

Being the first pick-up on the minibus, it took 3 and a half hours each way to get here.On arrival, we were handed a glass of champagne or grape juice, and then into the restaurant for a gorgeous buffet breakfast.We then went to our jeep, which should have left at 10.15, but we didn't leave until 10.35, as we were waiting for other guests to arrive, which was a bit annoying.We drove around the park and the first part was the fenced off area where the cheetahs live. They didn't come out, so we just stared at the barbed wire for a few minutes until the ranger asked if we wanted to continue around the park. Luckily, this was the only caged area, as if I wanted to see animals locked up, I could have gone to the zoo!The next stop we saw some zebra, which was nice, and the ranger gave us some facts about them which was interesting. We then saw antelope, a rhino mum and her baby (awwwww!), elephants, buffalo, lions (they are fenced off from the other animals to stop them from eating them all) and ostriches. We also saw the hippos poking their noses up from the watering hole, but they didn't come out. The giraffes were elsewhere, and it was a shame not to see them.Annoyingly, we were then returned to the restaurant for an early lunch, as they had a large party arriving shortly - so not only were we late to leave, but also early to return! It would have been nice to have spend more time, and maybe spotted the elusive giraffes.Lunch was delicious - a hot buffet with a good choice. Drinks were extra. After lunch I lay by the pleasant swimming pool (bring your towel and swimsuit) and sunbathed until 3pm when it was time to get back on the bus to return to Cape Town.This trip cost \u00a3140, and I did it because I didn't want to come all the way to Africa and not see animals in their natural habitat. However, I'd have seen more animals if I'd gone to a zoo or safari park, albeit they wouldn't have been roaming free.The plus points were the food, the nice swimming pool, and seeing a few beautiful creatures up close and personal. The bad points was the extremely long drive, late start and early finish. Would I recommend it? For \u00a3140, no, I wouldn't come again."

We only stayed 1 night - so took the Standard Rooms. The Premier Luxury would be lovely if you are staying for longer than 1 night. The Standard rooms don't have a view but we woke to see Buffalo just outside our chalet. Our guide Daniel van Wyk was very knowledgeable. Some excitement for us was when the Buffalo rammed our truck. There arent a lot of game but because it is small you do get to see a lot in a short space of time. It is wonderful that Aquila help in rehabilitation of beautiful animals that have been abused by humans. The staff are friendly. Buffet at the restaurant served great food. We did find out last day very rushed because the game drive is about 2 - 3 hours long starting at 6:30am but you have to check out by 10 am, so we rushed through our breakfast which ends at 10 am as well. All in all, beautiful sunset, lovely pool area, great food, great game. A wonderful place for a getaway from Cape Town especially as it is only 2 hrs away and an easy drive."

Should you at least let you stay till 12pm. Also I found that the Quad bikes and horse back riding to expensive. R950.00 per person. Should have family discounts or packages.My daughter of 2 had a great time looking at the animals. Maybe could have sime tame animals for children to interact with. Otherwise what a great and beautiful place for a weekend or day getaway."

This is a very good fenced-in game park with separate enclosures for the lions and their would be dinner. You probably have seen the same animals in your own country in animal parks but there is nothing like seeing them in their own habitat. The lodge area is lovely and well worth doing the overnight stay if you can. Having a beer outside as the sun goes down behind the hills is amazing. The rooms are clean and ours had an outside shower which was fantastic. Breakfast was excellent but dinner and lunch not quite as good with tough meat. Shame they didn't do a BBQ in the fire pit outside. The tour trucks were very comfortable considering what they had to put up with and the guide / driver we had was excellent. If you do the overnight you get the evening safari and the early morning one. Definitely the best way to do it."

You cannot expect a Kruger National Park experience, but for a game reserve only two and a half hours from Cape Town, it is a great experience. The game drives were lovely and the guides were very knowledgeable. You get two game drives a day (as a resident guest), and even by the time we had our fourth one, we were not bored. We also did a horse riding safari, which was very nice, lovely well kept happy horses. The food was good, some thing for every one. The rooms were lovely, we stayed in two different types, both were well decorated, and I loved showering out doors, with the stars shining down. The young adults we were with did the quad biking and just loved it, Well worth the trip."

When we got the correct ones we found out we were 90km off. So we missed the morning day tour and managed by phone re-book ourselves to the afternoon day tour instead. When we finally arrived, we had to argue with them for an hour at least before they gave us back the difference because they sent us the wrong GPS coordinates and brought us to a wrong place. The price of Morning and Afternoon day tour are not the same. We saw just 2 elephants, 2 rhinos, springboks, zebras, ostriches and 1 hippo which was mostly under the dust water. Everyone in the truck (we were 24) could barely see the one lion and one tiger in a very far distant up in the rock. The guide told us the animals usually hide in the afternoon because of the heat. The people in the game reserve are doing a terrific job to preserve the wildlife and protect the animals.However, it was a bit expensive for what you get and certainly not worth the time if you drive all the way from Cape Town. Expect the drive time from Cape Town is around 3hours one way."

(Even for a vegetarian like myself who does not normally like buffets) the friend I was with had been there a couple times before and they noted their tour guides were excellent, so I guess this guy was atypical.

The reserve isn't under 2 hours from Cape Town, more like 3 hours.The lions are kept inside a fence inside the main reserve as we were told there are not enough other animals to support the lions hunting so the lions are separated and fed by the park rangers. There are just 2 elephants and 1 giraffe in the reserve, along with an unspecified number of rhino's (we saw 2) and zebra, springboks, ostriches etc. The crocodiles, and leopards are outside of the reserve across the road in the rehabilitation centre. The accommodation isn't luxury.... We were first put in a room with a tin roof until we showed the (very unhelpful) receptionist that we had booked different accommodation at which point she threw new keys at a ranger and told us to follow him.The booking process is difficult, at one point we had two bookings, then none, then the reserve tried to charge us more for the trip than the booking stated because 'the agent who made the booking had left the company' Overall it was expensive for what it is.Good points were the rangers, we had Tyler and he was excellent; very knowledgeable and clearly loved his job which made the game drives a pleasure"

We arrived to be greeted with a welcome refreshment and were checked into the resort. Earlier reviews are very fair, Aquila is a resort and a lovely one at that. The setting, facilities and food were excellent however the Big 5 Safari experience was a little disappointing. Having not seen the Big 5 together in one place this was an exciting trip for us. The safari trucks made for a comfortable journey out on to the reserve, however the guide was very inexperienced and lacked knowledge. By his own admission he had only been doing the job 4 a few months. We first saw the white rhino; 4 females. These are the only remaining Aquila rhino, as poachers have claimed the lives of the 2 males the resort previously owned. We were lucky 2 see these rhino as they are habitually very shy, however as other reviews accurately state this is not quite the authentic Big 5 experience you bargain on. The 2 male elephants were our next sighting and we watched them play in the mud at the watering hole. Again no sign of a heard, neither of any females! Not what you would expect in a natural habitat. The Buffalo once again were only 2 in number and the setting not as authentic as hoped. Whilst the Lion reviews are accurate and these magnificent animals are caged, their roaming area is large. We. enjoyed the lion interaction and the opportunity to get very close to these beautiful creatures. Again not at all authentic in real Big 5 terms, but enjoyable none the less. The Leopard was a beautiful creature but once again, previous reviews are 100% accurate. This animal is in captivity in the rescue centre, as it cannot be released back in to the wild as poachers have claimed her claws. This for us was a cheat on the Big 5 as the leopard was completely captive and will not be released. Aquila is a lovely resort and we really enjoyed our trip. More time and money has been spent on the resort and not the animals which is a shame. Big 5- not quite!"

So between the four of us we paid about \u00a3130 each, had we driven ourselves it would have been about \u00a375 per person. We were collected on the morning of the trip by a minibus and whilst I don't have problem with a minibus, it certainly wasn't worth over \u00a3200 for four of us to share with another 6 people. As for the safari, it was good and we did see the big 5 and we were able to get very close and I took some great picks. The ranger was very knowledgeable and made the trip around the park interesting. The welcome drink was nice as was the breakfast and lunch."

I visited this reserve in November '13, all the advertisement in Cape Town pointed to this Reserve to be the best, and closest to Cape Town, offering the Big 5. So being an animal lover I thought it would be great! I was disappointed and saddened at what it actually was. We turned up after a two hour drive to a gorgeous resort, but that was it, it was a resort. On commencing the drive needless to say I was giddy, but all that stopped when it actually dawned on me that this is pretty much a zoo. It is good for the ignorant, who thinks wherever you turn in Africa you are going to see a lion or elephant, but if you are an animal lover you will be disappointed!!It started with only seeing 2 of each animal, two wildebeest, two elephants and two water buffalo, all of which like to be in herds. Then on to the lions which I'm pretty sure aren't meant to be contained behind barbed wire and fencing and pretty certain a brick hut with a tin roof is not their natural habitat!! A part of the big 5 is the leopard, this was my sole reason for this trip, there was no sign of any leopard or any trees in which a leopard would hide, it was only when visiting the 'ARC' the Aquila rehabilitation and conservation area we saw a leopard in a cage on a tin roof. We were informed that it had been rescued and was due to be released, yet this was the only leopard they had, and they had advertised the big 5. They have no intention of releasing that leopard.I would definitely not visit this RESORT again instead I would pay a little extra and go to Addo Elephant Park or further more to Kruger, where they show interest in conservation!!Please DO NOT support this Reserve!!"

Good idea by Aquila to provide insect repelent. Pity there was no fire pit the night we were there as I was looking forward to the experience. Aquila is very involved with the Saving Private Rhino project, I would have liked to see more awareness around it, such as an exhibition or photographs, and have the Guide tell us about it, particularly as Aquila lost two rhinos to poaching."

We chose here as we did not fancy a long distance to a game reserve further north. We felt it would be similar to doing Euro Disney first before Disney Florida. This proved to be right an ideal taster for the bigger game reserves such as Kruger etc. it was a great experience though as in our first four days in South Africa the most we had seen was a Grey Squirrel! Would recommend just an overnight stay and two drives. The welcome, food and service was good with the best swimming pool which we did not use! The drive to see the animals were excellent with Michael our driver providing a good tour. We got very close to the animals with great pictures. Main disappointment due to the habitat no trees was only two elephants and one very lonely giraffe. The drive and other animals were a good compensation especially the bubbles stop in the middle of the park with the hippo's, rhino and zebra. The accommodation was good as well, clean and tidy, large bed and outside shower. We were in an end cottage near the park gate so lovely to wake up with the animals so close. You could go on horses and quad bikes but we preferred the lorries which were comfortable enough and plenty of space and views to take pictures. Overall cost for the overnight stay with all food included was around \u00a3260 so fantastic value with the current rand situation."

Stayed overnight and had 2 \"safaris\" one afternoon and one early morning. Our guide on these was excellent. Great opportunity to see Lions, Rhinos, Elephants, Hippos and many other animals in a \"natural\" environment. Room was great (mezzanine so good for a family with teenagers). The main centre of Aquila is nicely laid out with a large restaurant, separate indoor bar and long pool with \"swim up\" outside bar. Pool towels are available free of charge to borrow. The negatives were the overall welcome and food. The reception staff, unlike the safari guides came across as sullen and lacking in interest. They could do with some training in how to welcome guests as individuals and not treat you with disinterest. The food was also disappointing. All meals are buffet style. This is OK for lunch (very busy due to day visitors) and breakfast. But for the evening meal when numbers are lower (no day trippers then) it was poor. The food is basic catering and could have been so much better. A proper restaurant service evening meal would really improve the experience here. Overall therefore - good - as the experience of the safari is excellent. But be prepared for overall poor service, especially at reception, and don't expect anything much better than school style catering."

I am convinced these animals are all fed as opposed to being in 'natural' surroundings and hunting for their survival... DISGUSTED!"

We were not based in Cape Town so did not benefit from the transport included in the price.However the drive was was through scenic countryside and a pleasure . We arrived too early for the welcoming drink but were able to do breakfast from 8 am. There was a fair selection of food, though the hot foods were lukewarm. Our game drive at 10.15am was efficiently organised and left promptly. there were about 15- 20 people in our viewing vehicle which needed a bit of maintenance. Jannie , our guide and driver was friendly and relatively knowledgeable. We saw buffalo and rhino in the first camp which all looked in reasonable condition and unstressed. If anything a bit on the fat side, It would have been better to make the drive a bit longer before seeing the animals,as the reserve was large.Taking pictures with pantechnikons in the background calls for skillful cropping. Then into the lion's den, again the feeding point was right at the entrance gate, but we saw a big lioness dragging a leg of something off to a shady place and two big black maned Cape Mountain lions. There giraffe and other animals like springbok, eland, zebra and buffalo. The elephants were great as they wandered close to the lodge and clearly enjoyed a mud bath in full view. Again a good selection of dishes for the self service lunch, Staff were friendly and coped well with the large cross section of tourists. Pros - you will see the animals, Cons - too many people"

Our guide Daniel for the 2 safaris was outstanding...the most informative guide, friendly and answered every question asked. I would say to anyone who wants to see African wildlife up close, to make the visit but don't expect first class food! "

We got to see all of The big 5, if we include the leopard at the rescue centre. The lodge was luxurious with african interior!

They're doing good work to help protect various species and allow people the chance to get close to them and learn about them. I only went on the day safari but the facilities were excellent and the food was wonderful. The game drive itself was great, with a knowledgeable guide who did his best to give everyone a good view of as many animals as possible.It's somewhere between a very large safari park and a traditional safari, but if you're short on time or want to get up close to animals in a good environment without having to head out in to the wilderness and all the expense that involves, then Aquila is a good choice."

We arrived to an amazing thunderstorm, complete with forked lightening! The greeting was warm and friendly, and the first impressions were excellent. What better way to be greeted after a two hour transfer than with ice cold bubbles?! We had lunch before we checked in and everything was delicious and very fresh. There was a great selection, no matter your tastes. We then checked into our room and I was very impressed! We were staying in the honeymoon suite with an outdoor jacuzzi- perfect for a glass of wine, weather permitting! The room was very comfortable, with a large double bed and beautiful bathroom, complete with sunken bath. We were then taken out of the first of our safaris and were lucky enough to see the Big Five. The guide was very knowledgeable and friendly and spent time answering many questions. Our dinner that evening was again of a very good standard, and the service was excellent. The next morning we were up early for another safari, which was again great, other than a run in with a rhino who is clearly not a 'morning person'! The most special part of the trip however was the horseback safari. It was incredible to get up close with the animals, and we were lucky enough to get very close to a very friendly giraffe. Our guide for the horses was very friendly, and very funny and it was an amazing two hours. We also did the quad bike safari- not so great for seeing the animals but great for a bit of an adrenaline rush and blowing away the cobwebs! All in all, the stay was brilliant. The staff were excellent, the food great and the accomodation very special. We even came back to our room at night to find an elephant inside (albeit one made from a towel!). It is worth bearing in mind that this is a private game reserve and not a National Park, so they are limited in the number of animals that they have, but I would wholeheartedly recommend it as a very special place to see some beautiful animals in wonderful surroundings. Thank you Aquila. Suzi x"

The reserve has some wonderful animals and scenery and should take about 2 to 3 hours. It is malaria free and is an easy 2 hour drive from Cape Town, 1.5 hours if staying in Stellnbosch. We found the food for breakfast and lunch to be good and the service was very friendly.They also have a small pony ride for the kiddos and you can do a horse back or quad safari if you book ahead.I would recommend for young families and those that don't have the time to get to Krueger or the Eastern Cape.They guide was very knowledgeable and friendly.

I know you want to make sure that they are there to be seen by your guests, but they are unhealthy fat and lazy. If they can walk that hill a few times to get to their food, it will surely help them, because they will need to come down for water.6. Bungalow 21 had a lot of mice. I at least counted 3 which I could see at the same time, but there was quite a lot. They will attrack snakes which can be very dangerous to your guests.7. You need to plant more trees. Everybody knows that elephants are very big destroyers of trees. But they need tree bark as part of their diet and you need to get new trees planted. Most of the eucalyptus trees are dying and there are nothing else to replace them. Obviously you will need to protect the new trees against the elephants while it is very young, but you need more trees!!!"

The tour guide was brilliant had lots of time for questions and was very knowledgeable. Also had a lot of fun on the quad bikes but was perfectly safe all the way throughout the trip.

We really enjoyed our time at Aquila, arriving in the afternoon, just in time for lunch, we then were able to relax around the pool with the Karoo as the backdrop. Then we had our first game drive. Although all these animals once did roam this area, because of lack of habitat, they are all imported, so if you wanted 'Real Safari,' you may have to try somewhere like the Kruger National Park but for us this was more than adequate and excellent value for money. All the 'Big Five' are there though the lions are kept separately to stop them eating the rest of the stock and the leopard is unfortunately of the rescue variety and she cannot be let loose because somebody removed her claws.We were brought back for dinner which was not quite up to the standard of the rest of the place but the accommodation was really good and had an open shower where you could look at the sun or the stars, depending on the time of day.We went out first thing and once again saw the giraffe, wildebeests, zebras, rhinos, ostriches,hippos and a very close encounter with the Cape buffalo but our luck seemed to be out with the elephants. As we were returning for breakfast, one of our party caught a glimpse of them and our excellent guide spent an extra 45 minutes taking us around them so we could have a great view without spooking them.We could easily have stayed for a second night. Marvellous place."

The scenery is mountains with open prairie in between that is similar to sagebrush areas of the American west. We stayed two nights in a comfortable cabin and did 3 game drives. We were glad we did three as each time the lighting was different for photos and the animals doing different things. This is not an extremely wild/exotic place but fun for all ages. You travel bumpy roads in big safari jeeps. The eye-catching lodge serves super food buffet style while outside is a beautiful pool and lounge area. I would imagine that this area will get VERY hot in summer (Dec-Feb) so be aware when you book your trip. There was limited WIFI in our cabin but better in the lodge. The area is also malaria-free, a big plus. If you are in the SW Cape area of South Africa and have never done a safari this is the place for you."

Although this does not have the natural feel of a large game park, it is a very good introduction to seeing animals in the wild. I like the fact that it has rescued some of the big cat's from a cruel fate, which makes up for the fact that they were all fenced off. Helping the economy of the local town by only employing from there is also to be admired. Only minor gripes are that the food was not of the standard I would have expected, and on the game drive, no mention was made of any birds, and some animals were also missed, or ignored.

            "review": "Spontanious Dismount. As I prepare for another trip to Capetown I realized that I didn't get a response to a letter I had written to Aquila regarding our stay in February 2013. As a side trip to our trip to SA for the Indaba Mining Convention we extended our trip to include a luxurious night in one of the chalets, which we found to be really charming and were quite excited to have this Safari experience. Upon arrival we were a little disappointed that we were made to wait by the pool before we could check into our room, and was even more disappointed when there wasn't even a bar open. However after lunch we were escorted to our room and then proceeded to a guided jeep tour of the Big 5. Our guide was very informative and gave us a great deal of insight into the poaching situation all over Africa. We then returned to our room and had a fabulous meal, with many wonderful flavours. I do have to say however the kitchen staff were much more friendlier than the serving staff.  The following day we were booked on a horseback tour, and when we had arrived to the site there was a bit of a mix up and our horses were given to another couple, and the guides had to go back to the corral and bring out more horses. Not a problem but they were super frisky and trotted out on their back legs. We mounted and the horses didn't want to go in the \"safari compound\" ( should have listened to them) anyway we did have a lovely ride until the elephant decided to chase us. We got bucked off and our horses ran away. In retrospect, with the weather changing and the animals agitated the ride probably should have been called off. My husband was hurt and here was the problem. I asked for medical attention for him and we were told to wait as they were dealing with an angry customer, who by the way was at the desk the night before about the same issue. I then asked for someplace for us to get cleaned up and look at his leg and were told a bathroom down the hall would be available. I insisted we have a room, and asked for ice at least. By this time he was shocky. I got him cleaned up and he was able to hobble back to the reception area, and our driver was trying to get the manager to at least speak with us as he did require medical attention and she told him we would have to wait until she had finished dealing with angry man about his transportation problem. So long and short, we headed back to Capetown for some care.  Lovely facility, great kitchen staff, but as for the horseback tour I would strongly recommend going by jeep. The horses were ill trained, and I felt the guide was not prepared for that situation. It could have been worse. And did I mention I am a trained equestrian, bucking horses are an occurance in my job.  Considering the amount of money we paid for the premium service, Im afraid it fell very short of that. But it was a nice place to visit."

Ok so, to say I saw the Big 5, albeit true, is not true in the safari sense...let me explain...Firstly, I have to point out that this was the second game drive in the space of 2 weeks (the first at an alternative Nature Reserve further up the coast) so by that time I had come to accept the fact that sometimes, you just don't see all of the animals...at the first Reserve the guide explained that you hardly ever see leopards, they hide/camouflage...it's just what they do.We got to see tons of animals on our drive...including Hippo's and Rhino's (1/5)...so excited!!! (I hadn't seen them before). Since they do not have sufficient prey for the Lions (2/5), they are kept separately. I'm still on the fence as to how I feel about that, but at least you get to see the lions, at my first Safari we couldn't find the lions any ware...and we drove for hours. Unlike a previous comment, the lions actually weren't that lazy, they came down from a hill while we were there and started playing with one another, I guess it didn't hurt that it was mating season!So after seeing the elephant's (3/5) zebra's, their one giraffe (2 others died in a climbing accident), a few rather large buffalo (4/5) and countless deer, I was once again left hoping for a Leopard.I had altogether given up on it when they completed the drive, but then, we didn\u2019t go back to the lodge.Aquila has a rehabilitation area, where they keep animals that are recovering, they has a couple of lions, cheetahs...and a LEOPARD!!!! Score!! 5/5I didn't the service at the Lodge, the guide was obviously my favourite, as the drive was the highlight of the stay, but the staff were friendly...either that or I was enjoying myself with my family too much to complain.The only thing that I would note and that was a bit of a letdown was the Food Temperature. All 3 meals we had there were cold, though the range was lovely and the staff happily warmed the food when requested.I would happily take tourists back; my only hope is that they incorporate more animals into the park as at times it did seem a little sparse."

When did you last stroke a wild Cheetah. Aquilla is Not Kruger or Hwange. But it does provide an unforgetable trip. Guides and staff were great too. the quad bilkes and horse safaris looked fun."

We felt the few Game were not in their natural habitats and the whole experience was geared towards tourists who wanted to see game. The only giraffe we saw in your reserve looked lonely and miserable especially since he was having to eat his food off the ground as there were no trees around, natural for them. Too expensive for what we experienced!"

The Game Drives were exciting, including the breakdown of the Truck( Thank Goodness it was not in the Lion Enclosure, but the problem was soon sorted and it was part of our adventure.The Guide was well informed, the scenery stunning and the Animals were great to see, the Big 5 and More.

We were taken to our room after lunch and everything was explained. The only thing I could complain about is the bedding which was on the old side but that could be overseen.

We arrived at 12.30 and were welcomed and went stgraight to lunch as the room is only allocated at 2pm. We had a permiere room overlooking the reserve and it was very comfortable although the outdoor shower was a bit cold this time of year, even with a hot tap. It must be really nice in the summer. There is also a big bath. The room also had a fridge and a fireplace which was nice and the wood was stacked at the door. At 4pm we went on a \"game drive\" and we did see animals up close and personal. they do have a load of restriction on the number of animals they are allowed on the reserve so you have to understand their predicament. We saw hippos,elephant, zebra, buck of various kinds, rhino (spectacular), giraffe in the main reserve and the in the separate reserve lions who looked very lazy. At the end of the drive we went past the hippos again and they suddenly became active and put on a quick show. The guide we had (Daniel), was very good and knowledegable about the animals and the reserve. This type of place is for people who can't get to the real parks though. It has 2 swimming pools and a lounge bar for times when not out in the bush. You can also do a game drive on a quad bike or horse. It is quite expensive for what it is although it must cost a huge amount to run. They do offer specials in the off season. The food is OK, nothing great or special."

Since unfortunately we had to cancel our planned trip to the Kruger park, my daughter still insisted that she wanted to see the BIG 5 for her 13th birthday. Hearing a teenager say she wants to be out in nature with the family rather than shopping in mall is like having your tummy sprinkled with fairy dust .. ALL GOOD!So, the hunt began and 15 mins later we opted for Aquila based on our budget, travel time and amenities for the Mrs' wheelchair. Initially we had some trouble with the online/email booking process with responses from staff taking longer than what felt comfortable. I raised my email voice a bit and after receiving a phonecall, the booking was sorted out within a few mins. Only downside was that the family suite I wanted was no longer available - I really wanted to chill in the jacuzzi :(Anyways, bags packed and off we did trot to the land of Karoo bossies. Arrived early, but the team was friendly and showed us to the lounge area for a fire and some drinks. The weather was a bit chilly this late in September.Lunch was buffet and once we got into the smaller-than-expected-but-well-equipped room, and the food settled a bit we clambered aboard the viewing truck and set off into the wilderness. Our guide proving interesting and funny little anecdotes about the animals and the reserve. The 3 hours spent in the chilly September afternoon air (for which we were a little ill prepared for) rushed past and after hearing the final lion roar we headed back to base for a much deserved buffet dinner. Yep, we're eating again!Up early morning for a quick cup o' java, onto the truck for the morning drive. This time were a little better prepared with warmer jackets and multiple layers of clothing!Once again our guide made sure that we have enough time to take a multitude of photos. (note to self .. I'm so gonna make a powerpoint slide for the neighbours!) Also, where we had limited viewing time the day before, we were allowed to spend some extra time to oooh-and-aaah at mother nature's handiwork.Final stop was the ARC where spotted some Cheetah and a Leopard (see what I did there?) before heading back for breakfast. Yes. Feeding time for the tourist.Last trip to the rooms to pack our bags, pay the final drinks bill, clamber back into the car and take a leisurely trip back to the world beyond the mountains.All in all a good experience. A birthday wish granted and my photo count upped by a few 100!"

Loved the horse-back safari with our knowledgeable guide, and this was the highlight of our stay, especially as we saw zebra, elephants and hippos at close range. On our game drive however, we didn't really like the fact that we were led to believe we 'might' see the lions, as they are 'difficult to find'... only to be driven into a very small enclosure where 7 beautiful but bored-looking lions were languishing beside a little watering hole, almost like actors in a safari-themed play! They are gorgeous but it made us sad that they're in such a small enclosure, and that there's nothing safari-like about 'tracking down' a pride of lions kept in captivity. Our room was comfy and despite how cold it was, the blankets were thick and warm. Liked the outdoor shower - very unique - and the lovely big bath! The food was good, but nothing special - buffets for lunch and dinner, and we actually skipped breakfast as we didn't think we could expect anything more exciting than... another buffet. The bar fridge in our room hadn't been cleaned and there was a container of milk going sour inside, which meant that the bottles of water we were given (left inside the fridge for us) smelt of sour milk, which was quite off-putting.In all, we'd go again, but only if we got a really good special deal. It's not going to blow you away, but it is fun, enjoyable, accessible and a nice break from the regular."

This place has so much more potential.I was staying with friends in Cape Town and wanted to get to see some of the game without going too far out of town.Aquila is worth visiting but not staying at overnight. You arrive to a very limp welcome drink having had to be ready at a very early hour in the morning for pickup - it takes 2.5 hours in a ropey minibus to get there. You then have a buffet breakfast on a 3 star level and have to wait until 4pm before you go on your game drive - this is very frustrating as there is little to do at the resort, particularly if you are on your own as I was and paying a supplement for that privilege too! Lunch is another 3 star buffet.The afternoon game drive was lovely. But it is really no more than a very big safari park. It is a vey bumpy ride, so be prepared. I saw the animals I was expecting to see.Then dinner - you guessed it - another 3 star buffet.There is a lovely bar/lounge with open fires, but was deserted when I had a very reasonable glass of wine.The chalets are fine and the bed was large and comfortable.Upe early for the morning drive - not many animals about, but the scenery was bathed in morning light and we watched the lions descend from the rocky hills to their enclosure.The bus was late to take us back and the driver more interested in his mobile than safe travel in pouring rain.So, do if you are close by do a day visit, but be aware that you will not have much to do whilst waiting to see the animals.The staff were pleasant, but not very interested in guests or creating any kind of atmosphere."

Had lots of laughs and throughly enjoyed it. We appreciated it that the young people with their children all went in one game truck. Us oldies love our grandchildren but not ona constant basis. We would love to come again inthe future. If i only have one negative to state it would be the state of the roads. They really shake you up, in spite of the drivers care you occasionally get shaken right out of you seat!"

We were met straight from our car with a hot towel to refresh ourselves and was shown to the welcome drinks bar. We were a little early to be able to check in but we had the lounge bar to ourselves, and with a roaring fire and our books we were happy. At check in time, we were shown to our lodge by one of the rangers, we did have to call another one back as the fire wouldn't light in our room. Timothy came back with some fire-lighters and we soon had a good fire going. He was also our safari guide, and I can honestly say we could not have asked for a better guide. We saw everything, we had a little boy on our trip who asked very intelligent questions, and we all enjoyed him asking the questions and Timothy answering them :-)The food was a hot buffet, and there was plenty of it at all sittings, and delicious food it was too!I would highly recommend this game reserve to everyone, and hopefully you will get Timothy as a guide! It was very thought-provoking, informative, interesting trip."

OK if you only have one day and want to see big 5 at all costs. If you have visited proper wildlife reserves or parks in Africa this one will definitely disappoint. Carnivores all seperately caged in small compounds to stop them eating the other animals, herbivores grouped together and fed with bales of straw. Only two worse for weae elephants. Give it a miss."

I could go on and on. What a lovely experience and totally unexpected. We felt spoilt and so well cared for. We had no fixed plans on our holiday to Cape Town and were not even sure of where game reserves were located or if they could be booked at short notice.

We were greeted with a glass of champagne, then we got in to our jeeps and drove into the game reserve. We immediately saw buffaloes and springbok, then we saw hippopotamus, white rhinoceros, ostrich, zebra, giraffe, elephants and finally lions. It was amazing. We were able to edge our way closer and closer to the animals and we have got some wonderful photos. During another champagne break, the elephants walked even closer towards us, it was great. We had a lovely lunch. The restaurant was stunning, with high beams and beautiful views. You can stay there on a safari holiday. We're not sure exactly how much a holiday would cost. It's certainly a place I would recommend. After we had eaten, we went and saw a leopard and a cheetah. They had been rescued, and were in isolation, until they can fend for themselves again in the wild."

This is a game reserve and a great place for those who've never been on a safari before. All the animals are in a large enclosed area so you are sure to see all the animals. We did the overnight stay which included lunch, dinner, overnight accommodation, breakfast and two game drives which was excellent value for money. The accommodation and facilities are superb and all tastefully decorated. Our guide Daniel was excellent and showed a true passion caring for these wild animals and I felt he went above and beyond his normal duties. If you want to see wild animals hunting i.e. Lions hunting Springbok this is not the place for you. The Lions are kept separately as this is as I mentioned a game reserve and not the large national parks you see on TV. It's a great first time taster."

However if you are a tourist to SA and only have a day to see game, it is a great option.We stayed overnight so we had a bit more time to look around. The welcome is great with hot towels and sparkling wine. The main reception area and main lounge are great and accommodating. We had lunch, dinner and breakfast in the dining room. The welcome and service is great. The food is buffet style and ranges from great to average as these things tend to be. However a common problem was that most of the 'hot' food is cold apart from one or two dishes that are on stove tops. But as the plates are cold, the whole meal is cold by the time you get back to your table. Not a problem if you only eat salads though :)The game drives were well organized and you were taken right up to the game. The lions are still in a separate enclosure which means there is no chance of seeing a kill. They will be released once the buck population has increased. We got blankets, but no hot water bottles. The sherry and snacks were welcome though.The accommodation is good, but looking a bit tired these days. The main light was tripping the power supply and the wiring of the plugs very amateurish. The response of the maintenance crew was good. Although they could not fix the problem, they gave us a workaround.I do not think I would like to stay more than one night, but it was a great mid-winter outing and ideal for day-trippers from Cape Town."

The other animals roam freely and I would have no problem if this is what you are sold but it isnt.The animals consist of 2 Elephant, 1 Giraffe and 2 Male Buffalo's, lots of other roaming grazing species but the distance from Cape Town and the money is not value and a waste of your holiday time.You will see Cheetahs (caged) Lions (caged) Leopard (caged) although to be fair the guide did state that 2 Leopards are free but are rarely spotted. I would doubt that. If you want to see free roaming zebras, beest, hippo etc in a very small reserve then go for it but it was not for me."

My husband and I were in Cape Town, South Africa for our honeymoon and of course we wanted to experience an \"African Safari.\" Knowing Krueger was too far for this vacation we settled on Aquila as a day trip destination. The reviews we read were mixed and while this is no means comparable to Krueger, it was still an unforgettable experience. Being up close to all of those animals is not something you can easily do in the US! We did not see all of the animals, no hippos for example. The animals were clearly used to the vehicles and people, most hardly moved at the sight of us. When we started our journey it looked like they were herding the elephants in so we could get to see them. It was still a wonderful experience though! We were greeted with a welcome drink and breakfast. Easy check-in and friendly staff. A lunch followed our tour as well. The food was average. There were two vehicles that went out the morning we were there. Try to get in the first seat - best views in my opinion! Our tour guide was also extremely knowledgeable and made our experience even better. We stopped off for some water and wine with incredible views and picture moments near the zebras. This is truly a memorable experience and I highly recommend this to anyone that would like to experience a safari near Cape Town; it was the perfect day trip!"

I had reservations regarding the bitter cold and wind, but warmed quickly to the cold when they issued all passengers with warm blankets and hot water bottles!The game drive was the best. We saw all of the BIG 5 except the leopard. Other than the lions we got within touching distance of them all. We took the most beautiful photos! After a visit to the lions we stopped for drinks and snacks before heading back. Had a good smile when a cranky buffalo chased after us near the gate :-). Overall it was a five star visit.

This because of the fact that a saw a lot of fences, the animals were kept seperated and not together and in Aquila is that different. The animals are walking together in one place, just like in the real nature. That was really nice. Plus I saw the whole big five in Aquila and I had a safari with a snack, wine and beer during the safari. So yeah it was great!Thank you"

When we arrive we were welcomed by drive and then we went for a breakfast which was great, after that we started the safari and the tour guide was good as he knows what he was doing. We saw the big five as everyone when they went on the safari they would like to see the big five. The is one thing that you someone should know is that there are not much animals around the place but it is good to do it. We would recommend Aquila to the guest that would like to do the safari which is two hour drive from Cape Town."

Besides, how do you promote the concept of sustainable development with invasive vegetation being allowed to grow on the property? Protruding cement slabs and objects appear in the driveways, with very poor lighting at night creating a major risk of damage to your vehicle or hazard for injury. Worst lodge ever visited."

Our chatty guide, Daniel, was well trained to take care of us for about two and a half hours. Naming the animals by their various names including latin and finding the longest most winding route to somehow fill the time. In the end we did get to see the two resident elephants, two resident rhinos, one stunted giraffe, a couple of ostriches, fenced in predators, a couple of zebra's, hippo's in a pond and some other assorted \"wildlife\" one generally associates with Africa. Alas, if we would have had the time we would have prefered a real safari."

HiI found Aquila to be a nice tourist destination for tourists in SA who don't have the time to make it to game reserves such as Kruger etc. Unfortunately being an avid game viewer it lacked some of the excitement of these bigger game reserves and I hope that it can grow in size over time (the one ranger said that this was in the plans in the furute).Unfortunately the weather did not play its part when we were there but we still managed to have an enjoyable time in the lounge area by the fireplaces. It is a pity as it is really set up for being outside but bad weather is expected in Cape Town over winter.All in all a good trip!"

The private bungalow we reserved was incredible (we could see RHINOS from our balcony!!!) and the staff was awesome. The two safari rides were a great way for me to experience African animals, and the safaris were made even greater by our tour guide, Andrew. For one night and two safaris, it was awesome. Don't be mistaken, there are only a handful of the Big 5... There was a family also from the US that were there for several days, experiencing the same thing day after day and they seemed bored, but for 2 days, 1 night, it was PERFECT."

A delicious breakfast, which had something for even the fussiest of eaters, filled the grumbly tummys and then for our game drive.Welcome aboard the landy, with blankets and hot waterbottles provided to keep us toasty. The guide was knowledgable and determined to find as much game as possible, even though they were hiding from the cold wind. We saw and photographed most of the animals including the most adorable baby hippo, giraffe, rhinos, elephants and many buck. The lions were too clever for us and kept their hiding place a complete secret.After a wonderful, exciting drive, lunch. Mmmmm, again a spread to feed any taste. All supurbly presented, with the service to compliment. The pool looked very inviting, but rather chilly, so we decided to go to the lounge, sit at the fire, a glass of wine and family chats.Then it was time to leave.

It was awesome to see the animals in their \"semi\" natural habit roaming freely. None of the animals came near us. I was able to take great pictures. Not all of the animals were roaming- the leopard had its own large \"caged\" area and I was not able to take a picture of it. The lions were also separated from the other animals, so they would not eat them. But overall, the experience was far better than going to a zoo. The price of the safari included all meals (lunch, dinner and breakfast buffet and the food was delicious. Just be mindful the birds came in a sat on the containers and some areas of the buffet), the safari, and lodging. The rooms were tidy and felt like cabins. There were showers outside and inside the residences. It is a must see and a must do while in South Africa."

We had the same guide for both drives, and he was very informative and had a great sense of humour. He made sure that everyone on the truck had great photo opportunities and nobody was left out. We were even served champagne on the first game drive as the sun set. A great experience.We spent the night in the basic accommodation. The room was actually totally adequate (even had a stunning outdoor shower!). The only problem is the food - buffet for all 3 meals. The reason is that the food is supposed to be served hot but it is luke-warm at best. Bring your wallet - I was unaware that we would have to pay for all drinks (except coffee with breakfast), so I wish this had been communicated upfront. One can understand paying additional for alcohol, but not for soft drinks, water and tea/coffee.All-in-all this was a great experience and I would not hesitate to go again (but please sort out that buffet!)"

The day started early with a 2-hour drive from Cape Town on a rainy autumn morning.The reserve is easy to find and we presented ourselves at reception. Included in the package is a scrumptious buffet breakfast, after which we mustered for the game drive. We were surrounded by retired tourists from around the world, swaddled in their complimentary rain ponchos. We donned ours too and settled in. For the first hour or so it actually rained on us, as the vehicle is open-sided. But the rain ponchos protected our clothing. I had to hang on for dear life as the ride was very bumpy. For a moment I thought I might get motion sick!We saw all the animals and to my mind they were very tame. Elephant, rhino, hippo, zebra, giraffe, buffalo, wildebeest, eland, springbok. Plus some crocodiles, cheetahs and a shy leopard at the rescue enclosures. Having been to Etosha, the Kruger and the Addo, where you drive around for hours and if you\u2019re lucky get to see some animals, I could immediately tell this was a whole different setup. Rather more like a large, free-roaming zoo. But enjoyable nonetheless, as you get much closer to the animals and still see their natural behaviour. After the 3-hour game viewing we were deposited back at the dining hall and treated to a good buffet lunch. After a stroll around the grounds to take a few photographs, we headed back home.Amazing to see these majestic animals up close."

After 6 days in Cape Town we all agreed that our day spent at Aquila was our best.It was a few hours from the centre of Cape Town so we weren't expecting a large game reserve but it exceeded our expectations! We were greeted by friendly staff with a champagne reception and then had a breakfast buffet that had a lot of variety and there was something for us all. We then headed off on our game drive with a very friendly and knowledgable ranger. We immediately saw 2 elephants who we were able to get very close to, a lot closer than at a zoo as some of the others reviews have said. And after this saw many other animals; rhinos, lions, springbok, buffalo, wilder beast, zebras, ostrich. And the most of these animals we were able to get extremely close to. Including the cheetahs,leopard, lions and crocodiles in the rescue centre. Despite being in enclosed spaces, all the animals were there for their own safety and well being.Many complaints say that the enclosed area of the game reserve makes it more like a zoo than a safari. However, I feel as though the animals still have plenty of natural roaming room and wild land and if it was a non enclosed area, you have much less chance of seeing any animals at all! During our game drive we were pleasantly surprised when we were able to get out of the car and be closer to the animals as well as having the chance to have another glass of champagne!The lunch buffet was just as great as breakfast had been and we were all able to have as much of the varied food as we wanted! All in all, we all thoroughly enjoyed our day and it was a great place to visit! Would definitely recommend and go again."

This is not realy a safari at all. \u0130t's a trip through an open zoo. There are 2 elephants, 4 rhinos and one giraffe. The lions are separated from the other animals by fences. Also the crocodiles, leopards and cheetahs are kept behind fences. There are no buffaloes or hippos. Too expensive for what they offer. The organisation however was good. We went with a small group and with a good, nice minibus. Upon arrival we were offered champagne and a very nice breakfast. After the safari there was a very nice open buffet."

I think they are over doing it when they advertise it as a big 5 safari but at the end of the day you still get to see the animals in a better environment then a cage. We stayed overnight, the rooms were very nice and the pool was lovely. The food was good and our guide was experienced so even though it pretty much consisted of a drive through a giant enclosure to see the animals, and a smaller one to see the lions, he told us heaps of interesting stuff. Some staff were not the friendliest, we got a particularly dirty look because we dared suggest that they should play some happier african music rather than Christmas carols. So yes it's pretty much a big zoo and its pretty pricey but you would have to go quite a bit further north to be able to see all those animals. And even in the Kruger there is no guarantee you will, at least this way you get to see animals living in a natural environment. Just don't expect to be chased by lions or witness a cheetah bringing down a springbok, it is what it is..."

Had the feel of being in a cabin, but with luxury linens and conveniences. Loved the lodge at sop here. The staff were very accommodating to special requests wnd minor issues, especially the guest relations manager Linette who went out her way to ensure we had an exceptional stay for a special birthday celebration. When our horse safari was shortened because of rain, we were surprised a private one was offered then scheduled for us the next morning before our departure. When I say the staff went above and beyond with South Africa hospitality, I say it with honesty and gratitude for a memorable stay. Well worth the trip. Not a wild safari, but satisfies the curiosity and yearning to see the big 5!"

If you're in the market for a safari during your stay in the Western Cape, you'll probably be dissapointed too - you'll see as many animals (probably more) at places like Whipsnade, Longleat, Busch Gardens etc - this is by no stretch of the imagintion a safari as it claims.First the good.The actual resort isn't bad - nice restaurant building, bar / lounge area, pool etc. Breakfast buffet not bad either.The bad.The accomodation - dirty / dusty with nasty sewage smells.The \"safari\" and game drive. driving around a boring landscape with a few animals dotted about. When I did a real safari at the Selous game reserve, they gad to clear the runway of deer, giraffe & zebras before we could land! Here, there were 2 elephants, 4 rhino, (2 rhino had been shot by poachers.. what type of reserve is this if it doesn't protect its animals???) 1 giraffe (no trees in the park, so adult giraffe have to be taken away as they can't feed from the ground). Most sad (in africa of all places) was the lions in an elecrified pen looking bored, over fed and not living as they should in the wild. The rehabilitation centre was really depressing - all electrified pens - a lone leopard in one, 3 lions in another and 2 cheetah in a third. This is NOT a safari where you see these animals in their native environment. the only positive aspect was because the animals are used to people, they don't run off whe you approach, as they would in the wild.The Ugly.The food - absolutely dire (apart from breakfast) The same stuff was served up for dinner and lunch. Boring selection of tasteless muck. I could really relate to the people I watched circling the buffet over and over hoping something appetising might have appeared since the last tour.The restaurant, despite being nicely fitted out, is like eating in an aviary - with lots of birds flying in and around the tables. If you manage to find a seat without bird mess on it, should you leave your table for any reason, birds would swoop down onto the tables and eat the food! There were also mice running around the tables, hiding under the central stands of the tables.The lazy, disinterested staff made no attempt to remove the birds or stop the birds eating peoples food. I fact, the only time I saw any sign of life from the staff was when I left my table to get some coffee whereupon I was chased after as they thought I was leaving without paying for a bottle of water I ordered (Water is more expensive than beer in this place.... bring your own!)To summarize, If a safari is on your backet list - this should not be it. Go to one of the proper reserves like Selous, Serengeti, Kruger etc etc and see the real thing in all its magnificence and you'll be amazed by the variety and abundance of wildlife.This place is just a tourist trap. Poor value for money and a long way to go to see very little. Not recommended."

Well, after the day trip i took i was pleasantly surprised. Id like to start off by commenting on the negative responses ive read from other reviewers. These people have no idea what the difference between a safari and game reserve is. To start , a safari trip will run you about 1200.00 US dollars per day. On top of that, you'd have to travel a day to get there. This is game reserve where alot of the animals were born on thea premises. Some of the animals have been killed by poachers. Lets not forget, this reserve is 800 acres large, this not a zoo.As far as the lions being caged is just not true. They are however confined to a huge parcel of land and terrain to free roam within a fenced area. The reason they arent released completely yet is because of bordering property owners are still working out details. This is a fairly new reserve it takes time to fill it. Especially if there breeding within the reserve. The cages across from the reserve with cougars are rescued animals that were doomed if not saved. This is a funded project to save animals and i commend Aquila for there rescue efforts.  Id recommend this to anyone who cant afford to see the big 5 in the true wild. This is the next best thing and much safer. I saw the same animals and very close. They were all very healthy and happy. The zebras were plentiful and amazing. The rhinos were very active and playful."

The service and explanations from the tour guide were great but one was left to wonder when he told us that three quaters of their girraffes had died on their premises. Why they had decided to breed animals in an environment that was not all adapted to the animals was a mystery and another reason this place is a zoo rather than a safari. It was an expensive visit and we opted to drive ourselves there, for those arriving in the morning on a one day visit do take advantage of thebuffet breakfast being served. The ticket only mentions refreshments on arrival and lunch, but apparently you are welcome to breakfast.The tour although has nice touches like stopping in the middle to stretch your legs, gaze at the animals and have a glass of sparkling wine.

I visited Aquila Game Reserve with my wife for a day trip on December the 27th 2012 and we had a fantastic experience.For those who are considering paying the extra to be picked up from Cape Town I\u2019d highly recommend doing the drive yourself, it\u2019s a very simply route effectively on one road the whole way there and can easily be completed in two hours. The directions provided on the website are concise and all that you need, no Sat Nav required.Based on some of the reviews here I feel that people need to go to Aquila with the realistic expectations. Aqula Game Reserve is just that, a private game reserve. If you are expecting/want a safari trip through the untamed outback then this is not for you.If you wish to see the big 5 (& far more besides) in an environment that is as close as possible to natural then you should certainly give Aquila a try. The pricing is reasonable, the guide that we had was highly knowledgeable about all of the animals in the park and the tour itself lasted for just over two hours.Aquila is a managed park, the area is large, the animals are not penned in and are free to roam wherever they wish. Due to strategically placed watering holes they tend to congregate in certain areas which the drivers know well and take their guests to.For the price of a day trip you will receive a buffet breakfast upon arrival, a two hour driven tour and a buffet lunch upon your return (two meals also included in the afternoon session). I felt that the food was not of the highest quality, edible certainly, but none the less quite a disappointment considering the rest of the service provided.Overall this was a great experience for us, the whole park is well run and the staff were very friendly, go with the right expectations and we feel that you will enjoy your visit, 4 stars."

While it is not a wild game safari where you spend days looking for the animals in the wild, it is indeed a great wildlife experience. Our guide for the first safari was not that great. But we asked to head ranger about going to the rescue center across the road and she was very surprised that we had not been there. After that we were put with Daniel, who was absolutely amazing in his knowledge of the animals and their behavior. In the second drive we saw four of the big five. While we had seen the lions at the watering hole in the morning, in the afternoon they were moving up into the hills where they hunt at night. Daniel was very agressive in getting us as close as possible to them. Likewise, he was very good and getting the elephants close to us and telling us a lot about their habits. The next morning he took us to the rescue center. We were actually able to pet the cheetahs there. As a cat love, it was a great thrill. So no, we did not see herds of animals stampeding across the plains, but we got up close and personal with most of them. It makes for great photos. The hotel is \"rustic chic\" if there is such a term. The entire facility is very environmentally friendly and all power is solar power, so recommend taking a shower at the end of the day when the sun has provided lots of hot water. Otherwise, it might be a quick cold shower in the morning. It was very cold when we were there so a cold outdoor shower is a fast shower. The food was mediocre in the dining room. The breakfast was good but lunch and dinner seemed to be repetitive. I, too, would suggest an a la carte menu for overnight guests. All in all, our first trip to South Africa was great and Aquila and the animals were a highlight for me. They do need to improve the selection in the gift shop."

My 15 year old Grandaughter loved it and on the plus side you were able to see all the animals unlike a true safari which of course by its very nature is truly hit and miss. Yes the viewing was very contrived and I am not sure I liked the small pens or the poor lonely giraffe with her 'who am I' look. It was good to see elephants, springbok, eland, rhinos, zebra and even little giraffe up close and the obligatory champagne was most welcome. Our guide/driver was fairly knowledgable but we were a little concerned about the flat tyre especially in the Lion's enclosure - we survived. If you are looking for true back to nature then this place is not for you. If you just want to see animals in a semI natural habitat and you don't have much time then why not!"

Yet showing little variation. Should you stay longer than 2 days, you'll get the same choice over and over.The safari in itself will disappoint those who already are seasoned safari goers, as they may describe Aquila like a zoo. I beg to differ as it's still very spred out, and a perfect initiation to the profanes who have less time to go in the wild. Kruger Park for instance is so huge that you need to stay at least 3 days. It takes between 5 and 6 hours by car from Joburg. Unlike Aquila that's less than 2 hours from Cape Town, and where you can enjoy a wonderful sample of the wildlife.That's why I think it doesn't really compare but offers the best of a private reserve."

Our guide, Abriel was friendly, chatty and very knowledgabe about all the animals we saw and patiently answered all of our 7 year olds questions..We saw elephants, rhino, buffalo, rhino, zebra, springbok, giraffe, eland and hippos. The previous reviewers criticism that some animals were caged is ill informed as this is the seperate consevation centre and the leopard, cheetah and lions here have been rescued and cannot be returned to the wild as couldn't fend for themselves .All in all a great experience, enhanced by a beautiful South African backdrop and some very friendly hosts."

Not only were they caged, but the cages are almost smaller than in my hometown zoo. The tour through the actual reserve was rather touristy. We drove for an hour (and saw elephants, buffalos, rhinos, zebras and other animals) and then stopped in the middle of nowhere in order to have a glass of champagne?! The other people probably enjoyed it, but I thought it was extremly annoying to spend 30 min of a 2.5 h tour with drinking champagne. I just wanted to see the wild and the animals, but everything was mainly about breakfast, lunch and the mentioned champagne. Very disappointing to me at least."

The staff were friendly throughout our stay and always willing to assist. We had an excellent guide on our game drive. Due to the smallish nature of the reserve, we got to see the animals quite close which was great, but to counter that you always seem to have the lodge in sight, so you don't get that true safari feeling. The horseback safari was also a very good experience, although we didn't get much feedback from the guides this time & you cover the same area as the game drive, only less of it. The accomodation was average and looks like it needed a bit of freshening up. The food in the restuarant was nothing special, but being a buffet, there was a good enough variety."

I will mostly certainly NOT recommend Aquila Private Game Reserve to anyone, let alone tourists!My first visit to this establishment was in 2009 - the experience was a rather pleasant one - I had booked a day trip (Game Drive / Safari) for 3 people which included breakfast, game drive & lunch. My guests were impressed with every facet of the package (maybe except for lazy, sleepy Lions) & left in high spirits & enriched by their experience.I was treated very well not having joined in for the safari - gee I wanted to bring out friends, family & business partners to witness & experience what i had & suggested overnighting for an even better experience.Fast forward to 2012 - many people worth there salt in the tourism industry had warned me off Aquila with a mixture of personal experiences & anecdotes why I should not take tourists there. I was told it was a rip-off, service was poor & the place was disorganised. I countered that my experience had been a good one & would not believe it. I took some tourists to Inverdoorn in February this year for an overnight safari & told them the next day, upon being asked which establishment I would have chosen, without hesitation I said Aquila even though the service & experience at Inverdoorn had been a good one.Well - my perceptions & long-held view was knocked for a six today. DISORGANISED, RUDE, CONTEMPTIOUS & UNPROFESSIONAL (manager shouting a staff in front of clients just does not do it for me) are the words that come to mind. I could not believe how bad it was or had become -obviously aggressive marketing is probably the reason for folk wanting to experience Aquila. I will not be returning or promoting this place for the foreseeable future to any clients, family or friends as it is a rip off..."

Spacious suites, fresh crisp linen, with Lovely oversized bed which allowed all my kids to snuggle up in bed with the bedroom fire killing the chill in the room. There was sufficient heaters, even in the bathroom which made the frosty nights pleasant and comfortable. It is a holiday destination I would recommend for family holidays. I recommend that you take a warm winter cap, gloves, jackets and neck scarf with on the game drive, especially the evening drive that start when temps are higher and ends when temps drop very low. I however wish there would be more activity suited for the 10-15 year category."

If you're looking for wild game roaming the bush of Africa, this isn't the best place. From what I can ascertain, there aren't many of those places left. If you find such a safari, it is unlikely that you will see all the animals you want; it will be more expensive and it will be much more remote, not just a couple of hours from a major city like Cape Town. I went to Aquila because I had one day to get out of town during a hectic three week working tour of South Africa. I couldn't go back to the US without some photos and a chance to see the countryside. It was a nice day, bouncing around and looking at animals who are living more or less in the wild but are used to people. They feed the animals just before the tour so they know where to find them. They are busy eating so they stand still for pictures. They are wild enough that they act out - like the elephant who went to beat up the rhinos who got too close. But they were tame enough that we could get pretty close and we weren't terrified by any attacks by wild animals. The welcome was standard but warm enough. Our driver clowned a little and made us laugh in an endearing way. We took a break for a glass of wine mid-trip (but no bathrooms after you leave the lodge). Though the site seems to say that lunch is part of the deal, it isn't. I got a nice buffet breakfast for no extra charge but paid for lunch. The price was reasonable, just unexpected."

We had to make our own way to Chalet 19 which was not signboarded as there was no-one available to guide us there. Chalet was shabby and in need of a revamp, no chair available in the room, dirty kettle, spare duvets smelly and soiled, tissue box only had 2 tissues, great having wood in fireplace plus candles but no matches. Buffet dishes, whilst traditionally African and well presented, were mainly without flavour. Fortunately, our game rangers, game drive and horseback safari were fantastic.

They had a little playground for kids and a swimming pool we intended to make use of after the safari, unfortunately the weather was coldish and damp. It was a bit disappointing (though reassuring since we had a 3 year old with is)that the animals were so used to the vehicles. I had this expectation that a safari would be exciting, but it felt like we were driven around a zoo leaving little, if any, feeling of wilderness. Our guide Sam was outstanding. Sharing information, getting the group to actively participate with his wit. I was a bit surprised to find the (few) encaged animals to be in confounded space when seemingly there was a vast emptiness surrounding that area."

The facilities are superb, we stayed in a lovely chalet where we could hear lions at night, the restaurant and meals were great - plus we could watch 10 different species from our table. The lodge, lounge and pool areas were lovely and all staff were helpful and friendly - plus it was great value as we went in low season. A great introduction to wildlife - with comfort and hospitality!

There is a tub in the bathroom with a shower extension as well as an outdoor shower. Don't let the middle of winter deter you from using the outdoor shower. Other guests encouraged me to give it a try and I'm glad I did for a memorable experience. The buffet had a wide array of food options and you certainly won't go hungry. Drinks are not included (except coffee, tea and juice at breakfast). While we were here we went out on three jeep tours and once on horseback. The rangers are knowledgeable (try to get Daniel if you can) and they do their best to make sure you see a wide array of animals. Yes, it's a game reserve and not a \"real\" safari but it was still enjoyable and I saw lots of animals in the open. Don't skip the horseback ride or the rehab center where I got to pet a cheetah."

It is a wonderful drive from Cape Town through breath taking countryside. It takes about 2/3 hours. We arrived and saw what we were expecting. A typical, African style hut building (modern) which looked fantastic in front of the mountains and country. We checked in and walked through the resort to our 'villa'. The room was small, but for two people was fine. It was hygienic and there were beverages on the desk next to some matches and a wood fire, should we choose to light it. The beds were comfortable, and with the silent surroundings, the quality of sleep was fantastic. The bathroom was surprisingly modern. The toilet was clean, and there was a large indoor bathtub or an outdoor shower with 4 walls and no roof. There was buffalo right outside our door, but behind a fence which was always a surprise when we left in the morning. Breakfast and dinner is all included and is a buffet. the dining room is lovely, typically African but modern. Air conditioning and glass windows. The food is mediocre. Not fantastic and we found that some food is left for a while before being taken away and new food put out.The Safari was great, however I would strongly advise you wrap up warm. Extra clothing is provided but it can become extremely cold. Also, use the toilet before you leave! We saw all the animals I wanted to see including Lions, Rhinos, Hippos, Zebras, Gazelles and many more. There's always great photo opportunities. It was a great experience I would certainly stay again if ever in this part of the world."

I have visited several animal reserves over the past few years, so I know that each one has its own flavor. One should be wary of comparing one reserve to another--each is it's own experience.

I was surprised to read the positive reviews here,, as our experience was average enoughWe enjoyed our trip to Aquila, it was magical to see the animals up close, and definitely better than any zoo.However there are some things to be aware of...-the accommodation is quite basic, and it was very cold when we were there (my son pointed out that it was the winter though!), and didn't feel very clean. There were mice pellets on the floor, not ideal as we had a toddler- the food was adequate, but not excellent. Breakfast was ok, dinner was fine, but lunch not great. All buffet style food, cold and lots of flies- The bar wasn't very clean, and a mouse ran across the floor in front of our table- there wasn't much for kids to do when not on the game drives. The website advertised kids quad bikes, but they didn't exist, and the children play room wasn't well maintained or equipped, which was a pityThe game drives were great, provided you don't mind the fact that the game are fenced in. It didn't bother us, it was still lovely to see them roaming around. The evening felt more authentic than the morning one, which felt a little staged since the animals had just been fed. However the morning drive was quite magical, to be in a beautiful setting at sunriseWe did enjoy the game experience, but a day trip would have been a better option for us, as we didn't find the accommodation to be of a great standard.If Aquila had a little face life and improved the facilities, it would be great, As it stands i couldn't recommend it as a hotel. -"

One of my best experiences in Cape Town!I was picked up at my hotel at 7 a.m. (thankfully I was the last person picked up, so I didn't have to be in the car while they collected the other six people from hotel to hotel). The driver (Haymi) was very friendly and professional, knew lots of interesting and fun facts all the way to the reserve. Once there, we had 20 minutes for breakfast, not particularly great but I wasn't there to eat. Getting into the safari vehicle was a bit messy. Basically, just pick whichever car you want. Two tips:1. They have big and smaller cars, the smaller ones are more comfortable and you're much more likely to seat in the window sides and get better pictures.2. You can also seat with the driver, which is great for pictures and to ask questions.The driver (Daniel) was very nice and really made an effort to make sure we got to see all \"Big Five,\" plus giraffe, zebras, etc. The elephants were high in the mountain for a while, but he kept an eye and we ended up seeing them walk by our car. He drove for quite a bit to find the buffalos and we eventually ran into a couple of them. We followed the rhinos for a bit and it was great to see them run. We also saw lots interesting things (the lions mating, the buffalos butting heads over the food, one rhino taking a gigantic leak, the zebras militarily following their leader in a line, etc.).Lunch was not great either, sort of cold, dessert was great. Drinks are NOT included in the package, so you have to pay for your coke, water, tea, etc.Overall, definitely worth the money."

We were picked up at the hotel and had to get up at 6 a.m. in the morning, With our excitement it was natural to do so, however, once we learned that more people from other hotels had to be picked up yet, the mood went down. Other people were late and we arrived 3 hours later in an uncomfortable bus to the safari area of Ceres. It was bitterly cold and the Aquila safari staff would happily invite us to buy a jacket. For the money spent, I better didn't freeze, so ok. We then learned that the ostrich farm was under construction and would not be included anymore. The compensation we had to ask for ourselves was an independent trip to a farm far away on another day, what a ridiculous voucher offer! We didnt want to spill our good hopes and fair mood, so we had the free breakfast on site. Before we arrived, they already started cleaning up and rushing us to get on the safari wagon. Many people were on the wagon, so it didnt seem to have a personal touch. We saw 4 of the Big 5, but everything was rather disappointing because the animals were so far away. We had far better seeings and views on other trips in zoos, or even in the wild for free. The Aquila safari was not wild, so even the animals looked like animals from the zoo, but just very far away. The lunch was ok, but we had to rush back already, 3 more hours on the bus back to Cape Town. What a wast of money! We paid 4000 Rand, an amount you could do so many more nice things for in and around Cape Town! I would rather spend the money on things like the Peninsula drive, winelands, the aquarium and great lunches and dinners."

The staff was everywhere and made our trip wonderful and easy with the kids, something we feel is critical when we have our kids with us. We started with a swim in the resort pool which makes you feel as though you are swimming in the wilderness. The food was buffet style and of a very high calibre, and there was a huge selection, appetisers, entr\u00e9es and dessert. Breakfast was the real treat though, every breakfast indulgence you can imagine. Nothing beats fried eggs on home-made toast and boerewors while looking out on the African sunset! We enjoyed a number of game drives where we saw the big 5 which simply put, blew my kids minds. We got to track elephants and see them behave in their natural habitat. We got up close as is allowed to Rhino\u2019s which were incredible. In addition to the big 5 we saw a big variety of other animals, some quite exotic like the Blue Wildebeest. The safari drive did not feel canned at all and the ranger that escorted us definitely knew what she was doing.

If you are looking for a game reserve near Cape Town I would definitely go there."

Me and a friend had booked a trip to Aquila , as even though we both south Africans we actually have never yet been on a safari before.So we decided now was the time , on arrival at the gate we already felt so welcome and got handed a warm refreshing towel (which was such a thoughtful gesture after our almost 2 hour ride to the reserve) and of course welcoming bubbly on arrival too.We were then escorted to the cigar lounge area were we enjoyed a small continental breakfast of croissants , muffins , tea , coffee and juices before the start of our game drive. Our game drive lasted almost approximately 3 hours and it was just fantastic! We had the best ranger ever: Winston, he explained every detail of the reserve to us as well as supplied us with some interesting facts and general knowledge of the animals in the reserve. I think we came the perfect time of the year as all the animals were out we saw giraffes , Zebras , buffalo , lions , hippos , elephants and many more. After our magnificent game drive we enjoyed a wonderful buffet lunch ( a truly African cuisine) in there amazing animal themed restaurant absolutely mind blowing. This is when we decided that we could not only come for the day we had to experience this wonderful reserve in all it has to offer and decided to spend the night there.We got a fantastic room ( the honey moon cabin) wow what a room! Had that perfect cabin feel, with a wood fire light for us , bath and Jacuzzi and a very comfortable bed and not to forget to mention the incredible view of the reserve. We proceeded to have our evening game drive (which was just as fantastic as the morning drive as we got to see the animals we never really saw up close we got to have that experience. After our drive we were treated to a wonderful buffet dinner laid out by the staff, there was so much food I can\u2019t even begin to type it all out! An all in all wonderful experience, I want to personally thank all the staff and management team at Aquila you really made us feel really welcome and provided excellent guest service! We will most indefinitely be back!"

If you look at your experience at this beautiful place as game reserve and not a huge national park (like the Kruger) you are in for a fantastic experience. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the accommodation was superb! (we were in the honeymoon chalet) There is something magical about sitting in the jacuzzi overlooking the game reserve that takes your breath away! You are likely to see most of the big 5, because of the reserve's size, but having said that, seeing the lions feed was jaw dropping and an experience we will never forget, we have been to the Kruger national park and have not experienced anything like that before! We had our 2 year old son with us and he loved every second of it, there is even a huge kids playground and putt putt area to keep them entertained. Thanks Aquila for an unforgettable stay."

My wife and i stayed at Aquila for one night on 19 April 2012 and had a great time, but as we were to leave the following morning after the game drive and subsequent breakfast she discovered that her credit card and some cash were missing from her handbag which was left in our LOCKED cottage as we assumed that we would be safe from crime at this luxury lodge.There was no signs of forced entry and it was mutually accepted that a key was used to gain entry to our cottage.In spite of living in South Africa my wife has never been the victim of crime and was visibly upset.The police was called and i had to postpone a meeting in Cape Town as she had to submit a statement and after this travelled to Worcester (a nearby town) to have her other cards inspected for fingerprints by a forensic office as these were shuffled by the criminal who was obviously only in search of her credit card.Aquila management were reluctant to disclose how many of these incidents have happened in the past, but it is obvious that this was not an isolated incident as the police confirmed other cases.In spite of the inconvenience and trauma to my wife, Aquila management has made no attempt whatsoever to contact us to even offer an apology or update us on the investigation.Please let this be a warning to all that even Aquila Private \"Luxury\" Game Reserve cannot guarantee that you will not become a victim of crime, and if you do, they will show no compassion."

We were upgraged to a luxury chalet which we greatly appreciated that was absolutely beautiful. The game drives we went on were very cool. We saw several different animals and were able to get very close to elephants and lions. The people commenting about it being more of an amusement park or a zoo...it's a game preserve, it isn't Kruger. As far as I am aware this is about as close as you'll get to seeing wildlife in their natural environments anywhere near Cape Town. We had a great time here. I would highly recommend doing the overnight stay, the sunset was beautiful and the view of the stars after dark was amazing."

We were based in Cape Town, and wanted to fit in a two day trip a game reserve on our trip. We had small children in our party and so needed to pick a malaria free zone. Aquila from all the information provided, seemed like the best choice.Turned out not to be so much of a game reserve, more a like a large zoo, with some accomodation and a swimming pool.PositivesGreat as a day trip from Cape Town, if you have small children and want to show them some animals without spending a lot of time driving round looking for them.Guaranteed to see the big fiveIts a nice drive from Cape TownAccomodation wasn't too bad - clean and reasonably comfortable.NegativesLions - trapped in a smallish area, seemed to be overfed (food is provided for them, they aren't wild)Drivers have very basic knowledge of animals, but not the detailed level of knowledgeyou'd expect from a guide in a game reserve. As it is in the desert the game reserve probably can't sustain a vast number of animals (hence extra grass is fed to them daily), but still only having a handful of each animal was a bit odd. I was expecting to see vast plains full of herds of elephants/giraffe/wildebeast etc, not just one or two. Didn't feel the 'magic' everyone talks about, when they speak about being out in a game reserve.As the animals were fed, they stayed around the feeding areas, in fact on the three drives we did, we didn't even have to look hard for the animals, they were pretty much in the same place each time. Take the fun out of looking for wild animals. I suspect most of these have been in capitvity most of thier lifes.Food - wasn't great - the same food on offer for both lunch and dinner. If you are visiting the reserve for a day trip, then the food probably wouldn't be too bad, but as we were there for two nights it was very disppointing.Didn't like to see the cheetah and leopards in such small cages in the rescue centre across the road. Difficult to know what the story was about this place, as there was no information/education to explain why they were there.Unclean swimming pools - need more attention, only one was fully functional.Things they could do to improve:Offer an al a carte menu option for guests staying overnightOffer the option for guests to cook a bbq outside thier own accomodationImprove the educational element of the place/employ experts to assist the drivers. If this is targeted at day trippers from Cape Town, and families, have educational information for the kids about the animals, so they can learn on the trip.I would only recommend going here as a day trip - but don't expect anything more than a large expensive zoo."

Also, the tour on the ostrich farm was quite nice. The game drive, however, was not that interesting. I suppose there are limits to how amazing it can be when what you really wish to see is those animals out in the wild, and we did get to see the big 5 as well as zebras, springbok, cheetas, and such. So if you find yourself in Cape Town and you don't have time for a proper safari, then this is a decent option. If you are not desperate to see lions and elephants, then save it for another time when you can see them in their right habitat."

            "review": "barely worth zoo admission!. I planned to take my friend to a game drive as we only had an extra day in Cape Town and no time to go to the Kruger Park. I asked the concierge at the hotel and he recommended Aquila as it was the best variety of wildlife and not as he said, \"Noah's Ark\" (2 of each animal). We drove ourselves out the two hours from Cape Town and the drive is beautiful. We saved nearly $100 per person in doing so. On arrival, they met us with drinks and pastries. At 10:15 the drive was to commence, but there was NO organization and it was nearly a free for all to the vehicles. Our driver was nice, respectful, and courteous, however not engaging or had little to say. I sat in the front and was able to ask questions, but few if any of the answers were shared with the 20 other people in our group. As for the drive and \"safari\", I have been spoiled by safari in the Kruger Park and private reserves, so I did not expect it to be anything equal. This was embarrassing though. They have 2 teenage male elephants, 3 young giraffes which you couldnt get close to as they were penned away, and 5 cape buffalo that they actually pushed near the road so the guests could take pictures of them. From there they have assorted springbok, \u00e9lan, zebra and ostrich. They have 4 white rhinos which are very impressive, however, as they were poached last year, it appears they have a 24 guard watching their every move. Lastly, their 7 lions are in what I would call a small pen enclosure. The guide said there was wild game for them to hunt in there, but no one believed him.Overall, it was a poor experience and I would NOT recommend for anyone. The price is exorbitant for the experience which is nothing more than a large, underpopulated zoo. I commend them for their efforts and maybe in 5-10 years they will have a worthwhile adventure. As for now, I left very disappointed and tired from 4 hours of driving."

It was quite an experience having a bath surrounded by mountain rock.Long after our stay, we were still fantasizing over the food...especially the deserts.My 6 year old son chose to go quadbiking, where we followed a game ranger on his quadbike (just outside the main animal enclosure) and were lucky to spot buffalo right by the gate. The other enticing option for children was the pony ride (which we did not do - next time). There is also a large play area for children and my kids had a ball. We thoroughly enjoyed the jeep safari rides, though it was a bit scary getting so close to the lions (luckily they were busy feasting on the remains of some animal).All of us, adults and children, had a fantastic time and I would highly recommend a visit to Aquila, especially for families."

There does not appear to be a sufficient number of staff to take care of the number of guests and when you do manage to locate a member of staff, they are bored and disinterested and clearly have no concept of customer service. Check in: Disorganised & disinterested staff, no efficiency and do not make you feel welcome. Don't even recall a welcoming smile. Oh and the reception toilets are a good indication of the quality and cleanliness of the the rest of the premises. Do not expect to have your case taken to your chalet, you must drag your own luggage all the way from the car, through other guests who are sitting around the pool, all the way to your chalet and finally up the steps to the chalet door. Now I'm not lazy and am not adverse to carrying my own luggage, but really?! In a four star establishment I expect someone else to do it for me.Food: Meal times are a communal canteen style affair, with unappealing looking offerings in steel catering trays. The quality and taste of the food was poor so don't arrive hungry! It is self service and due to the vast numbers of day trippers it is quite a scrum to get to the food. Also, they appear not to restrict numbers, so don't be too surprised if you cannot get a table. As lunch was so dreadful I was not really looking forward to dinner - it was equally poor. Broadly the same sort of food on offer and again self service. The evening meal experience for my fiance and me lasted all of 20 minutes (that includes the walk to the cafeteria and serving ourselves) - we basically wanted to get some fuel inside us and get out of there. I glanced around at the other diners and not one looked like they were having a good time. We congratulated ourselves on having the foresight to bring biltong and a couple of bottles of wine with us, which we enjoyed back at our chalet.Chalet: We stayed in one of the supposed Premier Chalets, I dread to think what the Standard ones are like! Certainly does not warrant 4 stars. The chalet we stayed in was cheaply knocked together, cramped and the bedding was not quite as white as you would expect it to be! Ranger: I will call him a driver as he demonstrated none of the qualities that a true game ranger posseses. This one was clearly bored and disinterested and did not appear to be able to offer any knowledge about the animals or the surrounding landscape.I did have to smile to myself at the opening lines from our driver. Something about the animals being free roaming and wild so there really is only a 50% chance of seeing anything. What a load of rubbish, these animals are like farm animals. Hay is put out in a clearing so naturally the grazing animals migrate to that spot. There are two man made water holes, so you're probably going to spot the hippo in one of the two. The lions (very bored looking lions) are in a separate relatively small enclosure so are not too tricky to locate. In order to fill up the duration of the drive, expect to spend a ridiculous amount of time staring at springbok and ostrich.On returning to the base at the end of the drive, the driver somewhat unenthusiastically asked did everyone enjoy that......I've seen people looking more animated in a doctors waiting room.We decided to give the 6am game drive a miss as we weren't going to see anything different to the previous evening's drive. We also skipped breakfast as we couldn't face the whole unpleasant dining experience again. If Aquila genuinely is a rehabilitation centre then it does not surprise me that there is a relatively small quantity of game. However, I question whether Aquila truly is a rehabilition centre as I would have expected the ranger/driver to be able to talk about how a particular lion of rhino came to be at Aquila, where they were rescued from etc.......Now, Aquila's slogan is 'Real safari, real close to Cape Town'. This is not a safari and should never be advertised as one, It is, at best an animal farm. In summary, the management is dreadful and I don't see any evidence of the money they're taking being re-invested back into the place. I believe their ethos is pack 'em in, take their money. This establishment is not about repeat business! Don't go, you will feel ripped off and disappointed, rather save your money and put it towards a proper safari where the staff actually care about your enjoyment and comfort.Once you have eaten in the cafeteria and been on your game drive there really is nothing to do. So, if you're not big on conversation then advise taking a good book to read.A few positives: The girl serving at the poolside bar was very cheery and I did manage to locate a member of staff and borrow a corkscrew for the aforementioned bottles of wine. The scenery on the drive from Cape Town to Aquila is stunning."

The game ranger must've had a bad day, but this is no excuse. He was simply shocking and for me that was the killer blow.

Despite already having visited a number of these sort of semi-wild game reserves, he too found it very enjoyable.The time spent in the safari trucks was fruitful: we saw everything apart from the lions, who unhelpfully chose to stay well out of sight. The elephants were impressive and we were quite close (ca. 5m) to them on a few occasions: sufficiently so that the driver had to reverse out of the wayto avoid the truck being pushed back down the track!We were also fortunate to see a recently-born baby rhino, which was cute and endearing - even to two 40 year old blokes! Zebra were ten-a-penny and antelope too.After a decent stint touring round, we stopped for a refreshing glass of sparkling wine - a very nice touch as the temperature rose - and to stretch our legs in a safe part of the reserve. We then headed to the other side of the road to view some rehabilitation enclosures where we did see lion, warthogs and a beautiful leopard.All-in-all, a thoroughly enjoyable few hours out. I would love to return with my girlfriend and spend a night or two in the nice-looking safari lodges."

I was suprised to read some of the other reviews on this site..... if I had read those reviews before my first trip I might not have visited this great reserve.We have stayed in the rondavel accomodation and recently (as an anniversary suprise) we stayed in the honeymoon chalet. The view from that chalet is amazing but (being a woman :) ) it was the bathroom that made the chalet. The natural rock has been left in the room and surrounds the bath! The four poster bed was another highlight. My daughter loved the tame peacock which roams the reception area and had a ball hand feeding the ostriches at the ostrich ranch down the road.We went on a horseback safari and were pleasantly suprised. Neither of us are great horse riders so we were a little apprehensive but the horses were well behaved and made us look like pro's :)I enjoy the fact that the reserve functions as a wild game reserve and a rehabilitation centre where animals are kept in enclosures with the aim of releasing back onto the reserve once they are ready. The food at Aquila was great with everything from potjies and baboeties to lamb, chicken and fish. Even my fussy 2 year old happily munched away. My favourite was their sticky toffee pudding!We will definitely be back there soon."

There are some great things about the reserve - fantastic location if you are coming from Cape Town, at the far edge of the Hex River Valley - picturesque drive there, very enjoyable visit to the Ostrich farm (part of Aquila) , knowledgeable game keepers throughout and very friendly staff. The accommodation was basic but very comfortable. The reserve does feel confined but to be fair, the western cape is is not really the area of huge game reserves. On the negative side, lovely pool (visibly) but absolutely freezing. Why not heated? There is an abundance of solar energy around. Food was a let down, reason being was that the plates weren't warmed, food wasn't warmed, chicken was uncooked and the lighting in the restaurant was poor. Variety of food was good. Annoyed at no drinks price list at dinner."

Aquila is a responsible game reserve, the animals are well treated and except for those rescued and places in rehabilitation program, are not kept in cages, as suggested in previous reviews. In fact the space they can move is so big that we couldn't even see all the animals. We saw Lyons, elephants, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, zebras, gnus and ostriches. In the rehabilitation centre we saw a tiger, but we missed the cheetah, again because it wasn\u2019t kept in a cage, but in a large fences space. The food is indeed basic, but we didn\u2019t come for the food. This is not a Kenyan safari, but nevertheless we loved it and the price wasn\u2019t too expensive. We booked it through Cape Point Route travel agent and we paid less then booking it with Aquila itself."

            "review": "Worst experience ever. To whom it may concernMy wife and I had a booking at Aquila Game Reserve for the 8th and 9th November 2011 to celebrate our honeymoon. I had seen Aqulia advertised in the SA Express flight Magazine. The advert expressed an extravagant 4 star Game Reserve in the outskirts of the Western Cape. The advert looked very appealing and attractive which caught our eye as four star is what we were set out for on our honeymoon. Unfortunately 4 star is far from the experience we received at Aquila Game Reserve. On arrival at reception the welcoming was disappointing. We were told to arrive at 13:30 for 14:00 for welcoming drinks which were not offered. On booking into the \u201c4 Star\u201d unit we were informed that our room was not ready and that we should go on a horse ride first. On arriving at the horse arena, we had to wait unattended not knowing where to go or what to do. We had to approach reception to find out where to go and what to do. On mounting a horse we were told that this is there third 2 hour trip for the day and that they horses were way too tired to actually walk anywhere. According to the guide this is there normal daily routine doing three trips tiring the horses. My wife found the trip nerve racking as her horse felt like it wanted to collapse before we even left the resort area. The tour guide had to walk my horse out of the resort area into the wild before it actually followed the other horses way behind. It was clear he was way too tired for a third trip. The guide asked my wife what language she spoke then ignored her and spoke Afrikaans the whole way which I find disrespectful.On arriving at our room just after 4pm, which we had to wait for because it was not clean, we walked into a room which looked 2 star. The walls were filthy, there was toilet paper lying over the bath along side a dead fly and the outside shower had looked like it had not been cleaned in days. This is the room we had to wait for because it was not ready. When you pay top dollar for a 4 star room you at least expect the room to be cleanly painted and smelling fresh. Not walk into a room looking worse than shack. The following day at midday when arriving at the quad bike arena for our booking, we were left stranded once again. On walking into reception there was no booking reflected on their records for our so called booking we made when arriving. The person booking us in just laughed and had no signs of any apology when pointing to him as the one signing us in and making the booking. After a 20minute we were brought two old quad bikes and not the new red Honda bikes they used the day before. These bikes did not even idle and had to be held at an angle to ride straight. That afternoon at about 1pm when arriving back at our room, our unit had not even been cleaned as yet. For a so called 4 star rating, this is so not accepted. We had sat in the bar lounge but left this areas too due to the couches smelling like moth balls. We decided not to stay the second night and book out of Aquila losing a lot of money as the experience we received from Aquila is not what expected when you look at the extravagant adverts. After chatting to other guests it was clear that their experience was the same as ours. When I arrived at reception to book out a day early I was not even asked why. Clearly a no care attitude from the staff and MANAGEMENT as to date I have not received a call from Aquila.I have stayed in several Game Reserves over the years as i am a keen wild life person, this is clear the most expensive and most definitely the worst resort and experience I have had in my entire life. The wild life seen in the reserve in minimal and appears to be more of an exotic zoo with lions in a enclosed area rather the roaming the entire reserve which is why visitors are guaranteed sightings. One disappointment to the other leads us to this letter.RegardsPaul & Karen Smith[--]"

The brochure stated they had the BIG five PLUS baboons, giraffes, cheetahs etc etc. I selected this tour because I had the tourist office call a day before to check if they had all animals as advertised and they said YES. So imagine my disappointment when we get there and I ask where are the giraffes? and I am told 'the vegetation doesnt allow them to have giraffes.\" Then why advertise that you do?? That was my issue, if you dont have the animals, dont say you do!! I was so upset. I really wanted to see giraffes. And there were no cheetahs as well! The lions were caged, more of a zoo than a reserve. This tour is not the cheapest so I expect to get my money's worth. I sure didnt.There was another company that had all the animals and you can even walk with the giraffes-go with them. Aquila is recommended by most tourist offices but dont fall into the trap that I did, spend your money elsewhere."

Aquila Game Reserve is in a malaria free area 2 hours drive from Cape Town city centre. On a arrival we had a buffet breakfast, followed by a 3 hour game drive. The game drive was very educational and the game ranger was highly experienced. The big 5 and many other species of buck can be viewed at the game reserve. We had a wonderful buffet lunch. The game reserve caters for vegetarians and Halaal meals. After lunch everybody relaxed around the swimming pool and enjoyed the afternoon. A cigar lounge and bar is available. We returned via the scenic Cape Winelands for wine tasting and visiting the prison in Paarl where Nelson Mandela spent his last few years before being released. I highly recommend this Private Game Reseve for day and overnight visits. The game reserve has a 4 star grading."

The Lions enclosure is tiny and this is really NOT how I wanted to see the big five. No, I haven't had much experience of other safaris, just one day visit to Pilanesberg and a few days in a private reserve in Kwa Zulu Nathal. But I have had plenty of disappointing visits to hotels where the guests are treated like sheep and the whole experience is like a holiday camp. This place is one of those, with very good marketing, making it seem like a safari. DO NOT BE FOOLED, THIS IS A ZOO CASHING IN ON THE SAFARI CUSTOMER WHO DOESN'T LOOK AT THE FENCES.

Side costs are moderate, stuff friendly, food well prepared and with a high hygienic standard. the aquila is child friendly, has a extra child area, and a mini golf place, which our son loved.the appartments are efficient, not luxury , but compared to other safari resorts, upper standard. we recommend the family suites, airconditioned and beautifully placed , nice interior. the other condos are a standard in quality, no views! the safari was nice , altrhough it is not the \"real\" Kr\u00fcger Park, but for kids , and specially malarias free, it is worth going there. Pool area is ok, water was too cold to swim, you might see some animals near to the outside area, nothing special (ostriches and buffel) but ok.the horseback safari is a must, but not allowed to smaller children, which nobody told us before arrival, that was the only negativ experience we have had at this place. reading other reviews it must be added, that it is indeed not a real safari resort, but a nice experience, and we didn t understand the mentioned \"bad quality\" of food, dinner and breakfast outstranding in variety, better than a lot of \"five\" star places we have travelled before.

First all, on arrival, you are welcomes by a ranger who escorts you to reception where you receive either champagne or orange juice. There the weekends itinerary gets explained to you, depending what package you booked. The ranger then carries your bags when he escorts you to your chalet. We were booked into chalets that were built into the rocks, the outside shower just took my breathe away, too cold to use though but would be great in summer. The whole interior just says wow. Clean and comfy and at night while sipping drinks on the balcony one can actually see game coming right up to the fence. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The game rides are amazing as well. I got to see Lions close up, even crocs and hippos. Will definitely recommend this to anyone."

Yes we did see alot of game the first drive and second none at all (how do you hide elephnats?!!?. Therefore to state this is contrived is unfair to Aquila.

The accommodation was great - we had a private cottage overlooking the reserve - and I spent an hour on our first day with a glass of wine in the bath watching the elephants roam around. I would definitely stay the night as it seemed that the day trippers didn't get nearly the same experience. My only complaint would be that the food was average at best but we went there for the animal experience not the cuisine.

Have just got back from a trip to the Western Cape, which included an overnight stay at Aquila Game Reserve.In a party of 6, we stayed in 3 non air-conditioned lodges. Which was fine in their April weather. The rooms were clean and comfortable, with a shower, bath and outdoor space at the front overlooking the game park.Included was 2 game drives, afternoon/evening and morning and on both we saw plenty of wildlife (hippo, rhino, elephant, giraffe, lions, wilder beast etc.) and our guide was very knowledgable and friendly.All food was included in the form of a buffet; lunch, dinner and breakfast. The food was delicious and hot, I and all members of our party had no complaints. Aquila catered for everyones needs.Like any private game reserve in South Africa, the animals live in the wild, but are looked after. We chose Aquila for a number of reasons;- it employs staff from the nearby Touwsriver, decreasing the unemployed within the town.- it runs entirely on solar power and can further run up to 600 nearby homes if the funding for infrastructure can be found.- rescues and treats poorly/poached animals, such as crocodiles, leopards and warthogs to enable their release back to Aquila or another suitable reserve.I and my party were not disappointed with Aquila, despite mixed reviews. The one thing I would say, if you can, spend the time on an overnight stay, rather than a tour from cape town. You will find it a more relaxed and enjoyable experience than the day tours, as they seemed to get crowded.Hope people enjoy it as much as we did."

They have a project called \u201cRescue Animal Projects\u201d and is just an excuse to turn it into a petting zoo. Is this supposed to be an african experience for tourists, than I do not know what to say."

            "review": "Rude,. Our time at Aquila was not as enjoyable as we were expecting. We started the day with a lot of complications with transportation, which we thought they were providing. We had to instead pay a taxi driver we had met earlier in the week to drive us there. We arrived to the reserve at 12:45 after rushing to make sure we were there for the 1PM ostrich farm tour. We were told when we were checking in that we were too late and we could not go to the farm. They also said we would not be compensated for this because it was \"complimentary\". We showed how they had provided it on our itinerary and explained all the earlier complications we had, but they dismissed us in a fairly rude fashion. It was obvious this place is run like a machine and that a lot of the reception staff wants nothing to do with being helpful. We asked the owner, Hans, for help and he too was snobby and dismissive. The only time he was nice to us was when he thought we were going to purchase an expensive item in the gift store. You are only allowed three meals during your stay (beverages are not included), so make sure you bring snacks for the afternoon you are leaving. The animals on the reserve are of course amazing, but it definitely feels like a glorified zoo. The only positive experience we had was with our tour guides, Colen and Andrew. They were smart, well informed, and personable. We went on the horseback ride with Andrew, which was especially pleasurable. If you go, definitely try to go a ride with them. They were both fabulous and the rest of the staff should take cues from them."

We spent 2 days here on our South African holiday. 3 of us in our party of 4 had never been to South Africa before or been on a Safari, so were excited by these 2 days. We had a really lovely time at Aquila and saw some amazing animals close up. If you have been on Safari before at one of the big reserves in South Africa then I would not recommend Aquila, it is tiny in comaprison. But if you are new to Safari and want to try it, this place is perfect. The accomodation and food was also excellent."

Our kids had come from North America for a brief visit at Xmas, and in a limited time...Aquila was a terrific place to take them to see animals, without going to a zoo. We were warmly greeted, and shown to our accomodations, which were very clean and faced out onto the veld.Lunch was a bit of a frenzy, with many groups meeting at one point over the buffet tables, but the food was tasty and the selection varied.We enjoyed the pool and some quiet time to watch some animals roaming, and then went on a game drive with Timothy. He was very enthusiastic and very knowledgeable. He had some terrific stories. We chose to sit at the back of the raised vehicle and were very pleased to have had some great close looks at all that we had seen. We had a nice sundowners on the veld.Supper was less of a stampede, and the food was very good, and there was lots of it.We had a family game of putt putt and spent the evening watching the animals near our cabins.In the morning, lions roaring woke us up and we headed out on another drive with Timothy. It was interesting to see all the animals we had, in a different part of their daily life.We had the most exhilarating time when a buff took exception to our vehicle and charged. Timothy did some fancy driving, and was at all times concerned for everyone's well being. We were all fine and definitely awake!We had a very nice stay...and the kids had a great primer to African wildlife."

In December of 2010 we took an amazing family trip to Cape Town, South Africa. Before departing on our flight from Canada to Cape Town we decided to enquire about booking a Safari adventure for our family. We spoke to the good people at Jenman Safaris in Cape Town, South Africa. As we were going with two fairly young children they suggested that Aquila would be an ideal place for a safari. We were told it catered more to a family experience! We booked a two day safari drive with a one night stay. The staff at Jenman's were very informative and service was excellent! The 130 Km drive to Aquila from Cape Town was a great visual experience. The landscape changes from fantastic views of the mountains to acres and acres of vineyards as you get closer to Touwsriver. It was a spectacular drive! Once we arrived at Aquila we were greeted with smiles and a glass of champagne for the adults and some sparkling fruit juice for the kids. The rooms were very clean and spacious. The thatched roofs really added to the charm. The Kids loved the upstairs loft and claimed it as their own. Before our evening safari drive we were treated to some excellent food at the buffet. The food was all very fresh with a good selection. It was tasty too! After our meal we got a chance to relax and unwind around the pool for a bit.In the early evening we gathered near the Aquila entrance for our Safari drive. We met our driver as well as the other families that we would travel with us in the vehicle. Romeo would be our driver for the evening as well as the second drive in the morning. After meeting everyone we all scrambled into the vehicle and set off. Once you enter the reserve it is only a matter of minutes before you see some live animals. Our driver and guide Romeo really took his time approaching the animals You don't want to startle a buffalo or a rhino. We found out that they can be very aggressive especially when cornered,. Romeo explained each animal we spotted in great detail. He talked about their habitat, diet, Life cycle and so on,. I believe that the animal info our guide provided really added to all our safari experience. Romeo not only told us about the animal itself but also included a lot of info on their life in the wild and specific details about each endangered animal and it's struggle to survive. The info on the breeding programs that Aquila are working on was also great to hear. The conversations were very open and allowed for everyone's questions large or small. Romeo even took the time to even answer the kids questions fully. It was really incredible how close we were able to get to each animal. I had not expected this and was in total awe of all the animals we got to see. Some great Kodak moments for sure! We all loved the drives and the chance to spot the animals over the two day Safari. Please note that it's not just the big 5(Buffalo, Lion, Rhino, Elephant & Leopard) you get to see. Aquila has several other animal species on the reserve. We really enjoyed watching the Hippos, Giraffes, Wildebeest, Zebras and other animals. It was funny how much a kick the kids got out of the small mongoose that we spotted darting in and out near the hippos. Aquila gave our family a safari memories for a lifetime. When we got back home to Canada our safari trip was the number 1 topic of conversation with family and friends. If you are in the Cape Town area I highly recommend the Aquila Game Reserve for a fun family time! Thank you to Romeo and all the staff at Aquila. It was a great adventure. Also thank you to Jenman Safaris for suggesting and booking our fun trip!"

When we arrived it was clear it was going to be a really bad experience.The bar area was filthy, no-one cleared up outside the restaurant and the dining arrangements were a canteen style help yourself to food - we padi over \u00a3500 for one night with two small children and felt like it was a total rip off. The reserve is a glorified safari park. They only have a few animals, 2 giraffe, a few hippo, four rhino and only two elephant, the cheeta, leapoard and lions are in caged enclosures and if you think this is a safari you are so far wrong. No-one seemed interested in cared about ttheir job. It seemed to be all about making money but the owner could make so much more if they bothered to employ more staff to keep the place tidy, go round asking if you want a rink, improved the food and other elements.It could be quite good if it had the right management. Our highlight was the drive through the mountains and hex valley to get there which was amazing. Sadly, these poor aninmals dont have much of a life. It is not much better than a Zoo. Be warned!"

Its a difficult review to write to criticise one's attempts to put together a ethically sound idea of presenting Africa at its best however i left empty hearted today having travelled across the world with my daughter (5) and husband (Indonesian - first time to Africa ) whom were promised the delights of African hospitality through my own experiences at Kruger and Zimbabwe- the treasure being near the Big 5 at the end. They were hot and bored. Yes, we saw and had the 90 second pause per 'Big Animal', a glass of nasty champagne at 9am and a hurried through a lunch service of over 100 people - queues, buffet style, however i was looking forward to more. Not because i had pre-paid the equivalent of 550 usd for us in October (we left after lunch as there is a 2 hour break before transport to an Ostrich Farm - if you dont have a villa there (very very expensive and not flash) you are left laying around.....or because we had travelled/driven the distance. But we were excited and i was simply let down by a barren graveyard of dirt and dust with these poor pre purchased animals on exhibition from a tired old van but friendly guide doing his job. I do understand if one has not explored Africa and its the one off it could pass as a good safari. Its not. Do your homework and get your money's worth hence return with the elation of Africa and what it has to offer in real terms - a lifetime experience. Do your homework first. There are plenty with heart and soul on offer....dont come all this way and go home very lacklustre."

            "review": "Worth a visit for a first Safari experience.. We have just done the overnight stay package at Aquila, this package included transfers from our Cape Town hotel to and from the Aquila Reserve, 2 game drives (1 early evening, 1 early morning), Lunch on arrival, Dinner in the Evening and Breakfast the next morning. We stayed in the top level accommodation, the Honeymoon Suite cottage number 9, this detached cottage was on a high level which gave great views of the reserve, but not suitable for people with walking or fitness difficulties. The cottage had a great four poster bed, a bathroom with bath with great view out to the reserve and an outside private jacquzzi and shower, all with excellent privacy surroundings. The Game Drives were good with very knowledgeable, experienced and professional Rangers, we saw all the Big 5 and more, however, the numbers of each animal type is limited, so if you are expecting similarties to Kruger or Sabi Sabi you are going to be disappointed, but for a first safari adventure Aquila gives you a great initiation to the safari experience. The food was adequate, all buffet style though and certainly not a high class dining environment and no Al a Carte options, there is no post dinner entertainment either, early to bed early to rise for your 6am game drive! Finally, I would recommend that the Management try and arrange earlier transfers back to Cape Town, currently if you are on the overnight stay the first transer back to Cape Town leaves at about 1pm this means that you are hanging around after your morning game drive, which finishes at about 830am, if they had a 1030am transfer back to Cape Town this would be perfect, the 1pm transfers means you have lost a half day opportunity for sightseeing etc in Cape Town, surely the management can arrange this earler transfer on a regular basis and then a second and third transfer at 1pm and 2pm for those few people that want to spend a little more time in Aquila. All in all an enjoyable experience, not one we would need to do again, as our thoughts are \"been there, done that\", but for first timers on a safari its probably a \"must do\" whilst in Cape Town or the surrounding area."

On arrival was greeted with a glass of bubbly, a very warm welcome from all staff and then had the most sumptious breakfast...what a buffet! was shown to my chalet, which was really luxurious (the beds are soo comfy, there's airconditioning and a log fire for all weather eventualities). My first game drive was at 5pm, so after unpacking laid by the fantastic pool and got some sun, then another amazing buffet at lunchtime!The game drive was excellent - our driver CJ and ranger Tim were just great...could answer all our questions and clearly love the job they do - they could tell us all about any ot the animals, and made the trip so much fun! We even stopped for a while and had a snack and sparkling wine which was great. Got back in time for shower and another buffet for dinner! Second game drive was at 6am, great to watch the sun rise and appreciate the amazing views - wow.I would recommend this to anyone,,,,such friendly and accomodating staff, the food really has to be seen to be believed (i am a fussy vegetarian, so great praise indeed :-)It was really well organised, and the lodge and grounds are quite beautiful. There were people of all age groups from tiny kids to pensioners, and there is something for everyone.All i can say is ...don't miss it!"

From the moment I arrived to the moment I left I thoroughly enjoyed the visit. Accommodation was great, food was delicious, the staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgable. It was incredible seeing all the animals in person. This is not a zoo as some reviewers claim. However it was my first experience at a game reserve, perhaps if you have been to some of the bigger ones you would consider 4,500 hectares too small to be interesting. However for people who have never been to a game reserve and want to go somewhere close to Cape Town I highly recommend that you do the overnight stay at Aquila. It was an amazing and memorable experience for me."

            "review": "Disgusting Zoo!!! WHAT A SHAM TO CALL IT A NATURE RESERVE!!!!. On our recent visit to Aquila Private Game Reserve in the Western Cape, we were shocked to observe the following;During our mealtimes we saw rats running all over the Bar and Restaurant as well as birds flying into the restaurant soiling on the food, tables and chairs that we as guests have to eat on. This is completely unacceptable. In my opinion this is NOT a 4 star Lodge as they would like to advertise.There also seems to be an unbearable stinge coming from the Kitchen and that could only be from poor Hygiene levels and disgusting rubbish bins which in turns explains the huge fly problem that there is. We also noticed the flies sitting on the Buffet and a cheese display that was already sweating and not even being put on an ice-tray or being covered with a fly net. Not to mention the dirty black pots and miniature Cole stoves that they use to keep the food warm! Just outside the dining room there are facilities for Ladies and Gents of which the latter can\u2019t be flushed due to a water problem. How hygienic is this practice having toilets outside a dining area and with NO water..??? I happened to enter into the Kitchen one afternoon before Game Drive, for I was looking for a member of staff to assist us, and there I was horrified to say the least..!! Staff smoking inside the kitchen entrance, raw cut up chicken being defrosted in water as well as frozen fish lying on the dirty table tops with flies all over it!! Dirty pots and stove that the staffs are cooking on. Other meats lying in a rubbish bin to de-frost. None of the kitchen staff even had the correct uniforms on, cutlery in crates standing on the floor next to the over full rubbish bins and a sink filled with disgusting dirty water and piles of dirty plates stacked on top of each other not being washed. My wife and I however refrained from eating there fearing for our health, until we left the next afternoon. As far as my knowledge serves me correct a Game lodge or reserve is a place where the animals are free in the wild. At Aquila lodge the elephants are kept in boma\u2019s in the evenings with the elephant herders. The cheetah\u2019s are kept on the opposite side of the road in a \u201cproject\u201d though they don\u2019t have the freedom or space to run as Cheetah are naturally meant to. The leopard and 2 lions are also kept there in an enclosed area. The Rhino are on the reserve with general game, while the other 3 lions are on a separate section of the property. The 4 hippo are in a small dam. The buffalo roam the lodge freely as they are \u201chand reed\u201d. Every single morning the buffalo are roaming around the front of the rooms & are herded away from the guest area then again in the evenings the buffalo are around the rooms. The fencing is pushed over every single day. The Ostrich also roam about the lodge freely not even noticing people walking past them. All these animals are feed via Lucerne, That is NOT how game lodges are. One evening as a game drive came back the tracker then passed the guests & went onto the reserve to go feed the animals the Lucerne and right behind the tracker was a herd of 15 buck following the tracker as they know that it\u2019s feeding time. These animals do not belong naturally in the Karoo, & I feel this is total cruelty to them.Outside our room we ALSO noticed a disgusting smell from the sewerage, which can only be from overfilled sewerage system and now it\u2019s spilling out onto the lawns etc. apart from our room that wasn\u2019t even properly cleaned daily and the 3 Buffalo\u2019s wandering around the rooms. Isn\u2019t this risky to have such dangerous animals in such close proximity of people..?? Is it really necessary to have Cheetah and lions in cages and then calling it a rehab centre..???? Surely the owner and or management can see to it that the Lodge is being kept clean, tidy and presentable or is this enough for them to shamelessly keep making the money that they do..? We will never visit the Reserve again, nor will we encourage anyone else to go there."

It is NOT like a zoo as some people described. The animals live in very large fields and some times it was hard to find them. They are NOT domesticated, the buffalos and rhynos actually chased our jeep. We witnessed a confrontation between the hippopotamus trying to protect their pond from the buffalos and then the rhynos fighting with the buffalos. It was pretty impressive. The lions live in a separate large field, and not enclosed like some people described here. Our ranger, Tammy, was very friendly and knowleageable about the animals. We stayed overnight and took the safari at 5:00PM and then at 6:00AM. I would say that two days is more than enough there. Besides the game drive there is not much to do.I thought the food was good, nothing very fancy, but there were many options in the buffet.For visitors of Cape Town that do not have much time and would like to experience the safari feel, I would most definitely recommend Aquila."

He made the trip rather fun altho I felt the bus could have had a bit of deodorant thru it...We were happy to recieve a glass of champagne upon arrival and a sumptuous buffet spread for breakfast. Nothing fancy but honest wholesome food.I chose to go Horse Riding around the park and my husband went on the Quad Bikes.This proved an excellent choice as I had a guide to myself and there was only one other tourist with my husband. My guide was relatively new and we both had an incredible time viewing all the animals at quite close range. I wonder if he got tired of hearing me go omg omg omg....I had an incredible ride.My husband likewise had wonderful fun on the quads, and we were both able to get a slightly different view of the park than that offered with the jeeps full of whinging tourists (oh yes I heard you all)We came back and my guide offered to take us in a jeep around again to watch the elephants playing in the mud hole - fabulous!! Just me and my husband and two guides to give us a running comentry - we loved it.Came back to a very servicable buffet luncheon had a glass of wine before departing back.We did not expect it to be anything other than what it was - plenty animals wandering around, yes geared towards the tourists but we were happy with our taste of it.Had a great day, wonderful pleasant staff, belly full of decent tucker.We Loved It!!"

Afterwards we had lunch then hung about for a bit before heading back to Cape Town. I think a day would be long enough here - to be honest the food wasn't great and there wasn't much else to do so I say go - see the amazing animals - then leave. I wouldn't like to be booked to stay here for a few days having to eat the buffet food 3 times a day (but I am fussy!!). I can see why some people give negative reviews.. if you have been on a \"real\" safari before then this would probably be a let down. Personally, I have never been on a safari so this was a big step up from Edinburgh zoo for us and we thought it was brilliant! If you're not too fussed about seeing animals then it may not be worth the long drive, but it is great to see them and we got some good pics! If you are only in Cape Town for 1 week and want a safari experience then go for it!!"

Reading some other reviews it seems that people were somehow expecting a full on private wilderness game reserve just out of Cape Town - if this is what you are after don't bother, spend your money on a trip up to the north east. However, if you want to experience the African countryside and see the Big 5 and you are staying in Cape Town this is a great option. A couple of other points to consider:- the rooms were not great, but they are clean and remember you are paying for the upkeep of the park and the animals not 5 star accommodation- the two pools are fantastic although you need to get a spot early expecially once the day trippers start to return from their morning drive. It is worth planning to arrive early and/or leave late to enjoy the facilities rather than rushing back to Cape Town- the meals were buffet style, of which I am not a big fan at all, however, I would rate the food as close to the best buffet food I have had"

We drove to the reserve from Cape Town (2 Hours) and after the intial welcome and high standard buffett breakfast went on a 2-3 hour quad bike safari. We were lucky in that we were the only two people who had booked for the quad bikes so had our own guide for the duration. The guide, Tim, was very articulate and well informed. 10 out of 10 for Tim.We managed to see everything within the time period and felt like we were getting just that little extra for free because it was just the two of us. Most people in the larger vehicles were jealous of the freedom of the quads. A brilliant experience that exceeded all expectations."

It felt as though the animals were placed there for us to drive up and see, and you can see a busy road from most points of the reserve. The lions were in a tiny enclosure (we heard the same story about it only being 'for a few weeks'; but from other reviews its clear its been months, if not more). The cheetah and leopard enclosures were depressingly small, and the crocs looked like they were trying not to invade each other's space in their enclosure. The giraffes were no where to be seen, but there were few trees for them to feed on if they were around; they told us they were 'in the forest'. The ranger offered little information and didn't make himself very available for questions. The rooms felt like motel rooms that had been spruced up to have a safari lodge feel. To add insult to injury, it was our HONEYMOON and they could only offer us two twin beds pushed next to each other. If you want a guaranteed viewing of the big five, then you will find it here, but in our experience, it was an insult to South African safari/game reserves. The scenery is, however, lovely."

Our experience at Aquila was amazing...the reserve was beautiful and although relatively close to Cape Town, we felt we were a wrold apart. Our guide Daniel made the game drive quite interesting and helped us underestand the animals and their habitats. No, this is not a safari, nor is it meant to be. But from what we could observe the animals appeared content in their own natural habitat. At night, you can here the animals as they come into camp and during the day elephants came down to the water hole just outside our room. Plus a babboon or 2 ran past the swimming pool as we relaxed in the sun. Stay the night...this way you participate in the afternoon and monring rides. Quite excellent!"

We opted for the overnight safari so we got there at about 11.30 so that we could chill out an relax by the pool before going on safari. With the overnight package you have two game drives, one at 5pm and the other at 6am (yes you are given a wake up knock on the door by your game driver.) The accommodation is very nice, with the bathroom having a nice big bath and outdoor shower. We went in their summer, but I can imagine that it gets cold there, but the rooms have a fire and hot water bottles are provided. The rest of the lodge is really nice, and you are provided with lunch, dinnner and breakfast. The food is buffet style and there is lots of choice. The safari itself is really good. You are taken out by experienced rangers and you see lots of animals - elephants, rhinos, hippos, lions, giraffes and springbock. The reserve also has a rescue centre which you are taken to on the morning safari. During both safaris you are given drinks and snacks, champagne when for the sunset and hot chocolate for the sun rise. This has given me a good introduction to safaris and can`t wait to do another one!"

We chose to go because we wanted to have a safari experience whilst in South Africa, but did not have the time to do a 'real' safari from Johannesburg.Aquila Game Reserve did not disappoint! It took just over 2 hours to drive from Cape Town through the beautiful Hex River Valley (even saw wild baboons on the side of the road). We arrived early about 11.30am and were given welcome drinks and invited to sit around the lovely pool area until lunch at 12.30. From the outset all of the staff could not do enough for youand we were given plenty of information.After our buffet style lunch - plenty of food, drinks not included - we checked in and were escorted to our cottage. We stayed in the basic room but it was still lovely. The decoration, including bathroom with outdoor shower, was all in keeping with a safari lodge and very comfortable. We enjoyed an afternoon sunbathing and using the pool before our sunset safari at 5pm.We very much enjoyed the 2 hour safari drive - yes it is obvious that you are on a game reserve but we knew that from the beginning. All of the animals looked relaxed and natural and the area is certainly huge. We saw all of the animals except giraffe on our first drive (and found those on our 2 hour sunrise drive the next morning). Our driver was super friendly and really knowledgeable about the animals. We found out lots of interesting information about the specific animals we saw, Aquila Game Reserve's history & future plans and wild animals generally across South Africa. 8-10pm evening dinner was followed by a fire and traditional drums and when we chose to go back to our room we were escorted by a staff member for extra security. For our early morning (5am) drive we were woken by the staff (as requested) and once again enjoyed seeing all of the animals. A comprehensive breakfast (8-10am)followed before we checked out and drove to back to Cape Town.I would certainly recommend Aquila if you want a safari experience close to Cape Town and appreciate friendly staff members and decent food. The experience was completed for us by the rooms, the chance to relax around the pool and the sunset/sunrise drives. I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed it as much had I gone on the day trip."

My partner and I had an overnight stay at Aquila, and as others have said, it's not the Kruger (which many friends who have been say is way too expensive), but a smallish private game reserve, that's what you have to keep in mind!We really enjoyed our stay. I agree about the 'sparkling wine', but i think that's being very negative, we didn't expect Bollinger! The check-in was quick and easy, with very pleasant staff all around.Our room was really nice, and very in keeping (in our opinion) with a game reserve. The bed was huge, the bathroom was very clean with a corner tub inside, and a shower outside. Each room has a patio area overlooking the reserve, where you can sit and enjoy the star lit sky, after a very nice evening meal. The food really was nice, breakfast too. We had no dickie tummies!We had two safaris, one at dusk, and one early in the morning. The dusk one was the best, and we saw all the animals that we expected to, and a few extra! There are now 3 giraffes at the reserve. The lion area is 200 hectares. Stopping for refreshments half way through was a welcome way to mix with other guests, and talk to the other guides who were full of knowledge and information about the reserve and the animals. Our main guide held such a wealth of knowledge about all the animals, and the future plans for the reserve, we learnt so much.The reserve is very new, and is still building up its animal stocks, but this was all explained, they don't try to hide the fact that they are a fledgling reserve. There is building work going on there, but it didn't disrupt our stay at all, there are no cranes, just builders.The owner/manager came round to each table during the evening meal to check that all the guest were happy, and not wanting for anything, this was a really nice personal touch.If you are going for an overnight stay, make sure you are there by 4pm, as the dusk safari starts at 4.30pm. The lack of itinery knowledge was the only let down of the reserve, but we asked for one to be emailed to us in advance. It appreared that some guests missed this because they didn't know what time it started.We feel that this was value for money, and are really glad we took the time to stay overnight during our holiday. If you have the time, take the scenic route one-way, going through the mountains rather than the tunnel (from Cape Town)."

Having been on many safaris throughout Africa this was not what I would call a real safari. The reserve is very small, with the lions in a caged area, and lion cubs born April 08 in an even smaller caged area. Two cheetahs also in a smal caged area for breeding and will be for quite a while by the sounds of it.We took the two day Safari and drove up from Cape Town early in the morning of day one, knowing that we would just spend the day by the pool before our first safari at 5pm. My two daughters aged 7 & 8 enjoyed the pool and just chilling out. Food was excellent but get to the meals early as it runs out!Our first safari was very poor. The driver just rushed around from one animal to the next, and we spent 50 mins standing around drinking whilst out on a 2.5hr safari! What a waste of time! The safari was so poor that when we returned I complained to the manager. The guide said nothing, the driver hardly ever stopped long enough to allow photo's, and I had to ask several times to go back.The second safari was early the next morning. This was so much better as my complaints were obviously received and handled properly. However the problem with Aquila is the reserve is very small and there is only one giraff, two elephants, a few buffallo. No sign of a lepoard, and the cats are all in caged areas. I realise now that in order to see animals in their natural enviroment you need to go to a bigger park where nature can take its course and allow all the animals to live together as they should. There are other smaller animals, and the only plus side were the Rhino's, really nice to see.I would not recommend Aquila to anyone. Save your money and go to a zoo, because that's all this place really is! Pay a little more and have the experience of your life at a much larger private reserve up north in the Timbavati area next to the Kruger. There were three American girls with us who I know felt the same thing.Plus points: Food very good. Accommodation good. Less than two hours from Cape Town.Minus Points: The animals!"

From the web page and literature we were expecting a game reserve that also had a luxury place to stay attached. The game reserve is a bit disappointing but it is what it says. We knew not to expect a real safari, this is the wrong part of the country for that, but it is sad to see a place that has 1 giraffe all on her own and only two elephants. Having said that the rangers are very helpful and knowledgeable and picked up on our likes very well. My main gripe is that this is not a place to stay for luxury. We paid 14000 Rand for a 2 night stay including transport from Cape Town. This is a HUGE amount of money in South Africa. Its 1000 GBP so is hardly a drop in the ocean for two nights in any currency. The transport to the Aquila was a basic minibus which wasa bit run down. In fact I cut my leg on the seat. There was no room for our luggage despite me having told them in advance and confirmed the day before what we had. On arrival we had to hang around for 6 hours before having anything to do or checking into our room. I appreciate that hotels have check in times, but when they have made you get up at 0430 for your transfer to sit around for such a long time is taking the mickey. Food is OK but you get the same meal at lunch and dinner every day it's a basic buffet which is fine as a day tripper but not for 5 meals in 3 days. There is a pool area but this is open to all the day trippers to use as well. When you have 170 daytrippers arriving and approximately 12 sun loungers there isn't much hope for residents to get one. There was building work going on all around the pool area with a new lounge and what looked like more accomodation being built. Very noisy and quite dirty.We had booked the top type of chalet. It was OK but nothing more. We tried to leave a day early but were told here was no transport available.In summary, I would say go to Aquila for the day, see a few animals and get away, it will give you a view of whether you want to do a real safari. My suggestion to the owners is put in a second area for residents to relax in and offer better food (or at least some choice) to residents in the evening, or reduce the pricing. It's all a bit of a rip off really, I came away with the feeling that I had been fleeced which detracts from some lovely experiences with the animals"

There seemed to be confusion amongst the desk staff when we arrived at 2PM and despite presenting our confirmation receipt, we were kept waiting more than 40 minutes after arrival, without explanation other than a ranger would take us to our cabin. After being driven to our cabin (the roads to/fro were a mess) we put away our belongings and inspected the premises. It was soon apparent that our cabin was not the luxury accomodations we had paid for and we had no means of getting to main building or contacting them (our cabin had no phone). We had to wait a few hours before we were picked up for the safari at 5PM. Afterwards, it was explained to us by GM Ian, that there had been a deluge some weeks back that had destroyed several of the cabins and weashed out some of the roads and we did see evidence of this. Ian agreed to compensate us for the price difference between standard and luxury accomodations and he bought us a bottle of wine with dinner that evening.Our package included lunch, which (like dinner) is a buffet-style meal. There was a plently to choose from with entrees, desserts and a salad bar. Any wine or bar had to be paid for separately.The evening safari was terrific - it was a beautiful evening and our ranger-guides were attentive and enthusiastic. We saw many animals and we were very satisfied. Our standard cabin was remotely located within the reserve and we had a very pleasant evening listening to the animals and gazing at the star-studded southern sky. The next morning, our safari ride was 20-minutes late with no explanation given. A short ways into the safari, our vehicle had to turn around to pick up people in the cabin adjacent to ours. We did see animals but our sole ranger-guide (one of the same two from the previous evening) seemed unenthusiastic and fairly quiet. There were not as many animals seen on the morning jaunt and it was shorter.The animals congregate in open areas where feed is strewn about so it is easier to see them. Good idea, but it lacks a genuosity to it. Also, the lions and cheetahs were each separately penned from the other animals(understandably so) but in modest enclosures - there was no feeling that we were seeing the cats in the natural habitat.Aquila was OK and they did deliver on the animals but, I'd suggest that visitors wishing for a safari experience consider taking an extra day or two and travel further east to see something more genuine."

Like some of the people on here, we didn't have time to travel outside Cape Town for a real safari experience but thought that Aquila may have provided us with a taster. We also read about it in the Wallpaper guide, which is normally pretty reliable, and the accommodation looked good. We paid for two nights but left after one. The chalet was nice but we'd really come to see the wildlife and one game drive is enough to do this as they have so few animals. We did two game drives and each game drive was scheduled to last 2 hours but at least 30 minutes of this is spent stopping for drinks - cheap sparkling wine or coffee (in the morning). They have two elephants, one giraffe, 5 rhino and 5 lions. It's faintly depressing - almost feels like somewhere that former circus animals go to retire (which would actually make it worthwhile). They feed the animals so always know when and where to find them so the whole experience feels staged. Althought the scenery is pretty spectacular. The worst part were the pair of cheetahs who are kept in a tiny enclosure - really not much bigger than you would expect to see in a zoo. In summary - not worth the 2 1/2 hour drive from Cape Town and definitely not worth the money they charge to stay (food is average and breakfast was cold). Take other people's advice on here and save up for a real safari. Although may be ideal for families - all the kids on the game drives seemed to love it and you're pretty much guaranteed to be up close to the big 5."

Like the previous review given by another travellor me and my husband travelled 2.5 hours (each way) to Aquila on 18/12/08 for a day safari only to find they were closed due to the flooding. We had received no communication from them. The manager of the reserve, Renier, gave us his mobile number and told us to call him on 25th Nov to check the park would be re-open for us to go on Safari the following week. We phoned Renier on Tuesday and re-arranged a day safari for Thursday 27th November 2008.Once again we travelled 2.5 hours (each way) to Aquila only to find the reserve was still closed. Once again we had received no communication of this.We, like the previous reviewer were told that we would be contacted and compensated. On our return from holiday we contacted Aquila to log a complaint. Our complaint has not been dealt with to our satisfaction so we are now taking our complaint through the tourism board.Although we have not seen the full facilities of Aquila if the organisation of the park is anything like the administration and co-ordination of the bookings I would give this one a miss."

I can't comment on the actual reserve, because we never got to see it - apart from the scruffy entrance area and a glimpse of the unimpressive looking accommodation compound. But I can say something (negative, I'm afraid) about their organisation and communication.When we arrived in Cape Town, 10 days before we were due to visit Aquila, we saw there had been flooding in the Touwsrivier area. We immediately contacted them and were told that, because a lot of their people had been affected by the flooding, the reserve would be closed for a few days, but re-opened in plenty of time for our arrival. So we were somewhat surprised to get there (after a half day journey out of our way) to find it was still closed. Apparently roads and bridges on the reserve had been damaged and still couldn't be used. Which is OK - these things happen - but some forewarning should have been given. Even 24 hours' notice would have allowed us to make alternative plans and accommodation arrangements. We were told we would be getting a full explanation and apology from customer service. But we haven't heard a word. However, judging by the other reviews, we may have been saved from an expensive disappointment."

We were expecting a more lush landscape. It is very barren and rocky. A welcome drink was provided, although we had no time for it because we were rushed through to breakfast. It was terrible. The dining room was over-crowded and no-one told us where to sit. We were moved from 2 tables because they had been allocated to guests who were staying. A total shambles. Queues for food were too long and we managed to gulp down a cold slice of toast before being herded into masses of vehicles waiting outside. On a good point - our guide \"Timothy\" was absolutely excellent and extremely knowledgeable. We did indeed see the Big 5, however, it felt like a zoo. Only 1 giraffe, 2 elephants, 3 rhino, 2 hippo, a few buffalo and some springbok. The lions are kept in a separate fenced off area and I think there were about 3 or 4. It felt rather like being on the Safari Ride at Disney's Animal Kingdon in Florida. Lunch was served which was of very good quality, but forget using the pool to \"relax\" afterwards. It is tiny and the place is absolutely teeming with guests - both day and overnight. All in all the day was rather disappointing. Yes you can say you did a safari in Africa, but I would much rather see the animals acting naturally and fending for themselves. This place needs LOADS more animals to start to feel like a true Game Reserve. It was all rather too staged for my liking."

We were picked up in cape town from our hotel around 6.30am and taken to Aquila - the journey was great with lovely scenery. Even in mid September there was still snow ont he hills and when we arrived at Aquila it was extremely cold and windy. We had breakfast on arrival which was good and then shown to our chalets/lodge. This had an open fire which on first glance looked great. the chalet was on two levels and there were enough beds for 6-8 people in three different rooms. However, the windows and doors do not close properly, no double glazing and with the wind coming directly onto the front of the chalet it was absolutely freezing. We had to use the rear bedroom, keep doors closed and have the heating on full blast.Our first safari was not until very late afternoon and there is absolutely nothing to do at Aquila for the time from breakfast to late pm (apart from lunch). this made it quite boring - Aquila could have had other things on - lectures, videos - anything to keep tourists occupied. it would be fine in the summer when you could laze around the pool but we felt the first day was a complete waste of time and money.The two safari trips we went on were good - it is a small reserve but we saw lots of animals - lions, zebra, sprinbok, hipps (and a baby) , rinos (and baby), ostriches, eland, giraffe, cheetahs, birds etc. The rangers were informative and answered all queries - we were provided with hot or cold drinks on each safari and had plenty of opportunities for photos.Luckily on the second morning after a safari and breakfast our transport arrived early and we made our way back to Cape Town. Otherwise it would have been another boring day.Certainly a very interesting place but not for an overnight stay. if you do this - take a large book with you."

Aquila pretty much purchased a large plot of cheap land which is largely unsuitable for most animals, seasonally very cold and hot, with desert like shrubs and little tree cover. It is no wonder why many of the animals cannot breed successfully in captivity. Many animals are fed each day much like a farm feeds its animals. The food was very tasty at least...."

            "review": "Over-rated Tourist Trap. We organised a group of four of us to visit Aquila as it was recommended by a friend. It was a very disappointing experience and a real tourist trap without the quality or customer service.I was already wary before I arrived, due to issues with payment for the day safari. I had paid upfront, but had to send numerous emails to get confirmation from Aquila that payment had been received. Eventually I got a rude email back, berating me for not being clearer with my details as it had caused the person dealing with my query to spend lots of time trying to find my details.Another member of our party had problems with her payment, as she had been charged a deposit and had received a receipt from Aquila stating that the deposit had been charged and what the balance was. However on the day we arrived, she was told she had to \u2018prove\u2019 that the deposit had been taken by Aquila.As she pointed out to the receptionist \u2013 Aquila had issued the receipt saying that the deposit had been taken.Eventually this was sorted out and we headed to our breakfast. There was a lot of food on offer, including a full cooked English breakfast, continental meats, toast and cereals. The meats though were on a big table and not refrigerated and the breakfast area was not air-conditioned, so I wasn\u2019t game to try it.Aquila\u2019s marketing is very good \u2013 there were a lot of people there for day trips. This meant that when we headed out on our day safari, that there were four vehicles packed with people. The vehicles have bench seats, and this means that they try to pack in as many people as possible. We had four to a bench, which leaves you very cramped for a three hour game drive!We headed out \u2018convoy\u2019 style with the other vehicles, so you don\u2019t really get to feel like you\u2019re on a safari, more a Jurassic Park style ride. There aren\u2019t that many animals on offer and the guide tries to fill the time (it is a three hour safari after all) with details of the birds on the lagoon, beetles (15mins on a black beetle!) and analysis of poop.The landscape at Aquila is quite flat in parts, and so isn\u2019t that interesting, but they take the convoy up to the highest point of the reserve and you have sparkling wine or grape juice. They have giraffe\u2019s, which are the smaller southern giraffe and they like to stick to the hills. A couple of juvenile (10 & 11 yr) old elephants, a family of Rhino (good photo opportunities, as they put out lucerne near the lake and this entices them out), lions in a caged area (bored looking), buffalo, zebra, hippo, springboks plus other various antelopes.For the cost, Aquila does not represent value for money. I know that some posters have said that it\u2019s closest to Cape Town (2 \u00bc hrs from CT along the N1 & R46 to Ceres if you drive) but having been to other game reserves slightly further out (1/2 hr further) they represented better value for money and you get to see more game.I cannot stress enough just how packed this place was with day trippers! It was like Butlins.I suggest you save your money and do more research for a better place to stay/visit which might be a little bit further out or visit a game lodge along the N2 Garden Route."

I had read a lot of articles about Aquila so I knew exactly what to expect. Realistically, it probably would never compare to Kruger, but if you have limited time and want to experience wildlife near Cape Town, it can't be beaten. We found the staff at Aquila excellent. The Park rangers/guides were very knowledgeable, friendly and good fun. They gave us lots of interesting facts and kept the game drives fun and interesting, even when some of the animals were hiding from the cold mornings. Bar and restaurant staff were also very friendly, and we were pleasantly surprised by the excellent service we received. The food was to a pretty good standard, and due to the fact that all meals were buffets, we had a chance to try various different local dishes each day. We had the standard accommodation, which didn't look great from the outside, but inside it was cosy, clean and pretty much what we expected. My wife was concerned about creepy crawlies, but apart from 1 or 2 small flies, it was fine. On the game drives, you are obviously aware that there isn't a vast amount of animals, but we got very close to rhino's, elephants, and all of the animals (except the illusive leopard).Overall I would say it was a very enjoyable stay, as long as you do enough research so that you know what to expect, you'll enjoy it too. It seems obvious to me that anyone who has given this place a bad review did not research before hand and obviously wanted to sleep in luxury but have a \"real\" safari experience, which is not possible close to Cape Town. Also, Aquila is a relatively new reserve, and I think in 10 or 15 years when it has had chance to mature and add more animals, it will be an amazing experience.I would recommend the Quad Bike and Horse-back safari's, they were great fun, and a chance to get even closer to the animals than you do on the standard game drive."

The reason for the visit was for our four year old grandson to see animals in the 'wild' and not caged in a zoo. We were aware before we went that this would be a 'canned' safari and touristy. This met our expectations. The annoying aspect (which we complained about vocally and in writing) was that the garden and swimming pool was taken over by a film crew and not accessible to hotel guests - as the temperature was in the mid 30's this was not appreciated.The accommodation was acceptable but a good maintenance programme is needed (again the written complaint). Food very similar to a four star package holiday hotel.If you have young children or have a very limited time in South Africa then this is the place to visit - bearing in mind this is NOT the real experience. Our grandson loved the stay!"

            "review": "poor organisation and not a good experience. I stayed for 2 nights here and wish I had spent my time (and money) elsewhere.We arrived in the late afternoon after the 5pm safari drive and were taken to our chalet which was more Mexican looking than African by the manager , the door was hanging off the hinges and required you to lift the door to open/close and lock it- we were assured it would be fixed the next day - it never was and as the paint on the floor had been rubbed off it showed the door had been like this for a long time. Looking around the room it was ok on initial inspection but a closer look revealed quite a few problems. The bath had a tide mark from the last occupants, the string curtains were stained and un ravelling and the string trail had just been wound into a ball , old used toiletries left in the bath and shower area and no toilet brush.NOTE: there is not a picture of the normal chalets on the aquila website and all you see are the luxury chalets that are located just outside the restaurant /main area.We went for dinner ( self service) and the food was traditional Afrikaans which is fine, they had a wide selection of items to suit most people. I noted one of the desserts was ice cream but it was just on a plate so after about 45 minutes it had turned to liquid - tough luck if you like ice cream! We ordered a large bottle of water but that turned out to be R25 very expensive and all drinks are extra at highly inflated prices. We did note however a fruit juice machine on the main table and this was free. We went to our chalet but were woken up by the game rangers parking outside our chalet , slamming the doors etc and making lots of noise - it seems they also sleep in the chalets, I didn't need to bother setting my alarm as I was woken again in the morning by the same rangers beeping the horn of the vehicle and lots of door slamming.Before the 6am \"safari drive\" we asked at reception where shall we meet and were told at the front of the reception, and to just join any vehicle, this we did and people dispersed onto various vehicles, it then appeared there were not enough seats for all the people so instead of just taking another vehicle we waited for about 15 mins whilst they came up with a plan - a lady decided not to go on the game drive and went back to her chalet as there was not enough room for her. We found out the guests are allocated into groups for the vehicles and we were meant to be on another vehicle but that was also full so the problem would have still existed!The drive in the morning was about 2.5 hours but over a small area, we saw a lot of animals but I noticed most were waiting in feeding areas - the animals are fed at specific areas along the game drive route so it ensures you will see them. Our game ranger/guide appeared very bored and gave some very limited info throughout the drive.The lions are in a separate area, not a cage as some reviews suggest but in a fenced off area so you will see them.We returned to the reception area after the game drive feeling quite disappointed , we had a look at the various facilities the main area had to offer and were not impressed by any means - leaking toilets and quite a few were dirty due to the lack of toilet brushes but this was about 0830 in the morning so I can only assume the toilets had not been cleaned.When back at the chalet I found lots of old cigarette butts and old milk packets in the chalet seating area and the 1 chair we had was falling apart. There is not much to do during the day time unless you pay extra to go on a quad bike or horse drive but you just follow the same sort of pattern as the normal game drives and see the same animals so its nothing new really.We went on the 5pm game drive and this time asked where we were meant to be, having found our group we went for the drive, this time the ranger/guide was really good, appeared to have a genuine interest and had lots of info, but again the drive was in the same small area and we saw all the same animals, 2 elephants, 2 giraffes, few ostriches, few rhinos, buffalo etc get a bit boring after seeing them a few times on the same drive. We stopped for a while and were given cheap sparkling wine and grape juice along with a selection of some fruit and a packet of marshmallows????!! The evening meal was different from the night before but this time the service was very bad, we had to clear our own table between courses, the fruit juice machine was not there and after asking the waitress she said it was broken ( this appeared to to be the standard answer to most questions if something was missing) but nothing was offered as an alternative which was very bad, not even cold tap water was available - warm tap water was!During our meal we overheard many another couples complaining about various items and none were impressed with the facilities or the service.we decided to skip the 6am game drive as we had seen all the animals the park had to offer and the drive was along the same routes we had already been on.I filled out the \"guest satisfaction\" survey in the welcome pack with similar comments and gave it to the receptionist and mentioned we were not happy, she wasnt listening or looking at us and just said \"ok thanks.\" I didnt bother saying any more as it was obvious it was a waste of timeIf you are on holiday, have the extra cash to spend and have never seen any wild animals before then I suppose it is ok , you can also do a day visit from CT but read other reviews on that!!! I would not spend more than 1 night there as the routine is the same each day. Based on my personal observations Aquila is in reality a 3* resort and no where near the 4* plaque from the tourist board The concept at Aquila is a good one but the facilities and organisation needs to be greatly improved.For similar costs visit Shamwari near Port Elizbeth and go to a real game reserve that has received many awards."

If you are truly interested in seeing wild animals in their natural environment then you're better off elsewhere. Aquila offer a canned experience as they feed their \"wild\" animals and it's a marketing ploy that the service offered is great or that the accomodation is luxurious. It is very expensive for what is on offer. Since they market specifically to young families note that child minders (ie housekeeping staff) will take your (crying) toddlers to watch them fold linen in a hot dingy laundry when you use their services!We are seasoned luxury game lodge visitors so know what to expect. This is where Aquila fell short:1) we did not get what we booked for, nor could it be rectified both before the time or once we arrived2) the accommodation was so cramped we could barely move around and furnishings were extremely basic (some was actually removed to seat day trippers leaving us without chairs)3) game drive offerings are mean - dodgy cheap sparkling wine is the best thing on offer4) food is okay, but choices are very limited and all drinks etc are extra's so it's expensive 5) babysitting services offered are a joke (see above)On the plus side, it is close to Cape Town (therefore obviously convenient and malaria free) and their guides are knowledgeable (wouldn't you be about 2 giraffe, lions in an enclosure, 2 elephants, 3 rhino's, a few hippo etc?). You can be pretty sure you'll see some big game (as the reserve area is small, and animals come to be fed before drives!!!!!!!) so taking kids is viable (they won't get bored) but you will be left feeling ripped off. I'd only recommend this place to those not interested in a real safari experience, or those with limited options. Rather pay a bit more and go to Bushmanskloof, Shamwari or elsewhere for the REAL THING."

We were keen to go to a game reserve and as we were in the Western Cape Aquila Game Reserve was near and sounded very appealing, luxurious even, so we went ahead and booked it.Aquila is only just set off a farily busy road, so the 'ideal view' of animals was infact a road with lorries passing by. Our welcome was less than friendly and as we discovered on our arrival not as luxurious as we had expected for an expensive overnight stay and safari. I did forget to mention by the way, we booked our safari before we left the uk. Luckily we were able to check our email and were shocked to discover that Aquilia had double booked our accommodation, had we not been in south africa for a month we would not have been able to reschedule. Also the web site was out of date for the season, so double check arrival times and times of the safaries.Our first safari was at 6pm, make sure you go to the loo before you leave as its a three hour drive. We were very unlucky as the weather was dreadful, very cold, wet and windy. Our guide drove us around and we saw quite a few of the animals, we stopped for the luxury break, and were served hot chocolate, sparkling wine and the lovely snacks we were expecting were a packet of marshmellows, sweets and some billtong. NOT luxurious in any way! The lions are kept in fenced enclosures and do not run free, but we did see giaraffe up very close.The food was also very ordinary, again it was advertised as top quality and all wine was charged on top so beware it was expensive.We had torrential rain during the night and in the morning we had water running down our not so luxury accommodation, when we reported it we were just told 'the couple next door had the same problem'!!After our return to cape town we wrote a long letter to Aquila, hoping for a reply we waited and waited and waited. Absolutely nothing. If i were to describle Aquila, i would say it is an over rated tourist trap, you are taken advantage of as most people go for only a day or over night stay so most people would probably not bother to complain. I would save your cash and spend it on a proper safari, just do a lot of research."

Now that I have reread the reviews I can say that in conclusion that they are very reliable!I would like to add that the marketing of Aquila as Cape Town's only Big 5 safari is misleading! This is a man-made safari and as such I think it was overpriced for what we got. But like others who made the trip to Aquila, I was visiting only the Cape Town area and had my heart set on an African safari and was willing to compromise because we had limited time and were also traveling with children. The grounds were indeed beautiful as was the drive to the location. Lunch in the beautiful African-designed dining room was great, but dinner and breakfast were mediocre.The guide Claire was terrific, and the vehicles were very safe. We went looking for the many animals on the reserve which turned out to be a few of each type: two giraffe, 5 buffalo, 2 rhinos, 3 hippos, 14 zebra and 7 lions and one elephant. This being the case I don't think this should have been marketed as a safari! The animals were beautiful when viewed up close and in a natural African landscape.My main qualm was with the accommodations. It was marketed as family luxury. At the price we paid I did not think we would be roughing it. There was no AC and no screens on the windows. That meant a night with little air to breath and lots of bugs that had crawled in. The children's loft was totally suffocated so we ended up sharing a 140 cm bed with him after he threw up in the middle of the night. We were so ready to leave in the morning that we didn't bother trying to complain. In conclusion, I would recommend going for the cheaper day trip to Aquila and skipping the overnight."

Aquila is a newish reserve so doesn't have many animals as such. the lions are kept seperate in a cage because they would kill all other animals. the cheetahs are hand reared so they are tame and u can pet them. The accommodation is clean and a bit rough and ready but overall not bad. Thought the food was great and the 2 bars are also fine. The tour guide, Colin, was a gentleman and seemed very knowledgable.Our main problem was that we had no car so had to use the transfer service. We were collected from our hotel in cape Town at 6am and arrived in Aquila at 8am to be told our first game drive of 2 would be at 5pm. We were then told that our accommodation was not ready and it didn't become available until 11.30am, so we were left sitting with our bags for 3 and a half hours. It was a long day waiting until 5pm for the drive. The next day we had an early start (6am) and saw more animals and had a fine breakfast, but all this was over by 9am and the transfer back to the city doesn't leave until 2pm so again there is more waiting around with bags.The reserve has a bit of an artificial feel about it but is a good way to get up close with the animals."

They have about 100 zebras, a few lions, two elephants, two giraffe, a few hippos and a few rhinos, among other types of animals. Since we were going with a very young child, it felt like a good alternative to a longer, \"proper\" safari. You can see all that's relevant at Aquila in their two hour tour. The tour guide was knowledgeable and told us that she could stop the jeep whenever we wanted to take photos. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Aquila also had scrumptious Western-style breakfast and lunch buffets (go hungry!), which were included with the price of the safari (except drinks aren't included at lunch). The only thing about the safari (we went in August, during South Africa's winter) was that it was very chilly -- so wear a sweatshirt and jeans if you go during that time. There is one portion of the safari where you hike for a minute uphill to see a bushman painting on a rock, so sneakers or flat shoes would also be advisable. If you want to bring a bag, there is plenty of room on the jeep floor. At the end of the safari, they bring you to the cheetah enclosure and you can pet them!"

            "review": "Grrreat trip from Cape Town!. My partner and I actually stayed here in Feb 06, but as I was browsing through trip advisor, I noticed that there are not many reviews of this property and as we had such an enjoyable time I thought I would share my comments!During a 10 day holiday to Cape Town we came across a brochure on Aquila. As there is so much to see and do in Cape Town we had not pre planned any outside trips but decided on the spur of the moment to call and book a 1 night stay. Neither of us had ever been on a Safari and it was not feasable for us to link our Cape Town trip with somewhere like Kruger, partly due to time, (We were visiting family), and partly due to cost. So this seemed like a good alternative and a good oppurtunity to see more of the Western Cape.I called to check availability literally the day before we wanted to go. Initially I was advised that they were fully booked but would check if there was anything they could do. We were coming to the end of our holiday, so didn't have a lot of flexibility, especially as we wanted to celebrate valentines day in Cobbs, (our favourite restaurant in Scarborough).As promised we received a call back later that day to say that they would be able to squeeze us in, we were delighted!After a very scenic 2 hour drive we arrived at Aquila, were warmly greeted with welcome drinks and shown around the grounds which were very well kept. We drove our car to the door of our room, which was very nicely furnished, spotlessly clean, with an indoor bathroom and outdoor shower.While bringing our luggage in, we were followed by an over friendly osterich who decided to set up camp on our terrace and wait for us to come out!. I had never been so close to one before and didn't actually realise how big they are! We went on a sunset safari trip to get our first glimpse of the animals! The staff are fantastic, very knowledgeable and have a wonderful sense of humour. They really had a personal touch in making sure everyone was well looked after and really explained in depth the history behind Aquila and the areas of the grounds that we passed through.Considering that we were well aware that this was a very new reserve, we were pleasantly surprised at how natural the animals looked in their new found habitat. It was explained to us that all the different types of animals that had been brought to the reserve would years ago have been there naturally anyway.We paused for a sparkling wine and nibbles break at sunset, which was very enjoyable and a great oppurtunity to take some pictures and admire the stunning scenery.All meals are served buffet style here and they were fantastic. Very fresh, excellent variety, mainly with Cape Malay influence, all very tasty and a nice selection of desserts.After a very comfortable nights sleep, we were up before sunrise to go on our next safari tour. This really was a wonderful experience and I have included as many pictures as possible. Unfortunately we did not have a great camera at the time, as you will see :)After a delicious breakfast we lounged around the swimming pool, which also has a nice little bar nearby. We had photos taken with the Cheetah Cubs and admired the fake looking but very real crocs pretending to be asleep in their own pool (near the restaurant).We stayed for lunch (also included in the package) relaxed a bit more and then took a leisurely drive back to Cape Town.All in all a very enjoyable stay and we felt a value for money worthwhile experience! I probably would not recommend this for people who have been on Safaris before as I'm sure this is not \"the real thing\" but as a short trip from Cape Town it is well worth doing!"

I worked with Madelaine for weeks ahead of my visit to make sure we would make the most of our trip! She selected the perfect tour guides for each of our days, give us a well rounded and amazing experience! Cape Point TourOur group of three had Richard for the Cape Point Tour, he was extremely knowledgeable and gave us the background. He was flexible with our schedule and was able to get us to all the stops. He even humored us when we wanted to stop to see the wildlife. Cape Winelands TourGavin was an awesome guide for our Winelands Tour, he selected wineries catering to our party of two's extremely polar opposite palettes! Despite a rainy day, we enjoyed everything the Cape Winelands had to offer and had an amazing delectable day! Horseback Riding/Kayaking Even though our excursion to kayak with the penguins was cancelled, Carl took us horseback riding on the beach. Like both Richard and Gavin, he gave us educational commentary of Cape Town and made suggestions on how to best make the most of the remaining time on our holiday. All three of our tour guides were AWESOME They each provided a unique perspective and gave us a well rounded view of the wonderful things Cape Town has to offer as well as a sneak peek at life in the Mother City. I highly recommend PG Tops and their guides - they are a must when traveling to Cape Town. I will be sure to use them again if I am ever back in Cape Town!!"

Provia even squeezed in a visit to an Ostrich farm that my mom wanted to visit. Provia was wonderful on our 2nd day when we last minute switched from the Hermanus day trip to a Wine tour. This trip was on the last day of our trip, and was the first time in 4 days that Table Mountain was open, so she stopped at Table Mountain for us on the way to wine country. Her flexibility was amazing! We would definitely recommend Provia and PG Tops for any Cape Town tours!"

She was aware of my mobility issues and took that.into consideration. She assigned a guide named Jamie, who is truly amazing. We are getting along like long lost family. She is so patient with me because of my walking problems and my use of a walker. She is extremely knowledgable and personable. One day they asked if I would mind them sending a trainee with us to the vineyards. It was fine with me ( the more the merrier ). Imogen came along. She was previously a ranger and decided to become a tour guide. She was also extremely knowledgable and personable. She will be an awesome tour guide when her training is finished.

Since we had never been there before, we felt that using a tour company to ensure that we made the best use of our time was a good idea. Yes it was! We booked 2 full days with PG Tops and one half day, to the Langa Township, which I will review separately. Our guide for the two full days was Provia. On our first full day we traveled to Cape Point. On the second day, she took us to the wineries. The drive to Cape Point was beautiful as we drove along the coast. Even though we had a few showers as we drove, every time we got out of the van the skies cleared and the views were amazing. We visited Cape Point, the Lighthouse and on the way back to Cape Town stopped at Boulders Beach to see the Penguin colony and passed through Simon's Town. On our second day with Provia, she helped us customize our tour. I had been encouraged to visit Franschoeck and we wanted to have something other than only wineries for our kids, ages 17 & 11. Provia organized a day where we visited a Lion Refuge, stopped to tour Franschoek and visited two wineries. The Lion Rescue Park has rescued lions from zoos and the circus and cares for the mistreated and injured animals. The pens for the lions were huge, each lion's history was posted so that we could understand how they came to the refuge. Franschoek was a quaint town with a lot of arts, restaurants and beautiful architecture. We visited our first winery in Paarl, Fairview Winery, and then traveled to Stellenbosch for lunch. After lunch we visited Ernie Els Winery in Stellenbosh Central. It was a beautiful 2 days of touring the Cape Town countryside. Having a tour company that was willing to customize and accommodate our interests as well as provide suggestions we were not aware of, greatly enhanced our appreciation and enjoyment of our visit."

We did the Cape Town City tour, wine land tour, whale watching tour as well as the Cape Peninsula tour with PG Tops- we had no regrets choosing them.At the airport, Merryl was there waiting patiently for us and brought us promptly to the hotel to get our holiday started.As my dad could get a little grumpy, Merryl had been absolutely patient and kind throughout the trip and was really thoughtful. Apart from being a totally safe driver, she is also very knowledgable on the different subjects including geography, history, botany as well as wines! She just has so many ideas and thoughts!If you are looking for just a driver, you could probably get one easily. BUT to get a safe driver AND a guide who could talk about almost any subject with confidence, it would be a rarity. Merryl is one such gem in the hospitality industry in Cape Town.Indeed, I find most organised tours to be rushed, and not attentive to needs of less abled passengers, and in most cases, boring to say the least. I find my private tour to be totally relaxing, flexible, and thoroughly interesting. I would give a high recommendation for PG Tops and Merryl if you are planning your trip to Cape Town."

            "review": "Two great days with PG Tops!. Late in our trip planning, we decided we didn't want to rent a car in Cape Town and opted instead to hire PG Tops to get us out and about. It was a good decision, much more relaxing and with the added value of the historical and cultural perspective the guides could provide. Oriane in the PG Tops office was super to work with - very helpful and responsive.Our first day out with PG Tops was a private tour of the Cape Peninsula with Carel. Carel was great - very knowledgeable and personable. He managed to side-step any potential crowds, affording us largely unobstructed views and overall a more personal experience. He also has eagle eyes and was able to show us wildlife along the way, including shy eland camouflaged in the bush. He is also an avid scuba diver and shared a lot of his local knowledge re: dive sights, etc. Since we are not divers ourselves, this was only of passing interest.Our second day out with PG Tops was a trip to Cape Winelands with Sarina and Mike. Both were lovely and set a nice pace for the day (Sarina as the guide and Mike in training). Since we were planning to be dropped off in Franschhoek at the end of the tour, our goal was to get an overview of Cape Winelands enroute. We made stops in Stellenbosch (The Spice Route), Paarl (Lanzerac), and Franschhoek (Boschendall and Grande Provence). We had a tasty and beautiful lunch at Boschendall Winery overlooking the kitchen gardens. Our only regret is that it really was a large, heavy meal, and we would've been happier doing something less formal.Overall, we would highly recommend PG Tops. They are very professional and friendly, their automobiles are comfortable and well maintained, and they have put great thought into their itineraries."

We had a 6-day private escorted tour organised by Bianca at PG Tops for our family of two adults and three teenage children, taking us from Cape Town to Addo Elephant Park. It was our first visit to South Africa and Jarred Vosges our PG Tops tour guide was extremely knowledgeable about everything South Africa, and I mean everything! He made the whole trip and we are forever grateful. We could not have asked for more! As first time visitors we were a little apprehensive but we really had no need to be. South Africa is a beautiful country and so are the people. I won\u2019t bore you with the finer details of our holiday, but all I will say is 'visit South Africa!' You will not be disappointed.Chris SmithChristchurch, UK."

He is extremely knowledgable, but just as important, was a delight to spend two days with: flexible, great sense of humor, provided tons of info but never seemed to be lecturing us; gave us plenty of time to visit, relax and learn. We all (2 couples traveling together) encouraged Jarrod to come visit us in California if he ever can; we'd love to see him again and repay his hospitality. And the folks at PG Tops (Sarina in particular) were easy to deal with and made no mistakes in our arrangements at all.Highest possible recommendation for PG Tops and Jarrod!"

In addition to the Cape of Good Hope and the Penguins we wanted to stop at Haut Bay and see the seals. He was very informative and made several stops along our drive to the Cape to let us take pictures. We saw and learned so much that day. I would highly recommend a private tour.

She booked us with Leslie, since we are a younger group, and he was awesome! He was so flexible, personable and a delight. He really catered to our every need as we dove with sharks, visited Table Mountain & Cape Point (even going to \"rescue\" the 5 in our group who thought hiking up Table Mountain was a good idea) and went touring in the Winelands. He totally understood us and took us to great, local spots for meals and showed us more than we would have thought to ask for. He somehow managed to corral the 8 of us rambunctious ladies so we didn't miss anything we wanted to do, which was definitely a challenge. We wouldn't have had nearly as fantastic or fun a time without him. Highly recommend!"

I was in South Africa for 2 weeks with my friends. We stayed in Cape Town for 4 days. Prior coming to CPT, I arranged our trip with Sofie and she was so amazing and easy to communicate with. When we arrived to the airport, we were a little late, but our tour guide Richard was waiting for us patiently. He had such beautiful and sincere smile. Richard was so friendly and very informative. He gave us the full history about Langa Township and told us about what to expect when were in town- drove us around the town and even made us walk around the town and interact with the locals/residents. That was the best part of the trip- the best way to understand the culture and the lives of some of South Africans!! The next day, we went Geoffrey. Geoffrey was funny and pleasant to be around. He was full of personality, we ran around the city with him on our way to the boat ride to Robben Island (it was a good exercise, we needed it haha). But before that he also took us around the city (we saw beautiful colorful houses/mosques). Table Mountain was closed that day so we were not able to make it with him, but Jarred who also worked PG Tops took us few days later. Jarred was also as amazing as Richard and Geoffrey. He was so flexible. We told him that we did not want to go to Wineland tour and instead we asked him to around the city and market. He did it without any hesitation. Honestly, PG Tops and its staff couldn\u2019t be better."

Our first day included a Table Mountain tour and then a city tour, all accompanied by Yolanda's great knowledge of the history of Cape Town and the country. We parted company after about 6 hours, in time to catch the ferry to Robben Island.The following day, as Yolanda was away, we had a different guide, Leslie, a very personable and knowledgeable young man who drove us to Cape Point, and all the points in between such at Simonstown, Camps Bay , Kalk Bay, the penguin colony etc., all the while keeping us informed about the history of the area. Leslie also accompanied us on a tour of the Winelands the following day, with stops at three wineries, each of which had a distinct personality. That, plus Leslie's knowledge of the wines, made the trip very interesting. We had lunch in Franschoek and then made our way back to Cape Town.All in all, the arrangements we made with PG Tops worked out extremely well, and were flexible enough to allow for changes if there was something we preferred to eliminate or add."

Most importantly, he can also locate the best ice cream along the route.If you have an allergy to the buses, a private tour with PG Tops - Gavin, specifically - is worth it!"

It is an excellent way to understand the culture and history of Cape Town, as well as experience the way many local Cape Town residents live each day. Our tour guide lives in Langa, and knew people at each of the stops on the Township Tour, which made the tour feel extremely authentic. He was also extremely knowledgable, and answered all of our questions. We had so much fun!"

            "review": "PG Tops helped us make the most of our Cape Town visit. With just a single day to see the out-of-town sights after a visit to Cape Town, my choice of tour guide for my group of friends was important. With help from TripAdvisor, I reached out to a handful of tour companies. Only two responded with interest in providing us a custom, private tour. The first was PG Tops. The second was fully booked, and referred us to... PG Tops.Over a handful of emails, I shared our priorities (the penguins at Boulders Beach and Cape Point), and left the rest to the team there. They made it easy for me to share information with my friends, they communicated effectively (all via email, as I wanted) as we planned the trip. They paid attention to everything going on -- from the Two Oceans Marathon, with road closures they anticipated and planned around, to weather.Carel picked us up at our hotel on schedule. The van he drove us around in all day was comfortable. He was a font of knowledge, about everything in the area. He took us to great look out (read: photo op) points all throughout the day. He got us to Boulders before any other humans showed up, allowing us to spend some quality time with the penguins who hung out on the beaches outside the protected colony. He found several great spots on the way to Cape Point to experience the landscape, the views, and even the intense wind.We all appreciated his flexibility, too. One of my friends had to head back to Cape Town to catch a flight while the rest of us stayed behind, and the team at PG Tops planned it advance and Carel executed perfectly, planning a lunch for us while he met the airport transfer with our friend.It was a whirlwind day, and thanks to Carel and PG Tops, we got to see and do everything we wanted -- and more. That day was a perfect end to our visit to Cape Town. I would definitely call them again for Cape tours. The price was fair, the hospitality was excellent, and everything worked exactly as promised! Thank you so much!"

We had a wonderful day in a stunningly beautiful place. Highly recommend this drive and visit. Carel was so informative and he felt like a friend as we toured this wonderful place. He and the company are highly reliable and dependable. And the price was right too. Highly recommend both PG TOPS and Carel."

Madelaine was very helpful in organising the tours. On first day our guide was Godfrey ( a.k.a.God if Table mountain clear on day of visit !! - It Was !!! ) Very knowledgeable and passionate about his township. Went on a city tour, district 6 museum, Table Top Mountain via revolving gondola, and finished with the highlight - A tour of Langa township. So much to take in and made memorable with Godfrey's knowledge and insight to the area.Second tour was with Deon and the Cape Peninsular. Very knowledgeable about area and included penguin colony, funicular railway up to lighthouse. A windy warm day where we saw ostriches and baboons as well.Third day was also with Deon. This time it was the wine district tour without the wineries - This amused Deon. We went to Cheetah sanctuary which was a definite highlight to see work with cheetahs plus opportunity to stroke one, Followed by tour of district and brief stops at Stellensbosch and Franschoek plus an amazing motor museum.Thank you so very much for making our stay in Cape Town so memorable."

Sarina took us on a full-day tour to Cape Point, Simon's Town and the Boulders Beach penguins. She also added in a boat trip to a colony of seals which was great too. The trip was such a success that we booked 3 further trips with PG Tops. On the last trip, we were lucky to have owner Pieter personally take us round the Constantia vineyards. Highly recommended.

Cape Point is an amazing location and Donna stopped twice to rescue errant tortoises that decided to cross the road in front of us. Then on to the lighthouse and a lovely lunch - Donna managed to organise a table for us so that we didn't have to queue. Finally to Boulders Beach to see the penguins, not to be missed!

After reading through T.A. for tour guide recommendations, we emailed Madelaine at PG tours and asked her about the Cape Point / Peninsula. She put together a great tour based on a couple questions around what we wanted to see and whether we wanted to just sit and ride or get out and do easy walking or take a bit more of a hike. Our tour guide, Gavin, picked us up on our hotel in a comfortable clean vehicle and off we went for a fabulous day of travel, sights and even a brisk hour hike up one of the trails around Cape Point (the highlight of our tour). Lunch in a small seaside town. Gavin's been in the tour business awhile and seems to know how much information is useful and when to just let the scenery do the talking. He also had some great tips on what to do/ where to go for some gifts we needed in Cape Town proper. Had us home to the minute when scheduled! He also was very clever about which route to take on the weekend to be ahead of the bigger crowds at the most popular stops. To be honest, i'd read that all the tour guides with PGT were good, but when we go back, we'll definitely ask for Gavin again! Given that I've been going to C.T. for almost twenty years, I really appreciated that Gavin got how much we knew and how to shift around the plans to make the trip perfect!"

The brief was very simple - we wanted to experience the sights and scenes of South Africa for 2 weeks, the first period around the Cape Town and coastal area and then move on to a few days safari in Kruger.Sofie was very professional and attentive and asked us what we liked, what level of comfort we were looking for, what food we enjoyed eating, where we liked to stay, what in particular we would like to see and so on.Nothing seemed to be an issue and Sofie e mailed us on numerous occasions and even spoke to us on the phone to try to understand our requirements more specifically.The result was a fantastic vacation staying in sumptuous accommodation, eating some lovely S African food, seeing great sights and having one of the best holidays we have ever had.Credit should also be heaped upon our guide - Johan. Throughout the Cape leg of the holiday Johan drove us over 2000km. We struck a chord with many common views and hobbies and the places we stopped at were often revised following these conversations.Vacation consisted of the following:Day 1 Arrival at CapeTown, tour of table mountain and part of city accommodation More seasons.Day 2 Penguins at Stormy point. Accommodation More SeasonsDay 3 Robben Island and Peninsula. Accommodation More SeasonsDay 4 Wine tasting in Franshoek, Motor Museum. Accommodation Le Quartier FrancaisDay 5 Alloe Fera factory, Ostrich Farm Accommodation De DenneDay 6 Knysna Featherbed visit. Accommodation Atlantic houseDay 7 Transport museum George, bird sanctuary Tsitsikama. Accommodation The FerneryDay 8 Addo National Park, Port Elizabeth Accommodation Radisson BluDay 9-12 Fly to Kruger for Safari at Lion Sands Private Game reserveOverall this offered a personalised private tour that was tailored to our requirements for a similar price to a good tour organised in the UK but with around 30 people. That personal touch and ability to modify at a moments notice was priceless and I have no hesitation to recommend the company.thanks again to Sofie, Johan and Peter at PG Tops"

My friend and I were to arrive in Cape Town on a cruise ship around 8 a.m. Our flights home were not until 6 p.m., so we were looking for a tour company that could introduce us to the sights of Cape Town and deliver us to the airport in time. I had spent quite some time in the city previously, but my friend had not. I found PG Tops Travel and Tours on Trip Advisor and made arrangements with Yolanda. Sarina was at the dock 10 minutes early ready to go. I had hoped to take the cable car to Table Mountain, but the fog prevented us from doing that. Sarina substituted Signal Mtn and a visit to Rhodes Monument where we were able to have great views of the city. We visited Hout Bay, walked through the central city, had lunch and shopped at the wharf area. It could not have been more perfect. I highly recommend this company."

What we appreciate the most is being able to talk with the guides, ask questions and have meaningful conversations about the city and the country. It was like having a friend show you around.

We did 4 days of touring with PG Tops (2 Days of Winelands, 1 Day Shark Cage Diving, and 1 Day Peninsula Tour), and it was money well spent! Our guides, Bianca and Ryan, had a ton of local knowledge, so we ended up saving time (we started our Peninsula tour early to avoid having to queue) and visiting some places we never would have found on our own (we visited a couple of great wineries that we'd never heard of and Ryan also recommended the most delicious Fish and Chips shop in Simonstown). Both Ryan and Bianca were super friendly and flexible (my husband decided that there was one particular winery he wanted to visit, so Ryan rearranged our day's plans to make sure we had time to visit it), so all four days were relaxing and stress free.One of the fun surprises for me was the Wine and Chocolate Pairing at Spier Winery. We live in Switzerland, so I was skeptical about how good the chocolate could be compared to Swiss chocolate ;), but it was super unique and delicious! The chocolates had different flavors that paired with different wines, but the real surprise was how the chocolate flavor changed the taste of the wine! Super interesting! Thanks, Bianca, for recommending that we try it!I can't wait for another chance to visit South Africa and discover more with PG Tops!"

We approached PG Tops quite late in September to take care of our itinerary planning, ground arrangements & guide for a Personalized Experience. The first e-mail itself from Ms.Yolanda was a nerve soother and we knew we were in safe hands. Complete professionalism in planning the itinerary, considering we were to complete the Garden Route from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth in 03 days flat, suggesting attractions, places to eat with due consideration for us vegetarians with kids and complete transparency in communication of the charges and the payment schedules. The icing on the cake (which we later discovered while on the tour) was their suggestion to pre-book reservations at restaurants considering the size of the group, cuisine preferences & the peak season (25th December to 30th December), that's a personal touch par excellence !!! Lots of blessings from all family members to Ms.Yolanda & the entire PG Tops team for this.Arrival day, Christmas eve, we missed connecting flights and upset our arrival schedules. The PG Tops Private Guide Mr. Rod & driver Mr. David ensured they picked us up post midnight, informed the hotel about the delay, ensured rooms were allotted and a speedy check-in with sleepy kids.The biggest satisfaction undoubtedly on the tour has been Mr. Rod (our guide), vast experience, very knowledgeable, soft spoken, a hit with the kids and the seniors of the family alike. He has ensured that all attractions as per our itinerary have been enjoyed by the family at Cape Town and along the Garden Route as well, reconfirming room reservations, restaurant reservations as well as flight timings.

Normally I rent a car but decided we were packing in a wine tour as well and I won't drink and drive so a guide was the best route. We swam with penguins, rode camels, saw Cape Point, and took some amazing pictures at the color beach huts of Muizenberg Beach and did a wine tasting tour at a beautiful winery. I know at times our tour guide may have been frustrated with our itinerary and tried to substitute another beach for Muizenberg that didn't work for us,so we held strong and required our original stop, but overall we got along fine and he was super knowledgeable about every aspect of our tour. He was a wealth of information and I was really impressed with his intelligence. I'm very glad that we chose this tour company and I think you can't go wrong in booking with PG Tops Travel and Tours.

Instead she took us to the Botanical Gardens, a wine tasting in Constantia, and we had lunch and walked around the Company Gardens. She even incorporated our request for a beer stop and we spent a fun afternoon at Beerhouse on Long and wrapped up with Signal Hill. It was a great first impression of Cape Town, thanks Bianca for a fun first day in the city!"

The scenery here is beautiful. Pieter was very knowledgeable and luckily for us he is also a photographer and so shared some handy tips. Our next stop was Boulders beach and the Penguin colony - which is amazing, it is as though the Penguins are on holiday! We thoroughly recommend PG Tops Tours and if you are interested in photography ask for Pieter."

I'm very glad they did because it was fantastic. Yolanda bent over backwards for us and made miracles happen on the busiest week of the year in Cape Town. We had different tour guides each day and while each of them was great we were really impressed with Ryan. Ryan was very knowledgable about the area and history and he gave us great tips about things to do on our free time. He even ordered pizza for us when we couldn't get our phone working. We were very impressed that not only did PG Tops help us out when no-one else was even interested, but they still went out of there way to make sure we had a great time while in Cape Town."

We had a great lunch in Simon's Town and absolutely loved seeing the penguins at the hidden beach (not just the boardwalk) at Boulder's beach.

They were recommended by friends who used them last year and we now owe those friends an appreciation cocktail. From the very first email inquiry, I knew that we were in good hands.I cannot possibly say enough kind words about Sarina, our coordinator. I looked forward to every email response that I received from her. We were a group of five, all with differing thoughts on itineraries and juggling changes and recommendations and additions was no problem at all. Sarina was on it every step of the way with kind words, professionalism and a fantastic sense of humor.We used them for our airport transfer (Sarina was gracious enough to pick us up at 11:00pm), a tour to Gansbaai (stopped for whale watching, lunch at a winery and a pick up of a friend who did the shark dive) and a full day tour to Cape Point, Cape of Good Hope and an ostrich farm. And transport to and from a wedding (sorry Pieter ;-) For the day tours, our guide was Jarred and he is terrific! Super knowledgeable, not only on sites and history, but plant life and ecosystems. He was very accommodating, very entertaining and quite funny. We all really enjoyed his guide skills and friendly nature.And for every transfer and pick up, not only did they arrive on time, but 5 minutes early which we appreciated (tho, we may not have been ready, we loved the punctuality).And note, Sarina is now a full fledged tour guide. If you are lucky enough to have either of them, you will have a great time.We feel like we made friends in Cape Town and hope to return soon and take advantage of other tours that they offer and their generous and genuine hospitality."

He picked a wonderfully scenic winery-restaurant for lunch and had informed them of our vegan requests prior to arrival.

We ended up having three different guides during our week in Cape town due to having to break up our tour days across a week. Rudi gave us a tour of the city of Cape Town that included all the typical attractions. The tour was a good starting point for us as we had arrived late the previous evening. The winds kicked up and the 'tablecloth' surrounded Table mountain so we had to postpone our tour up the mountain for another day. For our safari at Inverdoorn, Jared picked us up from our hotel and actually rode along in the Land Rover with us while on safari which was helpful with his previous experience as a safari guide. We were able to ask him questions/comments that he saw on the day at Inverdoorn on the ride back to Cape Town. For the Biscuit Mill, township tour, and Stellenbosch trip we had Godfrey. The walking tour through the streets of the Langa township was authentic and made you feel like you were able to see exactly how the people that live in those types of settings live day to day. Godfrey is very well known in that area and we felt comfortable learning about the area with him as our guide. Our last two days around Cape Town were again spent with Jared around Cape Point and Cape Peninsula. We felt extremely comfortable with Jared and his approach with customers is top notch. All the trips were outstanding and we overall felt very lucky to have PG Tops organize our trip for us and cater to what we either did or didn't want to see while we were on vacation. Originally we had pursued Clive to be our tour guide but he kindly referred us to PG Tops. Initially we felt disappointed to not had reserved Clive without enough advance notice but in the end were thrilled with PG Tops. Sofia was our main contact person ahead of time and her timely and professional responses to our emails showed us that they ran a good business and cared about their customers. If we ever go back to Cape Town (hopefully someday :) we would definitely reserve PG Tops to guide us around again! Thank you to PG Tops (and especially Rudi, Godfrey, and Jared)!"

After flying into Cape Town late the prior evening with my wife and my twin 11 year old daughters, we awoke to what we now understand to be a fairly typical strong breeze for Cape Town in the warmer months. So strong that the table mountain cable car was on wind hold! With that our plans to go up table mountain went out the window, so we decided to try and get on a tour out to the cape of good hope. Having discovered that most organised tours had already left that morning, I rang several private tour operators and they all were full - not surprising given I was calling for an appointment for that same day! One referred me to PG Tops. Having had a quick look on the website and the trip advisor ratings I called PG Tops and the rest is history. PG himself was very helpful and a private tour was promptly organised. We were picked up from our accommodation in the waterfront area by our guide Deon. Deon treated us to a very special day indeed! We drove out from Cape Town past the stadium and along the water through Sea Point and Clifton and then up the stunning Chapman's Peak drive, before heading down into Simon's Town to see the penguin colony at the Boulders, which we all loved. From there we headed out to Cape Point and then around to the Cape of Good Hope, where we caught the venicular railway to the top of the point for the spectacular views. This was topped off by a late lunch at the Two Oceans restaurant up at the Cape, which was also very good. After lunch we drove back via Constantia wine country which was very nice. The views of the Cape on our drive on a very windy but very clear day were just spectacular. Deon kept the kids and ourselves constantly entertained with story after story - everything about different land marks, through to South African politics and history, health and wellness and everything in between. It was a fantastic conversation! Along the way we had the chance to see penguins, seals, baboons, ostrich and rock rabbits/Dassie. It was a super day and I couldn't speak highly enough of both Deon for being a fantastic guide and PG for turning what started as a frustrating morning into a brilliant day for our family!"

We were able to pin down our preferences and they provided us with the perfect guide for our styles. Bianca got us into Table Mountain early in the morning and the day was spectacular. She was able to help us navigate the area on the waterfront without treating us like children. She answered a thousand questions. The best part was on the second day we decided to leave earlier than planned and she was very accomodating. PG Tops even refunded part of our prepayment due to the way our tour unfolded on day 1 with our spending the afternoon on Robben Island and not with PG Tops, which was something we didn't expect. This type of action was above and beyond what was expected and was the type of service we expereienced from the staff and from our guide. I think that the best way to see a new part of the world is with a private guide and PG Tops was an excellent service. I highly recommend them on your excursion into Capetown. Nancy"

He absolutely knew everything and was so sweet! Would highly recommend!"

My son had just come from the North Cape of Norway so top of Europe to bottom of Africa in 10 days meant he was pretty well 'caped' this year! Rudi our guide is a great raconteur and a mine of useful information on the regions we passed through and on South Africa in general, and seems to have been to even more places around the globe than us - including beating us to the North Cape! Anyone who, like Rudi, has been to Easter Island for their birthday just has to trump me and my travel tales! The great thing about driving with just us and Rudi in the car was that we could converse with each other rather than as often happens with larger groups in buses when the guide tends to talk at you rather then with you. PG Tops offer lots more trips and next time we're in South Africa (my youngest daughter was much taken with hearing about our penguin sightings at Boulders Beach so another visit is definitely on the cards!) we will try some more, including to Langa Township. Friendly people and great service - PG Tops are hard to beat - give them a try!"

For one of the days, I booked a full day Cape Peninsula Tour along with a stop for a little wine tasting at Constantia Glen. Our day was fabulous. Our guide, Richard, picked us up at our hotel and our adventure began. We had a very comfortable van. Richard had grown up in the Cape Town area and was very knowledgeable of everything we were going to see. We stopped at Hout Bay where you can do a little shopping from the vendors that have set up at the harbor. We then went to Cape Point and walked up to the lighthouse. Richard suggested lunch at the restaurant there called Two Oceans. The timing was perfect and it wasn't too crowded. Our lunch was delicious and the views were beautiful. We then went to the Cape of Good Hope and then Boulders Beach Penguin Colony and ending with wine tasting before being dropped off at our hotel. Richard was such a nice and easy going guy. We never felt rushed and were able to see and do everything the four of us wanted to do. To set up the tour, I emailed with Thami who got back to me and assured me that we could do everything that was on my list."

TO begin with this tour company is excellent and specifically Richard the guide is the person you should have your tours with.We had stumbled upon PG tops and tours was through another guide while we were enquiring on the various tours. My initial correspondence and mails was with Thami. He was well informed about the tours and we were able to finalize the tours and deals with him. Here I must say that it is a private guided tour hence it is coming cheap. We reached Capetown and had our tours the next day which to begin was quite disappointing as there was no tour guide at the allocated time i.e. 9am. When contacted we were being given different times which led to a lot of confusion. After all that at 10:30 am the tour guide was there and let me tell you after that all the early morning confusion was just forgotten. Richard the guide who came was excellent, he was just too good in terms of knowledge of the place, very friendly and was ready to go that extra mile just to make us satisfied and happy. We were also visited by the owner of PG tops Peter at the cape of god hope were he was apologetic for the morning mess and also gave a free R500 worth lunch for the mistake and it is rarely that you see such good gestures. Richard even went out of the way and took us to a great farm house restaurant called IMHOFF. The food was not only amazing but it was like one of the bes tlunch we had during our stay in Cape town. All in all this company is god and should you want to book any tours do it without hesitation. I understand that PG tours does take care of their guests and my above report should support my statement."

After numerous apologies, they made up for not meeting us at airport, by providing lunch on the tour days. We did the table mountain hike with Frank, who was an excellent guide explaining at every point as we hiked up and back down the mountain. The hike was challenging, but Frank kept a good pace and allowed us to rest when we needed. Then the city tour, the district 6 museum, peninsula tour, Capepoint tour, boulders beach to see the penguins, the botanical gardens with our guide Jarred was most enjoyable. Jarred was very knowledgeable and pleasant. I would not hesitate to recommend Pg Tops to anyone who is travelling to Capetown."

I had originally booked a peninsula tour with PG Tops for our final day in Cape Town, intending to tour Robben Island on our own the day before. But we were dumb and forgot to pre-order our tickets for the Robben Island ferry, and they were sold out when we got to the ticket office. There were still tickets available for the following day (our last in Cape Town), but we had the peninsula tour already booked. I found PG's contact information and got through to Yolanda who immediately set to work trying to accommodate us for a peninsula tour THAT day, instead of as scheduled, so that we could still tour Robben Island before leaving Cape Town. Yolanda connected us with Pieter, and after a couple short phone calls our schedule change was confirmed. Pieter, the founder/owner of PG Tops, couldn't find another driver to take us so last minute, so he changed his personal plans for the day and drove us himself. We were completely blown away by this incredible display of customer service. It was about an hour from the time we placed our initial call to Yolanda, to the time Pieter picked us up at our hotel for our last minute peninsula tour. The tour itself was absolutely perfect. Pieter was a wonderful guide and super knowledgeable. The day was our favorite in Cape Town."

I had never been to Africa before and would have only one day for any sightseeing, with a 7:30 flight at the end. I am not a group tour sort of person, so I looked for a provider with whom I could book a custom, personal tour that would give me a chance to do a little hiking. I was actually referred to PG Tops by another provider. Nela was fantastic to work with to set up the tour, she was very responsive and had a quote to me within hours, and answered all my miscellaneous questions very promptly and in a very friendly manner. After a rainy few days I was blessed with a clear and sunny Saturday. Jarred Vosges was my tour guide, and he was tremendous and friendly and relaxing to spend the day with. I did not have a lot of time to research the area before my trip, but I learned a lot from Jarred. He has a very nice, low key , conversational style of telling the history of the region and the plants and animals without being preachy or boring at all. He was also very flexible in rearranging the day to fit in things like Table Mountain and Chapman;s Peak Drive , which were closed earlier in the day but open later. I went to Cape Point and did the walks to the lighthouses, and then a point to point hike on the boardwalk to the Cape of Good Hope. I was initially surprised Jarred didn't actually hike with me at Cape Point, but it's not like it is possible to get lost- and after a week of business meals and meetings, I found I really enjoyed the freedom and solitude to go at my own pace. Plus it was great to do the Cape Point to Cape of Good Hope as a point to point. Jarred recommended a side visit to the beach in between, which was great as I had it entirely to myself. We got to do Chapman's Peak drive going north, and we visited the penguins at Boulder Beach. I did have a little problem at Table Mountain, which was the last stop before the airport - a cloud started peeking over right as I ascended and the entire top was in a fog. I couldn't see anything but more importantly, the line to get down (it was 5 PM) was extremely long and I worried about missing my flight. I pled my case, and showed my itinerary to the cable car operator and they let me bypass the line (hate to ask for special treatment but sometimes it's necessary!) . Jarred got me to the airport on time. I had a fantastic day and if I can ever come back and bring my family I know who to go to. I will also point out, though it was not the major part of my decision that the tour price was $100-$200 less than the quotes I received from other companies, who were also much slower in answering."

He had pre booked three different wineries that were all excellent, and again made a lunch reservation ahead of time. We wanted to spend some extra time in the surrounding towns and he happily accommodated, and knew the area well to give us the history as we went. Both days were amazing, and we saw much more than we would have been able to on a group tour or on our own. I would highly recommend PG Tops travel to anyone visiting Cape Town! Tammy B"

My husband and I along with my parents spent two and a half days in mid-May touring Cape Town with Bianca from PG Tops Tours and had a great time. Prior to our trip, I had been referred to PG Tops by another company who could not accommodate our reservation. I had many emails back and forth with Sophie who was great at making recommendations and listening to what we're interested in doing in order to come up with a great itinerary. Once settled, we paid half via PayPal before our trip and the balance on the last day of the tour. The costs included our private tour with Bianca in a very nice, clean van, as well as all entrance fees along the way. The only thing not included were meals during the outings, but we knew that ahead of time. We went up to Table Mountain and to Lions Head the first day. Bianca was great--she had gone to our inn to pick us up at the prearranged time, but we were running a bit late since we wanted to have lunch after cleaning up from our international flight before our tour. She came to get us at the restaurant and waited while we finished. At Table Mountain and Lions Head she never rushed us--the amount of time we spent or the amount walking was completely up to us...you never felt rushed. The next day we toured the peninsula --- we stopped to feed the ostrich and shop at the ostrich farm, we were lucky to see wild ostrich on the beach on the way to the Cape of Good Hope, visited the Cape of Good Hope, the lighthouse, sat down to eat at the Two Oceans Restaurant, and visited the Penguins at Boulder beach. Again, the day was at ease and at our pace making for a very personal experience. Bianca did what we wanted at our pace--if we wanted to spend and hour walking along the beach to get good pictures of the wild ostrich, no problem; if we wanted to walk or ride up to the lighthouse it was up to us. The final day, PG Tops had arranged a private tour of Kirstenbosch for us with one of their head botanists as my father is a semi-professional gardener. I had tried to contact Kirstenbosch directly as the gardening journals had recommended doing this to get the private tour and access to the non-public greenhouses; however, the garden had never responded directly. PG Tops made it happen. We finished our day with wine tasting and lunch at Constantia. Bianca was great and very enjoyable to spend our tour with. She even had authentic South African license plates made for my husband who collects them from all over the world. All in all, we were very pleased. we didn't make it to the Castle of Good Hope because we spent so much time at the garden, but that was our choice and not our priority and Bianca offered to return the entrance fee for that. We were extremely lucky in that our weather was sunny, clear and beautiful for the most part). If you want personalized tour without being pressured, I highly recommend PG Tops and Bianca. Just communicate your priorities and they will make it happen. Cape Town is great and PG Tops makes it even more enjoyable."

This was our first visit to Cape Town and we planned a few sightseeing days before boarding our cruise ship for the return to the UK.We wanted to make the most of what could well be a \"once in a lifetime\" visit, so we checked carefully through the Trip Advisor reviews and finally chose this company. What a good decision!!!Our local itinerary was as follows:-Day 1 - early morning arrival at CPT. We were met and via a brief orientation tour, taken to our hotel, the Radisson Blu Waterfront, again another excellent choice. We spent the rest of the day walking around the upmarket V&A Waterfront, a great place to unwind and to buy our first souvenirs!Day 2 - Cape Town tour including Table Mountain and Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens.Day 3 - Cape Winelands tour including several wineries and Franschhoek and Stellenbosch, plus an amazing restaurant overlooking the Franschhoek valley for lunch.Day 4 - Cape Peninsula tour to Cape Point including Chapman's Peak Drive.Day 5 - Overburg tour to Herrnanus and one of our favourite locations, the Creation Winery in the Hemel en Aarde Valley (Heaven on Earth), - the name speaks for itself!Day 6 - Sadly the end of our time in Cape Town with a transfer to the port to join our cruise ship. All of these tours had amazing highlights, too many to recount in this short review. Having our own guide meant that we could plan each day, vary timings and our initial schedule, to cater for our individual requirements and as a further example of flexibility, make sure we ascended Table Mountain when the weather was appropriate. Of course we had wonderful views, which may not have been the case if this planning and flexibility were not possible.Throughout our guide was Jarred Vosges. He was superb, polite, punctual, easy to talk to, about pretty well anything and became a \"friend\". We could not think of anything he could have done differently to make this experience match our \"once in a lifetime\" requirement. However we now feel that a return visit, perhaps at a different time of year, must be near the top of our personal \"bucket list\"."

While we had arranged for a Cape Point Tour, Johan took the time to listen to what we had already done on our generic bus tours in Cape Town, and adapted his tour (significantly) to fit our needs, including a detour to the Table Mountain Tram that wasn't anywhere near the original route. He was pleasant, had a wealth of local information, took us \"off the beaten path\" a couple of times to show us some of his favorite spots, took pictures of the two of us in all the right places, and helped my wife identify and photograph essentially every flowering plant between Cape Town and Cape Point. He helped us get restaurant reservations at the Two Ocean Restaurant at Cape Point, and even made great recommendations on what to order. Both the money and the time (from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM) we spent was well worth it!Sofie was a gem. During the weeks and days leading up to our visit I would preliminary schedule and then not get back to her; on several occasions due to other traveling we were doing that limited our access to WiFi. She stuck with us to the end. The day before the tour, I let her know that due to hearing issues, it was essential that we have a guide that spoke English clearly and would take my limitation into account. Even with such short notice (actually less than 24 hours from the time someone would be picking us up) she was able to provide us with Johan, who met our requirements perfectly. I would absolutely without qualification recommend Johan and the good folks at PG Tops Travel to anyone interested in a tour. While it is unlikely we'll ever run into anybody where we live (Mountain states of USA) that will be looking for a guide, we hope we do, so we can make a referral.

We found PG Tops when looking for day tours to the Cape of Good Hope and around wine country during a trip to Cape Town, and we were were thoroughly impressed. First, the office staff was extremely helpful and made the reservations very clear and easy. Second, it seemed that they matched us to the perfect guide for our tours - Erica. Throughout our two week travels in South Africa, we had three different tour guides, and Erica was far and above the best! She was extremely knowledgeable and charming, and she really took the time to get to know us on the tours and make any adjustments possible to personalize our experiences. We first took a great tour through the Cape of Good Hope, and she shared all her favorite spots for wildlife watching and really appreciating nature. On our second day (our wedding anniversary), we toured wineries that she had chosen perfectly to share the great wines, foods, and scenery but also to celebrate our special day. We couldn't have asked for a better guide, and we certainly couldn't have put together such memorable experiences without her expert help. She and PG Tops made our anniversary day and trip very special, and we'd strongly recommend her and PG Tops to anyone looking for a tour guide around Cape Town!"

            "review": "2 fabulous days - Cape Point, Boulders, Langa Township, and Stellenbosch. This was my parents' first trip to Africa and I could think of no one more capable to show them the city of Cape Town than Pieter Geldenhuys of PG Tops. While traveling in South Africa last year with friends, I was introduced to Pieter through a former client who raved about what an amazing time they had. Pieter designed a completely custom city tour based upon our interests and knowledge of the city including my desire to try \"bunny chow\" (it's delicious, by the way). He also charmed the pants off (figuratively, of course) all 4 of us! So, given the short period of time we had to spend in the city pre- and post-safari I immediately thought of PG Tops. Day 1 was focused on mom who was excited to see Cape Point and the penguin colony at Boulders Beach. We also stopped in Hout Bay to see the seals and continued on to Kalk Bay for a bit of shopping. At every step, Pieter gave us options and never seemed to hurry. We couldn't have asked for a better guide or a more fun day. Day 2 began with a township tour led by Odwa. He offered us a unique view of life in an urban township and shared a great deal of his personal struggle growing up in Langa in a poor, single-parent home. His story is one of great hope and courage, and shows just how much South Africa has evolved in the last 20 years. He believes in the idea of South Africa as a \"Rainbow Nation\" and he'll make you believe it too:) After this Pieter collected us to head out to Cheetah Outreach and Somerset West for an amazing lunch at Waterkloof. The wine, food, view and venue were outstanding. I am pretty sure this is heaven on earth. More options were offered after lunch and we chose to continue on to Stellenbosch for a quick drive thru the town and the University, and a tasting at Ken Forrester. It is hard for me to imagine how these days could have been any more pleasant, informative, and seamless. Pieter has an amazing ability to read people and cater to their interests and time constraints. I can't say enough good things about the PG Tops Team."

            "review": "First Rate Tour , Fantastic!!. A first rate tour experience in Cape Town with PG Tops Tour & TravelWe are following up on a 4-day private tour booked through PG Tops Tour and Travel company in Cape Town from December 22-26, 2014. There were four of us traveling from Canada. We arrived in Cape Town, after disembarking from a 30-day cruise aboard Nautica with Oceania Cruise Lines.We booked our tour through Bianca at PG Tops. We have nothing but praise for Bianca, the tour company and guides. Everything went so very smoothly, hitting all the highlights we had hoped for and more, as well all the guides were so friendly, courteous and very knowledgeable...Bianca, Jarrett and Rod. Our tour days with PG Tops tour company capped off a wonderful 6-weeks of travel...terrific finale.To highlight some of the many positives that made Bianca and PG Tops tour company a standout in our minds.1. PROMPT RESPONSE: At the outset I'd sent a number of emails to various tour companies in Cape Town that I'd researched online. Initially, I did not have this company's email, however one of the companies I'd initially sent an email to did respond but unfortunately it was booked, however this company did recommend PG Tops as a very good tour company. I followed up this suggestion with a quick email to PG Tops tour company. PG Tops representative, Bianca, responded promptly....very quick considering the time difference. This was before I'd had any response from the remaining companies which I'd emailed days prior. We found this most impressive as this suggested reliability to us. This along with Bianca's friendly, professional style, sold us on this company immediately.2. COMMUNICATIONS: My many communications with Bianca were always very promptly answered, and always addressed my queries and any concerns. Considering the significant time difference between Canada and Cape Town; if I sent an email early in the day I would always have a response by the end of the day. If I sent an email late in the day, there would always be a response very early the following morning. Bianca made many excellent suggestions and followed through on everything, particularly Robben Island tickets which were initially sold-out (late June ) since our time in Cape Town was during the very busy Christmas season. We were very disappointed, however Bianca did keep our hopes alive by saying she would keep track to see if additional ferries would be added to the schedule at a later date. True to her word Bianca followed up and quickly notified us when additional tickets became available. She was able to purchase tickets for Robben Island so we would not be disappointed....pleased us immensely since this was a must-see site while in Cape Town.3. STRATEGIC PLANNING: The order of the tour sites visits was organized by Bianca according to the demands of the busy tourist season/Christmas...earlier morning starts (7:30 am) for Table Mountain and Cape Point. This allowed us to spend adequate, quality time at each site during this busy season, including those times when some venues closed earlier than usual on Christmas Eve. Pick-up was always prompt and on time. The early morning starts were arranged so that we would not be subjected to long lines and throngs of people and tour buses. This was so very much appreciated as it made all the difference and alleviated any frustration. We were always able to move about the venues with ease, and most importantly we were able to get the best photos from all vantage points without waiting and jostling among numerous other avid photographers. Also, Bianca was very astute with an excellent memory. At some point during our communications I\u2019d mentioned that we were avid golfers. Keeping this in mind she planned our final stop on the Winelands day tour a visit to Ernie Els winery in Stellenbosch. It was a highlight; the wine tasting itself was a wonderful, sophisticated experience.....tasting 4 generous fine wine samples sipped while relaxing in comfortable chairs under large sun umbrellas overlooking the beautiful vineyard dotted valley of Stellenbosch. As a bonus we had the opportunity to view Ernie\u2019s trophy room and to purchase monogrammed souvenir golf shirts, caps and ball markers. 5. PROVIDING TOTAL EXPERIENCE: Efforts were always made to have us experience as many sites as possible, i.e. The Noon Gun, Bo-Kapp, City Tour, which we had thought we would not get to see owing to our limited time and busy schedule of sites. The tour schedule set up allowed us to see all the major sites plus these additional ones which were a welcome bonus for us. As well, Bianca was so thoughtful in arranging lunches at lovely restaurants which served excellent food in the most beautiful locations.6. VEHICLES: The vehicle/van in which we toured was clean, comfortable, spacious and new....a white Mercedes van. This adds to the experience and impression that this company is dedicated to provide comfort, reliability and an overall quality experience.7. OUTSTANDING GUIDES: Bianca, Jarrett, and Rod were all very friendly, knowledgeable and truly seemed to enjoy their jobs and were happy to be guiding us about. (Note: our day with Jarrett was a different type of tour day; Robben Island and Table Mountain, however he provided us with an excellent experience as well.) Bianca was so energetic and enthusiastic, making our 2 days to the Winelands and Cape Point, breathtaking, informative, very memorable and so much fun. Rod was very knowledgeable and his suggestion to drive to Hermanus was a bonus on Christmas Day when we didn't know what to do prior to our drop-off at the airport in the early evening. As well, we were very impressed with Rod\u2019s caring nature. When Rod dropped us off, he remained with us at the airport to ensure that we had our tickets, boarding passes, luggage checked and all things completed for our departure and journey home....a relief for us. He provided so much interesting background to the areas during our drive and went out of his way to ensure that we did do everything possible, including washroom breaks and coffee stops, even though much was closed, this being Christmas Day. Overall, we were so fortunate to have had the highest quality tour experience provided by Bianca and PG Tops Tour and Travel Company. We had a fantastic time and will be recommending Bianca and PG Tops to anyone who might plan to travel to Cape Town.Thank you so much to Bianca and PG Tops for a wonderful tour experience in Cape Town."

            "review": "Over priced/under delivered. I had arrived in Cape Town four days early to join a land tour; decided to put three of those days to best use by contracting PG Tops. Caren, from the office, was delightful in the arrangements. 1. I had heard stellar reviews on Stellenbosch and, as a wine enthusiast, was looking forward to the experience in the Winelands Tour. Unfortunately, Bianca told me that we would end up in the middle of the rush hour and was not worth it so I agreed in order to keep her within the schedule. Consequently I was dropped at the hotel half an hour early with nothing left to do. Could we have included the area at least if not the wines?2. I have developed a love for penguins in the Antarctic and thus my highlight for the Cape Point tour was to visit them in their habitat. We went to a lookout point which was nice but from a distance. I was told by people in my land tour later that the penguins walk right up to you on the beach was shown some awesome pictures. Why wasn\u2019t I given this option?3. The same day we went to lunch after climbing to the lighthouse. The place was expensive so I ordered the most reasonable item I could find on the menu for about US$10. I was impressed that she ordered an item for US$16. plus a latte assuming that the tour company was very generous with her allowance. I was jealous because her dish looked fantastic - until the bill arrived - and she made no effort to cover her meal. When I asked whether I was supposed to pay, Bianca replied coyly that if I wanted to... So I did. This backfired for her because I had already made a mental note about her tip which, as a typical North American, was going to be over the top. So, that night I did research on the internet and in the hotel and found out that in South Africa you tip R100 for a full day and R50 for a half day. Basically she ate two days\u2019 work of tips and I saved a significant amount of money.4. On the half day City tour we went to Table Mountain. Bianca seemed to be in a bad mood and left me running after her in her dust following her up to the cable car. Being a senior and having difficulty breathing in the extreme heat of the day, I was extremely uncomfortable and frustrated but kept my thoughts to myself to avoid confrontation. We went to another view point and to the Company Gardens. The latter is a total waste of time. Then she dropped me half an hour early at my hotel. Having passed on the museum and the Castle of Good Hope and its entrance fees which were saved by the tour company, I asked if I wouldn\u2019t get a glimpse of the city. Bianca again said that the traffic was bad. I then asked if I could at least get a peek at the Bo-Kaap area. Bianca asked gruffly, so do you want me to take you there at which point I told her to forget it. She then started the car again and took me grudgingly to one street in the Bo-Kaap area. I took a picture and returned to the hotel which was very near.5. At this point I told her how I felt about the lunch the day before. Bianca said defensively that guests usually pay. My response was that I should have been notified by the PG Tops of the expected additional cost of a luxury lunch for the guide to be included in my budget. I had never encountered this in the past anywhere else.6. I did take the Hop-On-Hop Off the next day for the City, Constancia, and the Botanical Gardens on my own on the following day. I regret that I didn\u2019t do so from the very beginning instead of the overpriced City Tour.I have to ask, if there where to occasions when traffic was an obstacle why time wasn\u2019t better managed by those in the know by reversing the schedule. Why is it that a guest is imposed with a meal that has not been accounted for? Why am I left to walk behind the guide?"

I travel a lot for business, and had never thought about looking into a tour company, but on my recent trip to Cape Town, when I would have two extra days before departing, I decided to give it a try. I wasn't going to rent a car, so how else could I see some of this part of the world that I had never been to before? I had my doubts, but Rudi put them to rest right off the bat. I sat in the front seat and he made me feel like I was just visiting a (very knowledgeable) local friend, showing me around the area. Rudi let me decide how long I wanted to spend shopping with the local vendors, or stopping for photos, or hiking. He answered all my questions, and if he didn't know the answer (like the latitude of Cape Town) he looked it up on his smart phone. I doubt I will be back to South Africa, but I will definitely recommend PG Tops tours to any friends or colleagues who will be visiting Cape Town. Rudi really made it feel like my visit was complete! (He even helped me find a Laundromat once we got back to the area of my hotel!)"

PG Tops received such positive reviews so we decided to book with them and are so happy we did. We booked a day trip to the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Point along with a day safari to Aquila Game Reserve. Working with Barbara to book the 2 trips was a charm. She responded promptly to all our questions and offered services we didn\u2019t even request. Aquila does not confirm pick up times until the evening prior and we had no cell service in Cape Town. Barbara followed up with Aquila the evening before (outside of her working hours) and emailed us with the pick-up times. This type of customer service is what makes a company great!Our trip to the Cape of Good Hope was with a private guide, Andrew. He was prompt in picking us up and was a wealth of information on the Cape Town area and South Africa in general. It was so interesting spending the day with him. Our \u201cschedule\u201d for the day was very flexible and we were able to spend as much, or little, time at each stop as we chose. The Aquila trip was an amazing experience. It\u2019s a small park but that offers the opportunity to see many animals. The staff is friendly and the 2 meals we had there, breakfast and lunch, were wonderful. So, if you\u2019re having difficulty deciding on which tour company to use, look no further. You can\u2019t go wrong with PG Tops."

Barbara Wild was the main point of contact for setting up this unforgettable trip. She appointed Jamie as our tour guide. She was perfect. The scenery was amazing and Jamie was super knowledgable. She did such a wonderful job. Nice, friendly, funny - what more can you ask for?If you are travelling to Cape Town - you need to book a private tour. If you are booking a private tour - Choose PG Tops and Jamie (although I'm sure everyone is equally as professional). We did both the Cape Point and Vineyard tours. Both were perfect. They even helped us set up a shark cage diving day through a different company because we hadn't booked ahead of time. That is true customer service. No need to look anywhere else."

I booked two private day trips--Winelands and Cape Point--and both were wonderful experiences. Jarred drove us to Cape Point and he was perfect for us as he had the conservation/ranger background; very knowledgeable about the unique floral kingdom of the Cape. Bianca took us through wine country and she was also terrific. Both helped make my spouse's first visit to Africa a special experience.PG Tops will help recommend a specific itinerary and your guide will adapt the day to the weather and/or your interests. I organized everything by email (and PayPal) and all we had to do was stumble into the lobby of our hotel at the right time on the right morning and we were off. Magic."

She was super helpful on her emails with me giving all sorts of advice on the best tours to do whilst we were there. She even took time to answer my questions about what restaurants to eat in! From the very start she kept me fully updated with ultra-quick responses to any questions I asked. On the day we were picked up by Godfrey who lived in the Township we were visiting. The tour was really great and an amazing experience from start to finish. We used three different tour companies whilst we were in South Africa and I would say PG Tops gets the best marks. Ten out of ten! Thank you so much"

A relaxing day for the passengers!Joe, our guide to Cape Point, took us via Camps Bay, Hout Bay, Chapmans Peak and the National Park to the Cape of Good Hope, where we decided to do the 40 mins or so walk to Cape Point. After a nice lunch (with yet more wine), we visited the Penguins at Boulders Beach and the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens. Again another very relaxing day, Joe certainly knows all the best scenic photo spots."

One can easily spend another several days there so we wanted to make the best use of our time. Moreover, it was high season during the Christmas holidays, which meant we would need to work our way among many other tourists. Therefore, we opted for a private, day-long Cape Peninsula tour and chose PG Tops due to its high TripAdvisor rating.Reserving a place with PG Tops through Barbara Wild was easy. Our guide, Andrew Penn, who was subcontracting to PG Tops, was superb. He was timely to our downtown hotel at 7:30 am. He wisely got us started early because the Cape of Good Hope park becomes crowded. We headed right to the Cape, arrived at the park entrance with a short queue of three cars ahead of us, then viewed the lighthouse and the several capes there including the Cape of Good Hope. In later morning we headed to Seaforth Restaurant in Simon's Town for an excellent meal on the deck and then viewed the penguins at Boulders Beach. Andrew then drove us over Chapman's Peak Drive to Constantia Glen Winery, a good choice with a wonderful view from the verandah. From there we returned to our hotel between 5 and 6 pm.It was a full day and Andrew ensured it was a productive one. He expertly steered us away from traffic. For example, when we left the park around 11 am, the queue to enter the park probably stretched for a quarter mile or more Just as importantly, Andrew, as a native of Cape Town, knew the city and vicinity intimately. He provided us with historical, natural, political, cultural and other information, and he was able to answer our many questions over the course of the day. Moreover, he was a delightful companion over lunch and at the winery.Based on our very positive experience, I recommend both PG Tops and Andrew."

The information given was first class & as good as you get anywhere if not better. The tours were loaded with interest & for a stranger to Cape Town we certainly got full value. The trip to the District Six Museum & Robben Island was extremely informativeThe second tour by Yolande was excellent with a vast amount of knowledge of the area given to keep us well informed. We were introduced to all of the major points of interest around CT & the Point to which we are extremely grateful. It is certainly a pleasure to have been shown around by two fantastic tour guidesTo be picked up & dropped off at your door step was a cherry on top of the cake since to drive into an unknown part of the city would have immediately stressed us out which would no doubt have dulled our experience. The final point is that by having done the two organised trips, our lay out of the area was enhanced to such an extent that made our own ventures very easy to follow by having been given a heads up on routes to followWell done to Bianca & Yolande plus all of the background staff for having arranged the tripsCheersD A RAMSAY"

As a traveler that generally hates group tours, I was looking for a company that offered private tours for a solo traveler. Cape Town is not like European cities where there is a large infrastructure for public transportation, especially to the peninsula areas of the cape. So I wanted someone to take me around for the day that would hit some key places I wanted to go to such as Cape Point and Boulders Colony, but also show me some off the beaten path stuff. The company I had booked a wine tour through for a separate day actually recommended PG Tops to me for booking a private tour. I reached out and Sofie was quick to respond with a wealth of information. She was great in giving me options and setting up my tour! Pieter was my tour guide for the day, which was surprising as he's the owner of the company. I felt a little bad he was stuck with just me for the day but he was great and extremely knowledgeable! He offered up more recommendations, discussed how I like to travel and took me to a great whole in the wall place with tasty samosas on the way to our other destinations. Pieter was spot on for timing (getting to places before the crowds landed) also did a good balancing act of showing me around while also giving me space to venture out on my own at times. Oh, and he also has a great soundtrack in the car. We ended the tour with Wilson Phillips, Release Me. How awesome is that?! Thanks to team PG Tops for a great day!"

We wrote PG Tops and asked if they could help us out with the things we wanted to do/see (Cape Peninsula, City tour which also included Langa Township and Table Mountain, and the wine country). From the first e-mail reply, we had the feeling that this was a greaet company with a high service level and fair prices .When we told them we wanted to do Robben island on \"our own day\" in the city, they offered to buy the tickets, so we wouldn't have to deal with that - I know it's a minor thing, but I really enjoy those small details.We had Rudi as our guide for the Cape Peninsula and the city tour - he was very pleasent company, and was very well informed about everything. He made our days very flexible, helping make sure we got the most out of it. One of the other \"small details\" they had arranged, was a booked table at the nice restaurant at Cape Point - a very nice place to enjoy lunch.Peter was our guide on the wine tour, which also was both funny and informative. None of us had any wine knowledge - we primary went on this tour for the beauty of the countryside (and it really is beautiful), but Peter shared all his wine-tasting knowledge (in very entertaining ways), and brought us to some interesting places. He had also picked a great restaurant for our lunch, and helped us book a table for dinner as well (at a restaurant he recommended after he had learned what kind of food we were looking for) - again minor details that just added to the whole experience.We had 4 great days in Cape Town - and 3 of them were with great help from PG Tours. If ever in Cape Town, I'm sure I'll contact them again, to help me go experience some of the things we didn't have time to do during this visit.The service were excellent in all aspects, and we all agreed that the guides were really good as well - we felt very comfortable and well taken care of, so all in all, I highly recommend contacting PG Tours and let them help you get the most out of your Cape Town visit."

Pretty much everyone offers the same and there were a lot of reviews of every tour company that sounded like all tour companies in Cape Town are the best yet all the tours were sort of packaged deals that everyone did. Long and short of it we did 3 days of day tours, Wine Country, Cape Peninsula, and Cape Town City tour. The only one that I would recommend for a private tour would be Cape Peninsula the other two I recommend a small group and you will save some money and probably make new friends.

My husband and I were in Cape Town for the first leg of our honeymoon and as we were not hiring a car we wanted to do a day trip to the winelands and to the Cape Penninsula, so before we left we booked two trips with PG Tops. We booked two private tours for each of the trips and both itineraries sounded amazing. Our guide Jamie was just fantastic. Knowledgeable, friendly, funny and reliable both of our trips were highlights of our honeymoon. Our first day trip was to the winelands. Jame picked us up at 8.30am and we drove to Stellanbosch, along the way she filled is in on landmarks, townships and any other points of interest without ever bombarding us. nd the beauty of it being a private tour was that we could really do what we wanted and didnt have to fit in with anyone elses schedule. At Stellanbosch we got about an hour to look around and then we headed to our first winery. We then drove on to a second one near Paarl, and then drove to Franschoek where we stopped for a browse and a lovely lunch. Jamie even filled us in on where not to eat after some of her previous guests got food poisoning in one particular cafe there! Then we went to one more winery where they did wine and cheese which was a real find and our favourtie visit of the trip. It was a wonderful day we thoroughly enjoyed. The second trip was to Cape Penninsula and again Jamie picked us up early and we made a couple of stops to some really cute little towns along the way before going to the Peninsula. It was a really windy day, so it was hard to see the difference between the two oceans, but none the less it was a great experience and Jamie was wonderful taking pictures for us and telling us about all the widllife in the park. We had lunch at the two oceans restaurant, while the food was good the service was very peculiar so I wouldn't recommend it but that was nothing to do with Jamie or PG Tops.If you are going to Cape Town and looking for a private tour I couldn't recommend Jamie and PG Tops highly enough it was really wonderful."

She even found a way for us to visit Robben island on the day we arrived. Now for our tour guide, Rudi. He was so fantastic, personable, knowledgeable, and just an overall pleasure to be with. Basically, he took care of all our needs, including walking us into our hotel which he wasn't responsible for. He was both flexible and kept us on schedule without ever feeling rushed. He even took us on a tour of the botanical gardens. My only regret was that we couldn't spend more time in Cape Town and more time with Rudi. Without any hesitation whatsoever, I highly recommend PG TOPS TRAVEL."

I booked the tour because with a short trip to Cape Town I wanted to be able to see and experience as much as possible and PG Tops did not disappoint. Our guide was Rudi and I have to thank him for his laid-back, relaxing atitude and great sense of humour! I am also grateful for his extensive knowledge and travel tips. Our trip was on the first day and he was extremely helpful in recommending places to eat/see, as well as guiding us in the places that we should be more careful in/avoid. It was a fantastic experince and I would recommend PG Tops to anyone who has not experienced this part of the world before. When I return to cape Town agaian, I will not hesitate to use their services again. Thank you."

Our guide for 4 days, Rudolf van Rensburg, deserves 6 stars. He was accommodating to an elderly couple that travelled with us from Ireland. Everything went as planned, everyday on time and he really made our Cape Town visit a memorable experience, even for me as a South African. All in all I can recommend PG Tops Travel and Day Tours to anyone that requires a guide to show them the best of Cape Town and if you want a specific guide, ask for Rudolf. If we ever we plan to bring other international friends to South Africa we will definitely make use of their services again and we have already recommended them to our friends. Al wat ek kan se, is baie dankie aan PG Tops Travel and Day Tours, maklik die beste geld wat ek aan 'n vakansie gespandeer het. Rudolf, jy het verseker die Iere se harte gesteel. Sofie, baie dankie vir die reelings, dit was alles perfek.As they say in Gaelic, Gurbh a maith aguit !! (Thank you very much)."

Both guides were good company and informative.Both trips focused on wildlife, as we had said that was one of main interests. So we saw penguins at both Betty's Bay and Boulder's Beach. The whale boat was run by Dyer Island Cruises and we got really close to some whales, as well as seeing some seals at Dyer Island. Because the sea was a bit choppy, the trip took longer than expected, and we only just got to Betty's Bay before it closed. If the weather is a bit rough, I'd recommend asking for seasickness tablets, as one or two people were sick. The Peninsula trip was really pleasant, but watch out for baboons at Cape Point, especially if your are female and carrying food.All the organisation went really smoothly, so I am happy to recommend PG Tops for these personalise tours."

Our guide was Godfrey and I couldn't be more happy with having him bringing us around the cape for the day. Godfrey collected us on time and gave us a real understanding of the area and greater south Africa. He was very relaxed and we felt totally comfortable for the day. The tour around the cape hit a lot of great sites and since we had the personal touch we were able to get in and out of places a lot easier. I would totally look at PG Tops tours again for any touring needs."

We had originally arranged an all day wine tour with PG TOPs but due to a mix up by our hotel, we accidentally had a wine tour on the day we were supposed to have a Cape Point tour. It couldn't have worked out better! PG TOPs was more than accommodating and changed our wine tour to an all day Cape Point tour, and the weather cooperated, too, by being perfectly clear, sunny, and warm. Our guide, Yolanda, was very personable, and took us to several sites (such as a locals' market in Hout Bay) that weren't filled with bus tours. Yolanda arranged a table reservation at Two Oceans and out table was waiting when we arrived from our hike from the Cape of Good Hope up to Cape Point. The tour was timed well, and it ended just when we expected it to. We can't think of any other tour we've taken that would rank more highly than our tour with PG TOPs. You won't be disappointed, either."

I set up the details with Caren who was very responsive to all the questions I had and I had a lot! Our driver was waiting for us when we arrived at the airport and our transfer to the hotel went well.Our full-day tour was scheduled for Robben Island in the morning and the Winelands in the afternoon. PG Tops\u2019 driver, Bianca, picked us up at the hotel on time. There were four of us and we were very comfortable in the van. Bianca brought us to the pier for the ferry to Robben Island and purchased our tickets for us. Unfortunately, the ferry was cancelled after we boarded so we called PG Tops and our driver came back for us. Bianca had several suggestions as to how to spend the morning and we opted for a visit to the District Six museum before going to the Winelands which was no problem for Bianca. She even made a quick stop at a pharmacy for us. We then picked up our guide (and owner), Peter, who was fantastic. He is a walking encyclopedia on the history of South Africa as well as more current affairs and on wines of the region. His selection of wineries for our tasting tour and lunch was excellent.We would not hesitate to use PG Tops again. They were flexible with our arrangements and their service and tour content was excellent."

It is simply her personality. The result was we got a sense of the history and evolution of Cape Town and its culture from a real local, whose first language was Afrikaans. We saw the peninsula, Signal Mountain, downtown, the penguins, with someone who was honest about shortcomings of the area, but had an undeniable love for the area and country. If one wants to mix fun with a tour, and end up with a real sense of the area, Yolanda and her company will be a great bet. And this from a couple of seniors!"

Deion heard that and picked out some excellent wineries where we had private tastings.

Yolanda and Jamie brought us to Franschhoek and Stellenbosch for some wine tasting and we did a bike tour to 2 wineries. On our last day, Yolanda took us around the city and gave us a brief history of Cape Town and she saw us off to Robben Island. Due to the weather, our visit to Table Mountain was cancelled. This gives us a reason to go back next time. They also made sure we got reservations to the restaurants we wanted to eat in and they also took care of our transfers to and from the place. They were always prompt and they accommodated all our requests even with short notice. I recommend PG Tops. Their tour guides are very friendly, warm and funny. There wasn't a dull moment with them. They were also such good sports because they all agreed to do some jump shots and silly photos with us. Thank you Yolanda, Jamie and Rudy. We had a lot of fun with all of you and we are looking forward to seeing you all again soon."

From the first contact, during the period of planning, from the Organisation to the warm welcome at the Airport, from the perfection of the different tours to the invoicing, from the recommendation of fantastic Restaurants to the selection of Wineries, from the explanations to the safe journey across the beautiful landscape everything was perfect. We spent 7 days on 6 different tours with Pieter, Sophie, Yolanda and Ralph. Each of them an Expert, Colleague, Entertainer and Guide through a versatile Country with multicultural People. Apart from the flow of Tourist we discovered the best South Africa has to provide. (No possible without the Team of PG Tops Travel and Day Tours! Big value for reasonable rates. As a Family of 4 persons it is much more advantageous (Price, Flexibility, Individuality, Comfort) than with one of the big and expensive Tour-Organisations!We spent one of the best times in our life with the guys from PG Tops.

We stopped on route to Langa in District 6 and the history lesson began. Godfrey informed us he grew up in the Langa town ship and still lives there and his passion for this area shown through in the history lesson we received. We got to see a lot in the Township including a project where they make nice pottery, a preschool, a traditional pub, and different types of living areas and also got to interact with the people. It was very interesting to see the other side of Cape Town and I would highly recommend this tour. The highlight of this tour for my wife was the visit to the pre-school. Highly recommend this tour!"

Our tour guide though, definitely exuded an air of superiority when providing us with South African history and discussing the local people. We understand there is still some tension with the history but the way it was communicated, I found it almost offensive. She also made me feel bad about the way I was dressed, implying I wasn't dressed properly for the tour. We did have an amazing time though on the tour as it was personalized."

I found PG Tops thru tripadvisor and was hesitant to use a company without personally knowing anyone who used them. It was the BEST decision I made. We had Yolanda for 2 full days of touring and Roelf for another day. Spectacular guides. We had private guides before but Yolanda and Roelf were better than any we ever had. We got a tour of Winelands, Cape town area and the Penninsula tour. Roelf was even able to get us a tour of Langa the township at the last minute and it was one of the highlights of our trip. They were great about brining us to airport and picking us up. Very helpful in assisting to get tickets for activities we wanted on Robben Island and Table Mountain Vans were really comfortable too.Very informative, friendly and flexible\u2026I can not recommend them enough.

The only thing we missed was the trip up Table Mountain but then you can't control the weather, and whilst we could have gone on the Tuesday, the queues were horrendous so we'd have simply wasted a lot of time. We visited Stellenbosch and the winelands in close proximity with Pieter, and then Capetown and the southern area included yet another vineyard with Erica - not that I was complaining !! Both trips were relaxed and informative, aided by discussions of our own views and feelings on the general state of affairs of the country which I was interested in having lived in Zambia some years ago. I can honestly say I found Pieter and Erica very easy to talk to and they maintained a relaxed but professional attitude throughout. I felt it was worth paying the extra against a bigger tour company for the simple reason we're not going to be visiting the area in the near future so make the most of it with the personal service."

We booked two full day tours - the Cape Peninsular and Cape Town City Tour which included Table Mountain. Our tour guide for both was Roelf who was excellent - very interesting, knowledgeable and friendly, it was a real pleasure to meet him.Both tours were excellent. We got to learn so much about the Cape Town area. The tours are flexible and paced to your own choosing, Roelf even managed to fit in a bit of wine tasting for us at the end of one day. The Peninsular Tour is a great trip with a fabulous coastline. Without having to drive you can really take it in and still be able to stop where you choose. The tour of Cape Town included a walk around the City centre (the main City centre is not that big so it was not a big trek). This was a really fun option and it was really enjoyable to able to walk around and get to understand so much about what you are visiting. Thank you to PG Tops for a fantastic time."

Our guide Rudi was a very nice chap and tried his best to listen to our interests and choose the winery's accordingly.We went to Fairview first, which is commercially run, and at the slightly cheaper end of the market. You can taste goats cheese as well, which was very good. A popular wine in the UK, Goats do Roam, is produced here. The grounds are nice, complete with goats, and the staff were helpful and knowledgeable.As particular red wine lovers, we went next to Rust En Vrede, which I don't think is a usual stop on the tour. The wine was more expensive, but really very nice. They have a restaurant there which looked inviting, but we were already booked to eat elsewhere.For lunch we went to the Graff estate. The restaurant has fantastic views, but we thought the attitude of the staff was a bit snotty. Finally we went to the Warwick estate, but we were not keen on their wine, and the service was very poor.We did buy wine at 3 of the estates to be shipped back to the UK. Its worth noting that there is a huge variance in how efficient each estate is in making this transaction straightforward (or not). We would have expected the process to be streamline !If you are considering a wine tour, it is well worth doing research in advance to identify which specific winery's may be to your taste. There's a huge variety.Our second tour was the following day when we went horse riding on the beach at Noordhoek. This was just something I wanted to do having seen horses on the beach during our last visit to Cape Town. The beach and sea are beautiful and deserted, so a lovely way to spend a morning. Our driver, Joe was very pleasant, although I'm not sure it was necessary, as he just spent 5 hours in the car waiting for us.All communication with PG Tops was dealt with very efficiently by Sofie - thank you :-)"

Rudi is a gem of tour guide and you should ask for him if you are considering a private tour."

He picked us up right on time at our hotel in Capetown and took us to the wine country and shopping the first day and a tour of the peninsula the next day. We toured two wineries, had a great lunch at one, and when we were on the way back to the hotel, my friend mentioned that she would be interested in some jewelry. Roelf knew of a wholesale diamond store, who stayed open late for us. Yes, she did buy a gorgeous ring! The next day was also fabulous. Roelf recommended an excellent seafood restaurant right on the water, where we ate fresh fish and prawns until we were ready to burst! Roelf was very knowledgable about the area and patiently answered all our questions, stopped for pictures, etc. We would not hesitate to recommend PG Tours to anyone."

My wife and I spent 6 days in Cape Town with Yolanda who showed us around and went the extra mile every day to make sure we discover the nicest parts of her city and culture. Yolanda has been extremely friendly, very knowledgeable and really attentive to all our needs and expectation. She really took care of all details during our stay and this has been, by far, our best guided tour ever!I used other companies in the past to do the Peninsula tour, whales watching or visit the vineyards and none of the previous experiences I have had so far has been as good as what we experienced with PG Tops. They are actually selecting their partners and the places you visit so that you consistently enjoy the best available options. We'll for sure come back in Cape Town in a near future and we'll of course ask PG Tops, and in particular Yolanda, to guide us again. Thank you so much for this fantastic week in a fabulous town!"

Although I've never used a tour company on any of our travels, I decided it was best to hire someone for this trip. It was the best thing I could have done, and I really think I found the best tour guide for the job. Yolanda was fantastic! She is young, vibrant, and excited to share all she knows about the area and the country with her guests. The best part for me was she had spent a year as an au pair in the past, so she really got kids- was able to talk with them and explain things to them in a way that they understood and found exciting. I feel like the boys learned a lot, and I did too! She was able to make it interesting for all of us. In talking with her it seems she could really tailor make a tour that anyone, young or old, with any interests, could be very happy with. She loves her job and it really shows. It was a whirlwind three days, in which we saw cheetahs, whales, seals, penguins, ostriches, along with any other wild life that crossed our paths. We hiked Lion's Head (definitely a highlight), walked from Cape Point to the Cape of Good Hope (beautiful!) and went blokarting. We had a fantastic city tour and really loved the castle portion especially. We were also able to drive around much of the area and take in some really incredible scenery. I cannot say enough good about Yolanda and the company. They were very easy to work with, reasonably priced, and provided three great days for us! She made traveling with three kids super easy- I didn't have to think about where we were going or what to see, or where we were going to eat. All the information she was able share with us really enhanced our experience in Cape Town. Would recommend to anyone."

I started with an email and corresponded with Bianca, who was very responsive and informative. After several rounds of emails, we finally settled on an itinerary two days of touring in and around Cape Town. For my husband and me, our must-sees were Table Mountain (husband) and Robben Island (me). I also wanted to get a sense of the city and go out to the winelands.Rudi picked us up on time on a morning with terrible weather. Table Mtn was a no-go that morning, and I wasn't due to go to Robben Island until the afternoon. So Rudi improvised and took us through the Waterfront where we did a little shopping and then brought us to Camp's Bay so we could see the other side of the mountain. Ultimately we had some lunch before I was due to catch the ferry to Robben Island, and then he would whisk my husband up the mountain, so he could get that in. My husband tells me that Rudi actually waited to see me board the ferry before they left for the mountain. When I returned from Robben Island, Rudi was waiting for me just as planned.Due to a scheduling change, my husband could not join in for any of our 2nd day of touring, so Rudi had the dubious honor of being my personal guide for the day. He walked me through the Castle of Good Hope and then drove me out to the winelands. He was such a trooper watching me taste wines all day. I had a fabulous day and much of that is due to his professionalism, great information and good humor. I would strongly recommend that anyone looking for a personal and custom tour of Cape Town and its surrounding areas to contact PG Tops. You will not be disappointed. I hope we'll be back to South Africa again, and they'll be tops on my list."

What amazed me most about my PG experience was that he was able to create a super-unique experience that I know I wouldn't be able to create for myself. I told Pieter that I wanted to do some bike riding, preferably at Cape Point. I realize now that biking up Cape Point would be silly / impossible... but Pieter figured out a way to accommodate my love for biking in an unbelievable way. He used his contact network to create a biking experience for us on Chapman's Peak, a super scenic windy road hugging the mountainous cliffs of Cape Town. For anyone who's been to South Africa, you probably know that Chapman's Peak is an amazing drive. Now imagine that same experience, except you're on a bike! It was incredible and it took my breath away. The entire time, Pieter and his bike rental contact made sure that we were safe, and we were able to do something that probably <1% of tourists do. (In case you're wondering - there aren't bike rental shops around this location - he had to get these bikes brought in!). It was the favorite activity BY FAR for everyone in my travel group - he made me look like a trip planning genius!Beyond all this - Pieter's awesome for the depth of knowledge regarding his country. He walked us through South Africa's history, patiently entertaining my very curious and inquisitive travel group. (We had millions of questions!). You can have a standard tour experience with other vendors, but you really get more with PG. Totally recommend! :-)"

Our last day in Cape Town Godfrey took us on the Township tour. As spectacular as the Cape Town and environs tours were, the Township tour was equally moving and should not be missed. Godfrey was very sensitive to our nervousness that we didn't want to bee seen as gawkers, but rather that we wanted to learn about the townships, how they came about, and how they are evolving. He took us to his home and neighborhood and we thank him for that."

            "review": "Thank you PG tops for an amazing experience!. Just got back from South Africa and loved our time in Cape Town. I think Cape Town on its own is an exceptional place and we would've loved our time anyway, but having great guides to accompany us to the different sites was definitely a bonus I did not expect. Our guides from PG Tops were absolutely AWESOME--not only are they were well informed about the places we visited, but they were very personable and friendly. One huge difference I noticed from guides i've had in the past is that they are not just trying to get their shift done and wanting to get their time with us out of the way; they were hospitable and let us have our time at all the places we visited so that we could appreciate each spot they took us to. We didn't feel rushed once. Me and a group of 5 other girlfriends spent 4 1/2 days in Cape Town; 4 of which we used PG Tops to guide us. Day 1 - Our guide, Godfrey, met us at our hotel and we started the day driving through District 6 and visiting Langa township. We spent about 3-4 hours within the township touring a home shared by 3 families, visiting a preschool, and visiting a local bar within the area. Living in the township himself, we felt we got a better idea of the life there and appreciated that. It was as if someone was inviting us into their home so that we could have a glimpse of the life there. We were supposed to go to Table Mountain on this day also, but because of the rain, it was closed. Godfrey improvised by showing us some other sites in Cape Town and more than made up for our missing Table Mountain that day. He was great. Day 2 - For the rest of our Cape tours, Roelof guided us, and he was wonderful. I was amazed by his people skills and knowledge being as young as he is. We spent this day doing the Cape Peninsula tour. The Cape seaside is one of the most picturesque coastal areas i've ever seen. We spent the whole day stopping along all the different points, from Cape of Good Hope to Capepoint to Boulder beach in Simon's town. Day 3 - Shark diving. We arranged our shark cage diving through PG Tops who works with Marine Dynamics. It's about a 2-3 hour drive from Cape to Gaanesbai but we thought it was well worth it. Well maybe 2 of the 5 ppl I travelled with didn't think so, as they got seasick and didn't feel up to doing the actual dive. I'll write about Marine Dynamics and the dive on another review, but they were great. Day 4 - Robben Island and the wine country in the afternoon. Because it was rainy or didn't fit into our schedule the other 3 days, Roelof got us to Table Mountain on this morning. It was foggy but as it's one of the top sites there, glad we were able to go up. From here, he took us to the port for Robben Island. That was a great visit. He dropped us off at the port and met back with us when we arrived back. Roelof gave us time to grab a bite and shop around the waterfront, and then it was a mad dash to the wine country. Unfortunately, we didn't get to go to Stellbosch which was the plan. Most of the places stop doing tastings at about 5, and because we spent a little more time shopping and made the stop at Table Mountain, we wouldn't have gotten there on time. However, Roelof did a great job of improvising and getting us to a nice spot in Paarl. 4 of the 6 of us don't drink, and when I let Roelof know this earlier in the day, while 2 of us tried the wine, he set it up so the the other 4 could have a \"chocolate\" tasting which they seemed to enjoy. He was also going to take us to cheese tasting spot, but because we wouldn't have gotten there on time as we were already tasting our chocolate and wine, he surprised us with cheese after our tastings, that he rushed to get at some point while we were doing our tastings. It was a perfect end. We reached Cape in the evening and one of the girls wanted to drive by Camp's Bay. I didn't think we had time and thought it was definitely way past the time he needed to spend with us, but he was so accommodating that he said he could drive by there and he did. At the end of our trip we were sad to say goodbye to him, it was as if we had another friend spending those days with us. I have travelled quite a bit, mostly visiting sites w/o guides, but of all the guided tours i've had in the past, this surpassed my expectations. I will definitely recommend PG Tops to anyone I know visiting South Africa in the future."

I was extremely happy with the tour guides from PG Tops. Each tour guide was knowledgeable, friendly, accomodating, and easy to understand. I have travelled extensively thoroughout the world, and I have to say that the tour guides from PG Tops are the best that I have encountered. Prior to our trip I exchanged emails with Pieter, who helped build out the itenarary for my friends and I. Pieter was great in answering all of our questions and building out a great itenarary. Our tour guides in Capetown were Godfrey and Roelof. Godfrey was our tour guide for the first day in Cape. He took us to Langa township, along with other sites. Godrey did a great job! We felt safe going into the township with him. He answered all our questions, and was super friendly and knowledgable!The next three days, we explored the wonders of Capetown with another guide named Roelef. Roelef was amazing! I was very impressed with his knowledge and people skills. My entire group liked him. He was informative, and kept us all laughing. Also easy to understand and made the stories interesting. He was very accomodating to our group. Three days with a person can be a lot sometimes, but he just blended in with our group. He definitely exceeded our expectations!The tour guides made sure we saw everything we had planned and adjusted our planned itenarary based on the weather and our requests. We had an awesome time thanks to the knowledgable, dynamic and fun staff from PG Tops.Thank you guys for everything :)"

It was a treat to have PG Tops and Rudi take care of us! We may never tour on our own again!The first day we took the Wine Lands tour. One of our foursome is a car enthusiast and I suggested we visit a car museum in Stellenbosch that I had read about. Rudi was glad to customize our day for us so we went and loved it.The second day we went on the peninsula tour. What a wonderful day...until one gentleman is our group fell and needed to see a doctor. Rudi quickly drove us to the emergency room in Cape Town. Rudi was so kind and helpful and stayed right with us. He made a very stressful time much more bearable and we still made it to Table mountain after 8 stiches!We would definitely recommend PG Tops! Yolanda was helpful and punctual with replies as we made reservations. Rudi was knowledgeable, punctual, considerate and an all round nice guy!"

            "review": "Best Decision Ever. Myself , my wife and my daughter recently visited Cape Town for the first time. We decided on a private tour guide due to all the conflicting reports on how dangerous [or not] Cape Town is. Let me firstly say that we had no trouble in Cape Town, or anywhere else during our visit to South Africa. It is no more or less dangerous than most other destinations.  Right from the start we knew we had made the right decision in our choice of tour guides. Yolanda is bubbly, friendly and a wealth of knowledge on Cape Town and South Africa. We got a great feel for the country ,the people and the history. Yolanda could not do enough to make our trip enjoyable and gave us advice on restaurants, shopping and other travel destinations apart from Cape Town. A self confessed \" Cape Town Snob\" Yolanda showed us a side of the city we never would have seen on our own. And the township tour she organised for us with Godfrey was my daughters highlight. This is a must for anyone visiting South Africa and Godfrey, a resident of Langa Township himself,really knows his stuff. So if you are considering a trip to Cape Town I highly recommend the team at PG Tops, they will really ensure you thoroughly enjoy your South African adventure."

Working with Betsy (BJAdventures) and Pieter of PGTops, my daughter Agatha and I had an absolutely wonderful time on the peninsula. We were so lucky to have Pieter as our guide for 3 full days - which spanned hiking and rock climbing to the top of Lion's Head to a spectacular tour of the Cape of Good Hope to great wine/beer and chocolate tastings in the Winelands and beautiful Stellenbosch and of course....time with the Cheetahs, a particular favorite for Agatha.Important to me is having a guide who understands and respects his/her traveling clients and works with me to fulfill our greatest expectations. Pieter excelled at understanding our interests and abilities, was flexible to altering plans, if desired--while always being on time. Being a history buff, I especially appreciated the many discussions we had regarding the history of Cape Town - its people, its culture and its role in modern day society, globally and nationally. Thanks Pieter...and thanks to my dear friend and travel advisor - Betsy (BJAdventures). Paulette (and Agatha)"

Rolf collected my mother and I in an impeccably clean BMW, what a treat and whisked us up to Table Top Mountain for the first cable car at 8.00 am. We were lucky to have a beautifully clear day. What a view, it was very fresh, my mother thought chilly, so make sure you wear layers and take a scarf.We then set off to Stellenbosch to visit the wineries Ernie Els gets a big tick, lunch at Delaire Graff gets a big tick and the tasting at Rustenberg, although the wines were delicious, particularly their Cabernet, the service was not a patch on the Ernie Els experience. This was a recommendation from PG Tops and an experience not to be missed. We wished we'd had time to return for their cheese platter in the late afternoon paired with their delicious Shiraz or Big Easy Bordeaux blend - next time! What was nice about the tour was it was designed for 'us', compared to being in a large group getting on and off a shuttle bus or SUV. If we wanted to stay longer somewhere, or stop along the way we could. Rolf our driver was telling us, that the onwer, Pieter's philosophy is to provide the guests with a memorable experience, in order to do that Rolf called himself a 'knowledgeable driver', he knew the answers to most of our questions, and pointed out sites along the way.It was a long day for us from 7.30 am to 6.00 pm, and although we didn't have the time to spend walking the streets of Franschoek at the end of our day, Rolf made sure he drove past the sites and pointed things out for us to experience next time.Pieter and Rolf, thank you, as you know I have already recommended you to friends who have also toured with you in Apirl, and they are also recommending you to their friends.So, until we meet again.Thank you.Michelle & SonjaMargaret River & Mandurah (Western Australia)Travelled April 2013"

We had an incredible picnic lunch at Hartenberg, which remains one of the top highlights of our honeymoon and great wine tastings at Warwick, Fairview and Grande Provence. The Cape Point tour was excellent and Roelf again provided us with a very personal, comfortable and fun day exploring the small fishing villages along the route to the Cape Point, the penguins at Boulders Beach and sending us on our way for a fun hike to the point, where he met us at the top with some much needed water bottles. :)After two amazing days, we decided to add on a township tour with Godfrey who was another great tour guide. Incredibly knowledgable about the history of Capetown and the Langa township that we visited. A HUGE thank you to PG Tops for giving us such memorable experiences in your beautiful city.

Thankfully, Pieter was just the man to get our hearts pumping and legs burning! Our first afternoon with him had us hiking up Table Mountain on one of its more strenuous routes. Whenever we did take a break, Pieter and Roelf were excellent raconteurs, telling tall tales about the history of their great city. They timed the hike so that we arrived at the top close to sunset - as it was a clear day, the views were simply incredible.On our second day with PG Tops, we spent the morning downhill mountain biking both in Tokai Forest, and from the top of Chapman's Peak. We then did our best to replenish spent calories at a local eatery - mission accomplished!We were very impressed with how PG Tops catered to our specific needs - it's obvious that they possess a wide body of knowledge about the area, and that they truly enjoy delivering top-class service.

Also, I must mention that Pieter and his team were a great resource in helping us plan our time in Cape Town and recommending some great day trips -- Cape Point & Peninsula Tour; and a visit to the winelands.

I recommend this tour to anyone traveling to Cape Town...and make sure you request Yolonda, she's amazing!"

I have recently come back from South Africa and spent a week with Roelf and Tony showing us the sites of Cape Town, they were always on time, helpful, polite and did such an incredible job and most of all I had an absolute blast with them! Every question answered that we wanted to know about the city and even at 5am pick ups Roelf was extremely accomodating and friendly. We went shark diving, Robben Island, Table Moutain, 3 wine tours and Cape Point. I can't speak highly enough of this company and have already recommended to a friend who will be booking a trip next year after my rave review. Thank you so much everyone at PG Tops I had the best time and will be back very soon :)"

I've just come back from a trip to CT where our group of seven was incredibly lucky to be shown around by PG Tops tours - and let me tell you they live up to their name!We did Shark diving, Cape Point, Table Mountain, Winelands and various transfers and all were fantastic! The whole team at PG Tops from Pieter who owns the company and was amazing at helping us to plan our trips with great advice and patience to Yolanda who stayed in touch from the office with confirmations etc and Roelf and Tony who took us out on our tours. They are knowledgable and informative while also being great fun and completely flexable and real value for money. I've done all of these tours in CT before so I have something to compare against and they really are in my opinion the best - to not use them would really be your loss! I'll be reccomending them to anyone I know going out to CT and will definatley be calling them again the next time I'm in town. Thanks guy's - we had a ball!"

We had planned to do a Peninsula tour the first half-day, followed by a half-day winelands tour the next day. We had anticipated a relaxing, sedate, pleasant tour of the area, but what we got was so much more! Tony picked us up around 8 am on the first day, and drove us down the coast, stopping at a few popular tourist destinations, but focusing on more interesting and less well-known spots. We saw so many beautiful places along the way, including Clifton Bay, Chapman's Point, Long Beach, Buffel's Bay, and of course the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Point. We had a wonderful sushi lunch at the restaurant at Cape Point, overlooking the sea. Saw the penguins and a few other cute little coastal towns along the way. Tony was a knowledgeable, fun, energetic guide, and the conversation flowed easily for the many hours we spent in the van. It quickly became apparent what one of his passions was, shark cage diving. We discussed it for quite some time, and decided that we absolutely had to do this instead of driving around the winelands. Tony contacted Pieter and we were able to set it up for the following day. We appreciated the flexibility and were very excited for our new adventure. Tony picked us up at 4 am the next morning and we set off for the 2.5 hour or so drive to Gansbaai. By this time, we were laughing and talking like old friends, so we enjoyed the drive and the sunrise over the mountains was beautiful. The shark cage diving excursion was booked with Marine Dynamics. We really liked this company because of their focus on education, conservation, and research. Several volunteers and researchers were on board, and much of the company's profits go toward those ends. This was truly an amazing experience! We rode about 15-20 minutes out in very rough waters, until we reached shark alley. I will review the excursion separately, but I will just say that we had several close encounters with GIANT great whites, saw several southern right whales, and Geyser island, which is referred to as \"seal island\" or \"McDonald's\" for sharks... This was one of the highlights of our entire trip, one that we will never forget!After warming up from our time on the boat, Tony took us on a mini-wine tour, and we had lunch at Creation winery. The tasting menu was OK. Some of the canapes were a bit dry and the service was not great, but the wine was exceptional and the company enjoyable.We highly recommend PG Tops, particularly Tony. We felt like we got an insider's tour of the peninsula and VIP treatment on the shark cage dive. We passed giant tour buses full of tourists, and were so thankful that we had our own personal guide rather than a canned, scripted tour of the area with 50 other people."

He gives you all the information you need/want and delivers it with a big smile and an infectious laugh and always has another joke to tell. Not only did Pieter give us a good history and overview of Cape Town and how it was established and grew but he also gave us a lot of insight into culture and social history of the people. He asked us questions to find out where our interest and knowledge lay and tailored the information to our interest. Pieter also organised the stops and route he took us taking into account where and when the large tour bus groups would likely be, and therefore we avoided long queues and obscured views! His recommendation for a lunch stop was spot on and we enjoyed good food with a beautiful view and great company.From start to finish the day was fun and I highly recommend PG Tops - you won't regret it."

Cannot say enough good things about Pieter, we spent two days with him on a guided tour of Cape Town and the surrounding areas, and each day was jam-packed with wonderful adventures! Pieter was a breeze to deal with and so flexible, we got his name from a coworker only a few days before we were heading to CT and luckily he had space for us, so a few emails later we were all sorted. We spent a wonderful day in wine country and one doing the peninsula drive, and I can't imagine how they could've been better. His knowledge of the area is top notch, but what really made this trip such a pleasure is his attention to detail and getting all the small things right. He struck a great balance of giving us some options on stuff to do, but without making it seem like we were doing all the work, and he was flexible as our plans changed (or the weather) so we always had something on tap next. The most important thing is that he's just a great guy, someone you will enjoy spending time with (as are his colleagues I'm sure) and I have a lot of respect for the fact that he just started this business up himself and cares so deeply about it. Highest compliment I can give is that I never felt over the course of two days like we were on a guided tour, it truly felt like we had a friend in town who was showing us around. Great job Pieter, thanks for all the great memories, and we hope to see you on another trip to CT soon!Mike&Alison"

We are 3 young professionals from Canada working in Johannesburg for 2 months and thus we only had one long weekend to spend in Cape Town. Not only was PG tours able to provide us with a private tour (in a swanky BMW) which hit all the spots on our must-see lists but as Roelf got to know us he made recommendations for additional stops which he thought we would enjoy. Our guide was fully prepared with contact information for all the tourist hot spots (and a number of local places too) to ensure that our tour was flawless. Roelf was extremely knowledgeable about pretty much everything and he was fun to hang out with as well! By the end of our tour we definitely felt as though we had made a new friend.

Pieter filled both of these roles! A great start for me was the addition of a coolbox with water and a couple of cans of beer for the journey! This was undertaken in a spacious air conditioned van and as it was just me and my partner, we had plenty of space to enjoy!The tour itself covered everything we wanted to see from the natural wonders of Cape Point, Cape of Good Hope, the penguins and Boulders Beach to the markets and shops in Simonstown and of course the vineyard tours. A very well rounded tour covering everything that we wanted to do with a good variety to stop us getting bored. We felt relaxed and not hurried but also able to make our own decisions about how we wanted the day to go, with tips and suggestions from Pieter. Finally to add that a big part for us booking with Pieter was the speed of his responses to emails and also the Website appearance. Both very professional. The website is informative but also lends a bit of fun to the tours and services offered. One evening in the UK I sent an email at about 1830 UK time (1930 in SA) which was responded to within about 30-40 minutes. I was not expecting anything until the next day but to have the answers straight away just made it one less thing to do before the holiday.

On both occasions, Yolande was punctual, fun to be with and a mine of information. Importantly, too, the mini bus was clean and well-maintained.  PG Tops is a small company with the personal touch. An advantage of this is that staff can really get to know their clients and flexibility can be built into trips to suit the needs and interests of those travelling. This is a feature usually lacking with larger tour companies who are tied to rigid schedules.  We will most definitely be booking this company again."

Our goal was to visit as many \u201cmust see\u201d sites while having some down time to simply enjoy the environment. We rented apartments on the V&A Waterfront, which put us in a prime location for visiting the shops and fabulous restaurants. We were also in close proximity to the convention center which was hosting the Annual Cape Town International Jazzfest - it was fabulous. With that said, we feel as though we made some really good choices. But I must add that selecting PG Tops and staff was our best choice by far. The owner, Pieter Geldenhuys, worked with us to build a two-day itinerary that not only kept us on budget, but covered the \"must sees\" we requested. For example, my group visited Table Mountain with the opportunity to ride the cable cars up the mountain, District 6 Museum which provides in-depth information on South African apartheid, as well as a 2-hour walking tour of a township, meeting the people, talking to students and witnessing everyday life. The tour concluded with an authentic African meal at a local restaurant \u2013 what a surprise! We even had our own private entertainment. Great day!!! And big shoutout to Godfrey, our tour guide for the day. Godfrey speaks with an innate knowledge of the area, the people, and the mix of cultures. He is a kind man with expert familiarity. We could not have asked for more - thanks Godfrey! Also, special shoutout to Roelf who guided us on our Day 2 safari. Again, you can make your tour as adventurous as you dare - Pieter will make it happen. I strongly recommend PG Tops for all your tour needs. It is especially convenient to have their door-to-door pickup service along with the overall feeling of safety and comfort.Thanks Everyone!"

I travelled to South Africa for my brother in laws 40th birthday for a long weekend and we had our heart set on doing some deep sea fishing off Cape Point but as often is the case the sea was too rough for us to go out and we didnt fancy spending four hours feeling ill! Enter stage left Pieter Geldenhuys the owner of PG Tops to the rescue. The day was simply brilliant. Picked up in a smart air-conditioned vehicle complete with refreshments, Pieter set about asking us questions to see what made us tick so he could match the wineries to our personalities and interests which I thought was a great touch. We visited 3 (or 4, I forget!) vineyards, each of them stunning yet uniquely different. Pieter thought very carefully where to take us and nailed it each time as we had the full spectrum of experiences. From the beauty and tranquility of Solms-Delta, a vineyard with an intriguing history and the charismatic Leon to recount it, through to the opulence of the Provence vineyard with its distinctly french feel. All the wines (and food we had) were superb but Solms Delta was the standout for us simply for its authentic South African feel, history and the fact its set up as a trust so that the workers all benefit from its success. I bought 60 bottles there!In addition to the fabulous wine adventure, Pieter also asked us if there was anything else we wanted to do so he took us to a huge, vibrant, uniquely South African open air bar in a township. Hundreds of friendly people with their families enjoying one of the biggest BBQ come dances in a bar I am sure I will ever see. It was brilliant because it was real life. We ended what was a great day with Pieter dropping us off in Camps Bay for dinner. I really do highly recommend PG Tops because apart from Pieter and his team being genuinely nice, they put the effort in to make your day what you want, so there is not just one formula here and I thought it was great value for money especially since the day is tailored to your interests. Thanks again Pieter."

We debated on whether we should drive them ourselves our hire a touring firm to visit the wineries. (We knew which wineries we wanted to visit). The best decision we made was to hire PG Tops Travel and have Roelf as our driver/guide both times. Instead of watching the road and worrying about getting lost we were able to relax and view the gorgeous South African scenery and actually wine taste while visiting the many vineyards. The vehicle was nice and roomy, Roelf was always on time, friendly, informative and patient when we needed extra time. We lunched at Dieu Donne winery both trips where we had delicious food and the most amazing views. We would definitely enlist PG Tops Travel again and Roelf on any return visit!"

Peter helped me plan the daily itinerary -- city/table mountain, winelands, cape peninsula tours and pre-booked all tickets to robben island --and no question was left unanswered (and believe me I had lots - what with 3 young kids in tow)! The pacing of the whole visit was just right, kids were never too tired or too bored. From the time we were picked up in the airport to the day we left, we just had so much fun with Yolanda. My kids loved her! She was so patient and even went shell picking with them during the Cape Peninsula tour. All the stops we made, the restos, wineries, sights, animal farms (i.e. ostrich, cheetah, butterfly farms, etc) were fantastic. Yolanda offered honest practical tips and insights which we appreciated. In fact, my husband and I just sat back and enjoyed all the drives as Yolanda entertained us all. I can truly say that our stay in Cape Town was truly memorable because of Yolanda and Peter! I definitely recommend the PGTops team anytime!"

Our guide Yolanda was absolutely fantastic! During the course of the tour she filled us in on every imaginable aspect of history, geography, linguistics, politics, flora and fauna, and did it all with an infectious enthusiasm and an obvious love of her homeland and subject matter. By the end of the day, we felt like we had known her all our lives. From seals to ostriches to baboons to dassies to penguins, we saw it all, and we witnessed the most amazing scenery and vistas this side of Heaven. Not to missed: the hair-raising drive around Chapman's Peak set to Coldplay's \"Viva la Vida.\" At the climax of the song, we rounded the bend to take in the incredible panorama of Long Beach and Noordhoek. Positively mind-blowing. Also worth noting is the invigorating 45-minute trek from Cape of Good Hope to Cape Point, and the hike up to the lighthouse once you get there; the local crafts on display and for sale at Hout Bay; and the architectural charms of Simons Town. All in all, an amazing experience bordering of sensory overload in an absolutely beautiful corner of the world, and a memory that we will cherish for the rest of our lives! Hats off to Yolanda and Pieter!"

I was traveling with iKapa Tours and they booked me with Pieter for the weekend to do some hiking, visits to the botanical gardens and a visit to a Township. He was on time, and most accommodating for anything I wanted to do. We ended up having such a memorable weekend traveling around all of cape town and seeing things I wanted to see, which meant going outside of the box. We went to the Old Biscuit Mill and watched as the well-to-do South Africans ate their morning away eating delicious bites of wonderful organic fare. The place is a \"dont miss\" in my books if you plan to be in Cape Town for the weekend. For contract he then took me into town and had me walk through another market, much different than the bright and cheery biscuit mill. This market is the hot spot for the ethnic minded wanting to eat some amazing Indian and African dishes! The smells were to die for! It was dark in there but you could tell this is were flavor really comes through! Although I was alone, he made me feel very at home and was open in sharing all sorts of facets of South African life. We went for a walk along the waterfront where locals take their dogs, visited the botanical gardens, and took me on the most amazing Township tour I've ever been on. Pieter is loved by many and his partners in one of South Africa's largest townships, provided one of the most relevant and non-intrusive look at South Africans who live in Township. This isn't about pointing out a bunch of poverty stricken individuals but rather seeing how people living in these ares are working to create a better life for themselves. Its truly an amazing experience and nothing like I've seen with other outfits and I travel a lot. PG Tops is the only guiding company I will travel with from here on out. You simply can't go wrong with these guys!"

PG Tops gave us a fantastic day tour of Stellenbosch. We were guided through some of South Africa's finest vineyards. They were clearly strategically chosen to give a full flavor of all the unique and lovely vineyards that they area has to offer. The day was planned out with an array of vineyards and vino that was top notch. All we had to do was merely show up and the legwork was done for us. The vineyards selected were so original and unlike most of what we would see wine tasting in the US. Essentially, the landscape blows Napa out of the water, and PG Tops excelled at showcasing this region in its full glory. PG Tops arranged for a driver and was completely flexible with timing and drop off, exceedingly cordial, and just in general led us through a fabulous day. Highly recommended utilizing this company on your stay in Cape Town and surrounding areas!"

Pieter took us for lunch at a winery with spectacular food and a breathtakingly picturesque view. We were short on time, so he made sure we saw as many sights as we could in one day. We were able to go to seal island, see the penguins at Boulder's beach and hike up the Cape of Good Hope. We even managed to see a whale and her calf out of season. His prices are very reasonable as well for a private tour guide. For a few dollars more (not much), he got us a private transfer to and from Hermanus (a 2.5 hour drive)....not to mention, his BMW is much, much nicer and more comfortable than a big tour bus :) I highly recommend PG Tops."

Noel was fabulous - my friend and I had endless questions and Noel was very receptive. He gave us so much information about life in South Africa, including personal stories which made it all real. While we didn't see a single whale (during peak whale watching season), we thoroughly enjoyed our day because Noel took us to so many beautiful spots, making any stops we wanted and letting us decide how long we wanted to stay.

After multiple exchanges with Hank, he customized an agenda and developed a price that was extremely competitive and covered all the sites and things we wanted to see.Having taken a leap of faith based upon the interactions with Hank, everything went like clockwork and went flawlessly.Noel was our driver and guide for the week and made the trip so much richer because of his local knowledge and his personal experience growing up in South Africa.

He took us to the \u201clocal\u201d places and was patient as we stopped frequently to take stunning pictures.We used Cape Town as our base and took day trips that included a tour of Cape Town, trip to the South African wine country, a day to the Cape of Good Hope, and a visit to Cape Agulhaus. Noel had spots along the way for us to see and an appropriate commentary for the locale and history.This was the trip of a lifetime and was so much more enjoyable because of Noel\u2019s insight and care for his guests.

We travelled with my family (two adults and two children aged six and nine) to Cape Town in February this year and had been recommended Hank and the Ulungele Tours by my relatives. What a fantastic day tours we had with Hank and Noel! They helped us from the very beginning by planning a realistic and family friendly program for us and took into consideration all of our wishes. We experienced several tours with them: a Safari tour, a Wine tour and a tour to Cape of Good Hope. Even when we wanted to change our schedule in the middle of our trip, they manage to re-schedule according to our wishes. Both Hank and Noel are excellent guides and drivers and we have a lot of long and interesting conversations in the car with them, discussing everything from politics to everyday life matters. Love them! I will definitely book their services again if possible!"

He is extremely punctuational, knowledgeable, organized and professional. I used his services in July 2016 for a Day Tour of a Game Reserve Safari. I emailed him in May to book and he promptly answered the email in less than 24 hours. This was really reassuring since this was my first time traveling to South Africa, but I was also traveling solo. He picked us up right on time at 7am and drove 2.5hr to Inverdoorn Game Reserve. I was really happy to book this tour because it's not as crowded as the other one and you're only in a car of 12 people max. July is their winter so it was pretty cold especially with the open car concept. I wish I brought my ski mask. The safari part was amazing, since it's a game reserve the guides know exactly how many animals there are and you're kind of guaranteed to see all of them. I thought the tour was just the right amount of time because I was starting to shiver and was getting hungry. The lunch buffet was fantastic. Overall a memorable day. And honestly having Hank as our guide to the game reserve was fantastic. I learned so much about the history of South Africa. He is so eloquent in the way he speaks that I could've listened to him for hours. You will not be disappointed by booking through his company. He genuinely cares and strives to be"

Hank was in contact with us almost immediately to answer all of our questions. No pressure whatsoever - just a sincere interest in having us make the most of our time. Upon arrival at the Cape Town airport, our guide, Noel, met us for transport to where we stayed in downtown Cape Town, and that set the tone for the next couple of days. Laid back, genuinely friendly, and totally tuned in to our needs, he made us easily feel welcome and comfortable. Arriving early to pick us up the next morning, the first day was a tour to Cape Point with a number of stops along the way, and Noel shared with us his vast knowledge and experience from which we learned an incredible amount about the history, culture, geography, etc., of the region. It felt like the equivalent of a college course on wheels - fantastic! Noel was also extremely flexible, catering to our interests and learning from us, as well. The second day was spent in the wine region, and, after we shared with Noel a particular winery we wanted to visit, he made a point of looking for a similar winery the night before so we had two that met our needs. His selection of restaurants was outstanding and he freely gave us suggestions on other things to do and sights to see on our own. In short, we left Cape Town with an appreciation of the region (and of South Africa, in general) we would not otherwise have had and with a new friend. I can't say enough good things about Noel.We also had the pleasure to meet Hank, who picked us up for our return to the airport and who was equally friendly and helpful. I'm sorry we didn't get to know him better, but I'll let the previous reviews speak to his great nature. I highly recommend Ulungele Tours!"

We had booked with Ulungele Tours for our pick up from the airport, a Best of Cape Town Tour and then a drop off at the train station.Everyone was prompt and we felt well cared for. Our day tour was amazing with probably one of the best guides we have had in all our tours. Noel George - you were amazing with a great sense of humour and depth of knowledge. We had an amazing day. The great thing about booking a tour with Ulungele is that they cater to what you want to do - it's not set in concrete and it's private so you can do things in your time not someone else. The day tour takes you all around the Peninsula and the views are breathtaking. I am so pleased we booked this tour as we had a very short time in Cape Town and got to see everything. Hank the owner also provided guidance of the best options to see Table Mountain and Robbin Island without using guides - his advice was invaluable and we had not problems getting to see these. Booking was a breeze with prompt responses to my queries. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Ulungele Tours to other travelers."

Hank is incredibly knowledgeable about all things South Africa and answered a slew of questions that I had about tourism, the country itself, etc. He also obliged to stop at a mini mart so we could grab something to eat.

We were a group of 5 traveling to Cape Town/Garden Route, and we were planning on renting a car and driving ourselves; we had already made the hotel bookings months in advance. A few weeks prior to our trip, one of the folks in my group suggested finding a guide who can drive us around since it was going to be a short trip and we wanted to be able to maximize our time. I was skeptical that she would be able to find someone flexible enough to fit our schedule (we had the dates of when we needed to be in certain areas because of our hotel bookings) - but luckily, she found Ulungele Tours. Hank was quick to respond, which we appreciated. His company was able to accommodate our schedule/we weren't stuck with the off-the-shelf tours out there.However, I was still worried that it was too good to be true - i.e., we would have someone that just drives us around/not really act as a guide. Well, Hank turned out to be highly knowledgeable and was also very anxious to show us his country. Even when the rest of the group was feeling lazy/had no idea of where to go, Hank was still full of energy and wanted to make sure we saw the important sights (which we were thankful for). We actually considered it one of our best vacations EVER because of the experience. Note that this isn't your cookie-cutter tour; it's for folks that want something more intimate and personalized, with a guide that you can (and will want to!) hang out with."

For the entire trip, we were guided by the knowledgeable owner, Hank Daries, who is a most helpful professional, He is nice, polite, and an excellent driver who is a lot of fun. The trip was personalized, comfortable, and pleasant. i have absolutely nothing negative to say about our experience. Would I book with Ulungele again, you ask? Indeed, I would and will as we are returning to South Africa in March of 2017, and will need four airport transfers. Ulungele's is by far the smoothest part of any trip we have made in a long time. Hank is very dependable and a joy to be around: I can't possibly be more positive. See you in March Hank! Magi Aldridge, Breckenridge, Colorado, USA."

During the time driving, Hank told us about the areas, buildings and other points of interest along with history and current events. Hank consistently invited questions which we all had.

Our liaisons via email to book the tour were easy and Hank didn't require any payment until the day of our tour. He was professional, polite and definitely knows his stuff. He shared a wealth of information throughout the drive about the various places we went as well as South African history in general. Always offered to take our pictures and recommended places to see and do for the remainder of our holiday. I would book with Hank without hesitation!"

Initially we hired Hank simply to take us to an Safari park. Right before we flew to South Africa, Hank mentioned he was going to be near the Cape Town airport right about the time we were to land. He offered to pick us up and drive us to hotel in the center of Cape Town. In just a few minutes upon getting in his van, we were already impressed with him and decided to not just do the safari drive with him, but also a wine tour and Shark diving. Later we decided to also have him take us to Cape of Good Hope.He always picked us up on time and every place he took us to was impressive. Hank is from Western Cape and speaks fluent English and Afrikaans. He gave us a extensive overview of South African history and culture. So not only was touring with him fun, but also very educational.While the roads overall are decent in South Africa, there are some tight spots on some rights right along the coast. I think it is best to leave it so someone like Hank to do the driving and you just go and enjoy the view.If I go to Western Cape again (I want to!!), I definitely would book with Hank in a heartbeat!"

Hank was professional, knowledgeable, flexible and a good person to spend time with. He is fluent in English, a safe driver, experienced guide and really cares about his homeland and bio-diversity of the region.On both the inward and outward transfers, we had to make last minute changes due to the airlines, and Hank responded to our needs and was flexible with his schedule.When we finally arrived in Cape Town, Hank was waiting for us with a personalized sign.On the first day we did the Wine Lands Tour and on the second day the Cape Peninsula Tour. Both days were wonderful and we are happy we made the decision to use Hank. He provided a lot of interesting and useful information about Cape Town and the attractions/places we visited. His vehicle is clean, relatively new, and is comfortable to ride in. In addition to the key attractions, we made several stops where Hank gave us additional information about the history and background of the area, including the Drakenstein Correction Center, Afrikaans Language Monument, Franschoek and Stellenbosch. During the Wind Lands tour we visited four wineries, of which Laborie and Spier were our top two. Each morning Hank was waiting for us when we came out of the hotel.On the Peninsula Tour, I would skip the Ostrich Farm and Seal Island boat tour, unless this would be the first time each activity. If you have done these before, it offers nothing new. I recommend you spend the time at Cape Point, Cape Hopeand/or the Cape Point Light House.On the Wine Land tour just have a good time. The wine is very good and thankfully Hank was doing the driving."

I recently booked the personal 3 Night/4 Day Garden Route Tour with Hank Daries and Ulungele Tours for friends from Canada. Having been through dozens of reviews, I settled on Ulungele Tours and was not disappointed at all. Hank\u2019s knowledge of the Garden Route itself (he was born raised there) is phenomenal. He really makes every effort to explain the history behind each little town and the entire drive is a big classroom! For a first time visitor to South Africa, that is crucial.Hank is brilliant at communicating and you can send him dozens of mails until you are happy -- he will make excellent and knowledgeable suggestions and will tailor your trip to what you want. The accommodation and sights on the Garden Route were also fantastic. These may be the same that other operators use but again \u2013 Hank gives each site visit all he can \u2013 loads of information.Another great thing is that he is very very patient and really looks after his clients. He is really concerned that he is able to fit as much as possible into a day without it being \u2018 too much.\u2019 For elderly people this is a big bonus.He did the airport pick up and drop off and what every other reviewer has sais is so true --- 100% punctual. In fact, each time, he arrived earlier than expected.If you are planning a tour of the Western Cape and you want to take in any of the sights from Table Mountain to Cape Point to the Garden Route, Hank should be your number 1 choice. Absolutely no regrets!"

It was an amazing three days, we talked about every topic under the sun, from music to ethics and morals. Hank was a bit more expensive than other tour operators, but the second you start corresponding with him, you realize that it is worth it - he is responsive and answers all questions thoroughly. I am quite the traveler, so I had many itinerary options and was constantly double checking Hank's schedule - he was very patient with me and had everything under control - the six days went off without a hitch!

Hank arranged everything for us; he picked us up from where we were staying in Somerset West, he booked the accommodation at Inverdoorn, he arranged our safari for us and he drove us back afterwards. Admittedly I have written a number of 'excellent' reviews on TripAdvisor however I think Hank deserves his own category for being outstanding! Booking with him was incredibly easy and he responded to our emails straight away, he sent pictures and a website link to the game reserve and he was able to answer any questions we had. We had a 2-3 hour journey to get to the game reserve and all the way there Hank offered us general advice on where to go and what to do in Cape Town, he also offered safety advice and warned us to be careful in some areas of the city, he told us about what to expect from our safari and where we should sit on the jeep to get the best experience, he talked about the history of the towns that we went through and pointed things out to us, he also allowed us to take pictures when we wanted to. We stopped on a mountain pass and he took a fantastic picture of us and at this point he also told us about all of the wild animals that used to be in area. Just over half way through the trip we stopped in Ceres to get snacks (Hank suggested that this would be a good idea as we might not get another chance before we got to Inverdoorn). Hank was very kind and talked to the staff of the nearby Spur to see if I could use their 'facilities'! Unfortunately the public toilets in Ceres were out of order so I was very thankful that Hank offered to do this! When we arrived at the game reserve Hank once again did everything for us. He told us to take a seat outside on a comfortable sofa and wondered off to find someone to bring us our welcome drinks and go through a few things with us. Hank only left when we were checked in and being escorted to our chalet.The safari itself was absolutely fantastic and our chalet was perfect; Hank of course suggested that we should book the chalet and not the guesthouse as it was more appropriate for what we wanted out of the trip. I can't recommend Hank enough! He did absolutely everything for us and he just knew everything there was to know about Cape Town from what cars are most popular to what wine tours would be good to go on. Don't hesitate to book with him! THANK YOU HANK!"

Ulugele is a Zulu word which means everything will be alright, book anything with Hank Diaries and I can guarantee everything will be alright.I have recently returned from a 10 night stay in Cape Town with a party of 18, of which 16 were golfers. As one of the tour organisers I was responsible for the booking of accommodation, airport and golf transfers, golf bookings and excursions.While searching the web, by a massive stroke of luck I came upon Hank`s company. After many email exchanges trying to sort out all the details, it was apparent from the start, Hank was passionate about his company , country and most importantly for our group, his desire to iron out the smallest of details to minimise any problems for us. I could tell by email that Hank was a good guy.How wrong I was, he was far more than good, his punctuality, his knowledge (which gave us all a greater insight into the area from a geographical, history & social perspective) his Patience for an all male group of ages varying from 36 to 74, is far more than anything we expected or have experienced touring the world previously. The wine tour with lunch & trip to Cape Point were days we all will all remember. Hank and Gerard (his father in law), lunching with us on both days. While on the visit to Cape Point one of our party became very unwell, and with his usual calmness, Hank organised his return to Cape Town so the rest of the party could carry on with the rest of the day. All golf days went without a hitch and Hank & Gerard waited patiently while we had after game drinks. As is usual on our trips we have a presentation dinner at the end of the week and all the party were pleased that Hank & Gerard accepted our invitation to join us, such was the bonding of the group and these 2 fine men. As I said previously book this company, they will exceed your expectations A party of 18 came to Africa for a golf trip, but left, with making 2 very good friends.Thanks again Hank for making our holiday truly memorable.Frank"

The tour was prepared in negotiation, not by me I would add, with Hank the owner and managing director of Ulungele Tours in advance of the visit and the whole experience was absolutely first class, indeed faultless.We were greeted at the airport by Hank, a very easy going and personable individual, who transported our party to Camps Bay in two mini buses with trailers to accommodate the luggage and golf clubs. For the next ten days which included five days of golf most of which involved travel of between one and two hours nothing was too much trouble for Hank and his co-driver, his father-in-law Gerard. Collection was punctual on every occasion and no time pressures were ever encountered in respect of the return journey leaving complete flexibility for drinks and refreshments at the conclusion of the golf. The handling of sixteen sets of clubs daily was arranged by Hank on some occasions after being cleaned by the golf club staff. All we had to do was identify the bags and relax at the facilities.On two of the non-golf days we enjoyed two full day tours to both Cape Point and the Paarl/Franschhoek/Stellenbosch area taking in three wine tasting experiences at the respective estates, in addition to a superb lunch in Franschhoek. One example of the excellent approach to service can be described when one of our party was taken ill en-route to Cape Point which presented difficulties for the day tour itself. Hank was able to arrange a medical evacuation by recruiting a colleague from Cape Town to perform a repatriation trip by driving to Simon\u2019s Town and return with the incapacitated party whilst the remainder of the group continued to the Cape. There was of course a fee involved which in all the attendant circumstances I thought was very reasonable.As I have indicated previously nothing was too much trouble for Hank or any of his assistants who assisted in making a most memorable touring experience and I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this company to any reader."

As well as being very puntual and reliable Hank adds significant value to any tours with his insight and knowledge. This time he took us on a full day Winelands Tour to Paarl and Franschhoek and suggested some excellent vineyards and other stopping points that everyone enjoyed, including our two \"youngsters\" aged 25 and 23. He also took us on another 6 journeys in and around Cape Town - including a superb trip on a Thursday late afternoon/ evening to the Cape Point Vineyards in Noordhoek. This is a must do trip where lots of local businesses come along and sell a huge variety of hot and cold foods in a beautful setting overlooking the bay, with fantastic wines and beers available too.Hank is a thorough professional and also a really nice guy, all of our family were very impressed and I can't recommend him highly enough."

We had really enjoyed our trip, which we booked last minute to drive to Knysna and visit other stops along the way. We thought, initially that Hank was a really nice guy, with good knowledge of the region. We had good accommodations, too, which was great.If it were not for the very sour ending at this trip, the review would have been good (not great) - we had great tours in Cape Town and in the wine country, where the organizers made all the arrangements (details included). Hank missed the details a bit and each day, while I appreciated he was leaving room for flexibility, we were left \"figuring out\" lunch and dinner arrangements for the day - or spending far too long in one spot leaving less time for another. A few misses on lunch/dinner accommodations (never was there an advance reservation made) and then another tour guide had to help us get accommodation in Franschoek as we requested (Hank said there wasn't availability). Otherwise, the trip was fine - we saw the highlights and enjoyed our accommodations.But, sadly, it is in trying times that the true nature of people comes out. When we checked out of the hotel in Knysna, the front desk had our bags - Hank got our bags and put them in the car while we were finishing breakfast. It wasn't until we got back to Cape Town (5 hour drive) that we realized we were missing one of the bags (he only got 1 of the 2 rooms). As we worked to \"troubleshoot\" how the bag would make it in time for my flight the next morning, his true colors began to show - he refused to get my bag until I paid him an additional $350 (which was nearly half the total cost of my portion of the trip). While I still believed this was HIS mistake, I offered to meet him half way and cover half the expense - he refused, knowing he had me \"over a barrel.\" Very sad, I was late to my final dinner in CPT (that we had to arrange ourselves) because I was, instead, at my B&B setting up a paypal account to ensure he got paid so that I had my luggage. I'm grateful the bag made it and he was able to have it transported to me but this was not a great end to an otherwise wonderful holiday. I'm sure Hank will respond here and claim he has no responsibility for bags and that $350 is a totally reasonable amount to cover gas and payment to his cousin (I did a gas calculator on this and, at most expensive, it cost R659 roundtrip - that's <$60). SO disappointing, he seemed like such a nice guy (my B&B operators were totally floored at how he handled things). No matter the responsibility, I was floored at how quickly it was about blame rather than finding a solution or ensuring his customer had a good holiday/experience. That should have been at the front of his mind, and the first thing - not how he would make a buck on my bad luck."

Hank is very passionate and knowledgeable with a bit of banter also :-) We had to stop on the way as someone's pigs had escaped on the road so hank ran to tell the owner and saved the pigs! We also beeped at an ape to save that too! This was all before we reached the safari at inverhorn (can't remember the name). It's much better than the other safaris offered to tourists.Hank ensured we got the best seats on the safari right at the front :-) with the best game driver also (Stanley). The safari was brilliant, we saw every animal possible and got really close too. After this we got a lovely lunch and had a dip in the pool before driving back to camps bay. Overall a brilliant trip, well worth the money and we would definitely recommend Ulungele tours! Thanks Hank!"

Upon our arrival, Hank was already waiting for us in a very easy to spot area in the arrivals hall. During our drive to the hotel, Hank filled us in on all the details of Capetown & the surrounding area. We arrived on a Saturday evening & had no problem getting to our hotel in the heart of Capetown within 25 minutes. We booked the Best of the Cape Day Tour for our 2nd full day in Capetown. It was a perfect day for a tour of the Cape! It was a full day of sightseeing from the drive along Camps Bay to Chapmans Peak Drive down to the Cape Point Nature Reserve over to the Penguins at Bolders Beach all before lunch! The afternoon was perfect in the Stellenbosch region enjoying wine tastings as 3 different vineyards. When the original place we stopped for lunch wasn't open, Hank easily came up with a even better plan for lunch in the town of Stellenbosch. All along the way Hank provided us with his personal knowledge of the rich history in the Capetown region. We wanted to see everything in our short time in Capetown so we definitely picked the right tour one! We returned to our Hotel in time for us to enjoy our last evening in Capetown. Hank returned the next morning to provide us with our return trip to the airport. Hank was right on time & we got to the airport in plenty of time for our flight.We learned so much more of the culture & people that make up the area than doing the drive on our own. We have traveled the world to many different places, taking the large bus tours to the self drive tours but have never done a private tour with our own guide. We couldn't have been happier than choosing Hank as our guide to explore the area. It will make going back to any non-private tour a hard choice again! Hank takes pride in his tour company & it really shows in the way he provides his services. We would recommend to anyone visiting the Capetown area to book an airport transfer, day tour, or even multiple day tours with Ulungele Tours - Hank will make it a trip of a lifetime!"

What's great about Hank is that is he constantly adapting his proposals and suggestions based on the our needs. He also made sure we made the best possible use of the limited time that we had in Cape Town make sure we got a glimpse of almost everything important.

He would fill us in on not just information about places but also about the history of South Africa, the people, the politics and possibly everything else under the sun.

He stopped the car for us to get out and take pictures and always offered to take pictures of my husband and I. He was worth every single penny. Thank you Hank!"

Hank met me when I arrived and we quickly set off for my guest house. During the trip, he gave me a quick overview of the history of Cape Town and the area. He got me to my destination with no problems. The pickup and return to the airport was equally easy and interesting. While I did not use him for day tours, I would imagine they are quite good as he is very knowledgeable and interesting. I recommend Ulungele Tours to anyone visiting Cape Town."

Hank knows his business, is an excellent driver, and can answer most any question you might have. Our tour was somewhat standard (Cape of Good Hope with two stops along the way and one stop on our return to Cape Town). But we didn't ask Hank for anything unusual. I have a feeling he would be happy to take you or stop anywhere you like. I am sure he'd find something for you if you didn't have a place in mind. My only criticism is that it is expensive and seems fairly standard (like he's done it a million times). But to be fair -- that's what you want -- someone who has done it a lot. To get more out of it I guess I'd suggest asking for some stops of particular interest to you or your group. Otherwise, I'm with everyone who says, \"Call Hank.\""

I first got in touch with Hank in November 2013 and from day one Hank went out of his way to help me. Hank picked us up at our hotel and from the first minute made us feel as if we knew him for years. Hank was very informative, kind, polite and went out of his way to tell us the history of the areas we visited on his tour. His car was spotless and his driving was excellent.Hank does this tour different to other tour companies and it works very well because we missed the crowds and the queuing in each spot we visited. Hank was very flexible and worked this tour around our interests. We visited all the major sites that we wanted to see on our way like Cape of Good Hope, Simons Town, Cape point and the Penguins. Hank stopped at spots for photographs along the route and we got some of the best photographs of our trip to South Africa here. He gave us good advice in relation to visiting Table Top Mountain. Hank told us that we should visit Table Top Mountain when it was clearer and suggested we go later that day. So we took his advice and visited it on our way back to Cape Town. Hank firstly rang the information office to check the times of the last cable cart. He then dropped us off at the ticket office on our way back to Cape Town. We went up on a clear day and got the best views. This advice was excellent as the next few days in Cape Town the mountain was covered with clouds. He also gave me good driving tips and places to see along our route, for the rest of our holiday on the Garden Route. Our only regret is we didn\u2019t use Hank for our other trips in Cape Town.We hope to return to Cape Town and South Africa in the future and one thing for sure is we will be using Hank and Ulungele Tours to organise our trip."

Hank, who is the owner, was with us through our trip in Cape Town and drove us around the city. I was introduced to Ulungele and Hank through my agent (Safaris4Me) who helped with my bookings in Kruger. We had some bad luck with the weather in Cape Town, but we had Hank as our bright spot. He did everything to switch around our schedules in order to help us maximize our time in Cape Town. He did this with very little follow up from us and was constantly in touch with his contacts, pursuing the next opening for our activities. He is extremely knowledgeable about the history of the country and we had many nice long conversations during our drives. He was very flexible and accommodative of our stops during the day. Although we were driven around it almost felt like we had our own car and were doing our own thing! Certainly recommend Ulungele and Hank, for the high quality service that he provides! Our Cape Town experience wouldn\u2019t have been as much fun if not for Hank!"

He immediately put me at ease on arrival to his beautiful city, Hank was so easy to talk too he informed me of the history of Cape Town and pointed out numerous places of interest. By the time we had arrived at my hotel we had decided upon a plan for my final day in Cape Town. Hank arranged to take me on the best of the Cape tour and a couple of wine tasting sessions in Stellenbosch. The day was an absolute blast, one of the best days I have ever had whilst on holiday. We covered some mileage but it was well broken with stops at all the major sites of interest. If you book one of these trips ask to go to the best fish and chips restaurant in the cape (I guarantee you won't be disappointed). I don't think at any point during the day we didn't talk, Hank is such a genuinely friendly and professional person that he is so easy to talk with. I wish him all the best with his business and I am sure his knowledge and personality will see him have every success. Thank you for a great tour and I would not hesitate in booking you for my next adventure to Cape Town."

Just came back from an incredible visit to this beautiful part of Africa...had been talking to Hank via e-mail before the trip about the tour and expectations...well, he exceeded himself. He's not only very knowledgeable about his country and area, but also very pleasant, polite and formal person ready to go out of his way to please his customer. Hank picked us up in our CapeTown Central hotel, then we went from Capetown to Cape Alguhas, then to Hermanus to see the whales. On our way to Cape Alguhas we stopped at Pascal's in Napier, a French country style caf\u00e9 for a capuccino which was delish. This trip was amazing and just seeing the whales in the bay leaping out of the water was breathtaking. Going to Cape Alguhas, the real tip of Africa, was an adventure. You literally stand on a rock right between where the Atlantic and Indian Oceans meet. BTW, very, very rough waters as expected. It also had a very pretty lighthouse Afterwards we went to a very nice seafood restaurant for lunch in Hermanus where the food was very good. There was a \"whale\" festival in Hermanus at this time with music, dancing and food everywhere. It really was a beautiful trip since we were hugging the coastline during the whole trip back to Capetown. Hank was pointing out places and their stories to us and taking time to answer our many questions. He is also a safe driver, too.In a nutshell, our family recommend Hank 100% for a tour of CapeTown and its environs with the utmost certainty...he will make your trip worthwhile in every way and you will gain the knowledge that only comes first-hand from an expert in this area and country. Thanks for reading my review."

With this in mind, neither my husband nor I had previously gone on safari, and wanted to see the Big 5 since we were in SA. This was a great introduction, and completely met our expectations.We also knew that we were coming to Cape Town during the rainy season, so needed to have some flexibillty with our day tour dates. Hank was understanding and flexible - after having contacted him from the U.S. and making tentative dates in advance, we confirmed the safari a couple of days beforehand once we knew the weather forecast for the next couple of days. Our driver, Tony, was punctual in picking us up from our hotel, personable, and knowledgeable about the region. He was a great representative of the tour company.I whole-heartedly recommend Ulungele Tours, and hope to be able to use them again in the future on a repeat visit to Cape Town. Thanks, Hank!"

My Husband and I found this firm last year and we did put in a review. We have used a second time as we knew we could depend on Hank and were not disappointed. We had done several trips with Hank previously which was kept on record and on the initial booking for Airport transfers we asked for some ideas for day trips. Hank came up with several options (a different Wine route for one) and we visited Riebeek Valley, a beautiful historic town Tulbagh and Breede River Valley. The scenery was absolutely stunning! Never rushed, driving excellent and safe and his knowledge of his country and the places we visited 'second to non'. Thank you Hank, we will be back in SA late 2014 and are hoping to get back to Cape Town during our travels. We now look on hank as a 'friend' and he will be our first point of contact before we return."

The driver was friendly (despite the hour) and the drive to the airport was pleasant. After checking-in I realised I lost my wallet. Hoped and prayed it slipped out of my pocket in the cab. I was on my way to Brazil via Johannesburg and was fearing the worst including missing my flight in order to deal with the lost/stolen wallet when Hank appeared out of no-where, confirmed my identity and handed my wallet back to me. Never been so impressed and surprised in my life. I had resigned myself to the worst. The feeling of elation cannot be quantified.To Hank and the driver (whose name I cannot remember unfortunately, think it was Denzel), I would recommend you and your company to anyone travelling to Cape Town and that was the case even before my wallet was delivered to me personally by Hank!"

I used Ulungele only for return airport transfers as I know CT well and had a car hired for the majority of my trip however it was clear from our short trip that he would have been a great choice for any day trip as he was friendly, knowledgeable and had a spacious, air-conditioned mini-van. We extended our trip due to the snow in London and Hank was able to change our pick up date with no hassle. Overall I can highly recommend."

We found Ulungele Tours on line when looking for transfers from Airport to Hotel in Cape Town, we made enquiries from the UK with regards to cost and although we made several enquires to other firms Ulungele was the best quote and they were also more professional in their response. We were so impressed with the service we had on the transfer with Hank that we booked several trips with him whilst we were there and cannot fault the service we received! Hank was extremely knowledgable about his country and all aspects from tourism, politics, history and even the weather recommending which trips when etc. On all occasions he was 'on time', we were not rushed on the tours we did, which included stopping longer on the wine tour than anticipated! All trips were well organized, Hank was full of enthusiasm, friendly, and the main thing, an excellent driver who my husband, our friends and myself felt very 'safe' with. We shall be visiting Cape Town again this year and will not hesitate to use Ulungele Tours again."

We booked a day tour of the Peninsula and Winelands with Ulungele Tours and it was one of the best days we had during our trip! Hank met us at our hotel in the morning and drove us around all day in a very comfortable van. We found him to be very friendly, professional, and knowledgable about the Cape Town area! He provided us commentary on the wildlife, geography, history, languages, and then political and economic climate in South Africa. We were really impressed with his knowledge. And I can't believe how much we saw in one day: seals in Hout Bay, ostriches, baboons, Cape Point, Cape of Good Hope, the lighthouse, penguins on Boulders Beach, Stellenbosch, and wine tasting at Spier Estate! If you're limited on time in Cape Town, I definitely recommend this tour. Or he has plenty of other tours to choose from. They are priced affordably (I shopped around a bit before I booked) and he will answer your emails with any questions promptly. You really can't go wrong with this company. We highly recommend Ulungele!!!"

We were taken to many of the best spots along the peninsula, treated to a homemade South African style lunch, informed about the history and myths along the different stops, and listened to South African music while on the bus.The small groups make for a much more personal experience and you really feel comfortable. I would definitely recommend them as one of the best ways to see a lot in one day!"

They obviously love their city and will gomto great lenghts to share it with you. Our group of backpackers blended really well during a day trip thanks to personal attention from our guides and their talent to connect with people. Playing a great mix of South African pop rock music in the background, sharing their positive energy and giving us personal attention all the time. I could go on like this forever but I'll keep it short and no nonsense instead. To experience this you need to do it. Thumbs up to these honest young people, well done!!!"

Ziggy is super knowledgeable about the entire region -- history, nature, people -- and also very friendly. My group was pretty small, but I can imagine Ziggy would make it very easy for solo travelers to have a great time with everyone else on the tour. Other tours have you do a small amount of cycling at the Cape, but Ziggy -- very thoughtfully -- skips this to allow you to take one of the most beautiful hour-long walks I've ever experienced from the lighthouse to another gorgeous viewpoint -- absolutely spectacular! Of course, I enjoyed the stunning scenery, the delicious (and healthy) lunch, and the winery stop, but it was also a pleasure just to spend the afternoon with Ziggy and talk to her about South Africa and her travels around the world. Our day together was one of the highlights of my time in Cape Town and, really, all of South Africa."

Brilliant way to see the beauty of Cape Town. This is truly a magical city and Lucky & Lost Tours certainly add their bit of fairy dust to the whole experience. P.S. Learnt the word Lekker which is South African slang for great, delicious, amazing, awesome, fantastic, brilliant, awe inspiring, best ever... the list of goodness goes on. So in the words of a true South African this tour was LEKKER!"

I would give the edge to Simonsig because their excellent Shiraz offerings. Note that the selection of wineries may change with each tour on account of availability and scheduling. You really can't go wrong with the South African wineries, however, either on account of the wines offered or the bucolic settings.At Franschhoek, we had an excellent lunch at the French Connection restaurant. The menu was extensive and highly affordable, and we were allowed to uncork our two bottles of \"Mackenzie\" wines just purchased at Hartenberg. Several of us ordered the sliced kudu (large antelope) steak, which was juicy and delicious, a perfect match for our wines!Cape Town is a wonderful city to visit, but it's not easy to visit either the Cape of Good Hope or the Cape wineries if you don't have a car. Tim is a knowledgeable and charismatic guide who showed us all of these places and greatly enhanced our visit. And he was very patient with our sometimes chaotic seven-person group. Finally, while this probably goes without saying given the company's name, Tim was the perfect match for our group with 5 of 7 members being openly gay men. We learned a lot! :-)"

One was a wine tasting day in Stellenboch and the other was a Peninsula tour. Both were absolutely fantastic! Tim was able to accommodate everything we were looking for... My two friends were interested in doing some port tasting, so he managed to squeeze a place in for them - even on a Sunday! The wineries he chose were all wonderful.On our second tour, we went to the peninsula and saw penguins at the reserve and seals along the way. We also stopped in multiple bays along the way and ate at a fantastic restaurant for lunch. We made it to the Cape of Good Hope and Tim let us stop at several scenic areas to take photos and point out wildlife. He was extremely knowledgable about the history of South Africa and we learned a great deal from our time with him.I would highly recommend Friends of Dorothy tours to anyone who is in Cape Town. They are absolutely worth the price!!!"

Originally we asked to do a peninsula tour but we did say - if the weather is going to bad - please just think of something else for us to do.When we met him - he informed us that the weather was miserable and that he recommended that we do the wine tour. Being wine drinkers - we were 100% fine with that suggestion.On our way to do the wine tasting - we learned about the history of Cape Town and little other tid bits of information. The information that he shared, along with his personal stories helped paint a picture of what life is in South Africa and Cape Town.Being someone that loves to learn about the culture and identity of an area - this was perfect.The wineries that he picked were great - along with the lunch location. Now this might not seem like a big deal - but I called him on a Sunday (on Sundays 85% of wineries are closed) at 9:30 am for a 10:30 am start. So yes - he pulled off a Superman like moved and rescued the day."

The first was the winelands of Stellenbosch and surroundings (\"Yellow Brick Road\") and the second was Cape Peninsula with False bay, penguins, Cape of Good Hope, Cape Point Nature reserve (\"The Ruby Slipper\").On the Winelands tour we stopped at some really beautiful wineries, but also got to see Stellenbosch, Franschoek and the beautiful surroundings. Our guide Tim helped us pick out wineries, but was also very flexible to the changing wishes of the group. While driving Tim told us a lot of fascinating stories about Cape Town, wine making, different grapes etc. All in all it was a marvellous day, filled with wine, good food and beautiful sights.The next day we went on the Peninsula tour. We went through Simon\u00b4s town (where we were introduced to Just Nuisance), via the penguin colony to Cape of Good Hope. Here we had a walk through the Cape point nature reserve and then went for a great seafood lunch at restaurant Two Oceans. We saw a lot of different animals, but were also amazed by the flowers. Unlikely at it seems the group agreed that this day was perhaps even better than the first one! The sights along the coastline are absolutely unforgettable. Whoever books a trip with Tim is in for a real treat. He is incredibly knowledgeable, and has a deep understanding of so many subjects (Cape Town history and politics, wine and winemaking, architecture, birds, plants...) paired with a gift of delivering anecdotes. I learned (and laughed) so much during the two days! Tim is also the perfect host, engaging everyone in the party and making sure all are having a good time.In short: when in Cape Town, day touring with Tim Freeman of Friends of Dorothy is something not to be missed!"

We had scheduled a tour to go to Hermanus for a day to look for Right Whales and also to tour the area. We had a lovely tour through Cape Town, then through the Elgin Orchard area. We stopped just short of Hermanus at the top of a peak to look down at the amazing coast and view from above, but also to try to spot where the whales may be. We then made our way to Hermanus. Such a beautiful quaint little town and the coast line was spectacular! Crashing wave over a rocky coast. There was a cliff trail that you could walk along or sit and watch. We spotted several whales, from a distance, but still was so cool to see!Then we went to lunch on the waterfront with Tim and had great food, sat outside, and even saw several whales breach during lunch!We then drove to Betty's Bay where they have the African penguin colony. This place was great! Less touristy than Simon's Town, Boulder's Beach (so we hear), and we were able to get closer to the penguins, there were 100's!Our drive back was the coastal route/scenic route along Chapman's Peak Drive. The sun was setting and the view was phenomenal! We even saw baboons walking along the wall on the side of the road! Tim is an amazing tour guide! He is fun, easy to get a long with, and very knowledgable about the area and the history of Cape Town, and enjoys telling you about it!I highly recommend booking a private tour with Tim. Thanks Tim!"

We spent a few minutes at the Botanic Garden before heading to the Boulders to see the Penguin Colony, followed by the dramatic ride to the Cape of Good Hope. We all climbed to the top of the Cape peak and followed that with a delicious lunch at the Two Oceans Restaurant. We then drove up the Atlantic coast and had a quick wine tasting at a nearby vineyard. We headed back to Cape Town and saw the 12 Apostles rock formation.We passed through Clifton & Camps Bay before we headed back into the city. Tim is a fun, interesting guy who shares his cultural, historical and geographic knowledge of South Africa & Cape Town throughout the tour. I highly recommend using Tim on your next visit to Cape Town. You will not be disappointed!"

This review is a bit overdue, but after a few weeks I am still thinking about my two days on the wine trails, how much I learned about he area, and how much fun we had. The first day, Tim collected me and two friends from the Hotel in Cape Town. Driving out to the wine country, he pointed out important landmarks, interesting historical attractions, and fun facts about the area you're sure not likely to get on other tours. We started day one in Franschoek as Tim fulfilled our request to focus on some of South Africa's best sparkling wines. We toured three wineries, had a fantastic lunch at Delaire Graff, and purchased more wine than we knew what to do with. For anyone looking for a gay friendly tour operator, Friend's of Dorothy is it (as one might assume). Day two of the wine excursions included myself and 4 gay friends from London that I'd recently met at a wedding. While always professional, Tim made this day even more fun. The humor and jokes flowed as freely as the wine and rain that day. We toured several spectacular estates, purchased even more wine, had a Delicious lunch and one of South Africa's best, Overture. I was looking for a gay friendly wine tour, and was connected to Tim through Out in Africa tours. I'm so glad to have made the connection."

We had one day in Cape Town stopover while on QM2, I had organised with Tim to take us to Table Mountain, Stellenbosch Botanical Gardens and a winery. Our cruise ship was late arriving due to high winds but Tim was waiting for us in his nice, clean people mover. He had advised us to buy tickets for the cable car for table mountains online before we arrived. This saved us a lot of time as the queues to buy tickets let alone getting on the cable car was very long. We got there long before 4 bus loads from our ship had arrived and had 45 minute wait to get to the top. Tim pointed out quite a lot of interesting information. We then went to botanical gardens where we tried different South African foods in the cafe and then Tim took us for a walking tour of the gardens and once again was very knowledgeable and pointed out many interesting plants. He also managed to take us to a very nice winery called Klein Constantia for wine tasting. We had a great time and saw so much in a day.We definitely recommend booking Tim."

We are in our 70s and are still fairly agile, but without Tim's guidance and help we would not have accomplished half of what we did with him. After hearing the things we wanted to do and see, he managed everything. He did the driving, arranged reservations, chose places for lunch, etc. He made excellent additional suggestions.We toured Cape Town itself both walking and driving where we saw District 6, the Castle, the Company's Gardens, Signal Hill and more. Since our four days with Tim were on alternate days spread out over a week, Tim showed us many places we could return to on our own (including Table Mountain, the Slave Lodge, the Anglican Cathedral, and others). Outside the city, we went to the superb Hartenberg winery estate, the beautiful Kirstenboch Gardens, and the fruit and vegetable gardens in Babylonstoren. Along the way we stopped at places to sample artisan chocolates, craft beer, and olives. We went to Simon's Town and Betty's Bay to see the penguins and stood on the Cape of Good Hope. The drives to and from these places were beautiful. The mountains and beaches are fantastic sights.Tim also arranged for a tour of Langa Township with a guide from the community itself. It was a sobering and enlightening experience. I helped us contextualize our trip in the context of South African history, culture, and current affairs. We were a bit apprehensive but there was no need to have been. The people of Langa Township welcomed us. We recommend this visit stronglyNever did we feel rushed. Although we went many places in a few days, we had ample time at each of our destinations. With Tim doing the driving, it eliminated all of the extra time required to schedule a tour on one's own and to figure out how to get to places!It was more than worth the money. We visited Amsterdam on our own before flying to Cape Town. We did quite well there but Cape Town with a tour guide--especially Tim--was much more successful.Tim possesses a broad and deep knowledge of Cape Town and South Africa which he eagerly shares with his clients. He is very articulate and speaks clearly. We had no problem hearing him in the back seat of his comfortable SUV. He also thrives on his clients' suggestions, questions, and opinions. At times he had to remind us that we should be looking out the window!Tim is an affable, cheerful traveling companion. We felt that we had made a friend. Our advice is to seize the opportunity to engage Tim as a tour guide. You won't regret it for a minute. Our visit to Cape Town and environs was the trip of a life time and Tim Freeman was instrumental in making it so!"

We did the Cape Peninsula tour and went to the Winelands, and even asked Tim to take us to Kirstenbosch on our last day there because we enjoyed having him as our guide so much. Tim was happy to cater to our needs--from getting my dad a stool to make it easier for him to get into the van to taking us to a wine farm that was recommended to us for its sheer beauty. One of the highlights of being with Tim was the first day when he picked us up--he had seen whales not far from our hotel, and he was so excited to show them to us!

In Cape Town, one major educational goal was to learn about the different populations of South Africa. Tim delivered in spades. We started our day with an overview of the European history, focused on Central Cape Town. Highlights for us were the Company Gardens, the flower market, District Six, and Groote Kirk. We then headed up to Signal Hill for the noon gun. It was an exciting ride up the hillside and we got there just in time.Next was the Cape Malay district where we admired the cheerfully painted homes, saw the prettiest mosque in Cape Town, and visited a spice shop. We had a curried-chicken lunch in a cook's home, and learned to make samosas. The food was delicious, and the conversation very informative. This was the first time my husband had been in a Muslim home, so he was very interested in the art work and the family's day-to-day life. Finally, we ended our day at Langa Township. This was simply amazing. We learned so much about the township system, how/when/why people moved to Cape Town after the fall of apartheid, and the community itself. We were happy to see people's pride in their community and the projects in place to help people learn a trade or craft. To be honest, it was a little uncomfortable to be visiting a community in such an intimate way, peering in to their homes and picking our way through the narrow paths. Visiting Langa, however, was vital to our understanding of South Africa, Cape Town, and Apartheid. (After all, traveling is all about experiencing new and different things, and if you're really trying to do that, you're going to be a little uncomfortable once in a while.) Note, however, that we were warmly welcomed by the Langa guide, the Langa children, and the people we met along the way.Tim's knowledge about the city was vast. He was able to answer all of our questions in great detail. His fellow \"teachers\", our cook in the Cape Malay district, and our local Langa guide, were friendly and welcomed our questions. They all had clear pride in their cultures, businesses, and communities. One downside of the tour for us was that the morning and lunch portion of the tour was very quickly-paced. We felt as if we were rushing through several elements. If I were to do this again, I'd want to take it more leisurely and break it in to two days."

Tim was a joy to work with..he entertained our requests to change a tour without any hesitation and recommended things that made the tours something very special..some examples were Streetwires,.a cottage industry shop in the colorful Bokap neighborhood..proceeds from this wire animal shop go to AIDS and breast cancer research..Our visit to the Langa township was a fascinating, life-changing experience..and his choice of the Two Oceans Restaurant on the fullday Cape tour approached a true gourmet experience..I have been a travel agent in the United States for over 40 years and have dealt with various tour operators but Tim is one of the best!..Thanks again..Roger (and his husband, Robert)"

When we hire a private guide, it is important to us that the person is not only knowledgeable but that they are fun and personable in addition. We were in touch with a number of private guide companies in Cape Town and ultimately chose Tim from Friends of Dorothy for two full days of touring. Tim really paid attention to what we wanted and helped us plan two customized days of touring rather than the preplanned itineraries that other companies offered. We did a day down the Cape peninsula and a day in the Winelands. Each day included fabulous food and some stops that were more popular among locals than tourists.Tim had an unfortunate accident shortly before our trip. He went above and beyond to make sure that he put us in touch with his replacement, Anine, and that we were satisfied with the substitution. Anine turned out to be charming, full of information, and a delight to be with. She even helped us choose restaurants for our dinners and made sure we had reservations. We were delighted with our two days of touring and highly recommend Friends of Dorothy."

However, when I found out we can customize the tour to what we would like to do with only the people in your traveling group I was willing to give it a try especially traveling with 3 other women.We did the wine tour one day and drove the cost to see the penguins the next day. Our guide was Cheryl (Tim was having surgery) and she was fabulous. She set up some magnificent visits to wineries for some terrific tastings a few of them pored by the owner. The ride along the coast was breathtaking. Cheryl was very knowledgeable and passionate about all of Cape Town. She was also very accommodating to many of our requests (finding boxes to pack wine, dropping us off at the harbor, to shop etc). Everything was very well organized. I would love to do it again."

She and her dishes were lovely!We also visited a township and went into couple of homes for a first hand experience. Also a Peninsular tour including Cape of Good Hope and on 3rd day, Stellenbosch winelands where we indulged in cheeses and cold cuts with some wine. Wonderful for port, olive oil and balsamic vinegar too! Tim was good company and kept his MPV stocked with delicious juices. One of the smoothies was so good we looked in supermarts but eluded us. Mates felt a pity we didn't manage visit Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens as planned and wished Tim prompted us on that, on hindsight."

Tim coordinated everything, and even decreased the cost of the tour when one couple dropped out and we were able to use a smaller vehicle. We had an incredible experience at the Langa township. Tim then questioned us closely about our wishes regarding the wine tour, and guided us through two wineries which matched our taste in wines. In between we had a delicious lunch in an idyllic setting. We found Tim to be personable, informative, and very willing to create a tour to meet our wishes."

Prior to our arrival to Cape Town, we had e-mail contact and planned what we wanted to see end experience. Tim came up with some ideas and they were great all the way. He picked us up at the hotel at 9.00 in the morning, and our trip started with a short stop at Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens. He has great knowledge and gave us an introduction to the beautiful and special flora this area is known for. Then we went to the False Bay Coast at Muizenberg and the surfer 's corner. We drove on to Kalk Bay harbor to see the Cape Fur Seals, and at the local fish market we also got a little introduction to the \u201ccatch of the day\u201d! After Simon\u2019s Town and Boulders Beach with the penguins, we headed into the National Park. We walked from Cape Point to Cape of Good Hope, a 40 minutes beautiful walk. Tim met us down there with the car, and from there we drove back along the Atlantic Ocean to Noordhoek, where we had lunch at The Food Barn. We had a nice break with great food and a fun and interesting conversation with Tim. After lunch the drive went on back to Cape Town through Chapman's Peak and Hout bay, a beautiful drive! Back in town, we ended up at Signal Hill where Tim had organized some bubbles for us. Beautiful views with a glass of bubbles in hand! A great way to end a great day with a great guide! I can recommend Tim Freeman and will absolutely contact him again if we go back to Cape Town in the future."

Tim was very helpful in asking us what our personal interests were (serious wine tasting, sight-seeing, architecture, etc.). He made some suggestions for wineries he thought we might enjoy and politely suggested that some of the wineries we thought of visiting were either very remote or might be limited in their wine selections. Tim picked us up from our hotel in his roomy and comfortable van, showed us the cooler he had packed with water and refreshments to enjoy during our tour, and confirmed our time schedule. We were very impressed with how knowledgeable and witty Tim is. He not only made personal introductions to the staff at each of the five wineries (and our lunch-time restaurant as well), he made sure that all tasting and entrance fees were taken care of so that we didn't need to worry about extra expenses. He pointed out interesting plants, birds and animals along our journey, picking up on the fact that we had just come from a safari in Botswana and Zambia. Tim is very personable, professional and well-prepared. We were thrilled that we were able to visit five wineries on a gentle and comfortable pace without having to worry about directions or details.

On a one day Cape Peninsular tour, I saw whales frolicking close inshore, had a very close encounter with a fur seal, enjoyed the penguins, walked from the Cape of Good Hope to Cape Point and was treated to amazing sea and land views. Added to the excellent lunch overlooking the sea near Cape Point it was exactly what I had wanted from the tour. When you can see big coaches disgorging 70 or 80 people who just want a photo at the Cape signpost, it's clear how worthwhile a good guide is. Tim threw in a Cape Town tour on the way out of town, stopped frequently and flexibly and has a great deal of humorously delivered knowledge to share."

He showed us all the must see sights and steered us through a beautiful tour around the peninsula and wine tours. If you are interested in seeing wineries, hire Tim. He is more knowledgable than the winery employees so he can add a lot of additional info and great suggestions. He was very courteous and has a great personality for keeping people entertained.

He took us to the wine country and to the Cape of Good Hope. We had an amazing experience with fantastic food, great conversation, and spectacular views of the coast. Tim was the epitome of a what we wanted in a tour guide - he brought us to places that were unique and interesting while having the education and knowledge to explain the history and background of the areas we visited. He also provided suggestions of places to visit in our free time based on our interests - he helped us buy tickets for a rugby game, suggested trails for hiking up Table Mountain, and found an amazing store/museum for us to look at Tanzanite jewelry. I would highly recommend hiring Tim as a tour guide."

Tim has a natural friendly style and is very well informed about the area. His clean and comfortable vehicle (VW T5 minibus) had supplies such as water and snacks - plus some umbrellas (which were needed for this Cape Town winter weather). We were picked up from our hotel as planned at 9am and we followed his route around the cape which took advantage of the (little) sun and meant we avoided most buses/coaches. There were four of us and we feel this tour was good value for money. It is worth investing more in a personal tour and having a guide meant we learnt a lot more about the area and its history. We had a really good day and we are sure you will too! Many thanks to Tim."

I contacted Tim prior to arriving and described what we were interested in doing - a tour of the wine country, preferably including some wineries that were a little more off the beaten path. Tim picked us up at our hotel around 9:00 am and we headed towards the Stellenbosch area. We toured three wineries over the course of the day including a lovely one with a Japanese style tea garden. Tim was knowledgeable and entertaining; frequently quoting poetry to illustrate a point. Over the course of the day, we chatted about wine, history, the areas we were visiting and a wide range of subjects. He made changes to our itinerary as we went based on comments we made. For example, after I talked about how much I loved to cook, he added in a stop at an olive farm where we sampled different olive oils made on site. Tim sent me a list of restaurant recommendations and I had selected three that I thought we would enjoy. We had a wonderful lunch at La Petite Ferme which was one of the three on my list. All in all the day fit perfectly with what I had envisioned and I would highly recommend Tim for anyone interested in doing a tour."

We chose the Cape Town city tour but were left feeling that if we had more time that we should have signed up for more tours, since the level of knowledge that was provided was so strong. There is no way we could have gotten as much out of Cape Town if we did not take this tour. We got to see so much more of the city, learned so much about the history, as well as the food and culture. He was very organized, communicated well prior to the tour to make sure we were well taken care of relative to what we wanted to see, and also answered all of our questions (and we had a lot of them). I'm sure the other tours are great too, but I would definitely recommend that you put on your walking shoes and pick the friends of Dorothy city tour to lean about Cape Town!"

Three of us decided to take a day tour of the Winelands and having been so impressed with Tim from 'Friends of Dorothy Tours' on a previous visit to Cape Town we booked again. It was a fantastic day! Tim really goes the extra mile to personalise the experience so that you feel this is not just another tourist day tour. Our friend was convinced she loved only red wine and Tim took us to try some great reds. He also took time to chat with our friend for some time and then took us to a fantastic vineyard to challenge some of our ideas - and he was right she (and we) loved the white wine we were trying. Tim also took time ahead of the trip to find out our lunch preferences and so we had a magical (and incredibly good value) wine tasting lunch on a vine covered terrace in beautiful surroundings. Later Tim could see we were looking for something different and suggested chocolate tasting - another great idea.More than anything the tour is memorable for the informed and entertaining style Tim maintains for the whole day and for the comfort of the spacious tour van. We paid a little extra for the private tour (just three of us) which gives you great flexibility. Our previous tours (in a bigger mixed group) were also excellent and I never saw Tim phased at all by any of the questions or demands aimed at him. The Cape Tour was particularly entertaining and informative.If you are looking for a fun and entertaining day with the reassurance of knowing you are safe in the hands of an expert then we heartily recommend 'Friends of Dorothy Tours'."

Our tour guides (Isaac and Maudi) were really great, especially Maudi always made us laugh and told us lots of interesting stories about the country - even though we were probably not the \"easiest\" group, being just girls and 13 (!) of them. The landscape was great and there were lots of really great activities (zip-lining, hiking in Tsitsikamma NP, canoeing, whale watching and my personal highlights, the sunrise game drive in Addo NP and surfing in Jeffreys Bay!). Even if it was somtimes a bit rushed, our guides managed to make basically every activity possible. Most of the backpackers we stayed in were amazing, too! The only downside of the tour for me was the group of travellers - they were nice, but on my tour we were only girls, most of them German and except for one all of them really young (I know it's always a bit of luck and due to advertising and stuff there are always many young travellers that come from different volunteering projects, but as I did another tour right after this one, I just really felt the difference). Nonetheless I would definitely recommend the tour and Hotspots2C if you don't mind this."

Also impressive, Mordy had an eye for detail: He was very organised so we never had to rush, he commanded us when we were entering the caves to not wear jumpers as it is boiling underground (very good choice) and he even went to the effort of making sure the windows were spotless so we could have a great view of the landscape driving. I feel incredibly humble to have these memories and thank my tour guide for an entertaining trip and especially for encouraging us all to get involved in the activities: most memorable, convincing us to bungy jump and trying a home-cooked meal at the backpackers called potjie!!!- SO GOOD."

Aside from the convenience of being picked right at the doorstep of my hotel, the tour guide was awesome! He was very pleasant, very courteous, and very sensitive to the clients' needs. I would have loved to book more trips had I not been scheduled to fly out the next day. I hope you get ANDREW as your tour guide when you book here! Fantastic Cape Town experience, I must say! Thank you very much, Andrew and Hotspots2c Travel and Tours!Professor Shirley N. DitaManila, the Philippines"

Turns out eventhough if only one person took the tour they will still go, it became somewhat a private tour which was perfect for us. Our guide Gerhard was very helpful and knowlegeable of the vast history of South Africa. The route that we took was beautiful and the places we stayed for the night was perfect. We took the 4 days garden route + caves adventures.. at the end we didn't just have a great time but we got a friend as well.. thx Gerhard and Hotspots2c"

It was a fabulous five day tour of the garden route, a tour that had no bad features whatsoever. Suzanne and I loved the range of activities we did every day, from exploring Addo National Park, to ziplining through waterfalls, to cave crawling, to hiking alongside fantastic viewpoints, this tour was one of the best holidays I have ever been on. Our tour guide, Isaac, was incredible. Incredibly knowledgeable, incredibly caring and thoughtful for everyone on the tour, and helped make the trip the unbelievable experience it was. If you ever want to see the Garden Route, Cape Town and do a wide range of activities in South Africa, I would throughly recommend this tour. You will have the opportunity to try new foods, go wine tasting, play with varying South African Animals from cheetahs to elephants to ostriches, and overall have a fascinating and engaging exploration of life in South Africa. If you want to tour South Africa, whether you are a couple or a group of friends or of any age, this is the tour for you to do."

            "review": "If you are contemplating this tour- DO IT!!! Garden Route & Winelands (7 days). First, let me just say this is the best trip I've ever done, and I have traveled quite a bit. Isaac is the most charismatic, wonderful tour guide, and we had the pleasure of also traveling with Maudi, who was driving a separate group. They are so knowledgeable, organized, thorough, and fun. These two are so genuine and made everything amazing. In addition, my husband and I decided to backpack for our honeymoon, and we both agree it was the best thing we could have done. Isaac made sure that he pampered us where he could, which was so unnecessary, but so so appreciated. He was professional but also genuinely cared about each of us. The vans were new and always clean, with a/c and heat. Our tour had about 14 people in it, but they split it up into two vans so that there was plenty of room and personalization. I didn't feel like I was on a tour group, but instead with a group of travelers from around the world and different age groups, who soon became fast friends. I haven't done a formal multi day tour before, so I wasn't sure about it when booking, but I can't say enough about the quality of the vendors and events. My past experience with day tours was often to places where the tours had a relationship with the vendor, no matter how cheap the quality, and I felt forced to buy/ take part in what they were selling. This was NOTHING like that. Isaac and Maudi clearly have good relationships with each accommodation and experience because the vendors are professional and these two guides are fantastic people. Isaac still always had our opinions and best interests in mind, and even went into a restaurant he loved and frequently visits, and calmly explained to a waiter when he thought the waiter had screwed up and over charged us at one point. Our only regret is that we didn't see there was an 8 day tour that also did Cape of Good Hope, but Isaac helped hook us up with an additional tour to get there, even though it was a competitor's, because they could fit into our schedule and budget before we flew out. He went above and beyond for us, all the time.Every day we were in awe- it just kept getting better.We also chose to stay in a private room in the hostels, and I honestly think that while the 4 stars looked nice when we dropped off others on our tours, we had the best location for every place, often right on the beach (with the exception of Stellenbosch, I'd maybe try to upgrade on that location if they would let you for location's sake)... If you are ever going to contemplate shark diving, bungee jumping, walking with elephants, climbing through crevices in a cave... I can go on... I hadn't before, but this trip (kindly) pushed me to my limits, and we couldn't be happier we did it all. We were heartbroken when it ended. It is so hard to pick out a favorite part, and looking back, I can't believe how much we accomplished in 7 days! It went by so quickly because we were always doing something. I will be highly recommending this tour, and especially with Isaac and Maudi, to everyone I know interested in South Africa. I can't remember the last time I laughed and smiled so much! We talked it over, and there isn't anything we would change. We started out with amazing tour guides and ended with friends. Thank you! - 1 and a Half Hours from ChicagoPS: If you end up touring with Isaac, make sure you have a lot of Madonna on your Itunes. He loves Madonna. :)"

My guides were Isaac and Maudi, and they are some of the most amazing people I have ever met. They really do care about everyone who they guide the tours for - extra special care and attention to detail is why I enjoyed the whole tour so much. I wish I had spent more time with Maudi, because you could see how much he loved making people happy and it really stuck out for me when he got champagne and cake and gave another person on my tour the most southern birthday party in Africa! I spent more time with Isaac which I am very grateful for. Isaac does it all without asking for thanks or credit which is why I almost didn't notice how much extra care he was putting in. But I'm glad I did notice because I realised how inspirational he is and he has given me a boost of confidence which I can't thank him enough for. He made me feel the most comfortable and myself that I have ever felt. Shame he couldn't beat me at pool though! But I'll be back soon, so maybe he can give it another go then. Hotspots2C are a great company and I would definitely do another tour with them if I am back in South Africa. What sets Hotspots apart from other tour companies is they really are giving the best possible service they can, whilst juggling time schedules around and organising everything for you so you can sit back and relax knowing everything is sorted for you. Sit back or jump off the worlds tallest bungee bridge - I'll take the second every day! They do all their hard work with warm and friendly smiles on there faces - I miss you guys! Keep up the good work! Peace out. Jimmy"

Joined this tour at the last minute based on solid reviews here, a very transparent website with clear pricing, and quick follow up on the part of Belinda who handles bookings. I was traveling solo, female, early 40's. The tour included a mix of younger and older travelers with most of the older opting the 3* guesthouses. Good choice for me since the hostels were definitely more of a party scene. Our guide Ulrich was an absolute pleasure to travel with, very easygoing, happy to answer lots of questions, a great driver, and really well liked by every place we stopped. They greeted him like a dear friend at every stop, including the elephants! The 4-day, 3-night option was perfect for my schedule but 5 days would have made more sense considering the amount of driving. Choose that if you have the time, but the shorter one was also really great. Nothing but good things to say about HotSpots2c. I'm really happy that I took the leap in booking with them!"

Having just done both the 'wine & whale' (2 day) & Cape Point (1 day) trips I have been very pleased with the efficient organisation, communication, punctuality & format of both tours. The particular highlight for me was the shark dive near Hermanus (@ extra cost, but a unforgettable experience). The guide, Andrew, made both trips enjoyable with his commentary & friendly and considerate manner."

I had a wonderful experience I took two trips for 8 days total and both of my tour guys Andrew (rugby player) and I can't spell the others name but he was really funny and was always telling jokes. Both made the experience worth every penny and were so helpful and willing to go the extra mile for anything anyone needed. I highly suggest the Garden Route tour and definitely do the shark dive!"

In the 3 day trip, i we covered cango caves, elephant walk, canoing, bungee jump, myoli beach, big 5 game drive. Among these cango caves and bungee were good. The other stuffs i enjoyed on the trip are scenic routes and towns. Some good restaurants as well.Being from India, where i can easily walk with elephants, i didn't like elephant walk. I missed enjoying in the beach. Having done safari in Kruger National Park, didn't like the big 5 game drive. From big 5, was able to see only lion, elephant calf from distance and rhino. Lion is confined to small area. But the guide, Marco, for that game drive was very good. He added lot of character into all the animals we saw and lot other interesting information on animals.1 day Cape peninsula tour was good. Covered many places in one day. Duiker island cruise, Ostich Farm, Cape Point, Cape of Good Hope, chapman's peak, Boulder's beach.Guides cum Driver were nice and good. No complaints."

            "review": "Excellent Experience. I did two tours with Hotspots2C, one three day WoW and one five day Garden Tour with two different guides (Isaac and Kevin). This is my first time in S. Africa and I am traveling by myself. It is a great way to see the country for the first time and covers a lot \"cannot miss\" or \"must see\" spots. From the get go the staff was very prompt and helpful in answering my questions and supporting me making payments. Both tour guides are very friendly and fun to be around with. My impression is that they are quite knowledgeable. Isaac was my tour guide for the three day tour and he also led the 5 day tour in parallel with mine. Issac helped to break the ice with such a wonderful sense of humor. On the 5 day tour I sat next to Kevin in the front and asked millions questions and he was always happy to answer my questions and have a conversation just about anything. For those who enjoy more outdoor activities Kevin is THE guide to have. The relationships that they try to establish with the travelers felt genuine and personal (vs just business). I personally felt like that I left the tours with two friends in Cape Town and would hope to see them again at some point. I am also happy with the accommodation options they provided to me. Normally I would have liked to do my own research and pick the place but given this is a tour structure and I was not able to. The owners at the B&B places (I picked 3 star option) are very friendly and accommodating. Their hospitality made my stay very enjoyable and pleasant. I have been on tours in other countries and what I particularly appreciate about them and these tours is that there were opportunities set up to help the fellow travelers to bond and to know each other. I had a great time interacting with fellow travelers from all over the world. The only reason that I did not give 5 star rating is that there is not much flexibility in picking and choosing the destination and activities. For those who have done safaris in national parks in Kenya and/or Tanzania you might be disappointed with what you might not get to see in Addo. With that said it is always luck of draw on what you get to see. I also understand that it is a standard tour. For those who wish to have a more tailored experience the agency also offers private tours. After the 8 day tour If I were to come back to S. Africa I would do a private and tailored tour."

We ended up having two guides, Izaac for the vineyards and Maudi for the garden route. Both were great and made sure we were properly settled in and happy with our accommodations.There is a good amount of time spent traveling on the road, but there's no other way to really see everything. Most activities were included and there was no real push for the ones that weren't. We were free to participate or not. The only downside of the trip is there is not much free time to explore the locations and most nights, we are just dropped off at the B&B for sleep and not much else. Overall, a great experience as we saw a lot of South Africa for very little, just wish that they offered a longer tour, so we could have a bit more free time to explore some of the wonderful locations."

I had more than enough possibilities to pictures, but unfortunately we spent a lot of time in the car and did not have enough time to explore the places we stopped either. The guide was really nice and tried to answer all the questions we had concerning the trip. Aditionally he spoiled us with some sweets and ice cream during the trip. The backpackers that were chosen for the nights were cool, especially the one in Cape Agulhas because it is very close to the sea so that we could go for a quick swim in the Indian Ocean. All in all I would really recommend this tour for everyone who does not have lots of time or wants to get a quick overview of the region."

There was high tension as we had a very difficult individual in our tour who wanted all of the activities catered to his every whim (wanted Isaac to be his personal chauffeur, complained that he wasn't allowed to ride the elephants or ostriches, even though it's well-known that these activities are cruel to the animals, to give a few examples) and Isaac made sure this person had a minimal negative impact on the rest of us.

We could get around on our own, take taxis etc. What I did not appreciate is how INDISPENSABLE it would be. To explain, the first day, we went to Table Mountain. Our (excellent) guide, Maudy, drove us there, accompanied us up to the top, and then set us loose for an hour and a half. So I'm thinking, \"did we really need a guide?\" But when it was time to leave, I realized when he left us, he went and started holding our place in line for the descent. He waited an hour and a half in line for us . . . so we did not have to. People were jealous to see us skip the whole line, but hey, have you ever heard of the concept of \"business class\"? Not having to wait in line for an hour and a half was worth every penny. The next day, we had Divan as our guide, and again, just having someone there to facilitate everything for you, drop you off right at the spot while they go search for a parking place, pick you up front and center when you're ready to go . . . having this service really saved our whole trip."

She took us all to have ostrich braai for dinner, which was definitely an experience (other food options were available too) and the next day we went to the Canga Wildlife Ranch, an elephant walk, and a tour of an ostrich farm. Each part was unbelievably fun and interactive and worth every penny. Elephant walk was by far one of our favorite parts, but the wildlife ranch was awesome because we got to play with lemurs and baby cheetahs (the really interactive parts you had to pay for, but because the US dollar is so strong right now it wasn't a big deal for us at all to shell out an extra 20 bucks here and there to actually play with some African animals). Overall, my friend and I agree this was by far the BEST 2 days of our entire trip and we would totally use hotspots2c again for other tours. This was super fun, informative, active and exciting, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to get a taste of Africa in a short amount of time."

I was very impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of this tour operator and would highly recommend booking. The guides were knowledgeable and accommodated the group's needs. I was also impressed with the backpacker accommodations which were clean and offered a fun atmosphere for dinner and socializing with the other travelers. Overall, the tours were well organized and allowed me to see and do a variety of sights in a short amount of time. I had an amazing time in South Africa thanks to HotSpots2c! Thank you!"

Garden Route guide Wessel acquainted us with game life and principles and brought us as close as we ever dreamed to animals.

Our private full day tour of Table Top Mountain and then down the coastal road to the Cape of Good Hope was wonderful. We were able to book a half day tour the next day as we disembarked the ship and then to our flight, seeing the aquarium and botanical gardens on the way.It was our good luck to have Ulrich Damon assigned as our guide.

It's certainly a well organized package that has a diverse array of activities. I was quite pleased with the guest houses that we stayed at as they were in close proximity (i.e. one could walk or take a taxi) to local restaurants. My group consisted of only four persons and thus our tour was more personalized. Xenni (our local guide) was absolutely fantastic as an ambassador for his country. He certainly made every effort to ensure that his clients were well taken care of. South Africa is a beautiful country and if I were to return, I'd definitely contact Hotspots2c!"

It wasn't on the optional list of activities, but crocodile cage diving at the conservation park ranch was also fantastic, as was getting the opportunity to see and pet a cheetah up close.Our guide Kevin was a legend - he always went out of his way to make sure everyone had a great time. We were lucky to have him join us for dinner and post-dinner drinks every evening where he shared lots of great stories and history. We all agreed he was one the best tour guides we've ever had. The hostels were all excellent, great food, locations, and evening socializing. I went for the single rooms which were great. We had a pretty special group indeed...after 5 days in a van together we arrived back in Cape Town and all went out for dinner followed by Karaoke. We definitely have the amazing tour and our guide to thank for making it such a special week."

If you are trying to choose between the 3 or 4 star guesthouses - CHOOSE THE 4 STAR!! The guesthouses were great - and most were oceanview/oceanfront! (just be warned you may be the only one at the 4 star but I was fine with that - Ulrich would pick me up for dinner so you aren't alone all night - and even was nice enough to make a separate trip for me the night I wanted to stay out later w the others at the hostel!The 3 day cape part was spent seeing lots of the famous sights and the garden route combined lots of activities (zip lining, \"adventure cave tours\", safari, canoeing, etc) with amazing views. Be warned the garden route is quite a bit of driving but thanks to frequent stops it wasn't unbearable. The people definitely helped make this trip great but even if you don't hit it off with people it is still one of the most beautiful places I've ever been!I usually don't do tours but for cape town and the southern cape this was perfect! I'd highly recommend Hotspots!"

Big G, our guide for the first three days, made the trip very enjoyable and told us all interesting facts about the Western Cape and was always willing to answer our questions. We, a full bus of young German girls and one English/Dutch guy, visited Cape Point, Hout Bay, we watched wales in Hermanus and took pictures at the most southern tip of Africa. A wine tasting in the amazing wine area as well as a walking tour through the township were also excellent experiences. The stop at the penguin resort is a must. The hostels and the places to eat were always very good. Thank you Big G for this perfect start. Two of us spent the last night of this first part in a lovely hostel in Cape Town city where Zaahid, our tour guide for the next five days, picked us up. We were a very nice small group of five people. In the following days we walked with lions, canoed in the Wilderness, watched a huge herd of elephants in the Addo Park and visited an ostrich farm and the Cango Caves. These are just a few of our fantastic stops. All the hostels were perfect and we spent there very enjoyable evenings. Zaahid is a real gentleman, open-minded, has a great sense of humor, is a good story teller and became a really good friend. From the first moment he integrated every single person into the group and took care that everyone is happy at any time. He always stopped for some pictures at a nice viewpoint and explained a lot about SA and the culture.

The small group size makes it easy to get in touch with the other travellers and have a great time together.I'll definitely come back! Thank you Hotspots team"

Our guide Isaac was fantastic. Adjectives that I would use to describe him are - very knowledgeable, kind, professional, funny, intelligent, prompt, patient, excellent driver, experienced and a 100% amazing person. We enjoyed everything so much. The accommodations were perfect, the activities were a lot of fun and the group was really nice. I even got to symbolically \"adopt\" a cheetah, which is something I will cherish forever. The only thing I had an issue with was the ostrich farm, which I perceived as a cruel and unhappy environment for the birds. This one part just made me sad. Perhaps you may wish to consider another site to visit during this tour. It seemed to me that many folks in our group were saddened by the conditions of the birds as most have huge bald spots where they had ripped out their own feathers due to boredom and frustration - information which the ostrich farm tour guide volunteered himself. Even if they are farm animals they do deserve much more respect in my opinion. I left quite angry and it took a while to calm down. We were really not the only ones who felt this way. But besides this everything else was absolutely wonderful. A big thank you to Isaac, especially for sharing your stories with us and for taking such good care of our group. We will definitely be back for another tour soon. Thank you Hotspots."

The tour was great and encapsulated what we wanted to see from the Garden Route.The only let down was the accommodation, it was not quite up to scratch for what we had paid. It was not clear on booking that if we chose guesthouse accommodation that we would be seperate from the majority of the group who were staying in shared accommodation. This meant the tour guide had to drive us to and from our accommodation to be with the group for the evening and meals, which was sometimes miles out the way (not fair on them when they have been driving all day and need to rest and we want to socialise). We were happy to stay with the group we would have just preferred a private room and bathroom, which wasn't an option on booking. The guesthouse accommodation (which we just thought would be a private room on booking) was satisfactory but not worth what we paid and this let us down. The tour and guide were fantastic, just the accommodation that was the problem."

We went to three different wineries and we started with the best first, Ernie Ells. What a spectacular piece of property and the wines were delicious. The person assisting with the tasting had such a passion for the wines that it showed in every description he gave. We also stopped at two other wineries. One paired their wines with sorbets and the other with dried/cured meats. A whole day event but the time goes quickly. Even the drive from Cape Town was interesting since our driver Gerhard was quite knowledgeable and shared lots of tidbit and fun facts about the regions. He was easy going and laid back and never made us feel rushed throughout the entire day!"

I visited South Africa for five days with work and decided to spend the three nights i had to myself in Cape Town. First of all - the most amazing city I have ever visited !I was picked up on time and after picking up the other people, we set off along the beautifully scenic garden route stopping off to do a 4x4 safari for a couple of hours and then do a lion walk. The lion walk was the highlight of the tour. Walking with the kings of the jungle is just something I will never forget. An overnight stop in Oudtshoorn (pronounced 'oates-urgh-in') in a comfortable family run b&b was done then the ostrich farm, elephant ride (amazing also) and then the wildlife ranch followed before arriving back at my hotel for 6.30pm.Everything mentioned in the itinary was done and for the price, is something i would recommend to everyone. Truly unforgettable and a great way to see the sights outside of the city; which are breath taking.Finally, a special mention to the tour guide Andrew. A top bloke who made sure everyone was ok. Didn't intervene and allowed people to get on with what they wanted to do. I was on my own and he made me feel very welcome. Deserved the big tip I gave him. If you read this mate, again, it was awesome to meet you."

Also, I was under the impression that I would be in a private hotel room since I upgraded but the 3 star accommodation is in someone's actual home!

There was more time driving than we had anticipated, but because the scenery was so breathtaking, we didn't really mind.

I have been waiting to go to a country where I could do this. This was the highlight on my trip.Day 3 Addo Elephant National Park. I was picked up at 4:00 AM to be driven to the park. We went for a 2 hour game ride in a 4x4 vehicle. It looked a lot like an army truck. It was an open truck with a roof and very cold. We were given a poncho. Some people even had blankets. It was so much fun looking for and finding elephants, zebras, flightless dung beetle, and other animals. The African zebras have brown stripes and are very pretty. Took lots of pictures.Day 4 - Rode an Ostrich at the Ostrich Farm. So much fun and went to the Cango caves.

'Z' demonstrated professionalism and a level of cultural sensitivity which gave rise to a strong bond amongst the other tourists (from different countries) which was something I appreciated. He was very knowledgable of the regions we toured, and encouraged questions and dialogue around the culture of SA. Lastly, Zaahid's mission from the start was to have us enjoy every waking moment of the trip, and encouraged us to step out of our comfort zones. Thank you 'Z'! You the man. Second, the trip itself was fantastic. From being picked up on day one, to taking in the beautiful scenery, bungee jumping, riding elephants, speaking to natives, walking with lions, to being dropped off on day three, Spots2c has done a wonderful job coordinating and executing this tour. The trip was done very efficiently and professionally. They pick you up, you load your luggage which is kept locked in a trailer, and you explore South Africa to see phenomenal views, learn about the history and culture and enjoy some adventurous activities. If you're looking for a way to your South Africa, hotspots2c would be the choice, and they offer a variety of packages and durations. Already looking forward to my return to SA."

My favourite travel quote for the most surreal and most amazing experience I had.I joined a 2day Wildlife + Safari tour with Hotspots2c, after counting down the days to my tour it was finally here. Zaahid was our tour guide,and he immediately made you feel welcomed and got us all very excited for our trip which lay ahead. Our first taste of adventure was a 4x4 Game Drive, in the most spectacular game reserve. We were able to see so many wild animals in their natural habitat as well as get a friendly 'hello' by a Giraffe passing by. Next was Walking with lions, I have no idea how to describe how amazing this was, other then the experience was so surreal. From here, we headed to our Backpacker accommodation where we spent the night, and what a fun, lively place it was.We were up bright and early for a wonderful breakfast and then we headed to the elephants, this was my favorite part of the tour!! these animals are so loveable and even showed us how they can even kick a football! At the Cango Wildlife Ranch I got to touch a cheetah and Lemars and go cage dive with the crocs, it was incredible being so close to these wild animals. All in the all this was the most amazing tour, and i was able to tick so many things off my bucket list !"

This tour was great & our tour guide Gerhard was AMAZING!My husband and I took this tour because a friend recommended it and we were so happy we did. It covered so many beautiful places along the Garden Route. We opted for the 4 star B&B stay though we were debating the 3 star v 4 star. The company recommended 4 star because of a night at Buffelsdrift. Well, we didn't know what any of this meant but we took their advice and were so happy! Our accommodations each night were incredible, to say the least. We slept so well and felt like each day was its own mini-vacation in a new part of the country at a new, adorable B&B. And Buffelsdrift was out of this world awesome. It was the best night of our entire 2.5 week trip to South Africa. The tent we stayed in was gorgeous - nicer than the tents we stayed in at our 5 day safari a week later! We saw tons of animals come right to our front door!But, back to Gerhard. He made our trip perfect. He went out of his way to make us comfortable and happy all day, every day. He made reservations for us, drove us to special places/restaurants, and stopped whenever we wanted to see something along the way. Though we paid for the extra safari drive at Addo, our drive through afterward with Gerhard in the van was EVEN BETTER! I know it doesn't make sense that seeing animals from a van could be better than seeing animals from a safari truck but it was better because Gerhard made it so much fun. We went what felt like everywhere in the park with him and saw so many animals. He helped us take pictures and get close to so many great animals.Overall, we'd highly recommend this tour to anyone traveling - as long as you understand it's ideally designed for a younger crowd of backpackers (at least our van was) but we found the value was incredible, the sites were selected perfectly, the accommodations couldn't have been better, and Gerhard made it extraspecial. Thank you Gerhard!!"

We had Zaheed who led this road trip and made it informative and fun! Zaheer - always in control of the drive also made you feel the spirit of Africa - we learnt a few local words and shared many a laughs en route this picturesque journey! My favourite was Jeffreys bay, the canoeing down the wilderness and definitely the trip to ADDO! Although we missed the early morning Safari - the nature gods made up for it - there was an exquisite show of wild animals in their natural habitat and leading them were the elephants - we just loved the sights and sounds of the nature reserve. being our honeymoon - Hotspots arranged a special night at a private game reserve - this was the icing on the cake and made such a difference to our trip. I liked the fact that the trip was not packed with activities - it had its share of adventure but also ample time for relaxation! Keep it up Hotspots!"

Drive back, albeit a long drive (but plenty of stops incl Ronnies for Milkshakes) was spectacular. Gerhard was very friendly and knowledgeable and really went out of our way to make sure everyone was looked after. He was organised and had lunch and dinner preordered on our first day. We stayed in 3 star accom as we didn't know how great the backpackers hostel was and we upgraded to the guest house. Wish we stayed at the backpackers as it seemed great fun. Gerhard kindly arranged for us to eat at the hostel with the group (amazing BBQ) and Gerhard dropped us back to our accommodation! If you want a 2 day trip down the garden route to go on safari- do this! It's great value and was the highlight of our South African holiday! There are extras if you wish to pay (loin walk, elephant feeding, various cango encounters etc). We did some as it's a once in a lifetime experience! Please pass on our compliments to Gerhard!"

Our guide for the 4 x4 did not offer blankets and we all were frozen so if you are going out on this be sure to dress warm. And I mean warm! It is spring and we still froze. Saw lions, rhinos,giraffes,zebras, ostrich and their babies. Wasn't too happy with this guide but overall, this part was good. The accommodations we had at a bAnd b were perfect. Walking distance to sweet little restaurant called nostalgia. Delicious food. The only drawback there was no wifi at B and B so we couldn't check our iPad pics.The second day of safari was fun! Started with elephant walk. Again, Isaac was helpful! That was my favorite part! Then we went to a animal reserve. A great second day.. We also walked with the lions and that was amazing but scary. My friend did a cheetah meet and liked it.Overall, I enjoyed it and we stopped at Ronnie's sex shop for burgers and chips on way back. Get your cameras ready.

Other alternatives were given to the group which was very good!!! (Not mentioning being stuck in mud hahaha) Fun & games. Loved this weekend - would enjoy taking part in a longer tour tooKeep up the good workI'm sure Charlene deserves a promotion!!!!"

Both exceeded my expectations. Zaahid, my bus driver, was by far the coolest guide I had ever met. He was always willing to go out of his way to help us and make sure we saw and did everything. Definitely some of the best times I had in SA. Definitely perfect for college-age people looking for an awesome, thrill-filled time."

I booked two of the Hotspots2c tours during my visit to Capetown .... their 3-day Western Cape WOW tour and their 2-day Wildlife and Safari. I loved them both! Inexpensive, yet completely memorable! The WOW tour made stops in Hout Bay, Cape Point, Cape of Good Hope, Stellenbosch for wine tastings at two wineries, Cape Agulhas, Hermanus, and Betty's Bay (to see the penguin colony). A tour of the Kayamandi Township and Chapman's Peak Drive were included, as well as the (optional) opportunity to go shark cage diving or whale-watching. Talk about seeing everything in one tour! The Wildlife and Safari tour drove the famous Route 62 and included a mini 4x4 big 5 game drive on a wildlife reserve, time at the Cango Ostrich Farm and Wildlife Ranch with opportunities to interact with various animals, an elephant ride at an elephant rescue reserve, and a lion walk. Again, so many unique, memorable experiences all in one weekend!If/when we return to South Africa, I won't hesitate to book tour with Hotspot2c again!!!"

What a great guy Xenny is, an excellent guide, friendly and enthusiastic, he really looked after us all, nothing was too much to ask of him.We headed out to Oudtshoorn after collecting everyone for the tour, it took about six hours drive from Cape Town but Xenny allowed plenty of stops for us. We managed to pack so much into the 2 days \u2013 but the highlights for us were the elephant experience, lion walk and the 2 hour safari game drive. We also paid extra and stayed in a game lodge for the night instead of the hostel which really added to the experience.The tour was excellent value for money and brilliant at ticking everything off what we wanted to see on our trip, we would definitely recommend using this company, but please note it is aimed more for the younger backpackers/volunteers as it is very active."

We were picked up from our hotel with baggage and generous welcomed and treated well during the trip, even during our visit to the ostrich farm I started to feel bad and Mr. Z drove me to a pharmacy after dropping the others and our bags to the backpackers. the route was great we did all that we expected to do in South Africa in a short time period; safari, bungee jumping, sight seeing, getting close to the animals, Canoeing in a beautiful river with a short swim. We were older than the rest of our traveling companions in our late thirties and Mr. Z made sure we were part of the group at all times and kept us all in good spirits thought out the trip talking and answering questions at correct times whilst keeping quiet when the travel required, his driving skills were very useful specially around some of the crazy drivers, he never put our lives in danger and always had time for stop break or a quick sightseeing moment.Hotspots 2 c organized accommodation passes and lunches in quality places with great landscapes and history for us to gain many photos of our dream holiday. We recommend hotspots tours If you visit the Cape and the garden route. Thanks to this tour we did all we expected to do and more in our travel to South Africa, we think that if we would not did this tour our experience there would be lost to booking accommodation, organizing cars and routes and it would be stress and tiring from drivingKind regards,Derek and Eva"

He was very attentive to our needs. While at an ATM he stepped in and protected us from some very sketchy people who got to close while we were using it. He made sure we were safe at our hostel/guesthouse every night. If he wasn't able to take us back to our lodging at night (because we liked staying out late for dinner) he made sure we had a way to get back safely. The guesthouses/lodgings were clean, safe and comfortable. In some, the views were beautiful! Breakfasts were standard. Eggs cooked to your preference, a variety of cereals and yogurt, lots of fruits. The staff, at the majority of the places, made us feel welcome and at home.Maudi promised that we would see elephants after our very disappointing 0600 game drive. We were all skeptical. He drove back into the park in our tour van and lo and behold!! We saw tons of elephants, buffalo, kudu, dung beetles, and mongooses.He also knows lots of good places to eat. One night we requested ostrich for dinner. He made arrangements and we had delicious ostrich kebabs and sausages!Every day was an adventure!!! We couldn't decide which one we liked most each day. :) There was also lots of down time to rest and relax. I definitely recommend hotspots2c to anyone wanting to see South Africa and experience some memorable adventures!"

My partner and I went a tour of the Garden Route with this tour company and we found it became the most enjoyable part of our entire two-week trip to Cape Town and also our favourite of all the tours we went on. The booking service through their website was excellent with prompt email confirmation of payment and details of trip. On the morning of pick-up we were collected on time and were so relieved to have been greeted by such a friendly, helpful and easy-going tour guide (Isaac). Unlike a particularly annoying tour guide we had encountered from another company a few days before (which almost put us off from going on any other tours!), Isaac was friendly without being too intrusive and too over-enthusiastic/loud. He was also amazingly helpful and accommodating throughout the whole of our tour, and the fact that he was able to maintain this while managing several young adults on such a tight schedule was hugely impressive. The same can be said of his driving skills! The van was also very comfortable even at high speed along the N2. Personal possessions were kept safe and secure at times in the van and locked trailer. The activities included in the itinerary were also first-class. If you enjoy outdoor activities (kayaking, swimming, climbing, bungee-jumping) and wildlife/nature experiences you will not be disappointed! Accommodation was also excellent. As me and my partner are slightly older we chose the guesthouse options which (although beautiful) we later regretted as the backpacker hostels were much trendier and equally as comfortable! Most fun could be had at the hostels in the evenings and the food/drink at these hostels were both cheap and delicious. We wished we had booked a private room in the hostel instead, especially as the others on our tour who stayed at the hostel were so friendly and fun-loving.I was quite worried before I went on this tour that it would be too rushed, as we had heard from other people that 72 hours to cover the Garden Route would not be enough. Well I could not disagree more - we were able to cover both Route 62 and the whole of the Garden Route along the N2 within this time without feeling rushed at all. This was due to the supreme planning and organisation of hotspots2c, and the well-paced and interesting itinerary/route. We had also originally planned to hire a car and explore the Garden Route ourselves, but I can honestly say that we wouldn't have seen or experienced half the things we did on this tour if we had done so. So in short, I would throughly recommend doing any tour with this company. They are enjoyable, extremely well-planned and well-executed and a bonus is that they are relatively cheap as well so provide excellent value for money."

Not only do I recommend them in the highest of regards, but quite frankly there is no other way to see South Africa! From start to finish Hotspots was professional, timely, accommodating, and flexible with my group. My most recent trip with Hotspots was a special one at that. With Hotspots help I was able to plan and organize a trip with a group of less privileged children I'd been working with. After living and teaching in the Township of Kayamandi, for 4 months, it became mine and a friends goal to provide a few of these awesome kids with the chance to see and experience their own beautiful country. With that idea I knew exactly who to contact and Hotspots helped us out every step of the way! If you'd like to read more about our trip feel free to visit, www.OSullivansTravels.com I can't express enough how amazing our trip was and the impaction it will forever have on those children. I'll forever be thankful of the friendship I've made with Hotspots. To make things even better, we had my great friend Isaac as our tour guide. This man in legendary and a true master of guides. I really appreciate everything you do and look forward to our next adventure together!NdiyaKuthana Hotspots2cSincerely,Chris O'Sullivan"

The trip was really nice including all the accommodations where we were staying, the food we were eating, the information we were getting and all the excursions as well. Within those 4 days I was riding an elephant and an ostrich, I climd through tight caves, visited beautiful landscapes and did the bungy jump. What I really like about the tour is that the guests were young and that everybody could experience as much of the nightlife as they wanted. They could get wild at night or just rest for the next day.Thank you very much again."

When we started the tour, one thing was obvious: this group is tiptop especially our tourguide Isaac who tends to exaggerations and ironic statements. When we went to such \"dangerous\" and \"life-threatening\" trips he always wanted to make sure if we left our creditcards in the car just for the case we wouldn't come back alive. Isaac is always good for some jokes :) Not only the guide but also the tour on the whole with all the places we went to were simply great! Elefant riding, ostrich farm, mysterious and challenging cango caves, relaxing boat trip, best thing in the world: bungy jump of the world's highest bridge, really advisable; shopping in the outlet stores of billabong and Co. at j-bay, nice hiking through tsitsikama nationalpark, swimming in the indian ocean, big5 game drive etc... Absolutely exciting, never boring, so many expressions and so much to see. Also the hostels were a dream, 2 of them directly at the beach, very clean and nice furnishing. So in general the 4 day Garden Route Tour is definitely a good choice and worth the money. It includes impressions and experiences you won't forget and shouldn't miss. Also the funniest guide in the world Isaac contributed to this great adventure :-) "

Our first stop , Ronnie`s Sex Shop, which is legend on Route 65.At the ostrich farm we learnt all about the amazing bird and got to ride and feed them .Then off to ride and feed the elephants. What a great time we had, the elephants are so gentle. WOW what an experience. Sunday after breakfast it was off to the Cango Wildlife Ranch , where we were taken around by a very knowledgeable guide , then we had the opportunity to have one on one encounters with some of the animals . Tigers, Lemurs, and Cheetahs to mention a few. Our last stop a 2 hour game drive where we got to see all the Big 5 . There were plenty stops along the way to grab a bite to eat and drink. If you want to see tons of animals I highly recommend this trip and price wise it is worth every cent spent.Thank you all at Hotspots2c for an AWESOME weekend ."

Isaac(3-day) and Xenny (4-day) were incredibly FANTASTIC guides and became great friends! As well as teaching us so much they were so fun as well! This is why i did two tours with Hotspots, because the guides really did all they could to make it great, by being flexible and chilled taking time to stop off and spend longer time at certain points on the tour we enjoyed, asking us if everything was okay and would let us do any extra activities we would like along the way! I went with the budget option, which meant i stayed in dorm rooms in hostels, and this was definitely a great option, as not only did you make friends on your own tour, but also could make friends with other travelers in the hostels. All the hostels were very well chosen, as they allowed the tour to flow seamlessly without any long trips to get there, and they were clean and comfortable!I'm so so glad I went on these fantastic tours, and despite originally thinking I would never do a bungy jump, I did the world's highest!

We did a game drive on the first day before spending the night in a fab hostel where we had the tastiest braii (big BBQ) and played pool in the hostel bar all evening where we mad plenty of friends. The following day was crammed full of unforgettable experiences. We got to spend the morning with 3 elephants where we hand fed them and got to have photos while sitting on their knees or backs. It was incredible to get up so close to these majestic animals. From there we went to an ostrich farm which is definitely an experience you won't forget as you see people ride them and attempt to kiss them. Finally we stopped at cango animal ranch where you ge to see lots of different animals in a zoo like setting but get taken round by a guide which is very informative. Here we were abl to pay a little extra to get up close with some of the animals including white tiger cubs, lemurs, snakes or cheetahs. I spent time cuddling the cheetahs which was unbelievable they were so tame and purred away while you stroked them. Fabulous company to do a safari with as you get to do so many more things with them."

Highlights of the trip would have to be the cage diving with the great white sharks - a must do for any adrenaline junkies out there - and just generally traveling around the coast taking in the amazing scenery of south africa. Definitely recommend this tour and this company and plan on taking another safari tour with them in the near future."

I have enjoyed it very much!!!We visited so many wonderful places and main attaractions of the Route (Cape Town-Mossel Bay- Wilderness-Knysna-Tsitsikama National Park-Natures Valey-Pletentberg Bay-Oudtshoorn) in 4 days! We did canoe on a river, visited elephant park (fed them and walked with them), ostrich farm, jumbed from the highest bridge (260 m)- bungy jumpinig, got some tan on the beach, intered the Camgo Cave! Every day was an adventure! Organization and accomodation (backpackers) were perfect! Our guide, Johan, was very knowledgeable and flexible. He tried to do everything in the best way and comfortable for the people! Highly recommend to do this tour to everyone who comes to South Africa!I think that this is the best way to visit Garden Route if you do not have a car or can not drive. Cost of a trip was absolutely affordable. Thank you very much for this trip! Karina, 24 years, Russia"

We thought we'd be too tired to fully appreciate our private tour, but we were so wrong. Rob is an extremely educated, interesting and engaging guide. We spent the first 15 minutes discussing what would be most interesting for us personally. We loved that this day was tailor made to our liking. We had many opportunities to stop in different areas in and around CapeTown. There was no question that Rob couldn't answer, and his insights into everything from people to food to history were enlightening and intelligent. He shared his own background which helped us fully understand the complexity of the South Africa people, as well as showing us the similarities between all people. He was willing to stop at a moment's notice for anything from a photo op to an impromptu shopping spree. We have no hesitation in recommending Rob to anyone, regardless of age or interests, for a memorable touring experience! Thanks Rob:)"

Rob's honesty, friendliness and desire to help us make this a trip of a lifetime was apparent from the start. During the next few months Rob and I stayed in touch and he was so helpful when I asked him about the best restaurants to try and things I should know before we came.We only had three days in CT and Rob greeted us with a smile and a map of the area on our second day. He was genuinely interested in personalizing our day to fit our needs and interests. For example we were more interested in seeing what the locals do, the best vineyard, restaurants and city highlights than standing in line to go to the top of Table Mountain.One of our stops was the Botanical Gardens and we were thrilled to have Rob explain the fauna and its importance to the ecosystem of South Africa and CT. It was a beautiful park and wish we could have spend more time exploring with him. We went to the Penguin colony where we learned their plight and the dwindling numbers. Our highlight was a respite from the day when we stopped t a beautiful winery and sampled some of the local wines, relaxed and took in the view before goign to lunch and one of Rob's favourite places that we would never have known about.While we did not go to up Table Mountain we did go to the hill (forgot the name) across from it and took beautiful pix of the mountain and city below. Rob also took us to a special surprise to learn about what can be done to recycle tea bags and help locals earn a living. That is all I am going to say as I don't want to ruin the surprise.I am sure I have left some things out??? We absolutely loved CT and there is no doubt we will be back to spend a month next time. If you are looking for a knowledgeable guide and a friend for your special trip you don't need to look any further. Rob was amazing and made our time in CT very special. My only regret is we did not hire him again the next day to take us to the Winelands as he has a farm (winery) there and would have definitely given us the 5 star tour there too. Instead we had rented a car but with his recommendations of some incredible wineries we had a wonderful two days in Franschhoek and Stellenbosch too.Thank you Rob."

However, Rob will never bore you with details unless you ask him to! It was very interesting to spend the day someone who was born during apartheid and lived through it all those years. Rob will not take you to the typical places in the Winelands area (unless you want him to). Instead, we went to a vineyard and did a very informative food and wine pairing as well as a very interesting tour of the winemaking facility. In addition we went to a local chocolatier for a fun and educational chocolate tasting (I'm a chocaholic and I loved this stop). I can't say enough nice things about Rob and I highly recommend him as a guide when you visit Cape Town!!"

Lunch at a farm restaurant was outstanding. Our second day was to Stellenbosch where Rob treated us to a personal tour of a winery and a fascinating lesson in the local wines and how to appreciate them with different foods, an experience that we shall never forget. On to Franschhoek for lunch and afterwards a visit to a chocolatier. Our only regret is that the tour was so captivating that we didn't have enough time to visit all the other attractions in this wonderful area. We cannot recommend Rob too highly and when we return to this beautiful region we shall certainly seek his services again."

My wife and I had gone on tours the previous two days, both very good, and we were tired and not feeling especially well. We had already booked the day's tour, though, so we decided to power through. Thank goodness. Our day with Rob in February 2016 was, by far, the most fun/educational/culturally enlightening experience in Cape Town. We told Rob in advance that we were interested in a tour focusing on South Africa's food culture. We went to a terrific breakfast at a bacon-themed restaurant, followed by a walk around Central Cape Town, including food markets and shops. Rob, knowing we were slightly under the weather, made plenty of time to stop frequently and adjusted the pace to our energy levels. After lunchtime, we headed toward a winery, where we enjoyed cheese and some very good wine, in between Rob broadening our minds with Cape Town and South Africa culture, politics and customs. He can speak intelligently on many, many topics and has his own interesting back story, but perhaps more impressive, Rob is a great listener. Almost without us realizing it, he customized a day to our personalities and interests, picking up little hints in our conversations and steering our tour toward sights and experiences that would satisfy those interests. You know how sometimes after a day-long tour, you're kind of ready for it to end? It's easy to be tired and ready to just move on. Well after our day with Rob, which lasted from around 9 a.m. till about 6 p.m., we were sad there wasn't more on the to-do list or another day with Rob. If we had cancelled the tour, we would've never known how much we would've missed. As it is, I have only one regret: I should've booked all three days with Rob. He's the absolute best tour guide I've ever had."

He is the ultimate authority on Cape Town & South Africa, if you choose the wine country, I think he owns it. Everybody is his friend and you get to see and taste everything, we had a great time. I really think he should raise his prices because he goes over the top and charges so little, we loved Davis and so will you!"

We did a half-day city tour and a full day trip to the Cape of Good Hope. With a week in Cape Town, we thought it would be nice to have a mix of guided tours and time to independently wander around. We also thought that a one-on-one tour would help us see more of Cape Town, rather than a guided tour with a large group.We had the absolute BEST time with Rob. Each day we chatted before our tour began, so that Rob could learn a little about us and our interests. He was so knowledgeable about Cape Town history and took us to a few placesin the city that only the locals would really know about. On our full day trip to the Cape of Good Hope, we talked through possible pit stops based on what we'd like to see - including the African penguin colony, lunch on a self-sustaining farm, and Chapman's Peak.Not only did we learn a lot, but we found ourselves laughing a whole lot, too. Rob is funny and personable. He loved learning about our culture and life at home just as much as we liked learning about South African culture. He even gave us some great suggestions of activities to do in our free time, and restaurants to check out that were around our hotel. We took him up on a lot of these suggestions and they did not disappoint.If we have the opportunity to return to Cape Town for another visit, I would absolutely find time to tour with Rob again."

Rob Davidowitz was recommended to us by friends as a knowledgeable tour guide in Cape Town. Our original intention was to have Rob show us historic Cape Town, but a large labour demonstration in the downtown area dictated a change of plans. Rob came up quickly with an alternative. Our first stop was Kirstenbosche National Botanical Garden. Rob's knowledge of the myriad plants including their historical uses was impressive.Rob then took us to Beau Constantia winery and got us admitted before normal opening time. The view of the tablelands below and the wine tastings were outstanding.Next, we visited the Steenberg Estate and ate lunch at their \"Sixteen82 Bistro\". The Angelfish in tomato and chickpea stew was delicious.Finally, Rob escorted us to the T-Bag handicraft factory in Hout Bay. This cottage industry based on the use of donated used tea bags supports several local artisans and their artwork is quite unique.Rob was courteous, knowledgeable and professional throughout and has an infectious love for his homeland. We had a wonderful time sightseeing and conversing with him about South Africa. We would recommend Rob most highly"

He loves his city, and it shows. And, by the time you return home he summarizes all of the topics you talked about and provides active links for each. Just a great experience.Like others, I booked Rob way in advance, and despite having had knee surgery the previous week, he was up driving and walking about with us from the start. His knowledge of Cape Town is great, and we really enjoyed our three days together. Whether you visit the wine country, the city, or the headlands, every day was fun and unique. Rob has an interesting and diverse personal history which helps add a lot of color and light to the places we went.

Once again, fellow reviewers, you have come through!I booked Rob about 8 months in advance of the trip, which I get the sense is a good idea, as he appears to lead a busy, full life both guiding, winemaking and traveling on his own. I asked for one day on the peninsula and one in wine lands.As others have described, the first 20-30 minutes are spent planning OUR day (not Robs). A very useful map is marked up with a combination of arrows circles and Rob's little designs as we decide what to do that day.I could go into detail about all the stops that are similar to the other reviews, but I think that its more useful to tell you that Rob's main goal is not to show you stuff. Its to challenge you, to make you think, to engage you in thoughtful intelligent conversation about the people, the food, the wine (and yes, the chocolate).We spent much of our road time discussing personal interests, politics (South African and American) and social issues. We stopped at out of the way places for lunch that gave us a local flavor. The stores and businesses we visited were definitely out of the ordinary.This is the type of experience that I think a lot of us crave when we travel... not just to have our picture taken next to some distant sign, but to make us think. Rob succeeds in doing that for you. And while he may sometimes come across as having a strong opinion, its far outweighed by his knowledge and love for the city and region he lives in.Thanks Rob!!!"

My husband was also there but with his rugby team and actually chose to spend the day with me/my friend instead of the team so that he could go on Rob's tour. That's how awesome Rob is. Although I interviewed multiple tour companies, I knew that Rob would be our guy right away. I was able to schedule everything through email, he was incredibly helpful/informative/flexible, and super easy going. When he picked us up in the morning, we went over all of our options and he tailored a trip to our interests. It's a private tour so he's able to do this and I HIGHLY recommend that. We saw such a unique side of Cape Town, and one that totally interested us personally. Since Rob is a local with endless knowledge and endless connections (it seemed that everyone knew and loved him), he took us to places off the regular path and he knew so much about the country and the areas we were in. He's incredibly friendly, funny, knowledgeable, and well-traveled. So basically he's just a great guy to spend a day with whether you're on a tour or not. We spent a whole day with him and couldn't believe how fast it went! If you're going to Cape Town and want to do any tours - choose Rob!

At the start of each tour Rob highlighted a map of the route and what we would achieve during day. Every attraction that I requested was worked into my tour, and much more was added in culture, history and even geology. Rob's tour is a great way to see Cape Town and surrounding peninsula. Both the city and peninsula are equally enlightening and entertaining. Rob is truly an ambassador for Cape Town. \"Must Do\" tour recommendation !"

Our group of four seasoned travellers were absolutely delighted that we chose to begin our three-week trip to South Africa with Rob's Cape Cuisine tour. We started the day with his home-cooked 'bushman's breakfast backdropped by Table Mountain, toured the inspiring Khayelitsha (township) gourmet biscuit business, and then enjoyed ethnically-diverse food-tastings and warm hospitality in family homes on opposite ends of the city. As we drove between venues, Rob provided an engaging, lively commentary and Q+A - the perfect introduction to South Africa and Cape Town. Highly recommended - if you are lucky, he will be available for more than the one day we were able to book."

We just explained what we liked and he did the rest. Like oaked Chardonnay - no worries we can stop at Glen Carlou, like chocolate - I will just add chocolate tasting at the end. This was our favourite day of the whole trip and this was down to Rob. There may be many other guides out there but there is only one Rob. What he doesn't know about wine or Cape Town in general probably isn't worth knowing. Some of his food pairings were inspired and really original. Stem ginger - wow! A truly private tour provided by a true gentleman."

I mention this because it is not usually the case when traveling abroad with most taxi drivers and even many tour operators and you hope you survive the day!

From the very first minute, when he promptly picked us up in our Capetown hotel, to our sad farewell ... it was non-stop learning, laughs, top quality food, insanely good wine, tasty local craft beer, and decadent chocolate. Rob ticked all our important boxes:WINE - We don't get a lot of exposure to SA wine in the US, so this was an eye-opener. Visiting wine farms with a wine connoisseur and a winemaker (yes, Rob makes MCC sparkling wine) was a precious experience. Learning about the local varietals, and food pairing -- really amazing, even for us ... and we consider ourselves wine-o's! All this, put against the backdrop of scenic Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, and Paarl, made it priceless. Our favorite was Beyerskloof Pinotage Reserve, for it's full body complexity and price point.FOOD - Rob wisely chose the perfect lunch spot, Pierneef a La Motte, within La Motte Winery. The design of the place is modern, and the food was \"a modern take on classic SA dishes.\" Again, very fair price point for the quality of food.CHOCOLATE - To be honest, I was skeptical about this \"bean to bar\" tasting experience. But this was the perfect way to end our day. It was a quick \"around the world\" trip in real chocolate, not the overprocessed sugar bars we know. I will never taste chocolate in the same way again.EXPERIENCE - As he says in his website, Rob delivers on providing a unique, private, once-in-a-lifetime experience. Our only regret was that Rob was unavailable to tour us on our other days in town (and we made reservations over 6 months ago!)Trust Rob, let him plan a great day for you, and soak in every minute. He is an encyclopedia of knowledge, passionate about what he does, and genuinely fun to be around. One last piece of advice ... book him early!"

He has excellent knowledge of the history and socio-political and economic issues of the country and we were delighted to hear it from someone who has experienced the great things which South Africa affords and can provide some insight to the past history which a North American sees only though the filtered eyes of the media.What was most impressive was what he taught us about the wine industry, how to undertake a proper wine tasting experience and his exclusive access and permissions he enjoys at many fine vineyards in the region.We strongly recommend Rob to fellow travellers and would hope we have the opportunity to visit again and spend another day with Rob exploring new venues.Thanks to Rob for a great day and an excellent start to our trip in South Africa and thanks to fellow trip advisor reviewers who helped us to find Rob."

It's a great way to tour to Pinguin Island and is see Cape of Good Hope and the coastal towns, especially if you don't want to drive. Rob came and got us at our hotel and we sat down with him to decide what we wanted to see and he made great recommendations. He is very friendly and has a wealth of information about the Cape area, wineries and general history of the area. We spent the day with him and wished we could of booked more days. Be sure to book in advance as his schedule gets booked up fast. It was a sheer pleasure to spend the day with him."

We went to a couple of different wineries, a chocolate factory and a brewery along with a stop for some fine dining. We spent a fantastic day with Rob tasting wine, learning about the industry. Rob knows his stuff and is very happy to share his talents and skills with anyone interested.

Rob arrived early on the first day with his maps to show us where we would be travelling and with suggested stops along the way. We chose those that were of interest to us and then set off. Rob was full of information about Cape Town and his life and experiences. We quickly established a comfortable relationship, one which continued through our two days together. Our two trips were certainly off the tourist track for the most part and a highlight of our trip to Africa. Rob has a wonderful knowledge of food & wine and we shared lunch at 2 absolutely amazing restaurants that we would not have visited without him. We felt we were tripping around Cape Town with an old friend! I would recommend Rob to anyone wanting to have an enjoyable unique experience while they were visiting Cape Town. He always answers questions promptly and is happy to accommodate requests. Once again Rob many thanks for an unforgettable experience!!"

The best way for me to describe the two days spent visiting the Cape Wine Regions, and Cape Peninsula areas with Rob, earlier this month, was the feeling that I was an honoured guest, and that he was delighted to have the opportunity to share his love and passion of his homeland with me. On both days, Rob arrived early, equipped with laminated maps, which he used to chart proposed routes, based on my interests. Both of the excursions were peppered with interesting facts, regional and social history, and surprizing methods of conveying information! Rob is well informed, flexible, well prepared, and thoughtful- If that wasn\u2019t enough, he listened to everything that I said, so that he could create a catered tour. He has a knack for small details that enriched the overall experience (a small welcoming gift, with an explanation of African Tribal customs, and on the second day a box of Rooibos Tea, in follow up to a conversation of the previous day, as examples). I was also very impressed by the \u201cwelcome home\u201d e-mail I received the day I returned to Canada, which included links to topics of interest from the two days spent in Rob\u2019s company, as well as an overview of the two days. The highest endorsement I can provide is the statement that I would be happy to recommend Rob\u2019s services to my family and loved ones, and I would do so, without hesitation. Thanks Rob, for helping to make my adventures in South Africa amazing!!!"

I reached out to him about 4months before we were expected in Cape Town and booked his services for 2-days of our 5-day visit. We were traveling with our family of 5 (3 kids ages 7, 12, 14). Rob was on time, his van was immaculate and beautiful and comfortable for an all day drive. He was so engaging with our entire family. He got the kids involved in wanting to know and understand the history of not only Cape Town but South Africa. He knows a lot about everything, a truly amazing conversationalist. He is also a very passionate about Cape Town and enjoys sharing all of it's beauty with you. We would highly recommend Rob to anyone interested in seeing and learning about Cape Town and South Africa, our two days with him (a Cape of Good Hope and Winelands tour), was definitely our highlight of Cape Town and of our trip to South Africa.We can't recommend highly enough!

He asked us questions about the type of wine that we like to drink which helped him to figure out the best areas for us to visit. He even brought a laminated map that he drew on to show us where we were and where we would be going. Rob brought us behind the scenes at on of the vineyards where he produces sparkling wine. We had the opportunity to see the machinery and he walked us through the process. He took our wine tasting to a new level by showing us how to pair different wines with different foods. He brought snacks and allowed us to taste them and sip the wine to determine what we liked. We had a delicious lunch at another vineyard. After lunch Rob let us choose what to do next. We decided to do a chocolate tasting. The chocolate tasting allowed us to taste raw, unadulterated chocolate made from beans from different parts of the world. We never felt any pressure to buy wine. The wine tour was about learning about the region, the grapes, the wine making process, and just having fun. Rob is very easy to talk to. It was like spending the day with a friend. He even gave us tips about how to spend the rest of our time in Cape Town. I would highly recommend this tour."

Rob was a wonderful guide. He clearly LOVES his city and country and was able to answer our many questions about it. He's also quite the foodie and recommended amazing breakfast and lunch places for our tour--as well as a dinner place for us to go to on our own that we also really enjoyed. I was a little afraid that the day would be a lot of driving, but with the well-planned stops Rob had in store we never drove for more than 40 minutes or so without stopping. The van was very comfortable as well. All in all, it was a very memorable day!"

He was at our hotel at the appointed time and we sat down to hear and discuss options for the day. I loved his maps and his ability to write upside down to show us more about each possibility. When we decided on our favorites, he then told us about how much time each would take and what we could reasonably fit into the day. Having agreed upon an itinerary, we started out at Kirstenbosch Gardens, where Rob was a wealth of information about the plants that we were able to see in our hour-plus visit. The garden is worth a day, if you have the time, but we didn't. From there were went to a little fishing village and saw the day's catch that would appear at Cape Town Restaurants that night, then on to Boulder Beach to see the penguins and to the Cape of Good Hope. Our trip up the western side of the cape was filled with beautiful scenery--very different from the eastern side-- and included a delicious lunch at a deli in Noordhoek. We ended the day with a drive around the City Central and more information about Cape Town. Rob was a perfect guide--knowledgeable, genial, flexible--and just a lot of fun. During the day we learned so much about the history and culture of the Cape in addition to the places we went. We were very pleased with everything, and would highly recommend spending a day--or more--with him. It exceeded our expectations and we were delighted that everything was so well communicated via the Internet in advance and we had no surprises about anything except the beauty and the enjoyment of our experience."

However, I was not prepared for such a blow-away day - it was great. Rob was skilled enough to keep all of us engaged - which when the party includes a 21 and 18 year old isn't always easy! I never thought I would see my kids interested in Botanical Gardens - but they were totally engaged with Rob. In summary, Rob is a thoroughly nice person and a total professional who will share with you a plethora of facts and comments about what you are seeing - and much of what you are not!

I asked him about Table Mountain and he said the gondola was closed that morning due to inclement weather, after checking a site on his phone, but would check again later.Rob was informative, friendly, and talkative. He took us to the botanical gardens, a fish market, and the penguins. After lunch, I asked again about Table Mountain and he checked quickly and said it was still closed due to high winds. He dropped us off an hour early, 4:30pm, at our hotel. We could have gone to one or two more stops, especially if we had made a much shorter visit to his friend's tea bag shop.When we got back, we decided to hike up to the gondola. When we got there it had just closed for the day. Two people told us it had been operating throughout the day with no problems. Rob could have just dropped us off there if he didn't want to go up.He seems to be a nice guy, and this contrasts with all the other reviews, but I don't appreciate being lied to."

We decided that a Wine and Chocolate Tour was the tour that suited us best. We had such a wonderful time with Rob and he taught us a lot about the wine country and about chocolate. The wine country is so beautiful, you can not go wrong with this tour. Rob made it all the better!"

Even the manager at my hotel was impressed by how he sat down with me and discussed our options for the day to maximise my time and to see what I wanted to see. He listened to what I wanted and had pre-booked the most amazing lunch for us at La Colombe! I spent only one day with Rob as my tour guide (and he also adopted me into his family for another day of fun but that's another story). I would highly recommend that you travel around Cape Town with Rob. The whole process of booking through to the actual day of the tour was extremely professional. I had an absolute blast and I look forward to returning to Cape Town in the future and spending more time with Rob."

Before our 3 day trip to Cape Town I took to trip advisor to find a tour to get the most out of our trip in the limited timeframe we had available. Trip Advisor didn't let me down with this one, I found Rob and his incredible collection of reviews, all of them I can now confirm are completely justified. I made contact with our dates and requirements and very swiftly got a response that I could see had been composed with time, care & attention to detail. I knew at this point I had stumbled upon a real gem, I was sold and booked our tour of the Cape Peninsular. Rob collected us from our hotel & gave us loads of information about the things we would have the opportunity to see during the day. This allows Rob to get a feel for what you are interested in and cherry pick the best places to take you. We decided upon a visit to a fishing village, Simon's Town, the penguin colony at Boulders beach (a must), and down to the Cape of Good Hope. We then drove back along Chapman's peak drive which, although much shorter is even more beautiful than the Big Sur coastline on highway 1 in California. Lunch was taken at The Food Barn Deli, the food was fantastic & atmosphere outstanding. Our final stop of the day was at the Kirstenbosch Gardens, another great spot that we will defiantly visit again to spend more time exploring if & when we visit Cape Town in the future. One of the things that made our day even better was spotting Whales just of the coast on no less than four occasions. Whales had not be discussed at all until the first time we spotted them just of shore, Rob very quickly noticed our interest and adjusted the plan to suite. For the rest of the day he was on the lookout and stopping to look at every opportunity. The whole day from start to finish was magic. Rob is probably one of the most knowledgable & charismatic people I have ever had the privilege to meet. He is truly passionate about Cape Town & South Africa and I cannot think of a single way he could have made our day better. His wealth of knowledge seems to know no bounds, from South Africa, Cape Town, the rest of the world, Animals, Geology, Botany, History, Politics, right through to English tv & Top Gear. There was never a dull or quiet moment.I now consider Rob to be a friend in Cape Town and I recommend you look no further for your trip to Beautiful Cape Town. A return trip to Cape Town will not be far around the corner and I know one of the first things that will be arranged is a tour or two with Rob. Thanks so much."

Our wine tour was fantastic and Rob's knowledge was first rate. We went to real wineries, not tourist traps, and were able to get right into the heart of the operation. Our other stops included a city tour of Stellenbosch, a FABULOUS outdoor farm barbeque and table mountain. At every turn Rob had more facts and information, was open to any questions we had (regardless of how ridiculous or politically sensitive) and was enthusiastic and constantly engaging. This is especially good considering the range of ages and professions withing our large group.

We probably did more than some people, and probably less than others, but whatever we did, Rob made our adventure very memorable and with the feeling that we would want to go back some day to have him show us more. At the end of the day, I felt that we had experienced the very essence of Cape Town and it's culture. One cannot ask more than that from a guide showing you his Cape Town as he sees it."

Day One was the Peninsula Tour which included many beautiful sights including the Penguins and Table Mountain. We particularly liked the local flavor though: visiting the fish market and the lady who makes collectibles out of tea bags. Had a lovely lunch at the Food Barn. Day Two we visited the wine country. Rob is a partner in Villiera Wine Farm in Stellenbosch and he is quite the expert in wine making and more importantly, wine tasting :). The tasting was quite informative as we paired wines with food with surprising results, not your normal wine tasting. Off to lunch at at Pierneef \u00e0 La Motte in Franschhoek, a top shelf restaurant, wine farm with beautiful gardens. It was just a perfect two days! Rob is knowledgeable, personable and fun. He even followed up with us by sending a list of all the sights and topics we covered with corresponding website links for further information! We highly recommend him and would certainly contact him should we visit his beloved Cape Town again."

Kevin and MarySale, ManchesterWe visited Cape Town for the first time in April this year (2013) before arriving we had made arrangements with Rob by correspondence to escort us around the Cape Peninsula which also included visiting other famous and important sites in Cape Town. He arrived at our Hotel promptly on time and suggested that we sit down together to get to know something about each other and information about the tour. This was great, not only did we leave after about 30 minutes, but we left the hotel more like old friends.His tour of the Peninsula and the beautiful Botanical Gardens in Capetown was tremendous, he is so knowledgeable, and the tour of Cable Mountain was absolutely great.We would throughly recommend this tour with Rob, and should we come again to Cape Town we would certainly love to use his services once more"

He showed us the best places at the Cape peninsula tour and managed to show us the view on the city from the above (in the cloudy weather) and the best restaurant in Africa! He really knows and loves what he does. A lot of interesting and useful information! All the help you need (we had a small problem with bank card, it was solved).

An \"in a nutshell\" description of Rob is as follows -- he is a truly warm, wonderful, stimulating and engaging person overlaid with the encyclopedia-ic situational-awareness and knowledge of Google Glass and Wikipedia, respectively!Cape Town is a fabulous city and Rob unfolds it for you in the most amazing way. It is not just about the sights themselves but the epistemology behind them as well -- this is what Rob specializes in. In short, if you are a foodie, a oenophile, loves the mountains, beaches, wildlife, nature and the ocean, then Cape Town is the city for you, and most definitely, Rob is the man!

We selected Rob on the basis of the glowing Trip Advisor reviews. Rob has truly expert knowledge on so many subjects being a former engineer, pilot, manufacturer, businessman and winemaker.He met us at Cape Grace hotel with maps of the region to explain the topography of the Cape. Together we reviewed the areas of our interests and began to prioritize what we could accomplish in the 2 days.Day 1, Rob delved into the history of Capetown with emphasis on the Dutch Colonial architecture.We then visited a fishing village and sampled the fresh local fish from a cafe on the dock. Then a delicious lunch at a wonderful local spot. A scenic drive of the cape followed. Just gorgeous! The final stop of the day was Table Mountain. Day 2 we toured the wine country. We stopped at Villieri wine farm where we enjoyed a wine tasting and a lecture on wine pairing. Lunch followed at a farm cafe in Stellenbosch where we had a chance to discuss the historical, political and social issues.Rob is passionate about Capetown and it is contagious!We parted with new found knowledge, delightful memories and even local gifts. Our only regrets were that we didn't have one more day to spend with Rob! Many thanks to Rob for his efforts and graciousness!!"

As Rob is part owner of one of the wineries there, we had truly \"red carpet\" treatment, and were surprised to find how much about viticulture AND oenology Rob knows - he's not just quoting something he read in the \"guides' handbook!\" We especially enjoyed a very hands-on, practical session of matching different wines with different foods.

He has an incredible knowledge of history, flora, fauna, geography, culture etc. But best of all he knows many local people, some of whom we had the privilege of meeting and eating with in their own houses on Rob's 'Cape Cuisine' tour. It was fascinating to learn S. Africa's history through their stories and recollections.  We were blessed with fine weather on Rob's tour of the Cape Peninsula, where we saw the penguin colony, many fine bays, beaches and wonderful scenery. Our city tour took in many sights and one amazing place that Rob knew where Archbishop Tutu made a promise, that has been 'kept' - I won't ruin the surprise for you! Our wine tour consisted of Rob taking us through many wines and matching them with various foods.

He pointed out Cape Horn is in fact not the southern most tip of Africa and the additional one and a half hour drive to get there, though pretty, would only yield a sign for us to photograph \u2013 a long way to go to take a picture. We agreed and together, with Rob\u2019s expert guidance we mapped out our fantastic day touring the Cape Peninsula.Rob\u2019s encyclopedic knowledge, gifted storytelling and incredible passion for his country made every minute entertaining, fun and engaging. With stops along this gorgeous route, he explained the topography and illustrated the unique geology of the surrounding striated mountains in a way that actually brought those peaks to life!

Rob arranges be it, do it, experience it excursions. I felt more engaged than I typically do during a show and tell type tour. 2. The excursions are built around what you want to do. Rob met with us in the morning after a few emails compiling our ideas to discuss what he thought was possible. Rob has ideas and access that you can't find online or in guide books. For example, I had said that I wanted to see animals and Rob \"happend\" to know a wine maker who also owned a small amount of hoofstock (giraffe, zebra, and antelope) and arranged for the wine maker to not only show us his wines but also his animal collection. So if you have an idea of what you want to see and do tell Rob, chances are he will know how to arrange it. 3. You will need to book early. We had originally tried to book Rob in 2012, but as the highest rated tour company in the Cape Town area he is understandably booked months in advance. We booked Sept for Jan, if you only have a limited time in Cape Town I would suggest booking as soon as possible."

The depth and variety of his knowledge is only surpassed by his genuine enthusiasm for sharing his country's history, culture and people. He took the time each day to sit down with us before-hand to plan the day's activities, customizing the experience to match our interests and schedule. I cannot think of a better way to experience the Western Cape than with Rob as a guide."

Always client-oriented, he can sense perfectly what you need and organize it for you on the spot or prepare it beforehand. Great knowledge about the region, the country and the wine industry, always pro-active and going the extra mile. He gave us many travel tips that served us a lot during the rest of our voyage.

And that is saying a lot, because we had an awesome stay! I felt instantly at ease with Rob, he just has that Midas touch which gives you confidence from the outset. He spoke to us about our tastes to personalise our trip and made sure we were happy. I loved that we had constant conversations going in the van, not just about wine but also South Africa and its history in general. Suffice to say, it really made the trip so much more worth while. We not only learnt so much about the wines (what this guy doesn't know isn't worth knowing!) but I am really happy that I walked away knowing more about the country as well. The added personal touches blew me away and I have to join all of the other 100+ Trip Advisors in saying that Rob is first rate and is worth every penny! Please don't hesitate and just get Rob booked. You won't regret it!"

From my first contact with Rob via email to saying goodbye after our fantastic tour I thoroughly enjoyed the experience personally created for us. Rob collected us from our residence even though we were staying out at Blouberg. He has a pristine luxury vehicle making you feel safe and comfortable. After a brief geography lesson of the local area Rob gets down to business to understand your expectations and tastes. He crafted a tour based on this brief conversation that met all our expectations. Having been on many wine tours in Australia, France, Germany and New Zealand I thought I knew what to expect but Rob took it to another level. The tasting experience at the first wine farm was a whole new and exciting experience blowing away preconceptions of wine types and favours. From this 1st stop the day went from strength to strength. It is not only about wine as Rob's knowledge of the area and South African history is deep. The personal touches that Rob includes makes this a truly 5-star experience. We'd take the same tour again and will definitely be insisting to others that they do the same."

Do not come and expect the usual quiet boring tour with intermittent moments of interest, Rob's passion and immense knowledge demands attention but is conveyed with such good humour that you will quickly feel less like a 'tourist' and more like someone who is visiting a good friend and having them show you around their most favourite place in the world.

He not only took us to some of the most amazing eateries but pointed out spots we should check out on our on. At each location we stopped at it was obvious that he was well known and well regarded. Made all the more impressive because like I said we created our *own* custom tour. The Wine and Chocolate Tours were amazing and I felt like every nook and cranny were available to us because we were with Rob.

Our tour included a visit to an organic vineyard where we learn about how sparkling wine is made. The education and wine tasting was great fun and we were all more than a little tipsy after.

Now, this is not a usual type sightseeing tour, but a cultural and culinary experience where you will sample the delights of the varied cuisines in the homes of the true locals. We started off on the balcony of the Town Hall to have an Africaans \"farmer style\" breakfast, then on to visit a spice store in BoKaap, followed by a Cape Malay feast at the home of Latifa. The food was a feast and each dish tempted us, one after the other! Onward to visit the home of Sandra where more delightful food was presented to us along with her tremendously warm personality. It was sad for us to enventually leave her home and venture to the township of Langa. David was waiting for us there with his traditional African style food and maize beer. As a result we developed a taste for pap and spicy chakalaka, and then requested it during our travels in southern Africa! If you are interested in the food and cultural aspects of food, then this experience will delight you. However, bear in mind that you will not need to eat that evening nor the next day!

Rob took us on the most fasinating tour ever. He made the history of the town come alive and gave us a whole new perspective on Cape Town and South Africa. Rob has lived through a lot of the recent history and gave us a very personal view of how things were and how they evolved to what they are today. We covered many of the major sites in the city, toured the marketplace, sampled wonderful bits of South African cusine along the way, then ventured up to Signal Hill where we participated in shooting off the canon at noon. After that we went to a spice market and learned about all kinds of spices and how they are used in Cape Malay foods and then surprised us by taking to a wonderful woman's home in Bo Kaap where we had the most amazing feast. She must have cooked up 20 or more dishes and breads and everything was absolutely delicious. Friom there he took us to a couple of very intimate and private wineries. The setting was stuinning. One of them was towards the top of a mountain and you had a panoramic view of the wine valley. It was like being in a millionaire's living room experiencing the best life has to offer. Then we visited a second winery that was somewhat more tradiitonal (Dutch) and the estate was beautiful. Rob had plenty of stories and experiences to share with us and made you feel right at home.The day with Rob was one of the best days of our lives and we would highly recommend a tour with Rob.

We were concerned how to tour Cape Town on our own, and choosing Rob for our guide was the best decision we could have made. He cares passionately about his city and country, and shared many insights with us, as well as answered all o our questions. We toured the Kirstenbosch gardens, and drove all over the Cape. He even took us to his favorite fish lunch at the harbor. You won't be sorry you booked a trip with Rob!"

He planned a great day for my family and I that included a mix of tastings, great food, and sweet treats, as well as a behind-the-scenes look at the wine making process. Throughout, he shared his vast knowledge on a wide range of topics - from farming sustainability, to politics, to South African history. I would highly recommend anyone visiting the Cape Town area spend a day being toured around by Rob."

What a great adventure to explore Cape Town, the coast, and the wine country with Rob Davidowitz as our personal guide and wine expert. Not only is he a delightful companion, but his knowledge of the area's history is amazing, how does he remember all that stuff??? From the Kirstenbosch Gardens to the Stellenbosch Wine Area it was great, just needed a few more days to drink it up (literally). Do not miss a visit with Rob to Overture for lunch, near Ernie Els Vineyards, just don't plan to move for the remainder of the day (too much good wine is not a good thing,after all). Just now getting around to doing our album and remembering what a memorable experience we enjoyed and wishing we could pack our bags and do it all again soon. We have recommended Rob to several friends and will continue to do so.Jim and Melle Cleghorn (Visited August 2011)"

Rob picked us up at our hotel and off we went on our eating adventure. Right from the start, our day was filled with pleasant surprises. Because of the rain, Rob managed to change our first stop from an outdoor farmer's breakfast to a breakfast on the covered balcony of city hall. We went from house to house meeting the most wonderful people and sampling all the different cultures and foods found in Cape Town. It's a lot of food but it was an experience my wife, daughter and I will never forget. The next morning we had a city tour planned and Rob again met us at our hotel and offered suggestions of things we might like to do. He was full of great ideas and, once again, we had a great morning. A day with Rob is highly recommended."

That coupled with an educational tour into wine making and tasting as well as experimenting with different flavours of food groups to enhance the palate through a meal with wine. We ate exceptionally well stopping for cheese tasting in Stellenbosch, followed by a divine lunch in another vineyard and topped of with excuitsite chocolate in Paarl.The day was filled with mirth and humor as well as some moments of reflection when we discussed more serious topics.A seriously NOT TO BE MISSED experience thanks to Rob."

            "review": "A Wonderful Adventure!. My wife and I spent 2 1/2 days with Rob starting the first day after arriving from Los Angeles the last weekend of May. I could tell from the moment we met Rob in our hotel lobby to review the day's itinerary, that we had chosen the best! Generally, we dislike tours and being shuttled around to see worthless sights that I could probably care less about. I tend to get boed easily and after a fe minutes at a site, I want to move on to the next. Rob has a keen sense to make even the most boring topics, amazingly interesting. The best thing about Rob is his love for food and wine--a passion we share as well. I don't want to give away any of Rob's trade secrets, but he took the wine tour to the next level by making you think about what you are drinking and how best to pair up the wine with food to make dining an Experience. Much more than a wine tour, Rob enlightened us with the best culinary experience and shared his passion for food and wine at every opportunity. On the last day, he took us to a farm that produces high quality chocolates to do some chocolate tasting--something I would never have thought of, but it was one of the highlights of the trip. Rob even made, what I thought would be a pretty typical boring walk through a botanical garden, a very interesting experience. Rob made us see the Cape Peninsula and Wine Country in a way we could never have seen by ourselves. There were nuances to being with Rob that made our time with him worthwhile: we visited lesser known wineries that allowed for more personal attention, he engaged us in the history of the Cape to better understand how certain vents shaped the political, social and business environment, while at the botanical garden he explained the importance of about a dozen plants and their importance in the ecosystem (in what otherwise may have just been a walk through a park, but Rob made it interactive and I really enjoyed it as opposed to questioning why I was having someone drive me to a park simply to walk me around for 5 minutes before getting bored).South Africa, and especially Cape Town, is our new favorite place in the world, largely in part to Rob's guidance and making sure he educated us on the place he so proudly calls home."

It was indeed a remarkable Cape Peninsular tour as Rob was truly passionate about his home town. He was so informative and knew everything about the place. We started off with Kirstenbosch gardens and Rob impressed us with his knowledge in Botany. He took us to Constantia Winelands and through the fishing villages and Simon\u2019s town and filled us with a lot of information about the history of the place. The tiny interesting details he threw in amazed us that he knew so much and kept even our 5 year old girl entertained. We next went to Boulder\u2019s beach to see the penguins and stopped to have a lovely lunch out there.Rob took us to the perfect scenic spots along Chapman\u2019s peak drive and could even explain the reason behind names like False Bay, Lady\u2019s mile and what was line fish all about!!! We had a fun trip to the World of Birds and then back to the hotel via Camps Bay and Clifton.His personal touch to the tour and talkative friendly nature made us feel that Rob was our family friend more than a tour guide.

We have seen so much - we learned so much about Cape Town (first day) and the region around (the other day) - and we laughed a lot - not one minute has been boring or uninteresting.Thanks for answering all the questions we had - even about cooking.My wife loves cooking and is very interested in all things around it. We both love good food, especially when we travel. So we enjoyed not only the real south african meal in the nice restaurant but Rob explained all the different tips of south african food.He also likes cooking and we got some real south african recipes. Next day he fist stopped at a shop where we could buy some spices to take home to Germany.Thank you Rob for these nice two days which gave us so much new impressions of \"your region\" - we could feel that you love your country and their people. Thanks for showing us your country with your eyes.Not to forget: The air-condition in your \"lekker\" car also has been not so bad :-)Sorry that we remembered (while looking a picture show of our trip together with friends) so late making this review.We are planning our next holidays again in Jan.2013 and you can be sure: we will contact you in time to spend another exiting 2 day together with you."

We visited Cape Town in early April for 10 days and decided to contact Rob to design two bespoke tours given that our family consisted of two adults and two children (4 and 6). Rob did exactly that in a way which was imaginative, flexible and, most importantly, receptive to the interests of both adult and child. We have never written a review in Tripadvisor until now, but felt that Rob tried so hard to make both trips special, that it was the least we could do to point others, like us, in his direction. It is his genuine enthusiasm and friendliness that makes the difference, notwithstanding his own personal touches which to repeat here would spoil what perhaps makes him unique among guides. Simply put, both days spent with Rob were the most memorable of our trip and he comes highly recommended."

On that occasion he organised a tour to the Cape, a township, Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens, and to a couple of vineyards. He proved then to be a charming and sociable person and it was apparent that he was knowledgeable and passionate about Cape Town.In January 2012, we were due to join a cruise ship at Cape Town and had a day in port before sailaway, so we contacted him to arrange another tour. This time, we wanted something different. We are interested in wildlife and wildlife photography so he was able to arrange a tour of a wild life bird sanctuary near Cape Town, and even arranged for a local 'birder' to accompany us, who also proved to be an expert in his subject and we had a wonderful few hours there. Following this we travelled over the hills to Franschoek, where we stopped for lunch in a restaurant in an exquisite setting.Overall, we were extremely pleased with our tour, for which we have lots of memories.

My expectations were very high, but what we've experienced was much better than I had imagined-we have enjoyed absolutely every minute of it. Rob has not just shown us Cape Town, he made us feel part of it for this short time that we spent there. We really felt it, smelled it and tasted it. Rob adjusted the programme on the go based on what our interests were. All of it, from personal accounts of South Africa's recent history, to current polical and social developments, to tasting fish on the pier and at a local cafe in a village where we were the only tourists, a short 'course' on surviving in the bush at the botanical gardens, to visiting a development project and great fun throughout-was absolutely great.

He is like a walking encyclopedia, I feel very lucky to have found someone to share the tour with who was so very interesting and knowledgable and with an obvious love and passion for South Africa itself.It can be intimidating spending a whole day with someone you dont know but this worry was soon blown out the window in minutes of meeting Rob. , It was the last day of our four week travels of South Africa so me and my partner were a little bit snipey with each other (as am sure couples travelling with each other will completely understand) and a little low that it was our time to go home, Rob took this in his stride and made us chuckle all the way round Cape Town.A truly exceptional person and tour operator. Would not hesitate to recommend."

We are an older couple with very specific interests, and Rob was able to tailor our time with him to hit only the aspects of Cape Town and surroundings that we were truly interested in. He was always willing to change the itinerary to fit what we wanted. He was always willing to give his advice but NEVER imposed anything on us-he always kept our priorities at heart-truly amazing guide!!! At the end of our time with him, he provided us with links to every topic we covered-not only on the places we visited but actual conversation topics we had during the drive and walks! You cannot go wrong with Rob. He is the definition of professional."

I have been fortunate to do a lot of traveling, and Rob is the best tour guide period. Besides being accommodating above and beyond what was required, he was extremely well versed in ever conceivable topic be it geology, botany, geopolitics, history, economics, agriculture, etc. I had the great fortune to spend three days with Rob, and it was by far the best money spent on the entire trip. I left with a greater appreciation of what I was seeing and experiencing-something I will never forget. I am not doing justice with how impressed I was with Rob in writing this review. I give my highest recommendation, and would recommend anyone traveling to Cape Town to spend at least one day if not longer learning from him."

One day in the wine region of Stellenbosch and Franschoek and one day at Table Mountain, Cape Point, Botanical Gardens amongst other hidden local gems.Rob being a local and wine maker was able to take us too many local places and private wineries to avoid mass numbers of tourists giving us the ability to really soak in Cape Town. Besides from learning a great deal about Cape Town you will learn a great deal about the people of South Africa amongst other things. I highly recommend Rob."

It immediately put the entire route into perspective, so much so, that as we were journeying along all I needed to do was simply soak up the vast amount of information which came pouring out of Rob (with such passion) that one dared not waste this invaluable moment.

My wife and I who hail from CT but live in Frankfurt, hosted a German couple who were visiting South Africa for the first time and decided to use Beautiful Cape Town Priovate Tours (Rob Davidowitz) in providing them a private 2-day Cape Town and surroundings experience.We were very impressed with the varied but detailed program that he devised for us (based on our interests) which included: DAY ONE - a private and detailed guided tour of a functioning wine estate (including a special wine-tasting) in Stellenbosch, visits to Franschoek and a wonderful local restaurant for lunch, additional wine tastings at a few selected award-winning boutique wineries etc and then a beautiful scenic drive back to our Cape Town Waterfornt hotel. Rob, being a wine-maker hmself has intimate knowledge of the process involved in producing top wines (including 'methode champenoise') and has close relationships with many of the wine producers in the region. DAY TWO - we headed out on a tour of the Cape Penninsula which included visits to Kirstenbosch Botannical Gardens (and an extremely instructive lesson on the indigenous flora of the Cape), Kalk Bay harbour (where we interacted with the local fishermen and sampled 'smoked snoek'), the Penguin sanctuary at Simonstown, Noordhoek village where we had lunch in another excellent restaurant, Hout Bay and Chapman's Peak, Llandudno, Clifton, Camps Bay and finshed with a cable-car ride to the top of Table Mountain!.Rob has incredible knowledge of the Fauna and Flora of the area, the best places to eat and visit and devised a program that provided a unique experience to our friends and showcased the best that Cape Town has to offer - all in 2 full days!His sense of humour and his impromptu anecdotes about the different places we were visiting made the whole experience very enjoyable and relaxing. We never felt pressured to finish the photo-taking or hurry along if we lingered at a particular point of interest, and his attention to detail and attentive attitude towards his 4 guests was admirable, considering the number of times he must have been asked the same thing!A truly memorable experience and we felt proud as Capetonians to show our German friends the Cape in such style and professionalim, thanks to Rob Davidowitz!"

The first day we did the wine country and found him to be a very knowledgeable guide and very informed about wines and also about food and restaurants. The second day we did the penninsula down to the Cape of Good Hope another fantastic day, he proved to be an excellant geologist and historian about this area. The third day was Table Mountain and the City of Cape Town, again we had a fantastic time. Rob is an extremely interesting and well versed person, we would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone."

The way your vacation begins can influence your entire trip, and having Rob Davidowitz show you the sites around Cape Town for 2 days and impart his vast knowledge about EVERYTHING with you is definitley the way to begin. He was so entertaining and friendly that it was hard to believe we had just met him. He was extremely accomodating when we decided to change some things last minute, really making it \"OUR\" trip. Once we returned home, he followed up with an email, giving us information regarding all the things we had talked about and wanted to learn about. I would highly recommend Rob as a Cape Town guide, and would love to go back and have him show us more of that beautiful area!"

He picked us up at the hotel and asked us what we wanted to do, and we were able to completely customize our day. First stop was to Table Mountain, where the crowds were already gathered to take the gondola to the top. Rob suggested we skip this and head straight to wine country, as we'd end up spending half our day waiting in line. In a very short while, we arrived at Villiera where he is a partner, for a tour of the wine making facilities and a tasting of their diverse range of wines. Then we stopped at Terrior for a wonderful lunch in a very relaxing environment. Afterwards, it was off to the Golden Triagle for a tastingat Rust en Vrede, and finally a stop at Annondale. Overall, it was a fantastic day, and Rob was a very knowledgable, engaging and entertaining host. This is not your run of the mill tour, it's truly a personal experience."

On Friday 28th October I had the privilege of joining the Uthando Tour for a guided visit to several community upliftment projects around the Cape Town environs. Overall, James Fearney's knowledge of the recent sociopolitical history of South Africa and its impact on diverse communities was thorough and detailed, with a strong ethos of the constructive approach developed by the Mandela administration to uniting a divided country and facing fearlessly the injustices of the past, whilst treating with compassion those in need of help in the implementation of democracy. The projects that we visited showed that this continues to be achieved in many encouraging and endearing ways for ordinary people: at a school in Retreat we were delighted by an Opera outreach project with school children playing along in a production of Hansel and Gretel; in Khayelitsha we joined a local men's choir and dance group in favourite South African sing alongs and saw all the good work being done by this community centre in health, crafts and rooftop garden; around the corner we visited a pretty community garden growing vegetables to feed locals and to sell to market; and in Macassar we drummed along with a group of potters making hand-crafted ceramics to uplift the youth of the area. Truly, the people we met were so warm-hearted and friendly, the initiatives so well thought out and useful, that it took me back to those most inspiring years when Mandela was in the Presidency, and South Africa wowed the world. Thank you Uthando for sharing the love and creativity of our wonderful people!"

Although we enjoyed every part of the holiday, our visit on the Uthando township tour will remain in our memory for the rest of our lives. This tour was recommended by our U.K. Travel company. Holiday Architects in Cheltenham, how pleased that they made this recommendation. James and Xolani our guides,picked us up from our apartment at 8:30am for a half day tour. James talked to our party of eight while driving to the townships, what an interesting talk, giving us the history of Uthando a not for profit charity. Xolani then talked about his life and where he was brought up as a child, again, very interesting.We visited four projects, firstly we visited a nursery school, then onto a craft workshop followed by a garden project for after school activities. Our last stop was a dance studio for a full rehearsal for a show. Our travel agent had passed on that it was my wife's birthday. The beautiful children sang happy birthday to her. James also gave her a book about Conversation with the Elders, sponsored by Uthando. If you are in Cape Town, make sure you book this tour. Everyone benefits"

It was so moving and powerful to see that the systematic efforts to totally destroy the humanity of the black South African people had failed. In fact not only could their spirit not be crushed, but in some bizarre ironic way their spirit can serve as an example to the world of how to heal and move forward from atrocities that a nation and a people have suffered as victim, perpetrator and bystander. Thank you James for supporting these projects and providing glimpses for the world to see of what can be for these post-apartheid children. It is a much needed perspective given the abundance of news that focuses only on the corruption, unemployment, violence and other problems in South Africa."

Uthando raises money and awareness for the many projects they fund through these tours. You are driven through very poor areas in the townships directly to these programs. We visited a senior center, a gardening project, dance school and after school programs. We only saw a few of the many programs that Uthando sponsors.

Not knowing exactly what to expected, this tour exceeded all of our expectations ( 2 adults and 18 and 16 yr old). we visited a garden project, a women group, a kindergarten and a day centre for Sr citizens- all interesting in their own way. We really got a sense of the struggles that the community faced during apartheid. the challenges that they are facing now and the immense scope of what needs to be achieved in the future. I cannot recommend this 'tour' enough. Many thanks Xolani!!"

This was the best 'tour' I have ever experienced in South Africa, not only did I learn a great deal of the history of SA thanks to our passionate and highly motivated guide Xolani, but this tour opened my eyes to the struggle but also the growth and efforts people are going to, to develop and educate those who in the past did not have these opportunities. This is not a township tour, but rather a heartfelt cultural exploration that gives you an insight into the history of South Africa and the lives people encounter in the townships. Uthando sponsor a large number of projects and underprivileged people, this tour allows you to experience the help Uthando offer as well as see the people empowered in a sustainable way. This half day trip included visits to a community vegetable garden, a day care orphanage and an entrepreneurship & education project. For me the highlight of the day was visiting the senior\u2019s project, meeting and communicating with the 'oldies' and seeing the hope that this project instills in these elders, with a wealth of history and wisdom. Uthando allows you as the 'tourist' to experience and understand the history and the struggle people of the townships have lived and portray in a heartfelt and passionate way can be done to change this."

Uthando tours offers a very unusual experience, an encounter with a world and people the usual tourist would probably never meet.Obviously the idea of a township tour is a bit ambivalent, however I think through visiting the projects and the work people are performing it moves from a visit to a zoo, to a meeting between people. I hope the people in the projects perceived it the same way.During our half-day tour we visited four projects, a kindergarten/pre-school, a community gardening project, a women handicraft project and a day-meeting facility for the elderly.We were welcomed everywhere with open arms and open hearts.Meeting with the elderly people was the most intense experience. To start with, I felt very uncomfortable, as we the vistors were put on a kind of panel. Only later did I understand that this was necessary, as without translation support, we couldn't have communicated. Visiting the projects and driving through the area I definately saw a site of Cape Town I wouldn't have had access to. I hope the people we visited also felt comfortable with our presence."

It felt very voyeuristic to go and see these areas, but after reading others' reviews on Trip Advisor, I decided to book with Uthando. I am so glad that I did. First, the guide, Xolani, was an amazing ambassador for Cape Town and SA. He is extremely knowledgeable about Cape Town and South African politics, history, and current events. The entire trip I felt like a sponge, sucking up all the information he provided to us. He was so friendly and easy going, you felt right at home. We made three stops. Ekhaya eKhasi Art and Education Centre, Masibathande Seniors Project, and Abalimi Bezekhaya (community garden). All were run by inspiring, friendly people, who were pleased to see us and welcomed us warmly. Each provided us with insight into the day to day lives of the people living and working in the townships. At the seniors project, we danced with each of the \"oldies\" (as Xolani called them), which was so special and a touching moment I won't forget. It was a welcome that would melt anyone's heart.I would like to stress that at none of the places did we once feel pressured to donate or purchase anything. Each place (and Xolani) stressed that just through our tour, we had contributed towards their community and they were grateful for that alone. At the conclusion of the tour, a follow up email is sent if you would like to donate after the tour. Thank you Uthando for opening your communities to the outside world and creating understanding and development through personal contact. Please keep up the amazing work."

We wanted to expose our families, who are from the USA, to inspirational stories, terrific programs, and the amazing people who are thriving in these communities that once served as virtual prisons in the apartheid era. Xolani lives in one of the townships and seemed to be widely known--certainly at the four programs we visited. He introduced us to several program leaders who are bringing much social and economic change to the townships. This is not a gawking tour, rather your guide safely and kindly escorts visitors to programs in the townships that Uthando supports. Special opportunity.

Went on two tours with Uthando of the massive city of Khayelitsha; one with a wide group of business associates and their partners, and then again with my family. Uthando (which means Love) is helping to support projects in the townships, endeavouring to rebuild South Africa from the bottom up. In places that are, to Western eyes, desperately poor and without hope, Uthando is helping sow seeds of hope and optimism that there is a better future for this great nation. Over our two visits we looked at four different projects: a vegetable garden project where kids are learning about creating gardens and both eating and selling the product; a school where there is a real focus on building better citizens who make better choices; a craft centre where there are a diverse set of people making all sorts of crafts for sale both in South Africa and internationally; and the Amy Biehl Foundation which operates an after school and holiday program featuring music, drama, poetry, dance and so was keeping kids in a safe learning environment while their parents are trying to earn an income. (Incidentally to learn how significant the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was to securing a peaceful transition to democracy in South Africa, look up Amy Biehl's story on the web; it takes forgiveness to break the cycle of revenge and mistrust). All of these projects were full of lovely people in an unlovely situation - but they were inspirational as they work to turn their lives around. If you visit South Africa to visit just the game parks or see the sights, you have missed the best part. If you just think the townships in South Africa are simply locations for crime and corruption, you have missed the point. This tour demonstrates the triumph of the human spirit overcoming some terrible circumstances.This is an amazing tour to do and it will change you view of life and South Africa."

Cape Town is a city of luxury, nature, and adventure for your average tourist; it is so easy to get caught up in all of that and forget that there's another side to South Africa. Visiting the townships is something every traveler should do--it will humble you and inspire you. It will fill you with knowledge. It will remind you to give back to your communities and to love and respect your fellow humans and other cultures. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and kind. He explained so much of the current politics to us and, even though I have read extensively on the history of South Africa, particularly during apartheid, I still learned so much from him and from the three groups we visited. In fact, I only wish I could have spent more time in the townships. If you are privileged enough to travel, you should definitely make it a priority to do a tour such as this that gives back in some way and enriches your knowledge and cultural understanding. Each group had a lovely array of crafts for sale as well, and the money went to support some pretty inspiring organizations who are really doing wonderful work with limited resources. I will never ever forget my experience in the townships."

I will venture to say that you will not understand the history and culture of South Africa and Cape Town without taking a tour like this. There are other Township tours you can take; Uthando has a vested interest in over 40 (I think it's 40) different projects across a few townships.

Xolani was an informed and passionate guide into the lives of millions of Africans in SA.I admit that my partner and I had some trepidation before going on the tour. We want to know the real stories of our travel destinations, yet seeing the townships from the air coming into Cape Town was overwhelming and fearful. We're so happy we went forward with this \"tour\". The quotation marks are an acknowledgement that this is so much more than a tour. Our visit to a few of the projects Uthando is supporting helped us to understand the depth of the issues surrounding poor blacks in SA, and their grassroots efforts to help themselves when there appears to be little political will to provide services for them.Take this tour. Spend time learning the truth from people who will inspire you and warm your hearts."

Uthando means love in South African and it is a non-profit organization that supports projects throughout Cape Town and its townships. It is not a typical tourist attraction but one that really connects tourists with real people, real concerns, and real hardships and solutions. There are many projects that can be visited. We saw a women's center that helped teach women gardening, cooking, beadwork, provided after school activities for children, and gave women and children a place to go to feel useful and needed. We also went to a community garden that had grown to the point the women there were providing fresh food to local restaurants. And we went to a senior center where the \"Oldies\" could spend time away from their cares and concerns and be taken care of themselves. Our guide was Xolani and he did a phenomenal job of explaining -- and sharing -- Uthando with us. We learned a lot about him and a great deal about Apartheid as seen throught the eyes of someone who experienced it firsthand -- very moving stories. As someone else said - this is a must do experience in Cape Town -- you won't be disappointed and you will definitely learn a lot."

This time we visited the country with our two teenage daughters and I felt that it was important for us to see what life is like in the townships and so I looked into different tours. Uthando stood out for me as I liked the fact that it is a NGO working with projects in the townships. We had a great guide- thank you Xolani, and learnt a lot about life in the townships. We visited a craft project for women (and bought some crafts there- we now wish we had bought more!), an amazing organic garden and a project for older people. We were greeted with warmth and were inspired by the work of all the projects. The tour had a lasting impression on us and I am now trying to think of ways in which I can continue to support the work which Uthando does.

Excellent tour guide. Not only did he show us a number of different projects Uthando is involved in, he also gave us some historical perspective regarding the issues of Cape Town/South Africa. He left me wanting to learn more. And, he really loves his job! I also love that Uthando has a 'pack for a cause' project with a wish list so visitors can help out with items that the children and others may need. I only wish I had brought items with me!

A highlight as always was the 'Kindergarten for Oldies', the singing, smiles and warm hugs from people who have lived in Cape Town their whole lives and due to the apartheid regime many of them have never been up Table Mountain, visited the V&A, taken the ferry to Robben Island, been on any of the cities' beaches or into any of Cape Town's glamorous establishments.

We recently made a half day tour of the Townships near Cape Town, South Africa with James Fernie, founder and Director of a charitable organization called Uthando (South Africa) Social Development Projects. Uthando is the Xhosa and Zulu word for \"love,\" and this was evident in the way James was greeted in each of the projects he took us to visit. First was a women's craft project in which women were taught beading and other crafts. On the roof there was a garden; the women were very proud to show us around. Next was an agricultural project in which a number of ladies developed a farm on which they grow vegetables to be sold to restaurants in Cape Town. Their hard work was a terrific demonstration of the power of determined women! We then visited a preschool which doubles as a chorus school for young people in the afternoons. It was heartwarming to see how happy the children were, and how modern principles of education were followed in a rather difficult setting. We ended up at a dance school (\"Dance for Everyone\") which reaches out to the townships to teach young boys and girls various forms of dance. When particularly talented individuals are identified they are invited to a live-in intermediate program where the finer points of dance are learned, and many have gone off to careers in dance around the world. What an inspiration that day was for us. Uthando funds these and other projects aimed at developing self-help among the people living in the townships. This visit as really the highlight of our two week trip to South Africa, and we would recommend it to anyone who has the opportunity."

The Kiddies Educare was an uplifting visit. The director is an amazing and compassionate lady who started the program which now educates pre-school, kindergarten and first graders. The rooms full of smiling, learning youngsters were wonderful to see. Uthando partners with Kiddies Educare and helped them build the school building they now occupy. We also visited a women's center where the ladies develop skills that further their livelihoods. Our last stop with a Sr. Center. The ladies and gentlemen welcomed us with smiles and warm hearts. They wanted to learn about our lives and shared theirs with us. We got to sing and dance together and it felt like we were, for a brief while, a part of their community.

I had a chance to visit a senior day centre where they really welcomed me. However, the most moving part of my tour, was seeing how Zoliswa the leader of the Educare day care centre, managed the staff and uncomplaining coped with up to 70 preschoolers. She has sacrificed and given into her community. It challenged me and gave me an opportunity to go back a couple of days later and help in a very practical way.It makes you want to cheer the good being done and makes you want to help fix what needs fixing.

The group consisted of the five of us and a group of five German tourists. During the trip to Kaylisha Township, James provided some history on apartheid and the townships. It made an impression on all of us. It is very sobering to see tens of thousands of people living in corrugated housing without the electricity and plumbing we take for granted. We were gratified to see some of the newer communities that are being built to replace the township housing, but there is still a long way to go. Thankfully there are organizations like Uthando that are making a difference. Once at Kaylisha, we were introduced to the group leaders for each of the programs. We visited the culinary training, woodworking training, sewing classes, the organic gardens and an after school program. The group leaders explained that each student is required to pay a nominal amount so that they have something invested in the training program. The students are also provided with basic business training, and some students have started baking or sewing businesses. The organic gardens provide fresh vegetables for people in the township and a portion of the produce is also sold outside of the township. The after school program was our favorite. The children entertained us with singing and dancing. It was both an eye-opening and an uplifting experience and we recommend it to anyone visiting Cape Town."

He gave an excellent overview of the history of apartheid and how the townships came to be, as well as conveying his enthusiasm for his work and his admiration of the human spirit of the residents he works with. Highly recommended if you go to Cape Town."

Thanks to the stellar recommendations from Trip Advisor, we booked a half day field trip with Uthando for our family vacation to South Africa. We couldn't have got it more right! James was a great host, but really let the people we met at the projects take the spotlight. He was right on time to pick us up from our hotel and provided just the right amount of detail and history to give us the proper background. A complete professional and at no time did we worry about our safety. James' passion for the people in the informal settlements is infectious! We visited three projects. Our favorite was the organic garden and Mama Nokwanda. She told her story on the porch of the thatch-roofed building on a beautiful sky blue morning while sharing tea with us then gave us a tour of the garden itself. The day we were there some grad students were installing a biodigestor! We would recommend booking the tour for the afternoon so that you can see more of the incredible work being done in after school programs for students. The whole morning was at the same time eye opening and inspirational! We are so glad we now have faces and names to remember and think about from our visit to Cape Town and South Africa."

James Fernie did a fabulous job of the describing the history, culture and current state of affairs in the townships. The kids commented that they had learned far more about Africa and the effects of aparteid on this trip than they would have in a year a school. It was quite eye opening for all of us to see the conditions that people face in the townships, but highly inspirational to see the spirit of the people and understand the many projects underway to improve living conditions. James and Uthando deserve a lot of credit and as much support as we can provide."

James Fernie takes you to meet the people first hand in the townships. I was so touched and inspired by the work being done at the schools! The children were so wonderful and warm. On the tour James answered all of our questions about the history of the country, the people, and where we were going. Our tour included five journalism students so there were lots of questions and James answered them all. It also made sense. We did a lot of tours in one week and oftentimes I get bored or don't follow the details, but James made it easy to understand and was so helpful in understanding more about the country. I just wanted to mention a part about safety. I felt incredible safe! Everyone greeted us so warmly. You don't want to just roam into the townships by yourself, a tour is the best route and this tour gave me such an eye opening experience. My boyfriend is coming to visit me end of the summer and I'm going to take him! I highly recommend it! -Tallie J"

If you are coming to South Africa, you have to see THIS part of it. The people we met at the various organizations within the townships are simply the most beautiful people I have and will probably ever meet in my life. What amazed me most was that despite living in place of extreme poverty and despair, these people are so positive. It definitely puts things in perspective if, like me, you are from a 1st world country(U.S.).James was a great guide and because he has lived the history, he was very knowledgeable about the area and the people. This is definitely a must-do if you come to Cape Town, and if you are like me you will definitely want to come back."

My parents were recently visiting from the U.S. and kept asking me if they could get out to see the Townships. They felt that it wouldn't be right for them to come all the way to South Africa and not be exposed to how the majority of people live here. That made total sense to me, but I was worried that the township tours would reinforce a voyeuristic dynamic between tourists and township residents that I was very uncomfortable with. So I was relieved and excited to discover that Uthando tours were created to respond to my exact concerns. At first, I was taken aback by the cost, but when I learned that it is a certified fair-trade tour and 1/2 of the cost goes to help fund the projects we would see, I decided that it would be worth the extra cost. There was so much that I appreciated about the experience.The tour was hosted in a way that was extremely respectful of the communities we visited. James, our guide, was very conscious of not creating a tourist spectacle as we moved through the communities. And when we arrived to the different projects, he handed the tour over to the members of the projects to talk about what they were doing in their own words and from their own experience.I also appreciated how the tour was centred on the good that's happening in the Townships. It illuminated the unsung heros- the powerful grassroots community initiatives that are addressing the legacy of apartheid with relentless creativity, energy and love. It certainly exposed the challenges as well, but through the lens of possibility. And I enjoyed how down-to-earth, personal, and open James was with us. He shared his knowledge of the history of apartheid and the legacy it has left behind, but also his own perspective and personal experience of having lived through it as a young boy and young adult. The only thing about the experience that I felt was lacking was that the projects we visited didn't have any activities going on at the time. So we spoke to the staff (often the founders) and learned about the amazing work they were doing, but weren't able to see it in action. I realize it's hard to time tours just right so that you arrive at a time of more community involvement, but I think that would have made the experience come to live in a much richer way."

In all case, we saw dedicated and energetic leadership and young people obviously enjoying what they were doing.I could not recommend this more, as it was recommended to me and my family.

I took this tour in December, collected from where I was staying and guided by Charlene and joined by two American travellers. We visited some of the projects supported by Uthando. The majority of what you pay for the tour goes directly to the projects you have visited. I guess the projects visited depends on the day.Charlene was an excellent tour leader. She provided a lot of information on the history of the region and of the culture of the Xhosa people. She was able to answer any question aimed at her and the rapport she has with the township dwellers was very evident. I have described the 4 projects we visited below. I can only echo what the other reviewers have said - it was truly wonderful to meet the people of the townships and to see what they are achieving for themselves with help and support from Uthando. Even a month later, I can still clearly remember the smiles, friendliness, optimism, passion we encountered that day. I will definitely take this tour again when I am next in Cape Town.Project 1 Happy Feet (Langa Township) - a local guy is teaching young kids gum-boot dancing in an after-school setting. The leader spoke passionately about his work and the kids performed with such enthusiasm and a real sense of fun. Uthando funded the building where the Happy Feet dance troupe rehearse. Project 2 Volcano Arts Project (Gugulethu Township) \u2013 Mandlesizwe, a local guy runs a performance group putting on educational plays for the local community and schools. We spoke to Maldlesizwe about previous productions and plans for the future. Uthando had built a large stage and performance are beside his house. Project 3 Thokozani Brothers (Khayelitsha Township) - a choir for teenagers run by older locals, who themselves peform in a senior choir which has travelled overseas. The director explained that the senior choir provides role models for the teenagers and the choir gives them a chance to experience life outside the township through performing.Project 4 Abalimi Bezekaya ((Khayelitsha Township) \u2013 local people are growing vegetables and herbs and passing these skills onto other members of the local community. The ladies working on this project provided us with tea and freshly-baked cakes!!"

It was amazing and uplifting to see all the energy and optimism among the people involved in the projects. And it felt good knowing that a significant share of what we paid for the tour actually goes into the projects Uthando is supporting.

We can learn a lot from the citizens of the townships, whose capacity to go on with life despite all the hardships they have to face daily, to smile and be friendly and generous and who just never seem to give up hope is absolutely remarkable. I hope that after having had the opportunity to visit the projects, we will become more generous and compassionate ourselves and learn that give not just take is important in life.

What's happening is the growth of non-profit organizations seeded and managed by hard working, visionary residents of these communities. The organizations vary from child day care and orphanage to senior centers to community gardens, youth empowerment and performing art groups, human rights groups and other examples of people improving their lives and making a difference by pushing forward and standing up for themselves and their neighbors. In a touring group large or small you can see, learn about and in some cases meet people doing phenomenal things in the aftermath of a long period of adverse circumstances. James Fernie and his Uthando SA staff have spent a lot of time getting to know and supporting the work of people and organizations in the Cape Flats neighborhoods. They have an excellent understanding of the complexities of Cape Town, how things work in the townships, and how the townships fit into the fabric of the greater city.

We were very keen that our children (son (14) and daughter (12)) should come away from our trip with some understanding of the history of South Africa and some idea of its ongoing challenges as well as having enjoyed all the wonderful hospitality and incredible experiences it has to offer. Both children had been very bothered by the shacks on either side of the N2 as we drove into Cape Town from the airport and had asked us all sorts of questions that we really weren't equipped to answer. Charlene was a wonderful guide, teacher and host as she took us round the townships of Guguletu and Khayalitsha and she helped us all to better understand what we were seeing. We met some truly incredible people at the youth theatre, day care and gardening projects that we visited. Our visits felt reassuringly unintrusive and the welcome we received at all of them made us feel privileged to be there. Our day with Uthando was an incredibly positive experience, emotional and hugely enjoyable. We feel very fortunate to have met people like Margaret and Volcano whose commitment to their communities is awe inspiring to say the least. We wish Uthando and all of their projects the success that they deserve."

Unlike other township tours Uthando offers the chance to visit amazing organisations within the townships and give something back to the community. My tourguide (Charlene) was extremely knowledgable and friendly and when back in SA I will definately be returning to Uthando. This is a must for anyone wanting to get more out of an organised tour than usual. Truelly inspirational!!"

You don't just drive around a township and see the official tourist sites, but rather you visit local projects that Uthando supports. We visited two projects, one called 'Happy Feet' which is about teaching young kids gumboot dancing as a way of occupying the after school hours, and a vegetable growing project. It was just amazing to see the initiative and dedication of those involved, also that these are things that have grown up through the community, rather than being imposed from top down. It's also a very good way of seeing township life and experiencing its vibrancy, and the fact that despite their material poverty in a land of wealth, there is an amazing sense of community and care for one another. I got taken round by Charlene, who is very knowledgeable about South Africa's current situation."

We visited a senior day care center, a pet hospital, a center for abused women and children and a community garden project. Along the way we learned about the history of apartheid in South Africa and the ways in which the township residents are working to create a better life for themselves as well as the ways visitors can assist.

We will definitely return-feel like we barely scratched the surface. And every day had at least one peak experience, sometimes several. Every day we met and enjoyed the company of the nicest, most welcoming people imaginable. So this is the context for what I am about to say about James Fernie, the Executive Director and moving force behind Uthando, and his amazing non-profit. Uthando gave us a unique opportunity to get a close-up view of life in a Cape township and to meet people who are truly helping to build South Africa and make the lives of all South Africans better. It is a unique business model. We hire Uthando to provide us with access to leaders in the community development field, Uthando passes back payments to support the community development projects with whom it maintains relationships. Uthando ensures that one gets to meet people who share their insights and stories about their work. In our case, we visited four sites: a pre-school, a jobs and skills development center, a program that promotes community organic gardening and a literacy program that employs sports (football) to lure youth to a constructive learning environment. In each case, we had the opportunity for in-depth conversations about the work being done. James is a very knowledgable guide. He has lived the history and been involved in creating change. We wanted to have a closeup experience of township life without being dispassionate gawkers. The Uthando Private Tours program provides this opportunity. We left feeling that we had made a small but meaningful financial contribution to the projects that we visited - in exchange we met some truly extraordinary people and left hopeful for the future of this great and beautiful country and for our world. We gained a deeper understanding of township life and of the history, strength and beauty of this community. The day we spend with James on tour was truly transformative. If you do one thing when you go to Cape Town, book a tour with Uthando Private Tours!"

Of all the things we saw and did in South Africa when we are telling friends about our visit it is Uthando that we start with and talk about the most. It was an amazing visit. We met the ladies who grow vegetables to sell to restaurants in Cape Town, the old folk who meet for lunch and travel down memory lane and the young people in a theatre group who trying to make a difference to other young people in schools through messages conveyed through music and drama. We felt so honoured to meet these people and see the difference Uthando is making to their lives. When the old folk sang to us they made a difference to our lives and gave us a lasting memory. We only know a little of the struggles they have endured in their lives but they so appreciated the time we spent with them. It is when we reflect afterwards that we fully realise what a wonderful part of our tour this visit to the township with Uthando was. Thankyou to everyone."

At High Noon we all smiled to the heavens as a plane flew over to snap our photo. I then got taken to his own hood where a street fair was in progress. We ended our day by attending first a local dance performance by a few groups, then a professional dance recital in a theatre. I laughed, I cried, I unashamedly sung Shakira's 'Waka Waka' song at the top of my lungs.

We were curious to learn about and visit the townships, but reluctant to do so, not wanting to be intrusive -but also not wanting to just stare at strangers from a bus window. The concierge at the Welgelegen Guest House (also great) put us on to Uthando South Africa, which was described as a non-profit, fair trade tourism outfit. We attended one of their events, met the leader, James, other members of Uthando and different groups from various townships. It was a marvelous experience and really was non-exploitative.Uthando is trying to help build a new South Africa, and all the cliche's about townships are turned on their head. You meet creative, energetic people, and you realize that there is more that connects us than separates us. At that event in Cape Town, they showcased the performing talents of -I don't know how many groups of all ages- who performed everything from regional/tribal songs and dance, to modern dance, to rap and hip hop. They also presented various small groups who were involved in creating businesses, selling crafts, helping youth at risk, promoting multi-racial & ethnic harmony etc., all of whom you could talk with, question and get to know. Our friends then went to visit the townships with them on another day, but we missed out because I got sick.Even without a visit to their homes, the experience was incredibly inspiring and introduced my wife and I to elements of South Africa that we would have spent weeks tracking down by ourselves, if ever.Educational, entertaining, helping build a better world. Sounds too good to be true, but it wasn't. I hope this conveys how enthusiastic we are about being allowed more deeply into the culture of South Africa, beyond the standard game park experience."

Not in a fact after fact way but in a way that makes you intimately acquainted with this beautiful land. After spending two days with her it was hard to say goodbye. But Zambia was calling!

Tania was just that--pleasant, funny, relaxed, and most importantly--informative! We did the Wine Tour with her and the Cape Peninsula tour, (she also picked us up from the airport), and both were unbelievable. She brought us to all of the noted stops on the latter, however she had no problem stopping here and there to take photos of us along the way. She was very flexible to our interests and desires, and after a few hours together, it really felt like we were old friends. We couldn't wait to be reunited for the Wine Tour, which also proved to be beautiful and full of surprises (free tastings, truffles, etc. because it was our honeymoon). Tania also recommended many restaurants and helped us organize the rest of our days and our trip to Table Mountain. If you are looking for a personal, individualized approach, Tania and Yaseen are the easy choice.Note: Although I was excited to meet Yaseen after the wonderful things I had heard about him as well, he was booked on other tours during our stay.

We saw so much incredible scenery and wildlife and were so impressed by how much Yaseen knew about seemingly everything.The second tour we took was the Cape Winelands tour with Tania. This tour was completely different than the Cape Peninsula tour, and we\u2019re so glad we decided to do both. Our expectations were completely exceeded: Tania could not have been nicer, and we absolutely loved everywhere that she took us. In addition to visiting several wine estates, Tania also took us to an olive oil tasting, a beer tasting, and a chocolate tasting. We stopped for lunch in Franschhoek, and at the restaurant that Tania recommended we had what turned out to be our favorite meal of the entire trip.

What if it were a family of siblings, family with no children or alternative family structures? Rant aside with TripAdvisor, we had a wonderful with Yaseen from Discovery Tours. He took us on 3 full day tours of the city, the cape peninsular and the winelands. Usually, my gripe with private tours is that the guide don't provide enough information. Not in yaseen's case. He is obviously an intelligent and well-read individual who takes pride in his work. Ask him anything and chances are that he will be able to answer fully and then some.Aside from being very knowledgeable, he was also very personable and friendly, making effort to engage everyone in the group. Even for the most unsocial yours truly. He will try and try again until you crack. :) Together with a great sense of humor, he made our time spent in and around Cape Town memorable and fuss-free. He took care of us very well indeed.Another thing to note, Yaseen is the business owner of Discovery Tours together with his wife Tania. So you cannot get a better person more motivated and interested that you have a fulfilling tour with them. Speaking as a business owner myself, I understand his motivation and drive. He will do his best for you, so you really can't go wrong with him."

During our tour we mentioned that we were interested in going out to the wine country on our last day in Cape Town. Tania mentioned a cheetah sanctuary that she thought our daughters would enjoy and said that Yaseen could probably give us the tour the next day.The next day we were picked by Yaseen who instantly made our girsl feel at ease with his stories about South African culture and quizzes he gave them to test their knowledge. Yaseen is also a wealth of knowledge about Cape Town. We had a wonderful time with Yaseen at the Graff Winery and the Cheetah sanctuary. He also took us to a bird sanctuary where both my daughters were able to hold and eagle on their arm. Very memorable experience. I would recommend Discovery Tours without hesitation and you should just go ahead and make your reservation with them. You will not regret it!"

One day around the Cape with Yassine with history, animals and marvelous scenery, the second day Table Mountain, a look at the town, the Botanical Gardens and a taste of wine country with Tania. The fact they both shared personal stories of living and working during a lot of the recent history of the area, added an extra dimension to our stay. They were called last minute, adapted to our vague plans beautifully, added personal touches such as dropping our shopping bags at the B&B after dropping us off at the Waterfront. We felt we had friends showing us their home town!"

I was in Cape Town in December 2015, when my son and I enjoyed a fabulous Winelands tour with Tania, which involved beautiful views, wine tasting at excellent vineyards, time to explore Franschhoek and Stellenbosch, lunch at a restaurant where the view, the cuisine, and the ambiance were exceptional, all in the delightful company of Tania, who gave us fascinating commentary about the winelands, as well as insights into the politics of South Africa. In January, 2016, both of my sons and I embarked on a fascinating exploration of the coastline and Cape Peninsula with Yasin, who was a font of information about the flora and fauna of the peninsula, from baboons to penguins, and who deftly navigated our to countless beautiful views. Both Yasin and Tania are incredibly congenial, knowledgeable guides, and we felt very fortunate to be able to spend our very special days in Cape Town with them on two different occasions. They are ideal guides, and we can\u2019t recommend them highly enough."

And they can tell exciting stories about places visited, especially Mark with his log-term background of Cape Town National Park ranger and professor-like knowledge of virtually every plant or bird that you can see there. The wine tasting trip took us to several beautiful and quiet estates like Anthonij Rupert or Boschendal. Great time, great experience, strongly recommended company."

Yaseen planned a stopover to the natural stone museum which the kids loved! They spent 30 minutes collecting precious stones and gems and were very well entertained.The sights are spectacular and highly recommend the trip. There are cheaper options to drive around the Cape but its worth paying a little more to go with Discovery Tours. The trip felt very personal and Yaseen made every effort to make our trip special. Ps. We forgot our phone in the car and he very kindly came the next day to our hotel to return it. Thanks again!"

With only 2 short days to explore Cape Town - we made possibly the best (and luckiest!) decision of our travel lives in booking the services of Discovery Tours. From the moment Yaseen picked us up at the airport, it felt like visiting a friend we didn't know we had. Deeply knowledgable, highly personable, and sincerely caring, Yaseen ensured we experienced the Cape Peninsula to the fullest, sharing with us incredible landscapes where we were totally alone in nature - a far cry from some of the areas packed with tour vehicles we saw elsewhere. It felt like truly discovering the Cape Peninsula, not simply \"touring\". As well as his expert knowledge of flora, fauna and geography, Yaseen also provided deep insight into the history of South Africa, having personally experienced its most turbulent periods. This perspective gave essential context to all that we saw - invaluable when trying to grasp a place as stunning, complicated and singular as South Africa. We're already planning a return trip, and Yaseen and Tania will be our first stop for advice, expertise & guidance. It's no exaggeration to say that Discovery Tours *Made* our trip to Cape Town. We arrived as strangers, and left feeling we had friends in South Africa. We can't recommend Discovery Tours highly enough.-Brion & Miriam, Portland, Oregon, USA"

On our second day we went out on a day tour with Yaseen, and had a wonderful day. We were a family group of 5 adults from the UK, and none of us had visited South Africa before. One of the group is a keen birdwatcher, and we therefore asked during the booking process if we could slightly amend the route of the Cape Peninsula tour. Yaseen and Tania were more than happy to do this for us, and we therefore did the route in reverse, and ended with a visit to Kirsten bosch Gardens.The booking process was extremly easy and all queries were answered fully and promptly. Payment was made by cash on the day of the tour. Both Yaseen and Tania are interested in wildlife and love their city and are happy to share this knowledge and enthusiasm.Yaseen arrived on time, and already knew all our names. He was an excellent guide for the day, chatty and funny. He showed us some beautiful places, found us lots of birds and animals and was flexible in his approach.We would all be very happy to recommend Discovery Tours and if we go cack to Cape Town, which we hope to one day, we would love to go on another tour with them.

She made sure we saw every possible animal , bird and plant during the day.Her friendly company , her knowledge and advice made for a great start to our holiday.Choosing a private tour, though somewhat more expensive than a group tour,is well worth it and very good value.Yaseen dropped us off at the airport, where we were collecting a rental car to drive the Garden Route.

He was great about answering our questions, explaining the history of what we were seeing. He also gave us time to explore different areas on foot by ourselves, saying \"I'll meet you in front of that restaurant in 20-30 minutes\" so that we also had chunks of time alone, throughout the day.

So not only was it a beautiful trip, it was fun.On the second day, Yaseen\u2019s wife Tania took us into the wine country, where we visited farms we had requested and two they had suggested (Meerlust, Rust & Vrede, Thelema, Lynx in Franschhoek and Spice Route in Paarland). We had lunch at the Delaire Graff Estate which was amazing.That many wineries is a very aggressive schedule, and Tania adjusted the original schedule \u201con the fly\u201d to make sure we were able to see them all. These wineries were all great, Tania was a terrific guide, and we again had loads of fun.On the third day, Yaseen drove us to Hermanus, which was another great trip and well worth the time it took to get there.

He was friendly and enthusiastic. He made sure we got the most out of the trip, suggesting photo opportunities, making sure we saw as much as could within the the time we had. If we are lucky enough to return to the Cape Town we will definitely take another tour with Mark."

The Cape is a must for any first time visitor, it being some of the most spectacular scenery you will ever see. We stopped numerous times for photos, baboons, ostriches, Zebra flora and fauna.We ate at the Two Oceans restaurant with a table perfectly situated for the awesome views. Yaseen could not have been nicer and I highly recommend this tour.His wife Tania took us into the wine country and she was delightful. Spectacular views along with a scrumptious lunch at Delaire Graff Estates were the highlight of the tour. The wine country is an hour away from Capetown so a full day is advisable especially if you want to do multiple tastings.I highly recommend this company for those that want an intimate private tour."

We wanted a tour of Cape Point and surrounding area. We were picked up from our hotel in Cape Town very promptly and from the moment we were picked up to the time we were dropped off, we had an excellent day. Yaseen was extremely flexible and took us to the places we want to be and gave us as much or as little time as we wanted. We were not rushed around like all the other large tour groups. Yaseen knew everything about the local area including geology and wildlife. He was also an excellent photographer. We ended up at a wine tasting location which was excellent. The price was excellent and this is the way to see Cape Point and the surrounding area. We saw Yaseen a couple of days later when he was doing a tour for another person and he instantly came to say hello.Would definitely recommend."

We stayed at An African Villa on their recommendation which was perfect for us. Yaseem picked us from the airport and Tania gave us a personalized Cape Peninsula tour that included transport to the airport. Yaseem was very personable. I really appreciated that she appreciated my interest in birds and took the time to linger at a place known for whales. We saw a humpback tail slapping, which we would have missed if she had rushed us from one spot to the next. It was a great day!"

I think Tania gave us the Cape Peninsula tour after Mienta because she told us a SoCal woman discovered many Cali plants were native to South Africa. That's news to me too! Everything Mienta said plus all prior positive reviews are true. I only spent time with Tania but I've no doubt Yaseen is great too. She was very personable, enthusiastic (seriously guys!), knowledgeable and flexible. You'd think someone who has been doing this for so many years would be bored of their job by now, but they're not. Tania showed us the Cape Peninsula as if she were showing her friends a good time. I felt so at ease with her and my friend and I learned so much about the areas we explored as well as the general history and current events at Capetown. This truly set the tone for my short stay here and really made the experience personal for me. It's nice to see pretty places on a trip, but even better to understand the historical and socioeconomic landscape. One last thing, Tania really wanted to make sure we saw the animals in the area and spent much time tracking them down - unsolicited. Thanks to her efforts we saw bontebok, ostriches (an entire family!), birds, baboons, and many others I've now forgotten. Here I thought I'd only see the Penguins at Bouldersbeach. You won't regret using Discovery Tours and I hope to return the enthusiasm should Tania and Yaseen find their way to the States again."

I was looking for an option for private tours rather than joining group tours that were offered through the travel agency I used to book the trip. I\u2019m so glad that I made this decision! By opting for private tours, we were able to visit places and customize our time according to our interests, and we were lucky enough to genuinely like both Tania and Yaseen!Our first day was a tour of the Cape Peninsula with Tania. Spending time with her in Kirstenbosch Gardens was a great experience. She has a lot of knowledge about botanicals, and I was floored to learn how many plants found in Southern California are actually native to South Africa. We had a perfect day for enjoying the beauty of the land, and Tania was the perfect narrator. She recommended we have lunch at Two Oceans Restaurant at Cape Point, and it was a wonderful recommendation.We toured the Winelands the following day with Yaseen and had another perfect day. He kept us entertained, and I learned volumes about South Africa\u2019s history. We stopped for tastings at three wineries, each selected to offer a different experience. The lunch recommendation was Delaire Graff, and it was tremendous! Both Tania and Yaseen know and love their homeland and make great ambassadors to show it to visitors. I loved hearing about the history and the culture of the area; we learned so much from our time with them. Both have amazing energy and enthusiasm, and I really appreciated their honesty in relating what life is actually like in the area.I highly recommend using Discovery Day Tours for private tours if you\u2019re visiting Cape Town. They were very responsive through email while I was making arrangements, and they were great about personalizing things to our interests. Their restaurant recommendations were spot on, and it was so nice having them arrange everything for our bookings. They really know their stuff, and they\u2019re both great people that you\u2019ll enjoy spending the day with."

One of the things that impressed us right off the bat was the detail and promptness of their replies to our many emailed questions and requests. Our days with Tania were absolutely fantastic, we really couldn't have asked for anything better. It was great to have their proposed customized itinerary and then even better when she adjusted it on the fly to fit how we were feeling each day and the circumstances of the weather. Tania was friendly, knowledgeable and great company; we thoroughly enjoyed our time on her tours. She was prompt, well organized and arranged excellent meal options for us. We learned a tremendous amount about the area, the culture, the nature, the history and the people. She was very patient with our many questions and gave us great information that we are still thinking about. We are planning our next trip to South Africa already and one of the things that we know will be part of this future trip is that we will be spending more time with Discovery Tours.

We went to Rhodes memorial, Groot Constantia, Muizenberg, Kalkbaai, Simonstown, Boulders Beach, Cape of good hope, Noordhoek, Chapmans peak, Houtbay and Signal Hill.It was the best day ever! Not only because Capetown is just the most beautiful place. This day was also a great succes because of Yaseen\u00b4s enthusiasm. He knows everything. He likes it when you ask him as many as questions that you have. And also he knows what you need without you asking him. For me, for instance, i\u00b4m not a person who needs to have a extensive lunch. He knew that. But still gave me all the options. An other example is that i wanted to see the penguins very much. So he gave me all the time i needed at boulders beach.In other words, he 'reads' people. Which makes it so easy to travel a whole day together. Also, but that is personal, he has a great sense of humor which made me laugh more than once. In other words: this was a wonderful day with Yaseen as professional and wonderfull company. I would recommend this Discovery Private Day tours to anyone!"

I have to admit, I am not an expert on South Africa, but after only a week in the country, most of what I will have learned will have come from my time with Tania. Even in tourist places, she knows how to best avoid the crowds and how to protect you and other tourists (e.g., warning not to open car windows to get photos of baboons, etc.).They have been to the U.S. and have visited their former clients. I hope the next time they come to my country, I can return the favor and show them around my mountains and my protected wilderness areas (no baboons or penguins where I live though)."

Our group was visiting Cape Town on November 14, 15, and 16, 2014. We would all be arriving on the Holland America Ship Rotterdam.November 14, 2014, we were a group of 12 with 6 in each van. Our guides Tania and Yaseen met us at the port as promised at 8:30. Our first tour was their Peninsula Tour. We visited a shark lookout point for a fantastic view of surfers below and the lovely coast. We went to Simon's Town a quaint village by the sea. There we saw the statue of Just Nuisance (you will have to go there to learn his story). We saw penguins at Boulder Beach, taking a lovely walk along the coast to a second park entrance, what views! We arrived at the Cape of Good Hope and had lunch at the Two Oceans Restaurant. The food was great and view magnificent. We then took the funicular to the top for some more fantastic views. Cape Point was our next stop, again great views and a few seals to boot. The area was quite windy, somehow we avoided most of the rain that day. The HAL tour my friend was on went the opposite route we did and they got soaked. We were very lucky. Riding through the park we saw a baboon, ostrich, and two different kinds of deer. We then took Chapman's Peak Drive for marvelous coastal views. During the day we had seen False Bay and Hoek Bay. Our tour started at 8:30am and we got back to the ship at about 6:00pm. Tania and Yaseen were both wonderful guides going out of their way to please all. Everyone on the tour had a marvelous time. I was so happy! For anyone going to Cape Town by cruise ship or for a longer vacation I would highly recommend calling Discovery Tours, they are the most obliging company to deal with. All promises were kept and the tours we took far exceeded my expectations. This made me especially happy since I had made the arrangements. Thank you so much Tania and Yaseen."

It was obvious from our correspondence prior to the tour that Tania & Yaseen fully understood exactly what we were looking for. Our first impressions couldn't have been better. Yaseen arrived on time, was very friendly and got to know us straight away. The whole day was tailored to fit our requests. Yaseen could tell that we were very interested in wildlife and went out of his way to find as much as possible. Some of the animals we saw included ostriches, bontebok, dassie, fur seals, baboons and penguins. The trip was made more interesting by Yaseen's knowledge of both the area and the wildlife. We stopped for lunch at the 2 oceans restaurant and had a very enjoyable meal. As we were only in Cape Town for a short time we asked if it would be possible to end our trip with a visit to a vineyard. Yaseen ensured we got to do this, even though it made the trip slightly longer than expected. We really cannot recommend Discovery Private Day Tours highly enough. The trip that we experienced was very unique, great value for money and provided fantastic company."

This was not a rigid tour but was extremely flexible allowing us to spend as much time doing what interested us the most. Tania is genuinely friendly and got the right balance of feeding us information and leaving us to our own devices to soak in the wonderful surroundings of the landscape she is so proud of. We would never have seen some of the great sights and wildlife if we had toured the peninsula by ourselves. Strongly recommended."

We were on the HAL Rotterdam in November 2014 and had the pleasure of Tania as our guide for the Cape Point Tour on day 1 of our stay in Cape Town. I can certainly echo the positive reviews by previous TA reviewers. I think Tania has a gift to make you feel welcome as part of her circle of friends and family, so that it's more of a visit to a great city with someone you know than a typical tour. We had quite a few tours on this trip to South Africa, and without question, Tania was the best. I would not hesitate to recommend Tania and Yaseen for anyone travelling on the cruiseships looking for a private small group tour."

We toured the Cape peninsula, wine country and Cape Town itself. Yaseen proved to be a quick and good read of his audience. Thus, for instance, our wine country tour highlight was the chocolate tasting. We had plenty of outdoor time as well as a lovely flood of history and local tales to entertain and inform us as we drove.Yaseen has a rare gift. He can make the tour feel like he's doing it for time for friends. What a treat.We give Discovery Tours an unqualified five stars."

Yaseen picked us up in from our hotel, An African Villa (also highly recommended) for our private Cape Peninsula tour and was immediately full of stories ! We started off at the Cecil Rhodes statue to get the view and our bearings.He then took us around False Bay through pretty Kalk Bay and onto Simonstown.He told us not to bother going into the busy Boulders Bay Penguin colony as the Betty Bays penguin site near Hermanus was less crowded and more interesting.This turned out to be true!We were very impressed with the Fynbos vegetation in Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve spotting Bontebok. Eland ,ostrich and some very cheeky baboons rummaging through a lady's possessions(she had gone swimming!).After a very pleasant lunch at the Two Oceans Restaurant we took a three quarter hour cliff walk to the Cape of Good Hope where Yaseen met us having driven around.We were soaking wet having been caught in a squall at the top! We stopped again to look at fur seals and dassies.Passing through Ocean View (an inland settlement!) and onto Noordhoek on the Atlantic side ,we then drove the spectacular Chapmans Drive over to Hout Bay then over to Camps Bay 'where all the beautiful people live' and back to our hotel.Yaseen is very knowledgable and gave us many tips on later parts of our journey ,Wineries in Stellenbosch,the Four Passes route through Franshoek ,De Gelders for whalewatching and even a list of animals not normally seen for our trip to the Kruger.An amiable companion ,full of jokes(he called me the Rhodes Scholar as I had researched the day quite well) and never worried about stopping for a photo opportunity ,we had a great day and I can heartily recommend Discovery for any trips around the Western Cape ."

Both Tania and Yaseen are incredible at what they do. We booked two day tours with them: one around the Cape of Good Hope and one to wine country. A friend recommended Tania and Yaseen highly, but our expectations were totally exceeded. Tania picked us up at our hotel for our Cape of Good Hope tour and we immediately felt at home with her \u2013 she was warm and energetic. Tania led us to all of the most picturesque spots while sharing fascinating stories and facts about where we were, including a ton of historical knowledge and facts about the wildlife we saw. She was particularly good at identifying types of birds as well as sighting rare and beautiful birds when we would never have noticed they were there. Our wine tour with Tania was also a blast. She asked us what type of wine we preferred and customized our tour accordingly, including a stop at a champagne-only wine tasting which got our day off to an extremely fun start. All of the wineries that Tania picked were excellent and we were astounded by the scenery and wildlife in the region. We were lucky enough to meet Yaseen after our second tour \u2013 he could not have been warmer or more fun to talk with. Anyone would have a fantastic experience on a tour led by Tania, Yaseen, or any of their associates. Tania and Yaseen also introduced us to a few wonderful restaurants during our tours and recommended some of the best spots we ate at during our trip. We plan to return to South Africa within the next year or two and will absolutely use Discovery Tours again. Our vacation would not have been the same without Tania and Yaseen."

We pretty much put our entire experience in their hands, which was a gamble, but it paid off more than we could ever have known. On a hunch (based on warm and responsive emails) I scheduled 3 tours w/ them, along with transfer to and from Sanbona. We spent about 40 hours in the space of a week with Yaseen (Tania joined him for about 8 hours of it). They are the most warm and wonderful couple, but this review is going to be primarily about Yaseen b/c we spent so much time w/ him. I just cannot describe how special Yaseen is... VERY SMART and very knowledgeable about the history of South Africa. I feel like I should get college credit b/c I learned so much! He is so enthusiastic and GENUINELY cares about making your trip the experience of a lifetime. I am not exaggerating. Examples: He will insist on taking your photo, which is invaluable. In my experience, you have to ask for photos, but he knows all of the best places and will make sure you will remember that moment! He will clear crowds and yell at people (politely) to not walk into the shot, too. Heh. Gotta love that. He will make sure that, if you are sitting down for a meal, you do not get jerked around. He will actually come in and track down the waitstaff to get your bill for you, so that you do not waste one precious moment. Make no mistake--he is not rushing anything. He is just making sure that you don't have to lift a finger or experience any sort of stress. I wish that I could clone him and put him in every country so that I can replicate the amazing experience we had in South Africa. This is an excerpt of an email that I wrote him after we returned, and I think it sums up my feelings:I actually miss you already! You meant/mean so much to us. The time we spent with you was the best time of the trip, and mere words of thanks do not do you justice. I was flipping through some of the photos and was laughing at the moments you caught that I was not even aware of! Amazing photos. I will certainly let you know when I have gone through them and put them up online. There are certain people you come across in life that leave such an impression, it almost brings me to tears. You are a rare breed, indeed! I really cannot bear the thought that I won't see you and Tania again--the most genuinely wonderful couple! So we must promise to keep in touch, and I do hope we can meet up again, at some point.We cannot thank YOU enough for adding to OUR lives and making the trip to SA the best trip ever and one we will never forget!"

The next day we went on a tour of the Cape Winelands, including Paarl, Franschhoek and Stellenbosch. While the itinerary was well thought out and our guide Mark was pleasant, he was not knowledgeable about wine or wine making.

In fact, she made sure we saw two wineries in Constantia instead of just one. Tannia gave us such an insightful history of Cape Town and you can see her love for the city shine through her. She pointed out so many things to us that we did not know existed in Cape Town. She has such a wonderful and enthusiastic personality and is such a joy to be with.

She went way beyond the call of duty and extended our tour by showing us highlights in Cape Town. Tours were completely customizable and reasonably priced. Based on our preferences Tania picked out unique wineries with history, great tastings or special interest (like the Ernie Els winery). We were also able to tweek the itinerary because I wanted to get a little shopping in. The Cape Point tour was so beautiful and we stopped for all types of animals including the ostrich running around the light house. We enjoyed our time with Tania so much and invited her to lunch with us each day.

Twenty minutes later, we arrived at Delaire Graff Estate, and standing there was my boyfriend, who flew 6000miles with a ring in his hand and I said, Yes I do! With an awesome view overlooking the vineyard. It was the best thing that happened to my life!

We were in Cape Town on vacation over the last week of May and contemplated renting a car but we knew the driver wouldn't be able to admire the amazing sights and views of the mountains all over the Cape fully if we did that. Moreover, there is always the nagging worry we would inadvertently drive into an undesirable neighbourhood, so we decided to go for a private tour instead.Scoured the net for day tour companies in Cape Town and contacted Discovery Tours after reading all the excellent reviews online. We are so glad we did. Our email queries to them were responded to very promptly and our booking was confirmed in no time. We decided on the Cape Peninsular tour and the Winelands Tour.Tania picked us up from our hotel in a very spacious Volkswagen MPV. As it was just the two of us and Tania driving, we had plenty of room in the vehicle. We had a lovely time chit-chatting and driving through the beautiful small towns around Cape Town on our way to the wineries. Tania is obviously very passionate about her job and she has a wealth of knowledge on the area. She pointed out the various plants/trees indigenous to the region, told us the names of various wildlife spotted along the way, recount histories of the towns and wineries we drove by and the prominent personalities that influenced the area - it was a smorgasbord of amazing bite-size information which made our trip so much more enjoyable.Because we drank a lot in the morning and over lunch in the wineries, she suggested we go for a chocolate tasting instead after lunch. Fantastic idea as we ended up buying not an insignificant amount of chocolates from the chocolatier. We also stopped by Franschhoek briefly to stretch our legs and do a spot of souvenir shopping.Besides the Winelands Tour we also used Discovery for a Cape Peninsular tour. Again, Tania was a wealth of information which made the whole trip so much more enriching. She also has a very sharp eye for spotting wildlife - we saw ostriches, elands, baboons, springboks, antelopes, guinea fowls, zebras and various birds of which names I can no longer remember. Everytime she exclaimed 'look!' it was a mad rush to ready the camera and point it at where she was pointing. She timed the Cape Peninsular tour expertly so we could catch the awe-inspiring view of the sunset over Hout Bay. Pictures of it on the net do not do the place justice, you have to be there (at that time of the day) to experience it.It was a perfect two days we spent with Tania and we were almost sad when the tour came to an end. We became good friends over the short time we spent together. If you are ever in the Cape Town area and in need of a (customisable) private tour, you can do no wrong but to contact Discovery."

Many thanks Yaseem!"

Tania took us to the wine area on Monday and Yaseen to Cape Point on Wednesday. Both tours were fabulous and Tania and Yaseen were both so accommodating and really helped us understand the history and back stories of the area. Talk about diamonds of South Africa--these two are the real deal! On Monday we were looking for a bottle of kosher wine to take to a seder and Tania went out of her way to investigate this and find a place that would still be open later in the afternoon. Yaseen has such an eye for wildlife--we saw much more than we expected on our tour to the Cape. They both clearly have a passion for what they do. Highly recommended."

We enjoy traveling and we always look to tripadvisor for ratings and reviews and Discovery Tours is consistently rated very high. We\u2019re lucky to have Tania as our guide although based on all the reviews, the other team members are equally commendable and highly rated. The best thing about your own private tour is that you make your own schedule. Tania was very flexible with us. We\u2019d made dinner reservation at La Colombe at 7pm and she suggested that we could delay the start of the tour for an hour so we wouldn\u2019t have to wait around for the restaurant to open. On the day of the tour, Tania picked us up at the hotel and during our conversation, we told her we were not able to make it to Table Mountain the previous day due to weather closure. So she said she would make a detour to Table Mountain so that we could at least get some pictures taken. Traffic was bad and even though we didn\u2019t make it all the way up to the top of the mountain, we were able to get some magnificent vista at the cable car station and certainly, pictures for our memory book. A great start.We visited all the places covering Simons Town, Cape Point, Cape of Good Hope, Hout Bay, Camps Bay, Clifton, etc. We saw baboons, ostriches and visited a penguin colony at Boulders. It was a full day. We also requested Tania to make a lunch reservation at Two Oceans Restaurant at Cape Point. The restaurant was very busy but the food was served quickly. If you go, the Hake and Chips is to die for, also Tania\u2019s favorite. We also had the Signature Seafood Platter which is equally delicious. We still cannot stop talking about how delicious the meals were. We also want to make sure we mention about how attentive Tania was. We causally mentioned we were interested in those wire-bead animals that were very popular in S. Africa. And while we\u2019re visiting the penguin colony, Tania took the initiative to pick up 3 wire-bead animals for us from a street vendor who did excellent craft work. It was such a sweet gesture as the street vendor was gone when we finished at the penguin colony. In fact, she even tracked down the street vendor when we said we wanted to see the rest of his collections. Those wire-bead animals are the favorites of my daughters and grandkids. Now we wish we had gotten more. At the end of our tour, Tania made an extra stop to visit the Constantia Uitsig Wine Estate before dropping us off at La Colombe for our sumptuous 5-course tasting menu dinner. She did it because she wanted to make sure we\u2019re not too early for our dinner reservation. How is that for exceptional customer service!!So yes, we cannot ask for a better tour company or tour guide. Tania is remarkable and she made it a very special day for us."

We typically do not \"do\" tours but found that this company offered private tours for close to the same price as large group tours and the reviews from clients certainly helped in our decision. Yaseem and Mark were great guides and we learned so much from them. Mark took us on the western coast tour up to Paternoster. It was off-season for the wild flower display but he was able to show us lots of bird life. Mark's knowledge from being a previous ranger was amazing. We had been told by the company (and appreciated their honesty) that March was perhaps not the best time of year to go north. However, we still decided to go and because there were limited flowers to see, was no fault of Discovery Tours.Yaseem took us on our other two tours - Cape Peninsula and the Winelands. His knowledge of the area and his ability to perceive our wishes was much appreciated. Our experience with Discovery Tours was first class and allowed both my husband and I to enjoy the scenery rather than one of us driving. When we completed our last tour with Yaseem, he provided us with information for our onward driving through the Garden Route (most of which we took).Thanks Discovery Tours for a great experience."

We found Discovery Tours through our research prior to our trip to Cape Town, and after booking our flight transfers and a few tours through them, we also heard great things about Tania and Yaseen from the folks at An African Villa, where we stayed while we were in Cape Town.Yaseen picked us up from the airport when we landed, and started to introduce us to Cape Town on the way back to the hotel. We spent two full days with Yaseen, as he was our guide for both Cape Point and for the Winelands. On our full day Cape Point tour, Yaseen introduced us not just to Boulders Beach and Cape Point, but also showed us around Simon's Town, and a few lesser known gorgeous beaches. He was enthusiastic, entertaining, and an all around awesome guide. Yaseen gave us a bit of history and some culture background on the areas we visited, and it was refreshing to see how passionate he was about South Africa, and the Western Cape. Yaseen's car was comfortable, and he was a great driver. Using a private tour meant we were able to avoid long lines/crowds, as we had some flexibility with our detonations, and we were able to spend more or less time at each attraction as we saw fit. It also meant we didn't have to worry about driving or directions.Our second tour with Yaseen was a full day Winelands tour. We were able to see Stellenbosch and Paarl, and again got some history on the tour. We got to go to a few different wineries, as well as check out the town of Stellenbosch. Again, we had some flexibility as to which wineries we would go to and spend more or less time at. Yaseen was exceedingly flexible to our needs, and also took care of our lunch reservations based on what we were in the mood to eat that day. In the end were super thrilled with all of Yaseen's choices for the day.All in all, we loved how easy and stress-free (not to mention fun) the whole experience was. Yaseen made our first trip to Cape Town awesome! He made us felt very well taken care of, and we strongly, strongly recommend Discovery Tours for your Cape Town tourism needs."

We researched private tour operators in Cape Town and very fortunately chose Tania and Yaseen to look after us for 2 separate days, covering Cape Point on one and the Winelands on the other. Yaseen was our personal guide, and proved to be a fantastic guide and ambassador for the Western Cape, and South Africa in general. He's extremely knowledgeable, across all aspects of the area, combining with a great sense of fun, and ensured that we got what we wanted, as opposed to what we were given.Both Tania and Yaseen we're exceptionally helpful prior to our arriving in South Africa, by recommending sights to visit, timings and booking restaurants for us. When we had finished our 2 days, Yaseen produced a long list of recommendations/ideas for our ongoing travels through the country, most of which we took up.They both contributed to the wonderful time we had, particularly Yaseen, and we can't recommend them highly enough. If you want the best time in Cape Town and surrounds, get these guys to show you round!"

In this trip, Yaseen has shown us some diffirent places. Even in the same place, I have seen different views due to his great advice. For example, Yaseen led us to a place where we can see the back of Table Mountain with lots of people surfing. For the Cape Point, he suggested us to go to the top of the hill to get a bird's-eye view of Cape Point.

When I was kind of cheated by a local shop staff for buying 10 stamps although my intention was to buy only two, Yanseen bought the rest of 8 stamps and said he could use them in the future. When we had dinner at Camps Bay, Yansee offered to pick us up after dinner although the tour meant to end before the dinner.If anyone goes to Cape Town, Discovery is highly recommended.

We chose Discovery Tours because of its high rating on Trip Advisor and were not disappointed in the least. Yaseen picked us up on time at our hotel and we immediately felt at ease with him, which was important because we were going to be spending the whole day with him. It was a beautiful sunny day, and we first stopped at the Cecil Rhodes memorial, with its commanding view of the Cape Flats and mountains beyond, then proceeded to Simons Town to hang out for a bit with the penguins and on down towards the cape. Along the way we learned a great deal from Yaseen about the area's flora, fauna, and history and enjoyed getting to know him. We stopped at several scenic spots along the way, including beautiful Buffels Bay, which was deserted, and headed on to Cape Point, which definitely was not deserted but worth the crowds. Had a delicious vegetarian lunch at the Two Oceans Restaurant (didn't have to wait for a table, fortunately), then hiked up to the light house and its incredible views of the cliffs and ocean. Yaseen patiently stayed with his vehicle while we explored, then took us to the Cape of Good Hope sign, to another deserted windswept white sand beach, then in search of some wildlife. Yaseen's experience as a guide really paid off when we drove down a deserted secondary road to an area where we came across an ostrich, zebra, troupe of baboons, and eland-like animal--definitely a high point of an outstanding day.On the way back to Cape Town, we stopped by Noordhoek Farm Village and bought some great crafts at a shop there, snaked our way along Chapman's Peak Drive with amazing views of Hout Bay, and got back to our hotel before sunset.We unhesitatingly recommend Yaseen and Discovery Tours, and if/when we return to Cape Town we'll contact them for another tour."

Arrangements were made with Tania for the Cape Town portion of our trip and Yaseen drove us for each of the three days we had planned; Cape Town and environs, Cape of Good Hope and Wine Country. In our years of traveling internationally Discovery Tours is one of the finest tour firms we've used. Their patience with our group, flexibility with our schedule, knowledge of the country and it's history and just overall warm personality and good humor made this a very memorable visit for the six of us. All communications were responded to promptly, pickup times were right on the button and costs were very competitive. It was a sad moment when we parted company with Yaseen. You will not be disappointed with Discovery Tours."

We booked a two-day tour of Cape Town area and the winelands, one day each with Lyndsey and Mark, arranged through Discovery Tours.Lyndsey and Mark were friendly, knowledgeable and easy to talk with. The pace of the tour was fine...we did not feel rushed, and the vehicle was new and comfortable.We were impressed that they listened to our interests and tailored the tour to suit us...specifically gardens, flowers, and the Nelson Mandela statue at Drakenstein Correctional Centre near Paarl.We will highly recommend Discovery Tours to our friends back home."

If Trip Advisor had a 5 Star + or 6 rating I would use it for Tania and Yaseen.My wife and I booked them for a tour of the Cape and Wine Country 2 weeks ago. Communication was clear and prompt and their costs for what they provide are well worth it.Tania was with us for the 1st day and took us both to the Cape. She listened to what we wanted to do and tailored the visit accordingly which is one of the reasons I would recommend Discovery Tours as opposed to being in a small group with a fixed itinerary and timing. She provided us with a memorable day and her knowledge of wildlife, flora, fauna,history etc is excellent and this applies to Yaseen also.Second day in terrible weather conditions, gale force winds and rain, we were with Yaseen and despite the lousy conditions also had a great trip.In conclusion, for me the best evaluation of a Company or Service like this is, would you do it again and do you feel you made new friends and the answer on both counts is a resounding yes.Use them, you won't be disappointed."

We also used them for our airport transfers. I would highly recommend using them for both. Yaseen was waiting for us when we arrived at the airport, gave us a full day tour of constantia and cape point, and drove us back to the airport (very early in the morning!). He was extremely reliable, drove us around in a comfortable vehicle, and gave us a great personalized tour. The price was very reasonable, and it was so nice to have a customized tour.Our full day tour was wonderful. We were trying to fit a lot in, and Yaseen did a great job of moving us along so we fit everything in but also allowing us time at each location so we didn't feel too raced. We really enjoyed the whole tour - wine tasting, stops at little seaside towns, penguins, cape point, chapman's peak drive, etc.A real highlight for us was the wildlife. Yaseen spotted whales off the coast, took us to see the penguins and hyrax, and found baboons and ostriches at cape point. What really set the tour apart though was that he knew we had hoped to see the zebra at cape point (there are only 5 so seeing them is rare). He took this as a challenge and hunted to find them, and he succeeded! We were really excited to see them, and then he found the bontebok in the park as well. Don't think there were any possible animals to see that he didn't spot! Yaseen grew up in Cape Town, but he also spent time as a guide in Kruger - it showed!If we make it back to Cape Town, we would definitely use Discovery Tours and hope to have Yaseen as our guide again! He does a fantastic job of showing guests both the known tourist sites and additional specific places/things he knows they will enjoy."

Mark was such an excellent guide- he showed us not just the regional sights but really pulled us in by telling us about his family, where they worked, what they liked to do, etc. Mark spent years taking people up Table Mountain so he's also an expert in different types of plants and birds, so he'd randomly stop the car to show us different types of medicinal plants and things like that, and we really just had the best time with him. We went to Boulder Bay and saw adorable penguins, went to a cute spot to pick up some lunch and then he drove us out to the cape, where we had tea before driving out to the sign that everyone takes their picture in front of. We saw baboons, antelope, ostrich and when we didn't think we would, we finally saw zebra, which had literally come out right in front of our car. I got some amazing shots and the whole experience was breathtaking. After the cape, Mark drove us through a beautiful seaside landscape ending at Chapman's Peak before bringing us back to the V&A Waterfront. Couldn't have had a better time, so glad we booked with Discovery Tours. Thanks for everything!"

In late July we (2 couples) met up with Yaseen for a 2 day tour of Capetown prior to our going on a package tour of 3 countries in Africa. We arrived 2 days before the start to see some of the sights we would not see on our longer, more formal tour. We were not disappointed as Yaseen did an excellent job of getting us to several great wineries the first day and a great lunch at one of the wineries he selected. The second day covered several sections of Capetown, Signal Hill and a great stop at the gardens at Kirstenboch. We could not go to Table Mountain as it was closed for maintenance.Our foursome thoroughly enjoyed the tour and we wished he would have been our guide for the additional 2 days we spent in Capetown on our ither tour. Yaseen is very knowledgeable, has a great personality and comes highly recommended by us. We hope to get to South Africa again and if we do we will definitely use Discovery Tours!"

Yaseen, co-owner of Discovery Tours with his wife Tania, took my husband and me on a marvelous day long trip from our B&B in Capetown central all the way down to Cape of Good Hope and the Cape Point Nature Reserve, with several very interesting stops on the way. Yaseen is a warm, engaging person who combines superb professionalism with exceptional knowledge of the area. He tailors this day trip to suit interests and physical capability for a perfectly marvelous time. Yaseen has great enthusiasm for his home city which he clearly loves and has superb knowledge of the beautiful landscape, seascape and flora and fauna. The cost for this private guide service was so very reasonable and is well worth it to receive such first class, personalized service.

In planning our first trip to CT, we had no idea how to plan our time, where to go, how to get around, etc. So I turned to TA and found Discovery Tours aka Yaseen and Tania. Suddenly, my problems were solved. They promptly responded to my many emails, made very helpful suggestions, and were always willing to give me some pointers.We have just finished spending 2 full days with Yaseen and loved every minute of it. We toured the Cape Point on one day and the Winelands on the next. He made the time fly by with his knowledge, stories, sense of humor, warmth, passion, and extra touches (like buying us some local snacks to sample). I love peppering guides with questions to get a feel for the culture. Fortunately, he loves answering questions. We covered politics, religion, racial history, local customs, education, etc, etc. My wife and I really learned a lot. Like others have said, we felt like we were spending the day with a good friend.He also has some pretty incredible eyesight, as he spotted various wildlife as we drove around Cape Point. Yaseen is in his mid 50s. Tania is a bit younger. They have been married for over 20 years and have been doing tours for over 15 years. They were both born and raised in South Africa. I wasn't sure if they did a tour together or separately. Turns out they do them separately.One other point to consider. As part of my trip planning, I had emailed several other guides highly recommended here on TA for itinerary suggestions and fees. Discovery Tours was by far the most reasonably priced for the same tours. While that was great, I had some nagging concerns that we'd be getting a budget tour, or something of lower quality, despite the glowing reviews here. I am pleased to report that my concerns were completely unfounded. For instance, our tour was supposed to end at 5pm each day. However we ran an hour over on each day because we were having so much fun and Yaseen kept wanting to show us more things. Yet he never asked or suggested that we owed him a penny more than his quoted rate. My wife and I have no reservations whatsoever in recommending he and Tania, who we had lunch with one day and was equally delightful, to anyone."

We organised two trips with them and two airport pick ups and we found them to provide excellent friendly service, personally tailored to ensure that you can get the maximum of what you want from the trip.We organised two tours during our visit, one to Cape Point and One to the Winelands; on both trips we were escorted by Tania in a very comfortable air conditioned vehicle. Tania is very knowledgeable about the local area and history of the Cape and is very helpful in ensuring that the highlights away from the typical tourist trail are brought to our attention. We were able to see so much more at our leisure because of the thought and the planning that went in to design and timings of the trips.I would thoroughly recommend Discovery Tours if you are contemplating a trip to Cape Town and want to find out a little more about the local area. Discovery Tours can tailor the day to suit you and your agenda and also provide a great personal service that you will really appreciate.During our visit, I took numerous photographs of the wonderful inspirational scenery and I will have these forever; the memories of our trips with Tania around the beautiful Cape will also last forever.Thank you both for making out trip to Cape Town so enjoyable and memorable."

To clarify, this is more like a guided drive than a guided tour. Tania does not accompany you to each of your stops and as long as you are not expecting this, you will be very pleased. She is such a down to earth, lovely, kind woman, you cannot help but love her by the end of the day. Our day involved a stop at Kolk Bay, where we shopped a bit too long, a drive to Boulders Park to see the penguins then down to the peninsula. We ate lunch on our own there and met Tania about 4 pm for the return drive through Chapman's Pass I'm glad we asked about the famous sign because she decided to drive there for a picture which is when we saw ostriches right by the ocean! The drive back is stunning and Tania was more than happy to stop for photos along the way. Once back in Capetown, she learned we would not have time to go up Table Mountain so she drove us up and we enjoyed the panoramic view even though the venicular was already closed. It was a long but really enjoyable day and I truly felt like I made a new friend. Discovery Tours provides excellent value.."

I contacted them via their website and we arranged everything very quickly by e-mail. We have decided for two tours: Cape Peninsula tour we made with Tanya and Winelands tour with Yaseen. Both of them are excellent tour guides. They run family business and they really supplement each other very well. They were very open and gave us plenty of information: on the nature but also on the older and recent history as well as on the current situation. As they both come from Cape Town province a lot of info was based on their personnel experience. They helped us very much to understand South Africa. They also passed a lot of hints on Cape Town area. Regarding the tours as such, I do recommend taking both of them. Cape Peninsula is a must if you are in Cape Town area (including Cape Point and Boulders Beach of course) and Winelands tour helps you to understand the country ( not mentioning wine tasting). As a summary: fully recommended."

His sense of humour added to the enriching 2 days spent there!!He has a tremendous knowledge of things,people, nature and history of capetown.We were very happy and carry along with us fond memories of Cape and will definitely visit again.Cheers!!"

Yaseen greeted us warmly and right away inquired about our time in the area in order to tailor our day to ensure that we got the most out of the area. He couldn't have been more gracious with our questions or more obliging with photo stops. The weather was perfect, and we were able to explore and enjoy more than we had imagined. Spending the day with Yaseen was an excellent way to see the sights and learn about the Cape Peninsula and South Africa's history; we could not have accomplished all this on our own. It was a memorable day. Many, many thanks to Yaseen."

Her knowledge and obvious enthusiasm for what she was showing us, her quick reaction to tailor the tour exactly to our interests, and her gentle friendliness could not be bettered. She must have taken this tour so many times with strangers yet she made it all so special and fresh for us. We appreciated that there was no taking us to places where she gained a \"back-hander\" for providing customers. From our initial contact and enquiry there was quick response and efficiency. Certainly \"as good as it gets\", utterly recommended and anyone who manages to book a tour with Discovery Tours will be lucky indeed.Thank you so much Tania, and good luck for the future."

Even before I met them, I was really impressed with how quick my emails were answered as I was inquiring about the tours.

Tania and Yaseen are extremely knowledgeable and friendly pointing out facts and information in every direction. It was great to have these 2 locals that have so much history of the area spending the day with us. Unlike most typical tour groups, we got to see not only the main attractions but also stop by some of Tania and Yaseen\u2019s favorite local spots for picture taking, shopping and eating. Tania and Yaseen were so flexible in showing us around and were very attentive to what we wanted to see within each of our tours. They did not make us feel rushed. It is all about you having fun and exploring this magnificent place. From coastal beaches, spectacular mountain views, local shops, wineries, to interesting wildlife we got to see so much. Tania and Yaseen intentionally keep their tour groups small to provide you with that personalized experience, and you do feel it. I am so happy that I used Discovery Tours on this trip and would highly recommend anyone heading to Cape Town to contact Tania and Yaseen for a trip of a lifetime! Happy Traveling-"

It is obvious that Tania and Yaseen love Capetown and the surrounding area. Their knowledge of the history, culture, horticulture, animals, and geographical features of South Africa, is extensive, and they seemed to really enjoy, and take pride, in sharing their knowledge with us. During our two tours we saw everything we would have seen with organized group tours, but, with Tania and Yaseen\u2019s tours, being more personalized, we saw things and went places we would have missed with the organized tours.

We then continued on to the point and to view the whales. Which we were lucky enough to see.On our return trip, Tania stopped at a roadside market and even did our bidding for us. Those items were cheaper there than anywhere else in Capetown.We will treasure our day with Tania, and I'd advise anyone going to Capetown to contact Yaseen and Tania's private touring Co. for the best tour you will ever take.Thanks very Much for a great day!"

I shared these with Tania by e-mail, and she made sure our tour would be tailored to our interests.On the morning of our tour, Yaseen met us early at our hotel. As he drove, he shared the history and significance of the places we would visit. We learned about the area\u2019s history, animals, trees, plants, and flowers. Yaseen\u2019s easy-going manner is perfectly suited for giving private tours, and we quickly found ourselves engaged in conversation as among friends.We visited all of the Cape Peninsula\u2019s major sites, as well as some lesser-known locations in search of animals. We were fortunate to see: helmeted Guinea fowl, a rock hyrax, baboons, ostriches, bontebok, southern right whales, and African penguins.Yaseen was very accommodating in adjusting our schedule to match our interests -- even if it was just to please one of us. That is the beauty of being on a private tour with such personalized attention. By the end of our tour, we gained a great appreciation for the beauty of the Cape Peninsula. Our time with Discovery Tours exceeded all of our expectations."

During our time in Capetown we stayed at An African Villa in Tamboerskloof. Proprietors Louis and Jimmy recommended and put us in touch with Tania and Yaseen (Discovery Tours) for a shuttle to and from the airport. In our e-mail correspondence with Tania and Yaseen we learned that they also provided various tours of the surrounding area. We wanted to do a day tour but were initially hesitant. We were worried about price and were not exactly sure what we wanted to see. Tania alleviated our fears when she suggested we combine a couple of different tours so as to see just exactly what we wanted. She was very accommodating and we were given a fair price. We were blown away! We saw the False Bay coastline, the penguins at Boulder\u2019s Beach, took the funicular to the top of Cape Point (VERY windy when we were there), and did the scenic route to Hout Bay. (We actually saw much much more\u2026too much to mention.) The highlight of this portion of our day was the actual Cape of Good Hope and the surrounding Nature Reserve where we saw ostrich and baboons. (Tania shared with us an interesting story of her personal encounter with baboons.) We also toured the winelands where we saw the towns of Franschhoek and Stellenbosch (where we had ice cream.) We eventually ended up at Neethlingshof Estate Winery where we tasted some excellent wines. (Tania\u2019s knowledge of wine is outstanding.) All in all our day with Tania was probably one of the best days of our entire trip. She was so sweet, and so accommodating, and it was a joy to spend our day with her. It didn\u2019t feel as if we were on tour\u2026it felt like we were driving around with a long lost cousin! She was so casual and down to earth and easy to get along with. More than anything this is what made our day so special. We truly feel as though we\u2019ve made friends for life. Throughout our day Tania shared with us stories of Yaseen. We finally had a chance to meet him when he picked us up (EARLY) at our lodging for our ride back to the airport to go home. He was equally as nice as Tania, and we were sad that we didn\u2019t get to spend more time with HIM. We were truly sad to say goodbye to both of our new friends."

When we contacted Tania and Yaseen or Discovery Tours we expressed our desire and were pleased that they actually listened to what we wanted and set up three full days of adventure. While Tania and Yaseen have templates for tours that they do regularly, they were more than happy to adjust schedules and venues to accommodate our desires and requests. Tania was knowledgeable and fun throughout our day touring the winelands, even going beyond our scheduled amount of time so we could enjoy one last winery. Day 2 was spent touring the Cape Peninsula with Yaseen. Due to our penchant for bending our elbows and chatting with locals, we fell behind \"schedule\", but Yaseen made sure that we saw everything and the views and scenery along the Cape are not to be missed, nor is the sunset from atop Signal Hill. Day three was again spent with Tania and this time we traveled to Hermanus and were treated to whales jumping and splashing just off-shore as we lunched at a local seaside restaurant built into a cave on the rocky coast. From the time they picked us up at the airport to the moment they dropped us off, Tania and Yaseen were professional, friendly, punctual and most of all, they were fun to spend time with.

Our tour of the Cape Peninsula was fact filled and it was obvious that Yaseen quickly focused in on our interests and made sure to highlight them as we toured. On our Day trip to Hermanus, Yaseen not only found Right Whales for us to view, he got us as close to them as he could, away from the crowds where we were able to watch a mother and calf up close. He gave us a lot of valuable tips for our \"day on our own\" and the restaurants and activities he suggested really helped to make this a trip of a lifetime! The more time we spent with Yaseen, the more we all found we had in common. It felt more like we were visiting a friend who was showing us around town.

Yaseen went out of his way to drive us into some less traveled areas where we were delighted to see blesbok, eland and ostriches.We enjoyed a picnic on the rocks overlooking the ocean and watching the blesbok running in the meadow before us. We then went on to the Cape of Good Hope, which was very special. The scenery for the whole day was spectacula.rOur second day of touring we went to Hermanus to see the right whales. .On the way to Hermanus we stopped at a beautiful botanical gardens and several wineries for tastings. In Hermanus Yaseen spotted the whales and drove us right to a spot where the whales were- just below the cliff where we were standing! Awesome. The return drive had spectacular scenery. I felt like the drive was a cross between the Amalfi Coast and Highway One in California.It was a pleasure spending time with Yaseen.

Lunch at Delair Graff was magnificent.Not only did we get information about the Winelands but Yaseen gave us tips for our drive up the coast, everyone of which turned out to be something enjoyable or yummy or both!Could not recommend this tour company more thoroughly and it is great to give support to a small local business too."

The first day Tania took my wife and I on a tour of the Cape--Boulders Beach to see the penguins, Cape Point National Park and the Cape of Good Hope. She went out of her way to drive us into some less traveled area where we were delighted to see our first antelopes, baboons and ostriches. We then went on to the Cape of Good Hope, which was very special. The scenery for the whole day was spectacular. On the second day Yaseen took us to the winelands. We left the itinerary in his hands and he came through with flying colors. We visited several wineries, ranging from a very small, intimate one to larger, more modern ones. Tania made lunch reservations at the Delaire winery. We had a table with a perfect view and the lunch was absolutely delicious. Yaseen left us to enjoy our lunch and then came back to collect us when we were done. We visited the town of Franchoek, and thoroughly enjoyed that. Yaseen and Tania were so friendly, knowledgeable and easy to talk to (especially for a whole day). We couldn't have made a better choice."

We arranged for Discovery Tours to collect us from a cruise ship, with our luggage at 9:30 am for a full-day tour and a drop-off at the airport.Yaseen arrived at the arranged time and off we went for a day to remember. The mini bus was comfortable and air-conditioned and after many cruise ship tours at different ports, it was really pleasant to have the vehicle to ourselves and not have to share with up to 50 other passengers. The other big bonus was that we had our own personal guide with an excellent knowledge of the area as well as the local flora and fauna. Yaseen took us to all the places of interest and went off the main tourist routes at times to show us some of the beautiful, almost deserted bays. He also went to the trouble of taking photos of us at various points such as the Cape of Good Hope. Our full-day tour was thoroughly enjoyable and literally flew by.I would recommend Discovery Tours to anyone and will definitely use them again when we return to Cape Town."

What a beautiful country but history that takes your breath away and how fortunate I feel to have been able to visit South Africa. If you travel to CapeTown - you really should not think twice about booking with Discovery Tours. You can't find a better resource and they REALLY will make your time in South Africa a trip of a lifetime.Our group was so fortunate that we had the guidance and expertise of Yaseen and Tania from Discovery Tours. Not only did they take us to such beautiful places as we toured the Cape,and throughout the city, but they are so willing to share about their country BUT make you feel like family. Yaseen and Tania were so attentive to our questions and from the pickup at the airport until 2 weeks later when we left, they were WONDERFUL. It was such a gift to learn about plants, animals, the best places to eat and shop and how the history of Cape Town is intertwined with the geography and settlement from experts who judged their day based on if we had an awesome one. Yaseen and Tania made my trip to South Africa a GREAT ADVENTURE. I am hoping to return as there is so much more to see and learn and my first contact will be to Discovery Tours. Thanks Yaseen and Tania - -It has been a week since I came home and all the memories still have me grinning :-)"

We did a full-day trip with Discovery Tours down to the Cape of Good Hope with several stops along the way: penguin colony, botanical garden, cape point, lighthouse, etc... It was a private tour for us and our three boys (ages 7, 9, and 14) in a comfortable mini-van. I think it is important to note that Discovery Tours is not some huge travel company who books a zillion tours and assigns some random driver to take you around. This is a smaller company with an incredible focus on customer satisfaction. Our guide, Tania, was fantastic. She was warm, friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive to our every need. Pricing was much more reasonable than I expected for a private tour, and we got to pick our own itinerary! Why bother renting an expensive car and frustrating yourself with maps, directions, and driving on the wrong side of the street??? Just book a tour with Discovery Tours and let them handle it. All you have to do is sit back and enjoy the scenery as you drive through some of the most beautiful country in the world. Thanks, Tania!"

I traveled with a group of student nurses, RNs, and a Dr. from The Pennsylvania State University. We had the pleasure of working with Tania and Yaseen for two event filled weeks. Tania and Yaseen made sure to efficiently use every moment of our stay in South Africa. This husband and wife duo is so well versed in knowledge related to the environment and the local wildlife that every time you go for a drive or a sightseeing adventure you will feel like you are on a safari. Tania and Yaseen are very open to answering questions you may have about local history, news, or cultural practices. My group learned so much just from asking questions. Yaseen, as an avid reader and local of South Africa, has a special grasp on topics related to South Africa. Often the town and street names have a fascinating story behind its naming. One of my favorite days with Yaseen was when he took the group to the Cape of Good Hope. Yaseen drove us through a reserve on a path that usually only the locals utilize. We had lunch on the rocks as we watched a group of ostriches and bontebok in the distance. On our way out of the reserve a group of baboons passed in front of the vehicle. The mothers were carrying the babies on their backs and a few of the bigger baboons sat in the middle of the road eating protea. A few miles up the road a group of ostriches passed by our vehicle. I was inches away from an ostrich and able to see its beautiful big eyes. Tania and Yaseen always made me feel safe and comfortable while being so many miles away from home. Truly my time in South Africa would not have been the same without meeting these two passionate and extremely competent individuals. Baie dankie, Tania and Yaseen. Totsiens for now :)!"

It was a birthday trip for me so we wanted to make it special. Tania (one of the co-owners of the company) was really first class. She took us to a few smaller vineyards that we would have missed and then was happy to take us to the ones I had earmarked. A private car and driver may cost a bit more but well worth it. You can see a lot more, drink a lot more wine and totally relax. Tania was also easy to be with and did not mind taking photographs of my husband and I at just about every stop. The wine here is just amazing, don't miss the champagne house just outside of Franshoek and the Delaire Graff estate- just for the interior decor, this wasn't actually the nicest wine we tasted but did have the wow factor. Tania got us back safely, if slightly tipsy, and I can highly recommend Discovery Tours."

We were actually staying in Fish Hoek - which is a suburb of Cape Town not serviced by many tour operators as it is a half hour outside the tourist areas of Cape Town. Discovery was the only tour operator willing to pick us up in Fish Hoek for a nominal additional charge. They are very flexible and asked us when we booked what types of wines we prefer and just some basic information about my husband and I so that they could tailor the tour to us. We indicated that we would like a nice lunch with a fantastic view along with some interesting wine tastings.Our tour guide was Yaseen - the husband of a husband and wife owned and operated tour company. The day we went I woke up not feeling so hot and Yaseen changed around our day a bit so that we weren't doing a lot of wine tasting in the morning before the wonderful lunch location that they picked out for us. He also gave us time to walk around Franshoek and Stellenbosch which was nice as we still had some gifts to buy and were at the end of our trip.We went to a tasting at a winery that was 600 years old, another that had the most awesome chocolate and wine pairing, then a fantastic lunch at a very chi chi place with an incredible view, from there we went to winery sitting by itself in a beautiful valley and ended with a tour at a winery that gives all profits to its workers in order to house and educate them. Quite a day!I would highly recommend this tour. Yaseen was extremely interesting to talk to in between the wine tastings. He knows a lot about the history of South Africa as well as what is currently happening in his country. During the tastings though he leaves you to just enjoy the scenery and wonderful wines."

They are warm, friendly and personal \u2013 they had wonderful stories to share about the city and its surroundings. We\u2019ve traveled to many countries and been on so many tours but never been on ones that were this exciting. To the extent, we signed up for 3 tours but enjoyed their company so much that we ended up doing a 4th one with them. We hardly, if not ever, write much about our travels, but we could not resist writing about them\u2026.In terms of tours, we loved them all. The wine tour was exceptional and we couldn\u2019t have asked for more. Tania was so accommodating - since my wife is not too fond of wine, she went the extra mile and took us to a nearby lion park and showed us more of the scenery around. We loved the city tour as well \u2013 I think Yaseen effectively ensured we didn\u2019t forget the history of Cape Town. And I cant think of any other place we know our history so well!Cape Peninsula was undoubtedly breathtaking (and their best tour yet) and Yaseen made it extra special by taking us to the best spots where there would be no other tourists but you. The West Coast tour would have been the next \u2013 the park is truly wild and untouched and we were blown away by stretches of colorful flowers. And we did get the perfect postcard picture of Table Mountain in the background on our way back. It was the tour we signed up for after we finished 3 tours and it was the perfect ending to our trip \u2013 it was also unique in a way that we got to travel with both Tania and Yaseen together \u2013 which was loads of fun. If you\u2019re wondering whether you should save the 100-150 Rand / person and go on a group tour, I\u2019d say think again because there are probably very few places in the world you\u2019d get this kind of value and personal touch!

He took us to see the whales off Hermanus Bay, and the penguin colony. Nothing was too much trouble. We were taken off the beaten track to see things that we would never have seen had we tried to tour round on our own (inclusing wild tortoise, a puff adder and baboons). We stopped at the Henry Porter Gardens and were treated to a cup of tea at the garden centre on the way back to Cape Town. What a fabulous day - we won't forget it and hope to return soon."

Yaseen is knowledgeable, kind , caring and friendly. He gave us free time to wander around by ourselves. He also took us to places off the beaten track. Prior to selecting a guide he sent us many emails with great suggestions on our trip to South Africa. I have no doubt im my mind that Discovery Tours is the way to go.Bertie TragerNew York"

Not wanting to drive on the left and disliking bus tours, my husband and I booked four day tours with Tania, She helped us schedule our 10 days in the Cape Town area, being sure we had plenty of time to relax in between tours. First we did the Cape Peninsula, and Tania's delight in seeing the animals was equal to ours for the first time. Later in the week she drove us to Franschhoek, stopping at wineries along the way for tastings, and leaving us at the Plumwood Inn, one of her wonderful recommendations. A couple of days later she picked us up and took us to Hermanus, whale watching along the way. Upon our return to Cape Town, she drove us to the Western Cape to see the wildflowers, a glorious sight. We never felt rushed or as if we had missed anything. Knowledgeable, warm and friendly, we were sorry to see her go on the last day!"

We wanted a tour of the Cape of Good Hope and Winelands but did not want the tour bus type excursion. They suggested Discovery Tours run by Husband and Wife duo Yaseen and Tania.Our first private tour with Yaseen was for the sites around Cape Town then the drive up to Cape of Good Hope with several stops between. Having Yaseen as our guide proved very valuable. He introduced us to many different areas that we would have driven by in a tour bus or not known about if driving on our own. The highlight during our tour was spotting 4 Cape Point Zebra in the Cape of Good Hope National park. These species of Zebra are very hard to spot and rarely seen from the road so we had a nice bit of luck. We also saw Bontebok, Baboon, and Ostrich while making our way around this beautiful landscape. Yaseen also arranged a stop into Ocean View Township so we could distribute sporting equipment and clothing to this poor community. They were displaced from their homeland during Apartheid but never given their land back once Apartheid ended.The following day we visited the Winelands with Tania from Discovery Tours. She is a wine aficionado so she was able to guide us to 5 boutique wineries in Stellenbosch and Franschhoek regions for some tastings and a nice lunch. Stunning views of the mountains and ocean from this area left us gazing at the beauty of this place all the while sipping nice wines.After each personal tour, we felt like we had been old friends with Yaseen and Tania. They are very knowledgable and friendly and we would recommend a private tour with them when visiting Cape Town."

She did a great job, tailoring the itinerary to our family's interests, showing us all the neat little spots she knew about on both routes, and providing lots of information and insights during our tours. Our day driving to Cape Point, seeing penguins, baboons, ostriches and absolutely spectatular scenery was one of the high points of our trip. We particularly appreciated her flexibility when we toured the wine region. She really worked hard to balance the interests of our teens, who were not at all interested in wineries and the adults, who were very definitely interested in wine-tasting! She adjusted her tour times in order to drop us off at the airport (with all our luggage) in time to catch our flight home. After two days of spending time with Tania, we all hugged goodbye and felt we had been warmly welcomed by her to this beautiful city and region. I would highly recommend Tania and Discovery Tours."

She is very outgoing and friendly, and she is very knowledgeable about her country. We enjoyed both tours. In order to stay fresh, her approach is to take you along as if you were friends, and she sometimes stops as the mood strikes her to show you the sights. Generally this works well, but sometimes the stops seemed to be more for her enjoyment than focusing on what we wanted to see, so I suggest that you make it clear what you want to see. Nevertheless, we had fun and learned a lot, so I do recommend Discovery Tours."

Tania told us a lot about the history and geography of the areas we drove through, as well as the history of each winery. She was very knowledgeable, very easy to talk to and personable. It felt like spending the day with a lovely friend! We saw a variety of different types of wineries, had some time for souvenir shopping, and had three different wine tastings. Tania did not rush us in any way; she wanted to ensure that we got the most out of our experience. She is a very kind person, a knowledgeable tour guide, and a trustworthy driver.

We selected the company based solely upon the glowing reviews shown on this web site. Having obviously had no communication with Tania for several weeks, we wondered whether plans would go wrong, but Tania picked us up promptly at the pre-arranged time at our hotel door. We then enjoyed a thoroughly pleasant day and, in the interests of brevity, we can only say that the whole experience lived up to our high expectations. We endorse all of the tributes and compliments already recorded on this website. It is virtually impossible to find any aspect of the tour that could have been improved upon, but if we had to find something, it would be the fact that Tania timed our arrival at Cape Point to coincide with the funicular to the lighthouse temporarily breaking down!!! Nevertheless the walk to the top did us good after 5 weeks on board ship. Thankyou Tania for a wonderful day.Harry and Diana"

We had a great time; Tania of course knows where to go, but she was also eagle eyed in spotting game."

(Yaseen even proved his mettle when we sat for a relaxing picnic near the Cape of Good Hope, dashing to the car well before anyone noticed to prevent an oncoming baboon from getting into our things.)There may be less expensive options for guided Cape tours, but the experience was more than worth it.

He stopped frequently enough that we were able to take plenty of pictures, never got sick of riding in the car, and were always comfortable. As an avid admirer of Cape Town (you'll see what I mean), he has a wealth of knowledge about the city's history, its present culture, and was not afraid to share his opinions on its direction and future when we asked him. He had interesting insights into South Africa as a whole and answered our constant barrage of questions about language, culture, cuisine, and geology with a smile. He is an intelligent, articulate, funny and generally warm person. I'm not going to post pictures of our tour because no photographs could do justice to the sights we saw and you must see it for yourself. Thank you Yaseen for a day that none of us will ever forget!"

It was honestly one of my favorite experiences during our short, event-packed, 4 days in Cape Town. Cass was so welcoming, my mother and I made 4 traditional South African dishes (recipes that she has been credited with documenting so as not to be lost, which I think is so awesome) with Cass' instruction. Afterwards, we all sat down and ate lunch together. This is all right in her home, so intimate, and so much more than I expected from a cooking class. Our tour guide, Pam, was also with us the entire day. I cannot speak highly enough of her. She picked us up from our hotel and along the drive toward Cass's house, gave us a history of Cape Town itself and also what is known as Cape Malay cuisine. She is such an interesting woman and you can tell she genuinely loves the city and all that it encompasses! She took us by Truth Coffee before we went to see Cass, definitely worth checking out... It's got an industrial feel with the staff in steam-punk, Mad Max style attire; coffee is to die for as well, order the flat white, you won't be disappointed. Overall, you get a great history of the city without it feeling touristy, and, if you have a culinary interest, you cannot ask for a better experience than cooking with Cass. Bottom line, I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Cape Town, phenomenal experience!"

Taking the foodie tour with Pam is a great way to get the lay of the land. It will save you so much time later in your trip!!!She takes you everywhere and knows everyone. She introduces you to the locals, provides history, and by the end of the day you have a good idea of where you want to eat for the rest of your time in Capetown. She takes the guess work out of where and what to eat. I wish I had more time to experience more places. As an entrepreneur, I so loved learning about all the stories of how each person that we met came to owning their business. I loved learning about their ethnic diversity that makes up Capetown. Pam is incredibly knowledgable. She is very strategic about where she takes you and is good about listening to you and figuring out which restaurants are the best fit for you. As a solo traveler this was also a great way to experience Capetown with someone who felt like a friend. This tour is fantastic for a true foodie enthusiast."

It was the perfect orientation to the tour and the extremely deep & complex history of the city & nation. Throughout our two week in SA we kept thinking & talking about what Ryan shared with us. The foods were very enjoyable - ranging from savory samosa to vegan bunny chow...and the best darn coffee I have ever had. As a professional tour guide myself I can be a \"tough customer\" when taking a walk...but Ryan was simply fantastic. He was engaging, answered questions with clarity & depth. In addition, Pam was a delight to work with.Absolutely highly recommend Cape Fusion Tours!"

They were both perfect! Essentially, her tours are like going someplace really interesting and having a friend drive you around to all the cool spots and tell you all about everything you need to know. We learned a ton and had a lot of really cool experiences. The food was all amazing and we met a lot of really cool people. Pam is also very flexible - she was perfectly happy to hang around and wait while we hiked some extra trails at Cape Point and drove over to take triumphant pictures when we were done! All in all the tours were absolutely great - experiences you wouldn't get any other way. Highly recommended!! After receiving all sorts of terrifying warnings about how we should never walk in Cape Town (I went for work and got automatic security emails), we were a little intimidated at the thought of exploring on our own. With Pam, we got about 17000 steps each day - to let you know we really did explore a ton of the area and we definitely worked up an appetite for all the awesome food. Other people of course wouldn't have to walk so much if they didn't want to, but we really enjoyed it."

Pam sweetly rearranged her schedule to accommodate us as I desperately wanted to do this experience and it did not disappoint. From the visit to Truth Coffee to begin our discussion on apartheid to our visit to the District 6 museum, Pam helped us understand the history before heading out to Langa township.Once we got to Langa, we were so warmly greeted by Victor and the woman of the hour Mama Lindie. Our cooking class was filled with laughter, singing and dancing. Mama Lindie is fabulous, feisty and so kind. While we waited for some of our dishes to finish, Victor taught us about life in the township as well as Xhosa traditions before we got a chance to meet with the students at the cooking school. It was such a pleasure to sit down with the students, hear about their aspirations once they complete the course and talk about something we were all passionate about - good food. At the end of the day, we sat down together, feasted on our meal and shared stories. On the trip back into town, all of us were raving how the experience wildly surpassed expectations and was a highlight of the trip.Do yourself a favor and book this experience with Pam. If you leave S.A. without meeting Mama Lindie (and her students), you'll be doing yourself a huge disservice."

This was a walking tour of central Cape Town for the first 6 hours, and then a trip up to the top of Table Mountain.Pam was extremely knowledgeable about the Cape Town food scene, but also about the history of Cape Town and South Africa in general.We visited many small local food purveyors, such as a bacon shop, cheese shop, chocolate shop and central Cape Town winery. We stopped at a local woman's house where we were given a hands on demonstration of how to make samosas, and then enjoyed the fruits of our labor. We also visited the central train station, including the rooftop food stalls, where Pam had one of the purveyors give a talk about African food. Our last part of the tour was a cable car ride up to the top of Table Mountain. All in all I would not hesitate in recommending this tour, but perhaps ask Pam to tweak it just a bit. I think the time spent at the local woman's home could be shortened by about 20 minutes, and the time spent with the chef at the food stall on the roof of the train station needs to be shortened as well. The chef is very personable and enthusiastic about African foods, but he went on for about 15 minutes, when 5 minutes would have sufficed. But again, as I am sure Pam would tailor a tour for you as you request, I have no problem recommending her."

Lots of walking so wear good shoes and be reasonably fit. Regular stops for great coffees and small food offerings. A visit to Table Mountain was a highlight on a beautiful day. All in a great day. Our second day was a tour with Pam to the Cape of Good Hope and surrounding areas. Took the funicular at Cape Point to the top and walked down. Good decision!Brilliant lunch in a waterfront restaurant in a small fishing village.Our third day was a tour of the Stellenbosch wine area. Pam picked Mulderbosch for starters and then to two others. The choice for a wonderful lunch was La Petite Ferme.Pam is incredibly knowledgable, fired up, organised but endlessly flexible, well known and popular. She is funny, drives well in a first class vehicle and responds to every need. She is all over wine and food which suited us totally.If you want to get on one of Pam's private tours, book well ahead.

Seriously jet lagged and in awe of our beautiful surroundings, Ryan picked us up right on time and introduced us to Cape Town. We started off in colorful Bo-Kaap trying out some Cape Malay pastries, He then took us to two venues where we could witness traditional African beading, one of which was an awesome non-profit shop that enriches the lives of less fortunate native women while realizing their talents. It was great to bring home some pieces of art while supporting a good cause. Moving ahead, we enjoyed ice cream bunny-chow (SO GOOD FOR BREAKFAST) and other goodies, then finishing up with traditional pap and samp, curry and meeting some wonderful natives along the way.

He is very knowledgable about the regions and Cape Town. His tour was very flexible and we were able to add a tour of a car museum and one last stop at Meerlust which was our favourite for sure. Our third day with Ryan was a tour of Cape Town starting with a stop at Truth Coffee, then the District 6 museum and then to our township cooking class. As we were cooking Ryan took our cameras and got some great shots for us. He then drove us around the township and then to the spice shop with a final stop at the butcher shop to purchase biltong.

It was early so no wine-tasting here but Pam wanted us to experience the organic farm that is located on this winery. We arrived in time for a guided tour given by one of their knowledgeable employees and saw some beautiful sites also. You can lodge here and some of the rooms have kitchens. You are allowed to pick anything from the gardens and use. It was a great first stop! After that we were off to La Motte Winery for our winetasting. This is my first experience and it was fantastic. The wines were delicious and Pam is very well-versed about the winemaking process, the background on the winery and the history of the region. And we bought some great wines at great prices! Afterwards we went to lunch at La Petite Ferme. How delicious and what a stunningly beautiful locale!! We walked around the little town and did a little shopping before heading to our next winetasting in Stellenbosch. That winery closed a little early that day so we didn't have an opportunity for a second winetasing but that was really okay. Between the winetasting at La Motte and lunch, I was definitely feeling it! We walked around thte quaint streets of the Stellenbosch shopping area and learned more about the region from Pam.I highly recommend Pam as your wine region tour guide.

Took a one day tour with my wife, my daughter, and my daughter's friend, who are all either nurses or nursing students. Pam was wonderful, and able to provide information with regard to South Africa's health care system while driving to our various locations...information that was fascinating. Took us to the Waterford Estate, which had a wonderful tasting of wine and chocolate in a beautiful location...everyone enjoyed this immensely. As I am more of a beer fan, she tailored the trip to bring us to a local mini-brewery, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Brought us to a wonderful restaurant/brewery/chocolate tasting, where we enjoyed spectacular views while enjoying our meal...she also explained South African cuisine while we were eating. Since our daughter and her friend are staying in Cape Town through November, she also took the time to show them other areas that they may want to visit while staying in South Africa. Couldn't be happier....highly recommend!"

She went above and beyond to ensure that we has an absolutely wonderful experience. We walked around Bo Kaap and tasted food from various local restaurants. We went to some wonderful stores called Monkey Biz and Streetwires. (I highly recommend that you visit these places.) We visited a wonderful coffee shop called Truth where all the locals were so friendly and welcoming. We also went to Gardens and an outdoor food market where we tasted plenty of delicious foods and bought lots of souvenirs from local vendors. Anine tailored the day to our wants, and did not rush us at all. I highly recommend this company. If you use them, ask for Anine! For this type of tour you need to wear comfortable walking shoes and take some local cash with you because many of the local vendors do not accept credit cards."

My favorite though was cooking with Mama Lindy. Mama Lindy is a gem and the township cooking school is a wonderful community resource started from the ground up. I've now gathered all the ingredients from the class and I can't wait to have a dinner with friends and share all the recipes.All three of us had a great time in Cape Town and it was largely due to Pam and Anine.

My first day visiting Cape Town included District 6 museum, Table Mountain and Bo-Kaap with a visit to a steampunk coffee shop and cooking school with Mama Lindy - an event unto itself. I can't wait to try out my new recipes on friends. Day 2 was Saturday so a must stop, especially for foodies, is the Biscuit Mill. Not only was this a treat for the eyes, ears and taste buds, it provided many cultural insights in just one place. We then spent the rest of the day driving down the coast, visiting the Cape of Good Hope, seeing the penguins and other sea life. Day 3 was a wonderful visit to the wine country. This was a day filled with gorgeous natural scenery, Cape Dutch architecture, good wine and even a chocolate tasting.When we set out on our adventure, Anine had certain things in mind but as the three days went on she modified plans as she got to know what I liked and that I wanted to pack as much as possible into the time I had in her town. And, she knew everyone - from the gentleman at the District 6 Museum whose home had been in the District to various vendors at the Biscuit Mill, the doorman at the coffee shop and wine makers. My time with Anine was fabulous. I learned so much and had so much fun. I can't wait to go back and spend more time with Anine exploring her city and the area around it."

An interesting & revealing encounter where he explained with passion & pride the basic food from his & Nelson Mandelas heritage then prepared us tapas size portions of his home style fare. Enroute we explored various street markets and visited bead metal & craft workshops 'Monkey Biz' and 'Streetwires.' Our guide seemed to know everyone and couldn\u2019t have been more helpful and friendly. The tour went at our own pace, stopping longer at various places whenever we wanted. Thoroughly enjoyed the colourful houses of the Bo Kaap region, and a stop at a street punk style coffee place \u2018Truth\u2019 an artisan coffee house, where we were shown around and sampled the best coffee we had during our visit to Cape Town. There were only two of us so the cost was obviously more per head than if we were part of a bigger group, but was still excellent value for money\u2026.thank you Anine for such a sensational memorable day!"

We walked through many different neighborhoods learning about the history and culture of the areas and sampling their foods.These were items we were not likely to have found on our own. From a great potsticker by a famous chef's \"Street Food\" offshoot and a famous gourmet coffee roaster to bobotie, bunny chow, samp and beans, pap, chakalaka, koeksisters, and many more- many at street stands or very small out of the way locations. But it was also not just about the food (although that was admittedly my first attraction). Pam also took us to a few venues like Monkey Biz and Streetwires which are organizations that are starting to allow disadvantaged locals to begin to earn some income, in an area where unemployment is rife, by selling craft items they make.

What a perfect day we had visiting the Winelands with Anine!Her bubbly personality and enthusiasm meant we didn't even mind the rain!From our first point of contact with Pam who helped us plan our day, communication was so prompt and helpful.Luch and a wine tour at La Petite Ferme was wonderful with the most spectacular views. Sitting in a wine tasting lodge at Stark Conde with a log fire whilst nature provided a spectacular rain and hailstorm was magical!The lovely thought of a bottle of rose as I was celebrating my 50th was really appreciated. I would thoroughly recommend Cape Fusion and wish Pam and Anine ongoing success as they definitely deserve their positive reviews."

The first tour with Pam was beyond amazing so I wondered how she could possibly top my trip in 2012. Well no surprise - the trip was the most synchronistic memorable trip of my life. Considering I just turned 50 and have traveled extensively, this tour with Pam rises to the top of my memorable trips. Pam gives you so many options - you just go with what feels right for the day. She makes a plan but allows for detours and surprises all along the way. I did an olive oil tasting - love OO but hate olives. Not after trying Morgenster's olives and olive paste. I love SA olives! Coffee, wine, food you name it - Pam knows the best places in the Cape. Woodstock was pure entertainment from an artistic perspective as well as wine and coffee. I saw whales in Hermosa Beach - ate food everywhere. Just tell Pam what you like and she will find it and more. Don't even get me going on the desserts! Book a multiple day tour with Pam. You will not be able to get enough for Cape Town unless you do. You will become a repeat client. The best advice I can give - book far in advance and I promise you will have the time of your life!! And laugh - oh you will laugh. Pam - see you in October of 2015. Cheers from America (Golden CO). LOL. Oh - this trip was my total disconnect. Pam posted pictures on FB everyday so my family knew I was safe. Take your camera and comfortable shoes."

I was eager to tour a winery, but it had to fit into my schedule--and I had other ideas about what I wanted to see and do in my too-brief time in Cape Town. Too much to do in too little time, and a woman traveling alone to boot. She was very helpful from the beginning in helping me sort out the possibilities, giving me lists of restaurants, galleries, shops, and other places to see on my own. She picked me up and drove me to Constantia, but worked in many of the other sights, as well, making it a wonderful day. Her advice on where I could comfortably go alone was a valuable extra. Contact her if you're going to Cape Town--you won't be disappointed."

From the first communication she was responsive and easy to work with and planned an amazing day for us based on our interests of wine and art. She also was quick to adapt and suggest ideas throughout the day to ensure we got to see and do everything we wanted to. I'm in awe at how much we covered and got to do - and never felt rushed. She did a great job recommending a range of vineyards as well as key shops in the towns that were worth stopping in to that gave us an ideal overview of the region. We had a spectacular lunch at Delairre Graff and ended the day with a wonderful walk through the galleries at Grand Provence and the gardens of Babylonstoren."

It was the best decision ever! Pam was very communicative and asked for our input about what we were interested in seeing, doing, and eating, and she planned us three wonderful days. First day was the Cape of Good Hope, Boulders Beach Penguins, a lovely Mothers Day Lunch at Harbour House and all sorts of other little goodies tucked in between. That day we had Anine as our driver and associate guide and really enjoyed her as well. Next day was the winelands. Along the way we had tastings of beer, chocolate, cheese and wine and saw the beautiful wineland countryside. A lovely late lunch at La Petite Ferme followed, then an interesting visit to a car museum. Day 3 was a walking and tasting tour of Cape Town, starting in Bo-Kapp and ending at the Mount Nelson Hotel. We tasted all sorts of delicious traditional foods like samosas and bunny chow, stopped at a new winery tasting room, and also visited several Interesting crafty shops such as Monkeybiz and Streetwires. We were also treated to a visit with David, who makes the most delicious stew with Pap and Samp, and sells it from a kiosk at the Transit Station!Pam was very communicative, prompt, friendly, fun and outgoing. She adapted to our interests and was flexible if we happened upon something that we found interesting. She was an absolute font of information about Cape Town past and present, as well as South African history. Pam has both the knowledge and the contacts to custom tailor her tours. We thoroughly enjoyed every minute of all three days....Thank You so much Pam and Anine!"

Pam McOnie is an ebullient sparkplug of a personality and the ideal guide to take my partner and me through the Cape Winelands. About a month prior to flying to Cape Town for vacation, I contacted her company, Cape Fusion Tours, about booking a Cape Peninsula tour for which she was not available. She immediately referred me to Lesley Cox of Amber Tours, who did a spectacular job. Pam made a smart, customer-first business move because when Lesley turned out to be unavailable for the Cape Winelands tour, she referred me back to Pam without hesitation. I think this clever networking all turned out for the best because Pam certainly knows her local wines and describes the area with great enthusiasm throughout the tour. A full day cost the two of us cost us R 2500 (approximately $240), and this consisted primarily of traversing between the two key towns in the region, Stellenbosch and Franschhoek, presumably the Napa and Sonoma of South Africa.We made stops at three wineries plus the Delaire Graff Estate to enjoy the eclectic art amid elegant surroundings as well as lunch at La Petite Ferme, a popular, rustic-elegant restaurant with a lovely hilltop view of the vineyards and the Berg River Valley. Our first winery stop was at the Waterford Estate, an exquisite chateau-like setting in the Blaauwklippen Valley, where we were served a satisfying wine and chocolate pairing in their courtyard followed by a brief tour. Next was the Stark-Cond\u00e9 winery in the Jonkershoek Valley, where we were taken to a charming small island in the middle of a lake where they conducted their tastings. Last was the family-owned Fairview winery famous for their cheeses and where in fact, we were served eight cheese bites to go with all the wine samplings. Pam certainly demonstrated a great deal of stamina in not trying any of the wines since she was driving. I would definitely recommend her services without question since she placed focus on our interests first."

The day was brilliantly structured to cover all of the ground we could have ever wished for with great care and attention to detail. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and clearly new many of the managers of the restaurants and vineyards and their staff such that we enjoyed a lot of personal attention even down to where we were seated that really contributed to the overall experience. Our guide was always happy to explain historic and points of interest and shared her knowledge which covered a wide range of expertise on locations and places that most tourists would never find. We had a great time and shared many amusing events with an endless variety of things to see and do from traditional to trendy, quirky to the totally unexpected which all contributed to a memorable experience. Above all the service was really relaxed from being picked up at our hotel in the morning and being returned in the evening with whatever time we wanted to spend at each location. This is a highly recommended experience for all age groups as the tour guide takes a lot of care before you travel to tailor the trips to your interests and goes out of her way to provide interesting and amusing content that is very customer focused."

My girlfriend and I spent half a day with Pam on a cape malay cooking tour.We were collected from our hotel by Pam at 9am and we started the day in one of cape towns lovely coffee houses (which roasted it's own beans). Over coffee Pam explained all about the history of Capetown to explain the roots of Malay cooking in South Africa. We then moved onto District 6 where we explored the wonderful District 6 Museum. Then it was off to the Malay area - Bo Kaap. We did some spice shopping then we were off to do some cooking.We arrived at Gamidah\u2019s house in Bo-Kaap where she taught us some of her family recipes. We made a Malay chicken curry, samosas, chilli bites, rotis and finished our feast with some of Ghamidah's home made koesisters. It was great fun getting our hands dirty, rolling out rotis and folding samosas.The whole day was great and one of the best experiences we had in Capetown. Pam was very good at explaining the history of the country. While Gamidah was so good at teaching us her traditional family recipes. Both of our hosts during this tour were really fun and outgoing and really made our day.I'm sure I'll now be cooking a lot more Malay food!"

My husband had communicated with Pam before the trip on what type of wine,food and atmospheres we enjoy and left it up to her to pick the wineries. She did a fantastic job. She selected the Spice Route(where we also did our first chocolate tasting-so fun), Tokara, Stark-Conde, Ernie Ells, and lunch at Overture. She was a great guide giving us history of the cities and wineries along the way. Sometimes it can feel awkward to spend your entire day with a guide you do not know but right from the start when she picked us up, Pam felt like a friend. We had great conversation all day. I would absolutely recommend her! This day was one of my favorites of the entire vacation."

That was one of our favorite meals for the entire 3 week trip.We were all impressed with and enjoyed Pam's passion in the sharing of knowledge not only of Cape Town and the surrounding area wineries and restaurants but also the history of the areas we visited and her country in general. Pam was very accomodating and patient with our group when we would spend that little bit of extra time looking or exploring at some of our stops. Pam was not only interested in telling us about herself and her country but she was also interested in finding about our family. We will definitely look her up the next time we go to Cape Town and arrange another tour.

I have come to know the area very well and regard it as a home from home. You might be wondering why then am I still using a local guide each year?The answer is really simple. Pamela McOnie is not just a local guide, but she must be the best connected guide, and the most enthusiastic foodie in South Africa. A wine day with her tends to involve not just tastings, but drives through some of the most picturesque scenery on earth, cellars tours and sometimes even meeting wine-makers. Pam is exceptionally knowledgeable about South African food and wines.Cape Town is not one of those places that you can turn up at the last minute and expect to dine anywhere, as we found on our first trip there - we ended up eating in our hotel most nights, as everywhere worth dining was enormously booked up. Now Pam books restaurants for us, and they will often be top flight, not-what-you-know-but-whom-you-know hard to get in to places, and on top of that she generally books us the table with the best view. If every destination had a Pam, the world would be a more enjoyable place."

What a lady - bubbly and so easy going, knows the very best off the tourist track spots and is keen to share her vast knowledge of the area whether this be history, conservation, the best bars and restaurants - you name it and she has it. Unfortunately her popularity meant we could not secure her services for the wine tours we wanted to do but here again she sorted us out with another small independent (and I think over time these two have become good friends) who was simply great too - another fantastic day tour.I cannot recommend Pam highly enough.

Her explanations illustrated by her experiences of student life in the 1990s provided an insight into the dramatic changes that have happened in this beautiful country over the last 20 years. Cape Town does not advertise its changeable weather but the rain and wind at Hermanus did not dampen my enthusiasm for the views of the Southern Right Whales lolling around in the bay a few metres from the shore.

We were introduced to Pam and Cape Fusion Tours by our hosts at the Welgelegen Hotel in Cape Town. My wife and I truly enjoy traveling the US and the world to find small boutique vineyards. Pam picked us up for a full day tour of Stellenbosch and took us to Meerlust, Starke-Conde, Ernie Ells and Delaire Graff. Lunch was at the exquisite Overture restaurant at the Hidden Valley Winery. Each wine estate was wonderful and we were able to sit outside at all but Meerlust to take in the view and enjoy the wine sampling. We\u2019ve included some pictures and though we are shy about putting ourselves on TripAdvisor, just imagine us sitting at a comfortable table, our glasses full of delicious reds and whites, and looking out at the scenery that you can see in these photos. But truth be told, wine was only part of the Cape Fusion experience. Pam McOnie has an encyclopedic knowledge of South African history and geography and combined with her always positive personality was the perfect tour guide. For the better and the worse she gave us candid explanations into Cape Town history and answered all of our questions. And she shared with us recommendations for the rest of our time in Cape Town that made the honeymoon even more memorable. Lunch at La Colombe. A visit to Harbour House in Kalk Bay. The cheetah rescue experience at the Spier Wine Farm, just to name a few. And for the Johannesburg leg of our trip she introduced us to a local tour guide there named Kenny Letshesa Takalo. I could write a whole rave review about that experience alone but this story is about Pam and Cape Fusion. I would simply say we so enjoyed learning Johannesburg history from Kenny that we extended our honeymoon a day in order to spend not one, but two days in nearby Soweto. Think about that for a moment\u2026 But like I said before, the Cape Fusion experience was more than just getting out to great wine estates and enjoying the vineyards. It was the genuine desire of Pam McOnie to help you learn what makes South Africa and Cape Town such a unique and beautiful place and to help you make the most of your visit there\u2026while enjoying a great lunch and a bottle or two\u2026or three\u2026or four. :)"

Also nice to travel with a group of young people to get to know each other easely and become friends! Definitly would reccomend it!"

However also, I enjoyed the Zipline/canoeing/the Monkeyland/the forests/Safari and sightseeing.Our tour guide \"Lourrens\" is talented, passionate and so funny, and one of the reasons why I enjoyed the whole experience.I would, surely, recommend Cape Xtreme to any one who would like to have a similar tour in the beloved South-Africa."

I was on the 5 day Cape to Addo tour.Before the tour my questions were replied to quickly and in full by the staff in the office via email, the tour information is quite clear and while on tour I didn't feel like I'd been over promised at all on what I would see and do.During the tour we had the greatest tour guide ever in Machiel... and ive been on a few, he was enthusiastic and knew a lot about a lot in South Africa and is more than happy to share that knowledge with the group. I've seen in the past that a tour guide can make or break a tour and Machiel definitely made it. The tour itself is well laid out and there is a good mix of driving and attractions, you don't feel like you spend to much time in the bus even though you cover a lot of kilometres, there is also some adaptability in the tour and Machiel gives you options as you go for little side trips if the group wants to go. Accommodation is backpacker dorm style and the places you stay are very good and clean so no worries there, and there is an option to stay in private rooms if you want at an additional price... so if you are afraid of snorers or are one yourself... take this option. Breakfast and dinner was included and was always good and I never went hungry... the stand out meal though was definitely the Braii on the 1st night at Cape Agulhas Backpackers... that bread they made was amazing!!!, lunch we sorted ourselves but were always taken places that it was reasonably priced and still a good feed.  During the tour I had a problem of my own making..losing my ID and debit card, Machiel went above and beyond to help me and I really appreciate the help and support when changing my plans during the trip... it worked out in the end as I got to spend an extra day on the tour. And a big thank you to the boss of the company who stepped in and helped me out even more.  So to sum up, a great tour, a great tour guide and a fantastic experience all around. Cheers guys.James"

            "review": "Awesome services & amazing experiences! [6 day Garden Route tour]. We joined a 6 day Garden Route tour with Nadia HUGO in early September 2016. Awesome services: Nadia was the best tour guide we ever had! She's warm, friendly, funny and crazy as hell! But when it comes down to serious business, she's hands down the best as well. - Very knowledgeable. Ask her anything! If she doesn't know, she will take the effort to find out the answer.- Amazing driving skills. Some parts of the route were tricky, for example, the drive back from Tsitsikamma was shrouded in darkness and it was raining, and the narrow mountain roads were winding downhill. Nadia was steady all the way and we felt really safe with her driving.- I was hesitant when presented with the option of either the game drive with her, or the national park rangers. We chose to go with Nadia and never regretted it! She showed us many animals up close, while cleverly maintaining a safe distance, and knowing when to approach and when to retreat. Gives you ample time and angle to take nice pictures/videos.- Helpful porter. It's a backpackers' tour, but she helped to load/unload our giant 27\" luggages without hesitation or complaints.- Makes great recommendations about food and souvenirs to buy, but never pushy about it.- Follows through and great post tour service! Actually we booked the trip (10 day Cape Town & Garden Route) through another agent (SABP tours), who must have outsourced to Cape Xtreme / Cape to Addo. While the SABP agent was slow in their response to our queries, Nadia went the extra mile to ensure our arrangements after the Garden Route tour ended were seen to - the one day Peninsula tour and a paragliding booking, and even our airport transfer on the last day. Kudos to her for helping us even after her segment was done! Our paragliding was unfortunately cancelled due to strong winds, couldn't reschedule as our flight back was the following day. Nadia helped to arrange for the refund when we were back in Singapore. With this lady, you never had to worry about anything at all. Boss/owner: please notice and give this lady a promotion+raise!Amazing experiences:- breathtaking scenery throughout the 6 days, including beautiful sunsets everyday- up close with many animals including ostriches, lemurs, cheetahs, elephants- adventures to remember for a lifetime, including adventure walk in Cango Caves, safari drive, Bloukrans Bridge walk and bungee jumping (if you dare, totally optional), zip lining through the canopy and falls, canoeing in the river and hiking.Accommodation:- nice, safe hostels with great food,- especially their company-owned private house at Sedgefield!All in all, THANK YOU to Cape Xtreme / Cape to Addo and Nadia for a wonderful experience! :D"

I took the 4 days garden route tour. I have must have to say this is the worst tour I've ever joined. The poor rating of this review is hugely due to the tour guide of my trip.Our guide exhibited unprofessional attitude throughout the journey-complaining about the traffic, the weather and impatient with some of our tour members. Most of the time we hadn't got a clue what would happen in a day until we got to a place. He was generally frustrated towards our questions and requests. e.g. when being asked about which route in the Addo elephant park we are having our game drive, he simply answered 'I don't know, we'll just drive around.' e.g. arriving at Knysna Heads view point, we got there quite late and it was nearly sunset and we had only less than 5 mins before the sun went down. As a photographer, every minute counts to catch the sunset and I was desperate to get to the viewpoint so I asked twice about the path to the viewpoint. He simply didn't bother answering and kind of insisted that we walk slowly there. We had a bad weather on our first two days and the tour guide was so confused regarding what to do in such weather and he openly expressed his frustration and confusion...For sure in such weather condition we can't really do much (zip line, elephant & monkey sanctuary), but for a tour to still run in such condition, the tour guide is responsible to help the group make the most out of everything, or at least should be the first to exhibit a positive attitude.In all four days, few of us felt that this particular tour guide was rushing to drop us off at the attraction and the backpackers so that he can have his free time. There was minimal explanation about the location that we passed through while on the bus, there was no photo stops (except the one in Kynsa Head that was stated in the itinerary). He was always in a rush in every stop, wanted to get us to the hostel as early as possible each day. The garden route itself is underwhelming, it is not as scenic compared to the surrounding of Cape Town, it's better to spend your money and time elsewhere. Note for all the travellers, you might want to enquire about which tour guide you are having before signing up."

Lourens Pretorius is a top notch tour guide who went above and beyond to ensure everyone enjoyed the tour. Even more, his infectious personality made it virtually impossible for anyone to have a bad time. His candor was even more refreshing. He resisted the urge to baffle the \"tourists\" with BS. He said honestly when he did not have the answer to a question. And he did not give false information to seem more knowledgeable. And he was as accommodating to everyone equally. Truly made the trip that much more enjoyable."

After, we had a three day tour with the Cape Xtreme crew where we were able to visit a game reserve, an elephant sanctuary, go bungee jumping, and cage diving with great white sharks. They were extremely well organized tours that provided all of the logistical support and transportation back and forth from hostel to adventure sight. The staff was hysterical and was always there to provide a laugh. I would go through Cape Xtreme again in a heartbeat, for a relaxing way of getting the most done in a short time with great people!"

This featured a game drive at Garden Route Game Lodge, a visit with the elephants at Indalu Game Reserve, and a trip to the Cango Wildlife Park. I spent six weeks in South Africa and this tour was easily one of top highlights on my trip. Our guide, Werner, was extremely knowledgeable, passionate about his country and the places that we were visiting, and had so much heart. He was a very open, friendly, and personable guide. After a short time, it really felt like he was just another well acquainted friend in our travel party who happened to know everything about everything. He told us stories of the places we were visiting, just driving through and so many interesting personal stories of his life in South Africa. It gave such a nice, personal touch to the tour. It added a real human element beyond \"So this is this place...Any questions?\" I'm so glad he was our guide! The tour itinerary is a MUST for any animal lovers and I'm very happy to say that all of these animal facilities are top notch! Excellent rescue and conservation efforts. You can feel good about the experience that you'll have with this tour as well as the experience that the animals that you meet are having too!While this was the only tour with Cape Xtreme that I had a chance to do, I would definitely take another (And hopefully longer!) tour with them when I return to South Africa. And trust me...when you go, you'll want to go back too!"

Since that is a weather dependent acitivtiy, I booked the Cage Diving tour and the Absolutely Unique Cape Peninsula Tour with Cape Xtreme with the request to switch the dates of my two tours if there are weather issues. Bronwyn was very repsonsive to my inquiries and confirmed they will be able to do that. The Shark Cage Diving tour (operated by White Shark Ventures) proceeded as scheduled, however we were only 30 minutes at sea when the operator indicated the winds picked up and they needed to turn the boat around. The other groups on the tour that booked with the operator were offered a voucher for another cage diving tour that most weren't able to take advantage of as they will not be in Capetown for the next scheduled dive. We also couldn't make the next scheduled dive and Cape Xtreme promptly refunded the Cage Diving portion of our tour costs within a week; the transportation costs were not refunded as it already occurred.We thoroughly enjoyed the The Absolutely Unique Cape Peninsula Tour. There were approximately 10 people total on this tour."

During my short (and not enough) two-week time volunteering there, I hopped onto my roommate's 3-day Garden Route tour. The scenery and location speak for themselves and it is crazy amazing (you roll to where Leo Decaprio has a home, interact with elephants, and even get a chance to dive with crocs and pet baby cheetahs). But, what made the tour is the tour guide, Gareth Dale. Solid man, who actually grew upon along the path of where the tour goes and knows his s****. Really friendly and flexible, never felt hurried or that it was \"his\" tour; rather, he molded to what the folk in the group (about 7 of us) had energy and a liking for, with obviously a goal of hitting the best parts. Great experience, great guide, and so glad I did it. HIGHLY recommended."

He not only had a lot of knowledge that he passed on to us, but he made everything we did fun! In between and after the activities on schedule, he tailored the tour to our needs and wishes. We were a group of 10, consisting of 9 girls as this is a great and safe way for women travelling on their own. The tour bus is comfortable and spaceous, the hostels are great and well chosen! The activities were also nicely picked out, offering a great variety to consider everyone's needs, from thrill-seeking to chilling on the beach. Every day is always packed with things to do, without being stressful or overwhelming - it was always the right amount! Activities include canoeing, surfing, game drives, climbing/acro branching, bungee jumping, elephant interaction, shark cage diving and many more. Basically everything the garden route has to offer! (Maybe a suggestion to the organisers: skip Tsitsikamma scenic walk to have more time in Jeffrey's bay for e.g. beach horse rides etc). I have absolutely nothing to object and would recommend Cape to Addo and Cape Xtreme Tours without hesitation!"

The hostel at Jeffrey's bay is placed right above the beach with a stunning view over the ocean and 2 minutes walk to the water! Breakfasts and dinners included were ok - you weren't hungry. Lunches at the gas stations were bad - fatty and with no taste so ask the guides to try and find other places..! Included activities like the Cango Caves adventure tour and the Elephant sanctuary were good and the extras like the 216 m bungy jump and zip lining over nice waterfalls was very good. I changed the game drive for surf lesson and got a very professional teacher which, sad to say, didn't help..:-)Last line - you get more than you pay for with this tour"

When we arrived at the safari site we changed vehicle and started our adventure where for a small fee we met,fed and walked with the elephants, it was amazing. We moved onto another site and for another small fee where we were issued with wellies and a stick and walked with the lions, they were huge but amazing. We got brilliant pictures, as the guide took our phone. not the usual when you usually go places and they try and sell you their pictures.We met back up with Garreth and he took us to the house that we were all staying in, which was great and very comfortable. We met loads of interesting people who were also staying there and doing different tours. Here we met the other tour guides one being Gavin who was also very nice and made everyone welcome. Between them they prepared a barbeque and we all sat catching up before we headed to the beach bar, which was a good end to a brilliant day.The next day we left at 7:15 and headed to Cango Wildlife Ranch, this was another great place to visit and seen a lot of interesting animals, where you can also pay a small fee to have an encounter with some. Before heading back Garreth took us to a great wee place for lunch, where we had the most amazing milkshakes.Even when we headed back to Cape Town his still continued to inform us about the scenery and what to look out for (baboons being one of them). We arrived back at out hotel after the best two days we as a family have ever had.I would highly recommend this company as the tour was very reasonably priced and very professional, as if the rest of the tour guides are as good as Garreth you will be in very good hands.{You may even be lucky and get him}"

Totally worth it, so many pictures to be taken, and probably some of the best scenaries I've had the chance to see.We liked our day some much that we decided to book later on our trip the Garden Route tour for 3 days with this tour operator as well. Although you must be aware that this is a long drive from Cape Town, the activities were totally worth the wait. On your first day, you get to see wild animals in a game reserve, then have the chance to walk with the lions. On the second day, you first visit the farmers' market where you can buy souvenirs and food. After, you are heading to Bloukrans Bridge for the highest bungy jump. You will also have the chance to ride and walk with elephants in a sanctuary during the same day. Finally on your third day, you'll visit the spectacular Cango Caves. This is like a marathon of activities and the guide will offer you to add some more if you have spare time. You can also go after dinner if you are up to it. They have a private hostel, but you need to share a dorm during your two nights... unless you pay more for a private room. The only negative point, they had no wifi in the bus, even though they said they would. Not a big deal when you consider all the stuff I did, but I like companies that stick to their promise and the ride what quite long.. Wifi is avalaible in the hostel though.Although this whole tour was quite expensive (knowing you must pay each activities separately from the booking price), this was the best time I've had during my six-week journey in Cape Town. Small group, fun atmosphere, crazy activities, knowlegeable guide, MUST RECOMMAND!!!"

It was hot and sunny but felt cool as the sand is cooled underneath by water, so you could even go barefoot. The boards that you just velcro to your feet are better than the ones with snowboarding bindings. It is a little bit hard to turn, but it was also fun just to slide down sitting on the boards."

Though I was the only one from older age group, I never felt left out. We had plenty of activities, long scenic drives, good food and good guide- James. Nadia from the company was also there for the trip and she also contributed to make the trip enjoyable for everyone. The guide went the extra mile to accommodate my requests and saw to it that I was comfortable. He was always there to accompany me whenever he could when I did the Birds of Eden as the rest of the group had gone to the elephant park. We had lot of fun during the trip and we could manage all the planned activities within the short span of time. Thank you James and Nadia.All the girls did the bungee jumping and I had my fun watching them! Food at the B&B was simple and home cooked and very tasty . I really enjoyed both the dinners.If you have less time for sight seeing in SA, then I would recommend this well organised tour.I also did the shark cage diving tour arranged by Cape to Addo. It was also well organised and saw many sharks at close quarters.Stephanie from the office was in touch with me, followed up with me thro email while planning the trip. It was really a pleasant experience planning my trip with her. Thank you Cape to Addo for the memorable trip"

The guide was mindful of going an appropriate pace for the group but only stopped once to get pictures. Really good fun and value for money, the only thing that could have made it better (apart from the sun!) would have been letting us free at the end to go at our own pace as my husband was stuck behind me in the line at my speed. Great company, professional and good communication, would definitely book with them again next time we are in Cape Town!"

We won the lottery on tour guides with getting Lourens. If you have time to wait for a good guide -- get this guy. We went on several excursions while we were in Africa and this guy was our favorite.

It is (compared to others) so cheap and you'll get in touch with so many other people. In our tour bus, we had 9 different nationalities. You stay in really good accommodation near beaches or other beautiful landscapes. In my opinion the tour is very good planned, because you are starting at the ocean to see whales or dolphins, later riding on through the beautiful landscape of the \"route 62\", then watching animals in parks or national parks (addo elephant park).To be honest, we weren't really convinced of doing a group tour at the beginning, because we are not the kind of people who want to have a plan in holiday. But we realised that this is the best way to get to know new people, to get around very cheap and to get the first touch with South Africa. And now, to be honest again: it was a great decision. We found new friends (you are travelling with a majority of young backpacker), had great fun (like ostriche riding, kayaking, hiking, cage diving with crocodiles, etc.) and had an awesome guide: he was a great cook, driver, guide and also a friend. He always tried to please everybody and also told us really cool facts about South Africa and the locations we visited.We are still talking about this trip and won't forget the fun we had. We are really convinced about it, so I don't see a reason not to book it when you are in Cape Town, looking forward to have fun, facts, animals and South Africa as you want it!"

My husband and I, both seniors, opted for this budget safari even though the company warned us that our traveling companions would much younger than us and that the tour was geared to a younger age bracket. We took the 7 day Cape to Addo tour in January 2014 and we enjoyed every minute of it. Our driver and guide Nico picked us in Hermanus where we were staying with friends and we then met our traveling companions. They hailed from Argentina, Brazil, the UK and the Netherlands, and we all enjoyed one another's company throughout the entire trip. We spent 7 interesting and adventure filled days together. The program was varied, balanced, and interesting. We watched our companions bungee jump from the Bloukrans bridge, joined them zip lining, hiking, and swimming in some of the beautiful beaches where we stopped along the way. The itinerary followed the Garden Route and included visits to many natural wonders, such as the Cango Caves. Our trip culminated in the visit of Addo Elephant Park where we took an early morning game drive with a park ranger during which we saw lions, tens of elephants, jackals, zebras, etc, followed by another drive with Nico who took us to another section of the park where we saw many more wild animals. The accommodations where we spent the nights were all comfortable, clean, and well situated. The guest house at Sedgefield was located near the beautiful Myoli beach where the owner of the company Gavin, and Nico our guide drove us before dinner, for a memorable swim in the sunset. Everything about this trip was enjoyable and Nico spent a lot of energy to insure that everyone was comfortable and had a good time. His efforts were successful. It was a wonderful trip."

We booked (Rather late, as usual with my family) for a wine tour of the Winelands region of Western Cape, and gladly my endless search directed me Revel who went out of their way to accomodate my large party on a one day notice of intention to partake on a tour. The tour took us to Paarl, stellenbosh and Franschoek regions to some fantastic wine tasting venues (Not the commercially known wineries, but some true hidden gems of the region) for some vino tasting and interesting pairings with not only food but chocolates and cheeses (Try the Marble cheese from Fairview). Jimmy Took us off the beaten track for some insightful and knowledgeable tastings and visiting, even going as far as taking us to see the prison from which the Great Madiba was released from (not Robben Island for all you self appointed Mandela fundis out there), which was off the tour route but worth the visit, and even at a stage assisting on one of the wineries to provide us with information on the wines being served (yes by him as well), to which i might add was delightful and surprising and he kept all in a familiar tone and funny. Revel went out of the way to provide us with a modified rate to accomodate us and not just sticking to the price is this take it or leave policy that some other operators stick to. I recommend you give these chaps a call to book you next tour. I am definitely putting these guys on my speed dial to kill off some items of my bucket list.

Martin Hitge picked us up at our hotel in Capetown on a Sunday morning and we soon got acquainted with a group of delightful traveling companions from Austalia, Brazil and the UK. We were in for a fascinating and varied travel experience. Our first stop was Hermanus, the world's whale watching capitol. We then visited Cape Agulhas, Africa's southernmost point, where the Atlantic and Indian Oceans meet. Monday's highlight was a visit to the Cango Caves near Oudtshorn, South Africa's ostrich center. That evening we were treated to ostrich steaks from a local ranch. They were delicious, like eating a very tender beef steak. Other highlights included a stop at the Bloukrans Bridge, where some of the younger members of our party partook in the world's highest bungie jump. A hike along the coast in Tsitsikamma National Park on a rainy morning provided spectaucular views of a rugged coast, a chance to see many wildflowers and rock hyrax, the closet living relative of elephants. Game drives in Addo Elephant National Park provided an opportunity to see large herds of buffalo and elephants as well as zebra, kudo, warthogs, jackals and other animals. A special treat was a stop at Botlierskop Farms where we had the opportunity to walk with Mufasa and Lyla, a pair of young, very well trained lions. We could even pet Lyla on the rump. Our accomodations were backpacker lodges. They were simple but clean and comfortable. Martin, it was a great trip. We would do it again.

            "review": "Definitely the right thing for young people to do. I came back on Sunday from the 3 Day Garden Route Tour and I must say that this is the most amazing thing I have done here so far. We were picked up on Friday morning by our tour guide to drive to our first stop, a Game Reserve, to do a Safari. We saw lions, elephants, zebras, giraffes and other animals. It was really cool because you get really close to the animals, especially the giraffes. After that we went to a place where we had the chance to walk with the lions. This was an amazing experience! The lions were really calm and I was not afraid at all. We even got the chance to touch them, and I took a lot of cool pictures.On the second day, we went to an Elephant Sanctuary, where we could walk with the elephants. Later on, we were allowed to take a ride on them. We also went to see (and experience) the highest Bungee in the world at the Bloukrans Bridge. For all those people who are adventurous, this is the right thing to do! People who did not want to jump could still enter the bridge and see their group members facing the fear. The team on the bridge was very cool; they were very encouraging and even had a DJ table. The music really helped and got us in a party mood so that we would not get too anxious about the jump.On Sunday, we could choose between the Cango Caves and the Cango Wildlife Park. I went to the Wildlife Park where I was shown all the different animals, but the coolest thing was that I got the chance to pet a tiger! The whole trip was an amazing experience. I got so many chances to do things that I have never done before. The time you spend in the car to get from one activity to another goes by so quickly, because we were driving through the most beautiful landscapes. Our tour guides were very keen to make this trip a unique experience. They were very helpful and made sure we had a lot of fun. You could always go for a beer with them after the trips, so it felt like a big group of friends instead of tourists and tour guides. All in all, this tour absolutely is the right thing to do if you\u2019re young and looking for an adventure. After the trip, you will have so many cool pictures to make your friends back home jealous! ;) I also checked other tours on their website. There are a lot of other things to do such as a Surf & Safari Tour or a Wine & Whales Tour. Just check out their website, there will definitely be something that you will like!"

My boyfriend & I were very impressed with the service we received from Cape-Xtreme / Revel Adventures Day Tours.We came to Africa on 3rd March and pre-booked all our tours and activities through Cape Xtreme. Our contact, Pinda, was always really helpful and even during our stay she has kept in touch, has been incredibly informative, honest and friendly. She has been really genuine throughout and has helped us to fulfil our trip to the best it could be.We did cancel one of our planned activities (we decided in the end that one was too far away), and Pinda kindly arranged for us to go on a complementary sunset cruise followed by a 3 course evening meal at City Grill as she knew we were spending the day at the waterfront. It was so thoughtful of her, and we even saw some southern right whales even though it's not the right season for whale watching.Both Pinda and James Adams (our tour guide) have made our trip truly amazing and bothare incredible assets to this company. We will definitely be recommending Cape Xtreme / Revel, and when we come back to South Africa we will definitely be contacting your company first!Thanks again to you and your wonderful staff for making our visit toAfrica everything it could have been and more :)"

Before departing for my trip I contacted DC Tours based upon the reviews and signed up on-line for the Cape Peninsula Coastal Delight tour. Sign-up was simple and I had regular contact via email from Darren prior to the day of the tour. It was a Sunday and he met me at my hotel right on time. I was amazed to find out that I was the only person on the tour that day! I wouldn't have blamed Darren if he had cancelled on me but I'm glad he didn't as it turned out to be a fantastic private tour. Overall, I echo what all of the other reviewers have said. The sights are fantastic, the food at Two Oceans was outstanding, and Darren's a very safe driver with a very nice van. But most of all, Darren is exceptionally pleasant and customer service oriented. In fact, because I was the only person on the tour that day, we had some extra time and he took me to the Groot Constantia Winery for a wine tasting on the way back to my hotel. A bonus that is not typically on the tour but a perfect way to end an excellent day and tour. Contact Darren.... you won't be disappointed!"

Now we know why they were 5 star reviews.From our first contact with Darren to our last we had fun. He picked us up from our AirBNB accommodation on time and is a new clean van. By our first stop we were like old friends. The rest of the day was filled with information about where we were going and what we were seeing, stories and laughter. I have dodgy knees so taking stairs was at times a challenge for me. Darren made sure he took me the route with least amount of stairs or shorter distance and if we had to go the longer way he said I'd be rewarded with an awesome view and he wasn't wrong. It was worth the extra steps. At no time was I rushed, and Darren was always checking I was ok and there to help with a hand if I needed it.As it turned out there was only 2 of us on the day trip so it was really personalised to us. We could spend as little or as long as we wanted at stops and Darren was always on hand to take photos of us and being a keen photographer himself helped us get the best shot of scene.Darren thank you for a great day and keep on 'working it' and 'visiting those penguins' lol"

He is both knowledgeable and passionate about the Region and he manages to provide it in as much or as little detail as you want from him, based on your interest of any particular topic. Darren was quick to understand our interests and adjust our itinerary and even made adjustments on the fly to ensure weather conditions worked to our favor relative to the places we were seeing....without missing anything over the three days. I also enjoyed the fact that a number of places we experienced were off the beaten path, including a few nice local restaurants that were his favorites and not those highly frequented by tourists.Darren also has a great eye for photography and identified opportunities for good shots that weren't always apparent to an amateur like me. He even took photos with his own camera of things he hadn't noticed in his previous trips and even shared them with us afterwards. If you're spending any time in Cape Town, I highly recommend giving Darren a call!"

My good fortune was that Darren Combrink, the owner/operator of DC Tours had a space available in one of his groups and we were off the magnificent Franschoek area on a crisp spring Saturday morning.Spoiler alert: this was a wine tour. Much frivolity and joy can be seen the photos and could be gleaned from my review!Darren was a great tour guide and host. He's knowledgeable about the Cape, easy to talk to and fun to ride with. A better trip I couldn't think of. With little things, he adds great value to the journey: on-the-bus WiFi hotspot so that guests can update Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc during the journey; facility for guests to charge their smartphones as one chews power taking so many pics.We first stopped at Chamonix wine estate and began a delightful, progressively tipsy day of wine tasting. Chamonix has a lovely old-world-Cape charm that even so early was pleasant. Unfortunately we weren't staying to eat, but I suggest that you give their outdoor dining area a chance.Next up was Haute Cabriere wine estate, the home of Pierre Jourdan wine. What a magnificent setting for a superb tour and tasting experience. Taken underground to their cellers and given a delightful, fun and humourous talk by one of the family was a treat.We enjoyed a pleasant lunch high up the mountain-side overlooking the Franschoek valley at Le Petit Ferme, after which a stroll through the main street of town meant encounters with the creativity and magnificent art galleries that the area is renowned for.I was quite sad to the day end, but glad to get a rest before heading out for a night on the town.I highly recommend the professionalism and charm that is Darren Combrink and DC Tours."

When I was deciding on doing the tour, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to fit the tour into my busy itinerary during my short stay in the Cape, but Darren made the decision easy by offering to take me to the airport at the end of the tour so I could make my continuing flight to Johannesburg. I'm grateful that I was able to do everything on my wish list, due to his help. The day I went on the tour was a picture-perfect day, and all the places we visited -- Hout Bay, Chapman's Peak, Kommetjie, Cape of Good Hope, Boulders Beach, and Simon's Town, to name just a few -- were gorgeous.

From our initial contacts via email months ago, Darren has been responsive, knowledgeable and very helpful.The day before our tour, we made a special request of him and he pleasantly complied. Darren is comfortable to be around and has an amazing grasp of history, culture, and wildlife. He is really thoughtful and had a snack plus water as well as binoculars and bird, animal, and flower information sheets to use as needed. He adjusts to the personalities of his clients - he can be quiet or have a great conversation with you. Darren keeps updated on everything related to each of his tours. He worked with us on our interests and time constraints. The San People cultural tour was an incredible experience and we wouldn't have known about it without Darren. The Fossil Park was fascinating and we were happy we took the extra time to go there. This is not Prime Season for West Coast National Park but Darren brought us to absolutely beautiful places, and pointed out wildlife and birds. He knew we would be interested in an educational building there. He introduced us to a wonderful restaurant that served excellent ethnic food in a lovely setting.

Darren arrived early and well prepared for our trip, we weren't really sure what we wanted to see, other than I had my heart set on the penguins at Boulders Beach, so together we decided on the Cape of Good Hope and it was a fantastic choice! Darren was knowledgable, friendly and easy going, found us lots of non-touristy view points & animals that we wouldn't have found on our own. He knows Cape Town and it's history like the back of his hand! Detours were made to show us extra places of interest such as vineyard grounds and a local township, he even happily took our photos throughout the day, stopping to update his own collection also, showing a genuine interest and passion for his job, wildlife, nature and his home country! Wouldn't hesitate to book again and recommend to all! Emily & Stuart, Leicester UK"

My family and I booked two day tours with Darren from DC Tours while in Cape Town over the December/January holiday period.The first was a day out in the beautiful winelands of Franschhoek: the day began with a cheese and wine pairing at Fairview (one of the older wine farms, with famous cheese and wonderful wines), followed by a wine tasting at Haute Cabriere (some more wonderful wine coupled with exquisite views). We had lunch at Cafe Bon Bon and finished off the day with a chocolate tasting at Huguenot Chocolates, and a wander around the lovely Franschhoek village. The second was the Cape Peninsula Coastal Delight tour. This beautifully scenic tour took us from Sea Point, around Hout Bay and on to Chapman's Peak Drive, all the way around the coastline to Cape Point. We hiked (not really a hike but a slightly challenging uphill walk) to the lighthouse, which was followed by a delicious seafood lunch at Cape Point restaurant (very good food, and great service!) After lunch, we wound our way through the Cape Point Nature Reserve (spotting lots of baboons along the way!) and continued on to see the penguins at Boulders Beach. This wonderful day was topped off by cake and tea at Rhodes Memorial.Everything about both these tours was incredibly well organised - all the bookings were done by Darren beforehand - which enabled a very relaxing and stress-free experience! Darren is an excellent guide. He is very knowledgeable about Cape Town and expertly answered all our questions - he certainly knows his stuff! We had such a great time and we were all quite sad to leave the comfort of his minibus at the end of the day (his bus even had wifi!)We would definitely recommend him and DC Tours to anyone wanting to discover the beautiful Cape - we can't wait to visit again and experience some more tours with Darren!!!"

From the moment he picked us up at the V&A Waterfront (because we stayed quite a bit away from the city), he made myself and my mother feel so comfortable, like we've known one another for ages! He is very knowledgeable, super friendly. We've made a new friend in the Mother City! He is quite the happy snapper when it comes to taking photos, so there's almost no need for you to take your camera along on this trip. Any trip with him is highly recommended, as he goes the extra mile for you, and personalises the tour according to your needs. I misplaced my camera bag somehow, and two days later, Darren found it in the tour bus. He drove to the Waterfront, while we happened to be there, just to get the bag back to me. He is an absolute gem!"

A fabulous day starting with a trip up the mountain via cable car - we were the first in the queue and it was a stunning clear but chilly start - stupendous views from uptop and we joined the free tour at the top which was interesting. Then we headed up signal hill - fabulous view of the city , then to the Noon day gun - what an experience. Then headed into Cape Town via Bo Kaap, taking in the history and the sights....narrow streets and lovely old architecture. Lunched in town at a Moroccan bar on the street. Fabulous d\u00e9cor and menu. Winter in May but we were now boiling hot and so the excellent selection of beer was very welcome. Probably the best service we had the whole holiday - friendly, professional and excellent quality. Loved that lunch! Then it was off to the Castle - A fort that was built by the Dutch East India Company between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is the oldest existing colonial building in South Africa , then to Rhodes Memorial and another stunning view - and very interesting and impressive legacy of the man who was both a benefactor and a ruthless capitalist - ending the day with a beer and tea and a sinful lemon meringue at the Rhodes Mem caf\u00e9. Wow - an amazing day.It was wonderful to be treated to this wonderful day hosted by Darren - he is so organised and knowledgeable - it was a memorable day. Thanks!"

All were answered truthfully and mind you, without a blush.He produced out of nowhere this wonderful lady Sherrie who had lived through the historical times who gave us first hand accounts of what life was like then, having actually become personally involved in the struggle. What she described was eye opening. The living quarters of the slaves, the clock maker and Oom Samie Se Winkel the old curiosity shop in Stellenbosch, the second hand dealer in Stamford, the Jordanian sand bottle artist in Hermanus and the penguins of Stony Point were some of the unusual items of interest along Route 44, in addition to the grand architecture and dwellings of a by gone era in Pniel and Franschoek and the tasty Malay cuisine at the home Mrs FaizaWe were so glad that we did the tour with Darren and his team.

He took our family of 5 on two private day trips, Cape Peninsula and District Six/Langa Township.He managed to combine his vast knowledge of the area as a local with an easy ambience and attention to detail making our tours tailored to our wishes and seamless in management. But we had fun too!! And learnt so much. The Cape Tour was fabulous, with personal touches such as providing cold water bottles, showing us where he surfed as a teenager, taking us to the non-tourist side of boulders beach, reserving us a great view lunch table at Cape Point restaurant, giving us a choice of wine estates, even keeping us calm as a wayward baboon came to check us for food whilst watching the ostriches!! All the while giving us snippets of local info, historical references and current political news. The tour to District Six and Langa though was something else. He introduced us to a whole subject matter that we had very limited knowledge of previously, and it opened our eyes to the huge traumatic politics of apartheid in this area of SA.David took us to the museum which was fascinating, and then a car tour of the area including the now very desolate district six and showed us with very precise knowledge where the old tracks and houses were, where the remaining churches and mosques fitted in.David has a very good friend and working colleague, Odwa, a wonderful and clever 26yr old man who was brought up in Langa Township, and still lives there. Odwa took us on a walking tour of the township, he reassured us of our safety and of our being very welcome, and that the local people would be very pleased to open up their homes and show us how they live. It blew our minds away seeing all the housing/shelters and what the township means to the people who dwell there. We visited the orphanage and saw the children's beautiful and fabulous welcoming dance. It was truly humbling. Would thoroughly recommend taking your children there and meeting Odwa and hearing the story of Langa. "

Karen our guide picked us up from our hotel on time and immediately put us at ease with her friendly approach and informative chat about Cape Town. The drive down to the Cape was really interesting and alongside the scenery we saw a huge variety of birds, animals and flora, with Karen able to give us a great commentary on what we were seeing. Excellent lunch at the Two Oceans Restaurant with great views. The afternoon saw us taking in the Boulders Beach peguins and then the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens which really are a \"must see\". Overall an excellent tour and well worth the money."

Matthew had very interesting information about Cape Town, and it was really great hearing about the area from someone who grew up there. The van was very comfortable with only 6 of us for the day. We hit all the big stops and had plenty of time to hike up to the Cape Point lighthouse, take pictures, hang out at the beach with penguins and even got to spend an hour at Kirstenboch. Wonderful views and beautiful weather all day. Had a great time and I have already recommended this tour to another couple who was traveling to Cape Town."

David was very quick to reply and in no time we had agreed for pick-up at the apartments I was staying at, along with an outline itinerary for a private tour. We are a family of 5. We have 3 sons, one disabled and two other 'adults'.The day before the tour, David contacted me as the weather forecast wasn't good for the day of the trip, and offered to reschedule for a day or so later, when the weather may be better. Whilst appreciated, we had other arrangements and needed to keep with the original date.We were picked up by our driver and guide, Karen, and we again agreed loosely what we wanted to do and where we wanted to go. Of course, no-one controls the weather, and it was pretty awful from 11ish onwards. So, as we were driving, Karen made suggestions of other things which we could do, which were really good. For example, we visited an ostrich farm and had a moment feeding them. We managed to prevent the big birds from eating our hands!We made it to Cape Colony and the lighthouse in the dry and agreed with Karen that we would walk from the lighthouse to the Cape of Good Hope where she would pick us up. When at the top of the hill at the lighthouse, the heavens really opened. We travelled back down on the funicular wondering what we would do about the walk and the rain, but then saw that Karen had waited as she thought the weather looked a lot like rain. What a relief!We went on and had lunch in a really nice restaurant on the sea front and then wanted to go on to see the penguins at Boulders Beach. It was still raining really hard, so Karen drove us as close as she could to the entrance - probably closer than she should have! - so we wouldn't get too wet. Fortunately, the weather eased up enough for us to see the penguins.We next agreed to change a visit to the gardens to a visit to a vineyard, which I was very happy about, and Karen obviously knew the staff there and arranged for us to have a special extra treat which was otherwise not available as a tasting.It also has to be said that Karen was good at informing us about where we were going, what we were looking at, some of the history of the areas we visited, and was very friendly and approachable regarding questions we had.So a great day. Did the weather spoil it? Well, it tried but when you travel somewhere in their winter/wet season, you have to be prepared. Did the tour deliver? Yes, absolutely. Karen went above and beyond to make sure it did.And the key question - would we use African Blue Tours again? Absolutely right we would!"

We liked that he involved us in deciding where to go each day. You have basic itineraries for each tour but he made sure we saw everything we wanted to see. One of our tours was of the Langa Township which I would encourage everyone to take. It's great to see the beautiful scenery of the Cape but you must experience all sides of the culture. Our guide was a local gentleman that showed us the positive and uplifting parts of the townships well as their challenges. We paid a bit extra to have the private tour. It's well worth it! The van you travel in is very comfortable and has large windows. We saw other tour groups with tons of people in them and we were so glad we had a guide all to ourselves! The owner is very conscientious and wants to make sure all your needs are met. I'm looking forward to using them again the next time I'm in Cape Town"

From the very start, we knew we were onto a winner as the owner, David, took one look at my misguided clothing choices and promptly lent me his African Blue jacket for the tour to prevent me freezing throughout the day! Our guide, Duncan, was friendly and clearly knew Cape Town really well. He was constantly advising us of the key historic points relating to each of the city's attractions and was always volunteering to take photos of us for our scrapbook. Highlights of the tour had to be Boulders Beach for the penguins, Hout Bay for the seal colony boat trip, complete with eccentric locals feeding the seals at the dock, through to the climb to the lighthouse at the top of Cape Point. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend African Blue Day Tours to anyone visiting the city, and want to thank Duncan and David for their hospitality, knowledge and friendliness. Well done boys!"

We learned a lot of history of the area, saw and learned about many of the communities right outside of Capetown, had lunch at the Cape and saw the penguins. Everything was well planned and executed.

David was our tour guide and picked us up from the hotel (myself and my 3 kids ages 6, 8 and 10). We visited the District 6 museum and learned a bit of the history of the area. Then we met up with a resident of the Langa Township who took us on a walking tour. This was incredible, eye opening, fabulous...once in a lifetime. My kids are still talking about it. Absolutely a MUST for everyone. I was a little concerned before we went about safety but as I quickly learned the township is incredibly safe, the people are very warm and inviting and our guide made us feel right at home, even teaching us some words in the local language so we could better greet the people. We visited several different types of houses there and is was incredibly impactful. I think this is a MUST do for a trip to Capetown."

I had the pleasure of traveling with African Blue in April 2016 for 5 days- 1 day Peninsula Tour and 4 day Garden Route Tour.All my email queries were dutifully and promptly answered by David giving me peace of mind whilst planning the trip. During the trip, Duncan (our guide) impressed us with his attention to detail, willingness to go the extra mile, his knowledge, and his eagerness to pick up new knowledge and experiences. He even soldiered on through a bout of gastroenteritis which we both picked up from a restaurant. We really appreciated Duncan's careful driving, given the long distances we covered during this trip. All in, a great experience with African Blue. Highly Recommended!"

We booked a private Cape Peninsula tour and private transport to the Aquila safari. Based on the weather David switched the tours so we would have the best possible weather on the Cape tour - turned out perfectly. Duncan was an excellent guide - friendly and informative yet didn't feel the need to talk the whole time which I appreciated. He offered suggestions along the way that we could decide what to do: extra wine tour stop on the way back from the Safari, making lunch reservations for us at Cape Point. Highly recommend this company!"

He added a few personal favorite stops and routes that we wouldn't have gotten to see with another tour. The stop at Llandudno Beach was especially enjoyable. Matthew even helped move along the chaotic photo line at the Cape of Good Hope. He also told good stories about the history of the South Africa and the current state of affairs. African Blue also offers wine tours. Matthew would have been a great host for that too, but we'd already put a deposit down with another company by the time we found this out. Perhaps next time!"

From the planning stages to our stay in Cape Town the service could not be faulted, even helping us do a shopping trip when we first arrived! We were met by David and Matt at the airport in Cape Town and were lucky enough to have Matt for the rest of our tours and travel. His knowledge and passion for the area and South Africa was amazing and he was so keen we see everything possible in our short time in Cape Town. They thought of absolutely everything, even bringing a car to the airport purely for our luggage!The Shark Diving was such an incredible experience, seeing a total of 5-6 different sharks. I would advise to definitely take sea sickness tablets, even if not normally seasick! Although you definitely feel better when in the cage...with your mind on other things!The Cape Duet Tour was also incredible, although obviously a lot to do in a day we fitted everything in, including a lovely lunch in Simons Town.I would recommend African Blue Tours to everyone and will definitely use them again when we return!"

Matthew was our guide, a really friendly knowledgeable guy who was clearly very experienced and knew how best to avoid the crowds on the busiest day of the year. We then followed this up with a day trip to one of the safari reserves, which David transferred us to and from himself - an unforgettable experience and a great introduction for anyone wondering if they would like a safari or not... this will definitely make your mind up for you. It was great to chat to David on the drive there and back and find out lots about the culture and history of the region and the future of tourism in the region. Finally, David arranged a shark dive experience for us which was something I will never forget. This is arranged through an external company that David deals with, but the day was perfect. All three experiences were magical and I couldn't recommend David and his team enough. Even if you are not sure what you would like to do in Cape Town (or other parts of the country) i'd recommend getting in touch. David clearly knows both the country and the tourism industry inside out and i'd trust him to plan the vacation for you."

He really added to the whole tour with his knowledge of the places we went, the history, and even gave us tips on a few of his hidden local gems you won't find in any of the guide books/sites (like going to Llandudno beach instead of some of the other tourist traps). He picked us up at 930a (we're late risers) and we headed down. He was willing to stop along the way for us to take pictures and knew when to push us along when we were spending too much time in one place. We need that some times.Warning - if traveling to Cape Town in general, but specifically Cape Point during the summer seasons, it WILL be windy. We're from the U.S. so we think Chicago is \"the windy city\" but Cape Town brings it to a whole new level. My wife and I agree we've never in our lives experienced anything like it. So be prepared, and don't wear lose fitting sunglasses or hats because they'll be gone before you know it. We stopped at the old and new lighthouses at Cape of Good Hope (previously \"Cape of Storms\" which is more accurate given the wind) and be sure to walk up the hill instead of the cable car because there are additional spots along the way to take pictures you won't get via the cable car. And exercise never hurt anybody :)We saw a fire along the way which have been happening at higher rates because of the drought so our drive went on a bit of a detour but we were fine with it. We stopped to visit the penguins (one of the windiest spots so wear long sleeves even if it's hot if you want to avoid getting pelted by the sand). The R65 per Adult admission was a bit high for a few minutes of looking at penguins, you basically pay that much to get good close up pictures. And on the way back, stopping at Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens is an absolute must! We could've spent all day there. Amazing foliage and views of the mountainside one way, and the city and beaches the other. All in all, a wonderful day. Thanks Matthew!"

Highlights were the penguins at Boulders Bay, relaxed lunch at Simon's Town, and Cape Point.Although the trip was enjoyable, there were a few things that could have been improved: the vehicle's suspension was poor and air con unit's generator pumped out warm air, rendering it useless. We opened a window so no big deal, but I'd have preferred air con to wind blowing in my face. Also, instructions to other members of our group were seemingly either unclear or not adhered to, so we ended up having lunch after 3pm. Again no big deal for us but you expect things on such a packed trip to run like clockwork and have lunch earlier than 3pm.A good trip and hopefully the few negatives can be improved for others in future."

I think that if he is the standard of Davids guides then ABT will be the tour of choice as he was excellent - the vehicle clean and plenty of water - the choice of restaurant was fantastic and he was so flexible - no set agenda just a damn good guide....We were relaxed at the end of the day and had so many great pictures that a very inquisitive 9 year old took full advantage of the knowledge on display!Thanks also to Hazel at ToEscapeTo for arranging!"

Lunch had been booked for us at a great restaurant and after spending some time at the bottom of the world, we were taken to stroll around the beautiful botanical gardens at Kirstenbosch. Duncan's knowledge of the history, politics, geography and nature of the Cape is extensive and we certainly learned a lot about South Africa in general and the Cape area in particular. It was a wonderful day and I would thoroughly recommend African Blue."

He never once sounded rehearsed although I can imagine how many times he must have repeated the same lines to countless tourists. He was very accommodating and never made us feel rushed. Matthew also pre-booked our lunch at a very nice restaurant (Bertha's) in Simon's Town. We felt like a friend was showing us around rather than a typical tour guide. I would strongly recommend this tour company and especially Matthew to anyone looking to have a fun and relaxed day as well as learning a lot about Cape Town and Cape Peninsula region.

Had a super time and were able to see lions, rhinos, zebras, elephants, springboks up close! Our three hour safari was perfect for us as we did not want to do an overnight or multiple night safari. After lunch at Aquila, Matthew drove us to two wine farms, Warwick and Muratie, each very nice, and very different from each other. We did tastings at both and enjoyed the drive through the Stellenbosch area. Saw several baboons sitting on the guard rail of the road, watching us pass by! Matthew is a very fun guy, a safe driver and incredibly knowledgeable. Throughout the ride he pointed out sites of interest and enlightened us with his knowledge of South Africa, its history, culture and current events. Thank you, Matthew, for a terrific day!

Mathew took us to many wonderful places including several vineyards of varying types, a beautiful lunch overlooking a valley of vineyards, and a couple of small towns where we could buy gifts for back home. While there was so much to see and do, Mathew never had us in a rush and we always seem to have more time.

Payment was easily settled online via credit card. It was our first trip to Cape Town (except for one) and we were very much impressed with the general service standards in the city\u2019s tourism industry. This is very much so in the case of African Blue and the lodge we stayed (that\u2019s another story). We opted for the scheduled full day Cape Peninsula on Day 1 and a private Table mountain /City/ Kirstenbosch private tour on Day 2. Duncan, our guide for both days, was excellent. He was patient, professional and very knowledgeable in the areas of history, geography and nature. Places we visited offered both magnificent views & enriching experiences. Thanks again, Duncan, for the well conducted tours, the exciting ride up to Signal Hill to catch the noon gun and the beautiful sunset captured during the scenic ride back to Cape Town Central from Kirstenbosch. Kudos to David, who, having checked the weather forecasts, took the initiative and efforts (by mail & phone) to contact us to swap the date for our private tour from Wed to Tue to avoid missing the Table Mountain given the rainy forecast for Wed. Proven to be a wise decision and we were blessed with beautiful sunshine. If you are searching for a tour operator in Cape Town, look no further! On a side note, I would recommend to devote a full day to enjoy the sights and sounds of Table Mountain.  "

David was more than happy to move our originally scheduled Wednesday tour to Monday to help us and the other tour guide out.We were picked up on time by Matthew, bright and early. We first headed off to the remains of District 6. Along the way, he explained the history of the area. Our visit to the District 6 museum afterwards really brought our experience at the actual site there to life and gave us a clearer perspective.When we arrived in Langa, we had a brief tour of the visitor center. Once our guide Odwa arrived, we started a walking tour. Odwa would walk and explain certain areas to us. Then we would hop in the van and head off to different areas of Langa for more sights and information. Odwa was fantastic! We were not apprehensive about visiting a township, but Odwa made it so welcoming and safe. At the end of our day with African Blue, Matthew dropped us off at the Waterfront to catch our ferry to Robben Island. He gave us great directions where to board the ferry, and after he parked, he met us there to make certain we made it there okay. Matthew was not as engaging as some of our other tour guides, but he did a very good job and we saw everything we were promised. Odwa made our day very memorable too. All in all, a great morning of enlightenment!"

Although the reserve cannot be compared with a 'real' safari - the reserve was fenced, and also the lions were separated from the other animals - it was nice to see all the animals such close. We also booked a City Tour, which was a little shorter than normal because we were the only two who had the trip at that day. Nevertheless, Matthew told us a lot about Cape Town and gave us a good view of the life over there. Unfortunately, the Cableway up to the Table Mountain was closed, but we drove up to the hill which still gave us a nice view over the city,"

Two very different but really fantastic days out enjoying the beautiful South African scenery and countryside outside Cape Town."

His breath of knowledge stretched way beyond the content of the tour and was much appreciated. We saw the entire cape peninsula in the 9 hours we were together but left feeling it was just the right amount of things to do and see. Both the optional seal and penguin excursions are totally worth it so take advantage of them. Overall a wonderful day of sightseeing that generated many lasting memories."

Our first stop was the Anura Winery and we sampled wines with a selection of jams and cheeses. This was a great start to the day. From there we drove to Franschhoek and were given ~ 2 hours to shop and have lunch. This was too long for me. There was a wonderful Arts & Crafts faire with some vendors selling food. I had a good lunch and shared a picnic table with a local family. The next winery was Eikehof Winery where we tasted wines outside under ancient oak trees. The owner poured the wines! We then drove to the historic & university town of Stellenbosch where we had 40 minutes to explore and shop. Unfortunately it was Saturday afternoon and many of the stores had closed. We didn't make it to the 3rd winery before they closed (Vergenoegd) but we were able to walk the grounds.

We were originally going to do the group tour but decided to upgrade to the private tour. We were so glad we did this. Our guide who was named Duncan was very good. He was very knowledgable on the Cape Town area as well as South Africa. He was polite, friendly and made the trip well worth the cost.This tour has been by far the best tour we have taken here in Cape Town. They picked us up where we were staying all the way out in Hout Bay and dropped us off at the end of the day. We got to see areas of Cape Town we would not have other wise gotten too. This trip is a little expensive but well worth the cost. I would recommend it to anyone who is visiting Cape Town. Over all excellent tour!!!!!"

We were based in Cape own for four days of which we booked 2 days of tours with this tour company. Our driver/guide was called Duncan. He was a very charming, polite and knowledgeable guy. He had a wealth of information to share and was great with our rather 'active' kids! While booking the trips I corresponded with David Smith, another helpful man who guided me when booking the day trips and catering for my familys' needs. I would definately use and recommend this company again."

We thoroughly enjoyed all three and would recommend the tours themselves and also African Blue who delivered in every aspect of the process. Bookings and confirmations were efficiently processed, tours began on time and met our expectations, the tour guides were excellent, enabling flexibility within the structure of the visits and really bringing the places alive. Our appreciation and understanding of this wonderful country was enhanced immeasurably and African Blue have helped to provide us with some of the best memories of our holiday."

My husband and I and two friends spent an interesting and thoughtful day visiting District Six, the township of Langa, and Robben Island. Our guide was Thabiso, who was friendly and knowledgeable, and answered all of our questions. He started our tour by driving to the heart of District Six, where he stopped and gave us an overview of what happened there before taking us to the museum. After visiting District Six and Langa in the morning, Thabiso dropped us off at the harbor, and showed us where to catch the ferry for Robben Island and where to have lunch. We had a marvelous day despite the depressing aspects of the different sites, which are very much worth experiencing and provide unique perspectives on some of the darker moments in South Africa's history."

From the initial email conversations with David, I had such a great experience as David ensured to answer all of my numerous questions about the various tours of Cape Town. I was a solo traveler from the States with limited travel days, so I ended up going with the Cape Peninsula tour. It was fantastic and I had such a wonderful time. Matthew was the tour operator/driver that day. He was very knowledgeable and very friendly and ensured that we had a great tour experience. I got to see everything on this tour: from the penguins at Boulders Beach, to the lighthouse, to taking pictures at Cape Point, it was such a wonderful and unforgettable experience! I plan to visit Cape Town again next year, and when I do, I will definitely be reaching out to African Blue Tours again. Thank you so much David and Matthew!"

It was our fist time to Cape Town, and we were celebrating our honeymoon\u2014so we ended up going with a full-day private tour and loved the more personalized experience. Duncan was super knowledgable about everything, and had a particularly good eye for spotting wildlife. And he was really fun to spend the day with, too! He knew lots of little side stories and anecdotes about each place we went, and was really nice about stopping for pictures and taking photos of my husband and I in each place. Since we did the private tour we were able to spend a little extra time in the areas that most interested us\u2014like swimming with the penguins at Boulder beach! Definitely a highlight of the day! Duncan shared a lot of fun local facts and recommendations that we used the rest of our time in Cape Town, too. Would absolutely recommend African Blue for a really thorough and fun way to see ALOT of the Cape in just one day! It was awesome!"

We did the Township Tour - an absolute must, Robben Island and a half day in the wine country. It was comforting to know that we had arranged all this with David before we left home.Our guide for the Township Tour was a native of Langa Township. His name was Ludumo Dwaha and he was just fantastic! He gave us such and insight and you could tell how easily he was connecting with the people who invited us into their homes and kindergarten, He also gave us great demos of the click sounds in the Xhosa language. Ludumo came to our hotel in a timely fashion and we had a great morning. If there is one tour that one must book in Capetown, this is the one! Ludumo also had our Robben Island tickets for the afternoon and showed us where to get the boat. Robben Island was very interesting but if you have a weak stomach, avoid the boat.It is still very important to see if you can get there.The next day we did a half day tour of Stellenbosch and the wine country with none other than David himself and his lovely wife, Michelle, who went to the university in Stellenbosch.The town was quaint and Michelle filled us in on the university.We are not wine drinkers at all but it was worth it to see the beautiful vineyards and landscapes. We did appreciate that David took us to a very unique and beautiful winery calledMuratie and if you love wine, you must go there.I highly recommend African Blue Tours for your next trip to Capetown."

From the moment I first inquired about the excursion, David was great to work with. He was quick to respond to any of my questions which made me very comfortable about booking with him. The tour itself was eye-opening and inspiring. David and Matthew picked us up at our accommodation (they ran a few minutes late due to a traffic stop). David was a great guide and very informative as we drove to the township. He was able to give us insight into what it was like to grow up 'privileged' during the Apartheid era before we got to the township. David then left us in the very good and capable hands of Odwa, a resident of Langa. Odwa was a fantastic guide and gave us a great tour of the township. It's difficult to put into words all that was seen and experienced, so suffice it to say, i would highly recommend this tour.After the township tour ended, David picked us up and brought us to the waterfront to catch the ferry to Robben Island. There was a bit of a hassle getting onto the ferry, but there is nothing David could have done about it. We had tickets for the 1pm crossing, but due to overselling and the lateness of the returning ferry, the 1pm ferry was full so we didn't board the next ferry until almost 2. Something to keep in mind if you have time constraints.The Robben Island tour itself was remarkable. The bus ride around the island for an orientation was pleasant. The bus guide did a good job of explaining what life was like around the island. However, it wasn't until we got to the prison and met Derek that the visit came to life. Derek was a political prisoner on the island in the late 80s until his release when all political prisoners were let go. His first-hand account of the treatment and conditions really brought the tour alive.David did an outstanding job putting together this tour for us so i can highly recommend his company as one to book with."

He is also knowledgeable about local history, geography, plants and wildlife. There was so much information that I ended up taking notes on my phone to be sure and remember it. We were lucky with animal sightings (ostrich, baboon, and of course the wonderful penguins!) I recommend the Peninsula Tour very highly, and would definitely take another tour with African Blue if I had more time here. Also - the fee was very reasonable for a full day's excursion.

We had arrived by cruise ship and were late docking so, with military precision and a casual, yet efficient manner, he made sure we got there in time.He guided us around Cape Town and Table Mountain. I like his style. He gives you enough information and enough time to yourself. Some guides just keep talking and nothing sinks in. He has a healthy balance.A few days later, he collected us in Franschhoek and guided us for 5 days to various destinations and attractions on the \"Garden Route\".Throughout this time, David had to deal with varying numbers of Aussies as some joined different parts of the activities. In total, there were 14 people.All-in-all, a big \"thank you\". We thoroughly enjoyed every moment."

Weather indicated there would be rough tides and everything looked like all things wouldnt happen. David did such a good job with arranging all activities associated with the tour. He was very engaged (even before we reached to SA) and kept us abreast to all matters that had to do with the dive. Even after our orginal tour was cancelled he made a special effort to arrange another tour for us. Trust me when i say, you will be well taken care of. He is very knowledgable of the area and the history and you will not be short changed. Highly recommended!!"

My cohorts, a gentleman from Austria and one from Germany, were great company and we all agreed to let David choose. He did a fantastic job...Fairview, Solms Delta and Tokara did not disappoint in experience, views or taste. Our lunch stop in Franchoek was a delightful break. The next day, I embarked on a day trip with David to see the Cape Peninsula. This time I was accompanied by two American ladies who were a blast! Every stop was worthwhile, and David even allowed us a couple of extra stops on the way by request. He even steered us away from experiences he deemed \"too touristy\" and encouraged to have the better experience. This is no cookie cutter tour. He was a marvelous guide and it was absolutely safe and fun for a woman traveling alone. I highly recommend anyone traveling in the area to contact African Blue Tours. They are exceptional!"

The tour, however, was great, and David (of African Blue) was very helpful. So this review is mostly a review of David and African Blue.We were on our honeymoon and while we were on our own on safari and in Cape Town, we were looking for a Garden route group tour for a few days in the middle of our trip. We booked a great 4 day tour with David, who also helped to arrange our hotel in Cape Town. As i mentioned our tour was great, but David had it provided by a different operator. When we arrived in Cape Town after the tour, there was a problem with the room that the hotel wouldnt fix, so as a last resort, we called David to help us sort it out. He actually came over at 9pm and convinced the hotel to give us a new room for the night, and to fix the problem the next day. What a great advocate!We also booked a private wine tour with David, but my wife was sick that morning so we ended up on a tour of a doctor's office instead. David helped us sort things out, and we booked a second day with him so we could ultimately do our wine tour as planned.In sum, we can't really comment on the quality of the garden route tour, because ours ended up operated by another company. But it was a fantastic tour nonetheless! I can comment on how great David was with the booking process, and how great an advocate he was when we were in South Africa."

Skip ALL OF THIS, and hire David.David guided my group of 10 through wine country on a 3-stop day trip and it was the most comprehensive day on our South African holiday. I highly recommend hiring a small, local company like African Blue Tours because you get an authentic local's perspective of the area. Aside from showing up on time, providing great, comfortable transportation, the conversations we had with him gave amazing insight into the politics, culture, and geography of South Africa. Had I known better, I would have skipped all the research, worry, and planning and just had David take us to his favorite spots.

David was recommended to us and we were all certainly glad he was! Aside from the standard stuff, like showing up on time, having a nice van for transportation, and being generally knowledgeable about what he was doing- David was just a hell of a nice guy. We invited him to join us for our group lunch and he spent the meal acquainting us with the surfing ilfestyle of South Africa (another one of his passions). Aside from it being super interesting, you could tell he was just a genuinely good person. The wine tour itself was great, he selected 3 wineries for us that all had attentive staffs and amazing wines. It was a top notch day all around.I'm very happy to write this review for him and support his business in any way I can. I'd definitely recommend him to any friends that are traveling to South Africa and anyone that is reading this review. If you book a day with David, you absolutely won't be disappointed."

A group of 10 of us hired David and African Blue Tours to take us on an all-day wine tasting excursion to Stellenbosch and Franschhoek and it was an absolute blast. David was punctual, accommodating, extremely knowledgeable (not just about wine, but about local politics, surfing and all things tourism) and just a likable person. We immediately hit it off with him and asked him to join us for a nice lunch at one of the vineyards to show our appreciation (highly recommend asking him to join you, as he's a blast to chat with).I would recommend David to anyone looking for a guided tour. My only regret is that we didn't plan more of our activities through his agency. They apparently do much much more than just wine trips. http://www.africanbluetours.com/about/As an aside, I highly recommend all three of the vineyards we visited: L\u2019Ormarins, Thelema, and Tokara (excellent restaurant for lunch). The wine at Thelema was the consensus favorite and we ended up buying numerous bottles from them.Enjoy Cape Town. We most certainly did!"

We stayed at the guest house they recommended/provided in Camps Bay and it was our favorite place anywhere to date!!! So comfortable with beautiful views of the Atlantic! Each tour they booked for us was perfect with excellent guides. We made real friendships there. We felt they treated us as family and were really invested in our experience in SA!

Our tour guide Rochelle did very well and was not only well informed about the places itself, we visited, but as well about the economical, political and cultural background connected to these sides. Everything was almost perfect. My partner Siegfried and me decided to take the backpackers en suite option, not to spare the money for the guesthouse (the price difference wasn't that big, by the way) but because we had learned from other trip advisor comments that the backpackers would be at the nicer places. Infact all backpackers were very well situated. The standard of the rooms were a little bit different. By any standards the best accommodation was near Addo national park. We stayed at a farm side in the so called \"castle\" which was more like a guesthouse room than a backpackers double room. The food we'd got was at all places memorable. Rochelle was one o the best tour guides I've ever had! The activities were the pure fun. We did the early morning tour through Addo National park where we saw not only lots of the 600 - 700 elephants they have there, but one of the only 10 Lions who live there in a space almost as big as Belgium (!). Besides that we saw Kudus, Zebras and a lot more ... Fun was also the Canopytour, the tour with canoes, the adventure in the cave adventure an last but not least the skydiving. Can't tell everything. I would travel with Earthstompers again!"

Our guide Charlene was awesome, has a superb knowledge of her country and a great sense of fun that enhanced the whole experience. Her safari game drive in our opinion was better than the early morning ranger drive!

I'm usually the leader of group trips rather than a participant, but I'm really glad I joined the Earthstompers 6-day Garden Tour for my first visit to Africa (let alone South Africa). Maybe we were lucky that the 8 of us were all so easy going and enthusiastic, but I also think our guide Rochelle contributed a lot to the upbeat energy we shared, despite being a diverse group (early 20's to mid 50's, German, American, Canadian and both French and German Swiss). Nothing was too much trouble for Rochelle, who always went the extra mile to make our trip informative, comfortable and enjoyable. While I didn't try shark diving, bungee jumping or parachuting, most of us tried and had fun on the adventure cave, the zip-lining canopy and the whale watching tours. (The shark divers among us were much enthused about that tour). The canoeing and walking in Wilderness, and the viewpoints and beaches at various spots along the coast were sublime. Lots of wildlife: in addition to whales, the penguins were delightful and the Ellies at Addo fantastic. The food was delicious (many meals included), and almost all my guesthouse rooms were very special. Buy wine at the wine tasting estate to enjoy later at dinner! My only reservation was the optional safari game ride at Addo, early in the morning. To some extent, we just weren't lucky (saw more animals later in the day with Rochelle driving through the park), but I thought the Addo driver was lack luster, reciting information in a monotone about the animals we did see. Having stayed in a private game reserve near Kruger where we had a driver and a spotter in a smaller vehicle and where we could go off road onto smaller tracks or even in the bush, I didn't think this optional activity was worthwhile. To be fair, though, if we'd seen more wildlife (the lions were elusive and the elephants were hiding out until it warmed up later), I might feel differently.But this was just one small reservation: otherwise, this was a perfect trip - despite that I nearly got stuck in the Devil's Chimney at the Cango Cave.. I would recommend coming at a warmer time of year when perhaps longer days might allow for a more leisurely pace - or at least more time on the beach at the end of the day. But truly, it's an amazing tour at anytime, and Rochelle is an absolute gem."

The package gives visitors the option to choose from different types of accommodations. We chose the one with a private toilet and bath.Rochelle, our guide, was terrific from the first minute she picked us up from our guest house in Capetown. It helped that our group of seven people meeting for the first time hit if off soon after. We were from Denmark, England, Scotland and the Philippines.Driving a distance of around 2,500km for five days, Rochelle gave us the history and bits of information about the various places we visited and passed by. Lunch was paid by us but nearly all dinners and breakfasts were part of the package. I particularly enjoyed the dinners. The tour price was just right!I would recommend for visitors to bring shampoo and soap as these are not provided by the places where we slept. Also, make sure to clarify the approximate time you would be picked up and returned to your starting point so you can book your hotel or onward flight.We had to change our flight to Johannesburg as we will miss our original schedule. Rochelle was so helpful looking for alternate flights and finding us a ride to the airport so we can catch a our new flight.Do keep an open mind and make new friends, and try out the bungee jump and tandem skydive! These were optional and we are glad we chose to do them. My videos on Youtube will be seen and enjoyed in the coming years.Thank you Rochell and Earthstompers! Arnel (Philippines) "

I did this trip in Dec 2015 with my mom & I must say as locals it was good value for money, We stayed in backpackers that were quiet cosy & food was always home-made, healthy & filling. We shared the travels with other tourists who were amazing even though we were different age groups. I did various activities, we did so many fun stuff in one day & it was busy,busy. Rochelle our guide was awesome taking our suitcases & seeing to us, getting us on time & coordinating, making us comfortable. The tour itinerary was well written, we did exactly as it said. The last night the backpackers was full they put us in a B&B which was lovely accommodation. Their fish dinner was awesome & so were their breakfast it was a nice way to end the holiday. The Germany couple with us even got married on Sedgefield beach. Thank you for a great organized trip, I know my review is late but I often think of this trip."

Our tourguide Rochelle was very good, she could answer all our questions, and she made sure you feel at ease at all times. She made sure there was a good vibe in the group, she had a great sence of humour. Off course you have to be lucky with the people in the group as well, everyone in our group was enthusiastic and active. I am 33 years old and I was single traveler for that week. Earthstompers have chosen very nice accomodation and restaurants as well. For me the right combination of doing an active tour and chill in the evening. I would definitely book again with Earthstompers!"

I would happily have stayed there. The meals which are included are delicious and very much appealed to the foodies in our group - also authentically SA.I would recommend all of the activities especially the canoeing/hiking (included) and our group did a mixture of the extra activities. All were superb.Our guide (Rochelle) went above and beyond. She was knowledgable, cheerful, caring and very very hardworking. She made sure everyone in the group was happy and well informed throughout. She really turned a wonderful trip into an unforgettable holiday of a lifetime. She has an expert knowledge of her country and the Garden Route and is proud to be an ambassador to visitors.I cannot recommend this trip more highly."

We would spend all day together so it was fun getting to know other people from different parts of the world. My girlfriends and I stayed at the most adorable guest houses and the rest of the girls stayed at the backpackers option. For dinner we would all eat together at the different backpackers facility which was great!!! Either sleeping accommodation is great. Everyone we interacted with was so incredibly nice and helpful. I only wish South Africa was closer to the US so I could return sooner! I highly recommend this trip if it's your first time in South Africa and beginning your trip in Cape Town. You will see and do a lot and meet great people. I also recommend for someone traveling alone too."

Mostly between age 21-37, so definately for the young generation.I have to say the tour was a lot about 'rush rush' and not having a lot of free time. Yes we traveled 2000km in those 6 days but could not enjoy a few moments by ourselves.It was a lot about waiting for other people, people forgetting things, people wanting extra things which went on the costs of others. Also do not under estimate the time being spent driving on the road as it as A LOT - every day.We saw a lot and had fun times that's for sure. Enjoyed the ostrich farm, ziplining, sandboarding, Addo Park etc You could also go bungy jumping or skydiving.. I stayed in the single en-ensuite Hostels and was positively surprised about the rather high standard. Dinner was always delicious too (just note that for guesthouse people dinner is always being served in the hostels).I made some good friends too on this trip :-)"

They needed a scrub bucket and some bleach and get in that shower which is where it was the nastiest and scrub that place down. As for the unsafe there were no locks on the doors and no lockers for your stuff so i didnt like that much.

I was worried when I booked it about feeling ill as I get travel sick, don't let this put you off as you have regular stops and the roads are usually long and straight so I didn't feel ill once. Definitely worth booking!"

We were able to do so many great excursions and i had a life changing experience. Doing the bungee jump was by far my favourite day and i would highly recommend. As a single traveller i stayed in the backpackers accommodation. Everywhere we stayed was very clean and the evening meals were exceptional. I think it was much more fun staying at the backpackers as you get involved with everything. Peter went out of his way to make sure everyone got to do the excursions we wanted and you were provided with lots of options each day. The bus journey was good and always had appropriate rest stops along the way. The beginning of the Garden Route tour is absolute breathtaking and has spectacular views. 100% if you get offered the change of Shark Diving DO THIS! Its amazing to see these animals. Thanks very much for a great time :) Rachel"

Our guide Charlene was very patient, informative, friendly and really helpful. There were 2 minibuses, so 2 guides and Cindy other guide was equally helpful. Nothing is too much trouble. The itinerary was a great way to see the garden route and the added bonus Addo elephant park. A good mix between trying different food, wine tasting, buying the best gin in the world, some walking, canoeing & swimming. Definitely recommend. They also do optional activities but don't push them if you don't want to do them. Thank you so much we have had a great insight to South Africa & look forward to the food & wine tours."

From the moment we were picked up, Rochelle went above and beyond her role to look after us, get to know us, share her passion and love for the country, and make our Christmas unforgettable! Each day had a well thought out and planned itinerary which allowed us to see and experience as much of the beautiful country on the route as possible. It was certainly an active tour and I particularly enjoyed the gentle canoe followed by a tranquil le walk to a waterfall for lunch in Wilderness; it was easy to understand why Rochelle loves her job so much with all the stunning places to see!The transport was very comfortable, modern and ideal for a road trip. The accommodation always had a great atmosphere and the dinners and breakfasts were all superb! Waking up early Christmas Day and heading out to see lions, elephants, buffalo, zebra, warthogs, ostriches... in Addo was a real highlight as was the magnificent accommodation on Christmas Eve; a little slice of paradise.This was a truly unforgettable trip and I would definitely go on it again! Thank you, Earthstompers, especially Rochelle who made our Christmas so wonderful!"

The garden route is stunning and we were lucky enough to have nice weather throughout our trip and even luckier to have such an amazing guide in Charlene, she was very knowledgable and even went out of her way to retrieve my partner's IPad when he left it at hostel.

She made the trip extra special and knew so much about everything we encountered. Even with the extra activities, the itinerary was excellent value for money without comprising in quality. The backpackers we stayed in were all of a high standard and made some incredible food. Be warned though, the trip is intense with activities and does have some long driving - unavoidable unfortunately but the journey is beautiful and you get to see all the best bits of the garden route as a result. The safari extension, although expensive (most safaris are) was worth the money. It was a unique experience staying in Amakhala in a tent and definitely a highlight.

With guide Rochelle I immediately knew I'd made the right choice and our disparate group of four from 18 to never mind had such fun and will remain a highlight of my African trip. I'd upgraded to en suite rooms which were well worth it. Don't expect hairdryers, great lighting or good powerpoints but be amazed at how liberating a new attitude to travel and adventure can be. The tour exceeded all my expectations and thank you again to Rochelle who helped make it possible for me to accept a job offer back home which made my holiday.

Next, Steph was funny, warm, and very informative -I learned a lot about the flora and fauna of South Africa. The adventure part of my trip was doing the 90 minute Cango Cave adventure route which involves going through very claustrophobic spaces!

She is absolutely a wonderful person and I'm so happy I got the chance to do the tour with her. She knows a lot about the area and did her best to give everyone the best experience as possible. We have done some amazing things (bungee jumping) and we always stayed in very nice and cozy backpackers. The diners were absolutely mind blowingly jummie and most of the time really typical South African, which I really liked (we ate for example ostrich meat, did a nice braai and ate potje). Unfortunately my dorm was broken into and me, my friend and a girl from the group were robbed from our camera's and money. We lost all of our pictures and this was of course a very sad experience. Everyone (the company, the owners of the farm where we stayed and Charlene) were very shocked, because it has never happened before on a tour. Even though I had the feeling my entire holiday was ruined, Charlene managed to make me smile and enjoy myself again (and I'm very thankful for that). Earthstompers sent us a heartwarming email and we were taken to diner to a very nice restaurant, where we had an amazing night. We can't get our pictures back, but my memories will always remain and I will definitely remember how well I was taken care of in the sad circumstances.

I had a great tour with an affordable price and packed with great activities including hiking, canoeing, wine tasting, a safari in Addo, and scenic views every day. Our tour guide really made the trip even better than it already was, and was also very knowledgeable about anything that we had to ask. One thing to note about this tour is that some activities that are really worth doing are not included in the price, such as shark cage diving, bungee jumping, an extra early morning game drive, sand boarding, skydiving, zip-lining, etc."

First of all I should say that this tour offers unbelievable value for money but can be easily adapted to suit your budget and preferences. We choose to stay at backpackers but upgraded to private en-suite and were really impressed at what we got. The tour is really well thought out and followed the itinerary but our guide (Pieter) was really happy to adapt things to suit peoples wishes. The food provided is of a very good standard and you get to try many local dishes. Food and drink in South Africa are of a very good quality and along the route there is plenty of opportunity to sample so much! The activities built into the tour gave an excellent flavour of everything we wanted to do along the Garden Route and for us the tour took away the hassle of organising things ourselves. If you are looking for a great value Garden Route tour that wont break the bank but still exceeds expectations - this is the one for you."

Our guides Rochelle and Charlene were exceptionally friendly and helpful. We opted for the Backpackers' accommodations and felt much more a part of the evening fun, as the dinners take place at the backpackers' lodges, not the more luxurious accommodations (which are often a bit further away). We strongly advise signing up for as many optional programs as possible: it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do the \"special\" cave tour, sky-dive or bungee-jump! The company is well managed and the itineraries well planned."

I had taught a class about the culture and history of South Africa. Earthstompers accommodated all the museums and historical spots I wanted to include, besides making this journey beautiful and an emotional journey through history. We saw wildlife galore, gorgeous coast, mountains, caves, had spectacular food, a drumming circle on the beach, and got to visit Townships where we met real people, real teachers, and saw real life as well as all the tourist must-see spots. We feel as if we lived South Africa instead of just sight-seeing. Every student wants to return. The variety of accommodations were all comfortable and what we hoped for. Earthstompers did all this within the budget I gave them. They are AMAZING! I'd recommend them to the end of the earth. They only hire knowledgeable, wonderful guides. I'll use them again, absolutely!"

Adventure in Cango Caves and Tsitsikammma Park, beautiful sights on the road, on the water (WIldernis canoeing) and on many stops. Overwhelming nature and wildlife. the Addo nature park drive is superb (the early morning one was cold and very foggy but we saw the buffalo - and I saw a female lion though I can't prove with a picture ...), we saw hundreds of elephants and many other animals. The group dinners were very good and the accommodation (we were in guesthouses) beyond imagination. Last but not least - Charlene and Rochelle (first day) are excellent professionals who made us feel comfortable and taught us so much about SA, we'd never have been able to find out for ourselves.

The thought and professionalism that went into planning this amazing and reasonably-priced tour to include a wide range of experiences that would appeal to people of all ages from around the world was evident. Our friendly tour leader, safe driver and wonderful guide Stephanie has a wide breadth and depth of knowledge about all things South Africa and Africa that she was more than willing to share and went the extra mile to insure that each of the five special and friendly people on our tour had a memorable and wonderful time. For example, I had mentioned that I liked sweeter wines; and she asked the people at the winery to give me samples of sweeter wines to taste. She also dropped me off at a delightful museum while the rest of my group (half my age) went sky diving. Traveling in a comfortable air-conditioned bus, we saw stunning scenery, beautiful beaches, waterfalls, rugged mountain peaks and passes, rivers and river gorges, fields, flowers, thickets, and forests. We sampled delicious local wines and local food, including babootie, malva, and braii, visited a farmer's market, and stayed at comfortable, clean lodgings. We visited the southern most tip of Africa and saw wildlife galore from African penguins (Betties Bay), baboons, and ostriches (Oudtshoorn) to elephants, zebras, hyenas, jackals, and a black maned Kalahari lion at Addo Elephant National Park. We canoed, hiked, explored caves, and had the opportunity to swim with sharks, bungee jump off the highest bridge in the world, sky dive, and take a canopy tour via zip line. It was a terrific tour; and I can recommend taking the Garden Route Tour or any forthcoming tour from Earthstompers without any hesitation."

I was also lucky to share the tour with a good group of travellers (11 others in total) - couldn't have asked for a better bunch.The itinerary is packed - it's the perfect way to experience some of the beauty of South Africa if you're pressed for time, as I was. Activities can be tailored to your preference, with plenty on offer for adrenalin junkies. Be aware that the tour is fast-paced, and a significant amount of time is spent in the van (to cover all that distance). I would also recommend taking the option of a private room at the hostels, rather than the dorm.Overall, the trip was incredibly fun.

Sometimes you have to choose between suggested activities, no time to do them all, but was ok for me as I did not wantto do everything anyway. The Backpackers where we stayed were phantastic and very comfortable. Sometimes situated just above the beach and once we stayed in a wonderful lodge which was an orange farm too. Amazing trip and lasting memories! Thank you!"

We were a bit skeptical about taking a 6 day tour in a van - lots of driving, unknown co-travellers, etc. We were very pleasantly surprised and had a great time with Earthstompers and our guide Stephanie. The whole trip was well organized, we got to see so many things that it would be difficult to see if you were on your own and we always had a great guide with us \u2013 explaining everything to us along the way. The 6-day Garden Route and Addo trip does entail a lot of driving but we made many stops along the way and Stephanie was always a great driver as well as a fantastic guide. All of the guesthouses along the route were of very high quality and service was always at its best. Many optional activities provided \u2013 don\u2019t miss out on the skydiving \u2013 pure adrenalin boost! Even some South Africans we met in Cape Town after the tour were amazed how much we saw in so little time. Highly recommended and thanks again to Stephanie for the great trip!"

We all made such good friends on the tour and charlene made sure we all did what we wanted to do making sure we got everywhere on time.The best activities was the Conagoe caves (adventure tour - although not if you are claustrophobic) , canoeing and the safari were also awesome! The wine tour was great and I really enjoyed the Sandboarding. The only thing I didn't enjoy is the Ostrich farm, its good fun except for when people try to ride them, they have to catch the ostrich by the neck and then hood them, its just unkind. The beaches we went to were beautiful and Titskamma is really beautiful. The canopy zip-lining was also great fun. It was just non stop gogogo (but you can catch up on sleep in the bus). You could also do whale watching, Elephant sanctuary and shark cage diving which they add onto the tour if you want to :)We stayed in the Backpackers which I strongly recommend over the guest houses. Every single back packers we stayed at had the best atmosphere, all very friendly, clean and comfortable. Also, the tour always ate at the back packers, I think people staying in the guest houses got annoyed that they had to get driven home every night after dinner rather than staying on and drinking. You do not have to stay in a dorm (although we did) you can ask for private rooms. I went with my friend but we also had to honeymoon couples on our tour who I know loved every minute of it also :)Earthstompers sort everything out for you so all you have to do is enjoy yourself :)Chloe"

Charlene was such a knowledgeable and friendly guide, and went out of her way to make sure everyone had a fun, safe experience. As a solo traveller, I was slightly concerned about joining a group where I didn't know anyone, but as there were only 7 people in total we gelled instantly, and I made friends from a diverse selection of countries including Singapore, Switzerland and Germany. The scenery on the Garden Route is spectacular, and the mix of activities Earthstompers include caters for everyone, from canoeing to bungee jumping and everything in between. All the backpackers we stayed in were clean and comfortable, and we had some delicious braai in the evenings. There is a lot packed in to this tour, so the pace may not suit everyone, but it is great value for money, with attentive guides and some of the most breathtaking countryside you will ever witness. I highly recommend it. And if you have the courage, do the bungee jump!"

I even had a four poster bed for my last nights stay!! From the initial pick up until the moment I was dropped off everything was well organised and efficient. The activities offered were ideal and offered a wide variety of choice for both young and old. As ever with these trips the make or break can be with your group and I was lucky to spend six days with such a great group of people....I think this tour must attract like minding individuals! One person who must get a special mention is our tour leader Stephanie. She put in so much effort to making our trip hassle free and enjoyable, she is extremely knowledgeable about all things Africa and certainly knows how to manoeuvre a Toyota mini van + trailer!! Cannot recommend highly enough, just wish more tours were on offer for my next trip to South Africa."

Every day was something new and different, our group of 12 was a great mix of interesting people, and having the option of being able to choose from multiple different options for our \"extra\" activities made it almost like a custom-designed trip. Stephanie was so knowledgeable, nice, and accommodating for all our needs. Our vacations have typically been more \"do-it-ourselves\" type affairs, but it was so nice to have someone else do all driving, have all the great lodging and much of the dining arrangements already taken care of, and not have to concern ourselves with those decisions. One of the highlights for us was all the up-close encounters with multiple kinds of wildlife during the early-morning Ranger-led wildlife viewing trip at Addo Elephant National Park. We have already highly recommended this trip to our friends."

Our ages ranged from 17 to 57 (but everyone was ageless in their interactions), and we represented five different nationalities (but everyone was able to communicate and relate as if we were all neighbors). Every where we toured and stayed was really spectacular. The only negative was that we didn't get to spend enough time at each stop. I wish we could have had a longer trip... (our fault). Hendrick was incredibly informative, accommodating, and willing to cater to our unique needs. He also did a remarkable job of offering a wide variety of activities that kept everyone entertained."

The included meals were very good, we could experience typical south african dishes and special places. The accommodations were all comfortable We stayed in the guest houses and were very satistfied with all the places.Also the activity level is fine and you can organise the tour by your own wishes with all the special trips. You just should be prepared to get up early in the morings to manage all the activities.I would defently recommend trips with earthstrompers adventures because I could have not imagined the trip being any better!"

The trip via the vast and stunning, diverse countryside was exceptional, only topped by Henrik's(our guide) soothing and educational narrative as we cruised through. The accommodation was of a really high standard for the bag packers so if you really want a luxury treat...you can go with the guest houses. We went with the private bagpackers room and found the room very clean (sometimes quite spacious/luxurious) with amazing character...often a chic bohemian style. Meals are provided for every day at the bagpackers digs and is absolutely delicious regardless of your diet. I'm fussy and was never disappointed!There are lots of adventures for thrill seekers and for those of us that are slightly faint at heart, a beer and an ocean are never too far away. A must do if time permits in Cape Town, was definitely the highlight of my visit. I must also say that Hendrik went above and beyond to ensure everyone had a good time, so there's no need to be shy for lone travellers!"

He was so much fun and ensured we all had a fabulous time. The accommodation that they picked for our group was perfect. We stayed in the most amazing farmhouse for our last night and Hendrick even arranged for the owner to cook us a traditional brie on the outdoor fire. He even bought along 4 bottles of red wine for us as a surprise!! Hendrick took us to all the best local restaurants and eateries and went out of his way to ensure our experience was the best it could be and that every little detail was covered.

Nicole, our guide, wanted to make sure everyone on the trip had a good time. She was very knowledgeable and accommodating. Therefore, if one person didn't want to do an activity she would arrange for that person to do something else - dropping them off and picking them up. E.g. some people didn't want to visit the ostrich farm and ride ostriches so she arranged to take them to an animal park in the area and pet lions. Nicole also has a sweet disposition that made the trip that much more enjoyable. We travelled quite a long distance in the bus but the ride was comfortable, conversation amiable, and the view beautiful. She also dropped me off at the airport and helped me pick up some supplies for my next trip through Botswana to Vic Falls. I would highly recommend this trip."

I opted for a hostel ensuite private room for the week and I didn't regret this for a second. We stayed in a variety of individually styled hostels.

Nicole has such a breadth of knowledge and a really good feel for the group and our likes that we really got the best out of every tour stop. We were such a varied group with ages 20s to 50s but we all got on so well which was great! I opted for the tandem skydive and the bungee jump - and I felt the organisations that ran these activities were very focused on safety and on making sure I had fun! Additionally, Nicole went out of her way to make us each feel comfortable - she accommodated my weird food dislikes and even helped arrange for me to get an \"emergency\" manicure!

Earthstompers was previously unknown to me but following several clear email exchanges with Hendrik the 10 day itinerary was sorted and we awaited collection from the first guest house in Cape Town. Our guide Erica was superb, ready at all times during the trip and full of South African knowledge on the culture, food, wine, animals and geography. The days each had their own character, be it wildlife, wine tours, sights, river canoeing or a mixture with each leaving us delighted at the end of the day with plenty to talk about over excellent food and wine (great value too!). All of the places stayed in offered all that could be wanted for cleanliness, friendliness and facilities. All of the places visited offered great value and experiences, even if 10 days is not really long enough to explore this area properly! As far as we were concerned their was nothing missing and the personal touches from Hendrik and Erica were very much appreciated. A great break with great organisation and well worth talking too. Definitely recommended to anyone wanting to do something similar. Email Hendrik now!"

We had a great group with 3 twenty somethings, a middle age person, and myself (a retiree). I was concerned that as a \"senior\" on the trip I might not fit in - but I was absolutely wrong. It was a wonderful experience, we all enjoyed the trip. I would strongly recommend the company, the tour, and the guide whether you are young or just young at heart. I will definitely be back to South Africa in the future. Thank you!"

Even if you passed your midlife crisis already and if you don\u00b4t mind to travel with youngsters half of your age, I can fully recommend this venture. This tour is well organized, the atmosphere relaxed and personal and accomodations hand-selected. Our driver and guide Stephanie was always good-humored, helpful, knowledgeable and an excellent driver. This well over 2,000 km roundtrip is a comfortable way to explore part of the coastal region of South Africa within 6 days. Pick-up from our hotel was on the minute (as all the others during the trip). While bungee-jumping and shark-diving was not the challenge we needed, we loved the alternative hiking options and strolls along lonely beaches or rocky coasts (a pair of sturdy shoes recommended; hiking boots not required). Instead of the atmospheric hostels we had chosen guesthouse accomodations, which we always found very satisfying up to really luxurious. The same applies to breakfast and dinner (on most days included; dinner was always together with the group). We were lucky with the weather, mostly warm and sunny but not really hot, at times good to wear a jacket. Sunset is already around 6.p.m. Although the days were therefore relatively short we found this time of the year with the big crowds gone and amenable temperatures the perfect time to go on such a trip and enjoyed the evenings sitting around the fireside savoring a bottle of local beer or a glass of wine. Seeing elephants, zebras and other wilds beasts (e.g. in Addo N.P.) is a very different experience than going to a zoo. All in all a very diverse, worthwhile tour with a company that fully deserves its good reputation."

            "review": "The best decision I made in SouthAfrcia. I am from Germany and wanted to see a bit of this amazing country. It was the best decision ever to go on the 6 Day Garden Route Tour! Our tourguide Steph was awesome! We had so much fun together! We were a really mixed group which I first thought could become really weird.Almost all of us came from different countries and weren't in the same age group! But in the end I made friends forever even if being 40 years apart. That is something I will never forget about this tour! Really if you are thinking of doing this tour or not, just do it! You will have such a good time! As a local Steph showed us so beautiful places you wouldn't have seen without going on this tour. The Backpackers we stayed in were great! Everyone was very special on their one way. All very clean and oooh I can't forget that! The FOOD! Yes the food was great. I am staying in Cape Town for half a year and haven't tried any local food. On this tour I had the opportnity to actually get to know this country better than I did after a few months in Cape Town! So for every type of personality there is always something to do: if you are the ADVENTURE type you can go bunjy jumping, skydiving or shark cage diving - if you are more interested in animals you can go on an Ostrich Farm tour, go to Knysna Elefant Park and actually touch the Elefants or go on an extra gamedrive in Addo Elefant Park-or if you're just the one that wants to chill you can just walk around the towns like Hermanus, Knysna and Mossel Bay, go to the woderful beaches on the way or go shopping Yay! So there is like a little something for everyone! I hope you actually just decided to go for this tour cause you won't regret it! Have a great time :)Oh yes Steph if you're reading this: Thank you for this wonderful time! I enjoyed it so much and I hope you are enjoying your Little White rabbit :) No no it's okay ;) Hope seeing you soon!!"

Our tour guide, Hendrik, was incredibly knowledgeable, professional and, most importantly, fun. He was always open to stopping for pictures, he would routinely buy us food and drinks so that we can enjoy authentic South African treats and he was constantly providing us with interesting information about the country's history. One thing to note is that much of the trip is weather permitting so, if you had bad weather like we did, you'll be spending a lot of time driving and not so much time doing. Some constructive feedback for Earthstompers in this regard is to consider finding alternative activities that may not be so affected by bad weather, such as wine tasting or various other sheltered attractions - even if these attractions may not be otherwise ideal - so that tour-goers have a bit more to do than just drive around and pout about the rain when the weather is bad. Notwithstanding, Hendrik did a great job of making things lively, wishing away the rain and keeping us entertained and having fun. I would recommend anyone to take this trip if they want to have a great time with great company."

As a local she provided us with insights to this beautiful country and looked after the group really well. Special thanks to her game drive at Addo Elephant Park, which was brilliant and the lovely picnic at the waterfall. Very special!The route was well thought out and full of highlights like Hermanus, Tsitsikamma, Addo Elephant Park and Mossel Bay. The group was a small, mixed age group and made us feel very welcome as a middle aged couple. The program is well designed for the more adventurous mind if you want to do shark cage diving or a 216m bungee jump, but you can also opt out and just relax and enjoy the scenery.We have done the tree canopy tour at Tsitsikamma, which is real fun and then I guess the highlight was the sky dive in Mossel Bay. The instructors are fabulous, very knowledgable and also very funny. It is well worth getting the video as it includes heaps of photos as well.We stayed at guest houses along the way, but now having seen the backpackers we could have easily stayed there. Brilliant locations!Earth stompers provide an exceptional service with this very well organized tour. We would like to thank Stephanie for showing us a glimpse of this beautiful country and we will be back for sure."

Each day was fabuluous and the accomodations choosen with knowledge of the nice spots, yet, still within budget e.g. hostels or b&b's You can choose which category you want to be in, the hostels are really with lots of charme and nice. Highlights of the trip were Hermanus, Tsitsikamma, Addo Elephant Park, Mossel Bay with beautiful sceneries, food and activities. Be aware that this trip gives you an insight, ideas on destinations you definitely should go back toOrganization via Earthstompers (tour guide Nicole)Earthstompers gives an exceptional service and feeling to the entire trip. Pick-up is arranged from your location within Capetown and drop-off as well. The tour includes a dedicated driver, in our case Nicole, who, with wit, charm and loving heart will give you all her positive energy and details about this beautiful country. I would like to thank Nicole for this amazing and unforgettable tour, i certainly will come back to South Africa."

One of us even booked last minute and the team managed to fit her in with no problems. Met a great bunch of people on the tour so that by the end I felt we were saying goodbye to old friends. Steph our guide and driver was an absolute treasure trove of information (Nicole who was with another group also joined us for dinner and drinks and we really enjoyed that too). I found Steph to be very informative and enthusiastic, her pride in her work and her country is evident. The highlight of the tour was the drive in Addo where we saw around 4/5 elephant herds rock up to the watering hole. The accommodation was excellent on each night as was the food. 2 of us were vegetarian and we were catered for at every dinner with a vegetarian version of the dish the meat eaters got. I really appreciated this as it helped me to get a taste of African cuisine (and I loved it). Lunch was a challenge as it wasn't always easy to get a vegetarian sandwich, however bread cheese and a juice were easily available. The optional activities were also a lot of fun and allow for a lot of flexibility. So even if you don't do any there are other things to do that are equally enjoyable. My only regret is that I did not book my Kruger trip with Earthstompers.I would recommend them to everybody, a must do if you want to see South Africa and have some fun at a reasonable price."

The van was comfortable and Nicole, our tour guide, was so conscientious and interested in making sure that everything we wanted or needed was available, it was wonderful. She really was our advocate during the trip, looking out for us, and making sure to give us all the good tips that would make the tour the best it could be. We upgraded and did not stay in the backpacker lodges, and all of the B&Bs that we stayed in were BEAUTIFUL and the breakfasts were delicious. The activities were great. The only one that we were somewhat disappointed in was the black-river tubing on the Storm's River which was more rock climbing than we anticipated. The water was very low and therefore we had less time in the water and more climbing over the boulders and the exit into the Indian Ocean was very dangerous because of the incoming tide which was super strong that day. I would not recommend this activity unless the river was higher, and you are prepared for a lot of rowing in your tubes. Again, Nicole was the BEST host we could have asked for....super knowledgeable and very interested in making our trip the best is could be. She even scheduled a massage for me the day after the river trip, which I REALLY needed. It was wonderful!"

The Garden Route seemed perfect and I was inclined to book with Earthstompers because of the great reviews I saw. This tour provided many more activities than other Garden Route trips I came across that are targeted toward college students. I chose to stay in the backpacker dorm accommodations and they were great, some locations went above and beyond what I imagined for a backpacker lodge/hostel. I believe all dinners were included except one, and those were all great meals as well. Allowed me to taste a lot of traditional South African dishes that I may not have had otherwise and they were all delicious. If you have a group that you would want to travel with this would be a great trip for you to book together. It was really a great way to see the Cape. Our guide, Nicole, was also super upbeat, friendly, and knowledgeable. She did an amazing job!All around great trip.

Nicole was hugely knowledgable, she catered for everyone's needs and added in activities as and when the group asked. She went so far above and beyond what could have been asked of her - one of our fellow traveller's camera battery died so Nicole lent her new camera to them for the duration of the trip, another traveller was yet to organise accommodation for when they got back to Cape Town so Nicole organised it for them, and another traveller wanted a map so Nicole bought one for them. She is an excellent tour guide.The itinerary is fun and packed with beautiful spots and great accommodation. We covered so much ground and saw things that will stay with me forever. This trip is priced extremely low, whatever your budget, regardless of whether you can afford something more, this is still the trip for you if you really want to see the Garden Route and get the most out of it.Thank you Nicole, wish I could do it all again!"

I feel like I am going to repeat all of these fabulous comments...But I have to because this tour deserves all the praise it can get!This 6-day, 5-night Garden Route tour had a choice between guest houses or backpackers. I was hesitant to choose backpackers, but was pleased that I could pay a bit extra and get a private room with en-suite. Perfect. On top of that, I couldn't believe there was no extra charge for being SINGLE!! No single supplement!! This is a perfect tour if you are traveling solo, as a couple, or a family. It suits all! In our tour there were two single ladies and a family of 4. This is another advantage of Earthstompers, small groups up to a max of 12 or 13. We had 6. Chrissy and Hendrick (owners) of Earthstompers were very quick in responding to emails/questions I had prior to leaving and were genuine in welcoming me on board this tour.This was my second time visiting the Garden Route. I had done it solo two years ago but wanted to see more and go further. This tour touched on a lot of highlights I missed my first time around (or had no idea even existed) and also travelled further to Addo National Elephant Park. I can honestly say I have truly visited the Garden Route thanks to Earthstompers.Pick up was on time (although I made the mistake of giving the wrong pick up hotel address)...and this is where the WoW factor began with our tour guide, Nicole. Nicole made this tour. She was flexible, understanding, knowledgeable, accommodating, and fun. She is engaging and interesting, with a wealth of knowledge and passion about her country. We had great conversations during our drives... and a lot of laughs. We have become friends and I am writing this review for that reason, that's how good it was that I know I have made a lifelong friend with Nicole in the 6 days we spent together.All the backpackers hostels had special features; steps to the beach, practically on the beach, amongst citrus groves, amazing meals, and great hosts.The itinerary was fantastic and so flexible. There was absolutely no pressure to do anything and Nicole gave her honest but objective opinions about all excursions offered and it was up to us to decide what we wanted to do. I just can't say enough about this tour, the company and Nicole. If you are looking for clean, comfortable accommodation with amazing locations, exciting and beautiful excursions and experiences, fun, relaxed, down to earth atmosphere with an enthusiastic and passionate tour guide, AND affordable, then Earthstompers is the tour for you!I promise!!"

I did kayaking, tree top ziplining, a museum and elephant feeding as well as the standard activities and tours like Addo elephant park, the Cango caves, ostrich farm and wine tasting.The standard of accommodation was better than any backpackers I have ever stayed in before- the private rooms were more like 3/4* guesthouses. The food was also way above usual backpacker fare - home cooked meals and braii and stews at the various backpackers/guesthouses.So glad I booked this tour. Well done and thanks Earthstompers!"

I have done many organised group tours, some short some long, and this was by far the best. It was brilliantly organised, the accommodation was all comfortable, clean and in superb locations and the transport and logistics were all comfortable and smooth. There's so much to do on the Garden Route and in 6 days we managed to fit the best of the Garden Route.Our tour leader, Nicole, was 2nd to none. She was friendly, knew her stuff and she even took us to some local favourites off the 'beaten track' that most tours would never go to. The group was all around the same age (average mid to late 20s) but anyone young at heart would have loved every second of tour.If you're thinking of doing the Garden Route I highly recommend doing it with Earthstompers. You definitely won't be sorry you did."

All the good things mentioned in the other reviews are true! The way, Hendrik, Chrissy, Nicole and Steph organize those 6 adventurous days is well organized, with great accommodation and a trulely rewarding itenary but with lots of flexibility, too. I was a solo traveller this time and have booked the guesthouse, which is a great option if you want to have a bit more privacy and you are already done in your life with the backpacking/ hostel thing. The guesthouses are amazing, each one is different and the hosts are all very accomodating. The hostels also looked very nice and travellers like me (or couples) could easily book a private room there as well to stay with the group. The food (dinner) was excellent as well!What makes this tour so special however are the people! Nicole is one of the most interesting people I have met with a great passion for her country, an endless patience and a flexibility that is stunning! I am amazed how Nicole \"understands\" people and makes them happy!Not sure which of the \"highlights\" to mention as I loved it all but what I will never forget is the feeling when half of the group went bungeejumping and some of us joined the bridge to encourage them and feel the vibe - goose bumps guarantee!!!Thank you Nicole for such a great time and for the surprise from back home! Thank you Hendrik for running such a great tour, that is different to what the others offer just by the way you organize it!"

So much more than sightseeing but really feeling and experiencing the beauty of the Garden Route. And Nicole is a fantastic guide. Unfortunately I had to leave the group on friday and fly back from PE to Cape Town, as I had to fly back to Belgium on saturday. But whenever I have the chance to come back to South Africa, and enjoy another tour. Earthstompers will be first choice. And I hope I can stay much longer at that time.Thanks, it was great !"

I liked that the tour had so much variety as each day was very different with new adventure. The tour also offered flexibility so you could select options to tailer the trip to your own personal preference by offering a range of optional activities and different accomodation options. Our guide Stephanie was a lot of fun and we had a great group of people to travel with. Not only was I impressed with the tour itself but we also had a lot of help from Hendrik before we arrived. He not only booked the tour for us but our accomodation and airport transfer prior to the tour and helped book our two week volunteer trip after. I would definetly recommend this trip to anyone who wants to explore the Garden Route. Great job Earthstompers and Thanks for showing us such a great time."

It was our first group tour in many years and being a mid 50's couple with a majority 30's group wasn't a problem. We have no regrets....just great memories & many new friends worldwide. Hendrik was superb, knowledgeable, funny, patient and nothing was ever too much trouble. We saw & did many more activities then would ever be possible on our own. The tour was well organized and there was something for everyone. We upgraded to the guesthouse option and were thrilled with the high quality & beautiful views from the guesthouses. Every meal was an adventure in South African cuisine and the food was superb from breakfast to braais and everything in between."

The price was very good for all the activities and most days had two meals included- the food was excellent and the accomidation was very nice as well. I preferred the private rooms and was very happy with the lodging and facilities everywhere I went.

Not only that, but Henrick went above and beyond in tracking down my luggage and getting it delivered to where we were staying three days into the trip. The places we stayed at exceeded expectations and were not what I would generally think of when booking hostels. The meals were absolutely wonderful ... I don't think that I have eaten so well on a vacation before.

South African Airways had a 2-day sale last fall so on a whim I bought tickets and then had only a couple weeks to plan our trip. Somebody had mentioned Earthstompers on one of the SA forums here, and that set our plans in motion! Booking through their website was easy, and we received a confirmation immediately as well as some additoinal forms to fill out and send back to Henrik. The entire registration process was very smooth and we found the prices ot be quite reasonable.We opted to start our tour off with the great white shark diving (awesome, by the way!) so we were picked up from our Cape Town hotel very early in the morning to head to the outfitter. We also picked up 2 other people in Cape Town, who turned out to be on our Earthstompers tour as well. It gave us some extra time to get to know each other and a fun way to begin the adventure! After shark diving, our guide Nicole and the rest of our tour group picked us up at the shark dive place. The only snag was that the little trailer attached to the van didn't quite fit everybody's luggage (many of us were ending our tour in Port Elizabeth, therefore we couldn't leave anything behind in Cape Town). With a little shuffling and shoving, and using some extra space in the van, Nicole was able to get everything in its place and get us on the road - clearly she's done this before!The itinerary was amazing and the places we stayed at were very cool. You have several choices for accommodations; most of us stayed in the hostels but one person chose the guest houses (a little nicer). Don't let the word \"hostel\" fool you though - some of the places we stayed at felt more like a comfy homestay and the accommodations were far from spartan. Every location was clean, safe, and walking distance to good restaurants and/or scenic views. And the food that some of the hostals provided was incredible!As with anything, what really makes a trip enjoyable are the people. We had an amazing tour group, 11 people (mostly from Europe) ranging from their 20's to a solo traveler in his 60's, and Nicole as our guide. Nicole did a wonderful job driving, narrating, translating, and answering our sometimes strange questions. She is wise beyond her years and also an excellent ambassador for South Africa - we came away from that trip knowing so much more about the country and its people. But most importantly, Nicole was just as much a part of the group as any of us - joining us at meals, making great recommendations on how to spend our free time, and just being an all out awesome person to hang out with. If my husband and I had planned out our own garden route tour, we never would have met such fantastic people nor learned so much aboutt his beautifuland diverse country.Thank you, Earthstompers, for making it such an easy choice for us on how to spend our precious vacation time, and introducing us to people with whom we hope to have a lifetime connection!"

On one day's notice, Earthstompers developed a sight seeing plan for the Garden Route which included stops and lodging on the Indian Ocean and wine country. We were extremely grateful for the quality of their planning and the flexibility shown as we made our way across the country. The best part was our guide, Roelf, who was superb in every respect. He was extremely knowledgeable on a broad range of subjects and was able to do complex planning on the fly in order to maximize our time. Sometimes on travel you meet an individual who is so special that you know : \"no one could do this better.\" Such was the experience we had with Roelf.

From beautiful scenery to the down right crazy activities (i.e. bungy jumping), this tour has it all. We opted to stay in Guesthouses on the tour and their location and standards were great; clean, beautifully decorated and quite spacious. Although the tour involves a lot of activities during the day, we didn\u2019t feel rushed to get through anything and even had time in the afternoon and evenings to meet some of the locals and experience the best the towns we were staying in had to offer. Nicole our guide was like a fountain of knowledge and really went out of her way to accommodate any of our needs. If you like meeting new people, like having a little adventure in your life and you\u2019re prepared to be entertained by an absolutely outstanding guide look no further; you have found your tour! I highly recommend this tour to anyone who would like to see the best South Africa has to offer in a limited time frame.

Nicole was young, vivacious and more than anything, she was knowledgable. We enjoyed the Garden Tour with Nicole so much that we enlisted her services on our return to Capetown. She entertained us virtually 12 hours a day and because of her flexibility, she made our every wish come true. We stayed in up scaled backpackers, traveled in a Mercedes van and were able to go from a picnic in the park to eating in the finest restaurants with only a phone call by our guide. She even juggled activities, when part of the group wanted to split. She was willing to drop off and pick up each of us at different times and locations.

There was so much more to do and see on this trip and Hendrik actually joined us on a few of the activities too :) Hendrik was so committed to ensuring that we really enjoyed our trip that he even adjusted the schedule slightly to accommodate changes for two people in our tour AND tried to get us booked in for paragliding (not on the itinerary at all). We didn't end up doing the paragliding because the weather refused to cooperate - no wind one day and then it decided to rain buckets the next day.My friend and I opted to stay at guesthouses but I never dreamed that we'd staying four star guest lodges (that's the highest rating possible). Believe me when I say that the guest house option is well worth the extra payment! The backpacker places were also really fun and we half regretted not choosing the backpacker accommodation (well, until we went back to our rooms and enjoyed the amazing views and extra comforts). Oh and those with specific dietary needs, you can rest easy. The Earthstompers team really go that extra mile to ensure you really enjoy your time with them.The only gripe that I have is that the tour was over way too quickly. The 6 day tour + Addo adventure is by far the best way to see South Africa when you have budget and time constraints for locals and tourists alike. I highly recommend it to any and everyone :)"

Our group of 6 academics covered a lot of kilometers with Nicole and she was always smiling, always excited about where we were and where we were going. She is an amazing and safe driver, a really knowledgeable guide and she faced any plan change or delay with her sparkling personality and unreal problem-solving skills. I cannot recommend her highly enough!"

We thought we were traveling with a friend who just happened to know the area. So not only was he fun, but very knowledgeable. Also very easy going and flexible....even adjusted the schedule so I could go sky diving which was not originally scheduled. My friend and I also thought the pricing for the tour was a great value for all we did/saw as well as for the accommodations."

He was great to hang out with on top of being a great guide! He knew the route like the back of his hand and did everything in his power to make the trip the best it could be. He succeeded! The routes, the attractions and the guest suites were all wonderful: No complaints about any of them. Hendrik accommodated my vegetarian needs SO well! I couldnt believe it! He was a delightful face to greet in the mornings, and always had entertaining stories and facts to divulge it. Even the travel van was roomy, and comfortable. Hendrik and Earthstompers was the South African experience of a lifetime, and I would go back and re-visit him personally, anytime he would have us! THANKS FOR EVERYTHING!"

It is a personalized tour through the region that hits all the highlights. Hendrick Human is the owner/ operator and he has developed great relationships to secure terrific accomodation and access to the key sights. The tour was seemless, no missed attractions, no problems.Because he is from the area, Hendrick brings a wealth of knowledge and pride to the tour. You get an insider's perspective.It was a terrific 6 days."

This is not the standard Garden route, but we panned so because we wanted to fly thereafter from Port Elizabeth to Victoria Falls Zimbabwe. We had arranged and preplanned everything with Hendrik in advance via emails. I will not come in to details about the Garden route and the specifics, but I will emphasize how informative, helpful, and self motivated Hendrik was, in order to help us make the right choices during the planning. From the beginning Hendrik was suggesting helping and planning everything as if it was doing this for a friend. From the moment Hendrik picked up us from our hotel in Cape town to the moment we hugged good bye in Port Elisabeth he was absolutely a great professional guide as well as a great companion. We learned a lot for this part of the world, the people, the culture, the traditions and a lot more for South Africa. A VERY THANK YOU \"Mr. Earthstomper\" Hendrik."

South Africa - Western Cape - Garden Route Adventure ToursA very professionally run tour \u2026 with a wonderful personal touch. Hendrik (our tour guide) went out of his way to accommodate the quirks and requests of all guests \u2026 and always with a smile. The adventures are mainly optional, so travel companions can opt for a relaxed tour through the beautiful and ever changing environment of the Western Cape or go for an adrenalin rush (bungy jumping, sky diving, shark cage diving, etc) ... or get a good mix. Hendrik tries (where possible) to accommodate even a last minute change of mind.The backpackers accommodations are in superb locations (offering options of private / semi private rooms) with a very personal touch. The included meals are very special and add to the overall experience of this trip - ostrich braai (BBQ), scramble eggs (from an ostrich egg), curries and a specially prepared meal by your guide :) Overall - a trip for everyone - the young and the young at heart .If you like to go a little bit off the beaten track ... go for it!"

I was traveling alone and short on ime so preferred to do a tour rather than hire a car to explore the Garden Route. It was very well organised, saw all the major attractions and there were lots of optional extras eg bungy jumping, skydiving, shark cage diving, whale watching, tree top canopy tour etc. The tour guide, Hendrik, a Mossel Bay local, was very knowledgeable, friendly and flexible. The accommodation was fantastic, was very impressed with the standard of hostels/guest houses. Most meals were included and there was plenty of free time to explore the towns on your own if you wanted. I would recommend doing the elephant park optional extra, Getting so close to and being able to touch orphaned elephants in a small reserve was an amazing experience. I got to ride an ostrich, explore Cango Caves, fly through the trees with Tsitsikamma Tree Top Canopy Tours, feed elephants and spot whales in Hermanus to name but a few highlights. All in all a great tour with something to suit everyone."

The trip far exceeded my expectations and I had a amazing time.Earthstompers is operated by a friendly, cool, yet professional local guy named Hendrik, who has been guiding for a number of years and really knows his stuff. He can tailor the trip to the individual's needs and offers various accommodation options including dorm, single room and guest-house.Almost all meals are including and I especially liked the huge buffet at the game lodge.I addition to seeing the amazing Garden Route/Route 62 and visiting Oudtshoorn, Wilderness, Knysna, Plettenberg Bay, Tsitsikamma , Mossel Bay, Cape Agulhas and Hermanus, included in the trip are visits to a winery, Cango Caves, an ostrich farm, canoeing, a game reserve and a wildlife centre. Optional extras include the world;s highest commercial bungy jump (216 metres - fantastic!!!), sand-boarding, a tree top canopy tour, skydiving and shark cage diving.I would thoroughly recommend this tour as it had the feel of a private tour, yet was very well priced. Keep up the good work Hendrik!"
