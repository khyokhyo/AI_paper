Only downside is that when we visited there was a number of rides out of action. I understand that maintenance needs to be undertaken, its just a bit dissappointing when you arrive to find 3 of the attractions closed for maintenance."

When we arrived the place looked lovely. We had to queue for a short time which was no problem, we were not informed any rides were shut when paying for the waterpark. The food deal is good as the food was fantastic in the restaurant. 4 rides were shut which was very disappointing. The beach is beautiful and the rides and lazy river which were open were very good."

The price of the food and drink is quite expensive though so I would advise you to bring your own bottled water etc to save some money.

            "review": "Good fun but been to better waterparks. If your comparing this water park to others (i.e. Disney) its not anywhere close to that standard. Less rides and shorter in duration when on them. Slightly chaotic with the planning of the rides as the tubes used for some of them are no where near the actual ride itself. When visiting Disney waterparks the tubes are always at the end of the ride so people know where to collect them from.Some of the rides were fun as they went upwards which was different and you could access them from the lazy river around the park which was a great idea. The family tube rides were really good and went on them several times. The lazy river with rapids option probably best bit of the park.We went in early October so thankfully quieter compared to what I imagine it could be like during the busier periods. The floor was boiling hot so needed flip flops or similar to walk around, (would be useful if they sprayed water on the paths to help with this as they do in Disney!!) Worth a visit at least once and probably ideal for people who are staying at the Atantlis who have kids but I wouldn't rush back."

The rides were super fun. Poseidon\u2019s Revenge, The Leap Of Faith, Aquaconda, Zoomerango and the Water Coasters in particular were awesome! Though the park was busy, there was hardly any wait for the rides. Food & drink was reasonably priced. Be sure to wear flip flops or water shoes as the ground does get hot! Overall this is one of the best waterparks I've been too and just as good as Wild Wadi if not better."

This turned out to be the best inclusion, as we spent most of our time there. The kids area was fab for our toddlers but also had shaded areas for adults to sit too. We really enjoyed the rides, and the lazy river and Rapids were great too! Towels were also included complementary too, which doesn't happen at every Waterpark. There was plenty of shaded areas and sun loungers, but it was relatively quiet in late September mid-week.Only downside was work being completed on the wave pool meaning this was out of action, but didn't spoil a great few days.Great fun and should be on the must-visit list!"

There are few aquaparks in Dubai but this is the one, highly recommended. You can spend your whole day with different difficulty level of water skis. There are place to eat, rest and drink. The price is cheaper than the ones in Europa and the US. Its safe and staff are friendly. I would strongly recommend you to take \"leap of faith\" drive. It was wowwwww :)"

            "review": "Expensive but lots to do. We went to Aquaventure on a weekday, which meant that the park was not busy and we didn't queue at all for anything. At 320dhs, this is more expensive than the competition, but the advantage is that the park stretches onto the beach. There are plenty of rides to get stuck into as well, more than Wild Wadi, and in our opinion slightly better.One disappointing thing was that, out of 11 rides, 4 were not fully functional. Shamal, Surge and Plunge were not operational at all. Also the shark viewing tank was being refurbished, so no sharks on view, and also when riding on Shark Attack it meant riders were plunged into a tank full of construction and building work. Not quite the same effect! Seeing as this is a major selling point of the park, it's a shame that no discounts were offered off the entrance fee, especially as this information did not seem readily available on the website. In hindsight we'd recommend ringing ahead to find out if any rides are closed.One other point to note if you're thinking of driving there. It's valet parking only, which costs 150dhs. If you spend this amount on food you get this money back, BUT you have to go back out of the park and into the forecourt, you can't use it at Barracuda or Shark Bites. Despite this, we still enjoyed our day, and happy to give 4 stars."

The location is spectacular, located in the Palm Jumeirah (we had to get there by taxi for 35AED as metro does not go there). Cost wise it was expensive but worth it. Not sure it was worth us getting our lunch with admission though. You only get a very small choice from the menu if you pay beforehand so definitely recommend buying lunch separately. Definitely also take sandals (which may sound obvious to some but i made the mistake of not taking any and the floor was way too hot to walk in). All the rides were so much fun. It's very child friendly. The atmosphere was great, welcoming and very friendly people/staff. There was a bit of a queue for the showers though and you have to pay about 40 AED for a small locker...so like i said it's expensive! But worth it! And it's all in a shopping mall at the bottom of one of the most eye catching hotels in Dubai so plenty of other things to do."

Food (fast food inside the park) was OK, and easy to come byThe rides was ok, but the height limit was 120cm on most of them. (Compared to 110cm at wWwp) My 6year old son couldn't do much there, witch was a bit boring. Also, most of the rides are not as thrilling as in wWwp IMO (there was one 4-person ride I didn't get to try)Outside we had to wait 30-45 minutes in a taxi-line to get home. The palm is situated a bit remote, and taxis were not abundant in the evening apparently. Close by the park, there are many restaurants, the aquarium and a few shopsIMO the wWwp was the better choice of the two, and we will pay it another visit tomorrow"

This is the first ever water park I have ever been to and it was so good!From the family dinghy rides to the tallest single rider slide in Dubai, I loved it all.I felt at ease with the hundreds of life guards all through the park, down the lazy river, in shallow pool areas and at the ends of each and every slide. They're there to look after you, make sure your safe and have little bit of a laugh with you as you go around.Make sure you keep your flip flops/water shoes nearby as the ground gets extremely hot throughout the day and to avoid burning your feet you need to try and get out of the water where you left them!Hats and suncream are needed especially as the temperatures reach mid 30s and higher very easily even though there is plenty of shade and sunbeds to retreat under.Photos for slides are available and staff give you wristbands with codes on so you can see them on photo machines at the end of the day but they do work out to be around \u00a310 each per photograph, so this is something to keep in mind and maybe only choose the best photo out of them all at the end of the day.Entry is free to hotel guests and towels are included in the price too, however lockers you still have to pay for if you want to store your clothes, snack, suncream etc.My only regret is that we didn't go to the waterpark early enough in the holiday to truly be exhausted by it.

Is poorly mapped and the lifeguards all give you contradictory information! By no means that amazing experience they advertise! 'Leap of faith' is a cool slide! The 'shark' slide was closed as they had a leak! The lockers are somewhat inconveniently located very far away. I would create some sort of small lockers from place to place where people could put a mobile or a camera or their sunnies while they go for a slide."

It is home of dolphin bay where you can swim with dolphins and this gets you free entry to the waterpark. It is very spread out so there are little buggies that can drive you to different areas but this is a bit tedious. It is very clean. Lockers are expensive. It's not as good as Wild Wadi. Dolphins were incredible however. A major highlight but is an expensive activity and the professional photographs were ridiculously expensive. Over \u00a320 for a single 6x4. You can buy an observer ticket and the observer can stand on the beach near the dolphin pool and take photographs (no videos) and this is close enough to take great photos although the angles not quite as good as the professional who is in the water. The observer pass was about \u00a360 but also includes free access to waterpark as well."

It was the craziest slides i have ever tried in my life, but it was a lot of fun! My mother stayed in quiet sunbathing areas and enjoyed it there. Occasionally she came on some of the lighter water rides with us. Some are literally for all age groups, where you just lay in a round air mattress and float through the water, being pushed by some light flow. The security and lifeguards are extremely careful and friendly. Security is their main priority, and it is taken care of accordingly. Furthermore it is clean and above european standards! All in all, it is an amazing place to go for anyone who like waterrides or has kids that enjoy them, since for adults there is plenty of space to relax. Besides, it has its own beach, where you can also play volleyball, bath in the sea or kajak... there is also an amazing zip line in the park!"

The park is large with two main towers of slides, each one having about 6/7 slides each. There's loads and loads of steps to climb up to the slides, so after 4 hours of fun, we were wrecked from all the stairs (and we're fit runners!). Poseidon's revenge is not as long as similar slides in Florida but worth trying. Favourite slide was zoomerango, really fast, adrenaline filled and worth doing with a large group of friends- the dingy can take 6 adults.Everything in the park is very pricy, as you'd expect and beds tend to be reserved from mid morning. They don't allow you bring your own food or drinks in (except for water) so be warned- it'll just be confiscated and dumped in the bin!There's deals with your entrance fees where you can get a discounted lunch included, which is worth doing as we worked up quite an appetite sliding down all the slides."

Life jackets are provided .If you are staying at Atlantis it is very convenient and entry is included; they will take you via buggy to the door. The ground is very hot and you will appreciate the ride. There are plenty of chairs and towels and places to sit. See my review of Disney Aulani Hawaii.

Good taxi rank pick up point to leave the park as well.One down side of Atlantis is that you have to pay in cash for drinks/ food! A waterproof credit band would be so much easier, as the walk to the locker rooms is quite far when you are in the middle of the park and want a water! You are given a paper map when you get to the park however more signage is needed, paper map when you are wet and limited to what you can carry around isn't a great idea! Other water parks we have been to have big map signs which I think would be useful. In addition when you are the queuing signage for rides should be clearer as sometimes their are separate queues for different rides very close together."

You have to take a shuttle from the parking lot to the Waterpark. It's an old and rusty bus, that was driving too fast and honking it's horn to the very guests it picked up the next moment (us included). Waiting in the shuttle to fill every seat was not convenient with our young kids that were eager to get going. Once we made it to the water park, we had to wait in line in the exhausting heat to collect our tickets, even though we had paid beforehand. Towels, lockers and everything cost extra, and tickets are pricy to begin with. The lockers were the worst. They are tiny little rooms where you can't even imagine fitting yourself and your children, which leaves you with the option to get changed in the common area or women/men's locker room. However if you get undressed there, a staff member will notify you it's inappropriate. This makes things very difficult for someone with young children that can't be left unsupervised. The rides and pools themselves are nice, but the whole experience was too draining for us. For older kids and adults it's probably a lot of fun. With young ones, wouldn't recommend."

It is also quite expensive to get entry, I think around \u00a380 and there was no discount given to say certain rides were shut. I was also really disappointed as we had to travel to Atlantis from Dubai town by taxi and paid 40AED which was reasonable, however when we left we were told by staff who were showing people to taxi's outside the entrance that it was a fixed price of 120AED to get back to town. We did argue this however we were told that this is what we had to pay. The taxi driver had no meter in his car and we did the exact same journey that we had made to get to the water park although it was three times the price!! Since then I have spoken to my friend who lives in Dubai and she said that I should have reported it to the hotel as the staff should not be charging fixed rates.So watch out for that if you are getting taxi's too and from the water park!!"

Luckily we pre booked tickets as the card payment system was down so we struggled to rent towels and a locker. The manager S Gomez was very incompetent with dealing with a system issue they had with card payments as they could not take any rather than being apologetic and trying to rectify the issue or come to some sort of agreement he was just being rude and saying he could not do anything and said was not his fault but the banks. That is not a way of good customer service to lay the blame on other people. He basically told us to go to the arm and get cash out regardless of me pouting out that taking cash out using the credit card would incite forex charges and additional interest charges to take cash out (which at the end I had to do due to mr Gomez not playing ball) I even offered to pay offered to leave my card and come back and pay later when the system issue was sorted but he was not having any of it. Was so disappointed in the end that we ended up leaving the water park after an hour. Please train your staff in how to deal with problems and have contingencies in place when things go wrong."

Back to the water park, sufficient sun beds and good quality towels available. It seemed safe to leave valuables whilst you enjoyed yourself on one of the many the lazy river trails.

The size of the park is great and the shuttle runs between the two towers if its a little to warm to walk. The leap of faith is scary but also addictive, once you have been down its a race back to the top to do it all over again. My favourite ride is the slitherine where you race against a friend in the tube next to you. There are also a number of slides where you ride in either a 1 or 2 person tube and 2 where you are in larger dinghy which hold up to 5. The lazy river is great as it includes rapids and is an easy way to get round the park. The only ride which is just ok is \"The Torrent\", which is a tube ride on a wave machine, it is too long and you are bored after one go. The food outlets are mixed, best recommendation is to buy a refillable cup especially if planning to go more than once. By far the best water park in Dubai"

Last piece of advise.....when getting a taxi home we were advised by staff outside to get a taxi at a fixed price of 70 uae, because of the rush hour traffic, con!! The metre in the taxi stops if you're not moving. They'll just charge a fixed fee more at rush hour. Go on the metre. Overall, brilliant day."

Upon approaching the gates at the entrance of the water park we showed the attendants our room key and joined a queue where we were given a band to wear around our wrists to allow us entry into the park. We paid for a locker at this point as well. However, once we had entered the park we bought a waterproof plastic see through case that you wear around your neck that holds your iPhone, and you are able to take photos through it. We also kept some money in the case for snacks and food which is sold around the park. We found that if you don't have a lot of items to lock away it is not really necessary to pay for a locker and the waterproof case. We had paid for both unnecessarily. We found Aquaventure a thrilling experience and there was an abundance of lifeguards all along the routes of the water slides, and all around the park, so you felt completely safe. Aquaventure is so much fun for all ages !!!!!"

The lazy river with intermittent Rapids and Torrents was really relaxing... you could just stay floating on it all day long. Poseidon's and Neptune's towers have a good number of adrenaline pumping activities. However, if you are the scary kind... avoid the Leap of Faith and Poseidon's revenge. It would be best to stay in house at Atlantis the Palm to enjoy the park unlimited number of times in a day."

This way its will be a great value. People normally calculate for one day, by staying at the hotel, you get it for both the days - the day you check in and the day you check out and if you get a ate checkout like we checked in right at 12 pm and checked out at 4 pm, you will have a ball of a time.- Buy the Go-Pro with a head band to record the real adventure.- Buy the waterproof mobile pouches at the Atlantis shop, worth it than buying a locker for 40 AEDs.- Start from the river area in front of Kids Splasher Pool. This is the best point as it leads to Torrents and Rides and you manage to come back to the same spot you have started from- Buy zip-lining right in the morning the next day, that way you can do it as many times as you want to.- take a light breakfast as some of the rides, you will have a problem with a full stomach- take your own beach sandals, the hotel ones are very flat.- opens up at 10 so be there at 9:45 am to start it early- plan, read it in on their website and get the max bang for your buck- Keep a pack of panadol - you will need it for both the days.- keep some band-aids handy as you may need them"

Love the lazy river just floating along on your inflatable ring not a care in the world. The leap of faith is a must, queues can be a bit long but worth waiting for. Food and drink is quite expensive and don't try to sneak your own in as they check your bag and confiscate them off you.

We visited on a Friday which we thought was going to be very busy as it is the weekend for people in the UAE. we arrived at about 10.30 time and it wasn't too busy so we went up and done the leak of faith flat to get that out of the way which was a great way to begin with a big adrenaline rush dropping down 9 stories. We hired a locker and a towel for 50d. Which is not to bad the towels are huge which is good. We went on all the different rides and only really had to que up for two rides which was only for about 15-20 minutes. The disappointment was that the ride going through the shark tank was open but there was nothing in the shark tank, so you just bobbed along looking into an empty tank. The dissapointing thing was that there was no signs saying about it or no monies off the price of the tickets as not all working. There was one other ride not working as well which was a shame to again no signs beforehand saying it was closed. The other rides were great thou and we throughly enjoyed our day out on the lazy river going around enjoying the sun. I would say if you want to go to sunbathe then get yourself a lounger early as they more than likely will go. We didn't have a lounger and you don't really need one as you dry off instantly and there are seats to sit on when buying food drink etc. All in all this is a great day out where you can enjoy the sun and the water rides.."

The water park is very well done, cleaner than most water parks as well. The rides are fun and some, really fast. You need a whole day, not only because of the fact that you want to try the rides several times, but you queue like never before, and remember in the Dubai heat, you spend at least half of your day waiting in a queue under the baking sun. All in all a fun experience. I have been there several times and I like the rides and the different things to look at. Avoid all public holidays and days where most people are off work. It will make it the trip from hell. Enjoy"

It was a bit pricey but I was not surprised I mean this is at ATLANTIS. It was however worth every penny, the children's pool with the slides was amazing. The water was nice and low even my 1 year old was comfortable to be left alone. It was a perfect place to cool off as you can imagine Dubai weather.

We didn't stay in the hotel but a quick taxi ride took us out to the edge of the palm and the waterpark. Loads of slides to suit everyone (thrill seekers and chill-seekers alike)!My personal favourite was the shark attack that takes you through the fish tank, absolutely breath-taking. We also did the zip line for a small additional fee, and while it was fun, I probably wouldn't bother with it again, I found it quite sedate!Using the lockers in the changing room can be slightly tricky but when you get it sussed its relatively straightforward. Food onsite is basic but nice. There are also plenty of toilets around for use.We stayed on the lazy river and went round and round for hours until it was time to leave. I will be back!"

We have been there in September and the weather was too hot (more than 40 C) to be pleasant to stay the whole day outside as there are almost no shades to hide (very limited number of umbrellas; dappled tree shades); water too warm to be pleasant. Only junk food inside, again - very overpriced. They offer pictures taken on you (you can see them when exiting the park) which are approx. 30 USD each, only on paper (no digital copy)! In general - if you have plenty of time to spend in Dubai and you are visiting the park during the season, which is not so hot it may be worth it as it is an interesting attraction, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."

I had heard many mixed reviews about the place and I'm glad we went and experienced it for ourselves. Being UAE residents, we only paid AED 195 per adult for entrance when we showed our Emirates IDs. The rides were in good condition, and there were lifeguards stationed everywhere - lovely for parents worried about taking their children. My favourite rides were the rides at the Tower of Poseidon (Aquaconda, Zoomerango, Slitherine and Poseidon's Revenge). I did feel that the water flow was a little too weak in the rapids, which resulted in many people just bobbing in one place and causing a backlog. Tip: Get there early! We were able to do all the rides between 10:00am -12:00 as there weren't too many queues."

I recomend paying for a locker with towel if you don\u00b4t have yours and also buy the meal deal as it is less expensive than the normal food inside the fast food restaurants. You are not allowed to take food inside, just water and I advise it. Inside each small botle is 12 AED ( normal price is just 3 AED). To get there you can take the metro to the station where it links to the tram and then from the tram go and catch the monorail.

My tip is take water shoes, although they ask you to take them off and hold them on certain rides \"Leap of Faith\" etc as to walk around the park is an impossibility with the extreme temperatures of the floors. We had 4 Slush drinks in the park and it cost \u00a325.00 !!! You come out feeling shattered. If we return to Dubai next year we will give it a miss."

It was our second return to The Atlantis Aquaventure water park as we did it last year on our trip to Dubai and it was the highlight of our trip we loved it and couldn't talk about it enough. But this year was an entirely different story. As we were walking through park on our way to lazy we noticed some construction going on and some places blocked off to the public but didn't take much notice then we proceeded to the lazy river which 90% of it was fine until you came to section where there were doing construction and there was loads of rubble and dirt coming into the lazy river and they had one lifeguard in the water trying his best to push people out of the way. We then proceeded to go on the slides and as shark attack was my favourite ride last year I was greatly looking forward to it because as a lot of you know you come down the tube tunnel and in to a see through long glass tunnel where you can see the Sharks and thousands of other fish which is amazing . But to my shock came out of the tunnel into the glass box to find no water and no fish terrible we were like what is going on here and made our way around what would be great attractions watching all the fish in tanks around the park there was nothing just bare dirt. We were so dissapointed at this it just ruined our day there and the fact that they do not tell you this on entrance when paying is a disgrace they should have at least a discount running and give people proper notice (shame on you Atlantis) I spoke to one of the people whom worked there and he said that some pipe had burst there about a month ago and they had to empty all the fish tanks to repair it and it's unknown when it will be finished maybe a month or two. It's totally understandable and these things do happen but let the public know before people go wasting there money to see something that's not there. TERRIBLE"

These lockers are situated in changing rooms so if you have boys and girls in same group, either take two lockers or be ready to deliver other group member's stuff to the locker and back. Some diving \"shoes\" or similar can be good, but we where barefoot and it worked fine. Slides are soooo much fun!

We found staff were not helpful, the layout was not thought through (you can hire towels, but cannot collect them near the changing rooms, for example - only a 5 minute walk away - yet you only need them at the end of your visit when you get changed). Loads of rides, and you cannot do them all in a day, but very few suitable for younger children. Probably great for a group of adults or families with teens, but we were held back because there was so little for our youngest to do. The area for little children closed during the day as someone had 'made it dirty' - great that it is kept clean, but it meant there was nothing at all left for ours to do. Lifeguards were amazing and very thorough. The day was spoilt by the other staff, though, and we were hugely disappointed that an attraction aimed at children was full of cigarette smoke, particularly outside the changing rooms and near the rides (totally unlike the rest of Dubai where smoke was almost non-existent)."

She sat on the beach. The whole day cost me \u00a3258 WOW That is a lot. That price included 3 adults in water park, entry to aquarium + lunchFood,, well Soggy burger Disgusting.Water park, its massive and proper spread out. which is not nice in 45 degree heat.I know they cant help the heat,(+ i love the heat) but lockers were miles away, so you couldn't carry money around with you, so that meant you dehydrated. One water slide we queued for over half an hour in that heat. They need a water machine up the stairs or something. I went to a water park in Paphos in May, it was fantastic you had barcoded wrist bands where you could buy a drink without carrying cash around and pay at the end.. Solves all the problems of people dehydrating and killing over in the heat.Back to the slides, so spread out and busy I got to go on 4,, I had enough just to busy..I cant believe this water park doesn't even have any nice big pools or a wave machine pool..At least my wife could have enjoyed it a bit more. The sun loungers are near enough on top of each other, its like looking at a tin of sardines.The main reason why I wanted to go to this water park over the others was because of the shark tank, where you go into on a ring or in a slide...Guess what it was empty being worked on AAAGGHH.. That explains the day I had their.The Aquarium was nice. It had some lovely colourful fish in the tanks.. Please do not ask me to name any of them except the ones from finding Nemo ( i only know their personal names)The reason being not one tank had a chart on saying what is what... How is anyone suppose to learn...Overall review.. You are paying for the name and location. That is it..Mr & Mrs P"

We visited from 23rd August to 28th August and found the park reasonably quiet in the mornings if we got to the park for 1000am. Tuesday was the quietest day and Friday & Saturday were the busiest days.We took the golf buggy ride from Atlantis and got dropped at the Barracuda restaurant stop at there are locker facilities there that are less busier than at the front of the park.Obviously during August it is very hot but we actually managed to stay fairly cool as we were in the water for most of the time. Because of the heat the floor surface gets very warm so I would recommend you were pool shoes or sandals throughout the park. You are allowed to carry them in your hands on the water rides so we found it much better wearing them than leaving them in the locker. Queue time during our visit was generally less than 5 mins. There were two attractions closed for maintenance during our visit but this had no impact on our enjoyment.We normally holiday in Florida every year and we have visited most of the waterpark there. What we particular liked about Aquaventure was that some of the attractions you could go on without having to get out of the inflatable ring as you were transported uphill sitting in it.The views from the waterpark of the Palm Island are incredible. The kids have already told me we are going back next year!"

The price is about what you would expect (AED195 for UAE residents, AED320 for tourists) and the price of food etc. once inside is reasonable. The rides are all great fun and there's a good variety of them. The lazy river that winds its way through the park is especially well thought out. What isn't well thought out is the fact that you would normally expect to be able to walk around a water park in bare feet, but this is barely possible at Aquaventure as the ground (at least today when I was there) was scorching hot, making you run from one scarcely shaded area to the next. It's completely ridiculous. If you do decide to wear flip flops from ride to ride then you're forced to either leave them at the bottom of the ride or carry them in your hands while you slide. I would recommend wearing your flip flops to one of the entrances to the lazy river, then leaving them there and using the lazy river to get near to the slides to minimise your walking distances. The other area that they fall down on is signage. Knowing where all of the slides are and how to get to them is not very obvious, and when you arrive at the base of a set of slides there are no signs telling you which way to go, no signs telling you which rides require a tube or not, and no signs telling you which line to choose for a particular ride. Quite how they can miss something so obvious baffles me. My advice - just copy what most people around you are doing and explore each line/set of stairs yourself. Overall, the park is great, I think I prefer Aquaventure to Wild Wadi, but I'd still say Yas Waterworld is better as far as rides are concerned, if you're happy to make the drive to Abu Dhabi."

The queues could be long, I recommend going first thing in the morning or an hour before closing if there is something specific you want to do, without wasting your day queuing. My reason for 4 stars is because the ground was so hot it burnt your feet! You couldn't leave your flipflops if you were going down a waterslide and only certain rides you could take them with you. Therefore they need more areas whereby bear footed people can stand without burning, whilst queuing up for the rides. My adice is get as close as you can to a pool and get on the rides from there, instead of standing and queuing."

We love Aquaventure and have visited many times both as guests when staying at Atlantis and as day visitors when staying at another hotel.We have had some great times here but this most recent trip took the shine off it for us.For a start the park was so busy. I spoke with a member of staff who said that there was around 4000 visitors that day. Capacity was 12,000 and the most they had ever had on one day was 10,000. I can only imagine it would be hellish with those numbers!The lazy river was packed and huge bottlenecks were forming around the travelators which I didn't feel comfortable with.A couple of the rides (Aquaconda and Shamal) were closed for maintenance (didn't see any maintenance going on) but what really spoiled it for us this time was the behaviour of some other park guests.We left our belongings by Splashers and when we returned a lady and her family had completely taken over our loungers, moved our things onto the floor and pretended not to understand a word of what we were saying. Our clothes were still hanging from the back of the sun loungers and only when we threatened to call security did she move - to someone else's lounger! Another day we returned to wet towels and empty drinks cans on our table and on our final day, someone stole our towel. I don't know what's happened to the clientele visiting Aquaventure but I wasn't impressed.Food and drinks very expensive but 15% discount with Emirates Skywards card helps.Our daughter wanted to do the zipwire ride but every day we went it was closed for maintenance. Again didn't see any work going on.We have so many happy memories of visiting Aquaventure previously and because of this I am giving it 4 stars.ps. the staff ( lifeguards/team leaders etc) are always excellent."

Cost AED 260 which equates to about \u00a355.00 for adults and AED 215 = \u00a345.00 children the above fees are only available online so maybe a bit more in person. But if you are a resident of the hotel then all is free all day every day for the duration of your stay. May i also add they do have rides that are not for the faint hearted....Just saying."

I suggest you book online rather than at the door as it cost us a lot more and we were a group of 6!It was about 36 degrees and there is not a lot of shade. The floor is burning hot and I remember seeing this in the reviews but my father-in-law thought he could manage and didn't pack any flip flops. Needless to say, he had to buy a pair for about \u00a330 which was painful.We didn't use the lockers as we always had to rotate with someone watching stuff and keeping our sun beds. My husband ended up hurting his coccyx while going on the green kids slides with our daughter. This messed up the rest of our holidays as it meant he could do nothing else while we were in Dubai. On the rapids as well, while going up the ramp, there is potential to do some damage to the coccyx so we always had to lift our bums up whilst going up the ramp! This was something else I read on here before we went on holiday but didn't pay any attention till my husband hurt himself!Everything was expensive there in terms of food and drinks. We went for the drink package which cost about \u00a315 for the bottle and then we always had to pay about \u00a34 or so for a refill. Because of the really hot weather, we were always extremely thirsty. On the rides as well, there was not a lot of shaded areas so you would love it if you like the intense sun. Overall, nice water park with enough activities for kids of various ages . I'd rather go without the intense heat and will plan better."

My son who was 6 then could do most of them, or at least accompanied with an adult. But beware of the burning floor! We literally burnt our feet and we were running from one slide to the other. So get organized (unlike us) and bring a pair or water shoes which you can wear while on the slides (no flip flops though). You can always buy them in the park as we were obviously not the only one in this case... They have people controlling the slides at the departure and the arrival which make you feel more secure. Food is not cheap though. I personally loved the rapids which was quite fun. My daughter who was 3 then had limited access but I must say, the kids zone was big enough (and scary enough!) for her, knowing that she can swim already and is not afraid of water. Some slides were really scary for my own self ... And some I would never try (like the big pyramid and the one that shoots from from a tube). For people who like being in the dark they have quite a few slides in the total dark... The fun one is when you arrive in the middle of an aquarium filled with fish (not for the claustrophobic like me though... Did it once, not twice!). We stayed at the Palm finding it more convenient and they were offering a good package with the park. My son is still talking about it and it has been a year now!"

I endeavoured to try out all the rides. My favourite was the leap of faith. If the park could be improved it would be to somehow change the flooring so it didn't heat up as the few occasions I walked around with out thongs the ground really burnt my feet.

We visited as part of our stay at the Atlantis and so it was free. Our little daughter really loved the dinghy rapids ride and I tried the 'leap of faith'. Unfortunate that shark tank was under maintenance so the ride where you go through the shark tank was closed. We spent the whole the day there but it was extremely difficult to find any loungers (even the private cabanas were all occupied). Towels were free for hotel guests. There was a golf buggy service taking hotel guests from the park to the pool (and other areas) which was quite useful."

However, lockers & towels soon rack up the cost.There were sunbeds available unlike other parks we've been to which was a bonus & prior knowledge would have perhaps negated the need for lockers!There is a lot of walking from lockers to main attractions & the need for cash at food outlets is a real bore as that requires a return visit to lockers! Otherwise you are carrying valuables with you on the rides which seems to ask for trouble!The food & drinks were eyewateringly expensive, we racked up a phenomenal bill on 4 sandwich deals & drinks. Souvenir cups are extortionate & refills cost even more - seriously never experienced that before ! I will ignore kids demands next time !! There is a bottled water deal 6 bottles = 55AED - the first sign of reasonable!Due to a family hiccup, we only played on the lazy river and tube rides off it, we didn't think it was as thrilling as some parks we've been to but we all had fun & went home exhausted (& bruised - keep your bum up !). You will need shoes of some sort at all times as the surfaces are not cooled.We would not return, expensive and too much hassle/worry carting cash around."

You are charged for everything lockers, towels. The changing rooms were clean and well maintained. Best to lock everything in the locker but it is quite a walk back to go for bits and pieces throughout the day. The children's play area was great. It was huge but extremely crowed. Life guards were very attentive and loads of them. The lazy river was good too. We visited Dolphin cove and would suggest you jumped into the little golf carts as its a long way to walk in boiling heat. As part of the ticket we payed for included lunch we opted for the Baracuda restaurant. Big hamburger restaurant. Food was decent.We also visited the aquarium which is really good and helps you get out of the heat. We spent more time in there than we spent in the water park. Would I return...probably not."

The lazy river is wonderful and for me was the best attraction it can take a a good 30 mins to do one circuit with the occasion rapids which were really fun. Sunbeds are plentiful but most people don't realise they are several sun bed locations so some areas got jammed packed and other empty There are very helpful hop on and off golf buggy taxi's which take you from one part of the park to another. A wide variety of food but a little pricey and they don't allow you to bring any food into the park so you have to buy here. Three scoops of ice cream for \u00a310! We booked direct with the website and got much better prices than were being offered elsewhere so worth comparing before you book. Overall great fun but poor value for money!"

Sun beds get taken quickly and food is of a fast food nature. Gets very busy in the afternoon so I would recommend getting there at opening time.

We got sun loungers on the beach at the edge of the park which was peaceful, right next to the rides and the sea was absolutely lovely. The lazy river, which is usually a family favourite was not the relaxing experience we expected it to be. My teenage daughter got split from the rest of the family and felt hassled by the 'lifeguards' who had fun splashing her and pushing her ring around. My son enjoyed the rides although it is very difficult to know what you are queuing for so you have to be prepared to do anything. We have been to better water parks."

Some parts of the park are closed until further notice and it would have been nice to know before we started our holiday but what can you do?? The part of the park that you go through the shark tunnel was the part all closed. The ride was open but through an empty tank and no shark safari available. We were disappointed that we couldnt do the safari but again what can you do! My daughter who is 8 struggled to sit in the large inflatables but I saw some one with a child inflatable seat which we managed to get after an hour or so. There are not many around and basically have a sealed base so the little people can sit in a ring with or without you but the bottom is sealed a must for anyone under 8 as the waves can carry kids and grown ups away. For everything except the rapids and the lazy river you have to be taller than 1.2 meters so my son didn't get to do the slides. The kids loved the childrens play area which has some great slides and a constant stream of water in your face! Be prepared for some one to shoot water right in your face! Definately worth packing some water shoes or some flip flops that you dont mind leaving somewhere and reclaiming whenever you can back to them. You can buy them there but they were around \u00a320 a pair and I got the kids from Aldi for \u00a33.99 a pair.Its a big place to walk around with young kids and because we went in August it sometimes got too hot. If we went without young kids it would have been easier to cope but seemed mean to leave the kids! haha. We bought some nice ice cones and they cooled us down nicely but at \u00a36 each the prices are that of a captive audience. The lockers are \u00a38 each 40AED, so its not cheap. BUT is lots of fun."

I visited the park with some family members and whilst we all enjoyed the experience, we did leave with a certain degree of disappointment and frustration. Neptune\u2019s Tower was not open, as far as we were aware, due (so we were told) to a private party. I have no verification of this. However, it was clear that the remaining open side of the park was seriously crowded as a result of this and some other maintenance work. We paid full price for half the park. Not really good value. On leaving we joined the taxi queue. There were a number of the hotel taxis blocking access to customers from the normal taxis (of which there were several waiting). This seemed to be a deliberate ploy to try and force customers to use hotel taxis which were double the price. I did complain to the staff with little reaction. So we had a good time but it was somewhat of a let down that half the park was blocked from use and then the money grabbing action of the hotel taxi staff really made for a very bad end to the day. I have e-mailed Aquaventure slightly less that a week ago, without any response so far. I would advise potential customers to call and make sure the full park is open before paying out quite a hefty fee."

Before going I was a little concerned about having to queue in the hot weather however after reading another review which suggested going early we arrived as the park opened at 10am and didn't have to wait more than a few seconds for any of the rides all day. The rides were fantastic, scary but good. As other readers have suggested you need to wear something on your feet, we took some watershoes with us which you can wear on most of the rides and carry down with you on the others. We bought our tickets in advance through Trip Advisor and chose to also go into the Aquarium which was well worth it, this also meant we got a free lunch in the park- so well worth doing. One other thing to note if you go by taxi is not to get in to the slightly posher looking taxi/private car (as opposed to the Dubai Taxis) that was sat at the front of the rank as we left the park, although it was on a meter it was obviously running on a different tariff as it was much more expensive than our fare on the way!"

And the anaconda was not open for the 3 days we were thereAlso the shark tank was empty due to a burst pipe so spoilt the end of the shark attack slide we had looked forward to as it's on every piece of advertising for the Atlantis and the waterpark.If you are holidaying in Dubai, do go.

The lazy river was something that was very new to us as it had log flume type conveyor belts to get you to a summit and then you could choose to either continue floating or go on rapids.The main slides in the middle had some many options, and they had up hill sections in them which is a new one on us. It was also welcomed that you could get onto these slides with the help of a conveyor belt, minimising the time you spent out of the water in the heat.Shade was plentiful and the staff were helpful. It was a shame that two large slides were out of action when we were there, however the staff managed the queues for the other large attractions well - but some guests knowledge of queuing and fairness leaves something to be desired.A great park in Dubai that is convenient to get to if you are staying on the Palm, however not as good as those in the USA."

You can't take your own water in and it was about 50 AED for 6 bottles, which wasn't bad. The park it self is great. The lazy river was the best i've seen. You can go through the river and then it takes you on rides, so no need to queue. To be honest the queues were great anyway and we waited no longer than 5-10 minutes for each ride. There is plenty to do and worth it all. We purchased tickets to go to the Aquarium but we didn't' really have much time so didn't spend that much time in there . But worth going, as it was fantastic. We also paid 40 AED to buy a plastic drinks bottle and then you pay just 8 AED to top it up. This is fine but not all the food and drink outlets do it so you can only go to 2 in particular which is quite annoying to walk there every time (the floor is very hot!)You need to take your flip flops with you everywhere as the floor is so hot, so you have to end up attaching them to your arms in all the rides.

The rubber rings in the lazy pool were fantastic. Lots of life guards were stationed around the pools and extremely vigilant. Lots of deck chairs were at the pools and fresh towels."

Despite it getting very busy you are able to enjoy the amusements and slides and find spaces to settle and relax. It does get tiring if visiting for a day but thats expected.

On arrival I tried to get a special combination which included sitting in a private area including lunch, towels and a locker - as advertised. The cashier could or would not understand this and eventually I gave up and just bought the towel and the locker. Luckily we bumped into Danielle who did manage to get us into the private area ('Poseidons Retreat' i think it was called) with the locker, towel & lunch combo. Seating area was very nice, however, other than Danielle and a couple of others, NO-ONE knew where it was! We were on the Lazy River Rapids ride which is almost 2km long and after a while we wanted to know how far our seating area was. We asked nearly 40 different lifeguards who either shrugged or did not know or worse, just ignored us. Very surprising for Dubai. Lunch was AWFUL. In fact it was downright nasty and I would not recommend it to anyone. If Gordon Ramsey had tasted or had seen anything we were given inside the waterpark I suspect he might have shut down his restaurant that is part of the complex. Changing area did not feel clean as there was water and tissue every where in the shower and loo areas and there were no staff taking care of it. I tried to let someone know only to be met with the same dumbfounded expression or just a shrug of the shoulders - 'not my problem....'This could be a great place again but I have heard the waterparks in Abu Dhabi are much better run and the staff are generally politer.Whoever the GM is of this place, I strongly recommend they have a serious look at staff attitudes and helpfulness and for goodness sake do something about the kitchens offering food in the waterpark! The food standards would be unacceptable in most places in the world, but for Dubai, it is shockingly bad."

Not being a waterpark person, I appreciate this park for what it was and my girlfriend loved it. I think the positive aspects were the amount of rides and how they were all located in 2 areas so quite easy to do all the rides once you figure out the park. The rides were also fun even though 2 of the main ones were shut down on both days we went.My issues were was there wasn't a clear guide how to get around the park and where all the rides were. They need to provide a park map at the beginning to explain where everything is as we did not even figure out there was a whole different area until the second day we went. The guideposts were not clear at all. You will also need to wear your jandals/thongs/flip flops when walking to rides and then hold them on the ride. This is because the floor is just too hot and even though the park provides mats to walk on, it is still too hot and you will burn your feet. Being a gues of the hotel, they provide free towels for guests but for people visiting on their own they will have to rent towels. As others have said, it is expensive to visit which is why if you want to go to this park you should just stay at the hotel to get the free access."

We went on a quiet day and the far 'ziggurat' was virtually deserted - we could run to the top & rise again after each trip.  2 grumbles:1. Like everyone else has said, the F&B is ferociously expensive. 2. We have a 121cm child for whom the visit was something of a 'coming of age', 120cm being the height to qualify for the good stuff. However, there's no uniform nor objective height measure with each ride having their own inconsistent gauge. On one, we were cleared at the bottom only to be refused at the top. Ridiculous. Take a leaf from Wild Wadi's book and have a single measure at the start of the park with all marginal but OK kids getting a definitive 'in' tag or bracelet that clears it once and for all. "

There is only so much sitting at pool one can do. And riding the river in the tubes can be just as relaxing and necessary with such heat. Definitely spend time in the river and the rapids as the best part. The Torrent ( aka tsunami) was not as good as the Atlantis in Bahamas much tamer (smaller). Same as Bahamas there was the water slides in neptunes tower. Side by side racing water slides always fun. Poseidon's tower was fun. This was new to us. Slides in boats fitting six people. SO much fun. And th best (or worst??) was getting the courage to ride Poseidon's Revenge. A single person water slide. You stand in a tube like a cockpit on a tap door and the door opens and down you go. Only lasts 15 seconds or so so while Terrifying also fun and done before you know it. Staying at Atlantis in the imperial club we got complimentary access to the water park. I don't know if that is same for all rooms at atlantis or only in the imperial club class rooms.

With us visiting in August (hottest time of the year in Dubai) we thought it would be much quieter than it was due to the intense 45 plus degree heat. Our initial impression was not good, we got to the sales desks where you purchase tickets and the queue was huge. There was no air conditioning whilst queuing, although due to it being open air they cant help this (although i would suggest an indoor queuing system as queuing in intense heat make people even more agitated).After around 35 mins of queuing in horrendous conditions we finally got to the sales desk and purchased 2 adult tickets plus the towel and locker combo at a total cost of around 650 AED (roughly \u00a3125.00) which we thought was extremely expensive. Not a great start i thought, but if we have a good day it would be worth the initial hassle and expense. I was wrong.The whole place was manic with children running wild and adults fighting for inflatable rings. Each ride was a queue for around one hour so we decided we would lie on a sun lounger instead and take a cool shower when we got too warm. Turns out we couldn't even do that ! EVERY shower point in the waterpark is unable to run cold water and instead runs extremely hot water meaning you cant even cool off in temperatures of 40 degrees plus nor remove the dirty water that you have shared with hundreds of other people.Water is very expensive (13 AED per bottle, around \u00a33.00) for a small bottle, and the food option where ghastly with only burgers, hot dogs and chips on offer. Quite different to the smoked salmon and caviar i had been accustomed to at my hotel i must say. Sign posts to point customers in the right direction for rides are also poor and not made clear at all so lots of people tend to get lost trying to find basic things like the towel collection point. The rides we actually bothered queuing for were OK although not amazing. After 3 hours of frustration we called it a day and returned back to our hotel. All in all, an expensive but disappointing day. Vast improvements need to be made to this water park, not least with bringing in accessible COLD shower points, cheaper drinking water, clear sign posts and cheaper entry tickets as the price is not worth the 3 good rides the park offers."

Firstly in terms of scale this thing is huge ! there are endless slides , all of which are very very good and on par with an american waterpark. The staff are all friendly and super helpful. There is only a few things stopping it been excellent , The queues to enter are huge both in high and low season. They seem super slow at getting people in. My advice is to get there as soon as it opens so you can get a good sunbed or you could be left without. Furthermore, I would not recommend in the colder months as the water is not heated at all and even for somebody from the UK it was freezing. There is also no free wifi available for the park only if you are staying at the hotel Lastly , leaving the park, so it early if you intend to get a taxi, most people at the park are not staying at the hotel so the taxi rank queue can take an hour. If they park was a little more organised it would be 5 stars, it seems very critical but this isn\u2019t a cheap day out so I am been picky, but don\u2019t be put off its an amazing day."

It was a struggle to get sunbeds however (I think the waterpark opens up earlier for those staying in the hotel). On the day we went there a few of the rides were closed and ended up remaining closed throughout the day. When purchasing tickets we weren't told this so I can only assume they closed a short while after we entered the park. The zip line was also closed. The water park looked nice but if you have been to florida this is no where near the same as the quality of the water parks there. I loved the aquarium! Me and my partner seem to go to an aquarium every time we are on holiday as I love going. The albino aligators were something I had never seen before so made this aquarium stand out!"

Having visited many water parks around Europe and Florida i was very suprised at the lack of design details which seperate a good water park from a bad one. There were no pools to relax in at all. Every pool in connected via rides and shoots so you either went on a ride or sat on a bed. In 50 degrees this can be hard if you have small children. If you are staying in Atlantis and you have free access then it's worth going a few times but I wouldn't recommend paying big money especially in july/August. In Cyprus i visited a waterpark where special material is used on the floor to stop your feet burning. Here you have to use your footwear everywhere which can be tricky if a ride finishes a 10 minute walk from where you left them!! There were many people running around all day looking for a bit of shade to cool there feet. Quite funny! If you are coming during July or August then i strongly advise bringing some plastic \"pool shoes\" no other footwear is allowed in pools and although they are sold at the park they are very expensive."

You have to walk a fair bit because the park is huge and when you are on some of the longer ride on rubber rings such as the rapids, you are exposed to the sun for quite a while. We would suggest going in slightly cooler temperatures. There was an abundance of life guards throughout the park and rides who were friendly but also very focused on their jobs."

It is foam and in my opinion would be much safer on that, than loose in my hand where there's the potential it could become a projectile.

It's located on the top of the palm island next to the Atlantis hotel, queues in the morning were not very big on the Sunday (as its a work day,) but expect it to be very busy on the holiday days (fri/sat).First off will go through how the day went before mentioning the issues/tips for future adventurers towards the end, sorry this is gona be quite a read but well worth it.The park overall was well space, tickets cost aroubd 267 AED at the time, the park had 2 towers a number of slides and rides all located in the same tower or location, early on you so get most of the fun rides as there are lower queues. Recommend first find a bench and place your towels,etc there, and come back to it throughout the day, and to do the most popular rides first before queues get big. Each tower has 1 of the 2 drop slides which I recommend to do atleast 1 time as early as possible before you hit the 1-1.5 hour queue later on in the day.First of i went through the rapids and managed to grab a single float (there are double ones too and some slides require these only.) And floated around the park on the raft at the start of the day. Halfway through I started to hit the bigger slides where I had to climb towers and go down, I a manged to clear all 6-7 slides on the tower of Neptune and it was amazing.Shortly towards the end of the day, due to the temperature (it was 52'C) we had to stay in shaded areas and water areas to cool off as some of use suffered a minor heat stroke, but we managed to cool off and just float around the rest of the day to end it.Well coming to the problems/issues faced:1 - It's located at the back of palm island. There's no way to walk to it. Only way is a monorail (which costs around 25-35 AED return I heard), or taxi, I took a tram to the Mall of Emirates and then a taxi, and it cost around 45 AED from there to the Park, on the way back it was 35 AED, probably due to the route.2. It's super hot! The weather does not get to you but the tiles/stones in the park are scorching hot!! Bring Sandles for everybody or you will be hopping around shaded areas or water, the water park has put some mats on bridges only to protect your feet, but they havnt everywhere, and it's to promote and sell their overpriced branded footwear.Alot of reviews say you have to leave Sandles etc! It's what's put me off taking them, but when I was at the park, I discovered that you can wear your Sandles on your hands like gloves before getting on any ride to take them with you, any other object/footwear will have to be left behind, and collected later on. The park charges about 120-180 AED per pair of Sandles, which is crazy considering you can get them from any local market for <10 AED.3. Take a water bottle with you, drink as much as you can, and stay hydrated, long queues halfway through the day can cause health problems, as I mentioned we suffered a minor heat stroke and managed to control it, however food is not permitted into the park itself and will be confiscated with a through bag search per person. The park has restaurants on the inside and outside, I did not manage to go to them so I cannot give an opinion of them.However there is options to get fluids/drinks around, there is 1 stall I recommend near the Neptune tower, or well any that had a 50 AED refill container, they provide you with a bottle which you can pay between 5-12 AED for a refill, which is the cheapest option available! Do not go for the snow cones, they are amazing but aslong as your happy to pay for it 50-70 AED per cup... the refill options saves alot and you can get a not so nice looking snow cone, but hey... its to cool you.. not to be pretty.. and it melts almost instant so eat it fast! And do not leave any water on the benches, even in the shade! By the time you are back they are boiling, and worse case If you need to cool off go to nearby bathrooms, as they have air conditioning and the tapwater is filtered for dubai and clean.4. You normally have a paper band on the arm with a barcode similar to another park, it allows you to make purchases or products and you have to top it off at the entrance, apparantly any money left on at the end of the day gets refunded (be careful you may have to queue up for it,) on the day I went, their systems were down.. which was very problematic as i had to walk 10-15 minutes to go from where I am, to locker rooms near the entrance and collect coins/notes and take it to the stall, any change i'd have to take back and go back to where I was with family. So do make sure their systems are not down when you go.5. The big thing I have not seen anywhere on any review so far.. The > LOCKERS <. There are 2 sizes, small and large, I managed to take pictures of them below. Small costs about 50 AED large was i believe 75 AED, and there's a special offer with a towel for an extra 10 AED If i remember right. These prices are crazy and non refundable. You'll manage to fit 1, backpack, 1 pair of shoes and maybe a wallet or 2, and that's it. Also the locker unlock is only given to 1 person, so going in a family, you'll have to either go together or buy seperate lockers.6. Photographs at the end, this isn't a problem, just stating the costs, 100 AED for 1 photo and 350 AED for 15. Which I'm not sure.. but when I visited the burj khalifa they were only going to give you 1 printed and the rest either on usb/online In the higher price.7. I recommend everybody to buy the waterproof plastic cases for their phones, I never noticed this till halfway through the day, but it protects your phone and allows you to take pictures on the go! :D just make sure you don't drop it on the slide down lol! I'm not sure how much these cost.. but I bet they will be extortionately priced, but worth it for your own pictures as its one of my regrets I did not manage to get many.8. They I believe rent out go pro cameras near the inside of the park entrance after enter past the checkers, on your right side, I missed this, not sure on the cost of this but it's there.Besides the downsides and problems on the day... it was a lovely and amazing time and I'm glad I went, oh and it's free to enter the park of you have a room at the Atlantis hotel. There are many other activities such as zip lining, scuba diving, aquarium, these however are at an additional cost, ranging from 100-400 AED (guessing.)Hope you all have an amazing day here, it's well worth it, and it will take the whole day, and you will be drained in the evening. Don't forget the slippers! You have been warned."

A split vote on which was the best but it's a shoot out between Leap of Faith and Zoomaranga. Wait times were short although again maybe the time of year and heat.

You can buy a ticket with a meal deal but this limits you to the choice of food so I recommend just purchasing your ticket for the waterpark to allow you a choice of all the foods on offer.Superb day for the family and the children and adults will not ever be bored."

When friends come to visit and you need some downtime for a few hours Aquaventure is right up there on my list of things to do. Not only does it offer great slides (The Tower of Poseidon has a bunch of excellent rides) but the views from the top offer a unique view of the Palm, one of Dubai's most iconic landmarks.It's expensive but if you've made the conscious choice to visit Dubai you'll find it in keeping with pretty much everything else and it's a great way to spend a few hours and it's not just for kids."

We had a three day stop over in Dubai en-route to Sri Lanka, and this was on the to do list.Great place to spend the day, has just enough rides to keep you and you're kids entertained. We combined this with a visit to The Lost Chambers Aquarium.The lazy river was really good fun, had lots of side routes, escalators, rapids as well as the obligatory water fountains. The rides were really good too, especially the family ones. Have been to a fair few water parks, being a big kid at heart, and loved every minute of this.Went end of July and was not busy, hardly any queues to speak of but the queuing layout suggested this could get take a LOT more people!!The food was OK, felt they could have done more than they had on offer, but they have to appeal to the masses and get the food out fast, so take it for what it is.The drinks though are extortionate, at 15 AED each, nearly \u00a33 a bottle, was a bit steep. Would suggest taking a locker, to keep your stuff secure, does cost 70 AED, but for the day, worth the piece of mind.My two daughters absolutely loved it, and if visiting Dubai, you have to do this."

There are lifeguards everywhere so felt very safe and looked after at all times.

The big water slide there is terrifyingly awesome, the multi-passenger rides are guaranteed to induce a few giggles amongst friends, and the lazy rivers are endless. It is one of the best waterparks in the region and there is a lot of competition for that title. Now a few negative comments which are not the end of the world. 1.) you cannot park at the hotel if you are just going to the waterpark. You have to park at a nearby car park and take the hotel shuttle. They leave regularly enough,(15 to 20 minutes - but that seems like a lifetime when you're hot and all you want to do is go have some fun. 2.) The concessions are ridiculously priced, and you can expect to overpay for a burger or a hot dog, but who cares? You're too busy having a great time... Now despite having a small children's' area, this is NOT a place for young kids. If you're children are not capable swimmers, do not take them... This is one of the must-visit attractions in Dubai and I would highly recommend it. p.s change rooms, and rentable lockers are available"

The Tower of Neptune is the closer one to the hotel and features the leap of faith which is a steep drop which takes you through the aquarium in a glass tube at the bottom. The second tower, the tower of Poseidon, features the other top ride Poseidon's revenge. You enter a glass tube and the floor falls away, dropping you for what seemed like ages before you turn in the water. Staff are superb, but be warned the ground is hot so have some form of water shoes. Some rides do not allow selfie sticks or Go Pro buoyancy handles. The lazy river features rapids and a couple of rides and is a great way to see out an hour. Only negative was that the Slitherine ride made your back feel as if you had friction burns as you went down it, very unpleasant and not worth it. You can use the lazy river to get from one tower to the other , or use the hotel golf carts which run along the beachside. Have a great time"

Invest in a pair of waterproof shoes though as the ground is soooooo hot when you walk around the park and trust me when I say it's hot!- u can leave the shoes where u get into the river but a couple had their shoes nicked(probably by people who hadn't got shoes and will have dumped them once they had got to their sun beds)There are a lot of lifeguards about and they are all very friendly and very helpful/ the river can be a bit boisterously at times so safety is huge.I had a good time here but be prepared for lots of people."

It takes a bit of careful advanced planning, but to break a long haul flight that had a long wait in Dubai we opted to get out of the airport and have a few hours of fun at this great water park. Before doing this, there are important things to remember: pack a towel, good sunscreen, shorts and swimwear into your carry on luggage. Work out approx travel times to and from airport. Don't forget queuing times to get into park and allow yourself time to eat (at airport, as park is way overpriced for food), you are not allowed bring food into the park. Also DO NOT pre purchase your tickets at the airport as it took almost 45mins for them to recognise and validate them at the park and it's far far quicker to just pay at the entrance. Ok so that sounds like a lot to sort out and plan, however it actually just needs a careful bit of time management and it all went brilliantly. The water park is incredible fun, with a great mix of adrenaline rides like leap of faith and one in a capsule drop, to equally fun and relaxed meandering river rides. Over all the queues weren't too bad however it was mid week when we were there. I would highly recommend a visit and after a fun filled day and shower you arrive back in time refreshed for your on bound flight. Would definitely do it again."

Went to Aquaventure for the second time in March 2016 having previously been in 2012 and had a great day.We arrived early so we could avoid the queues and got our wrist bands along with a wrist band for a locker. When I tried to use this wrist band on a locker it did not work and took around 20 minutes to fix and involved me standing in 2 queues, so this wasn't the best start to the day.Once this was cleared up we got into the park and went on to enjoy our day on the flumes and in the river Rapids. Since our last visit a new tower had been built with new flumes, which was a pleasant surprise to us and made our day in the water even more enjoyable.On a side note, our towels were removed/ stolen from our sun beds twice. This was frustrating as we had to convince the guy at the stall twice to provide us with replacements, which took time to begin with. Not sure what can be done to stop this but be wary leaving expensive sun glasses or items lying around. We were always told Dubai was safe but this gave us a few doubts and concerns.This was a slight dampener on what is without a doubt a fantastic water park."

Is a very big place, kind of expensive, and be mentally prepared to walk a lot! The las week of the season, you might found many attractions closed. So plan ahead. They also have family packages were you can find yourself with a private tent, a welcome fruit basket, juices and private pool chairs for 4 members. If you want your space and privacy, you will pay for these. Also, dont forget your go-pro like camera, and sunscreen!"

This one is great, but the rides are much like other parks, so my boys (10 and 12) weren't particularly impressed with the rides but they were happy to be at a water park. We visited during a low season, so to speak. It was super hot so staying in the water was perfect to help stay cool. Carrying our flip flops on every ride was a little annoying but necessary because the ground was too hot to walk on between rides. Bring water shoes. We bought some for the kids because it was too much to ask them to hold on to their shoes. We liked most of the lazy river but there were parts closed for various reasons. We stayed at Atlantis so going back and forth to the hotel was a perk. Because it was so hot, it would've been nice if free water to drink was available. There are two water fountains, each in front of the two eating places, but there really out of the way. The cost to get in, plus the cost of a bottle of water is really asking a lot in stroke heated weather. Sunscreen is a must! After water and sunscreen is taken care of...the rest is great! Have fun."

Situated at Atlantis the Palm, exactly center of the Crescent of this wonderful man-made-island of Palm Jumeirah, a hidden paradise was known as one of the best tourist attraction in Dubai and that is Aquaventure!Good for the kids as there was this section called Splashers where they can definitely have a great time. If you are brave enough, don't ever leave the place without trying the tallest water slides in UAE called Leap-of-Faith. Not so sure with the measurement but one thing is for sure - you will be getting the experience just in 3 seconds! They have got pool and beach were you can both do sun-bathing. Sun loungers are every where. Towel service was also free. They have got food gazebos where you can buy your snacks and value for money was fairly reasonable. And most of all, life guards and staffs are all friendly and warm.If you are planning to get a summer escapade, you better visit this place same as we did! We enjoyed the water slides and we indeed had a wonderful time!"

The enjoyment of the rides at the end make it worth the wait! (Went on Leap of Faith 3 times! It's a 5 second slide and I waited 30 minutes every time!)A lot of lifeguards around, smiling and greeting you and ready to help and answer questions. Alcohol is not served there.Food is a little bit overpriced. ex; 100$ for a bucket of 24 piece chicken. Even a bottle of water or soda is expensive and it is strictly forbidden to bring your own food or drinks.In the end, I would really recommend this waterpark, you won't regret it.

Kids shorter than that? Then aquaventure is e best bet. The difference is the raft ride around the park. Wild wadi has great slides, is compact but the raft ride isn't as good as the one at aquaventure. Kids of all ages and sizes can go around this ride with an adult.If you aren't already at the hotel, park at the monorail car park at the start of the palm and use that to get to the park. Shorter walk and better views than driving to the hot car park and getting the shuttle bus. Or get a cab if your nerves can take it.Expect a very expensive day. If you plan on using the park more than once, seriously consider staying at the hotel. It may be cheaper in the long run."

There were plenty of sun loungers, towels were free to guests but could be hired. The food halls are great and fairly reasonable. Toilets clean and well placed. Definitely take flip flops as the floor is burning hot- you can hold them on all the rides. If you take a 'Go-Pro' camera you need a hand strap- they do not allow the long handle on the rides.

The summer discovery deal offered general admission, meal deal and admission to lost chambers for 335aed each. Our party was keen to undertake couple of activities - zip line (which we found out in arrival was not operating!), shark safari and stingray feeding. We could not however book these at the general admissions desk but had to book at TIKI hut in the park. Unfortunately staff could not be precise about the opening time (12:45) and thus meant we kept going to check and wasted a bit of time. If you want to do any of the activities be at the hut early, as very limited places. We were fortunate that those who wanted to feed the stingrays all got a place but only one of our party got the shark safari. Both activities were very enjoyable and a unique experience the divers / instructors for both were excellent and provided a short presentation and safety brief prior to the experience.The meal deal is a good option. There is not an extensive menu but includes chicken or hamburgers, chicken pieces and vegetarian option. Chips and choice of drink. It is cooked to ordered so fresh and very hot. The deal itself saved us 270 AED. We chose to locate ourselves towards the back of the park, this meant we right beside the lazy river, barracuda restaurant and 5 slides. There are also changing facilities and lockers rooms there too so you do not need to use the ones at the park entrance. The rides are great (probably better than wild wadi, particularly those travelling with teenagers etc). The guest transfer buggies are great especially if you are not wearing flip flops in temperatures >40 degrees! The park should consider adopting the path sprays which cool down the concern ate and make it bearable to walk. Many rides are off shoots from the lazy river and Rapids so little waking. However the rides at the back of the park (4-5) do require you to walk up a number of flights of stairs albeit it is shaded. Some amazing views from the tip of leap of faith and the capsule drop ride (can\u2019t remember it's name) a must do ride!"

I thought we were going to be ripped off the way we generally are everywhere else (AED18 for a soft drink is rather high), but we were pleasantly surprised (actually we couldn't finish the food...).I think the whole \"sliding through the shark tank\" marketing pitch is somewhat over played.

It's not a huge park and they have a few rivers around the main tower. From the main tower they have probably around 6 slides, so not many. But I would say it's pretty fun place to spend a day if you don't have too many expectations from a park with many slides. If anything I would do the diving with sharks, but it's probably very overpriced like everything else there."

As it was a part of our package, we visited it everyday of our stay and had a gala time. Rides are unique and very safe. Plenty of snack bars and a food court helped us keep our glucose levels high. 'The leap of faith' will surely get your adrenaline rushing. It is also a great place for photography as this park offers some amazing backgrounds."

My only observation, and if you're reading this review apparently others have written this, you must wear water shoes. If you take your thongs (jandles/flip flops) you will need to leave them at the waters edge, once you have glided along in the inner tube you come out somewhere quite different and need to walk across the burning lava of pavement to find them again! Oh my goodness blisters, burning ...running and ahhhh water.Lockers are available to store expensive items, towels can also be provided although I'm not sure if you pay for this as we just grabbed a couple from the hotel."

Most of the rides you go on single and double doughnut floaties and I got to ride many more things then expected. The rides were friendly and \"mild\" but for those enjoying more action there are slides for you as well. Everything inside the park food/beverages is expensive so be prepared. One downside being that Dubai is very hot were the showers near the pools containing hot water and only the only way to cool down was inside restaurants. (Pools are generally warm due to the heat) During our visit I saw to grown woman needing medical care because of the heat so aerea's with outside fans maybe would help or more golfcarts transporting guest around.

From activities for children to the more tough people, it has everything. The lagoon ride with torrent and waves to the Leap of Faith and the Chute at Poseidon's Revenge. However, pre-book on the internet for some discount and be early as then it gets too crowded. The waiting period for each ride is almost 30 mins which spoils the fun. The management needs to distribute the crowd somehow, especially a time bound allotment for the popular rides. Do remember to carry ur footwear at all times as when you move from one ride to the other, the hot ground blisters your feet. Happy Fun Time"

After taking the metro, tram and then the monorail, we finally reached, checked in, got into our swimming costumes, purchased locker and went inside the park. Guess what? We were rejected from doing any of the rides bcz we werent wearing the right type of costume. Me and my wife were both in random cotton tshirts and shorts so we were rejected as the park only accepted proper swimming costumes or any other clothe made of SILK and POLYESTER only. This was fine, it should be rather like this for the safety. But the best part is here, the guy told us there is a shop inside the park where you can go and purchase the right type of costume. I went there and guess what, a swimming costume for female (the one that covers the entire body) costed TWICE more than the park entrance ticket. It costed AED 520, I was shocked and liked, are you serious???? I had my slippers broken so I had to buy a basic flip flop which costed me AED 80 (again, are you serious). Anyway, I did not have enough cash or credit cards to pay that crazy hefty amount (and who would) so I went to the main entrance and asked for refund whcih was refused but they allowed me entry on the next day with the right costume. I went to one of the malls and bought the same type of swimming costime for under AED 100.This is seriously not acceptable, LOOTING money from your customers for items like costumes. The next day, we enjoyed a lot, the park is great with services and all."

The park was fantastic, We arrived at 10 am and stayed until the end, leaving at 7 pm. What a day, excellent memories for all of us, from several trips on the lazy rivers/rapids/etc. to the slides and topped off with the Dolphins, exception day had by all. It has to be a must for a family day. Comment - takes more than one day to see everything, people have recommended staying in the Atlantis for one night and doing the park over 2 days.

Living in Dubai & so much to do, we dont appreciate some of the awesome places to see here. Aquaventure being one.Few tips - 1. Dubai is a Sunny, city and in summer you get best deals to hotels & parks. So plan ahead and enjoy these outings.2. Be there early in the day, as you have so much to and if you wish to enjoy most rides, one full day is not enough3. Bundle your Aquaventure with Dolphin Encounters, Shark tank dive etc. Of course these blow your wallet, but these are once in a lifetime encounters.4. Take suncream, a small towel (if you use Dolphin Encounters, you get free Towel - which you can keep with you for entire day. Also at the Dolphin Encounter, you get free water - so pick up as many bottles as can, you will need plenty of water5. Avoid taking any Jewellery or precious stuff, as lockers are available, but depending on where you are - got to walk towards them. You have lockers at Entrance and at Barracuda restaurant6. Plenty of food available at restaurants in Barracudas. They are marginally expensive - but as you are not allowed outside food, not much of choice. You have options from Pizza, Arabic, Indian, Burgers etc and Ice Cream too7. Leap of Faith is a must do, though the queue can be long. Took 75 minutes for me. Its more frightening to see people plunging down, but the actual experience is not8. Aquacondo and Zoomerango are awesome experience for families. But if you have kids make sure they are above 1.2 Metres which is minimum height for most rides9. The kids lagoon is exceptional and MUST DO if you have kids. Here there are no height or age limitations10. Get Flip Flops as floor is hot and cannot walk barefoot. For kids Aquashoes - so they can swim and walk, when required11. Slitherine is awesome waterslides. I did not try it, as there was a long queue. You need to take your own water tube - plenty of them available. Saw people were very excited and some were repeating it12. Poseidon\u2019s Revenge - Did not have the courage to try and heard is the most exciting. Probably next time13. I noticed many guests wearing a plastic pouch on their neck and dangling their mobile phones inside. Think its sold in Aquanventure - handly for those who cannot live without clicking pics from their mobiles & not bothered with them getting wet"

Poseidon's revenge is probably the scariest thing there. You stand in a capsule, waiting for the floor beneath you to fall out, at which point you feel the full force of gravity and accelerate incredibly fast in a near vertical drop. Watching others disappear and start screaming while waiting your turn doesn't help either.For the less adventurous there are also chilled out rides like river rapids and you can book a dolphin adventure. If doing the dolphin adventure then it's best to have someone in your group who is not participating so they can take photos for you. There is an official photographer but the prices for the photos are sky high."

Be prepared to buy a small bottle for water for 10+ dhs (10 times the retail price) if you need to. Best not to go on weekends as it gets really busy. You can also buy the tickets online 2 days before the visit at a discount. If you have a residency, with your EID, you can get a discount for each EID presented.Enjoy!"

            "review": "Great day out in Ramadan!. For future reference, going to Aquaventure within the month of Ramadan is the best time as there aren't any queues or they are very short.Far fewer visitors frequent this attraction plus there are amazing discounts for GCC residents and those staying at the hotel. We normally stay as a family in a regular room, go early on the first day and leave our luggage with the concierge inside the hotel. This maximises your time at the park! Take your time to look at a map of the park as you go in to decide where to put your towels etc. There are lots of umbrellas and trees to provide shade and there are sun loungers pretty much everywhere. Obviously if you have very young children, you are going to need to grab a lounger near the enormous kids area. Watch out for the tipping bucket of water, it's quite a force and may frighten young kids. Not surprisingly, the summer months make the paving round the water slides etc very hot. Either take your flip flops with you on every ride and tie them onto your rubber donut as you go round or invest in rubber sole water socks. If you need to take a bag into the park, make sure it's a small rucksack and it will fit into the small size lockers. There is a big size, but it isn't worth the extra cost. Beware the fact that you can either pay to get into your locker once or as many times as you wish - different cost! There is also a deal that includes a locker with towels, or you can be cheap and bring your own like we did!Note that there is a rule saying no food allowed into the park and the security will check each bag as you enter. However, it does say that you are allowed to bring a 1litre bottle of water per person. The food options once inside are ok, nothing to write home about though. There are lots of kiosks selling a variety of drinks, ice creams and typical fast food such as burgers and pizza.It really is a great day out for all, big and small!"

The parking and shuttle service worked well. We ended up waiting in the ticket line as long the people who didn't book online, that was a bit frustrating. I took a locker and a towel, the locker with the bracelet is very convenient. The park was not busy at all and there was no long lines for the rides. I had so much fun floating around in the lazy river for half of the day! We had lunch at barracuda and people there were super friendly.Overall an awesome day and I will go back again!"

Having visited many waterparks in the USA and Siam Park Tenerife, this waterpark simply does not compare. Yes it was all the rides you would expect, the vertical drop 'leap of faith' and the lazy river but every ride felt short and not really of the high standard you expect from Dubai. Positives were the food, very affordable, tasty and you get plenty of it. Lockers and towels are available to hire and there is plenty of room to chill and soak up the sun. Because of the heat in July the park was quiet so we didn't really have to queue but if you did there is plenty of shade to avoid the sun."

Because it was free and we were rushed for time, we only spent around four hours here, but you could very easily spend at least a day, especially with kids. The waterslides were of varying excitement levels, from small kids to super brave adults. Whilst there was no way in the world you would get me on some of them, that wasn't because I didn't think they were safe...the park is well designed and well maintained, and I don't imagine there's many injuries.The extra facilities are also superb, with more than adequate sitting/lying areas, and high quality beach towels readily available.We didn't eat at the park, but I snuck a look at some prices and they are astronomical. Not sure if you can sneak your own food in, but if you can it would definitely be advised."

We thought the water park was fantastic, with life guards everywhere which gave reassurance.But, when we were on the water rapids and the lazy river with our daughter, who was in the child seat ring with her dad. We noticed there was alot of loose floating rings, which became a problem. On the lazy river they started to back up which restored in other trying to throw them out the way, which then came over our heads. On the water rapids a empty double ring crashed into my partners ring, which also had my daughter in, causing them to tip over into the fast rapid water. This was a horrendous experience. As I watched this happen I jumped out of my ring and luckily enough my partner had hold of our daughter but they where both shaken up, my daughter was hysterical and all in all a terrifying experience for us all. My partner had fell Into to the floor with such force his elbow ended up in a huge bruise. Thank God our daughter is good at controlling her breath under water, had a swim float on and is able to swim. We noticed very small children in the child seats with their parents, who didn't have any floats/life jackets on. We couldn't help but imagine what would have happend if it was a smaller child who couldn't swim.We really think that the water park should look at providing stations where u can obtain and return the rings because in our opinion having empty floats in the water is dangerous. Other than that everything about the water park was great.Just expressing our concern from our experience ."

Shark attack is my favourite ride and travelling through the Sharks and Ray's never gets dull.

The \"lazy river\" is very relaxing but for more excitement, grab a single or double inflatable dinghy and head down the Torrents or the Rapids. They're fun! There are two main areas where the water slides are located meaning there is not a great amount of walking to do between the slides in each area. We went during Ramadan so the park wasn't very busy which was great news for queuing! We didn't queue for any longer than around 5 minutes! The floor is scorching hot so please remember to take some flip-flops with you. They are much easier than sandals and you can hold them too as you go down the slides.

River rapids with mostly flat waves that go for around 2km long, with exits to rides.So you need strong arms and back to carry on to the end.More water pressure is needed to carry you around the circular river course.Both towers have thrilling and quite exhilarating rides, that will surely get your heart racing.Free leisure pool and beach, with views of Dubai marina and the Atlantis. Zip line is a great additional activity with extra fees. A chance to view Dubai and Atlantis from the top.But shame it was closed for our second time of attendance. I think zip line open on the weekends.Dolphin bay is a fun experience again with additional charge. Is expensive but it's quite memorable for the children. Good professional photo opportunity. In peak season leave before closing time to avoid 2 hour taxi wait! Overall an exciting day activity that keeps you cool in the Dubai weather"

We got there early morning and there was hardly anyone there! No queueing at all! It did get busier as the day progressed but man did we time our visit well! All the bad reviews about it being too busy and not getting to enjoy the park due to the loooong wait time were non-existent for us when we visited in mid-June. I can imagine the enjoyment of the park would be compromised having to wait ages for the awesome slides! The one where you hop in the enclosure (plastic coffin) and then you get dropped 35m was a standout for me....might not be everyones cuppa, though!Bad points?.....The food / drink is a bit of a rip off tbh and if I understand right, you can't bring in your own snacks. Well played...they know you'll be staving after running around all day! The entry cost was also a tad steep, but once you find out just how many lifeguards they have in there (one every 10m it seemed!,) you understand they have to cover all their staff costs!So if you're travelling through Dubai during Ramadan, make sure this is on your list!"

You are able to get printed and digital photos of your experience.

So much fun! Was a touch on the expensive side for entry, but worth it. If it helps, you can catch the Metro to Dubai Marina and catch a tram to the Palm monorail to get to the entrance. Cost was approx 30AED for monorail. Suggest, if you have more than 2 people or a family - best to get catch a metro to a close station (Dubai Marina, Internet City etc) and just taxi it from there."

            "review": "First time ever experience of a water park. Great place to start!!. So I'd never actually set foot in a water park before. Until I spent the weekend at The Palm Atlantis. I kinda thought it would be fun to try and experience a water park, before my mind thought it too late, at the age of 47 with my 48 year old boyfriend, I donned a newly purchased one-piece swimsuit and braved the heat, water and general public. I did not regret this for one single second! I was pretty rubbish at first, not knowing how to get into a rubber ring to enjoy the slow flowing river ride, which was actually a great introduction into what a water park actually looked like! Once we'd done a full lap of the place we jumped out of the ring, yes - jumped! Then we wandered off to adventures new. When I say adventure I had no idea what I was actually about to experience. Walking to the top of an old looking inca style tower, I unknowingly decided to experience a vertical style drop which I kinda dropped vertically for a little while, then shot me through a tube then fired me into a splash pool where my journey ended and I was then able to open my eyes. I've since found out this was the Leap of Faith from the Tower of Neptune. Still giggling, we climbed back up the Tower of Neptune and wanted to try another ride but unfortunately we didn't have one of the inflatables with us to partake so decided to leave the tower. My boyfriend, sensibly, realised it would be quicker to exit via the leap of faith, once more, instead of walking down all of those stairs. Of course it's quicker! Why didn't I think of that? Because I'm a 47 year old woman that's why! Anyway, yes, I did it again but this time I managed to keep my eyes open for about 3 seconds longer than previous and still didn't take in much of the views as I zoomed passed, laughing so much cos I couldn't believe that I'd done that flipping thing again in the space of 10 minutes!We then decided to walk to another tall structure because, obviously, that will probably be where another crazy ride would be. You know, the higher you go, the longer you'll drop. With a ride that sealed you into a capsule, counted down, then the floor gave way from beneath your feet. Yeah, that one. It's called Poseiden's Adventure and I'm sure that this ride was meant for middle aged ladies who were water park virgins to actually let them know exactly how water parks should be. Well it started and I tried to keep my eyes open but I was laughing so flipping much that by the time I finished, ending up flinging down a long straight chute, I'd missed it. I'm sure I did a loop-the-loop at some point though. Our last ride, cos we were heading to meet friends for Brunch in the hotel, was going to be a bit of an easier experience, because we were in a queue alongside a group of kids, on the Zoomarango. It wasn't easier but it was equally as thrilling and fun as both of the individual rides I'd experienced. The kids were all great but I think us two oldies giggled and screamed a tiny bit more than they did.I'm dying to return. It's a great day out and thrilling experience for all ages. Try it!"

This year we had to pay for these things separately which obviously we didn't know as we were going from what happened last year. Park busy and one ride closed due to staff training but we all had a good time. I think guests should be aware they need to pay extra for towels and lockers on top of the ticket price or at least let them know to bring their own towels as if a family all need lockers this all adds up."

I made friends with one of the floatations tubes provided by the park for free, which you use to ride on the various types of adventures. There were Rapids and waves and waterfalls and a hectic tube ride. My brave boys did a very long free fall 'drop'. There are so many helpful and friendly staff and the lifesaving team are superb!!!

The changing \\shower rooms, lockers were excellent. Totally privacy and no rushing. My partner paid a small amount to enter the area we were in and take photos. I would advise non swim family\\friends paying this as they will have a great view of the action and can take photos of you with dolphins. The free public viewing is not close to the Royal Swim and photos will not be good. In the water for about 45 minutes, you don't need to be a great swimmer just be confidant in the water."

Our hotel reception just issued us with tickets on the day. There is a shuttle bus which can take you to Aquaventure on the Palm however we got a taxi, it didn't cost a lot. There are some great rides here, although being a wimp I let my boyfriend go on most of them. He loved the Tower of Neptune and Poseidon\u2019s Revenge the most. Poseidon\u2019s Revenge is a water slide where you are basically dropped into darkness. Not for me at all, but there is a mixture of slides in The tower of Poseidon and I went on most of them so even if you are a wimp you get to enjoy the day too. I also did the Zip slide but it wasn't worth the money to be honest, the views were the top of peoples head and the beach - it was a little boring. Lazy river was fun but once you have done it there is no need to go on it again. All in all a great day out, broke up the day especially as it was raining."

We are glad we did it especially my daughters and also we are glad we did it only for a day and not longer. It is a very crowded waterpark mostly by day visitors however it has the space and various options. Still you have to wait 10-20 mins for the best rides. I would recommend the lazy river and its currents as a starter and in between rides as many other reviewers suggest and it gets better after 3-4 pm. So if you are staying at the hotel might make sense to do other things and then visit for a few hours each day. In terms of how they organised the general area and food offering and also safety I was positively surprised. Would recommend for a day or two if you have young children or teens."

We were not staying at the Atlantis hotel, so we arrived at the parking lot at 10 am and a bus took us to a bus stop but we didn't know where to go from there. Since it was our first time there and there wasn't anyone leading the group, we followed the crowd from the same bus and they walked to the entrance of the shopping area which leads to the water park. The queues had already begun but the waiting times was reasonable because they had many booths to keep up with the crowd. And all the screens and signs are good to read while you're waiting at the queue because it gives you ideas about the packages and which type of ticket you need to purchase. The bathrooms and locker rooms and changing rooms were clean. Some people needed help with using the electronic lockers and when they asked the lady who works there to help she just pointed at the machine and left without explaining. So another girl helped. It really makes a big difference when people working in a foreign country have a good attitude with a guest. It leaves a very good impression of the place and experience. They needed more ladies to keep the bathrooms and showers cleaner because its a large area and usually very busy. More needs to be explained about the money saved in the bands and how they could be used and some tickets which include meals are on paper receipts instead of saved on the band. We had the issue of going on rides then to eat but they asked for the slips and no one would walk around with paper slips at a waterpark while on rides etc. although our bands had mentioned meals included. And which type of package we had.Other than that, everything was nice. It got very crowded fast but we left early enough to avoid the afternoon crowd as more people were arriving. They had small shops all around and they had spray tattoo booths at a few places. And a go pro renting booth. Good experience would go again and always try to be there when they first open and leave before it gets too crowded. But for those who don't mind, going anytime is good. Weekdays and weekends are always packed because it is Dubai and people visit it all year round. They have managed to get tourists from all over the world. And they are trying their best to provide everything to keep everyone entertained."

Points to note 1 We went during Ramadan so no queues at all for anything 2 wear pool shoes, the ground is boiling hot (you will have to put them on your hands for some rides to stop you getting caught) 3 Rash vest is good but T shirts need to be removed for some rides due to friction 4 Kids under 1.2M will not be able to do many rides.

It can be expensive to get in, although we went during Ramadan, so they offered discounted tickets and it wasn't busy.You can rent a locker for the day which costs \u00a38 (non refundable)The slides were all brilliant, whether riding the single riders, doubles or group rides. All great if over 1.2 metres. The lazy river is nice, particularly in 45 degree hit, but be warned there are different turns in it, and some take you on to Rapids and also back up to some of the slides. We had 6 hours in the park and I think we did everything. The food is good, but you will pay around \u00a311 for a kids meal and between \u00a311-\u00a314 for a adult (drink included). You can load this into your wrist band at the entrance kiosk to save carrying cash.There are lots of loungers and a towel can be rented for \u00a32.There are golf buggies which drive around the path way for guests to jump on and off to get between the rides.In the heat you will definitely need footwear to get around, which you can take on the ride with you, you just need to hold on to them! All in all a brilliant day out for a family in a great location.We wanted to go and have a look at the Atlantis Palm with a view to bringing our children, but security prevent none guests from entering."

It can get crowded at times making it difficult to find chairs near the pool/lazy river. The price is also a little high (and food inside the park is also expensive)."

The food was delicious and we had an amazing time.Tips for first timers:- Leave everything in the locker, bring towel and nobody touch your stuff so you can leave them on a chair near lazy river and get back to it whenever you're back.-You can wear your flip flops to most rides, and it's better that you do. My brother left his by the lazy river and kept hopping in between the rides (The ground gets pretty hot). Needles to say when we get back he fond his same place he left them.- There are very few rides that GoPro are not allowed -for your own safety of course- and lazy river will get you to all rides across the park which is fun of it's own. - Between AquaConda and Zoomerango - Zoomerango will pump more Adrenalin to your vain. - Leap of Faith is free fall experience for those of you who dare to try it.- Poseidon's Revenge is not as scary as it looks. (Still pretty thrilling) - For beach still prefer Jumeirah Beach.Not a fan of heights or darkness I tried all the rides and It is the scariest most crazy thing I've done in my life.Will I do it again?

River is for lazy people (like me), small to large rides for beginners to experts, family to groups, kids to grandparents. I loved the part that u dont need to walk or climb much as travelators are installed all across and u can be seated on ur tubes and feel lazy to even go to rideCrowd-as name itself, u can expect some good amount of decent crowd generally families and couples. Price-We got it for deal but even if u buy it at full price, it worthFood-Most of the cuisine options (I loved pizza and south Indian)Tips-Get ur wrist bend loaded with money for food to avoid carrying cash insideOverall a must watch attraction of Dubai"

Not many know this but, there is a private beach that is accessible from the water park. Enjoy the evening there after a tiring day at the park. Visit the lost chambers if you find time. It is adjacent to aquaventure and is a huge aquarium.Have a great holiday! :)"

The waterpark itself is huge!! There are so many slides we didn't actually get a chance to go on all of them because we didn't get to the waterpark until about 3pm. It closes at 7pm so I would definitely say to make the most of your day here to arrive around 12pm. The lazy river was great, staff take pictures of you whilst you are going around so is funny to check them out at the end of the day on your way out to see how silly you look :D There is access to the beach at the waterpark as well so if wanting to chill out from all the fun of the waterslides there is a nice relaxing beach too.

If you wear flip flops some rides don't allow them and it's hard to get back to your footwear after the ride. You can buy swim shoes there, they cost around \u00a325. We wore sports socks which made do but I've now bought swim shoes from eBay for our next trip.2. Most rides put you back in the lazy river.3. There is no special place to collect rings. Just look for the sun lounger area and random rings will float pass. By 2pm there are lots of spare rings accompanying you on the lazy river. This could be improved by collecting of the rings by the staff. 4. You cannot ride in a double ring on your own. 5. When you arrive just join the lazy river. Which is FANTASTIC we spent about 4 hours going round.6. The signs are poor. Just look for the tower as most rides start there.7. Be prepared to queue to get in. Once through though queuing is minimal. "

Can only compare this to wild wadi which is its most direct competition and they are both excellent and both do some things better than the other. Aquaventure is bigger so there is more walking and potentially more queuing and be warned that in the summer you will need something to wear on your feet as you go around the park as the concrete gets very hot! The river parts here are longer and more interesting/varied than wild wadi but the escalators are dull and add nothing to the experience. This has more rides and has more rides with bigger drops but overall the ride experiences are shorter so you will spend more time queuing than riding. Great day out but better if done while staying at Atlantis so you can visit several times."

They also check your bags at the door for food (and I'm sure other things) so don't try to carry in or it will go to waste.

We had a nice area by the water and the shade kept us cool all day. The only thing i felt edissapointed with was the food, we ate at the Barracuda and although clean i did feel that the quality of the food was poor for the price paid.

As hotel guests we could access the waterpark via the resort buggies and never had to queue to enter. Towel stations were in handy locations and we were able to set up base before spending hours enjoying the park.Safety of the visitors comes across as paramount and there are numerous life guards stationed at every point who have no hesitation in either enforcing the park\u2019s safety rules or jumping into the water if they see something untoward. Virtually all were smiley and friendly and gave us the impression that your safety was their first concern.Not sure if the water is salty or heavily chlorinated but our eyes did suffer, or maybe we just spent way too long lazing around the lazy river!"

We arrived early but there were still big queues and the staff were not very helpful. We really enjoyed the day and the rides, but some of the queues were quite long. The food was quite expensive and poor quality fast food, I had expected something better. The changing facilities left a lot to be desired. When we left at the end of the day there was a massive queue for taxis. We took the monorail off the palm and then got a taxi, probably worth doing. We felt a bit ripped off but did have a lot of fun and stayed there the whole day. I think I enjoyed the wild wadi just as much and it is probably better value for money."

One fault would be that the floors get so hot and if you go on the lazy river and come off somewhere else and you haven't taken your water shoes on, you will scald your feet. Me and my children were in tears running for each small area of shade to try and locate our original seat and shoes. Get some water shoes or take your flip flopsOn with you. Perhaps the park should make this suggestion or put some parasols in areas to make it more bearable to walk without foot protection from the lazy river/Rapids even with white slabs, 43 degrees are going to severely burn feet."

            "review": "A fun day out with the family (with some caveats). Visited Aquaventure with my wife and 3 young children on a Thursday. We had booked on line but it still came to 1700 Dirham which was steep, especially when you add in the cost of renting towels and lockers. I am not a big fan of water parks and would have rated it a \"3\" but I have to be fair and say my wife and kids loved it and said it was a \"5\". So, it is a \"4\" on balance!We arrived at 1030 and it took around 20 minutes to queue on arrival to get our wristbands and hire towels and a locker. By the time we had entered the park we couldn't find any sun loungers in the shade at any locations ( and ended up finding some near the Barracuda restaurants at the far end of the park which had a touch of shade under a palm tree (TIP arrive early to enter by opening time to secure a good spot and minimise queues). The park was well designed but would have benefited from more maps and signposting (as done well by the Disney and Sea World Parks in the USA) as it was very disorientating getting around. You could, on request, ask for a map at the shops but it was small and not really that helpful. The family really enjoyed the lazy river (despite my youngest son falling out of his tube on one of the conveyer belts and cutting his leg in two places - the staff beyond kindly got us out of the river and checked him over). We would have liked to have done more rides but there was no way of knowing which ones would be suitable for our children (perhaps the Park could consider providing a \"rating\" system with a brief description of each ride on their website). After some trial and error we discovered the Shark Attack ride which the kids loved and did 6 times over towards the end of the day. This park would also benefit from an independent \"Top Tips\" fact sheet to help guests get the most out of their day (although I guess that is partly what TripAdvisor does). Food was pricy but better quality than a typical US water park and much was freshly cooked to order. The taxi queue at the end of the day was lengthy, around 45 minutes waiting time, which was frustrating at the end of a very long and hot day. All in all a good day out and, with a few improvements in my view could be fantastic."

Our family had a rocky introduction after learning that a locker was 70 dirhams (\u00a314) and that towels were 30 dirhams each (\u00a36). Fortunately we had called ahead and brought our own towels. Once in, the rides were amazing! Long queues at times, but that's to be expected at a waterpark or any amusement park. We found plenty to keep 2 adults and a 6 and 9 year old entertained throughout the day. Lifeguards were stationed at frequent points for the lines as well as the beginning and end of each ride and along the lazy river. They were all friendly and very helpful. You cannot take in outside food and food in the park is very expensive which adds to the cost of your day.At various points on rides there is a photographer who gets a shot of you enjoying your day. You are given a wristband with a barcode which allows you to view the photos at the end of your day. We had some great shots, but the 100 dirham (\u00a320) charge seemed on the high side!Worth a visit and you will certainly have a great day, just be prepared to pay a premium for it! Not for those on a budget!"

This Water park was amazing, we went on a Friday which in Dubai is a public holiday and were told that it would be extremely busy and we would be waiting in line for 2 hours but it was actually the opposite, it was very quiet and we spent basically no time waiting in line apart from getting the tickets.The one downside that stopped this being an excellent review was that I had a dolphin encounter voucher that was valid for the week of my birthday and we got our tickets and went to the dolphin bay and found out that we had to make a booking and that I had only general admission not the dolphin encounter.Overall though it was an amazing time and I would definitely go there again."

Whilst we have experienced various waterparks together in the past, Singapore, Manila and others - Aquaventure tops it all! The variety of rides, the absolute seamlessness and smoothness of logistics, high quality of hygiene (water, changing rooms, overall cleanliness) and friendliness of the staff was out of this world. We have had a phenomenal time, spending >4 hours in the park and will certainly come back and most definitely recommend! Last but not least - great variety of attractions serving each age group, i.e. even for children below 120cm of height, so much to do and experience! Congratulations to the team at Atlantis and Aquaventure!"

            "review": "A fantastic day out! . My 5 year old daughter and I arrived at Aquaventure at around 9:45am, mid week. Even at this time, there were quite a few people here. I paid \u00a3130 ish for our entry, a small locker and 2 meal deals. The meal deals were printed on a ticket which we took along to the food hall for lunch. We started off straight away in the lazy river and used the river to find our way around most of the time, rather than walking. The rapids were lots of fun and the torrent section provided waves to add to the ride. The tubes are single or double and can include a child seat where the bottom is sealed to stop the little ones falling through. At the towel kiosks, you can pick up complimentary kids life jackets for use during the day. We took wet-shoes which we wore all day, eliminating the worry of extremely hot ground. The 'splashers' area was a huge hit with my little one; a big structure stood in shallow water with several different sized slides, water guns, tipping buckets and other such fun things. At lunch, we ordered a burger, hot dog and chips with drinks from our meal deals. The portions were a good size and really tasty. There are water fountains around the park near the restaurants and plenty of smaller stalls or kiosks for drinks and snacks. A huge souvenir cup cost 40dirhams and then 8d per refill after the first time, a regular soft drink is 15d. At the end of our day, we went to view the photos that had been taken by the photographers dotted around the different rides. These were priced at 100d per photo or 125 including a souvenir frame and the chance to email one copy of the purchased photo from a separate booth. The only thing I wish I'd done was bought a waterproof pouch and lanyard for my phone at 120d from all of the shops around the park so that I could have had more pictures from the day. Even though it was an expensive day out, we loved every minute and would definitely go again."

Although an expensive day out if you have a large family it is well worth getting there early to take full advantage of the cost. We went by car & were guided into a well organised clean car park where a shuttle bus took us straight to the main entrance of the Atlantis hotel, enabling us to walk through the shops etc before queuing to pay for access to the waterpark. there are many packages available so read carefully before you purchase. The best one was including the meal deal in the admission price, as the food in the 2 selected restaurants was really good and huge portions. Also pick up a waterproof phone cover in the shop before you enter so you can capture all the wet hilarious moments on camera ( we didn't so have none to share as had to lock up all our belongings in the locker beforehand)Now has access to a private beach which is identical to the one shared by hotel guests so you get to enjoy the use of sunbeds for free, view of the Burj al arab & can say you stayed on the Palm!"

We took a taxi, it cost us 70 aed from the Downtown area. Once inside the food and drink price are very high, like any theme park really. 12 aed for a bottle of water. ( you will need to bring a lot in the heat) be warned you cant bring any food or drinks in with you, they check your bags. Towels are not free, so bring your own. You can rent a locker, but as we found out once there you dont really need to, just leave your stuff on the sun beds , that are all over the place, everyone does it. Put your stuff in a small bag and hide under your towel ( use lockers for valuable though) be sure to bring flipflops or plastic jelly shoes, the ground is too hot to walk on barefoot. You can keep your shoes on for some rides, not all, you will leave them at the entrance or hold them during the ride. The beach is also free with the waterpark ticket. Found the place rather dirty overall,, and overpriced. Avoid going Friday and Saturdays, as these are the days off in Dubai."

Best day ever - have to visit if you enjoy water parks & like water rides etc.Only criticism would be that the floor gets wayyyy too hot so need some sprinkler's etc. so you can be cooled off.tips:1) book your tickets in advance, get them direct from the aquaventure website, this is the cheapest you will get.2) get your locker at the counter - small locker is 40AED & was enough for 2 bags & towels etc.3) bring your own towels4) bring water shoes - I read this on trip advisor & wish I listened to the reviewer!!!5) get money for food/refreshments etc. added to a wristband at the counter this saves you carrying any money inside the park. Any money leftover on your wristband is returned back to you at the end of the day. Food inside costs around 50AED per person. Bring your own water & stay hydrated.6) bring clothes to change into at the end of the day, they have shower facilities on site7) inside you only want your water, towel & flip flops - we left all 3 of these on sun loungers near the ride we went on & came back to collect when we wanted to move on. No one touches your stuff really so it's pretty safe, but we didn't carry into the park any valuables.8) getting to the aquaventure on the Metro or Tram is easy. We got there on the tram as the tram stop was right outside our hotel & we got off at Palm Dubai station & walked outside to get a taxi straight in. On the way back we got the mono-rail to the tram station."

This saved a good chunk but i then paid extra for Neptunes retreat which was fantastic for a water park. Private area with dedicated beds for you and towels and ice box with water and fresh fruit in the afternoon. Even had a button to press for our own Butler for food and drink and umbrella use.Water park is massive the lazy river takes at least 45 mins for one full cycle but you could stay on longer if you took a turn off on the side alleys which take you up a travellator on your ring to the 3rd floor of one of the towers.You can hire everything on site if you need it if not doing neptune. Such as towels and even go pros Food is good and reasonable priced. Far better quality than parks like Alton Towers etc in UK and better priced. You won't get a beer in the park which is a good thing and you cannot take food or drink in except a SEALED 1 litre bottle of water as there are strict bag checks on arrival.All of the rides easy to get as queues were non which i think we hit well. Got told to avoid time after RAMADAM as it gets mad.You can get to the beach also here. Top tip get to park as early as possible as ticket entrance is worst part long queues"

We went there, as a birthday gift to my son, who just turned 7, so he can have a very special day to remember, rather then the usual gifts. One of the best thing was that we managed to get a special day pass offer for residents, which made the whole experience less financially painful. After meeting the dolphins you have a Starbucks coffee to start your day with, and then a few hours later we ended up at a place called Barracudas.The staff was smiling and polite and you have an amazing variety of burgers ,pizzas, Asian food...you name it.They even have a home made ice cream!!!I bought a big and colorful Atlantis Cup, that you can re-fill anytime with your favorite soda for just 8 dhs. The prices were reasonable and the quality of the food was good.The Gift Shop and locker rooms are just around the corner, simplifying you life , if you forgot any essentials or want to keep your valuables safe.We ended up in Shark Bites, which is another great place to eat and great Meal-Deal offers.I highly recommend this place, as everyone was very professional and nice."

We choose midday as the sun isn't as harsh in Dubai until around 2 pm. The Lazy river is great and good to start out with as it breaks you in. Try both the rapids and Torrents and recommend you use one of the provided inflatables - we used a double. Then head off to the main tower called the Ziggurat where you can carry your inflatable up for a fairly adrenaline filled ride. You can meander back to the other rides as you are guided through. When this done, I'd recommend the Leap of faith - which is all of 3 seconds through the shark tanks. Make sure you cross your legs and arms and hold your nose. Make a valiant effort to open your eyes and you will see shadows of the Sharks as you go by. If you are still up more thrills, head over to the second tower where you share the slide in round rafts with around 5 others. There are handles to hold onto but not much else. There are 2 slides here which are both thrilling but there is also a verical drop down a chute called Posiedon's revenge. You stand in a see through pod which has a trap door and rhe pod is closed. Then the operator presses the button and the trap door drops. I stepped on but couldn't continue with this one (after spurring and convincing a stranger to try it!).You can head to the beach after for a dip in the sea or back to the lazy river. Would recommend purchasing a locker when you buy your ticket and removing your sunglasses but keep your flip flops. Also you can register for a free ticket for your birthday - you need to print the email out and take with you. Overall a fun day out but don't buy any of the snacks or drinks here as they are overpriced."

The waterpark wasnt overly crowded, and the queues for the rides took no longer than 5 minutes! It did get a little busier after the 2-3pm mark.. so the lines did get a little longer.We got there at about 10:15am and the place was just so alive! There are locker and towel hire available. The small lockers are able to fit a full average sized backpack. So there wasnt a need to spend the extra money on a larger locker.We spent just over 6 hours there - which is probably a lot more than some people would stay.. but we were able to go on every ride and the lazy pool was amazing! We ended up going back and just spending the last hour and a half there.There were rides for all ages. A section for the children and of course, the more thrilling rides. You could also pay an extra fee to do some of the other things provided such as swimming with the dolphins or taking the zip line from one ride to another.I've heard about people jumping queues there where the lifeguards just let them in, but had only experienced it once on one of the rides.We ate at the 'Shark Bite' restaurant and the food was okay. Food is quite expensive. We both got a small cheeseburger meal... and couldve really opted for a large meal and halved the burger!Remember to wear thongs/flip flops as the ground gets extremely hot.The ticket prices were quite expensive in my opinion, but we really made a day out of it and had so much fun! Hope this helps! Safe travels!"

To avoid this everyone is using flip flops all day and then having to carry them whilst on rides. Distinct lack of inflatables on the day we went. I thought the signage was poor also after the first section of the park and everyone seemed to be asking where to go for slides. Large sections of the connecting parts of the lazy river seemed to have no current whatsoever - I don't mind a bit of paddling but after the Rapids it was a bit ridiculous.Pro'sAwesome fun. The slides were very good and a great selection for all ages. The Rapids were good fun and connected nicely back with the lazy river (even if you did have to pull yourself along). Air Con food hall at the back of the park was nice to get away from the heat. Location - being on the Palm and next to the Atlantis is obviously a massive pull.Overall a good day out but I'd pick Wild Wadi if you go to just one of the Parks whilst in Dubai."

The best thing of the Aquaventure Waterpark is that at every corner you will find the helpful guards to extend help. you feel confident that you are at safe place and there is no room for any incident. Secondly, the water was so crystal clear that you can enjoy the water rides without any hygiene issue in your mind. So for me the safety and hygiene at the waterpark is always very important which is very well taken care by the management of Aquaventure.

We pre-booked our tickets to aquaventure which saved a bit off the entry price as we weren't staying at the Atlantis hotel.When we arrived at the ticket office area we were surprised to see the queue was bigger for pre-booked tickets compared to people paying on the day. We probably queued for about 30 mins which was a bit annoying, There is very little effort made to educate you on all the various options around buying lockers, towels, prepaid wristbands which would help reduce queue time and at least offer some form of entertainment. Once we were through the pain of the queue we dropped our things in a locker, unfortunately the first locker we'd been allocated was broken which wasted about 10 mins of our time. After this things got a lot better. The water park itself is great for adults and kids, my only other recommendation to the management would be to put up more maps to help find your way around the water park better.We visited on a Sunday to void the weekend crowds."

This is our third visit to Aquaventure and I feel that the overall cleanliness has slipped. Also, there were many areas closed off during week days like the river entrances at the top and even the pools. Having stayed here for two weeks and entering the waterpark on most days, this is a regular occurrence. This is quite frankly ridiculous considering the amount of money you spend to visit. There were no lifeguards at the two highest sections of the waterpark so the children weren't allowed to even paddle and yes I realise safety first but when you see the gentlemen with blue tops and clipboards (team leaders as they are known and too important to even smile or greet you) sitting down in the shade having a joke and laugh instead of sorting out the situation, it can really rile you!!!!! Maybe they could step in?! I do feel for the lifeguards that have to tell you it's closed, it must really get them down!!!! Here's an idea - sort out the schedule before hand! Employ more people. Team leaders step in when there is a shortage? If it is a money saving ploy then shame on Atlantis!"

In particular, I would like to thank Deepak and his team. Furthemore, I must mention the excellent care and professionalism shown by William our personal concierge. We booked a Combo ticket which allowed us all day access to the main water park, as well as entrance to The Lost Chambers. We also booked a Family cabana which was lovely. Plenty of room, with 4 lovely sun loungers, dining table and 4 chairs, under the cabana. Furthermore, 2 large lazy boys and a good sized hammock. 12 bottles of water in a large cooling box with fruit was provided. A large wardrobe space with safety deposit unit is also provided with the cabanas. Towles are provided. We were glad to have taken the cabana as the park got extremely busy with little umbrellas and deck chairs available. The cabana area is large and marked out. Staff are attentive at not allowing others into your cabana area. During the day, we did not get the chance to try all the rides as the park caters more for teens and adults, rather than young kids. As we had our 2 year old daughter, we enjoyed the lazy river and kids water section which was huge and great fun. I got the chance, when my wife and daughgter were sleeping, to try the Leap of Faith ride within The Tower Of Neptune. Outstanding. Overall, a very good day out. We then finished our day around 4pm by a lovely and refreshingly cool experience at The Lost Chambers."

There are many daring rides include the Leap of Faith, the Challenger Slides and the Serpent slide. For younger children there is Splasher's Kids Pool and several other kid's pools. Their slides which are second to none along with the marine life that's integrated into some of the rides \u2013This place offers great time. Atlantis is a Paradise, which offers amenities for all ages!"

The quickest way to get entry is to take one of the beach golf carts from one of the stops near the pools. The cart then stops at a kiosk for you to get your entry bands for the day. The floor gets very hot in Aquaventure so be sure to take some footwear you could take with you on a ride. We always try and get sun beds near the beach. There's a grass bank, under the trees which is a popular location to have as a base."

It was alot of time waste as we went to the park quite late in the evening. Pictures were very expensive to buy. Didnt know that you need to tell the camera guys to take your family picture. You dont get nice pictures done if you dont grab a camera man who will be everywhere in the parks. Dont forget to buy your waterproof phone cover (worth the money, you can buy from park shops or cheaper to buy from your own countries)"

You only feel scared for the first two times...the third time onwards, you feel like going again and again...trust me, you have to go on it twice atleast!...the first time will be a shock as you wouldnt be expecting it. There are two lockers...one next to barracudas, the other one next to the entrance. Leave EVERYTHING in the lockers except water bottles, slippers, which are required as the floor gets very hot, spectacles (if you own a pair) and a towel...If you like to keep your eyes open, do bring swimming goggles.I brought along two bags a big one and a small sling one...no one touches your bag or things...i was away from my belongings for 2 hours and nothing happened.

Would advise to accompagny small kids, as some parts are bit more challenging. Also plenty of spots for getting some drinks and food. If you're willing to spend the money, swimming with the dolphins is a really great of course. As the 'shuttle' service is constantly on its way, it's easy to use it as hop on/hop off service. Bottom line, great place to visit for at least a day, whether or not your a guest of the Atlantis The Palm hotel."

We were in a group of 10 and each one of us got the chance to dance hug and kiss with our lovely dolphin. The package gave us access to all the rides of the waterpark and we tried a few which was great fun. Lunch at the park was really good with a lot of things to chooce from. The place IS CROWDED which is expected but if you go earlier in the day things seem a lot better !! I am an animal lover so i dont regret i did this and i will always treasure the memory !!"

We went on a Monday so the waterpark wasn't too busy and there were hardly any queues which was great. The most we waited for any ride was about 10 minutes and that was only for the large water raft rides.The waterpark is really clean and very well presented.They have a great selection of water rides for ages. I particularly loved the 'water coasters', the rapids and the large water raft rides.This is one of the best waterparks I have been too and is definitely up there in comparison to the Disney waterparks in Florida.Entry isn't cheap however it is well worth the money if you spend the day on site. If it is your birthday (or the week after), make sure you sign up on-line for free entry for your birthday week. A great promotion that they run!When arriving on site you get the option to 'charge' your wristband (entry pass) with money in order to purchase food/drinks etc. on site. This is a great idea as it means you don't need to carry cash/cards etc. with you for purchases and saves you having to return to your locker. Any money you don't spend is refunded when you leave.On the note of lockers, these are really big and one locker will easily have enough space for two adults.An excellent park which we look forward to visiting again soon."

For a city that does everything in extremes, this water park is far too small, far too overpriced and very very busy.Queuing takes about 15-20mins per ride and the majority of them are pretty average. For a little adventure in the South of France, this is acceptable. But for a \u00a370 day out in Dubai? Not good enough. Everything costs money. You want a towel? Money. A locker? Money. I really sing understand why it's so busy. Or why this does so well on TripAdvisor.The aquarium next door is similarly disappointing. There's nothing really 'wrong' with it, but for such a high profile resort in Dubai it's a let down.We didn't stay at the hotel that accompanies this resort, but would be wary to. I can't comment on the accommodation but it is quite some distance from the city and transport isn't particularly reliable.Avoid."

Food was good, ice cream was good, staff were good, rides and slides were good, aquarium is good, queues were good (esp before lunch), cleanliness good, safety good. Lots of things were good...And there were no big negatives either - but lots of small ones... - remote parking with shuttle bus; - bus drop off point not really convenient for entry; - slow ticket desk queue as only 4/12 counters open...- no map provided at check in - though they found one when I asked- an initial error in the price charged (quickly resolved when challenged); - a kids pool area that is brilliant for 5 year olds but has little to offer 2 year olds; - and way too small for core customer numbers (parents with little kids)which means too many people (and sunbeds) crammed in; - general signage is good but signage to each ride/at ride entry points is poor; - there's an illogical ziggurat ride system that forces everyone to fetch inflatable rings from a pool 100m away (why don't they have rings stocked at the ziggurat?); - one ride closed for maintenance (advised by a very small sign at the ticket desk);- one ride where you have to be 45kg to go on - which would have been ok except my sub 45kg 8&5 yr olds had already been charged full fare based on their height- you can pay for food using a wristband but the cash desk staff have no way of telling you how much stored value remains; - all in a huge site which seemed generally quite quiet and spacious except around the overcrowded kids pool.I'm not saying it's a bad place, but there is certainly room for improvement and, tbh, the wow factor just wasn't there. In my view, for families with kids (mine are 8, 5 and 2) it's not as good as Yas Waterworld or Wild Wadi (at similar prices), and even 'old skool' Dreamland offers more for a lot less."

High light was shark attack where the last bit of the ride on the tube is through a tunnel in the shark and predators tank so it's like you are in the aquarium under water. My 7 year old loved it. She just made the height restriction (phew !)Some of the rides are actually pretty hair raising so do be careful with younger kids. The rotary tube ride around the park is pretty nice but we managed to get quite disorientated and didn't know where to get off. Couple bare feet on boiling hot walkways it made our getting back to the rest of our party interesting but we managed to hitch a ride on the complimentary carts so alls well.Kiddies pool was nice but very overcrowded so i cant imagine what it must be like in peak holiday season. The prices are criminal though. Lunch for 2 cost over USD80. A large coke is USD 6-9. A potato chip stick thingy is USD 10. Although locals get a half off price, I struggle struggle with the prices and doubt we would go back. The whole of Dubai is overpriced but this makes Disneyland look modest by comparison.

Also at this time we noticed you could pre-book sunbeds at Neptune's retreat for \u00a360 per couple this got you 2 beds , 4 towels and 6 bottles of water and was located in a fenced off area within the park. On arrival we were shown the red carpet treatment due to reserving beds everyone was very nice and helpful. At the retreat there is also a kind of consierge service where they will go and get your order for food and drink allowing you to enjoy other benefits of the park. The park itself has everything you could want except I think there could possibly be more individual flume rides. Overall we had a great day and I would highly recommend you reserving sunbeds at the additional cost."

            "review": "What the website doesn't tell you...... So just been to Atlantis waterpark and had a cracking day, so much we got back to hotel and just zonked out. But there were issues which we didn't expect hence the review.....1) it seems to be the only place left back in the 20th century with regards to bookings In sense that you have to actually print the voucher and cannot show them on your mobile device, which is silly in this day and age so print the voucher if you have booked through viator or such. If you don't, you can go to the hotel business centre which is a good 10 walk through to the other side and pay to have it printed.2) hidden costs..... Atlantis do look after their own guests (which is fair enough). If you are visiting for a day trip, expect to pay 50AED (\u00a310ish) for a towel and locker set (non refundable). They do search your bags on entry and you are allowed to take up to 1Litre of water per person so do it as they do charge Disney type prices for refreshments and such when in there.3) flip flops, take them!! The floor is hot hot hot so what you can do is wear waterproof flippys around the park and up to the slides, we found the lifeguards just threw them down the slide to the bottom to be there when you did, or you can leave them at the bottom as all slides were in same facinity.We had a great day and it was brilliant, but felt these points did need to be raised so not unexpected. Top tip, get there for half 9ish when hotel guests going into breakfast, found walked onto all rides until about 11ish"

We got free entry to the waterpark included as we stayed at the Atlantis, the water park is a good size and there are plenty of rides to suit all ages, my 7 year old son loved the faster rider and the one off the top of the tower through the shark tank, my youngest who is 4 loved the kids area and spent most of the day there. The park is secure and had no fear of leaving our bags on loungers whilst we where on the rides and slides. Food in the park is expensive especially the drinks, luckily for us as we where staying at the Atlantis we would chill bottles of water in the room and then take these with us in a cooler bag also chilled bottled drinks are available in the monorail station for 3 to 4 dirhams. This is located just outside the entrance.Overall a great experience and would visit again, although the wild wadi is pretty much the same and more hotels allow free access to it."

We also got the meal deal for 40 AED each which includes a meal and a drink at one of the fast food counters in the park. Plenty of beds and stalls to get refreshments. There is a handy golf caddy that takes you from one end of the park to the other which helps a lot as the floor is so hot we both burnt our feet as you can't wear flip flops etc on the slides so could do with fountains wetting the ground like the water parks in Orlando have which I found really useful! Apart from that we had a really good day and the staff operating the slides and Rapids etc were all friendly. Would definitely go again but maybe wear some wet shoes!"

The park itself is not that big and it's very crowded. We spent lots of times waiting on the queues for attractions that only last a couple of minutes. Also, the park opens at 10am and closes at 17.30, though at 16.30 they started closing some of the attractions. For the price of the ticket (around 75 euros), they could at least close at 19.00 like other bigger waterparks in Mexico, Spain and Portugal. Also, the general admission doesn't include anything else than the entrance... You'll need to rent a locker for 10 euros to leave your belongings (you can't carry your things with you and get on the water attractions with them). If you want pictures or food you'll need to pay 10 euros or more as well. Food is not allowed into the park and your bag will be checked before you're let in, they'll check it after you've paid for your ticket. They'll give you the choice to eat your food or dispose of it before going in. This does not appear on their website either.I recommend you go with a towel as otherwise you'll need to rent one as well, which you'll need to return anyway.Also, the only way to reach the park as a tourist is via the monorrail, which costs around 7 euros for the return ticket. We were shocked to know that we couldn't even keep the ticket for this tram. They won't let you outside the monorrail unless you return your ticket upon your arrival to the station.Though the waterpark and views to the Atlantis hotel are amazing, their greediness have made this park into a place I don't really recommend unless you have plenty of time in Dubai and don't mind spending lots of money for a couple of hours of fun and lots of time waiting in queues."

I couldn't do any of the rides due to a bad back but my family only managed 4 (yes only 4!) rides in all the time we were there. What a flippin waste of money! Our ticket also included a trip to the Aquarium - husband really enjoyed this bit and it was air conditioned and not too busy. But the worst bit was still to come...we weren't staying at the Atlantis Hotel so had to join the queue for a taxi...it was daylight when we joined the queue and dark by the time we got one. 75minutes yes, 75minutes.

What an adventure!!!The park opens at 10:00 AM, so if you arrive around that time you avoid any lines at all and can ride all the scary rides that last 6 seconds several times in a row without waiting. If you are not residing at the Atlantis resort, getting to the waterpark from the Dubai downtown area will cost you, about, 90 AED one way ($24.50 USD) But, to save money, you can take the metro all the way to the park for about 42 AED ($11.00 USD), one-way. I preferred the Big Bus because at 285 AED you get to see the whole of Dubai in 48hrs, and it was a great way to see the city. The lazy river had a wave pool connected to it and fun rapids to ride down over and over again if you were not into water slides. The waterslides ranged from mild to extremely wild! They have waterslides that are completely blacked out and ones that push you up like an actual roller coaster. Avoid eating the food from the kiosks stationed around the park. It is a waste of money and gross. It is best to eat at one of the restaurants located in the hotel. I spent about 6 hours at the park and felt I got my money's worth. This is, by far, probably one of the best waterparks that I have been to the $71 admission fee, is absolutely worth it. Highly recommend!!!"

Very well managed and staff very well trained.We arrived early in the morning, so there were no lines to all of the rides. Been on all the rides within an hour or so. 'Leap of Faith' was my personal favourite. By the time we left around midday, the park was extremely busy.Hotel guests from Atlantis have unlimited free entry to the park and free shuttle buses between the beach area of the park and the hotel, if you don't want to walk that little distance. However, when you see the views from the beach area or the top of some of the rides, you will be tempted to walk anyway to be able to enjoy the magnificent views. Hotel guests also enjoy unlimited free towels (30 AED for visitors), which you can pick up anywhere within the park and when done, just drop off into the used towels bins, so you don't have to carry it around.You do have to carry the tubes around if you want to use majority of the rides though, as they are not provided at the top. Only 2 rides use their own large tubes, which you just jump into.They also have GoPro hire at the front of the park to let you capture all the fun if you want to relive it after you leave.The only criticism (and the only reason why this isn't 5 stars) was how hot the ground got towards midday. It was so hot you could hardly walk on it without burning your feet. Considering it's a waterpark, most people would be walking bare feet, so that's probably the only area they need to improve/find a solution for, in an otherwise very well run waterpark.Highly recommended, especially for Atlantis hotel guests."

Nonetheless, the rides are a must -the best has to be the leap of faith. Be sure to enjoy some beach time as well. The staff are very friendly too. The restaurant, shark bites, is overpriced but it's what you would expect at a theme park.Tip for Shark Bites: No need to book 2 meals, one portion of fries is more than enough including on drink for free refills. Do not get sucked into the promotions. Tip for Aquaventure: Go early and avoid the weekends (Fri & Sat) for maximum enjoyment. The park, without rush hour, only takes 4-5 hours to enjoy."

Not to mention, if you visit the park on your birthday, your admission is FREE! And that's what I exactly did. But, had I paid the $71 admission fee, it would have been worth it. The lazy river had a wave pool connected to it and fun rapids to ride down over and over again if you were not into water slides. The waterslides ranger from mild to extremely wild! They have waterslides that are completely blacked out and ones that push you up like an actual roller coaster. If you are not staying at the Atlantis resort, getting to the waterpark from the Dubai airport area will cost you, roughly, 90 AED one way ($24.50 USD) But, to save money, you can take the metro all the way to the park for about 42 AED ($11.00 USD), one-way. I preferred the metro because it was 90% above ground, and it was a great way to see the city. The park opens at 10:00 AM, so if you arrive around that time you avoid any lines at all and can ride all the scary rides that last 6 seconds several times in a row without waiting. DO NOT eat the food from the kiosks stationed around the park. It is a waste of money and gross. It is best to eat at one of the restaurants located in the hotel. We spent about 4 hours at the park and felt we got our money's worth. I would go back for sure!!!"

But once inside the rides are fantastic!! we went on all the ones in the temple are and were a little dissapointed with the park as we hadn't realised there are a lot more rides in the furthest corner of the park and they are FANTASTIC!! Really enjoyed it. The beach wasn't worth bothering with as the sand is so sharp, it's painful to walk on, and the sea is covered in a layer of scum as it doesn't appear to move (on the inner branch of the palm island). We went on Sunday so the ques were not too bad and left at around 4 utterly exhausted and happy. It's only downfall is the cost, which is (like everything in Dubai) totally over the top! take a pair of cheap flipflops you don't mind loosing as the floor gets very hot!!"

This wasn't great because I've done a waterslide just because I wanted a picture, and at the end I had nothing!Otherweise the parc is safe, clear, amazing, funny and the entry price is OK for the given service (Naturally there are a lot of exstentions for giving out more money :-)It's a great parc, I really recommend it!"

Its well worth purchasing a cabana , its a closed off area where you get your own sunbeds along with an icebox full of bottles of water. There are hosts wandering around and it is safe to leave your belongings if you want to go to the rides. Alternatively there are lockers which are dirt cheap.

Only sticky point was when we were trying to get in - the car park is not clearly marked and complicated by the fact that you have to park in the first car park you come across and then get into a shuttle bus (also not clearly marked!). However, everyone we stopped and asked pointed us along the right way. Lockers - we managed to cram clothes for me and the two boys into one small locker, but it was close! The digital scanner/wristband system works great. We also put money on the wristband and used this for drinks etc through the day. the money we didn't use was refunded easily at the end.We went during the week and I think that made all the difference as we didn't really have to queue for any of the rides - or if there was a queue we just popped across to the empty queue for a similar ride. We all had flip-flops/crocs as the ground did get quite hot - we also had sunglasses and I had a cap too. You can either leave these at the bottom of the stairs to the rides (there are plenty of lifeguards there) or hold them on with you. We also left a bag and towels on one of the beach loungers - nothing went missing, even though we only came back to it twice during the whole day. If you don't want to take your camera/phone in with you, you can hire GoPro cameras at the entrance or there are photographers at all the key points to take pictures and give you a wristband so you can view and buy your pictures at the end of the day (they are good).All the staff here are fantastic - without exception. Lifeguards are VERY patient if there are queue-jumpers and very helpful about making sure everything is secure/safe before you set off on the rides. Our boys went off down the river as soon as we got in and it took us a while to get a double ring to follow them - so we couldn't find them for the first 30-40mins - if this happens (we asked one of the lifeguards), you can tell one of them and they will put out a general alert so that if anyone sees your kids, they will bring them out and get them to come to a pre-arranged place.We had a fantastic day - fully on the go from when we arrived (around 11) to when it closed. There was a bit of a queue for showers at the end of the day, but it soon cleared and there is no rush to leave.Fantastic day and we would definitely go back again! Well worth the money!"

Just follow the safety instructions and watch some youtube videos and you are just safe. Lifeguards all over with good attention. Your heart will stop at some point but will be back in soon. Not recommended for people not taller than 1.2m and pregnant ladies. Wear proper swimming attire - they will not allow clothes in cotton or any such materials. Even though you have paid for the ticket no chance of doing activities (still you can be on the pool). Minimum price to buy a men's short is 118 AED. So be with your proper swimming attire. There are additional activities you can pay separately and attend. Check on the fly while you do the activities in park. There are few hell of a kind activities just do them - will be excellent memories, recommended to use go pro to capture your memories. Don't forget to pay a visit to beach after your action filled day in water park which is maintained by Atlantis hotel. You can have a sea bath. Beach is not the best one but still in range. You need a full day of your schedule for Aquaventure Waterpark. Use cabs to reach as Metro/Tram will cost you same amount of money if you travel as group. Couple metro will be cheap."

I (gramps) had the good luck to be dragged around the water \"canals\" from slide to slide by the teenagers while I relaxed in a large tube.Most slides had reasonably short waits, especially Poseidon's revenge where the few people who had the courage to tackle it tended to dither about gathering their courage to go. It's terrific especially when the trap door beneath with your feet suddenly opens and you plunge down from a great height. Worth the money for this slide alone.Get there early to make sure you have a choice of sunbed to choose from particularly if you are with family.We found best eating places were towards Poseidon Tower.To relax towards the end of a busy day it's well worth going to the beach area. Indeed a family looking for a quiet time can go to the beach while more adventurous members can go to Poseidon Tower nearby for more exciting fun."

            "review": "Top tips for Atlantis Aquaventure waterpark. A fantastic day out with kids which can be quite expensive. Here's how to get the most out of it without breaking the bank. Dubai residents get a discounted rate. Buy tickets on the door with a drivers licence for residents to get these tickets. Book your tickets online 24 hours before you go to get discounted rates. Different browsers and peripherals throw up different results. Easiest was using Safari on an iPad. Take your own towels. Ticket price does not include a towel which works out to AED30 a towel. One towel is good for an adult and small child cos they're huge. Showers have soap and shampoo so leave yours at home. Girls' showers have hairdryers too. Wear slippers with straps so you don't lose them on rides. From 10am to 3pm the stone floors are super hot and a little rough so can become very uncomfortable if you go around barefoot like most people do. Try and get hats or baseball caps you can attach to kids' heads. The sun and glare is strong. Take your own water. Small bottles of water can cost about USD4 and ice cream ranges from USD4-10. Get a waterproof case for your smartphone to get those holiday snaps in the park. Photos from the good people at The Atlantis cost USD33 per snap. Eat before you go. We went after lunch for 230pm when it wasn't blisteringly hot and had a great time till 6pm when it hit rush hour traffic times. It makes sense to go with kids who are over 1 metre 20 centimeters so they can enjoy all the rides. Study the waterpark map before going in. Some rides seem to have more than one name so hunting them down in the park can be confusing. Eg the ziggurat rides are also called the boomerango/poseidon's revenge and the rapids was also part of the lazy river. Some rides require that you grab a float ring for yourself or kids before getting on. Also some double floats have a child seat with a plastic bottom in them and others don't. Depending on your kids' ages grab the right one. There are separate cabanas overlooking swimming pools that can be booked out for larger groups. Have a good one."

The Leap of Faith was skipped this year and both experienced this last time and neither were keen for another go! Poseidon's pyramid rides were new to us and I have to admit I found them too much! The boys enjoyed them far more! We found that the costs for the day were high 400 dirhams (\u00a380) but it was a full day.

My 6 year old son loves the shark attack (where you ride through a tunnel surrounded by sharks, rays etc).

The park is well laid out, very well maintained and has a vast amount of extremely friendly staff. My 4 year old daughter loves the children's area and spends hours on the smaller slides within this area. It may seem expensive but it's a great day out!

Best being in the water on the huge rubber ring and just go with the flow drifting with water current. When we eventually got a seat, it was great and we were able to relax and enjoy the ambiance. On that day only three toilets were available for the women and it did cause a fair amount of delay for all the people in the park using the changing room. Minor issues, otherwise great fun."

We went on pretty much all the rides and we had fun on each one. We ended up going on three times on one particular ride due to the fun we had. I recommend you go as close to the opening time as possible to beat the heavy queues which develop by lunch time. We went as soon as it opened at 10am and we managed to make a full day of it. There is also a beach which is nice to wind down later on in the day. However, be warned that the water has some sharp shells on the sandbed which can make it a bit painful if you are not careful.The waterpark itself is very clean and most of the staff are helpful (we did come across some grumpy staff members when asking for help, but this may be due to the weather as it was extremely hot). Overall worth a visit, albeit slightly pricey if you have kids to pay for too."

This was my first trip to a 'good' water park and couldn't have been better. There is a child's play area, lazy river, rapids, couple of towers where each has a few rides. I was a little freaked out with Poseidon's revenge and did everything else. The sight of people falling down in transparent tubes, almost vertically, from a floor below is a little scary. Leap of faith is very good. For a moment, you feel you have lost contact with the slide. Tips:1. People wrote food isn't allowed. Dietary and kid food is allowed. Checking isn't as intense you can slip in energy bars - we didn't carry any reading all other reviews. 2. Food is very expensive even by a very good hotel/ restaurants standards. Buy meal coupons for each one prior. 3. Some people advised to carry chutes. We did initially. And there are too many of them. So, please don't be stuck up. 4. You do need to carry your chutes to the Leap of faith tower rides. There are plenty in the lazy river. 5. Start from the last tower (Poseidon) and reach early 9 30 AM. 6. Strictly beach wear - Strictly! Be prepared to spend AED 300-400 otherwise. 7. Boom before and online. 8. Try and close early by 5 pm so you avoid the rush for the cab. You'll be yearning to leave anyway by then.9. It's hot so sunscreens are must, hats are optional. 10. Men, carry a swimming vest - copious amounts of sunscreens won't help. 11. Go on weekdays. ... Have fun!!"

Plenty of positives and the only main negative was that children have to be 1.2M to ride 90% of the rides here as opposed to 1.1M at Wild Wadi. Lazy river however was great for families and we watched the dolphins and sea lions as spectators and this was fun too. We would return to the park and hopefully the kids will be 1.2M in height where the kids can ride all the attractions and not just the lazy river and kids water park. Staff are curtious and the park is clean and safe. Nice water park to visit if you have chance."

Both my husband and I had a great time at Aquaventure Waterpark & would highly recommend it for anyone visiting Dubai.We got there for 10am when doors opened, which was a good idea as after lunch time and early afternoon the lines started to get very busy. We collected our tickets nice & quickly with minimal wait time.Booked ticked online (I believe if you do this 24hr in advance there is some sort of discount offered?) You have to pay extra for towel & locker hire, and you can also rent a go pro.I did not purchase any food or drink so cannot comment on how good or bad that was.The lazy rapids were good fun and there was plenty of double tubes available.A lot of the waterslides are also tandem which is good if you are a bit on the scared side like myself!Majority of the rides that I went on did have some sort of element of darkness to them, but coming from someone who hates the dark & closed in slides, they were not very bad and I ended up laughing and screaming on all of them.The ground does get very hot so bring a pair of thongs (flip flops), we took ours off and left them near the rides we were going on and they were always there when we got back.One thing to note if you are travelling with children there is a height restriction of 1.2m on a lot of rides so be aware of this before purchasing tickets.Highly recommended while in Dubai - have fun while staying cool in the hot weather!!"

We have been to all the Orlando water parks and I would say Aquaventure beats them hands down because of the lack of queues. Although the park was busy the longest time we had to wait was for Leap of Faith (the big one!) and that was around 20 minutes. All the other rides were around 5 minutes or less. Disney needs to take lessons on queuing from this park! Good fun days although I wouldn't go if I was just laying on a bed - they're not that comfy! TIP If you are going with children most of the rides are 1.2 meters minimum height although if you have little ones the children's play area is amazing."

We bought tickets in the airport and we were told our 4-year old boy could do almost every attraction if he could swim (he can). When we arrived at the slides, he could not go in because he was to small. We understand this safety procedure but then the price should be half for kids as they only have the kidspark. As a parent you then also pay a lot because you can not and be with your kid in the park and on the slides. Better idea would be to have 2 kind of tickets. One for the kidspark and rapid rivers and one that includes everything. Entrance is very bad organized as even with our pre-bought tickets we had to wait for 1 hour to get in and to receive our bracelet-tickets that then did not work, another 20 min waiting before to have my belongings in the locker and at the restaurant or every time you order something with a bracelet that is not working. Lockers are to pay and you only have them in the beginning of the park which is bad organized as you can not take your personal belongings in the water attractions, they should be next to very toilet or something like that. BUT a special thank to the staff, these peolpe are amazing, they did everything to help, watch the kids coming out of the slides and the manager gave our son a free ride on the slopes as he saw that we were all very dissappointed about him not being able to go in the aquarium-slide. The staff is amazingly friendly and caring about 'safety-first' which is very important here, so thumbs up for the working people on the field."

The beach is also not that impressive. If you do decide to give it a visit my tips would be buy your tickets online in advance as that queue is shorter; Take the tram/metro and the monorail instead of queuing for a taxi - the monorail is 25AED per person for a return (15AED one way); A small locker is big enough for a standard size rucksack; and get the meal deal if you want to eat there.

The park was great for a day out - we arrived early (around 9.30am) which was a good time to arrive - very little queues and they let you in to get changed before 10am, but arriving earlier means you get selection of beds which were full by around lunchtime completely! There was a good selection of rides and a fun 'lazy river' with rapids and torrent as part of it! Best ride is shark attack where you finish in the aquarium, but a lot of the rides aren't too scary! We loved our day here - only downside was trying to get a taxi afterwards and traffic off the Palm!"

There are not many rides and due to which each rides becomes so crowded that you don't feel like going. The only ride i liked is leap of faith and the rest were just ok. You would get better rides here in Water Kingdom and surely much better at Aqua Imagine.It is marketed like there is nothing like it, a place in Atlantis palm that's it. Being at a costly place does not makes it exciting. Further the facilities are not good enough to accommodate big crowd. Not at all recommended"

The changing rooms were clean but lockers are 40D each and small and as there are only separate changing rooms if you are travelling as a family the logistics are complicated if you don't want to pay for more than 1 locker.

Here are some highlights;- Higher entry prices as compared to other water theme parks in Europe / World - Busy rides and not so clean waters- Filthy changing rooms - Expensive lockers hire- You can't bring in any food or drinks from outside- Overpriced and poor quality food - No concept of single riders, long queues on major rides- 2+ hours of wait in the taxi queue on the way back OR pay for a premium taxi [aka bribe] and bypass the queueWe visited with a young family in March, our day was first spoilt by the rude security guards from the point we entered the park. Their treatment was insulting and condescending towards all guests as I observed.We were forced to discard the soya milk and special food for my son who allergic to dairy, nuts and eggs despite showing the hospital letter which most airlines, hotels, parks and restaurants have accepted and given us an exemption. The very rude security guard made it clear either throw the food or no entry !Since returning I've written a complaint 3 days ago, however no response as of yet.Additionally when we exited the park, around ~6pm the queue for the taxi was miles long and there were no taxis available. My wife and young child were not comfortable standing in the queue for 2 hours waiting for a taxi after a horrible day so we had no choice but to pay for a premium taxi [basically a bribed system where a private hire will whisk you off the queue]. They charged 200 dirham where the usual taxi will charge 25 Dirham."

The crazy river is the best I've ever experienced and there were no major queues for the slides. Major downside which spoiled the start of our Aquapark day was the faulty lockers. From other reviews I see there is a common problem which management at Atlantis need to resolve. Waited for 40 mins to get a faulty locker to be re-opened. Rude staff at the locker/towel counter. Very poor customer service. I get the fact technical problems happen from time to time but it all comes down to how the staff and management handle the situation. Unfortunately, Atlantis is not quite there yet on their customer service!!That said, when we eventually got our day started, the park proved to be good fun,slides for all ages and levels of courage!Tip, if you get a locker, please test it first before putting anything inside. Make sure it locks and re-opens on first attempt. Otherwise you are in for a long and very frustrating wait. Management, take note and get it sorted!!!!"

Didn't have time to venture all the rides as they are only open from 10am till 5:30pm. So it's best to start your day early there as soon as they open up. It is best that you book online first for the entry tickets. Also, book a locker that will be very helpful too."

This time we thought we would not book as weather had been a bit unpredictable . We checked the price the day before we went online and when we arrived at atlantis the price was so much more. It worked out about \u00a360 more on the gate for 3 people. We booked a combo ticket that was also for the aquariums. If you need a locker this is another \u00a38 or 40 aeds on top for a small. if your child us over 1.2 metres then you have to pay an adult price and they do check. Once inside it's great clean and we'll maintained. You have the lazy river and the shark drop ride which you have to find and take a ring with you on most rides along with a couple that you go on a big ring that takes about 7. But be prepared to quew even on less busy days. If you get there early go for the most popular rides then as not such big lines. There are lots of areas with sunbeds but be sure to leave your towels on them and not just leave shoes or a bag under as people will just put their towels on them and disregard your stuff. There are many places serving food and has different choices at each place so look around. You can get burger meals chicken pizza sandwiches ect. For an adult meal combo it's around 65 aed \u00a312 I had a chicken club sandwich with fries and a drink. My daughter had a kids meal chicken nuggets fries and a milk for 39 aed about \u00a38 I think I also got a fruit salad at 14 aed for small. Food and snacks are quite pricey ice lollies are around \u00a35 each. We brought a refillable cup for \u00a38 including the first drink then it was just under \u00a32 each time you had it refilled. They take you pictures all the time so you end up with arm full of bands each time they take one. The only thing I would say is the signs for the rides and the directions could be better as you do tend to get lost or confused with them. If you want a taxi back to your hotel then expect a long wait of over an hour or more if you leave as the park closes or even after an hour after. We went to the aquarium after thinking that the line would be gone but we still had to wait for over an hour. The monorail from atlantis to the tram is 15 aed each one way which isn't a lot but when you consider a taxi is about a third of this total. Then once you get off the monorail you have to get a tram then the metro depending where your hotel is it does work out expensive. Also you get approached by private taxi drivers whilst waiting in line but they inflate the cost of the taxi by about 5 times the cost. Or my advice would be book a taxi in advance as you can get some taxis that only get booked by a call. All in all its a good family fun day out but costly. But it's a definite must do when in dubai . Oh the floor gets hot when walking to rides so take flipflops with you on the rides."

I thought we lost everything, incl. my wallet, iphone, cloth, etc. After searching everywhere we found the stuff on the floor in the locker area. According to the park staff, I didn't lock the locker properly. Apparently, their normal procedure is to automatically allocate such a locker to somebody else regardless if it is full. I was unlucky that this somebody else just threw my stuff out and put their stuff in my locker without any staff warning. Their manager admitted that this happens quite often, but only blamed myself in what has happened without even saying 'sorry' as if it is a normal situation. The process definitely doesn't work and their manager is not professional enough to treat this issue properly, I could even use a word 'rude' when he talked to us."

Spent the day shooting down huge slides with my 15 year old daughter; sometimes in a hoop, sometimes in a big paddling pool type arrangement and other times by the seat of my red swimming trunks. It was brilliant. We did all the slides. Some were gentle, smiley time, others proper white knuckle jobs e.g. standing straight in a capsule until the floor is removed from where you stand leaving gravity to do its best in a vertical drop ...fantastic! There is a whole day and more of action packed activity. Or you can as my wife did and sun yourself by the pool all day. Food was not cheap but I decided it was good value, one chicken breast sandwich could have fed two adults, the burger was good meat and fries were plentiful. I couldn't give it all 5 stars partly because it is so busy but you would expect that when there is so much fun to be had. The key problem we had was after leaving the park roadworks jammed the roads in and out, there was not a cab to be had, it took an age to get away. We were unlucky. If this happens to you, hop on the mono rail back to the mainland and get a cab from there (as I learned the next day). It really is a fantastic adventure park for kids, teenagers and adults that have not quite grown up yet."

And better to stay at hotel so You avoid the painful taxi line as mentioned by a lot of people.We got there at 10, opening. There was a long line even for those who bought ahead and saved some money. We did the large locker which worked out for valuables and put money on the wristband (hold on to your receipt in a special spot, guy gave us a hard time at end).We found some chairs near the kid zone play area and parked our towels and a non valuable bag. If you don't care about the kid zone, find a nice place on the other side. Not as crazy busy and better sun access. Then we were off to the rides. All the rides were hard to know where they were at, how scary it was, do you need an inner tube. So you just watch where people are going and look at the safety sign or weight or other signals. Also the queues aren't very organized. Especially the shark attack ride where it empties into an aquarium. Cool but I would suggest to do first thing in the morning or last. It was an hour wait for us and there was some pushing and line cutting. The photo queue at the exit was also really annoying. Only 5 computers with all these people leaving. You would think some people say \"screw it\" when they see the craziness and Atlantis lets money walk out the door.Food was quite good for park food. We ate at a place with several types of food near the Neptune pyramid. Asian and hamburgers were really good.There were a ton of lifeguards and the place was quite clean for the people and food everywhere.We tried the monorail exit option. It was 60 AED and there were no taxis at the gateway station. Then we paid 24 AED on the tram back to our Dubai marina hotel. Compared to taxi from Atlantis, we paid over 3X. My husband started wondering if we should have just waited in the hour plus taxi line. Overall the park is really nice but the organization needs a lot of help - taxi, queues, photos, wristband money.... Consider doing the hotel for 1-2 nights and have the free entrance plus no exit issues."

There are no signs when you enter the waterpark so if it's your first time you might feel a little lost but just keep walking together with the others. It would have been nice if they didn't run out of maps!We went here on March 29, a Tuesday, expecting there would be less people but unfortunately there were plenty of people. There was a long queue in the ticket booth. It's really a good idea to book tickets online at least a day in advance to save money (at least 60AED, I think) and the queue is shorter than those with no bookings or better yet stay in the Atlantis hotel for a complimentary entrance to Aquaventure. If you're planning to go to Aquaventure, staying in the Atlantis hotel may actually be less expensive than paying for another hotel plus Aquaventure entrance fee. We couldn't find an empty beach/pool chair in the park. Maybe it's always full throughout the spring break which is the best time to come here when the weather is just right.My daughter who is 145 cm tall and weighs 39 kg was not allowed in Poseidon's Revenge and Leap of Faith because they say she's too light but I didn't see any weight restriction on the website. Because of this she's not raving about aquaventure and thinking maybe we should have gone to Wild Wadi instead.But to be fair, my 7 and 10 year old daughters had an amazing time at the Splashers Area and the river rides. Make sure to walk around and visit the beach area as well. There maybe more vacant spots on the beach and grassy area overlooking the beach. Just bring extra towels or picnic mat if you can."

However, on the positive side the water park is fabulous! There's something for everyone. There's a family section, that people without families don't have to mingle with! There's a lazy river with various sections including the rapids. There are group slides, individual slides and daredevil slides. One slide that ends up under the shark pool. Obviously, being Dubai the weather is pretty much guaranteed so for a break from the slides simply lie back and enjoy the sun. Watch out at the end of the day too, if you're not staying on The Palm then put some thought into your transport back as taxis don't come out this way by chance! The public transport is excellent but you will need to take the journey into account if at the end of the day you have tired children!"

The queue for the 'Leap of Faith' must have taken an hour for an experience that lasted less than 30 seconds!!

I am a boring old git now though so perhaps those younger than me would be happy to queue multiple times for the experience.

I would recommend heading over to the second tower on arrival as everyone tends to stop at the first one which gets quite busy, we did 2 slides at the tower of Neptune on arrival and then headed over to the tower of poseidon which was considerably quieter. We had an enjoyable day and finished it off in the Lost Chambers Aquarium."

Visited Aquaventure with the idea that it would be another typical waterpark, however was pleasantly surprised to see that it catered for all the members of the family, which made it more special and enjoyable as well.The rides had just the right balance of fun and thrill. The water and the whole area was squeaky clean.Had paid for a combo of Towel+Locker for my full family of four & we all used the locker near the entrance itself to change into our swimming costumes, to make the most of the park, We did not carry our towel tickets and therefore could not get one issued inside the waterpark as they insisted on the Towel ticket for the same. Here would like to mention that firstly, no one briefed us to carry the towel ticket. We were under the impression that the band put around our wrist for the locker would be enough to get the towels issued. Secondly it is suggested that all your combos should be embedded in the bar code to enable a hassle free enjoyment without having to worry about the administrative aspects.The rides were very good but the sign posting or briefing of any kind on the type of rides along with the degree of thrill etc was found to be very inadequate.Most of the guests were asking each other and were generally not clear about the type of ride."

My 5 year old daughter also went zip-lining through the park. I didn't expect them to allow her to go given her age, but it wasn't a problem at all. If there's one thing to complain about it's getting off of the palm at the end of the day. The line for taxis extended forever. We were able to get on a shuttle bus to the mall, but it literally took over 2 hours of sitting in traffic to get off of the palm. We had fun, but I definitely wouldn't go back until that traffic/construction situation is resolved."

My 16 yr old son went on the Leap of Faith (alone!) and queued 40 minutes for 10 seconds of ride but said it was brilliant! My husband went on fair few rides with the kids and I sat with the bags but there are lockers there if you are all braver than me ! There's also a zip wire and beach and lots of burger type food places. Good fun for all and great way to keep cool on those hotter days."

Weather was great so really expected long Q's and packed pools but wasn't the case. Went with my friend, we're both 26yo and had a blast. The kids have a great water jungle gym type area and it's mostly adults in the pools! It's not well sign posted though - we came via Metro (from Burjeman area) & tram (22AED for a day ticket which includes the tram) then finally monorail. The monorail runs up the palm and is 25AED return. You can get a taxi up there but we wanted to save a bit of cash and see the views up the palm. The monorail is great for this. When heading towards the water park, sit on the left side of the monorail for the best photo opportunities. When you get off the monorail go down to the (only) exit and take a right then head toward what looks like the main hotel reception. It's through there on the left. We didn't buy tickets in advance - I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND. it's way cheaper and the line is smaller. Still, we waited max 10 min.They charge you extra for towels and lockers and they don't let you take your own drink in. Bags are searched. We took our own towels and just got one locker - they're plenty big enough. Remember sun screen, sun glasses and to wear a one piece if you're a woman. Bikini's seemed to be a bad idea if you like the extreme rides as the water pressure is high and lots of people had sore marks on their backs from the speed! Luckily I wore a one piece and was fine. There's a private beach too - great to swim in and is warm. We waited a maximum of 10 mins in any Q. Even when one of the rides stopped working (the one where the floor dropped out). Unfortunately two of the rides weren't working that day with apparent 'scheduled' maintenance. Very annoying as there was no mention on the website. As others have said - it's pricey, and not just the admission, a paratha snack was 35 AED. Another tip - if you have goggles - take them! Or buy some cheap ones in Dubai (too expensive at Atlantis!). You can also hire a Go Pro on the day - something we didn't realise until we left. The price was about \u00a340 if I remember. Or take your own. Saw lots of people with those under water cameras and the pouches you can put your phone in. Depending how hot it is - take sandals / jelly shoes that won't slip off in the pool because the tiles are HOT. A fantastic day and would go again!"

The rides at Aquaventure are great.... they have some high level thrill rides and a fantastic lazy river which is superb for chilling out on. Overall I rate the rides very highly.However a trip to Aquaventure is not without frustration. In addition to my (fairly expensive) entry ticket, I also paid to borrow a locker and towel. The ticket for the towel was on a paper receipt (in a waterpark!!!), so I had to store this in the locker until I required to use it as the end of the day. However (and there is the frustrating part) - the booth for collecting the towels is another part of the park. So at the end of the day I had go all the way to the changing rooms, get out my paper receipt, turn around and walk all the way back to the pick up my towel. By the time I made it back my friends (who had their own towel) were ready and waiting for me. Annoying!!! The second (and most) frustrating aspect of Aquaventure is getting a taxi outside. The traffic on Palm Island is horrendous. We left fairly early (about 4.30pm) as we were heading straight for our flight at the airport. We waited about 45 minutes to get a taxi and then about another 40 - 50 minutes for our taxi to actually get off the island. We only just made the flight. My recommendation would be to take the monorail off the island and then get a taxi at the monorail station instead."

The average - Apart from maybe three rides, we found them a little tame. Having previously been to a water park in Abu Dhabi we felt that offered far better and more rides than Atlantis. The bad - Finding your way around is not easy, sign posts are hard to follow and there is no indication as to what each ride is, how intense the ride is or where to go for the ride!!! The most frustrating part of it all, when you finish some of the rides it leads you on to a lazy river which you think is the exit.... it is not, you then spend 20 minutes floating around trying to figure out how to get out!! All in all, it is a good day and i am sure if we had children it would receive more stars as very geared towards families.

Possibly because I had no expectations I found this to be the best day of the holidays. We arrived around 11/11.30. In hindsight we should've come earlier as they were open from 10. We had booked online so getting through the entrance was fast and efficient. We chose to base ourselves at the beach on loungers and walk up and down to the park. There were places to sit, with alot of families so we found the beach quieter. We could sunbathe in peace and take trips in and out to the slides. We started of on the bigger slides with the inflatables. These were good fun and an easy start to the day. I dont think it was by design but as the day went on we were progressing to more terrifying slides each time. We went on every slide. The slide which brings you into the aquarium was good to do however compared to the more scary slides it was quite tame. The best 2 slides, and forgive me I cant remember the names, was one where you had to cross your arms across your chest and push yourself off a steep incline. Nothing can prepare you for the terror you feel going in and the high you feel coming out the other end. Another one was where you stand upright in a coffin like box, with a perspex floor beneath you. You have to cross your arms and legs.The glass door closes and counts down from 3 and the perspex floor gives way to a straight drop. It was the most frightening thing, yet the best thing we did all day. It was an excellent day out and highly recommended."

There's something for everyone weather you like a peaceful ride floating slowly in the water or an adrenaline full, fast-paced slides! There's also a beach with sun beds, volley ball fields and soccer goals. For a 100 dirhams fee you get to use the zipper lines the whole day. There's also sharks, rays, fish and dolphins to see! Some of the slides go through the shark-filled tanks, and with an extra payment you get to swim with the dolphins or fee the rays. It's definitely worth the money!!"

My husband had booked the swimming with dolphins experience at this Waterpark as a surprise treat for me as we were in Dubai on honeymoon. The experience was amazing and something I will never forget, it was so special to be up close to such a beautiful animal. You have the opportunity to stroke and have a cuddle with a dolphin, you also get to swim with the dolphin pushing you along. There is a photographer there to take photos to capture your experience, as you are not allowed to take your own cameras into the water with the dolphins. Unfortunately, we didn't like any of our photos but I don't need a photo to remember this once in a lifetime experience.The rest of the water park is excellent, there is something for everyone from the super fast 'drop' water slides, the lazy river which goes on forever and the wave pool. I think we pretty much went on every water slide in this park and they were all really good.A great day out to cool off from the boiling sun in Dubai"

My kids enjoyed and never had enough.The only problem is the time is shorter during this time of the year as the sunset is earlier.. But weather much better than summer. So, come early (10 AM) to avoid queues and if u have a car, park it in the lot then ride the free shuttle ( I could find the parking lot as it was right after Atlantis hotel, now it is before the hotel). Also,book 24 hours before your day of visit through their website to save around 60 Dirham(17$)/ ticket.Everything inside is overpriced, bring everything u need with u.. Water, snacks, swimwear, towels, slippers.Enjoy :)"

            "review": "Fun time @ Aquaventure. First of all be ready to spend some money as you decide on your trip to Aquaventure. if you are resident of UAE,show your Emirates ID and get the discount.You need to leave your car in a separate parking area next to Atlantis and the shuttle bus will take you right into the park. I think its done to avoid rush at the park entrance which is fair and easy for a lot of people. Buses are parked right outside and they shuttle quickly.You need just one day to enjoy this place and if you have been to other water theme parks across the world you will know this one can be finished in just 5 hrs. Drops are there for dare devils,Slides are available for the fun seekers and lazy river with waves are there for people who don't prefer the adrenaline rush just like my friend who wanted to stay in that forever. I found that the slides are covered 30-40% on most of them which was not very great as you cannot 'see' anything to feel the fear factor.When you see the rides go till the edge it creates an excitement, hence a little disappointing on that aspect.I recommend the Zoomerango for all. if you are a couple you may have to sit with others as this ride needs a min. of 5 people (i think) to balance weight. Please hold tight while you are on this ride, it was not advised to us and we felt that if we had not done that we would have fallen out when it goes vertical before the final fall. And please move around the park quickly there is more than one tower and the tower behind is less crowded always. One single major disappointment was that the guards did not allow me to sit behind in all double rides, for some odd reason they prefer the men to sit behind. We asked them why they insist on this and it was advised that its to balance the weight. But we told them that we are both of the same weight 68kgs still they were adamant that men should sit behind. I found that weird.Tip: Carry your own towels, so u can save money.No need to carry shower gels & shampoos, it is provided. Ladies, hair dryer is provided in the wash area so no need of them as well. Carry small & flexible bags which can fit in a locker. Buy one locker first ,see if all your items fit in it ,if not you can still exit and buy the second locker."

            "review": "At least 1 visit required.. Note the essentials that most dont know about!. If you're heading to Dubai for the first time then the Aquaventure Waterpark is a must. Located at the Atlantis Hotel, it is worth seeing what they can do on a man made island. Its just like any other waterpark, water slides, tube rides, lazy rivers with a couple of adrenaline pumping slides thrown in.Points to note:I have to mention these since about 50% people going here dont know this (You'll be surprised!)1. DONT carry any food! I cannot stress this enough. I have seen many people carry bag load of food and the security just doesnt give a damn whether its worth 2 DHS or 200 DHS, they'll simply chuck it in the bin. Water you can carry but food is a strict no. For those of you who can sneak em past the security, good luck.2. Clothing. Most of you know this and have seen numerous articles as well, but i'll repeat. Ladies: You need tight fitting clothing. Swimwear is obviously one of them. But in case you dont own one or are uncomfortable flaunting a bikini, you can wear some tights and a slim T on top and the guards will let you go. They are not much fussy about all that. Its just that you cannot wear lose clothing since it might get you stuck on one of the slides or worse.Guys: Board shorts are completely ok or any other swimwear you desire. You can even wear a singlet on top if you dont want to flaunt that beer belly of yours! Or that hairy chest (I would recommend wear something in the latter case)3. The Park. The Park itself is big and divided into two towers. You'll be surprised to see how many people dont even know the second tower exists. There was a line of about 20 people to get into one of the slides on the first tower and a line of 0 people to get me into a slide on the second tower. So do the math. Its a little walk along the coastline from the hotel Shark Bites (I think thats what the name is) and you'll reach the other one. The famous trap door slide is located there and doesnt matter how scared you are. Do it!Apart from that the waterpark itself is very clean and the staff there quite helpful. Nothing left to say except take all the rides! And I mean all of them. Yes the Leap of Faith too.."

We were 3 persons there and had a lot of fun. There is many guards at the park so don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t swim, it is not needed.There is a minimum weight requirement for many attractions, one in our company got stuck due to her weight being lighter than 50kg. They got her out of the attraction tunnel and it was harmless, but she didn\u2019t understand why she suddenly stopped gliding.Make sure to come early to the park, before 10, to avoid ques and to get most out of the expensive entrance to this park.Because Aquaventure Atlantis is not cheap.265 Dirham for a waterpark of 2 buildings with 4 rides each where food, towels and lockers require additional charges. Totally 8 attractions, if you want to ride the zipline there is additional charges. Then there is a beach to access and a riverride, both included but are not much to conside. Except the entrancefee you gonna need a locker, that would be 70 dirham for the bigger locker that fits 2 bags. 45 per meal food if bought in advance, mediumsize meals unlike what others said on tripadvisor the meals are not that big. So this means at least 400 dirham, then add 300 dirham for each additional person. But if bought at spot the entrance is much higher and 3 persons would probably cost 1000 dirham. Too much money for 8 rides if you ask me, especially compared to other waterparks in other places. But you probably noticed that Dubai is an expensive place and either you are ok with that then just visit the park, or you just may reconsider other places options with better prices around the world.After entering the park it is possible to rent a gopro action cam for 200 dirhams, it is worth using one of those inside there. But it is probably not worth renting it, a better option is to just buy a new one for maybe 400 than renting it. Reconsider that before going to the park, otherwise it will be late to do that after entering."

There are a good mixture of slides of varying inclines, including one where the ground drops out from underneath you!There are a lot of slides where you sit in an inflatable ring, but unlike a lot of waterparks where you have to get out and carry your ring up 5 flights of stairs, at Aquaventure you sit on a conveyor belt in your ring and it takes you back to the top, much more fun!!The lazy river also incorporates some more interesting rapids and other sections that you don't get at many parks.If I had one complaint it would be that there aren't enough slides that you go on without a ring, but you can still happily spend a day here without getting bored."

            "review": "Worth it. So, probably like many, I baulked at the price when pre-booking. But our trip to Aquaventure during the UK February half term holidays was worth it.Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids of 13 and 11) arrived at opening time and were able to use the pre-booked ticket window to check in. We additionally paid for a large locker and loaded some money onto a wrist band for using during our visit to save us trips back to the locker room.Changing rooms were clean. We were glad we'd gone for the large locker as the small ones were really small, but the large locker was just sufficient for 4 people's belongings. Lockers are in the changing rooms so if visiting as a family, bear in mind that if you use one in the ladies changing area, men won't be able to access it and vice versa.The slides are centred around two large towers - the Tower of Neptune and the Tower of Poseidon. We started with the Tower of Neptune as it was closer to the entrance. These slides nearly all require you to carry a rubber 'donut' up the steps. Both single and double rings were available - plenty of both. We enjoyed all of the slides in this area - some have motorised sections which take you up again before bringing you down - one of which can be accessed from the lazy river. The Leap of Faith which takes you through the shark tank takes around 8 seconds. A better view of the sharks and rays is possible from one of the other slides whre you coast gently through the tube on your donut.The lazy river is a great way to get around the park with a good selection of rapids en route. No donuts were necessary at the Temple of Poseidon. Better signposting at the bottom of the steps would be helpful as each of the 4 lines of steps leads into queues for different rides. The family raft rides were lots of fun.We ended up lunching from a food court area near Poseidon. A burger meal cost about \u00a39 - but it was wagyu beef - if you can tell the difference. The fries were good. The eating area was clean but the floor was slippy inside.The crowds were very low in the morning with minimal queues and waits of not much more than 5-10 minutes in the afternoon. So it was a good time to visit. As the sun went lower in the late afternoon, a lot of park was in the shade and it was noticeably cooler.The only downer on our day was the horrendous wait for a taxi at the end. We hit the queue at around 5.15pm (the park closed at around 6.15 that day) and had to wait around 50 minutes for a taxi. There were unpleasant scenes when people at the back of the queue tried to grab taxis dropping people off before the taxis had a chance to pick up the people waiting at the front of the queue. This aspect really needs managing better."

From a country that doesn't boast weather consistently good enough to justify such an ambitious outdoor water creation, I was like a kid in a candy store visiting this place in February heat! An extension of the plastic fantastic monstrosity that is The Atlantis, this place is a buzzing metropolis of shops and eateries on arrival, I'm thankful that we visited on a Sunday, immediately after the weekend (yes, weekends are Friday-Saturday for those of you who might not know) because there were no queues to endure, though the entrance hall looked more than prepared for the regular onslaughts that I'm sure happen frequently. This trickled to eateries and ride access when inside too, with nothing troublesome to enjoy or time consuming to wait for. Yippee! After a pizza and such equally unhealthy snacks (there's aren't too many healthy alternatives I'm afraid), we navigated our was past a trailing looking children's water playground (wish I was a kid again!). Before I launch into the adventure, can I just express my sheer delight I. Double rubber rings?! So much more fun than riding alone and definitely worth holding onto because all the best rides were ring friendly. More yippee's! Every ride ends up in the same river rapids and pool, so go crazy and enjoy the thrill...For the daredevils of you, there are som exceptionally crazy death drops that I didn't try, but if you crave the adrenaline, they looked every bit as terrifying as one would hope them to be! On the other side of the park, yet more ring rides exist and of course, more drops, but nothing quite as dramatic as the death drop (or whatever they call it!). Zip lining can also be found on this, the other side of the park, but I'm afraid that this is at additional cost. Boo! There are plenty of places to bask in the sun by one of many pools or indeed, in their private beach. There are water stands everywhere and plenty of fandom stalls positioned strategically to catch the active snacker - ice cream, popcorn and the suchlike (again, nothing much healthy). A wonderful day out that easily takes up the whole day, worth every penny of floating fun!"

Some amazing rides; the Zoomerango is brilliant. Didn't try the leap of faith looked a bit too scary! We only queued once which was for the ride which goes through the shark tank which was the most disappointing ride of the day (I have always wanted to go to the Aquaventure Waterpark because of this ride so quite probably it is a bit overhyped).Food was the usual stuff; chips, burgers, etc. Overall, a good day out. I thought it was quite expensive; we got a discount because we booked through our hotel and they gave us a voucher to present when we got there. It knocked a third off so if you are not staying at the Atlantis, ask your hotel if they do anything like it. Even with the voucher, for three (kids over 1.2m count as adults) cost \u00a3148!"

I enjoyed it to fullest like a kid. Took all rides, apart from one on Poseidon (the scariest one).It has basically 3 sections, one for kids with lot of kids slides, tower of Neptune and the the tower of Poseidon. It is a full day excursion. Each of these sections have different slides. Tower of Poseidon has done great rides. Do not miss the scariest slides, they are fun. We did this on weekday so it was peaceful no queues. Staff was friendly and nice Some tips:1) they have small and large lockers to keep stuff, which is chargeable. A large locker for about 75 AED. But you can carry bags inside the park and keep it on slide while you enjoy rides.2) The food inside is expensive, you cannot carry own food3) Only kids of a particular height, i think above 3 feet are allowed in Neptune and Poseidon4) Do not recommend this park for old people as to take rides on Neptune and Poseidon, one has to climb stairs for each ride with the tube5) there is also a beach there which can be enjoyed.6) the changing rooms are equipped with soap, shampoo and hairdryerIf you are also doing Lost chamber, do it after the rides, as the park is closed at 6, but Lost chamber is open till 6pm"

We rented Baracuda 2 cabana for the day. The cabana was provided with four loungers, table and four chairs, a hammock, 2 fat boys, towels, coolbox with complimentary water, complimentary fruit bowl, and waiter service for food.The downside of our day was when we tried to leave at 5pm via taxi. Due to roadworks and heavy traffic, it took an hour to travel down the Palm frond away from the main trunk and back past Aquaventure to take the tunnel back to the mainland.

The kids really liked it but we were happy that the weather was cloudy, otherwise beware of the sun. The attractions are fun but very few are good for smaller children. If you dare try the waterslide, otherwise try the attractions with the small tires.The prices of food and beverages are really expensive - I mean a burger costs 25 USD -.Because we stayed at the Palm Atlantis hotel, we had free access to the park.Avoid the beach, it is not worth the effort."

Very less people working in a particular attraction. The hopelessness was that my wife got stuck in the ride that had a drop followed by the tube (poseidon's revenge) as they call it. First we were waiting at the top to hear something. but the staff didnt mention to us what had happened. Second the ride has a 360 degrees turn which makes it more dangerous and third there was no apology or any sort of regret for getting stuck. A person getting stuck in the tube can be very dangerous. But the staff just laughed off (\" you got stuck\") what the hell does that mean. DIDNT expect such sort of service in atlantis. Would recommend to stay away from poseidon's revenge ride."

General - This water park is by far the best water park in Dubai, and the UAE - BETTER THAN YAS WATER WORLD (See Yas review)The park is set on the palm and attached to The Atlantis Hotel and everything seems to have been thought of and planned for excellently so that the park and your visit runs smoothly.I have visited in the heat of summer (August 15) and also during the busier period of December and January and on both occasions had a great time. The August visit provided a quieter and less busy experience, but you then also have to deal with the extreme heat that the Dubai sun provides. This is not a problem as you are constantly in and out of the water and the ques for rides are not at all bad and you get to go on rides multiple times throughout the day.Suggestion - One thing the park could do to help improve customer experience is use a small sprinkler system around the park for the paths that customers walk on. During the summer months the floors are sooooo hot that you have to walk around with your flip flops on and hook them on during the rides. In parks I have visited in the USA they have sprinklers on the paths so that some / all of the path your walking on from ride to ride does not burn your feet.Rides - The rides here are excellent and cater for a wide range of thrill seekers. There are some really good group rides (that could be slightly longer) and also some very good individual slides that in general you dont have to que up for too long - maximum queuing time I have experienced on both visits was about 15 minutes. The space in which the rides are spread out across is also very good - even if on first visit you dont realise there is whole other area to visit.Beach - The attached beach area is an excellent area to chill out on when not on slides and also provides a good area to base your towels and bags. The sun beds around the lazy river are very busy and also there are alot of children based here. Food - The food establishments at Aquaventure are excellent. If you visit the food court then you are able to order a range of cuisines and the food here is cooked fresh - for example we had some Thai food and was lovely. Reasonably priced for theme park food also.Overall - Excellent water park with great rides, set up and provides for a range of customers. Only shame is that they dont have a flow rider / body board machine as does Wild Wadi."

We had to choose between Wild wadi, yas island and this. We chose Acquaventure mainly because it was in the Palm, Atlantis hotel. There were two towers with some great rides such as leap of faith, Shark attack and many more. May be about 15 rides in these two towers. We did many rides but skipped a few which we thought were too risky. There were several lazy rivers for you to settle and some nice areas for you to relax. There is a nice beach which is clean and no crowd. Restaurants were good but everything was exorbitantly priced. You couldn't really find a place for cheaper or less priced food or merchandise. Overall this is certainly a good water park you must visit. However it could have been made a little more active and happening with some more activities apart from two towers."

I would recommend starting with the 'leap of faith' which is in the first tower. It is a steep slide (prob 80 degrees), the rides get progressively more exciting as you go through the park. You can pet dolphins and Rays but they come at an extra cost of approx $100 each. Being in a 7 star hotel the cost of the food, drinks, etc. is quite high so I would suggest you eat well and go there. 4-5 hours are needed to complete the full park. They have locker facilities as well so don't worry about having to leave you phone etc behind. For those who want to relax a bit, the park has its private beach as well. For those visiting Dubai for the first time, I would strongly recommend visiting this park. Fully worth the money. Thanks. "

We went there on the monorail which runs frequently and takes you right there."

The biggest killer was that NO BATHROOMS were working the entire morning and we weren't allowed to use the ones in the hotel lobby either. They told us this AFTER we paid and made our way in. What made it worse was that the staff kept telling us to go different places to find a working bathroom but all of those weren't working either. Thank god they were fixed just after 1 PM as it is a water park and people will find a place to use the bathroom one place or another. The Lazy river pretty much connects everything. You can spend a good 2 hours in there after one of the rides, get off and do the other rides, followed by more relaxing in the river. Water park tube rides are always super fun. Showers and changing rooms with lockers are easy and convenient"

Considering you have to buy everything there once you're inside I would say entry is a bit on the expensive side especially as you could just spend your day by your own hotel pool but I guess its about average for a theme/attraction. Its pretty easy to navigate your way around. There is an area for small children which is away from the main slides so if you're older looking for fun you don't get slowed down by families, equally if you're there with little ones, you can enjoy the children's area without getting pushed about my teenagers heading towards the more hair-raising slides!A few dos and don'ts that we didn't realise before we went- definately if you can go on a week day (Sun - Thurs) it was just so relaxed, hardly had to wait for any slides and had the pick of sun loungers even though we didn't get there until almost lunch time- get hold of an Entertainer voucher from a friend/local if possible - someone will get in for free!- head out to the beach area as well as the sun lounger areas - lovely views back towards the city (Burj al Arab, Marina etc)- don't take any food or drink with you - there was no moving on this so literally had to put all we took in the bin"

There is a children's area but not appropriate for toddlers or over 10's.We all thought the water park was expensive.

We arrived 15 minutes before the opening time because we were let in early, having booked a cabana (at AED900 - which is very expensive). Ours was in a quiet corner of lagoon 2 which was a 5 minute walk away from the main tower with the leap of faith and five other rides. Since we arrived early we practically had the first 3-4 slides to ourselves, despite it being a weekend in Dubai. Even for the other tower and slides we only queued for about 15 minutes or so. The cabana for four is great, you have your own secluded area, a cabana with four chairs (and towels), a table, then outside the cabana a Fatboy hammack, two Fatboy bean bags with a small table, four lounge sun recliners with mattrasses and towels on then, private access to the paddling pool which feeds into the lagoon trail which surrounds the water park. When you factor in the 12 free cooled water bottles and complimentary large cooled fruit bowl you understand why people are prepared to pay such a huge amount for a cabana (in the west coast of the USA we paid USD100 for a cabana for 20!). We had no regrets, though, since our butler Prakash looked after us very well and it was nice to have space and be in a quieter part of the park, compared to all the other people which were stacked sunbed next to sunbed."

It is not cheap so ensure you arrive at the time of opening and stay until you are thrown out! Rides are varied and that is in type and level of adrenalin producing! Anyone over 1.2 meters tall pay an adult price so it is expensive for families. The park has different attractions and having three children 10, 12 and 14 their demand was for water slide action so the day was spent on amazing water slides and rides. This was mid February and although temperatures are a good Summer's day in Britain the water and shade could feel chilly. However sunny it is so some skin protection is needed. As I have said there are many attractions with meet the dolphins,ray fish and sea lions. One day is not enough so this other exciting side to this water park has been promised for another day. Park is impeccably clean, food is available and the staff are polite cheerful and plentiful making you feel confident about safety of the children and yourself if you are not too sure in water."

This is perhaps understandable if they don't want litter and picnicking everywhere but only if the options available are reasonably priced and of an acceptable quality. Sadly this just isn't the case here which is disappointing when the whole complex is touted as 6 or 7 stars. It just seemed cheap and smacked of greed and control. Disappointing. The hot dogs my 2 kids had were about \u00a310 each and bore no resemblance to the delicious looking images of the food at the food outlet.

This included lunch and access to the aquarium as well.I feel this price was quite steep but then this is Dubai so not unexpected. In return we got a really nice day out! There are many facilities and we felt that as a couple we preferred this to wild wadi. There were plenty of sun beds available we were able to leave out towels and then go and explore.The water slides are great for couple because almost all can be done in a double tube. The rapids allow you to float about leisurely and decide which rides you want to take without getting out. You can access almost all rides from here. My and my fianc\u00e9e highly recommend the aquarium slide that goes through the shark tank. I would also say this is good for families as there are many rides but also access to beach, volleyball, peddle boats and zip line.Overall a great day out. Expensive outlay means no 5 stars from us but truly an unforgettable time."

For the tower of neptune it got the leap of faith and most of the river rides, the leap of faith look more scary that it is therefore is worth a try. But the river rides is a bit confusing as the entry is a bit confuse we need to keep asking for direction as there are one river rides which is not in the tower itself, also be prepare as your bottom will be bumping on the slides as the water wasn't too deep the best way it to lift your bottom higher during rides to avoid injury. Entry is not back to found beside one for the tower of neptune but is where you exit is the problems as you always end back up in the river and you need to almost go around half the river before you can get back to the entry of the rides..Where as the tower of poseidon the entry is a bit more confuses im glade there are some staff there as there are about 5 rides entry in 1 you need ask which is which as there are no direction on which is which. but the good side is that the exit is very close to the entry therefore you can very easily going back into the queue.If you are going as family it will be great as the rides are suitable for different age group if they are a bit older you can just let them go wild and enjoy the sun on one of the sun bed yourself, but be prepare to get woken up by noises if you are sensitive."

He loved the rapids and didn't want to do anything else so for us it was perfect but after walking around he would have been too small for most other rides. The pools are really clean and its really well organised. You get a wrist band that you can load money onto for food and drinks and also one for your locker. You can leave all your belongings in a locker and you literally don't need anything else with you all day. You can hire towels and life vests for little ones. There are plenty of sunbeds and shades around all the pools and also on the beach. There are various gift shops. Food was quite expensive and not many healthy choices but we ordered a pizza and a club sandwich and they were both quite good. Our little one loved the shark tank and watching the rays. Locker rooms have showers and hair dryers etc so everything you need has been thought of and I would highly recommend it for a good day out."

After reading many reviews regarding the aquaventure we have been all the family for a funny day.First of all take with you the towels from your hotel because they will charge you 20 aed for each towel.After payed for the safe ( if you have money,credit card or bags is much better take it) we finally walk in to the park.It's huge and you need to be ready to wait for your ride.Personally we loved the rapid river which go all around the park through fast river and then slow again.The kids and your wife probably they will be lovers of aquaconda (try it!) I agree.So if you want spend one day in relax you need to be ready to spend a lot of money this is the right place.One thing be careful with sunglasses or phone mobile take a case waterproof.Highly recommended"

This meant we were the first into the park, first to get chairs and enjoyed literally no lines on any rides for about an hour and half. Walked onto all the rides with no wait during time- it was awesome! The park filled up by noon and lines formed at the popular rides but not too bad given it was the off season. The leap of faith and Poseidon's Revenge are both good slides for thrill seekers. The big tube rides at the tower of Neptune also provide a bit of an adrenaline rush. The park is very clean and the staff are very friendly. Our 9 year old loved all the rides and had a great day- be aware that if you are not 1.2 meters tall there isn't a lot to do other than ride the lazy river. The one complaint we had was that the signage is not adequate and we found ourselves having to try to figure out our way around a few times as the park area is actually quite large- staff were helpful though. The consession food is typical theme park food- just OK and over priced. It's not a cheap day but it is worth it."

            "review": "Thrilling water fun. Aquaventure water park is attached to the Hotel Atlantis in Palm Jumeirah and provides many rides for all ages to enjoy. Being in-house guests of Hotel Atlantis, the entry to water park was free for us. If you are staying in the Imperial club room, then you can get the entry wrist band from the Imperial lounge to avoid the queue at the park. You can then walk into the waterpark by flashing the wrist bands. Towels are provided free for in house guests and you can carry water from the room. Lockers are charged at 40AED and they are big enough to stuff quite a lot of things (There is a bigger locker if you pay more). The Waterpark is spread over a huge area with a long and winding lazy river. The river is quite interesting and provides different experiences. At some places, it is a calm river that moves very slow and at others it is a gushing stream that takes you on a fast ride. Kids have a separate play area with multiple options of slides and water falls. There are a lot of staff who ensure the safety of visitors. Artificial beaches and wave pools provide ample space to relax and have fun. There are many high-thrill rides for adults in the Tower of Poseidon and Tower of Neptune. A couple of pain points - 1) You need to carry the gear all the way up by climbing stairs for every ride and 2) Quite a few of the rides are for couples (If you have a young kid and one of the adults need to stay with him, then you cannot do many rides). Shark attack is highly recommended as you come down below a shark infested aquarium and you can see the sharks swimming above you. There is also a serene beach towards the inside of the palm (overlooking Burj-Al-Arab). One can either walk to the water park from the east side of Atlantis or take the hotel buggy from the pool at the west side to get to the park. Overall, a very good water park where you can easily spend about a day (If you are in a hurry you can do most of the rides in about 3 hours)"

If you are a guest with the Atlantis hotel it is free entry, towels are also free; but you must pay for a locker if you want it.

There is a beach with sun beds and sun beds all over the park, there is a kids play park which is also fun for adults, a lazy river you float around in tubes, Rapids and wave machines which you use tubes for and many rides.The water around the whole park is shallow and doesn't require you to know how to swim, all slides go into shallow pools of maybe 1.2m depth. The lazy river and swimming pools are about 1.5m deep. I am 5ft6 and never had water above my chest. The only place the water can get deep is the wave machines in the lazy river, the waves are deep but take one second to pass and there is around twenty seconds between waves. You have a tube to hold onto anyway. So non-swimmers can also have fun.There are showers with all toiletries and changing rooms also. You can use the waterpark for free on your checkout day from the hotel. We found it was a good place to spend the final day as our flight was at night; so we enjoyed our day then could shower and be fresh for travelling to the airport."

If you are exhausted from the slides you can easily relax at the white sand beach too at the side of the park! It worth to ask for a ticket with the entrance to the aquarium as well . Huge tank with billions of fishes take you to enjoy a special underwater world."

Then we went to one of the towers that required you to walk up a lot of flights of stairs, and were too tired to do it more than once.I would recommend doing the towers first, and then the lazy river. The towers have some of the most incredible, and thrilling rides I have ever seen. I can only imagine how great this place would have been on a sunny day, and if we had more time!

You have 3 different sections and you get to do a whole bunch of stuff (it's a LOT of walking and climbing stairs...by the way, so be prepared).I recommend you get there by 11 or so, if you want to take photos etc. We got to the slides by around 1pm and finished everything by 4:30pm. Post lunch we had some time to spare around the wade pool. But my poor husband didn't get a chance to take any photos.The 2 Towers are easy enough to navigate your way through. The \"lazy river\" is a bit tricky though - you have to keep your eyes peeled so you don't miss anything...we almost did :)Bring down the family...or enjoy it as a couple...it's heaps of fun...if you're with the right company :DP.S. - I highly recommend you take the pass that includes the food voucher - meals cost more than double the amount compared to a regular mall."

The plus side of this visit was that the staff was very friendly, and in general it was a fun experience (nothing out of the ordinary, definitely not the 'best waterpark in the Middle East and Europe' as it claims to be). We went exactly when they closed off one of their 'towers'. We were warned about this at the entrance to be fair. However, we were shown one ride on what looked like a large map and told that one was closed. This was fine, one of many rides, right? When we went in, we realised that there are really only two 'towers', each containing a few rides. Essentially, half of the park was closed down and yet the full admission fee was charged. To me, this is equivalent to robbery. There is no respect for the customer. We felt cheated. If half of your water park is out of order, you should not be charging the full admission fee. The rides were alright - nothing special, nothing you can't find at most water parks. The price was too steep for what we had, and too steep in general I feel. Oh, you aren't allowed to bring outside food, so you're forced to pay like three times what you would normally pay for a small pizza in the food court in case you're starving. I wouldn't recommend it - there are better ways to spend your money and probably better water parks too."

Give yourself lots of time to get there with the metro, then a tram, then the monorail - all of which give you a chance to see the area and get a view of the Palm Island. Then it's a bit of a hike to the waterpark.Then - even though it's not a busy day or peak time - you'll wait in a long line, whether you've pre-purchased your ticket online or not. Because when you reach the head of the line, you'll have to make additional purchase decisions about locker rentals, meals, etc. practically blind. I already had some idea about the prices, etc., from reading the website and these reviews, but I also had time to go to the other side, where there were more details posted. Be aware that the lockers are inside the dressing rooms, so you have to plan if you want to share with someone of the opposite sex. You can put money on your cashless wristband and get a refund of what's left at the end of the day. There was no lineup for that when we went for the refund. My guess is that they profit on those who forget or can't be bothered with another lineup.And I'm jaded like that because of one thing: you save money by pre-purchasing online, right? Always a bit of a risk in case someone is sick or the weather is bad, but okay. Except here's the thing: they offer good meal deals to on-the-spot ticket buyers which are NOT available to the online purchasers. So we ended up paying more for food than the others. GRRRRR We ultimately saved only a measly sum and the goodwill is GONE.Onward to the fun part - but the maps are not very good. You don't know where you're going or what the attraction is. You cannot see much, if anything, so you don't know whether or not it's something you want to do. I'd looked at everything online, but who remembers them all?So you walk around in a bit of a daze for awhile, until you figure out that you're supposed to find a tube somewhere, and keep it with you. It can take awhile to get one. There's a weight limit for double tubes - so be aware. A lot of people didn't realize it.We went on one ride that slammed us around a bit - and yes, it shook me up and hurt. I shudder to think if it had been my head that got slammed. And that wasn't even a ride known for being a wild one. After that we were much more cautious and actually afraid to try much because there was so little information. Staff tried to be helpful, but without standard ratings, it's often a matter of interpretation. Some people love the wild rides. I want to know - just how wild is it?It's the only time that we have not loved a waterpark. Plus there's the bad taste left about feeling a little ripped off over the pre-purchase deal/no deal on food scam."

After spending half a day in this great place my opinion changed: I love waterparks, at least this one. The rides are super fun ranging from exploring the relaxing river track in a giant inflatable donut to the super scary free fall (which is a lot of fun!!). We were there on a Friday and there were no or just very short queues. I don't know if that is the case every Friday but not having to wait for the rides too long and the relaxing atmosphere made our visit to Aquaventure an awesome experience!"

If a family of four are planning to visit this park , it makes sense to book a night's stay in the Hotel Atlantis itself if you get the room for around 500 USD as the entry to the park and the lost chambers is free. If you do the math it is a good bargain."

They charge you around \u00a310!to buy the refillable bottle but then you pay extra \u00a35 every time you refill.I would personally not go and save my money as it was ok place but nothing special.Don't forget to bring a towel as they charge for that and for lockers.

We were a little disappointed when we arrived to find out that that one of the main towers was closed, which ruled out around 4 of the water slides for the day. We did receive a small discount for this but we paid on the day (not sure where people who booked in advance stood with this). We book the ticket which includes the park entry fee, a meal, and access to the aquarium. We thought that this was worth the extra. The meal was a decent size and tasted good (and the aquarium after was also really good). While we were in the Waterpark we were also informed that a few more slides we're currently closed but would open again later (this was in addition to the already closed tower). All in all this meant that we really didn't get to go on as many slides as we had planned throughout the day. I think this would be an enjoyable day out (more so if all of the rides were open), but we spent about 5 or so hours here in the end. Worth doing once, but for the price I probably wouldn't visit a second time."

We used the online booking system and paid prior to arriving. We were informed upon arriving entry that Poseidon's tower was closed for private use for the day. Having already paid for tickets and transport there, as well as not realising how much was part of the tower (we assumed it was one ride and soon found out the major water rides in the park were all on this tower). There is far too much of this in Dubai, people with too much money for their own good who have no regard for other's interests (we even overhead one guy book one of the few open rides out for an hour; what about everyone else in the park?)Compared to waterparks elsewhere in the world the rides are not groundbreaking, they last 5 seconds. The one tower that was open kept shutting off 75% of the rides throughout the day which was frustrating on top of the rest. The rides in Poseidon's tower did however look great including the world's biggest water ride. To summarise:- - If when I went to book online they explained half of the park was off limits so customers fully understand, I would not have booked and waited for another day. Or at least offered a reduction off full price considering the major attractions were off limits."

Poseidon's Revenge and Leap of Faith were the only two rides that give you the creep! Those two are crazy and you'll love them if your are a thrill seeker. Others are for leisure and good if you want to spend some good time with your better half or kids. I've rated the water park 3 but the whole trip to the Atlantis, the view, the beauty will add another star to its rating! It's a good place to go to!

Ok so I can't honestly say I can review the rides however I would have liked to, but with queues to even buy tickets of over an hour, we calculated that with the volume of people and the number of rides that the queues inside would be worse (we heard from others, that persisted with the queue, that we were right), so sadly after getting all excited ans waiting over an hour and the queue only moving a little.over half way we decided to leave the queue.The only thing I will say was that it was eid, so would explain large numbers however the organisation and crowd control was terrible, barely any staff presence, no indication of waiting times and the entrance prices had been raised in honour of the holiday- very disappointing."

If you book online you actually save a huge amount of money and it is very easy to book. Staff at ticket counter are not very helpful. I had booked snorkeling online for the family and directions given from the start sent me all over the place before I actually found out I was supposed to be at the Lost Chambers and this came from a non-staff person. Almost missed our time slot due to having walked a fair distant away from the Lost Chambers before we had to return. The snorkeling is awesome and the kids thoroughly enjoyed it (staff here are very friendly, engaging and helpful). Lost Chambers itself is a good combo of sea life which kids will love. I like the carpet and cushion seats in front of all the big tanks so that you can relax and watch the fish.Good fun for kids and adults alike. The rides are thrilling and some not for the feint-hearted. Food and confectionery is very expensive. The towel and locker combo is ideal but alone works out to a lot. The loungers by the pool areas are easy to come by and safe to leave your things and come back. Although being the festive season as well as the shopping festival period the park closed at 5 which was a bit disapppointing. We went in January and although the weather was a bit cold, it wasnt overly busy and ques for rides were not long which was good but I think it was because we went on Sunday."

They are also situated in the ladies and gents toilets so keep that in mind. Signage in the park is not great but you can stumble around and find out what is where!!Onto the advice!- most rides need a tube so find a double or single depending what you would like and hang on to it for as long as you want to ride be in the water. The aquarium is not great at all. Very small. We went through it in about 15 mins. Don't buy coffee inside by the locker rooms as its not great at All. Leaving the place best to Hope onto the tram and get off the palm them grab a taxi. Complete chaos trying to leave when the water park closes at 5:45.

Decided to skip the queue so paid to have a deck chair, the cabanas were sold out. There was a locker inlcuded, 6 water bottles and some fresh fruit served. The kids enjoyed the rides and leap of faith. When leaving at 5 pm, found that the only showering facility is near the entrance and it was a huge hassle to get the buggy to the front. There were many people rushing for the shower facilities as everyone got out the same time. After that a queue of about 100 people for the taxi. So I guess do expect that when visiting in December."

Last time we visited Dubai our relatives too us to a waterpark (Dreamland) about 1 hour out of town, as the park was supposed to have more for younger kids (some of our kids were under 120cm at the time), and it was cheaper. Dreamland was OK but pretty much like every other waterpark we've ever visited. Aquaventure is a different experience entirely, and completely worth the cost! Kids (aged 6 and 8) loved the lazy river, as it had so many different avenues of adventure. We liked the Leap of Faith (although like might be the wrong word), as well as the other flumes on that section. The wait time was max of 20 mins, and we seemed to be there on a busy day (NYE).Also, if it is your bday, sign up on the website, and you get free entry in your bday week (just remember to print out the voucher they email you, as they don't accept it if just on your smartphone etc). I would also recommend buying the meal deal. We were told the food wasn't great, but were pleasantly surprised with the options offered at the Baracuda section of the waterpark. It's at the back, so not as crowded as the one near the little kids water section towards the front, has better options, and lots of seating."

The place was crowdy and we had to queue for about an hour in, although we had bought our tickets already online. The locker system was weird and it took a while to actually get the locker. There was no information about the system or how it works. But, the rides were great like the staff too. It would have been nice to know where each slide is and to know, what kind they are. The Aquaventure beach was a beautiful place to relax, but there was a little bit too much rocks in the sand.The food at Shark Bites was expensive, like always in places like this. The worst was getting out from this place. There were no taxis in front of the exit, and there was a huge queue to taxi, even though no taxis came there. We decided to go with the Monorail. Inside the place where we had to buy the tickets for the ride it was chaos. Only one of the three ticket automats was working and there was no staff behind the information desk. There was hundreds of people trying to get a ticket. Luckily, we got a ticket and got in the train pretty fast. I think that Aquaventure is an amazing place to visit with kids or friends. I would go again if I had the chance. But there is also many things that need improvement!"

Now the thought of screaming kids, smelly flip flops, soppy towels, endless queues and fights for sun loungers may not sound that appealing, however if you have had a water park experience before and the aforementioned brings back negative memories, well perhaps this one can change them. The park is huge with so many areas to decamp and leave your things, ride queues at least before 2pm were negligible and moderate, ie. 15 minutes post this time. The rides are excellent, modern, clean and fun for all family members. But if you are like me you will just want to sit in your inflatable and go round the lazy river. Now lazy river gives the impression that nothing really happens except sitting in your ring and drifting around at a slow and cumbersome pace, well sorry not at this park. This is a 45 minute round the park journey which includes conveyor belts and rapids. It was really awesome. We spent 6 hours there with no problems at all. One tip, we left at 4.30pm, and the taxi queue was pretty long, so I would suggest either organize a car or grab one of the executive black taxis which will cost you about double the standard ones. A small cost to ensure the day was not tainted at the end. Have fun and remember it is OK to become a kid for the day!!"

There are better water parks in Dubai not to say that this is not good. But people come to Aquaventure to get inside Atlantis premises. The rides are good and some of the rides look extreme dangerous for weak hearted. All the food stalls are damn expensive. A Veg Burger costs 50 dirhams which is equivalent to US$ 14 or INR 950.You can book private Cabanas or you can rest on General Cabanas spread all across Aquaventure. But a nice place to enjoy a day out"

The park had a delayed opening due to the rain, but there was limited communications about when they would open the doors. Finally the park opened over a hour late.We had pre-booked online - I would NOT recommend doing so, as you can get a discounted tickets on your way through the airport. Also, while tickets are good for 4 months, they DO NOT refund, even in the event of park closure. The response we got was \"come back tomorrow\" - which was an impossibility for us, as we only had one day in Dubai.The park is well laid out, but poorly signed - making it confusing to get from place to place. There is one tower that requires the use of tubes - but they are not stocked anywhere near the ride entrance. The staff just pointed to the \"beach\" area of the rapids ride and said \"get tubes there\", meaning you had to haul them a long way.We met others in the park who had been the day before - telling us of 45 minute waits for rides. Since the weather was bad, we had no lines. If we had to wait, the park would be a complete waste of money - limiting you to about 9 rides in 7 hours of opening time. Food in very expensive and you have carry money in the park. Where as Water Bomb in Bali has bracelets you can put value on and get a refund of unused funds at the end of the day, making it really convenient to purchase food.While we had a good experience, we would not return."

Hassles of carrying personal swim tubes (available free however) could have been avoided but for management being more pro-active towards understanding the inconvenience of carrying 1-2kgs of 1mtr wide tubes across 2-4 floorsBut net of net clean water, takes a while to understand the park & facilities....very expensive food & souvenirs"

We paid 300AED each for a day pass (which included a tour of the Lost Chambers aquarium) and whilst it was one of the better water parks I've visited, its clear the price is highly driven by the Atlantis Hotel as one of the more recognisable Land marks in Dubai. Changing facilities very clean and as you expect lots of fun, the rapids were great and even though it rained on our visit the water was warm enough. Not unlike similar attractions you couldn't take your own food and the price to get something to eat was at least double what you pay for similar food in other areas of Dubai. The staff were friendly and helpful, you can also access a public beach and sit and relax on a sun lounger if available. We also paid an extra 50AED for a locker and towel each which was probably the most cost effective part of the trip. Word of warning however, please ensure you have booked a taxi or using public transport (such as the monorail) when leaving the park as the only taxis available outside are in high demand and are Black Lexus cabs who charge you double what you would pay with a normal Taxi. Enjoyed the day, but wouldn't do it again for the cost. "

There is also a locker area near the barracudas cafe which is close to the Poseidon's tower. Did most of the slides 2x as no lineup during the first hours. Should have bought my ticket online as it is cheaper if book online or better yet book a night with the hotel and the waterpark access is free. Looking back I am thinking that we should have just book a night there so no need to hurry out because if you leave the park together with other guest it might be hard to get taxi going back to mainland Dubai. I also explored the beach area which is quite good but the water is cold. The river rides are good and has many options for one to choose so definitely a good thing for those who aren't thrill seekers. If I could get a good price for a night stay then I would say this is an excellent experience."

However there are certain rides that require rings and there is no specific place where you can get these from you have to just find them around the park. Also there are no clear signs to where certain rides are. Furthermore there is not a lot of people around the water park that can assist you when you need help so you have to find your way around yourself. Lastly something I realised is that is not very disability friendly. Overall I think it's an average water park, I prefer alton towers and Thorpe Park!"

It is smaller than Aquaventure Water Park, but for us this was good since we were tired and didn't want to walk a lot. Like other places in Dubai, they have you put a \"credit\" on your credit card when you buy your admission so that you can use it for various size lockers, towels, souvenirs and food. They give you a wrist band and scan it for all of these charges so that you don't have to carry your wallet. If any credit is not used, they will refund it via AED (good for taxi fare) when you check out to leave (don't forget to do this! - it is an extra step).

Unfortunately, we've definitely been to better water parks and it doesn't beat our favourite, which is Siam Park in Tenerife.On the day that we visited, it wasn't too busy which meant that we didn't have to queue to enter the park and we hardly had to queue for the rides. We paid for one locker as we had brought one bag between us but there are no mixed locker areas which meant one of us had to wait outside the changing rooms for the other etc. Not really a big deal, and a lot of couples seemed to be in the same boat. The lockers are also at the entrance of the park and as it is quite large, I'd advise taking everything that you are going to need with you.We eased ourselves in to the park on the rapids and what became apparent quite quickly was how cold the water was! It was freezing on what wasn't an overly hot day (early-mid 20s). We ended up taking a dip in the sea which was much warmer, although the beach area in general wasn't that great.The park was split into two main areas, Tower of Neptune and Tower of Poseidon. It isn't very well signposted and we only came across the Tower of Poseidon in the afternoon, which has the most thrilling rides. The rides at the park on the whole are good (although the water was freezing!) and Poseidon's Revenge was simultaneously the best and worst water park ride I've ever been on!! It was terrifying! Check out the Youtube videos (or maybe don't!) before you ride!We enjoyed our trip, but next time we visit Dubai, we\u2019ll definitely give Wild Wadi a go instead.Just one final thing to note, if you take a GoPro, you can take it on all rides but only if you have it on a wrist strap. Selfie sticks and poles etc are not allowed."

Worth using ones near a restaurant. Remember to get a wrist band on all the rides to get your photos on the rides at the end. We missed a few so couldn't find some of our photos.

Note there are are a few different eateries and it's worth checking out where the best ones are located e.g. Near the Poseidon rides.Afternoon meant some wanted a more peaceful relaxation on the beach there.However it's reasonably close to Poseidon where there's more excitement including the highest ride where gramps survived a heart stopping drop as a trap door was opened under his feet.Don't miss it but go early to find a less busy area to sit in.Beach is quiet most of the time, but a bit away from the rides."

They rent towels for an expensive rate.- Locker rent is also a bit steep. 40 DHS for small / 75 DHS for large. Small locker usually does the job.- Eat well before your enter. If you are hungry, you may not be carrying money and wont be able to buy anything.- Make sure you do the POSEIDON ride.

I wasn't looking forward to going here as I thought it would be too crazy/manic but I was wrong.Yes it was busy but there was ample places to find a sun lounger if required or the beach connected to the park was virtually empty so could find some quiet time there.I loved the rubber dingy's that you could sit on and go on a long loop around without getting off. It meant you could chill out on the water and go places without ant real effort, taking you back to where you started was pretty cool.There was plenty of food places in the park although I was slightly disappointed there wasn't many healthier options. It was all very poor food choices.You can park you car in the car park next to the Atlantis and get the bus to the entrance. I would say that if arriving at peak time (pretty much anytime after opening) the queues to get your ticket (regardless of whether you had paid online before) takes quite a while and is a little frustrating.

The thing to notice is the sheer number of support staff, at almost every 200 metres. You cannot get lost, or be in trouble, as help is at arm's length, everywhere. We tried the rides of Tower of Poseidon, quite nice. The place was not too crowded, hence no long queues. That was great. The dolphin show was good as welbl. One needs full day to do all the rides..not just a few hours. Do carry swimwear and towels, as it would help. Although it is available on hire, at a rental. Worth a visit, if you are in Dubai!"

I did the lazy river which was nice, you sit in the float thing and it takes you around the water park . There are also a number of pool lounge areas to relax by with sun deck chairs available.My husband did all the rides and there wasn't too much of a queue . He seemed to enjoy it but the main qualm he had was that it was very confusing to get around which is true . The signage for the rides are very poor. The map is also very poor, it doesn't explain what each ride is and so you won't know whether it is for thrill seekers or not . And also majority of the time you need to have your float with you which it doesn't state in the leaflet . Again it could be better explained in this. The water was also very cold especially for this time of the year and I guess part of me thought it would be heated or at least the pool areas but they are not . There are many lifeguards and members of staff present which is great to see. You cannot take food in, so my husband and I had food outside and then came back in as we couldn't seem to find something to suit us and didn't want to walk for long trying to find the different restaurants as they are scattered around the water park . Food is pricey but to be expected for Atlantis.In terms of drinks you cannot bring this in, although I do think they should allow you to bring water and bottled soft drinks as it is expensive .The locker rooms are well maintained but again pricey , bring your own towels otherwise you will have to pay . The beach area is lovely and relaxing, the water again was cold for this time of year , although as my husband and I got closer we could smell the sea water and it smelt a lot like sewage water so decided against paddling in . Overall a good day out and not sure we'll come back, maybe next time we'll try a different water park just to see what others are like but well worth visiting . Atlantis itself is stunning and you do need to take a cab if you are not staying there, the line for the can to get back was huge."

We visited today, a Tuesday, as we read that is the least crowded day and that seems to be correct as we never had to stand in line for any ride. Also we arrived a few minutes before 10 AM which of course helped...Everything works very well but the ticketing is painfully slow so make sure you buy your tickets in advance or get a voucher from your hotel!If I were to rate the rides, cleanliness, and overall experience this review would be a five star one. The rides are great and we had a blast!We had added money to our wrist bands for food and drinks inside which is very convenient. At leaving you will be able to cash back the remaining amount, however this is where the one star comes...Upon leaving we had to us her all the kids out and trying to get all our belongings with us at which time a \"friendly\" staff come and ask if we want to remove and trash our wristbands. Stressed with packing up we said sure, please, and he helped getting them off and threw them in a trash can with about 1000 other bands.This is where it hit us, we had money remaining on the bands!There was no use trying to find them in the trash... They where gone... About 400 AED in the trash...Exiting the reception area we heard another couple who had done the same mistake, the staff had taken their wrist band with money remains as well.This feels a bit fraudulent to get the bands while we are busy with other things. It would be much better service with a big sign with \"Don't forget your money\"!Well, we had a really good time, but with a bad ending..."

Each adventure was placed far apart and getting round was not easy. The buggy's that took people around were only for Atlantis hotel guests. The park is exaggerated and too hyped up. There are huge crowds toward afternoon and evening. The food and water here is over priced and they don't let you take your own water inside, neither does the park have water filter's to quench your thirst if you get thirsty. The water is cold so I would suggest you warm up well after the rides, and take your own towel."

Bring some sandals and sunscreen and a hat. Timing is essential when you go to a certain slide or you could be in line for a while. Best to go during the week so there is less traffic. Get a set of deck chairs and have someone occupy it while you take turns on the slides note: birds may eat you food. Although the water is pleasant in terms of temperature, it gets windy and cold towards the evening to bring something warm.

There is a shuttle bus that takes guests to the Aquaventure park - this runs very consistently. The entrance is inviting. Coffee shops, restaurants, cafe's and other shops along the way. I suggest heading there early as the park does fill up fast. There are however plenty of sunbeds in the different locations around the park. There is also access to the beach for guests. I also suggest pre-purchasing food/lunch upon entry. Food is over priced if purchasing. For entrance to The Lost Chamber and a meal combined - 90 AED. Food and a drink alone for one person can come close to that same amount. Overall, a good day out and a bucket list tick."

The kids splash area is lovely - unfortunately whilst we were there it had to be shut off thrice and restarted - not sure what the problem was.

It's next to the Atlantis hotel and accessed by walking through a mall (typical Dubai style). Once there you book the tickets (be sure to check for any promotions before you book tickets, as they always have something online). The park is huge and long and crazy. Lots of sunscreen is required. The highest slides should be priority, especially the one where you shoot out through the glassed in aquarium. When you're tired out it's fun to just float in the river that winds around the park. Beware that even in winter the Dubai sun is still very strong so stay hydrated and take breaks. There are some food stalls in there and they give you lockers but the food is not restaurant level and the lockers are teeny tiny, so pack light and essentials."

Had such good fun here, there is a lazy river that takes you around most of the water park and even has tunnels and lifts that take you and your rubber ring up into a ride, saves queing on foot.Also if you aren't up for queing for rides you can spend all day going around the lazy river which includes torrents and rapids. Laughed so much in these it was a shame we didn't have time to look at our photos."

Our kids (4 and 8) loved the Kids Splashers Area and spent hours happily trying out all the slides. Though its peak season and it was long weekend holiday (hence very busy time), we only had one 15 min queue at Shark Attack ride and got to do all the rides at least twice without waiting. Shark Attack with the tube going through the aquarium is good fun as is the Surge and Plunge. The rapids are great even with the little ones. There are sufficient child safe tubes, there are lots of lifeguards around, very clean washrooms, the food outlets serve yummy fare, lots of places to sit with loungers and with the park spread wide, you never have the feeling that it's overcrowded even on very busy days. Also it's very nicely shaded with natural foliage and umbrellas so you can relax and sit back before heading off to more fun. Overall, it's a great outing for everyone for the whole day!"

With being HB the entrance fee is included. The day was cloudy with no sun but still quite warm. Towels are free to use. There is a charge for the lockers and don't make the mistake like we did... We grabbed our towels and found a couple of loungers then looked for a locker.... These are at the entrance of the park and it is a 5minute walk from the main area. (So grab your locker at the entrance) There is a zip line that is payable at the entrance too. (75AED if paid at the entrance or 100AED if paid at the zip line) the zip line is unlimited but we only used it once which was a little waste. There are plenty of rubber rings to use but with the weather as it was I guess it would be busier if the sun was out. I was also told to avoid Friday and Saturday as they are the busiest days. The lazy river and Rapids takes a while which is good and there are a few different ways to go round that soak up some time. We didn't hardly queue for any of the rides at all. All very clean but the concrete floor can be very slippery if bare footed so be careful. I noticed a few snack bars for food and drinks but didn't use these. All the lifeguards are pretty friendly and there are plenty of them. I haven't given it 5 star as I missed out on a couple of rides as I don't see them due to poor sign posts and I think lockers more central in the park would also be better than having the long walk to the entrance every time. Other than that worth a visit."

Tower of Poseidon has a many rides but requires a walk up quite a few flight of stairs. I would suggest coming at opening with internet purchased tickets.

Park offers plenty and line ups for the larger rides were minimal at the time we arrived however by approx 1.30 we had approx half hour wait for each ride. To avoid this there are plenty of rapids and pools to just chill out in. Private beach at the palm at the back of the park was great and a little escape from the crowded areas.

The queue looks unnecessarily long with people carrying large tubes in their hands, moreover it is extremely inconceivable. Shame on the management. You spend AED 275 (INR 5,000) for just 8-10 rides.

You can easily spend a whole day in the park with lots of space to sunbathe or sit in the shade to just relax.The rides themselves are some of the best I've been on at a water park. The lazy river is the main feature of the park with lots of rings floating around so no fights needed! The lazy river has direct access to some of the rides so you just float around in your ring and a conveyer belt takes you up to the start point. This lazy river also has 2 sections, Rapids and Torrent. Torrent gives you a bit of a tidal wave at first, but gently pushes you around after that. Rapids are obviously a bit faster, but nothing to worry about and children seemed to be loving it!There are other rides (I think 6 in total) that require you to get out of your ring and carry it up to the entrance. These are definitely worth doing with the highlight being a journey through a shark tank. All in all, a good day out and it's located on the Palm so worth a trip out."

Try this mode of transport its awesumm. Although there lost chanbers aquarium is not worth visiting it has just 8-10 aquarium. Plzzzzz carry your swim suits with u. They charge hefty price for the same. Only towels available for rent not swiming clothes. Best is to carry lycra not cotton shorts and lycra t shirt. Lockers are available to keep valuables. Its a huge place so go in the mrng itself. And in the evng there is a huge queue for cabs. So the best way is go back frm monorail and get down where monorail ends and then u can take a cab from dere. No queue dere or else take the same route u came from in the mrng. First monorail den tram den metro."

Just a suggestion, if you get a raft with two seats keep it with you for the entire time, it is difficult to get one. It was a fun day and my daughter did not want to leave."

We then had some lunch at the shark bites restaurant and walked along the beach. After lunch we went back on another few rides but there were lengthy queues. The only down point is that we came back to our sun loungers after lunch to find that a family had decided to lie all over our beds on top of our towels and they were also lying on another couples bed to the other side. It wasn't until we told them to move and take their own stuff off our beds that they moved. The woman then sat back down, we decided to move beds completely after this and so did the other couple. We only left some clothes but make sure you don't leave any valuables just incase anything gets stolen. This didn't ruin our amazing day but just something to be aware of!"

Once you enter the water in the pond and ride inflated tube-one hole or pair of holes, you loose the track of TIME. seriously !One must try, \"rapids\", here, if not already had a chance to experience. It is at the extension of \"Lazy River\". The depth is about 4 ft. only, therefore, in case, one gets dragged to the wrong direction, or the tube moving too slowly,one can jump down into the pool, push and can even ride the tube, again. Among various slides sitting in the inflated tube, i personally likes \" Shyamal\" the most, as they transport you at an elevation, sitting in the tube, by a conveyor and need not climb up 4-5 floors, high towers !

We also loved the experience on the Zipline but 2 out of the three got a bit stuck on the line because of the wind situation. Tough the Zipline sounds a bit scary because of the nature it was not one bit scary. It was rather pleasant than trilling. The rides were more exciting. There are four Zipline that takes you in 4 different heights. We only took 2 just to have enough time for other slides before the park closed for the day at 5:30Finding individual or double tube for the first set of rides were troublesome. It would have been so much better if the tubes were arranged to be collected at the ride entrance like on the Aquaconda\\zoomarang. Carrying tubes up & down a crowded stairs case was not the ideal arrangementIn this pleasant weather it's a fun way to spend some time with family & friends. If you are from a place where you don't have exciting water parks then this is a must do.Taking some googles will help in some of the body slides Hope you enjoy your day at aquaventure"

We spent a day at the water park and it was great fun - I'm not really into water parks as I'm petrified of rides, but there is something for everyone here and my boyfriend enjoyed the scarier slides and rides whilst I relaxed on the lovely beach which has amazing views of Dubai. Whilst we were there we booked to do the \"shark safari\" which was an amazing experience and the staff that were on the experience with us were very professional but friendly and fun too. There were a couple of tiny gripes that I had though; I think it's really unnecessary to charge for lockers when there's quite a high entrance price anyway, this is something I feel should be included, or should at least be a very small cost. I think 40aed per locker is excessive!! Also the toilets/changing rooms after a couple of hours of being there were disgusting, the smell was awful. there was a cleaner in there every time I went in but they were still horrible so I'm not quite sure what she was doing - maybe she was just there for decoration. I understand it's a busy place but for an establishment of that standard I don't think they were acceptable really. Other than that we had a great day :)"

There were long queues for every ride with everyone pushing and shoving to get ahead. By contrast the aquarium was great with very impressive displays of marine life - well worth a visit. We retreated to Gordon Ramsey's new restaurant - Bread Street inside the Atlantis and had a lovely relaxing lunch and a few cocktails. Much preferred to the melee outside.

A tip- it says no food and drink allowed on the website when booking but at the ticket entrance/ bag check it states 1 x 500ml bottle is acceptable. The rides were great and there are some quieter pool areas and the beach if you want to escape the noise. It goes without saying that it is busy at Aquaventure ( we went on a Monday) but I imagine it's even more so at weekends so get there early! Also queues for the taxis are long and we left at 4.15pm so worth bearing in mind if you want to stay until closing time- you could be waiting a while. Fun day out"

I visited these two restaurants and i highly recommend Barracuda as they had vast variety of choices to make in comparison to Shark Bite.All the rides at Aquaventure were able to fulfil my desires specially the leap of faith and poseidon's revenge.Try your best to go during weekdays and go early as possible to avoid queues and disappointments. When you are returning there will be a huge line waiting for taxis, my recommendation is take the mono rail from water park to the gateway from there take the tramp to atlantis and from that point you can go in the metro for your final destination.

It has something for everyone, whether you just want to lie in the sun by the pool or beach, go on some scary water slides or just relax on the lazy river. A variety of food and drink available, some may be pricey, depending on what you want, but plenty of choice. I think it's something everyone should do on a visit to Dubai, you won't be disappointed. It's such a fun day. A great way to see Atlantis too and get some lovely photos of the amazing views around you."

            "review": "A great waterpark - plenty of adrenaline-filled rides but equal measures of lazy-river calm. Located between the Atlantis and the Sofitel on the outer crescent of the Palm, Aquaventure Waterpark is a must-visit attraction in Dubai. There's such a great collection of slides and water-based rides that it is definitely worth getting here early to get the longest amount of time possible in the park.From the entrance to the Atlantis right next to the monorail station it's just a short walk through a shopping precinct to get to the Aquaventure ticket area. The rates for pre-booked tickets online are slightly cheaper than on-the-day (AED250/275 respectively). It's well worth going for the ticket with an inclusive meal deal - at AED295 it's only a small premium to pay, and the food itself was surprisingly good for what we thought would just be very naff fast food. In actual fact, the chicken shawarmas we had were excellent. The included drink is also something you'd definitely find yourself buying if it wasn't already included as you work up a real thirst outside in the heat walking between attractions.The backbone of the whole waterpark is the lazy river, where you can float around literally all day on either a single or double inflatable ring. For a lot of older people visiting the park with younger family it would be a great way to enjoy the park without going on any of the proper thrill rides, and even on the lazy river there are some really fun rapids sections.Most of the bigger rides are ridden on the same inflatables from the lazy river, which does mean carrying them around the park and up more than a few flights of stairs for most rides. They're not too heavy but would be fairly strenuous for smaller children. There are two main towers within the park from which a number of rides start. The one closest to the front of the park (Neptune's Tower) is the starting point for around 5 different slides/rides. The Leap of Faith is the only traditional slide which you ride without an inflatable - this is a fairly intense drop from the very top of the structure, straight down a near vertical slide, and into a pool at the end. Once you've gone down the sheer drop you zoom through the middle of an aquarium tank filled with sharks and rays, but even trying to keep your eyes open to take this in the slide is so fast it's impossible.All of the other rides from this tower need inflatables. The water coasters are all similar but different enough to make each one memorable. The Shark Attack ride has a section where you are floating inside a glass tunnel inside a giant aquarium - from here you can enjoy watching the marine life as you float by.There is a water coaster which starts a short distance from this first tower called Shamal which is pretty spectacular - instead of going up on a lift you are pushed uphill by the power of water alone. You get absolutely soaked but again, all part of the fun.The second tower (Tower of Poseidon) is right at the back of the waterpark. There are four main different rides starting at the top of this tower. You don't need to take an inflatable ring for any of these rides. The first two water rides here are raft based and can seat up to 6-7 people. The better of the two rides by a long way is Zoomerango. It starts off fairly sedately but has an incredible steep drop that really does give you that dropping feeling. There's a similar raft based ride called Aquaconda which doesn't have as big a drop but is still great fun.There are two side-by-side water flumes which have timers on so you can race whoever is next to you - these seemed to be a bit hit and miss with the people I was with; some people would fly down them and others would be struggling not to grind to a halt midway down. I didn't have the time or inclination to go on Poseidon's Revenge, but it did look great. It starts near vertical with the rider stood in a chamber which has a trap door at the bottom - once the chamber is sealed this drops away and the rider flies down into the slide below.All in all, a really spectacular day out in a very well run resort environment. As mentioned at the start of the review, definitely go for the meal deal ticket which is great value for money. If you're staying at a hotel then I'd suggest bringing towels from there if you don't want to pay to rent one for the day. A small locker (which would still take most daypacks) was AED40 to rent for the day. The admission isn't exactly cheap but for an entire day out with nothing else to pay, it really is great fun with some brilliant rides."

We spend the morning doing the rides and the afternoon on the beach. Overall I think it was decent value given the choice and standard of the whole place. You are in Dubai so there are certain times when you pay more than you'd like for things like ice-cream but hey-ho, given the overall location and its quality it still feels worth it somehow. Travel-wise, we took a taxi there (from a hotel near Mall of the Emirates) and we paid 50AED there and 40AED to come back. Don't hesitate in trying this place out, the backdrop of the hotel is almost worth the admission fee."

You can stay and relax by the pool or by the beach. The beach area near Baracuda restaurant is nicer, with palm trees and some grass, so you can stay on the shade. They don't have beach umbrellas unless you have arrangement with the hotel. Yes, it is part of the Atlantis Hotel. The only thing that disappointed us was the quality and price of the foods. We had lunch at the Shark Bite restaurant. The package of the burger, fries, drink and small fruit salad cost 90 aed. And the fried chicken for 3 people cost 140 aed. We know that it's usually like this if you dine inside the hotel, but at least we should get the quality equals to the price. Here, the chicken was dried, it was like it has been prepared and cooked from yesterday. KFC is way much better, I would say. Overall, we had fun with all the rides that they have."

The second surprise was the locker, you can bay it for UAE dirhams only. If you don't have any id, you can't change the many. But any way you don't need this locker at all, you can take your things with you to the area, there are enough sun lounger you could put it on. The rest time was great! I love the river around all the aquapark, you can just swimm in a rubber ring arround all the territory all the day :) In any case, if you sited dawn in this rubber ring you don't need to stand up, there some ways, wich take you everywhere to all the slides! You need the money wit you too. Drinks and food you can bay there to pay it right now only. And you can take your towel with you, if you don't want to pay for the towel rent. There is beach too, if you'd like, you can enjoy the sea and sand. And we didn't notice some raw to the slice. It was to the \"shark attak\" slice only, but it took 10 minutes only. For the children it great! For the adults too :))"

We are a family of five (father, mother, three children aged 8, 5, 5) and unfortunately this one really ruined our day. We had booked our tickets online and had paid AED 1300 (USD 350) for them (for a five tickets, two adults and three kids). A little pricy, but we were looking forward to it. The first negative surprise was was at the entrance, where there was an entire list of stuff that we needed to pay extra for. Towels (USD 40 ... just for the day's rental), Plastic cups to get drinks (USD 40, only the first drink is free!), and a large locker (USD 20). We were now at USD 450, and that still did not include lunch! When we got to the locker areas, we saw that the lockers were either in the men's or in the ladies' areas. This meant that we could not really share our family locker and had to run in and out until we had all undressed and gotten our things stowed. Shortly after that, we discovered that all six main slides were only for people taller than 1.2 meters. This excluded our two 5 year olds. Nobody had told us this, neither when we bought the tickets, nor when we picked them up. When we brought this up with a manager, he mentioned that it was part of the terms and conditions and that everyone needs to read all terms and conditions before buying something. I thought of iTunes and didn't say anything ... naturally, one of the grownups had to stay with the little ones, which means that only 2/5 of us paying guests got to enjoy the main attractions after paying $450 for the day. We then went to get our $40 towels, only to discover that they weren't really useful since one cannot take them on any rides. We had to leave them when we got onto the \"lazy river\" ride and of course, they were not there when we came back. Apart from this, it was extremely crowded with guests ... and with lifeguards every 5 meters who educated us on all the things that we were not allowed to do. Some attendants were also taking pictures. These were for sale at the exit for $30 (in print) or $135 (in electronic format). For some reason, they also manage to keep the locker information on the arm-band (on a bar code), but are not able to do this for the lunch or towel vouchers. This meant that we had to run back when we needed to eat and when we needed to get towels. So, there you have it. Our worst experience in Dubai. We had been to Wild Wadi Waterpark - Jumeirah before and should have gone there again! Ah ... the food is junk food at best"

My husband went on Poseidon's Tower (a massive drop slide), and there are lots of other pools and rides - depending on how daring you are. There are changing rooms and toilets available as well as plenty of sun beds and places to get food / drinks. It was super clean and the staff were very helpful.

My daughter is under 1.2m so her ticket cost less, and my younger daughter was free as she is under 2 years old.We used to City Sightseeing open top bus to travel to Atlantis/Aquaventure, which was great. There are plenty of attractions here for all ages, and wait times were ok. We ate lunch at Shark Bites, which wasn't actually as expensive as we expected.

You can either head towards the rapids, the slides or the torrent and you'll never be bored because it's so relaxing in the tubes.My only issues were that the smokers section seems to be right at the entrance to the park so you are forced to breathe in a whole lot of second hand smoke as you enter and exit the park which is pretty gross for a non smoker.Also, if lockers were spread out amongst the park it would make navigation a lot easier. The only locker location is at the bathrooms/washrooms at the entrance to the park and is very crowded due to people waiting for their family members outside the locker rooms, once again also right next to a cloud of second hand smoke. Massive kudos to the photographers who took some great photos and the bands are a great idea for find our photos later on.A good day out but not sure if I'd do it again."

And if you get hungry they have all kin of food in a \"restaurant\" near by. The funniest part is that when we entered the slide we exit somewhere else and the we thought, damn, now we have to walk barefoot all the way back to the enter point but no. That was not any issue when we saw the buggies, they drive you wherever you want inside the waterpark for free. Of course you pay for the ticket but still it was free.

I was a bit surprised we had to queue to collect wristbands even though I'd pre booked tickets, this queue took at least 45 minutes which was unfortunate and a boring wait for our young kids. Once we collected our wrist bands we had our bag searched (didn't find my secret stash of kids snacks) and made our way in. Collected the kids life jackets from the towel cabana and attempted to find a couple of sunbeds. It was very busy and most sunbeds were taken. We eventually found 2 beds in the back row opposite the kids splash park. We loved the lazy river although I wouldn't call it lazy as it has a large section with waves that push you down and has little side sections you can go down with rapids. We loved it though and thought it was great fun. We went on shark attack which looked quite tame with a little float through a tunnel in the aquarium. The start however is fast and pitch black but great fun.Our son loved the kids splasha park which has numerous slides, buckets and sprays throwing water over you and sprayers you can control yourself. We didn't have the opportunity to go on anything else with the little kids but still had a great day. We had lunch there, 4 meals with chips and 4 drinks which was 220 aed and was reasonable. The park closed at 5.30 as it got dark then. The taxi queue to leave was awful so we decided to get the monorail which was a big mistake as had a 20 minute wait for the next one and then no taxis at the end of the line so in future would leave just before closing to avoid long taxi queue.Quite expensive for the day if you are taking young kids as you are limited to what you are able to go on but a fun day out regardless."

There was also a chance to go around the whole of the park in a rubber ring, and to make it more interesting you also encountered the odd rapid adventure on your way round. A ride that lasted about 1/2 hour. Brilliant place."

It's very expensive unless you've staying at Atlantis, but Atlantis is pretty hideous so I suggest you stay someone else and put up with the cost. If it's the school holidays get here before it opens to avoid having to queue, then when it gets busy you can find ourself a sun lounger. Best thing about it is probably the Flor ice cream. Flor is one of the best gelato shops in Rome and whaddya know - they have it here too. Hardly anyone was eating it when we were there. Try the yoghurt flavour - it's heaven in a cone."

The park is large and takes approx 40-50 mins to do a circuit in the lazy river. There are lots of places to relax and then get into a lagoon to start the Rapids. There is with all these places a large queue to get onto the other rides but you are always moving. The restaurants are nice and the food quality especially for a child's meal is good, they all seem to come with fruit as well.The only gripe I had about the water park was on leaving, there were precious few taxi's outside and a large queue. We were staying in the palm and decided to start walking and flag down a taxi, this was a lot cheaper than the hotel cars at a minimum of 90Dhrs even for a 2 mile ride. I worked out that if staying on the palm then it would still be quicker and cheaper to get the mo oral back to Jumeriah and then get a taxi back to the hotel."

You can also buy or rent these here.- there's an option to put money on to your wristband and use this to pay for everything while you're inside. Very handy because no wet money.

My other half loved the slides they had there and the rapids were great fun.There is also a beach you can chill out on.You have to buy a locker there if you want to store anything and this is done on a wristband which you swipe to get in and out of your locker. They werent cheap though and im sure you dont get the money back from the locker as you pay to rent them. You can also put money on a wristband to buy drinks/food etc with and this is a good idea so you dont need to carry money around with you. Any money left on the band you can go and get this refunded back to you.The only thing that was annoying about this place was getting a taxi after you left, the queue was like an hour long. We tried getting a taxi further up the road by the Atlantis but that didnt work as they wouldnt stop on the road. In the end we hired a private car which wasnt to much money but saved waiting for ages for a taxi."

Cost is 310 dirhams (\u00a354 approx) for adults and 265 dirhams (\u00a346 approx) for children so not exactly cheap!!2. Majority of the water rides have a minimum height restriction of 1.2m.3. Rather than taking in cash you can top up your wrist band at the ticket booths with money and use it in the park. Any money left on the wristband is refunded at the end of the day. Saves you getting your dirhams wet!!4. Buy a waterproof phone pouch. Cost approx 120 dirhams (\u00a321) but allows you to take your phone with you into the water rides and take pictures etc. definitely worth getting.5. A locker will cost you 40 dirhams. One locker enough for two people. Anything more than that and you will need another locker.6. Towels are charged at 30 dirhams so just take your own and keep it on one of the sunbeds around the park.7. The ground gets RED HOT so take your flip flops with you or you will be hot footing around the park when you're out of the water which isn't good.8. Don't bother with the 'taste the fun' meal deal ticket. It saves you 25dirhams but you're restricted where you can eat (barracudas and shark bites) and they have massive queues for lunch. Just eat at the food booths around the park and use your topped up wrist band to pay.9. Get there early and you can save queuing on the rides. I didn't really queue on anything, however it was a Wednesday. 10. Avoid going on a Friday or Saturday, I have heard it is very busy because it's the weekend in Dubai.11. When it's time to leave you will queue over an hour for a taxi. Very frustrating when you've had a long day. This is for two reasons. The city taxis change shifts between 4pm and 6pm so it is difficult to get a taxi anyway and second reason is everyone leaves at the same time. Best advise for transport is either try and leave before 3.30pm or just book a private taxi in advance and arrange a pick up time (that's what I did and my car was waiting for me). Cost me a little extra but definitely worth it when I saw the taxi queue at 5.30pm!!10. There is also a beach there too so worth checking out.Any questions let me know.Enjoy your day"

The machine was down so it took them about 20 mins to load up. Food is pretty expensive and not the best quality. But there is a wide selection of fast food outlets insideThis is by far the best waterpark in this area. The rides are well manned. As expected queues form at the popular rides. I personally just loved sitting in the float with my son floating around to wherever the river takes us. The floor is pretty hot in summer so you may want to take your flip flops with you but then you have the hassle of picking them up after the rides.If you have to buy tickets to this place; towels and lockers are separately charged so quite expensiveIt closes quite early at 6pm ( sunset) and you can take a buggy back to the entranceAll in all a fun day out"

The water aspects of the park are mostly great - staff, were really welcoming and helpful.The huge caveat - 1) dining facilities are really weak, 2) the exit - whether via taxi or monorail is ridiculous - there's no efficient alternative (perhaps driving is ok?) - it's either wait in line for 60 minutes or pay triple the taxi fare or take an expensive, inefficient monorail, 3) and the co-location with Atlantis is absolutely orchestrated to make anyone not staying at the resort feel second-rate. To use a mass market comparison - if you go to Disney, you generally feel great (or at least not like pond-scum), regardless of whether you stay at the Swan and Dolphin, at least they don't go out of their way to make the day visitors feel like they are not wanted. Regrettably, this facility seems deliberately set up to make non-resort guests feel unwelcome. Weird and ultimately not good business.Atlantis, and their property Aquaventure, absolutely miss the mark hereNot sure that there's a better water park alternative, but set your expectations accordingly. If you're at the hotel, you're probably great, if not, be prepared to be meat."

We were staying at the Atlantis hotel so got in a few minutes before the general public.Busy after 13:00 to the point where it isn't fun anymore.Some parts of the lazy river were closed for a large part of our 10 day stay. A couple of the premiere water rides were not working too.There were some irritating things like no Yoghurt was delivered for most of the week, so smoothies were a bit odd.Smoking is permitted in the park, but only near the obvious waste bins. SomeGuests ignored this, but staff were happy to politely remind them of the rules.If you don't have a bed by 11:00, you have a search on your hands.Some reserved areas are available for 800AED per day. They can be booked in advance, which gets round the whole issue.The park is divided into three main let's. A lazy river, which isn't very lazy with plenty of rapids. A circuit is about 40 minutes.There is the tower of Neptune and Tower of Poseidon. The \"leap of faith\" is the most vertical ride and opens when the park does and is in Neptune. Poseidon has some big group rides, but opens at 11:00.There is a zip line that has three sections and buying a ticket for 75AED, means you can ride as many times as you like.We didn't eat in the park, but there are plenty of snack food places to choose from.There are lockers when you enter the park, but the consensus was they were expensive and neither we nor anyone weMet had had a problem and provided you take sensible precautions, it would probably be OK.Don't forget toKeep electronic gear out of the direct sunlight, as they will fry."

Firstly they offer a free entry if it's your birthday week. Worth knowing and search their website to see how to get the voucher. They then need you to print the voucher which is often pretty hard to do on holiday. The ticket office pointed us to the hotel business centre which was a 15 minute walk away in the Atlantis hotel. We enjoyed seeing the hotel but this was very frustrating as most places will accept a view of the email on screen? We then bough a meal deal which needed us to take the paper recipe to be able to redeem even though it was noted on our wristbands. Paper receipts don't work well in a water park!!The rides were excellent and pretty well organised. The queues at the furthest away rides were less and moved faster as they had larger capacities!Finally being at the end of the Palm Jumeirah, there is not a greta deal of passing trade for taxis so we had an hour wait at the end of the day. Organised buses to the nearest metro or other convenient location would have been great."

I went back to the counter to talk about it. Which utilized so much of my time. Though inside overall experience was good. But your staff in the zipline were often rude when I didnt know what to do when they were fixing the rope harness around me, one was Indian and other was I think from Phillipines or Nepal. I admit it was my first time on the zipline too, but they should be humble enough too. But I wont deduct this point from the water park as this is issue with the staff. Kindly proper train them on how to behave with the visitors. Food was OK. But too less for the price of 45 AED.And the gift shop items are too expensive...Overall the experience was good, will come back again.

For families there are big adventure play areas, lazy rivers and tame slides, but for those who like adrenaline rushes you also have the Leap of Faith which is a 60 ft near vertical slide taking you straight through the shark tank, or the new Poseidon's revenge where the floor drops from under you to send you shooting through the shute! There are also additional actvities you can chose to do as well, such as walking on the floor of the shark tank (this is at an additional charge) or even just relaxing on the private beach that's also attached to the park. We managed to just about do every ride in a 7 hour stay. A couple of tips- the floor is extremely hot, so keep your flip flops on while walking round the park- they let you carry them on the rides so you don't blister your feet like we did! Oops! Also due to the heat they will allow you to bring up to a litre of water per person into the park- i highly recommend doing this as even though refreshments are readily available, it will save you a bit of money!"

The bigger slides are good fun and the set up of the whole place is amazing, you can just walk around the place and be amazed. The best thing is just how safe everything is, we placed our belongings on the beach and sun bathed, then decided to walk around the entire place for hours and came to back to find our bags perfectly fine. Apparently this is normal which is a pleasant surprise."

This water park is great fun for anyone who loves an adrenalin rush, as well as for those of us who prefer the more quiet \"lazy rivers\". The park has an intricate weave of rivers that range from quiet to class 3 rafts. Lots of fun, and lifeguards every 50 meters minimum. The beach is beautiful, as well as the entire water park. It is very well maintained.We also did the zipline which is new this year I believe. It's 100 dirhams, with unlimited number of rides, so it might be worth doing this as one of the first things, and the revisit later in the day."

            "review": "Worth a visit if you've got the money & time spare. My boyfriend & I (mid 20's) visited Atlantis Water Park for my birthday in July. Pro's: Huge area with so many different rides (most are for the thrill-seeker!). During off-peak season there was hardly anyone there so we could jump straight on any rides we wanted. Be warned there are LOTS of stairs to get to any of the rides. We used Uber to get there & right throughout our trip which saved us a lot of money. Great electronic locker system in the toilets to store your items in while you're in the park. Loved the crushed ice cones to stay cool, & they had a stall selling some kind of meat & cheese wraps which were amazing. Cons: Firstly, look up costs as the entire place is expensive to get in. We didn't get there till 4pm & the price was the same as being there all day, they closed at 7pm. We went in July so it was extremely hot & unfortunately all the pools were hotter than air temperature which wasn't very refreshing. I had cotton shorts that I wear as board-shorts & was not permitted in the pool as they were not allowed - it was my birthday & I was worried I wouldn't be able to buy board shorts my size so this was extremely upsetting & I cried quite a lot but thankfully found some board shorts that fit from one of the stores. countless flights of stairs to any of the rides, also have to carry up tubes for a lot of them. (good way to tire the kids out I guess) Wear shoes around as ground can get very hot. Summary: Worth it if you've got a large part of a day to spend & money isn't much of an issue, Would recommend if you have kids 8-18 as they would get the most out of the rides. I personally wouldn't go here again unless I was staying at the Atlantis Hotel but it was still good to have seen."

During my last visit in January 2013 I missed an opportunity to visit this hotel and park due to less number of days in Dubai. This time I went for 7 nights and chose aquaventure park on my last day in Dubai as i wanted to have the memories last longer. I have been to many waterparks across the globe but found this one as the best waterparks till now. 1. Rapids in the pool will make you feel adventurous and full of thrill. 2. Leap of faith slide will take you to next level. The one you cannot forget your life. 3. Other water slides are scary as they are in dark and ends inside the aquarium but are fun.4. Small slides made for children but elders also enjoy these a lot due to new style and it let's you to be with your children.5. Atlantis beach. You get your access to Atlantis beach which is out of this world. This beach is connected with Burj al Arab beach and gives you a great and beautiful view. No beach can stand its beauty.6. Dolphin bay 7. Multiple food outlets. To conclude I would recommend every person to visit Dubai just for this waterpark. You will feel awesome and you will be speachless after your visit.Few suggestions for the management:1. Slippers should be provided inside the waterpark for all visitors. People not carrying their slippers feels very uncomfortable due to immense heat on the floor with bare foot and even scratches your visit. If cannot provide then it should be strictly mentioned in the vouchers to carry your own slippers. The cost is very high for a general slipper inside the waterpark which was around 169 aed (minimum) which is around 3000 rupees. These slippers would cost no more than 10 aed in general market. 2. Complimentary Towel should be given to every customer visiting the waterpark as I don't understand the reason to charge 30 aed extra for a single towel. The ticket is already 315 aed which should include general stuff. 3. Complimentary access to lockers. Currently, 40 aed is being charged for a locker which is very small. I could not even fit a normal backpack inside the locker easily. That's just not fair from the managements point of view.If these actions are taken and considered then I assure you that this water park would be the bestest park and would enter its name in book of records not just because of its rides and slides also because of its service. One should not forget that tourism is dependent on customers and customers are not dependent on tourism."

It also allowed us to arrange our entrance wristbands in the hotel, which was good, as the entry to the park was very busy, with long queues. The staff were also not very helpful as we entered, as no-one mentioned we needed to pay for a locker at the entrance, so I had to go back to get a wristband for that.Once inside the park we found it to be spacious and well laid out in the way it cleverly spread people out, although this was outside the main holiday period and the larger rides look set up for handling big queues, so I reckon it could be much more congested in the busiest parts of the holiday season. The rides themselves were all very good and my 7 year old loved the whole experience and as he was over 1.2m tall, he could go in every one. A problem came on the lazy river / rapids however, as unused rings carry on down the ride and when they get to narrow points, they cluster together and block any movement. This means that riders have to get off their rings to clear the blockages, while the lifeguards watch from the side (often laughing at the congestion). If the lifeguards are not allowed to enter the water for routine matters then the park should provide marshals who can help keep things moving. The children's play area was also great fun and suitable for kids from very young ages up to pre-teen. Just a word of warning too. There is plenty of shade around the park, but the lazy river and many of the queues are out in the sun, so you can be exposed for extended periods. Make sure you use lots of sunscreen and have footwear and a hat to protect yourself (I tucked my flip flops and hat into the back of my shorts or UV shirt on rides and held onto my sunglasses which worked fine).We had a great couple of days in the park and had no major complaints and I would recommend this attraction as exhausting fun for families looking for a full day out in Dubai. We all slept very well after visiting."

On entry into the water park you get a wristband (for everything), we opted to take the pre paid wristband so we didn't have to mess about with cash or anything. We used the money in the wristband, but we had to go back to the entrance to top up the band, which is a nightmare as your already in the park!! When i asked to top up i was told that we cant top up, we have to have another wristband? I already had an entrance, locker, and prepaid wristband on, so i now have four wristband on....nightmare. On entry we opted for the towel hire too which is great, but your towel hire receipt is a paper till receipt, and when you but this you are advised that if you loose the reciept you cant exchange your towels?? We opted for the meal deal, great value for money a definite must. We purchased the meal deal were you have a variety of restaurants to use. We ate at the \"sharks bay\" restaurant and was just perfect. We had the burger and chips deal and it was huge.The staff in the restaurant were very polite, professional and very very helpful. Nothing was a problem it was a pleasure to be served by efficient and professional staff..excellent service in the restaurants well done :-) The water park itself, is immaculate.

The lazy river runs around most of the park and from it you can access lots of the water slides something we thought was great, you don't even have to get out of your rubber ring! We had great fun exploring and trying out the various slides, particularly the one that goes through the aquarium, it's a very surreal experience! We were unsure about the leap of faith but eventually threw ourselves down, it's nowhere near as scary as it looks, my advice is just go for it or you'll regret it later! You also have access to a beautiful beach which is great if you fancy some relaxation after all that sliding.Plenty of choice regarding food and drinks however like I said it is quite expensive.The park do not permit food or drink to be bought in however they will allow a litre bottle of water per person so this is a good way to keep drink costs down in the heat!

We arrived around 9am and were able to ride every single ride (sometimes twice) and no line up was more than 10 mins.A bit expensive in the scheme of things, but considering you are in Dubai, and get to spend the entire day there, alright, fine. Food at the stands was generally what you would find at any amusement park, but expect it.The strange thing, though, is that if you get a locker it is only in the dressing room, so if you are with people who ALL want to swin, or go on rides but need your phone or some money with you, you might feel strange just leaving it at your seat. Course Dubai is quite safe, you never know- right.The rides are all excellent, and the lazy river was nice, and uhm, lazy. Oh and Poseidon's Revenge is amazing, and scary, but just keep telling yourself it is only 7 seconds long.Thumbs up all around."

They make you pay for everything and seen the amount of money you have already paid, you tell yourself, okay some more won't ruin you but you end up ruined!The only thing Aquaventure has more than wild wadi is that artificial beach. Being Tunisian grown near the sea, I know what a real beach looks like and was very disappointed by the almost still water and those \"construction site souvenirs\" ( those small grey cement stones that you can find if you trouble over some sand).One positive thing is the availability of metro and of small golf cars to take wherever you need, you don't have to worry about transportation.For photographers like me, you can take your gear and take as much photos as you want, staff is friendly."

This water park is brilliant, it's my first visit to a proper one and it didn't disappoint.There is so much variety in the slides, you can spend an hour or so in your tube and still do multiple different slides without even getting up.The weather is almost guaranteed as it's Dubai, and it's so nice to spend the day in the sunshine and just having a nice dip in the cool water to chill out.There are some points to consider as they aren't too clear at the start...The cashless wristbands have to be pre loaded from the start, not just pay at the end. Understandable as it would be impossible to police after payment under the current setup.Don't store your flip flops in your locker, take them with you. The floor is very hot. Maybe obvious but had an unnecessary paranoia about them getting stolen but it's very safe there.If you manage to get a view of the sharks in the tank on the Leap of Faith then I'd be very impressed!

They also do like meal day offers etc. (295 AED for entry with lunch)..Tip: Take towels and try and leave valuables at the your hotel... This way it saves you about 50 AED for 1 towel hire and 1 locker... Cash you can charge to a wristband so you don't have to leave it in a bag at your lounger! You then get a refund of any money you aint spent at the end off your band - great idea! (i used it when i needed water etc. and didn't want to treck to my lounger from the other side of the park!

And they made rides as safe as a hamster. But the food is a tad expensive but tasty. Also most of the rides are a bit too scary for younger children but they do have this sorted because they have a super fun childrens play area. I recommend the lagoon ride as a fun and relaxing way to travel around the park. I also recommend the shark attack ride as you go through a tube in a tank full of fish ,stingrays ,and sharks. Also the rides in the Poseidon tower were scary for young children so I don't recommend it for family visits. But you should bring sunscreen, quick slip on shoes, a hat and a towel. Note don't bring food if they find any they will throw it out. Lastly it takes about 1\u20e3 day to do most of the rides. Over all In my opinion this is the best water park in the universe\u2757\ufe0f Written by Harry our 9 year old."

It was a bit expensive because you almost have to rent a locker (we split the rental between two people to save cost, and that worked well), and you can't bring food or water in so you have to buy it there. It was worth the cost though if you can stay all day! There is definitely enough to do. After we got tired of going on all the big slides and waiting in lines, we just spent a long time on the lazy river to rest up. There is also access to the beach for relaxing! BRING FLIP FLOPS! The ground gets extremely hot when you don't have any shoes on. On the rides you can just hold them in your hands or leave them at the bottom of the stairs."

The size of the park is my only complaint other than confusion and a lack of park map visuals. Bring money for food and drinks. Also, don't forget to bring sunscreen. Towels are a separate rental purchase fee, but are large enough to accommodate several children. Visitor parking is separated from the park itself and requires a bus shuttle to the entrance of the resort. Overall we had a great time but would only come back if tickets are discounted as I feel that other water parks in the country are much easier to manage for families with small children."

She had the best day, we stayed for 5 hours and still didn't get time to do all the rides. Highly recommend walking across to the beach too, the sand is crazy soft and the sea is as warm as the bath. It's an experience in itself. Also if you lay still in the sea for a couple of minutes you will be surrounded by lots of fish. Well worth doing. The slides are great for all varieties of thrill seekers, some are very big, fast and scary.. Others are the opposite! This was my favourite Dubai excursion by far. Highly recommend!"

My top tip here is to arrive early, and go midweek - very few queues to maximise your stay. Take your own town, also wear flip-flops in the park - as the floor is scorching!! Just try to remember where you left them!! Opt for the no-cash option with the cashless wrist tags. And constantly top up on the sunscreen - it's hot out there!"

There should have been a maximum capacity. The place was so packed with people swimming in their clothes, abayas, shoes, you name it. The park pools were filthy dirty. I highly suggest management add additional showers with rules for people to shower before entering the waters.The staff were so overwhelmed that they couldn't provide accurate information to anything really. Entering the locker room was like walking through a mosh pit at a concert being dragged in and out. Muddy floors, baby dippers on the grounds, people climbing on each other to get to a locker or a sink. In short, the park has some great rides. But never ever visit on a weekend or public holiday.

The facilities are better than standard. However, I think it is a bit overpriced. First of all, they charge for almost everything. I was disappointed to find that you have to pay additional money for a locker, towels. These should be amenities that come at no additional cost. Definitely bring a gopro if you are the type with the stomach for the daring rides. Also bring your own towels if you don't want to pay for them. Please don't forget your flip flops we went around noon and you can't walk the ground barefooted, it can get very hot."

Our 3 year old could play at a section dedicated for younger kids with loads of water cannons, and slides and lots of lifeguards. Plenty of spots in shade to relax. The best part was the massive rapids course - you could use double inflatable rings so that our 3 year old could come too by sitting in a special childrens version with a flat bottom seat. The rapids are totally safe, yet designed to give a thrill. Very worthwhile."

The 'rides' have just the right amount of action and relaxation and I spent at least 2 hours just floating. Good places to eat too and I would have gone back the next day if there just weren't so many other things to do in Dubai."

First of all if you are planning to go there as a family of 4 take a taxi it will be about 10 Derhams more on each trip but a lot faster we chose the metro cause I personally believe there is no better way to know about people but getting on their public transport which I was wrong cause metro in Dubai is designed for workers and tourists any way after getting off at station 36 we were told we need to take the tram and get off at jumeirah station which can be a bit tricky cause we missed the stop and had to wait 20 min for the next tram and we were not the only ones after that we had to get on the mono rail and for that you have to leave the tram station walk out about 4 min and there another 20 min wait began so you see taxi is better . If you are on budjet dont forget to bring your towel and a pair of slippers . The floors can get hot.most I mean all of the attractions are around the zigorat so thats where you need to be. In all I think wild wadi was way better than this one but non is as good as Yas water park in Abudhabi.Yas is Bigger , has more rides, way cleaner,the water is cold which is a blessing in that heat, there are Free Free drinking water fountains all around the park but again never forgets your slippers cause the floors are scorching hot ans slippers are 99 Derhams."

Rides are almost similar in both parks but atlantis has other activities too, its huge.i loved Leap of Faith 90 ft high - 5 times i slide from it, scary when you see from top to bottom gives you goosebumps once you are on it ....vrooooom like ferrari.while climbing up for all big slides being wet you can slip its concrete stairs be careful...Other Rides are good too, but not Exceptional.one of the Lazy Ring Ride passes via Glasstube its fun surrounding with fishes and small sharks.kids zone is fun. Food is expensive.Do remember they give you a tag kind of on your hand if you misplace it or washes off in water you need to punch it again from the counter without that you cant open locker. Metro train is available but not directly you have to change 2 times to reach there Must tell you its Wonderful experience going by it passes via Palm Beach Beautiful..you can hire a car or go if you have your own transport.

Or a water ride that ends with you sailing through a huge marine life fish tank... yes the ride goes right though it so you can see all the fish swimming above and around you. Very cool. One issue is that if you go in the busy periods (Winter time) its just too overcrowded. I tried to go at Xmas time and we couldn't even get in the door so we just turned around.

The locker is inside the changing room, so if you are visiting their with your partner you may find a bit annoying.After getting the ticket and other supplementary items, the staff will give u a wrist band with bar code on it. The locker is assigned by scanning the barcode on the band and becareful of choosing X to continue using that if you unlock the locker. Quite a lot of activities in the park, but its mostly water slides. The shark attack one was decent as you will head to the aquarium after the slide. Most of the area is exposed to sun so better get yourself prepared.Quite expensive though still cheaper than wild wadi. Worth a try anyway."

But you need to decide at the time of booking where whether you want it in the men's or women's locker area.Food and drinks are expensive, but you can come out and eat a cheaper just outside to park (in the general mall area).The water park itself is awesome, but make sure you put on sunscreen.Easily spend the whole day here."

It has lifts, rapids, slides, and also just some floating about. Crazy but awesome.Slides - Again a spectacular collection of slides, queueing was relatively short and we went on a Saturday. Great collection of slides for couples to do at the same time.Pools/Beaches/Sunbeds - LOADS of all these, and the resort has a side that backs onto the beach for those who just want to sit there and soak it all in."

Next hit the Rapids and other floaty rides. Towards the end hit the Leap of Faith (wear goggles!). After this you need the final thrill of the zoomerang and annaconda. Go off season, like middle summer. Wear a hat, take slippers, and you will have all the rides in one morning, without any waiting! Start at 10 am, and have fun.Best part is propably you can take your Go-pro or watercamera, and enjoy the screams again at home."

            "review": "Overrated. When you come to Dubai on holiday with the kids the day time theme is usually water parks. We've been to Dubai every year for 11 years now and are always satisfied at Wild Wadi but this year we decided to go to the Atlantis waterpark. The first thing to say is it is ridiculously expensive to get in. 2 adults and 3 kids cost about \u00a3225 just for entry. The irony is that the kids were actually classed as adults and I had to buy adult tickets for 5 people. The queues to get in (and get lockers etc) were very long and the waiting areas outdoor and poorly air conditioned. Lots of people were turning up with vouchers and the staff processing them were fairly incompetent. I queued for 15 minutes for a locker then gave up. A friend of mine had booked one, we shared. They try and sell you big lockers when the small ones are big enough.The next most ridiculous thing at the waterpark is the lack of facility to put money on your wristband. So effectively you have to leave your money in the changing room. So every time you want a drink or food you have to make the long walk back to the locker room to get your notes! A complete waste of time. The rides themselves are plentiful but you have to find and then carry your inflatables up to the ride. The kids found this difficult and then when you get to the ride they're all very short and over before you know it resulting in the need to carry the inflatable back up to the top again. Suggest the investment in the motorised pulleys that take the inflatables up to the start of the rides for customer ease - a clear lack of investment! It's a big water park you can fill your day in it, the kids thought Wild Wadi was way better.The staff were helpful and courteous. The food was reasonably priced for the resort.I have to say we left 1/4 hour before the end and made our way out to the taxi queue. The chap marshalling the queue was timid and had no idea what was going on. People were pushing and shoving and what should have been an orderly queue turned out to be a disorganised crowd which was out of control.Having been there and sampled it that was enough. It was a very hot day, there was limited shelter and everything was so far away. I'm not in a rush to go back. You can have so much more fun at Wild Wadi and for a fraction of the effort!"

Do not have heavy meals, I repeat, do not have heavy meals. Lovely Rides to Amazing relaxing long river which takes you to other rides. I dare you to do the \"Leap of Faith\" and yeah I did it. It's a Lifetime Experience!! No regrets when you leave this place. Dubai boils during summer, so I reckon you do it before summer sets in or after summer. Every Slide gives a new experience. Had alot of fun, made memories. Dubai residents (residence visa) get discounts, so avail the offer. Make sure to look up when you do the leap of faith to click your face clearly and collect the photos before leaving. Its dam worth the price of the photo for a memory although its a bit expensive.

We were staying in the Atlantis so the park and towel rental was included which was is a lovely bonus. I have really bad asthma so walking up loads of stairs to get to rides in other parks is a problem for me, so the best part for me about aquaventure is that the lazy river/Rapids can take you right up to other rides without even leaving the water/your tube. Yes there are some rides that this is available for and you do have to climb a lot of stairs for but this was a great help. Staff are so helpful and were great fun. This is one of the best water parks I've been to. Our group range from my niece who is 2 to my gran in her 70s and there was something for everyone! Would definitely return!"

Upon our exit from the building we were greeted by an Atlantis hotel staff member whom ran the taxi rank, we were asked if we wanted a taxi and where our destination was. We were walked to the nearest car in the lobby which was a standard Toyota car, the hotel member passed a slip of paper to the driver which we assumed stated our destination, we were then driven to our nearby destination at the foot of The Palm. Upon arrival at our destination we were passed the slip of paper given to the driver by the hotel member which stated the price which was a colossal 90UAD (far more than the 22UAD paid in the taxi on the journey there this morning!) and that the vehicle was not a standard taxi but a hotel car. Both the fact that the vehicle was a 'hotel car' or that the journey would cost 90UAD were not advised when we got in the vehicle. We were asked if we wanted a taxi by the hotel member and if we had been advised of the above by that hotel member we would have made alternative arrangements or negotiated the fare with that individual. An hour long argument with the driver pursued outside our hotel destination which included him attempting to drive back to the Atlantis with us still in the car! The fare was only settled by our hotel concierge upon coming to an agreement to pay 45UAD. Still more than double the fair on the way there! This certainly soured our trip to Atlantis and we would like to make everyone aware of this scam. I'm sure we're not the first and that we won't be the last to encounter this issue. "

We had packed a lunch and weren't even allowed to put these in our locker or leave them outside of the park to collect on the way out.

Tip buy yourself a waterproof phone walker cover and save damaging your phone and also take snaps and videos of yourselves."

You can easily spend a whole day here between slides, floating in the river, and sunbathing.

The lazy river seemed to go on and on forever, with lots of different turn offs you could take, some had some really good rapids you go through. The slides were so much fun, and the good thing about it was most of them ended you out into the lazy river, where you could float back around again and onto a conveyer belt which took you back up to the slides. - no need to get out of the water and stand in a line! I really enjoyed my day here."

The lazy river took you all round the park so if you did not feel like walking you could float to the next ride. The Beach on the edge of the park and is worth going to have a dip in the sea. If you do not feel like walking then you can take the lazy river and float between the rides. it is a good way to spend a day but I would not recommend for small children."

It's easy to spend a full day here. The park is spread over a large area.I would recommend popping to Sports Direct (UK) and get a pair of Hot Tuna Water Shoes made from the same stuff as a wetsuit for a couple of pound. The lifeguards won't allow you to wear any other sort of footwear on the slides. The concrete is hot, the slide won't finish where you took your footwear off and will take the enjoyment away if you need to walk back to get your flip flops etc.SlidesThere are a good selection of slides for all ages. Most of them can be accessed from the Lazy River so there's no need to get off your rubber ring. Annoyingly, some of the slides on the day we visited were out of action. Plenty of double and single rings available.Signage and information:- I have to say this really has in my opinion let the waterpark down. It would have been nice at entry if a detailed map clearly indicating all the slides and the thrill level, and this could be backed up at the slide itself.FoodThe food is typically what you expect for this type of attraction (Burgers, Chips etc). The quality of the food is above average but expensive.CabanaWe hired a Cabana for the day which came complete with Table, Chairs, Sun Loungers, Bean Bags, Hammock, Fresh Fruit, Iced Bottled Water, Towels and Locker. I felt this was worth the money to provide shelter from the sun and guarantee getting a lounger as by the afternoon the park had really filled up.Summary:- Fantastic waterpark but unless you are staying at Atlantis you need to spend the full day to get your moneys worth. If your child is 1.2m or taller, you pay the Adult price. Would go again when in Dubai."

There is water rides for all ages, some are a bit tame and some scare the life out of you. We took advantage of the meal deal which was very good value and for a family helped in getting out of the heat for a few minutes. The beach was very clean and is lifeguarded which is always good to see. The dolphin area was good but unless you have a real desire to touch dolphins then it can be very expensive. In regards to transport we took a taxi from JBR which cost approx. 70AED, there is a 5 AED charge for picking up at the hotel but what I would really recommend is taking one of the hotel cars, a little bit more expensive but as they say you get what you pay for.on the whole a good day and would recommend to all"

I had mixed feelings about my day at Atlantis, I completely enjoyed my time at Aquaventure, the waterpark. It really is a must do. Go on a weekday (Friday and Saturday are weekends in the UAE), I went on a Sunday and there were no crowds, no waiting in line. Even if you are not into water parks or the thrill rides, it is still a fantastic day. I have been to Wet n Wild and White Water World on the Gold Coast, Australia and think Atlantis is much better. It you have the extra money, try the Shark Safari. A couple of recommendations: Take your thongs/ flip flops everywhere, even the rides. The concrete is \u2018burn the soles of your feet\u2019 hot. If you are going with a group of people, spring for a Cabana, it really is worth it. Go across the from the water park to the beach and have a swim in the sea. It is so salty (like the dead sea) you just float, odd feeling but so much fun.A stop at the TBJ for a burger and fries is perfect after swimming and rides all day. I was a little disappointed with the d\u00e9cor of Atlantis. I guess I was expecting something different, a little bit more refined. I would definitely go back to Atlantis and it is a fantastic place to take the family, if you mind paying. You are unable to take food or drinks into the park and all bags are checked. So it can be and expensive day for a large family. There were people in all forms of swim wear, having to cover up is not an issue. As long as you don\u2019t wear a thong bikini you should be fine. I did find the staff kind of unhelpful from the ticketing office (we had already booked Cabana online) which took ages to just get tickets. Our group only dealt with our Cabana attendant and he was more than helpful."

There were plenty of food kiosks dotted around the park and surprisingly, cold drinks were quite reasonable. There are lots of rides but not many for the feint hearted.

There are little shuttles to get u around which helped because the ground was so hot to hot to walk on even though my husband invested in the shoes they supply in the shops. Go in a good pair of flip flops in the hight of the summer. We didn't have to que to long at the rides. You need to buy a locker to store your personal effects small lockers are quite small changing rooms clean as is the park. Staff helpful and friendly. Our towels from dolphin bay were used at the water park so if u come from another hotel as we did to enjoy both the Dolphins and park no need to worry about a towel.

The only couple of negatives I would say is that in August the ground is so hot and we found ourselve walking on the boiling hot floor when we came off the rapid ride and couldn't find our flip flops as the stop points aren't numbered. At Wild wadi the system is much better so you know where you have left your shoes, which is a must in the August heat. The other is that there are not enough shady areas in my opinion I.e umbrellas so we did found ourselves overheating a lot."

The rides are fab and we had very few queues.It's not a cheap day out though, here's how you can minimise the costBook in advance. The website states entry was 250 Dirhams. No mention of it being dearer if you just turn up. IT ISentry cost at venue was 310 Dirhams. That's about \u00a311 dearer. That cost us as a group over \u00a340Buy pool shoes or pool socks before you go. You will prob need them. The ground gets very hot. Saw loads of people hopping about in pain We bought them in the shop before you get to the ground and paid about \u00a325 a pair. We were glad we bought them but wished we'd paid less.Go in your birthday week. If you pre-register you can get in free.Buy multiple bottles of water - water inside was 13dirhams a bottle but you could get 4 for 40dhs or 6 for 55dhsHowever there we did find one water fountain inside the park which we used to refill water bottlesThings the park could do better.More water fountains dispensing cold water (the one we found dispensed warm water)I assume they don't do this to make more money in sales (poor if so given the cost to get in)Cold showers - you will get really hot and it would have been good to have cold showers to cool downA map should also be given to explain where the dudes are, what they are and how you get to them.We also hired a small locker which cost another 40dhs (just under \u00a38) again given cost to get in I think this a bit much.The cost of the day was high, however it was a great day."

            "review": "Fun day out but extremely HOT (August 2015). Went on Saturday 29 August 2015 to Aquaventure. We arrived at 10am which is about the time the park opens. There wasn't a long queue and we managed to get our tickets fairly quickly. Price for adult is AED310 and resident AED 185. We got one small locker (this can even fit a small/medium sized bag inside. The wrist tags have a barcode which lock and unlock the lockers. This is super convenient.The park is much larger than wild wadi and has more thrill rides. There are numerous slides and lots to do.The time we went (August 2015) there weren't many queues and you could easily go on a ride twice or thrice the only downside was that it was extremely hot. I liked the fact that they have a beach section which everyone can access. This allows you to have fun on the rides and then relax by the beach front. There are two towers which contain all the main rides: Tower of Neptune and Tower of Poseidon.Tower of Neptune has the shark attack, leap of faith and water coasters. We finished all the rides on this tower before moving to the next tower. This was a fun tower. Note that you will need to collect a rubber circle from downstairs and bring it up as at times they run out of rubber circles.Tower of Poseidon has aquaconda, zoomerango, slitherine, Poseidon's revenge and slitherine. This tower does not require any rubber circles for the ride.Note that climbing up and down the towers can be very tiring so make sure to hyderate yourself.I found it frustrating that at times they didn't have enough rubber circles stocked up at the top of the tower which meant you needed to carry your own rubber circle around (can be heavy after a while). My wild wadi experience on the other hand was that they had enough rubber circles available before each ride!A key word of advice is to have water shoes. The floor gets extremely hot. On most of the rides you can go with the water shoes. For the rides that you can't wear the water shoes they allow you to hold the shoes whilst going on the ride. You can wear fit flops however these will always need to be thrown down the slide before hand or held onto when on a ride. The restaurants and food stalls at the park are very expensive. Small water bottle is for AED 13, lemonade is AED 26! Food costs way more but since options are limited you have no choice but to purchase their items.In terms of the restaurant there is shark attack and barracuda. Barracuda has more of a food court feel and variety of different cuisines (thai, indian, pizza, burgers, fried chicken) to chose from as opposed to shark attack which is more limited to just fast food (burgers, pizza and fried chicken). If you are in a big group then would recommend making the trek to Barracuda. Both restaurants have indoor (airconditioned) and outdoor seating."

However, year by year we notice that the park's popularity is becoming a boomerang in terms of value for money. 325 euros for a family of four, I find it not worth it anymore. It is about 10 euros more, than what you pay for a combination ticket for both Ferrari World and Yas Waterworld in Abu Dhabi. 5 years ago when a \"leaf\" was in the water the lifeguards would jump in to remove it. Shower water was cold and running sufficiently. You could see no garbage or any dirt in any of the park's areas. This year, apart or because of the fact that it was overcrowded, you could see garbage, food, empty bottles and other items on the floor. The attraction is always a must see when you are in the area, lots of rides, probably the best ones in the area. Food and snacks are reasonably priced. Lifeguards are as always sufficient and you get the feeling that they really watch out.Very good park, but overcrowded and overpriced."

The park opens officially at 10.00am but we got there before this time on several days and the park was already open and we certainly weren't the first to be admitted. If you are staying at the hotel then towels are included but lockers aren't, these cost 40dms for a small locker which was big enough to take a bag for a family of four. As you might expect the floor gets so hot so it's worth investing in some water shoes as you can keep these on when you go on most of the rides. The rides where they ask you to remove your shoes they are more than happy to let you hold them so you don't have to re-trace your steps to retrieve your shoes. There are 2 main towers where the rides which drop down start from and if you need a tube you do have to carry these up. In August there were hardly any queues which was great and the lifeguards always made sure you were safe before they released you to start the ride. The lazy river has several rides leading off it which makes a nice change and most of these linked so you didn't have to walk up lots of steps which was a bonus. I wouldn't say overall this park had a huge amount of rides but we did enjoy ourselves and kept going back for more. The food at Barracuda was good with a good choice and you could eat in an air conditioned building which did come as somewhat of a welcome in the 43 degree heat!Plenty of sun beds for everyone but we tended not to need any as we were one the go from the minute we arrived to leaving. Finally, the changing rooms were really nice, lockers, showers, hairdryers and kept very clean."

However, I found there were lots of opportunities to be in the shade, cafes/restaurants has air conditioning and lots of opportunities to cool down in the water!! They have lockers which you can hire and you're given a wristband so you don't have to worry about locker keys etc... Whilst visiting, I paid for the dolphin encounter (in this package you get entrance into the water park for free, free hire of towels and water) it was amazing and I would highly recommend it!!! They take care of their Dolphins too!!! All staff are lovely!!!! There is even a private beach!!!!IMPORTANT FIRST HAND ADVICE!!! Take flip flops!!!!!!! I would recommend not wearing your best flip flops. You will absolutely need them to walk on the hot surfaces but they do let you go down the slides holding your flip flops!!!!! Unlike other water parks I didn't burn my feet once. This is a huge advantage of this water park. They do also sell 'water shoes' you can wear. I recommend this place so much!!!! It's brilliant. If you are visiting be sure to try out Poseidon's revenge and leap of faith excellent for thrill seekers. There is also a large shark and fish tank (one of the slides goes through it - perfectly safe of course) Have fun :) x"

We also took the offer of pre-loading our wristband with money so we could scan it in when buying drinks - much easier than carrying cash and anything we'd not spent was refunded back when we left.This Aquapark has something for everyone. Staff are friendly; lifeguards are in abundance and the lazy river / Rapids had travellators so you didn't have to keep getting up and carrying your rubber ring.Kids play area was well supervised and fenced in so we had 2 x sunbeds where the only exit point was, knowing we could watch our son whist relaxing and he didn't feel we were standing over him as he was trying to play!It's not a cheap day out but it's well worth a visit if you like this sort of thing. We visited Wild Wadi as well because we had free entry as Jumeirah guests. This was also a good day out (obviously free!) but we felt Atlantis had the edge when it came to points of comparison."

Over priced , over hyped and a useless locker system. Staff ok at best. Some staff a bit on the rude side, compared to over customer service staff in Dubai. The locker system seemed to be faulty on our visit, the front of house member of staff was telling me, she said some times after 5mins or so, they pop open!! Which she said must have happened in this case. So all my stuff was taken by lost and found dept. instead of just closing the locker. So on my return my wrist band opened 2 other lockers, instead of mine. Not the safest! When I managed to get a staff member to take me seriously and go to my locker and override the lock, there was someone else's stuff in there.so in a panic I was taken to lost and found where they had my stuff, but oddly gave me my wallet with cash/cards in and my phone , but refused to hand over a rucksack and daughter passport. Till I proved who I was. Surely the safest and secure way would be too keep everything, till I proved who I was! Also maybe check my booking to see who we where as it was pre booked. Would I go again. Simple answer \"no\". Go to wild wadi instead. They don't seem to be as up them selfs as here."

I've actually been to all the Waterparks in the UAE, I love Waterparks, and this is the best by far. As well as your usual water rides it also has a zip slide. For an extra charge you get to experience zip sliding over parts of the park. It's really slow so thril seekers would be disappointed but it's perfect for children and adults to experience something different and also get to see the park. Also it has its own private beach which the other Waterparks in the UAE don't have. Highly recommended."

Locker and towel cost 50dhm which I thought was a bit excessive and the lockers are a bit of a treck back from the slides. We have been to wild wadi and there you get a cashless band which was great but here you pay in sash unless you are a hotel guest so a bit of a pain. The lazy river was one of the best I have been on. Rides are built in so you never need to leave the water unless you want to go on the bigger rides. Couple of top tips, wear your flip flops otherwise in the August heat you will burn your feet! If you are in a group then agree in meeting point if you get separated, it took us forever to find each other when that happened to us!! Food was ok pretty much the usual theme park food water fountains are scattered around the park if you need them. For the money a good day out just make sure you put on plenty of sun cream."

Tip is to get there at opening to avoid queues, it is too hot to queue. I think it needs one more tower of scary slides as we had enough after 3 hours. Recommend you wear a lycra surf shirt, I wore a cotton shirt and was asked to remove it for the very fast slides? Then I got friction burns all over my back. The rapids were pretty good and relaxing. Also a nice cold pool would be good. Overall it was a good slide park. It was awesome sliding through the aquarium. The floor drop was so so scary, wanted to do it again but it hurt to much without a shirt. Also wear thongs as you might want to carry them on slides to avoid walking back, my leather sandals got a bit unglued. Ground is too hot for bare feet."

We had our own towels and put them on a sun lounger. Queues were not too bad the rides were brilliant the leap of faith is a must do! Food is expensive but we just had the sno ice, too hot to eat. Also if anyone is worried about wearing their glasses it's a good idea to get prescription sunglasses and attach them to the string around your head which makes it easier to look after when going on the rides. Don't forget to buy some aqua shoes as the floor gets hot! Overall a really fun day out! Would go again!!"

Let's get streaight to it - I would not recommend this park - too expensive and too many flaws - goto wild wadi instead much better. Here's why I would not recommend: so we went as a family of four to aquaventure in atlantis dubai. there are some major flaws to this park in how it is run and how it is laid out. so first the positives - you can get meal combos which work out a bit cheaper and also you can get towel and locker combos - but this is offset by a hefty entry fee of 310 aed - about \u00a355. The staff are really nice - you can get buggy rides along the path to the beach even tho it says hotel guests only - the drivers will say hop on which is really good and shows they are looking after guests. now the negatives. there is no monetary system in the park - its all cash. so the management expect you to walk around with soggy cash or walk back and forth to the lockers to get cash. plus the meal deal is on a voucher so you have to go back to the lockers when you want to eat to get your voucher. managements answer to my complaint about this - buy a plastic pouch which they sell (they should give it free no? - it's only a bit of plastic!!). the meal voucher is a printed voucher I dont understand why they dont add it to your entry barcode (have a different colour strap for paid meals and then when you have had your meal - swap it) - saves hassle for the customer - but alas the park management are not bothered about whether customers have a good time. now my biggest bug bear - some of the rides require things like double inflatables. Now I would expect if I need a double inflatable for a particular ride that the double inflatable would be at the ride - no friends - you have to go find a double inflatable then bring it back to the ride in 40 degree heat. so you have this crazy thing where guests are travelling about with inflatables. the management should hire staff to bring what you need to the rides so there is always a stack there for guests. I would not treat my guests like that. managements response when I complained - we have a number of parks across the world and they all operate like that. the final one is small one but the paths are not sprayed and so are boiling hot (you can carry and wear your flip flops but it would be nice to not worry about such things). The rides are ok - the family ones are the best."

This is out of the world a trip to real Atlantis, great for family activity if you have kids between age 3 to unlimited you will enjoy it, best waterpark by far and the view is just perfect from all the hotel room, if you are not staying at the hotel you can get one day activity ticket and you will enjoy the great aquarium"

However, Dubai winter is like a regular day anywhere else. In winter, it's about 25 degrees celcius, sometimes 30, so the perfect weather to enjoy a waterpark in! In summer, the air temperature can be up to 49 degrees (it was the day that we were there!) and the water feels like a bath. I'd definitely recommend going in winter because the ground isn't too hot to walk around without shoes. Also, surprisingly, it's less busy in winter! The rides at this waterpark are great and even if you don't want to go on the slides you can just float around in a tube all day! They've just added a bunch of awesome new rides aswell but you can't miss the one which goes straight down and through a tunnel with sharks on the outside - EPIC! However, don't forget to bring sunscreen! One of my friends paid the equivalent of $54 AUD for a tube of sunscreen in Atlantis - and the food isn't cheap either! A snow-cone will cost you around $12 AUD!"

There is a great choice of slides. The tower of neptune has several interesting tube slides and the raft slides (seating up to 6) at the tower of neptune are great. Overall, we found the water to be crystal clear and of exactly the right temperature. Highly recommended for escaping the heat and getting some excitement."

We booked the 'swimming with the dolphins' which gets you access to Dolphin Bay and to the resort. The kids were so happy to be so close to the dolphins and play with them. After our time with the dolphins were over, we went back to the water park which is really big and has a pool or a slide for everyone. Even young kids will have a great time here. My daughter, who is braver than the rest of us, went down almost every water slide in the park.I would recommend going early as there are so many slides and pools to try. You can get a meal at the park, but the food is very basic.Make sure to get a map at the front desk and map out what you're doing first so you don't waste too much time walking from one activity to the other."

The lifeguards let you hold your flip flops or you can leave them at the bottom of the ride...it is a must if you go to Dubai...get yourself to the Atlantis water park....ps you can take up to 1 litre of water per person, make sure you take it as it saves you a fortune (top tip).....no food allowed though...."

On arriving we asked about the Cabana's you can rent on entry but they seemed too busy and pointed at a long queue, we decided then to just hire 1 Locker with 2 Towels (bad move). On entering the park ready for water action, we had let my wife have the locker wrist band so all clothes, money, phones etc were in there. We proceeded to the towel station, which seemed a long way from the lockers (basically in the middle of the water park) we collected the towels and went on the first ride we saw which was the Rapids..... Unbeknown to us, the Rapids go off in to different areas, a figure of eight, myself and one son had been on it for 45 minutes before getting off (after asking a lifeguard how long was it to circumnavigate) 15 minutes he said. After an hour and a half we had to put a call out with the park staff as my wife had been on it nearly 2 hours. I had no money for water as it was in the only locker we had hired. We eventually found her and my other son with only 2 hours left, so we crammed the other rides, leap of faith etc in quickly, but I must admit was disappointed with the park and layout. They were frazzled after being on the maze of the Rapids for so long. The drinks a very expensive too \u00a320 for 4 ice slush drinks. Wouldn't rush back, but can say we have been there and done it!!"

Spent a few hours here with the whole family and apart from the heat and the seating areas all being directly in the sun, it was good fun! Only gripe is that all the rides apart from Leap Of Faith required the plastic floaters and nobody tells you!! You spend your time and energy walking all the way to the top (stairs access to most rides), n then you find that you have to go allllll the way back to the main area to get the floater and drag it with you back all the way over there and up the stairs! Another improvement they can make is having central areas for the floaters too as you have to carry it around with you from ride to ride as if it isn't tiring enough going up and down the stairs just add a huge floater in the mix! Once you come off a slide and hit the water, you have to drag the floater out with you and off you go with little energy, 40+ degree weather and a huge floater in tow ! Lol. All in all, majorrrrr fun apart from that. Love the #SharkAttack it was my fave !!"

I went there in August 2015 with my family (3 young kids included), and was dismayed to see that on some of the rides, we were expected to carry your double inflatable seats. Now I am not one to shy away from a bit of hard graft and consider myself quite fit, but I had 3 young kids who wanted to go onto the so called 'better rides' - which happened to be on the fourth tier of the tower! Therefore I had to carry 2 double inflatable seats (which do weigh quite a lot) up four flights of stairs in the scorching summer heat of dubai!To do this once was quite a feat, but if the kids went to go on the rides again, then it was the dad who suffered! This is not practical, particularly in the hot summer months. I wouldnt be surprised if someone passed out climbing all those steps carrying the double inflatables - ESPECIALLY IN THE HEAT.Wild Wadi waterpark is smaller, and maybe the rides arent as good compared to the aquaventure, but at least you dont have to carry your inflatables anywhere. If you are here for more than 3 days, I would recommend getting the re-fillable plastic cups 40AED, where you can top up your drinks for 8 AED each time. Works out cheaper, and you will need the drink.Food is way too expensive, and as a business, Aquaventure need to review this side of their business. People would eat more at the food restaurants if the prices were at least 25%cheaper. Fast food Restaurants were completely empty, no queues and its all because of the prices, not just the heat.I didnt use a locker. I left my phone, SLR camera and money on one of the many vacant sunbeds with my t-shirt over the bag holding my valuables. Used the park for 5 days (as it was free for me staying at the One and Only) and there was never a problem with theft. And I suppose there never is in Dubai.Kids were happy, they loved the family rides - and so did we. But my kids werent carrying inflatables around..."

I'm not a huge fan of water rides but I braved it any way and had a fab time, the floor gets very very hot, especially the tiled flooring (ouch) I hooked my flip flops to my hands so I didn't have to brave the hot floor, for me and many others who were hop skip and jumping around. U can but shoe/sock things there but they were a waste of money to me as I wouldn't use them again. They do also sell these amazing waterproof phone cases so u can take ur phone around with. We also did the dolphin experience when we were here and it was amazing. The biggest dolphin enclosure I have ever seen. They spend ages briefing you on their amazing creatures. You can tell they love their animals and they are equally as happy to be there. Amazing experience.THANK YOU"

Make sure you take sunscreen and when the lifeguards tell you to lift your bottom do it! As you can get some bruises! Great family fun, I rarely go on rides and did everything apart from the leap of faith!A couple of the rides go in a tunnel through the sharks and aquarium! Which is quite amazing, we missed half of the park, which I only noticed when we were later on the monorail and noticed more slides further along! The heat is made better by being in the water but don't forget the ground is hot so wear flip flops or water shoes, the sun is beating down reflecting on the water so wear sun screen and take drinking water! There are lots of places to eat dotted around ! Not that we had the time as we were busy enjoying ourselves! The changing rooms are small and can get very crowded, the ladies at the ticket booths are rather unfriendly, don't forget to get a locker tag!But most of all enjoy! The experience was a memorable one all for good reasons, great fun and even the lifeguards are good fun too!"

There are rules about what you can wear in the water - must be proper swimwear. Cameras allowed but not selfie sticks. Wear flip flops & take them on the ride with you or buy the shoes you can wear in water - once out the water the floor is very hot for bare feet! The rides end in a different place to where they start so you will have to walk back to your shoes if you take them off, which means getting burnt feet. There is a beach area which was quiet & a nice area to sit away from lots of people & noise. You can easily spend the whole day here going on all the water rides. Only had to queue for a couple of them. It's expensive but glad we did it as it was really fun. The lockers are a complete rip off - very expensive & not that big (enough for 1 bag) & you really need one if you're going on rides & don't have someone to look after your belongings.

The water is clean and there are adequate number of the staff manning the place. Now the okay things; we had lunch at Shark Bites Restaurant. As with any touristy place, they tried to hard sell the entire meal to me rather than just the sandwich. I caution: The Swarma is too big, if you are ordering for a child, 1 suffies for 2 children.

You can then pay for locker and towel combo (50 AED, about \u00a39), which we did. The wristband you get given has the entrance into the park and the barcode for the locker. The rides were very good and there was a variety to suit all needs/abilities/ages, including a childrens playzone area. Due to the 40 degree heat we didn't sunbathe although this could have been an option at the park. We spent our whole time on rides. Queues went down quickly, only spent 20 minutes maximum queuing on the day we visited. Although there is a lot of rides to go on, and they're nvery good, there wasn't quite as many as I thought there would be. There were areas of shade on the main pathways but we decided to wear our flip-flops and take them on the rides, as did many others. We didn't purchase food, however drinks were expensive, as to be expected at an attraction. You can take in one bottle of water per person.Would recommend when in Dubai, its a great day out!"

This meant the already expensive price increased bu AED 60 ($US 16) per person, meaning a whopping $US 84 per person! For a family of four, this was a huge expense.Some of the slides are excellent, especially the thrilling Leap of Faith. You drop in a second from a high tower then via a glass tube through a shark tank! However, given the engergy-spaiing heat (46 deg C), I don't think Aquaventure provides value for money.PS: Hiring a large locker costs AED 75 ($US 21) extra. Security guards search your bags on entry to remove any food although you are allowed to bring in water.It's a fun place for a day out and a few thrills, but consider your budget carefully and investigate booking 24 hours in advance."

Having visited the various marine life interactions at Aquaventure previously, I was extremely excited by the prospect of spending an afternoon feeding the resident rays. Whilst not a resident at the Atlantis hotel, I had enquired on two occasions during my visit to Dubai regarding the timings and price of this attraction. On both occasions, and from two different sources, I was informed that the cost of this attraction would be 175 dhs. Due to past experience, I made a point of enquiring as to whether visitors would be expected to pay for entry into the Aquaventure watermark in addition to this cost. I was informed that this was not the case on both occasions via representatives from the Aqauaventure watermark.However, this was not the case.On arrival at Aquaventure I was informed that my companion and I would not only have to pay for our ray experience, but would be expected to pay for entry into the Aquaventure waterpark, despite making it explicitly clear that we did not wish to spend any time at the park. This was simply not acceptable. We had done the research, we had asked the appropriate questions in advance of our visit, we had paid the taxi fare onto the Palm (and back) and of course- we had take time out of our vacation to make our way across to Atlantis. A complete waste of time, effort and money.It became apparent that this attraction, which promotes itself as a family orientated place of fun for all, is simply out to take as much money from naive tourists as possible. After enquiring about a behind the scenes tour of the Lost Chambers, we were informed that we would have to pay for entry to the tour on top of the admission fee. Even observing the lagoon at Atlantis would cost an additional 30 dhs. Yes- it may seem impressive on first glance, but a similar 'large fish tank' can be observed by shoppers and tourists free of charge at Dubai Mall. I couldn't help but leave Atlantis, minus a ray feeding experience, with a sinking feeling of utter disappointment. I will not be returning or recommending this attraction in the future."

            "review": "The rides are mostly fun, the rest ISN'T. After having been to Aquaventure multiple times prior, I've had mixed experiences. I figured maybe this time it would be a better one, but it wasn't. Here are the various things that made it so:Firstly, you have to take a bus from the car park if you aren't a hotel guest at the Atlantis for some reason. The bus is always a tiny thing with a driver that doesn't speak any sort of language and just grunts at people and performs strange hand gestures, and also kind of decides what he wants to do and when, rather useless in my opinion.Secondly, after arriving at the hotel entrance you can walk through the hotel and do what ever before going to the water park, but once you get to the water park area you have to wait to organise tickets and everything OUTSIDE which is utterly useless, who wants to stand outside in 100 degree heat in a queue to get their tickets!?!Thirdly, the staff are rather incompetent, like ALL of them are. The guy at the tickets desk was literally only interested in begging for my credit card and wasn't helpful with any questions I had.Fourth, the seating is horrible. All of the sun loungers are solid with no cushions on them at all. A rather stupid idea for those who actually want to sit in them for more than 5 minutes at a time.Fifth, the flip flop issue. Now if you go in any of the summer months like we did chances are it's going to be over 100 degrees fahrenheit, which means you absolutely have to have pool shoes with you otherwise your feet will start to burn after just a few seconds of standing on the pavement. Not a problem you'd think if you could just leave your pool shoes right before the ride, but most of the rides there seemed to be no designated area and everybody just threw their pool shoes at the steps. This was a major issue on one of the rides which you have to carry a pool doughnut up a roasting stair case without flip-flops on! Then guess what happens, my pool shoes get stolen! Very convenient because there weren't any security cameras on the staircase to see who took them. I wasn't too bothered about having to go and buy new ones but actually having to walk without pool shoes is hard enough. After buying my new flip flops I just decided to take them on the rides with me and not listen to anything the useless lifeguards say.Sixth, speaking of lifeguards, they're useless as well as the rest of the staff. Now typically I never listen or pay attention to these people because the only thing they are there to do is moan at you for some reason. I'm not sure if any of them have actually done what they are supposed to do which is save lives. I feel that the ones in this particular water park should be named \"Party Poopers\u201d so I shall call them that for the rest of my review. Some of them were fun and joked around which was all good but then I tried to go on one ride and the party pooper starts shouting \"GO PRO GO PRO GO PRO.\" I had no idea what the heck he was shouting for and I think I would have better luck communicating with a gorilla, but anyway then he came over and squatted next to me and told me I couldn't have my GoPro on a selfie stick which was at its shortest length and secured safely to my arm. I would have rather he just told me I couldn't extend the selfie stick but of course I randomly wasn't allowed to even have the GoPro attached to it at all despite having it the same way on other rides. No no no, the party pooper just removed MY GOPRO from my stick and told me to carry both of them. Yeah that makes total sense, you'd rather I hand hold my GoPro where it could fly out of my hand and hit someone in the face, rather than have it on a fully collapsed selfie stick that wouldn't have moved if I dropped it. Utter idiot. The party pooper don't stop there with their random rule making. In one of the slides that had water jets pushing the doughnut in partially enclosed tube (not sure of the name), only DOUBLE doughnuts were allowed for some random reason. So rather than go on with my family members the party pooper told one of us to go on the ride with a random sweaty dude. We of course walked away from him at this point and didn't go near that ride again. The whole park in general just wasn't a pleasant experience. I'm not saying you shouldn't go, because the rides were good which is the most important thing, but it is likely that at least one of these factors will affect you on your visit."

In the scorching heat you have to trek all the way to your locker to get money and then trek back to buy and trek again to put wallet or money back I will not be going back and was severely disappointed, waste of money.

At lunchtime we went to the 'sharkbites' restaurant which was good, we were relieved to be in an air conditioned room and again we didnt have to queue long, the food was a little expensive but reasonable prices for a water park. We had a normal burger and chips which was very tasty and also surprisingly filling! Although the park is fantastic i would advise to go to the park a different time of year as despite the short queues the heat was exhausting, it was just too hot unless you can deal with extreme heat however this was no fault of the parks only ours.

I feel sad to write this as my holiday was so magical but I feel that this information should be shared.I visited the park with my son, the surroundings are beautiful and looks impressive however the health and safety side of the park left me feeling quite negative.We went on a slide called shalem (i think) its a ride where two people need to ride. We began moving up the the top of the drop on the ride when the ride halted, sitting in 43 degree heat after a few minutes we started to get very hot , still sitting ten minutes later we were over heating and feeling pretty unwell. I shouted for assistance and no one came, we were just left to sit high up and swelter ! eventually when no one came to our rescue I took the decision to walk up the side and get off to some shade before we fainted !! this was a scary and uncomfortable task but had to be done. As soon as we started to move suddenly staff appeared and were shouting at us to sit down, there was no communication from them previously ! I ignored there advice and got my son to the top of the slide and to shade where I nearly fainted and my son felt very ill. I as so very angry as the situation was dangerous and left us both feeling very dehydrated and ill.The other cause of concern was the size of the children being allowed to go down the leap of faith, the slide is very steep, high and fast. whilst waiting for my son to go down the slide I saw 2 children who were very young come down the slide, one nearly did a somersault and the other was completely out of control. The people watching all screamed and went over to the landing area to see if they were ok.The use of the rubber rings to go downs slides is in use on a majority of the attractions, the problem with this is that you have to carry them everywhere with you. Queuing on very crowded stairs each person holds a huge ring which was very dangerous as people were being knocked with them. I dont know why they do not use a system where the rings go round automatically and you get one at the to of the slide.I am disappointed in my day and would advise people to be aware of the safety side of things as they were a huge cause of concern for us ."

The young kiddies are taken care of with a water 'tower' with multiple slides and water jets. Its a shame some of the rides have what appear to be overly cautious height restrictions, especially when parents are with them. Overall, well worth a trip and plenty for grown ups to do to release the inner child!"

Stayed at the Atlantis for 11 nights in July, we love access to water park but the only problem for us was that during our stay poseidons revenge was closed due to technical faults, which really should have been sorted out a lot sooner, the engineer has to come from America! I would have thought that with the ride only being open for a year Atlantis would have had a priority for that company to get somebody out to mend it sooner.For Atlantis this ride must have been very costly so I would expect the company who created the ride to have been quicker at solving the problem, flights are available daily.That said the staff working there are the best in the world, friendly and helpful.One last thing, golf buggies say for Atlantis guests but day visitors end up riding about obviously trying to access the hotel, on several occasions they did make it in, this is quite annoying when your waiting to go back to the hotel and have to wait around while the buggies ship them backwards and forwards."

I will not bore you with the detail but it will be interesting to see if trip advisor are interested or bothered. In regard to the venue make sure you take your own towel, travel light and they don't like you taking your own food so that you buy everything from their stores.

I wasted 1 hour of the day pass.Second I booked my tickets online. Whats the point of doing it online if I have to get in que again. Why not all options available online--we buy what we want--and a guy puts in the wrist bands. This again wasted 1 hour.I bought food meal coupons outside the waterpark before entering. The rule is Iuse it before 5:15 pm. WHy??? Why cant I finish enjoying the place and then have food. Anyways it closes at 7 pm.I started to get a feeling that the place is strategically designed to waste your time. :p No deep pools or atleast deep enough for 6 feet guy.

All of the slides are awesome and i thoroughly enjoyed exploring the waterways- it goes around the whole park and has a couple of adventure section including the rapids and the wave run, neither are too upbeat but they do provide a bit of action instead of just floating around. The water ways are a great way to get around the park as there are exits to all of the major sections of the park and you need to take you tube with you for the Tower of Neptune tube rides.I would recommend wearing your thongs or even better getting some water shoes because the ground gets extremely hot and also quite slippery for bear feet.My only other gripe is the fact that there is only one locker area and it is a fair bit away from the rest of the park and given they don't have the ability to pay using your wrist band like other parks i have been to you need to walk back to the lockers to get money every time you need a drink or want to eat.On that topic food and drink is very expensive, i would recommend getting one of the souvenir cups because you will save in the long run. It will cost you AED40 to buy and then it is AED8 for a refill of softdrink or water. Given water is AED13 and soft drinks are AED18, you'll make your money back if you are there all day and you can keep it and use it whenever you come back."

We decide to visit Aquaventure for the very first time during Eid, and that was a bad choice of timing simply because it was way too crowded.The ticket queue was pretty long and it was too hot to stand in an area without air conditioning (in a 48 degrees weather) just to wait for tickets. Well we really were there already so we waited for our turn anyway.We finally got our tickets, they checked our bags quickly at the entrance for security reasons, and then we got inside. I headed to the locker rooms first to put our bags. There were 3 of us and we hired only one small locker for 50 dirhams (the bigger ones cost 75 dirhams) - we didn't like that the locker was way too small and it hardly fit our things. Anyhow, the locker rooms were clean and so were the showers. We took the lazy river first, then the leap of faith and shark attack rides. Those were absolutely lovely. We didn't find trouble with finding a sun lounge to put our towels on or anything as we had already arrived earlier than most of the park visitors. Here's what we didn't like the most - everything inside the park is ridiculously overpriced. A small snowcone cost 40 dirhams, a small bottle of water vost 15 dirhams, and a fizzy drink was for 25 dirhams and more. It's just inconvenient that 3 people would visit the waterpark and pay over a 1,000 dirhams in total. Some things are priced without an explanation. My advice: Go on a weekday. Never on a weekend, never during a public holiday. "

I visited in July, so given the incredible heat in the city this seemed like very nice option.When I got there the staff was very helpful, I decided to buy the entrance+lunch+Aquarium deal and it was worth it. Had the luck of finding very little people at the park so no waiting anywhere. The slides are really fun, the rapids are great and the lazy river is perfect to relax. After having a nice lunch (fast food, I had the chicken shawarma, really good) I decided to finish riding the slides and call it a day, the heat was killing me. So I went out before everybody (mid afternoon) ad found the showers all to myself. Had a nice COLD shower (they have liquid soap and shampoo for you to use in the showers, which are very clean by the way), very much appreciated in 45\u00b0C heat, changed and went for a relaxing stroll in the air conditioned aquarium. Shopped for some souvenirs and called it a day. Would recommend this to anyone, whether you're with yuor family or by yourself, it's a nice way to spend a day.TIPS:- Bring crocs or water shoes or anything you can wear and wet, paving tends to get REALLY hot and you'll see people struggling to go from place to place barefoot.- Get the value deal for entrance+lunch+aquarium, well worth it- Get the prepaid wrist band for spending. I missed this one when I bought my tickets and ended up not being able to buy anything since my wallet was in my locker."

The hotel has several golf cart type buggies that shuttle guests between the waterpark and the hotel.Arriving at around 10:00 AM, we found plenty of open (and shaded) seating space. We proceeded to spend the next few hours enjoying all of the rides. Cafeterias were conveniently located and gave us easy access to water and snacks.A suggestion to those visiting during the summer months \u2013 make sure your kids are wearing their flip-flops when they walk around the waterpark. Though the temperature of the water was very enjoyable, walking bare-feet on the concrete walkways was very uncomfortable for our children."

Having been to waterparks in Gold Coast, Australia and Hanoi, Vietnam in the last 6 months, I must say this does not compete for exhilaration. The 'leap of faith' slide, which is supposed to be the best at the park, was ok but certainly not worth queuing 30 minutes and didnt match up to ones I have riden at other parks. The surrounding rides in the Neptune area were almost zero thrill. A quick up and down a small dip and a brief slide through a black tunnel and its over. What I find strange is that there are 3 rides in this area which are all near identical to one another and are all pretty lame.The other area, Poisendon, provides a few more thrills and the queues are shorter, which did improve my view of the park. Yet still nothing that really got my heart racing.It was nice to laze around the river. If you are a thrill seeker I recommend falling out of your ring in the rapids. It's slightly dangerous with a few plastic rocks in the way but it was the biggest blast we had.Alright experience but definitely overpriced for the money!"

I went there today with my cousins and nephews they all enjoyed it! there are a little bit of negatives though :/ 1- the prices are expensive2- very crowded! Especially in July, lines are long but at least they move fast.3- lots of walking and stairs, me and my niece where very tired from walking, and climbing stairs to get into rides. lol.Tip:if you want to go there just avoid riding the lazy river It's very dangerous, and try not to ride the abyss or the leap of faith or poseidons revenge! Those are very scary.Recommendations:1- I strongly advise going to the shark attack! It's amazing, it starts out dark but then you enter a a big aquarium like thing and you get to see sharks! Amazing me and my niece rode it, and we loved every second of it! (Single and Double riders only)2- Family ride, oh my gosh! Family ride is the best! You get to ride with family and friends, it fits about 4-6 people I'm not sure but we entered as 5 people.3- the rapids, oh boy I'm gonna get hate on this one.. The Rapids was very fun! I would suggest riding it alone, I've heard that many people fell of or something, but my daughter is 12 and she survived it she even wanted to do it again, I think we where safe cause there were at least 10 life guards scattered around.4- water coaster, it's super fun, I recommend going here, it's like a roller coaster.5- zoomerango, it's super fun as well sometimes scary but mostly fun.That's all! Hope I helped"

Towels are also provided at many locations. You get paid vouchers for food before entering the park and the food at Shark Bites was good. If you want to take photographs with mobile suggest buying a cover for it. Swimming with Dolphin and Seal Lion is paid so we did not take it.

Depending on when you go, there could also be long queues though we have been lucky enough never to have had that problem.Tip 1: you don't want to be walking our queuing barefoot as the ground gets really hot and people *do steal your slippers*. So get those slip on water shoes and avoid burnt feet.Tip 2: Take a large water with you.. You're going to need it... You can buy drinks everywhere, but it's not cheap.Tip 3: best value options for drinks is to get a meal with refillable drinks... It's a big saving if you need to top up your drinks (still not cheap but way better than the regular regular).Tip 4: The complimentary golf carts, close to the beach, are a great way to get around the rides a bit more comfortably and to get you back to the east or west towers if you're staying there."

Neither of our scanning bracelets worked and therefore didn't have the opportunity to purchase any photos, which I suppose it's more their loss than ours as we had used a waterproof cover on our phone to take pictures anyway.

It caters for all ages with an excellent fodder splash area which enthralled my 2 year all day. The entire splash pool is wading depth and includes numerous slides and water features. For the older kids there is the Tower of Neptune and the Tower of Poseidon. In the latter there is a giant slide where you can race one another - this kept my two older boys entertained for a long while. For a more relaxing cruise, you can start at the Tower of Neptune and float all around the park. It is slow but relaxing.While there is ample seating with lots of umbrellas, none of the pools or slides are in the shade. This means that kids can get sun burnt very easily if you don't keep reapplying sunscreen. There is also the potential of getting really hot by being out in the sun for extended periods. The only other negative is the price of the food. We had lunch at Shark Bites which is no better than a food court - and the price of 3 kids + 1 adult meal was AED 220. If there was more shade in the pools and food was a bit more reasonable in price I would have given it a 5 out of 5. However, as a water park it is unparalleled anywhere in the world."

Our queue took the longest to go down so we would have been quicker buying on the day. Changing rooms were clean and there were lots of lockers to use. We got on our rubber ring and spent the day round the lazy river, lots of good slides to go on. You can easily spend a day here. The area where the sun loungers are was packed but we left our bags there all day and our things were safe. Great for kids and adults."

Was a bit apprehensive before we arrived (burn at the sight of sun and never quite know what these things are like) but we were lucky with the weather, hot but cloudy so wasn't shockingly bright. Used UV protecting long sleeved shirts which were great. To be fair, the whole thing was fantastic fun! Yes it was slightly expensive, but when you consider where it's built and the infrastructure involved in creating it and the sort of fun it involves you kinda do the math. Was worth it. I guess we were lucky in that it wasn't rammed to the gunnels ( could imagine if it were, the queuing might be a pain) All the attractions were working fine and staff were friendly and helpful. Favourites by a country mile were (I) Poseidon Revenge (terrifying but stunning) (ii) Leap of Faith and (iii) Slitherine - absolutely fantastic fun! Food choices were a bit limited, but in context were fine and not overly outrageously expensive. Go prepared and have fun."

We liked that you can take many if the slides together in a tube, this really enhances the whole experience. The staff was nice and helpful. We took our flip flops with us in the slides, which was ok, to avoid having to walk on the very very hot stones bare foot.

We hardly spend 2 hours inside the park and cut short the trip due to an unpleasant incident. My children were taking the Shamal ride after standing in the queue for about 45 minutes. However, immediately after the ride started (just after 2-3 minutes), there was some technical problem and my children (And only them) were asked to vacate the ride without giving any explanation. Even more shocking was that the person in-charge was very rude and asked my children to go out and stand in the long queue again ! We did lodge a written complaint after meeting the Ticketing Supervisor (Mr. Mahmoud) and the Operations Manager (Mr. James) and they even promised to send us a email response. However, as expected, nothing happened till date. Though we spent 1,000 dhs. for entering the waterpark, it wasn't a pleasant experience at all"

There is so much to do from slides to shark pools, that's there's too much to list. Some attractions incur extra costs but if you check the website it tells you what you get.

We got free entry into the main aqua park so we had an hour or so before we had to leave so spent time going om a couple of rides... There is a great range of rides and for either individual or group thrill seekers...My only real complaint is the amount of tarmac and or paving stones that they have around that you need to walk on... They dont allow shoes on the rides for obvious reasons ao every leaves them at the entrance steps to the ride but this is not the same place as where you finish the ride ao you spend time without your shoes whilst you walk or run back to collect them but you are walking on these boiling hot stones... It was extremely painful this last time due to the heat of the day and it is off putting for you to enjoy another ride... Also, we put our towels down in a big pile whilst going on the rides and then people came snd helped themselves to our towels whilst we were away...However, there is little else negative to say about this park...Buy the waterproof containers for your phone and money as you will need money to buy water and food or keep receipts safe snd dry for your food if this is included... Also, out your phone in it, you get some excellent under water or action footage through the plastic container..."

Found the lifeguards very unapproachable and some rude but all unwilling to help which is not in keeping with our experience in Dubai (everywhere else was amazingly good). Felt like we owed them something by coming to Atlantis park. An example was we went on the flowing river with my 6 year old, put him on my lap on a single floating hoop. Went passed 3 lifeguards who didn't tell me that I couldn't only to get to a point where I couldn't go back to be told I had to get out and get a double hoop. Did the same thing, passed 3 guards to be told again I needed a double with a child seat and had to get out of the river and go back to start again, asked the Lifeguard where I could get one he shrugged his shoulders and said \"look\". I did for 20 minutes and he didn't move a muscle (there were 4 lifeguards together). Had enough so finally said to the lifeguards that I wanted to speak to the boss, low and behold the boss didn't turn up but the correct float did within a minute. Not all bad as the slides were good although felt like I sliced my back on a few. Certainly not worth the money, I would go to Wild Wadi next time as this was better and looks better. Much better views also. To be fair to Atlantis this was a free birthday ticket but this to entice me to bring others which I and spend 1000AED for them."

We have enjoyed all the rides and done them all and were quite happy with the restaurants available. But thats about it with the good things. The downside of the story is: 1. after you pay quite a lot of money , i don't see why you have to pay for a locker separately - this place is trying to make money out of everything. 2. although you get a bracelet as entry ticket, we couldn't get towels without the receipt for some strange reasons which we of course left in the locker3. again they are trying to make money out of everything, taking you pictures around the park and then charging ridiculous amounts for them 4. although we weren't very bothered with the above points, this has really annoyed us. As we come out of the Hotel a 'nice' man comes and offers us a taxi. As we didn't expect such a posh place will offer us a 'scam' taxi we went with him. We said the address to the man which then gave a ticket to the driver. As we have noticed there was no meter we asked how much is gonna be , and the price was the one we paid to come there so we accepted. We needed to get to Pearl Marina Hotel Apartments. After 10 min drive the driver stops in the middle of nowhere and says thats where it is. We have said thats not the place and repeated the hotel name. Then he says that the man from the hotel said we are going to Palm Marina ( which I don't even think exists) and then said it will be double the price to get to our hotel. As we didn't had any other options we had to accept and go with that. Very disappointed that a place like this will do such mistakes which we had to pay for and I do think they should give to their customers metered taxis which are the cheapest or a fair priced taxi."

Did not do the Dolphin Bay as we found the prices too high.Food offerings were good, a nice selection of Asian, pizza, middle eastern, chicken, of course Italian gelato. Overall seating and resting facilities are good and always available. It was not too crowded but we had the \"good luck\" to be there on some of the hottest days in Dubai in recent years. So the crowds arrived late.Next time, we may plan to visit during another time, summer is definitely too hot to spend in Dubai."

I did not give a five only because it could have been a bit bigger as we did everything several times within the first couple of hours. The park is very clean, even with the crowds there was no lines to really complain of and everything was suitable for all of us (even me the wimp who is scared of everything). The only ride I did not do was the one that the bottom drops out, I got my heart rate raised just watching. It really is a park for all ages."

I went to Yas Waterworld in June 2015... There were four schools visiting on that day and the rides kept getting stuck!Aquaventure is beautiful to walk around and the open beach is a nice hang out area.With residency discount we got a pretty good price and despite being at a hotel the lines were miniscule and it was really fun! Loads of different rides, we didn't go on all of them but we went on at least 10. Some rides were short, others dropped into the lazy river were you could stir yourself into a loop to keep going up or to get in line for a similar ride.The shark attack ride goes through the aquarium and was really relaxing!You need to carry the floats around a lot though to take them on different rides. :)Overall, amazing experience. Spent 3 hours there and would have loved to have spent the whole day there! It does close early! 7pm in Ramadan, 6pm normally."

The entrance fee was 250 derhams for each adult +40 for a locker +45 per meal. Games were absolutely fabulous .I loved every one of them. We used each of equipments at least 2 times. If you enjoy being in an aqua park , it is one of the bests. There were various facilities for children also. One of its best parts was that they rent go pro cameras in the entrance for 200 derhams and then give you all photos and videos free. In my opinion this one is better than the wildwadi if you need to choose. More beautiful and various. Have fun and don't forget your slippers. Stones are really hot"

So its expensive - yes very expensive - It is part of the Atlantis hotel and if you stay there you can get free entrance if its part of the package - its very crowded at all times - you have to wait in lines for all the rides and slides - the waiting is longer by a factor of 30 times compared to how long the rides last - but hey isn't that the same everywhere. You have to of course go down the slide that has a very steep slope and after you open your eyes you see you are in the middle of this underground tube with all sorts of sharks swimming around you. However, make sure you want to get on this slide - it's not one of those that you decide to go there and you sit your position - and decide to not go - there is no way to climb out of the steep slide especially with water jets under you. So just release the bars and put your hands close to your chest, and hope for the best - at least when you hope here you may actually get what you want unlike the hope that was prettied to us by Obama - we got nothing there and so at least this one you will arrive safely and can say you swam with the sharks. There are probably discounts available but I paid full price and tried to find shade when I was not not he rides - the kids had a fantastic time and went a number of times down THAT slide."

You are allowed water so we brought 2 huge bottles. We paid for the locker and threw all our stuff in there. The rides were very fun. We went on a Friday and we were warned it would be especially packed. The morning we got lucky and not so packed. But after about 3 hours, it was full of annoying kids that ruined the fun a bit. So we're happy we got all the main rides we wanted to do in before they all attacked. Make sure to pack sunscreen. You don't feel the burn because you're in the water but you definitely get red! Make sure to reapply.They have free carts that take you to different areas of the park.

The Aquaventure Waterpark is just a few minute's walk from the shops of Atlantis but seems a world away - a haven of fast-flowing rivers, heart-stropping flumes and plenty of sun loungers. The park is navigated by path or lazy river - the park's lazy river stretches for several kilometres and provides an easy and refreshing way to get to the slides. There are even conveyor belts to save you from climbing stairs to the slides!And the slides are amazing - fund and thrilling in equal measure. There are countless water coasers which shoot you backwards or forwards dwn and up hills before ending at the lazy river again plus there are several larger slides including the classic Leap of Faith which drop 9 storeys down the front of the slide pyramid and through a shark tank (safely inside a tube of course!).There are also shuttle cars which take you between the slides as they are a bit of a way apart, making it easy to get around and stay cool.Make sure you visit - it's an amazing place."

The staff were very friendly and helpful in guiding you around the enormous park when you're unsure what to do next. If you have kids of any age it is a must. If your flying solo because the kids are all grown up I suggest it's even more fun!!"

I expected many things to be better than what we really experienced and given the expensive ticket price.Pros: Nice rides over a wide space.Cons: 1)You can only park the car at a parking that is far from the park and take a shuttle bus. After a long day and in very hot weather (Dubai in June) we had to wait for about half an hour in the hot weather until the shuttle bus came. It is not acceptable that with such expensive ticket and in a modern city like Dubai, there is no control on such buses. We waited for half hour and we did not know if there is a bus coming or not. There is no sign and no one to ask, kids were tired and complaining and lots of people waiting until the bus came at 7:30 pm without a word of apology.2) There is no transparency or standardization in the tickets prices. In the same tickets queue you can find people who paid 250 Dirhams online, others paid 185 Dirhams online, others paid 185 Dirhams and got free meal vouchers. The park website is very unclear about this even if you are a resident of the UAE. In the ticket booth you feel frustrated when you come to know all this illogical range.3) The food is terrible and very expensive in Barracuda cafeteria and you wait for a very long time until a simple order is ready.I believe the park management needs to do some effort to address all the above issues and other similar issues."

I don't usually review about a school trip but I can't go on about how great this experience was for out students and the teachers thanks to all the staff and timing of the year. Get there just before the water park opens at 9:45am. We were helped by the fact it was Ramadan so many people are not up and about so early but there were no queues - at all. The staff were so relaxed and attentive (they were driving around in buggy carts and offering lifts to people or at least giving thorough directions to areas around the park) and of course the rides are, in my opinion, the best water park rides in UAE. As far as the heat is concerned, this was not an issue as the water is cool and there is plenty of shade and refreshments within the park. Wear sunblock of course and flip flops (the ground gets really hot). I would never have thought it would be such a pleasant experience."

We paid 40AED to rent the locker for the day, which is a bit pricey but worth it as we both took our phones. The park itself is amazing, with fantastic views of the palm and burj al arab at the top of most rides. My favourite part of the rides is a lot of them take you out into the lazy river for a nice float around before opting to go on another ride. I really enjoyed the leap of faith also, very daunting at first seeing the drop for the first time but the rides over within a few seconds so worth doing a few times. We got round all of the slides doing most more than 5 times due to only a few people waiting for the rides, if any! I have read in other reviews weekends tend to be busier so i would highly recommend visiting during the week. There are loads of photo took through out the trip so, which you can few at the end, although we paid 85AED for a photo, there are different packages available if wanting to purchase more than one. HUGE tip, ground is unbareable to walk on so take a cheap bare of flip flops and you can actually put them over your hands on every ride! Over all a really really good day out and i really enjoyed myself."

            "review": "Great fun....depending on your age. I went to Aquaventure with my wife and 3 year old daughter. As she was under 1.2m there was very little she could do - basically the splash area and one lazy river ride (which she found not so lazy and therefore didnt enjoy it). The park itself is massive and has plenty of rides and would be an excellent day out for kids who are older and independent enough. Personally for her age/height group I would not recommend it as its not good value for money and is a physical strain unless they can walk the entire park on their own in 40 degree heat. The day started badly with the terminals going down and us having to stand around in the heat for almost 45 min until it was sorted. Eventually I had to make my way to the restaurant to get a towel/locker rental which is a good 10 min hike away from the changing rooms, and then back. No compensation was offered.The park itself has good rides and is very safe with life guards everywhere. Food and drink is expensive inside. Beware if you buy the entrance ticket with meal deal you are very restricted in terms of menu options. The food itself was quite good at Barracuda which one of the main eating places. One recommendation would be to have aqua shoes as you cannot walk around the park bare feet due to the heat. Flip flops are not suitable for rides and not allowed on some. Also avoid weekends - fri/sat due to crowds. Another good tip is to buy a waterproof case for your phone to take pictures. Atlantis do sell them but for almost \u00a325 for a piece of plastic or \u00a340 for a digital camera for the day. Can get one on ebay for about \u00a35."

I absolutely loved this water park despite a slide and a very small area of the lazy river been shut all day during our visit. This didn't matter though as there are so many slides and attractions.I loved the lazy river feeding into most of the slides with a conveyor belt system taking you up to the chosen slide in your ring without even getting out of your ring. I went round the lazy river most of the day. It is the biggest, longest lazy river I have ever been on.The pitch black slide that suddenly goes bright and you are inside the shark pool in a clear, Perspex tunnel was amazing but our favourite was the 2 slides with the round boats that drop down and then fly up the sides (can't remember it's name but if you go there you will know which one I mean as you go past it when you first go into the park).For a quieter chill for parents who are not keen on riding the slides, you have access onto their lovely sandy beach or free use of loads of sunbeds scattered around the park or you can wander round the souvenir shops in the main hotel building or visit the aquarium (extra cost).I can honestly say that this is definately the best waterpark I have visited so far (and we have visited All the mainstream water parks in Orlando).

We caught a taxi from JBR to the park. Arrived around 10am, just before the crowds arrived. We brought our own towels and hired a locker for our bag. The lines weren't long, but it took an unnecessarily long time for the ticketing officers to actually issue tickets and passes. We waited about 30 minutes and there was only 3 people in front of us. Once we had paid, we dropped our bag off at the locker and walked towards where the fun begins. First up, we did the Tower of Neptune. Ended up launching ourselves down there 3 times in total. We went on every single waterslide possible that day. Food was quite expensive, but we had eaten breakfast before we left and had a late lunch once we had finished. We bought a couple of bottles of water inside the park, which were priced pretty average, but what you would expect from a waterpark attracion like most around the world.We left our towels and shoes on the beach chairs at the bottom of the rides, and they were safe. Of course, if you are carrying a bag or valuables, common sense prevails and you wouldn't leave it lying around unattended. The river ride around the park was pretty boring for us, but we were after high thrill seeking fun. We had researched which park was better to visit - Wild Wadi or Aquadventure - based on reviews obviously this had one. It was a great day and by midday it became extremely hot. If you were there with young kids, get there early and you can get an umbrella with chairs near the wading pool for the shade - or they might tire out by the time the heat arrives. We were in the park for a total of 2.5hours and were able to do all the rides and half of the pool ring ride. We didn't feel the need to spend any more time there than what we did. It was just long enough and the park not to busy."

June on a weekday would seem like the best time to go as there are no queues or if there was it would be max. 10 minutes. I do have to point out some areas that could improvement:1. Resort knowledge and information -Aquaventure is massive and quite overwhelming. It could've been very useful if we were given maps or even a bit of an orientation on what to do and to see2. Service-although we were generally met with very nice and accommodating staff. There were just some that came across as unhelpful. But with this in mind, there were still members of the team who stood out and offered great service. Thank you to the Shark Safari Team, Ahmed who sold us to idea (haha) and Melody who helped us with a go pro and Richard who found my slippers. Overall, it's a great park with crazy activities fit for families and groups of friends"

The only issue is the floor was soooo hot. The park was so quite that we barley queued for rides and there was an abundance of tubes. There were plenty of lifeguards and everything felt very safe. Lots of places to get food and drinks - even though it is Ramadan. We had a great day pretending we were children again. Expensive if you pay full price - would recommend using entertainer vouchers as it is then buy one get one free."

We arrived around 10:30am which was very convenient because we enjoyed most of the rides with NO LINE AT ALL!! it was a matter of walking from one to the next - in about 1 hour we had covered most of the rides, so we decided enjoyed the rapids. There were enough activities to keep us entertained until 4 p.m. I recommend applying a good sunblock and also wearing a baseball cap if you are worried about getting too much sun in your face- i was allowed to do that as long as i kept it secured while in the rides.Also, the lockers are 40 Dhs for the entire day, but you can access them any time (as for re applying sun block or getting some money)I loved this place and would definitely go back"

The beach is very nice and relaxing with free sunbeds. Try and get in early to enjoy the whole day and experience all the slides. Don't forget to take sun screen otherwise you will come back with a sun burn for sure. Also, take aqua socks to avoid burning your feet from the ground.

For what you pay all is great however, the only thing I would say was really a let down was the fact that there is no water points in the park to stay hydrated with the heat. With this said the only thing that was really over priced was the water they sold...

We had our two young children ages 2 and 4, so we knew neither would be going on the rides, and we planned our day to spend it in the Splashers area and on the Rapids/ Lazy River.You can take 1 litre of water per person into the park - that's it - but if you can carry it - it's worth it as prices are pretty expensive! Food is expensive too - but if you eat a big breakfast, and try and eat light for lunch (we shared 2 'meals' between the 4 of us), you can save some money.If you are on the Rapids with little ones, try and get one of the double inflatables with the child seat, it's safer and more comfortable for everyone!The ground is incredibly hot - like almost blister your feet - so be careful with little ones. We tried to walk around without, but ended up getting our flip flops from the lockers! The lockers aren't too bad value - so definitely get one.The best value item we found was the hire of a GoPro Hero! They were renting them out from the entry. Get there early as they do book out, but it cost about $100 to hire for the day, and you get to keep the 16GB chip. They will replace your batteries at any time during the day. When you think of the cost of photos to buy from the official photographers - this works out to be great value and we ended up with about 500 photos and an hours worth of video footage, including underwater - amazing memories to have! So pleased we did this!Is it a cheap day out? No! But with some planning, you can save some money and have a great day (and have the memories to keep)!"

It was fantastic to see that safety was key. The rides were great for all ages! The only downside I would have is the prices of drinks - the day we went it was 43 degrees and the temperature is just unbearable.

If you're staying at Atlantis you can use your wristband to charge food and drink to your room but otherwise I'd suggest getting a waterproof lanyard for your money/phone etc. to avoid using the (chargeable 8UAD) lockers.Fun place!"

Given that it was included in our hotel package, it was excellent value. I probably would have felt differently if I had to pay separately. It gets very busy from noon onwards, so head out as early as you can. Make sure you are at the park before 10am so you can get it and try the rides on the Tower of Neptune first (these have the longest lines later on). Then move to the Tower of Poseidon next and complete those rides.I personally didn't like the Leap of Faith because the water blasted my eyes all the way down so I couldn't open them. The Shark Attack was cool but very slow at the end and the sun is beating down making it your own personal sauna-slide. Therefore, do this slide as early as possible!If you have a child who is less than 120cm, grab a double tube with a kid's seat and ride around the rapids. Then sit in front of the Splash area whilst they entertain themselves for an hour or two. My husband and I took it in turns to ride the slides with our 7 year old and then sit and watch our 4 year old. Therefore, make sure you prepare your under-120cm child for not having all the options the older children have.The food is crazy expensive. A combo is about AED50-65. The best value drink is the AED40 refillable cup with AED8 refills. I brought one of these and then shared it with the kids. Sure we went through each drink quickly, but I could refill it when finished with a different option. Also, only about 3 or 4 kiosks offer refills, so don't stand in line for ages only to find out you can't get it refilled (I did this once). Ask when you first purchase where you can refill so you don't waste your time.Towels are offered at the towel cabanas. You can purchase bathers and goggles if you forgot, but the mark-up is high (AED119 for goggles, for example). There are free vests available from the some of the towel cabanas for the young ones. Remember the sunscreen and hats! However, these can also be purchased, should you forget (again, at a high cost).If it is all getting a little hot, you can seek solice in the air conditioned toilets. They are dark and cool.If you are part of the hotel, the park opens at 9:45am. Otherwise, it is 10am for those visiting for the day. It is a good day out but I am so happy I had it as part of my hotel stay so I could visit several times for only a few hours each. This made it a fun outing without having to feel the pressure of fitting it all in at once. Monday to Wednesday appears to be quieter if not during school holidays."

We didnt have our son with us, but the kids pool & play area looks amazing!! You need flip flops or socks as the floor is too hot walking from ride to ride! As is it so big the lockers are at the beginning so my only negative is you have to go back n forth to get anything out. The waterproof wallets people had looked like a good idea. X"

On the way down, I was flipped from the ring I was sitting in and dragged down the slide till I reached the bottom. The slide was not smooth, as expected, rather it was rough like sand paper. As a result I was injured and had serious scratches on my arms, legs and my trunks were ripped open on the side. When I reached the bottom, I found a queue of 8 people waiting in line for medical treatment. I was dripping blood from my right arm, right thigh and my buttocks. When I complained to the first aid attendant that there was a problem, I was told that I had fallen out of the ring!!! I have never been back and have seen many reports in the papers complaining of the same thing so there is no doubt that there is a design problem with that particular water slide."

Lots of more relaxing options too- beach, lazy river, looking in the shark tank etc. Lots of options for lunch and all reasonable priced. As others have said, keep your flip-flops on!"

I know it's Dubai and it's always going to be hot but think they could spray the pathways with water or put some special flooring down to stop you burning your feet.Apart from that, the place is excellent & would definitely recommend it."

I went here with my 8 and 4 years old, they really had a blast all day long. Too bad the rope ride is not free of charge, otherwise it would have been perfect. Some more tips:1. wear beach shoes as the ground can be scalding hot.2. try to go on the weekdays to avoid the crowd. Some rides can take you 30-40 mins in queue3. if you are resident here in Dubai, make sure to grab a deal from entertainer vouchers. Trust me, you will save a lot!

I being the leader was double minded between Aquaventure or yas world in abu Dhabi. I literally read all the reviews on trip advisor and comparisons of these 3 parks wild wadi, Aquaventure and yas world. Conclusion I got was yas but after trying all 3 Aquaventure is far ahead of rest 2 due to 1. Number of rides.2. Fun factor.3. Quality of rides.4. Layout of park.5. Value for money.Please remember to wear sandels or beach shoes as there is a long walk inside the park between rides and specially in summers as we were there this June. Another tip is you can save a handsome amount on tickets specially if you are a large family like mine by buying tickets 1 day before from the counter. You can save roughly 45 dirhams per ticket but I am not sure if this offer is all year round. It's also advisable to go as early as possible coz time flies there its so much fun and you cannot take all the rides in 4 to 5 hours!!!! Highly recommended super fun."

The river rapids all link up so you think you're going on one ride but can end up taking in several in one go- not a bad thing but just slap on the sunscreen as you can be exposed for some time. And one top tip is think carefully about footwear - the paths get very, very, very hot! It sounds obvious but you leap in to the water and don't think about it until you get out and that may well not be where you left your flip flops so think about sandals or similar, the pain does make you want to cry!

It was right poolside and in 44 de heat great as we were in and out the pool ever few minutes.Rides were great and no cues (june) but beware as I bruised my butt on inflatable ride over a hump.All in all great full day out and the first watermark I did not want to leave before it closed"

You can hire lockers, but towels are provided. Great fun - but remember to grease up, the sun is really hot!"

If you are a beach lover like my husband and I are, I recommend it over other water parks in Dubai, because it offers a wonderful beach area where you can sunbath,and chill out after riding all the thrilling rides.. We were impressed with the park\u00b4s service, security and organization. My husband got a knee scratch when playing football /soccer on the beach. Since sctratch was bleeding we asked the staff for a band aid, we were surprised to see 3 paramedics arriving to provide medical treatment. A few tips: 1.Bring you own towels and dont bring huge bags. Towels and lockers are charged additionally. Lockers are very small. For families you would probably have to rent more than 1 locker.2. Book your tickets online before hand3. Visit the park preferably during Dubai week days. During weekends it gets very crowded. (Weekend in Dubai is Friday and Saturday) Sunday is first day of week4.Try to arrive erly to avoid long lines at entrance. 5. Have lots of fun!!!"

Make rides go through aquarium tanks.Welcome to Palm Island's Aquaventure Waterpark! It may cost \u00a360 for a combined park and aquarium ticket but it was completely worth it. My only disappointment was that the one ride I really wanted to go on, the vertical drop \"Poseidon's Revenge\", was closed for maintenance. Either way, we got to fly down the Aquaconda - the worlds largest water slide and spent a good 5 - 6 hours experiencing and re-experiencing everything the park had to offer. Food, as expected, was extortionate at \u00a37 for a potato twist and \u00a310 for a snow cone! Doesn't stop it from being a fantastic water park though. The aquarium is also superb and unique in its theme and I definitely recommend doing them both saving the aquarium to wind down in the evening."

We visited this water park on more than one occasion as we were guest at the Atlantis, it has a 2 1/2 Mike lazy river which is great to just kick back & chill out on but along the way you'll blind little exits that if you take them you'll enter other fun water rides but 'hold on' some of them are pretty fast! If your not a guest it can be pricey \u00a345 pp & remember the weekend days in the UAE are Fri/Sat so these days are busier...there's lots of fun water shoots dotted around the park & also little coves with beech area to sunbath all in all a great days fun!

OMG what a rush! although was going to fast to see the sharks! Lazy river always fun but I think we spent most of our time chasing the waves in one part of the river! so much fun!We did all the tower slides and the ramps are even better No large amounts of stair climbing.Spent the whole day here, we were eventually kicked out of the water!"

If you want a good selection of food walk to the opposite end of the park where there is a food court and a lot of different options for you to eat from.No kids with us so but from the look of it, if you don\u00b4t stay at the hotell it's a pretty expensive baby pool, if the kids are something like 4 or older i guess they will have a lot of fun in some areas.Still, this is as much for the adults as it is for the kids i would say."

The good thing is we all got a GCC residents discount making it much more affordable for 2 adults and 4 children. WE just showed our Emirates ID when paying for the tickets. I should have registered our son for his birthday as they give you a free ticket if you print off the ticket. Oh well next time. As for the park it was heaving at 10.30am. The queue to get it in was huge. The park itself had wait times of about 10 minutes per slide so not that bad. The issue is you must find a tube and keep it with you as none of the slides have a stockpile. WE aid extra to have private area to keep our possessions. It cost 600 AED for the 6 of us to have a lounger in a small quiet area and there was food and beverage service. It was pretty slow. The food was great it was Thai. The children were able to go on all the rides as they met the heights. There are no maps to show you how to find anything and there were a few unsavoury teens in the lazy river picking on younger children. I felt I needed to supervise the kids all the time. I prefer Wild Wadi. I think it is safer for families with younger children and has better slides."

Both in our 30s and without kids, we thought it would be a bit ridiculous. But the place brings out the kid in you as cheesy as that sounds. The park itself is full of great rides, the most thrilling one being the Leap of Faith, an almost vertical drop down through the shark tank. I dare you not to scream. There are a good selection of restaurants and fast foods and all accept card. The only thing that could make this place slicker is if they allow you to buy stuff by swiping your wrist band and then make you settle the bill at the end. It saves you from having to carry your stuff/wallet around the park and then having to leave it somewhere while you go on a ride and end up somewhere totally different, especially if you're cruising down the Lazy River! Other than that, this place has it all. Worth the money."

We chose the Aquaventure & hidden chambers deal for 300d. locker rental is 40d but one is big enough for most. (We had a 50d voucher from our Concierge at the hotels ask yours if they have them) It is essential to get some reef shoes or slip on soles to wear all day, flip flops or crocs are not allowed on the rides, slip-ons are. The ground is volcanic hot! Walking between the rides or around the resort is scorching hot on bare feet unless you enjoy fire walking, the park is huge and the lazy rivers so long you will cover a lot of area. We went on a Tuesday and it was not too busy, the wait time is no more than 5 min for the popular rides. A great day out but there are height restrictions for younger children which will limit the ride choice severely, there is an excellent kids area though. The Hidden Chamber is amazing, the aquariums are packed with all manner of sea life and the chambers have interesting displays with video points to explain, much better than the aquarium in the Dubai Mall."

You can take in a litre of water per person and I recommend doing this as once inside the park bottled water is AED13! We pre-booked our tickets but ironically the queue to pay on the day moved more quickly than pre-booked as they had more booths open. We bought swimming t-shirts because there is not a lot of shade available (especially where you can sit) and I wanted to protect my skin from the sun, however they are quite expensive and as it has the resort name on it you are frequently asked if you work there. It was over 40 degrees on the day we visited and so whilst the fully enclosed areas like the toilets and restaurants are air conditioned there aren't even ceiling fans in the semi enclosed areas and they become stifling."

Everything at a hideous price. The food and water is also expensive as you have to buy their, for example $6 for a small water."

After hassle and wasted time trying to get to the bottom of the problem we were took back to the ticket desks to have the wrist-band reprinted - the attendant was totally unapologetic and smirking at our clear annoyance. Our hassle and wasted time we thought deserved a refund of the locker price or at least an apology - both of which were strongly denied.On the whole the day was thoroughly enjoyed - the park truly is an experience (even for us big kids), although perhaps the rides were a bit repetitive/ samey.A word of warning: it was as we returned to the entrance to Atlantis to find a taxi that an attendant quickly came to our aid and briskly escorted us to a \"taxi, sir\" - which turned out to be an overpriced hotel car - both the attendant and driver were insistent we remained in the car despite us requesting a regular taxi until we forced our way out to find more simple transport."

One of the best water parks I have been to, having been to the two water parks at Disney World Florida and the water park at Portaventura I would say this is probably the best out of all four ! Huge variety of rides to chose from and access to a man made beach with free sunbeds. I would advise people to book there tickets online, we went to go one day and the queue was so big we decided to book them online and return another day which worked out better. The only down fall I have of the water park is I found it expensive especially for the food, but other than that I would highly recommend visiting this waterpark."

He is least bothered the time passes away from my permitted time. we were not able to complete the rides on time due to heavy rush.

Pointless. When picking up your tickets don't forget to ask for a locker key, otherwise we were told to queue up again!!! Sunbeds are gold dust so once you find one make sure you put your towel down. The waterpark is okay, I wouldn't say it was the best in the world or anything like that. It was surprisingly average. Not worth \u00a350 each. Wouldn't go again."

They have child seat rings to ensure your child is always above water which is something we've never encountered on a lazy river at a waterpark before (and we've been to a few)Lots of fun fast slides for the big kids (adults) we especially loved going down the dark slide and ending it by floating through a large fish tank! The kids splash section was great and just as fun for us. You can sit back and know your child is safe and having lots of fun, or you can join them too! Tip: you MUST buy the waterproof phone covers from several of the shops there. So handy when taking pictures and videos on the rapids and slides! You can wear them around your neck and take pictures all day long. We have some great shots!Lockers are available so you can keep the rest of your belongings safe and dry."

Thought that the ride would take longer but in less than 10 min. we reached the hotel drop off point. Its a long cue at the ticket booth as its Friday. Took almost 1 hr to get out. Paid Aed 285 for day guests and 185 for UAE residents with valid UAE ID's. Kids resident charged 165 plus dont forget to print out your voucher should u got a free bdy pass! Water rides and slides are almost similar with other waterparks except the Leap of Faith which Atlantis is very famous of. Food shops are everywhere so its not an issue if one place is crowded. One more good thing with Atlantis is having their own beach. Their high-tech locker rooms amazed me and felt stupid for a while while trying to figure out how the bar code works to open my locker! However, my shower experience could be better if toiletries are available. Nevertheless, my trip to Aquaventure is oK. Shall be looking forward to come again and try other activities like dolphin encounters and diving. Also, thinking to book a hotel room and have a priviledge to try their very relaxing spa and free access at the Lost Chambers. Suggest u wait for their aniversarry promo as you will enjoy more as u get more...only @Atlantis the Palm DXB."

Try some other day if you can. 2) Our box office lady did not understand well and sold us different tickets than we wanted (without a locker), so just check if you have what you wanted."

So, I as a writer I've used the phrase \"Only in Dubai\" a lot in the last few years, and why... because there are things which this mighty Country offers that nowhere else does. Yep, sure there are waterparks in a lot of countries, and yep, fancy crazy rides and lagoons to rival those in the US which started the whole thing off, but in Dubai, things are just done with that finesse everyone talks about!This is a great waterpark albeit it is now quite old with two more parks created, one in Dubai at the Jumeriah Beach Hotel and one just out towards Abu Dhabi, Yas Waterworld, this is the one which started it all off in Dubai.There are rides which take you through shark infested waters (ok, so they are enforced tanks with 2 inch thick lexan between you and your predators but nonetheless still amazing) and the shark deck which for those who aren't that bothered about going through the tunnel as they are hurtled on a rubber dingy down fast moving water slides. The more fearsome among you can watch the screamers making their way through from above the ride on the shark deck!Go early. It opens at 10am and starts to get very busy around 11am. Use sunscreen and take it with you to put in your locker (which are provided as standard and are close to the rides in the changing rooms) because whilst you don't feel the burn as you are in the water, you sure know about it when you leave a few hours later!You can't take your own food, understandably because some try to take liberties by taking in literally massive cold boxes full of stuff which just attracts unwelcome critters and way too much litter to clear. The park have rightly banned that and any consumption of alcohol. Rightly so, because you really don't want to to be boozed up on these rides! Food and drink is available in various forms across the park. You will need to take cash. Unlike Wild Wadi where you can put money on your wrist band, only cash is currency in this park.You may need a hat too if you are going in the warmer months. You can't really escape the sun so if you do get burned, take a hat and keep your t-shirt on. There is no restriction on dress in the park but to be fair, the park does try to make things comfortable for everyone and a bit of respect for everyone is always good idea. Yes, bikinis are common place, but people do tend to ensure they are all practical. Small triangles are not a good idea on fast moving rides, if you want to keep a bit of dignity!!"

It is expensive, but like everything in Duba\u00ef. It is not only for children, adults will also spend a wonderful day there ! Please note that the queue for taxi at the end of the day is huge"

Unfortunately there were no signs to say what level each ride was rated so we started on 'The Leap Of Faith' and it left me feeling so sick for the rest of the day....we later found out it was the highest level and we should have started on the lower level rated rides first and worked our way up. Nevertheless, we had a brilliant day, my husband went on The Leap of Faith 6 times and 3-4 times on the others, the queues were minimal. The facilities on site are marvellous, hot showers with shower gel and shampoo and hair dryers. It cost \u00a36 to hire a towel so you could save if you had your own. It was a bit expensive at about \u00a375 each for 2 adults including the aquarium and locker, but it was definitely an experience. We avoided eating and drinking there though because it was a lot more expensive, and the shops were more expensive than in town. I paid \u00a320 for a pair of swimming goggles. We wouldn't go again at that price but it was something we had to do and we'll remember forever. Yet another great experience in Dubai."

Or if you stay at the hotel the activities are included in the accomodation . We arrived just after opening as we planned to stay as long as could but still leave just in time to beat the taxi rush. We did visit midweek so we did not have to line up for long periods of time. I would not like to go during the Friday Saturday weekend as I could imagine it would be quite busy. All four of us loved it and were kept very busy for the whole day with different activities for all ages. I wouldn't say it was a cheap day but it was a day well worth it. It is well run with plenty of staff and a safe environment for our family. A credit to Dubai!!"

            "review": "good if you have small kids with you, otherwise, pretty boring. Overall: I'm glad I checked out this place (in terms of whether we would take guests here) but both me and my husband didn't think it was worth returning.Pros: - I had registered for free entry for my birthday, so I left work early and we got there around 2pm on a weekday (mid-April). On a weekday mid-day it was brilliant - parked, got straight on the shuttle bus, got tickets within two minutes, walked straight in, very small lines for rides.- The arm-bands to gain entry and to use the lockers work brilliantly. - Bathroom and showers are very clean - and they provide shampoo, shower gel, and hairdryers! Cons:- Thank heavens I got in for free, because in my opinion the entry fee is far too overpriced! - You're not allowed to bring in your own food (can bring in one litre bottle of water for each person), so you have to buy food there - poor quality and over-priced.- While the waterslides here could be deemed 'exciting' by young children, as a 30-year-old Aussie I am used to rides far more intimidating. I found the waterslides here to be pretty tame. - While we had very small lines, I can imagine this place would be packed on weekends. Some of the ride barriers indicated lines could be up to 300m!- If you have small children this place is great, but as an adult there's not much to do. As the crowds were very small we were able to get through everything quite quickly. But if you were waiting hours in line for each ride, it would take you all day.- The complex is huge! If they have large crowds I imagine this is a crowd-dispersing technique. It takes a long time to move between attractions - take flip-flops because if you go in the middle of the day the concrete is crazy hot! Take shoes you don't mind losing as well - one guy almost took my havianas because he thought they were his (not sure how genuine that 'error' was though!).- I think I suffered a bit of heat stroke - I recommend wearing a hat you can get wet. And lots of sunscreen if you're not wearing a sun-shirt! And drink plenty of (expensive) water!- The free e-photo you get if you come in on the birthday voucher is not worth it."

We were there on a weekday and it wasn't too busy meaning we got to go on all slides without too much waiting. The facilities are clean and high-quality, the staff friendly. Only recommendation would be to bring slippers if you have them as the paving gets very (and I mean very) hot underfoot. All in all a nice day with some nice views overlooking the Palm Dubai.

A deal had been advertised and widely distributed online of 125 AED per person, the offer was valid for the weekend and had to be bought online, however the online system was not working and we had been assured we would get the deal at the park entrance. We were planning on going to Yas Waterworld and so wished we had! The deal was not honored at the door and we were told you could not get the computer system to work so could not be bothered with the deal anymore. We were upset by this but had come so far so paid and entered the park. We had measured my daughter prior to arriving and she was 120cm on the dot. The park then said was too small and woudn't let her on any of the rides. Aquaventure park is next to useless for a child just below the limit, they can go on the lazy river and playarea. However throughout the day she was allowed on some rides and not on others. I wore a hat and glasses all day (with a protective band) and was on the last ride told I couldn't wear them despite having worn them all day. We had lunch which was for the children utterly disgusting. Paying the same price for a child's meal as an adults is terrible but for the quality of the child's meal to be so bad is just adding insult to injury. Spongy chicken nuggets made of reconstituted 'bits' and soggy pizza.. This was an expensive day full of disappointment made worse by bad food, inconsistent policies."

Bit disappointed the Poseidon revenge is closed and has been for a month apparently. This is the one where the floor disappears, so would have been a wow however the other rides are fab. A few tips; take a towel if not a hotel guest as they are expensive. Free for hotel guests. Lockers are expensive, apparently nothing will ever get pinched in Dubai but we didn't want to take the chance here, but we left clothes and Ray ban sunglasses on a lounger all day. Food again expensive but you can't take any in so just be prepared to pay about 90AED per person. Don't queue for the plunge ride (same level of neptunes tower as shark attack) instead queue for zamanga falls which is off the lazy river on the main path way, this is an awesome rollercoaster that leads you into the plunge ride. We even started getting off before the plunge and going up a level to surge and leap of faith. If you've had double rubber rings, get two singles for a go on torrent (if you can get someone to push you towards the wave maker, some life guards will even do this for you) it's fab!! On anaconda and zoomerango it's a different experience with 4 or 6 people. With 6 the weight improves the thrill massively! The floor gets hot walk round in you shoes and leave at the bottom of the towers!! All in all a great way to get out of the sun!"

One of them was about their vallet parking, which I was informed it existed and that I just had to go the entrance of the park and use the vallet parking. Upon arrival I am informed by a security tht the vallet parking doesn't exist anymore and that I could drive a little bit back and I would find the parking for the waterpark, and after this had to take a shuttle back to the waterpark. From my point of view is going too many ways around to reach the same point.When we arrived at the parking lot we had the shuttle bus waiting, we sat inside and waited and waited. There was no info about the timming for the shuttle and how it works. After asking the driver he sad he would leave in a few minutes. For a person that just wants to go inside the waterpark having to wait for a shuttle bus is a total nonsense.The shuttle bus doesn't even stop at the door of the corridor that takes you to the park, it stops in a designated area from where you have to walk 2 or 3 minutes to reach the entrance for that corridor with shops, and after entering 2 or 3 more minutes to reach the actual entrance of the park it self.This could've/should've been thought more carefully.After loosing 20 minutes in all of this we arrive to the ticket line where we stood for almost 30 minutes just to buy our tickets. Again, a lot to improve here.Tickets are pricey, I know I shouldn't complain because I got a disccount for being a UAE resident, but still it is pricey.About the rides.... they are really good :D, 5 stars, totally loved, and the variety is so big that you literally spend the time there and you feel you would need more time.Food: we went for the sharkbites restaurant. nothing special about the burguer we had, quality wise it could be improved. If you go around Dubai you will find better burguers/fries for the same price or even less. They should put an eye on their \"competition\".A few tips, take your towel and will save the money on the pack that offers you towel/locker. You don't need a locker, the park is really safe (like anywhere in Dubai) as long as you don't leave values on plain sight.I recommend the park."

The food and souvenirs are overpriced, but aren't all amusement parks?

Lots of rides you can do in the double rings together which is nice if you're there as a couple. The slides were awesome. Lots of screaming as we whizzed around and dropped down in complete darkness. Make sure you keep your bottom off the floor or jeeze it hurts when you hit the bottom of a dip. Not cheap but good quality food at lunchtime and lots of sun beds especially if you go further away from the entrance near to the dolphin area. Loved every second!"

I would suggest getting a ticket that includes a locker and food as you'll save money than doing it separately but not a lot. There are a good amount of rides to go on and easily keep yourself busy for the entire day. The beach at Atlantis has some lovely views and is the perfect place to take a rest from the all the rides."

And I must say I was a little disappointed! Firstly, it was expensive and the queues to buy tickets were huge and not very well managed. We couldn't find a map to navigate our way around the park and see where the rides were which made it difficult to plan our day to ensure we had a go on everything and got good value for money.  It was a real struggle to find a sunbed so I would advise to get there super early or go later on when the morning crowds have left.  The rides themselves were very good but there didn't seem to be very many in comparison to other parks I've been to and there didn't seem to be a lot for kids under 1.2m.  All in all it was a good day but it wasn't the best water park I've been to by a long shot. Siam Park in Tenerife is definitely better."

The prices of everything was just silly. It cost something like 40AED to rent a locker. If you go to the swimming pool in the uk you put in \u00a31 and get it back when you empty it. Not the case here. Its non-refundable and works out about \u00a38 for the small size locker. The food and drink was also stupidly priced. We ended up leaving earlier so that we didn't have to eat there. The rides were great. My 7 year old loved the Leap of Faith!We went and bought our tickets the day before.

The rides are great fun - especially the lazy river ride, we spent hours bobbing about in the sun and the fact that a conveyor belt takes you up to the flumes was brilliant, so relaxing and easy. there were lifeguards everywhere you looked and we felt so safe - they were friendly and took their job seriously, much better than then surly youths you seem to get in European parks. The food was usual attraction park grub - but actually a higher quality than normal and more reasonably priced than we were expecting. There are loads of sun lounging areas and you can also access the beach - we could have easily returned here, there is more space to lie out than Wild Wadi so if I had to choose just one waterpark I would go here.

The master blaster slides have really been designed poorly and don't link up as well as other parks. At certain points unmanned areas lead to people jumping the queue and thus causing even more chaos. The shark attack slide was extremely average with grubby glass and I literally saw no sharks or pretty much anything else.

I'd pre-paid for what I thought was everything bar food and drink. \u00a3500 for a water park, even with the dolphin experience, is a lot of money in my book, and I would of expected towels to be included at the very least!

During peak times arrive early to ensure you miss the queues both at the entrance and on the adventure slides. Care should be taken with sun protection because the water is deceptively cooling so it is very easy to come away with a severe sunburn I would recommend a factor 50 rash shirt and a hat!

Most rides used the freely available tubes and the lazy river circled the entire resort so you could just jump on and let the water take you.Most of the rides were based on 2 central towers with 3-4 different rides per tower. The best part was in April is was still out of season and so the queues were very small, and after 4 most of the locals go home so we had endless fun for the last 2 hrs without any queues.There was a dedicated kids pool with the largest water play area I've ever seen, it was little a mini city lol, and there was even a dedicated adult section.Our hotel had discount vouchers and I'd definitely recommend the meal deals, upgrade your drink, it's only 2AED, but in 30deg the normal drink went down too easyA definite must if visiting Dubai."

I enjoyed floating around the lazy river and I thought I wouldn't float under a waterfall or get a lot of water but You Will Get Wet!!

My three biggest tips:1. Go early. Be there at open and make a dash for the waterslides.2. Don't go on a Friday or Saturday, the weekend days.3.Buy your tickets online in advanced as they cost 285AED and not 250AED. We had to purchase at the gate as we had a voucher for 1 free adult from the Entertainer, but if you don't have that, plan ahead.We arrived just before 10am on Wednesday, queued for only about 10 minutes and purchased one locker to be used in the women's changing room. When I checked-in with the wristband, someone had put their bag in the locker assigned to me. Don't do this! If you take an open locker and shut the door, you are not getting your stuff back unless you have the wristband that opens that locker. I simply took the bag and put it in another locker, without closing the door. Two trips back in the day and it had been moved to the floor. Either pay, carry it with you, risk losing it or park it on a sun lounger.We dashed for the Tower of Neptune and did all those slides (except the Leap of Faith!) and then dashed over to the new Tower of Poseidon and did all three slides there. We did the family slides twice each, and the race slide once. All of these were done with virtually no queues. Once it was busy we did the Lazy River, rapids and torrents. Lunch followed. The boys played in the Kids watermark. We did stand in a couple lines around 2pm, nothing longer than 20min. Did the Lazy River again. The longest line was probably the one my husband stood in around 4:30pm for the Leap of Faith.We had an amazing day, our kids had a blast and it was well worth the money."

We found it excellent that almost all slides can be used by two persons (the rings are for one or two persons). The Zoomerango and Aquaconda are for 6 (rafts are used). We also loved the water channels connecting different beaches. The water park has also an excellent area for smaller kids with small slides. The only downside of the park is that it becomes very crowded in the afternoon with long waiting for certain slides. If you want to enjoy the slides without queues it is really worth to come at 10 am. The peak hours are 1 -4 pm, then it gets less crowded. It is difficult though to predict which slides will become popular as it differed every day. "

I'm sure that played a role in how much fun we had, but halfway through the day there was not an inch of space for another person to arrive and sit down, so the park wasn't empty, either. I would strongly advise anyone planning a day at the park to arrive right at opening. You can find a place to sit and umbrella shade if you get there in the beginning - a necessity for me, as I tend to burst into flame at the slightest hint of sun. However, if you want to up-spend, the cabanas are AWESOME. Just be sure to get on the staff via email about reservations. We tried to get a cabana in the morning and they were all reserved. It would have been helpful if staff ever actually answered hotel emails. If you are comparing the park strictly to American water parks and the number of rides they put forth, Aquaventure would come up short. There are not as many varied sorts of rides as there are at American water parks. However, the lines also aren't as long, the park is CLEAN,the staff are polite and helpful, and the rides that are presented are a lot of fun. Did I also mention how safe the area is? Our kids actually had a much more active and relaxed day at Aquaventure than any other park they've visited.It is super safe - we were able to let our kids go about on their own with check-in times so we could make sure they were behaving. The beach is also a big plus - it is absolutely lovely and the water is clean and warm.The only drawbacks are the price of tickets (above other water parks in the area) and the price of food/drinks in the park. You will not get away with a cheap day at Aquaventure."

Also, some of the restaurants currently offer a 15% discount if you use a Citi bank card. In terms of food costs, it is about 50 dirhams for a good sized pizza and 15 dirhams for a regular size soft drink. You are not allowed to bring your own food in. The slides are great fun and the lifeguards are very friendly, helpful and make jokes. Slides for thrill-seekers include: the Leap of Faith and Poesidun's Revenge which are for single riders. Then there is a family ride with a pretty steep drop called Zoomerango. The other rides are more tame and could be suitable for the whole family, but some may still require you to psych yourself up!"

I booked online (with some technical errors that cost me a little fortune because I had to call them to solve those issues) and I was not sure how it would work as I had no printer available and just took my phone as a way to prove the payment of my tickets... But it all worked in a very smooth and professional way.This was an even better version of the aquatic park I remembered some years back at the Bahamas. The slides were great... I loved specially those slides with water jets that take you up instead of falling down...Unfortunately, that morning we woke up with a severe sand storm... The park was open (the offered the possibility of changing the day but that was our last one on Dubai) but the temperature was much lower than usual... It is incredible to say, I was cold several times during the day in Dubai!!!! It was 26 Celsius, witch is pretty cold out there if you get out of a 30 Celsius water....Due to the lower quantity of attendants, the park had a lot of activities closed, which was pretty annoying and unfair for the ones who went there. The storm disappeared after noon, when the wind changed from the sea, taking quickly all that sand away from the sky... But many of the activities stayed closed, namely all the small food corners, forcing us to the main restaurant.I bough the \"feeding Rays\" activity, where you go in water and hand to mouth feed those marvelous animals. Great experience!!! I cannot recommend enough.We had a very nice day, despite the initial \"sand...y\" morning and the annoying closed signs on several stores, spots and activities."

Everywhere there are life guards looking that everything's going fine. However, we spent surely more than 50% of our time only waiting in the long queues. At the most water slides you need to wait quite long. We waited always between 20-60 minutes to drive a water slide. We booked our tickets online so we could go to the fast track, but there we also had to wait 45 minutes until we could enter the park. So, before you decide to go here - plan in advance good time."

There are so many different routes that you can take on the lazy river yet the current is so weird that you can never seem to get on the one you want to be on. This was very tiring! The currents were good in some parts and then rubbish in other parts. There are hardly any signs / maps around the park so you have no clue how to find things and then when you find the slides none of them are labelled so you have no idea which slide you are going on.

You can see those sharks also from the aquarium. Even with a better view.But if you still go, buy tickets before. If you buy one day before from your hotel or you just walk in to one hotel and you can get the price for 225 dirham. Usually they sell for 250 but somebody told me they have the option for 225 also. In the entrance the price is 285 dirham.On sunday (first working day in Dubai) can be around 30 minutes waiting time for slides. In the morning less people. From 11am and 12am start to be busy.No food and drinks alowed to take inside but we managed to take ours so we were lucky to avoid the high prices they have on foods and drinks.When you finish around 5pm (open until 6:30pm) outside will be maybe an hour waiting line for taxis. But there is a free bus also which takes you only to Mall of Emirates. Ask about it.The train which takes you to the beginning of the palm is 15 dirham."

One of the life experiences, I would say.River Rides like Torrents and Rapids are Okay.Special mention to the staff who are highly courteous and amazing at what they do.One of the additional benefits is that you get to enjoy the Palms, Atlantis and the scenery around because of the high altitude of the rides. You can watch the golf course, the dolphinarium, the hotel area, The palms around and the beautiful sea.Though on the expensive side, This water park is worth it."

There are some spaces if you wish to just relax and catch the sun or if you wish to relax for a bit. Restaurants are not particularity great in terms of options available but they are adequate for a drink or a bite. queuing to get on the rides wasn't an issue really and it doesn't take you long to get sliding.

The simplest solution to go there if we choose the magnet train which is very exciting by itself. We can go to the water park across the Atlantis Souk. The guests are surprised at first when they paid the tickets in advance at home via internet and they don\u2019t have any advantage when they arrive to water park. When we arrived to water park we were driven to an incredible long lane and in a half hour we could get into and during standing in line some people tried to join the queue incorrectly way and the Staff didn\u2019t keep an eye on them. Next surprise was when we realized we didn\u2019t have dressing locker in dressing room in other words locker wasn\u2019t connected to in advance paid ticket. When we bought the tickets via internet there wasn\u2019t any opportunity to choose this option and unfortunately at the cashier the Staff didn\u2019t remind us to buy locker. After all we had to find a free place in crowed water park beside a lot of swimming-pools with our dresses and packages full with values in our hands but it was impossible because every place was reserved. At that time we felt us very lost. In our fit of despair we found free places on sandy beach of water park, which was very nice, civilized and more calmer than beside swimming-pools. In addition in the sea we saw rays near beach. After it we started to go sliding. At slides was the next surprise because of 20-30-minutes standing in the line and some people didn\u2019t want to stand through and tried to join queue incorrectly way too like at main gate. Naturally the Staff didn\u2019t keep any eye on them too. It was very annoying. The buffet is very expensive which is crowns our all trial. The water park is amazing with good design but because of the shortage of good organization and the carelessness of Staff it was only one truly negative experience in Dubai."

We tried to avoid the crowds by going on a weekday (Sunday) but due to Saudi holidays, it turned out to be very crowded as the day progressed. The attractions are great and the earlier in the day the fewer people in line. Apparently birthday kids get free access in the week of the birthday; check out the website (perhaps it only applies to UAE kids)."

Go on the water slide rides first until you have had enough. After that do the single or double blow up ring rides later. This avoids any queues. The ring rides take about 2 hours to complete the whole lot. Great fun. When you get your double ring just keep hold of it and drag it off to all the chutes and rapid rides you want until you have had enough. 3. Take bare essentials to avoid humping stuff there and back unnecessarily 4. You can take waterproof cameras phones and selfie sticks with you on the rides !!!!!! Good luck you don't loose it down a Shute. 5. Don't bother with the unlimited souvenir drink container. It's not worth the price and you still have to pay a reduced amount to refill. You will be to busy on the rides etc. 6. By tickets from your hotel they are a little cheaper. 7. Plenty of sun lotion 8. Leave aquarium till last. It only takes about an hour to go through when you have had enough of rides. I've done loads of water parks and although this isn't the biggest we still had a good day there and didn't bother with a locker just took enough cash to eat drink and get back to hotel."

The best thing about the water park was the way the lockers were issued. No keys or anything of that sort they give you a wristband that's water proof and you scan it against the reader in the locker room and it opens. The locker facility is an added extra in the few diferent types of day packages you can purchase on arrival.As a non swimmer I was quite nervous but I had so much fun and the water really wasn't that deep. There are a whole load of stairs everywhere, which could be tiring at times but all in all I had a fantastic time and will definitely be back. The lack of queues was an added bonus we could just breeze through and get on the rides with no hassle. If any ladies are curious about what to wear, anything goes. Bikin's and swimsuits but be mindful of cover ups as they won't let you on the rides in them, health and safety I guess.There's staff everywhere if you need any assistance and they're so friendly and welcoming it made the day so fun."

We had a fantastic day at Aquaventure, all the rides were open and it wasn't too crowded (Longest wait time was 3 - 4 minutes).I have been to a few water parks but this is by far my favourite as we only rarely had to get out of the water!! Many of the rides are intertwined so that you can transition from one to another in the water rather than getting out and climbing stairs (There is some of that though!).The river that circled the whole park was great with actual rapids to wake you up a little. The open stretches needed a little more current to push you along but it wasn't a hardship at all.Lifeguards were positioned every 10m or so and were all very friendly with a smile & a wave as you bob past. The staff in the water at the start of all the rapids were also exceptional.Great day overall, only doing a few rides more than once we spent around 6 hours at the park.NB: For families - you don't have to exit through the gift shop!! This seemed like a great idea for those with kids who want everything."

Female and male bathroom with lockers are very clean and new. On the waterpark's territory you can find a lot of food kiosks, restaurants and clothes/beauty shops.

We used Aquaventure (the waterpark) almost everyday for a week as we were staying at The Atlantis and particularly liked the \"buggy' service to take you there. At Aquaventure our two year old tried out the Rapids ride as well as the Splashers kids area. It was great having this quite literally on our door step (East Tower Atlantis is beside the entrance) and all of us had fun there. The loungers by the splashers area do get really busy and we preferred to use the quieter pool loungers up near The Tower Of Poseidon. We went up regularly to Dolphin Bay and Sea Lion Point to see the dolphins and sea lions but decided in the end not to do an \"experience\" as I think our son was too young to appreciate it. On a previous visit to Dubai my husband and I had fed the rays in the shark lagoon and thoroughly enjoyed the session. The food wasn't a culinary highlight at Aquaventure but we didn't expect it to be, its never good at any other theme park either. The beach was immaculately clean and incredibly quiet throughout the day, we loved being the first to make foot prints on the freshly raked sand. Getting a lounger on the beach really was no problem at all. Overall a really great water park.Only critique would be for more \"family friendly/baby\" changing facilities including nappy bins etc."

If you're too dizzy, or exhausted from all the excitement, there's a nice beach and sea to chill in.Advice: Be prepared for a long entry queue, go during a weekday.

Dubai has 3 main water parks, Wild Wadi, Yas water world and Aquaventure.I can say that the three of them are great and fun, Aquaventure is the second in my opinion.It's vast and big, probably you will miss some activities if you didn't make attention but you will enjoy evey moments.Prices are not exactly like they keep mentioning in the ads because at the door you will discover than locker are not free, towels are not free, any additional request as well (fair enough, but when they mention 242AED and up, it's not practical unless you will carry all your stuff with you and keep them on the table while you're away!)"

You can even go to the small beach. Very fun. We booked ticket online which saved us long queue on admission. Lockers and changing room are great spacious and we could actually get on all the rides without queuing for hours. Poseidon's revenge was the most scary one but glad i did it and do try Leap of Faith. For AED 45 you can get a meal deal as well and i highly recommend taking go pro. All our photos turned out amazing. It is a bit pricey at AED 200 per day but they give you memory card for free and you capture all your fun moments on it."

My wife and I were staying half board at the Atlantis the Palm Hotel so we had free admission to this amazing Aquaventure Waterpark. We visited here in July 2012. There is plenty to do for adults and children. If you want to chill out on the water try the lazy river as most of it is calm, but watch out there is parts you can get put off-balance and overturn. You can sunbathe beside the pools (if you can bare the heat and not fry or pass out). Try Aquaconda, the world's largest waterslide (it was at the time any how) in the Tower of Poseidon. If you are brave try \"The Leap of Faith\" waterslide in the Tower of Neptune, which is 9 storeys high. You initially slide down the vertical waterslide then pass though a clear plastic pipe (there is small sharks swimming around the outside of the clear plastic pipe) and at the other end you drop out into a small pool. You get a great view of the park and the hotel complex from the top of this attraction. A great place to pass the day. You really need to spend a few days here."

We have also went to the Zoomerango and oh my got, my adrenaline has shot through the roof (mind you i didn't do the Poseidon's revenge nor the Slitherine and leap of faith so not the highest adrenaline drivers). I have gone on to the double water coasters which was great. We had so much fun and not enough time. I'm glad we have gone in November though because it was still really hot but nothing like in the middle of summer. So if you are not a great lover of 50+ degree celsius then plan it from October. Also the fruit huts near the beach are amazing, i had a virgin pina colada in a pineapple, absolutely beautiful. If you are looking for some nice eating places though you might struggle as there is lots of fast food places and not anything posh. If you are in Dubai you definitely should visit just get there early enough so you have longer to play around :-)"

By all means, go visit this park if you have an opportunity, but for pure water fun, I think Wild Wadi is better organized and offers a bit more fun.Aquaventure is larger, has fancier architecture, and the rides are marginally higher... But larger area of the park means that you'll be spending more time walking from ride to ride, and less time riding. I took one point away for awkward organization - many things are rather inconvenient and not thought through. I.e. you come to a ride, and find that there are no balloons required to ride, to find the balloons, you need to walk to the other end of the park, wait for an appropriate balloon to swim by and fish it out of the water, competing with other people who are trying to do the same. This all takes away time from riding, and actually quite annoying. People start saving balloons, because getting them is such a hassle, and this exacerbates the problem of finding one that's available."

At Wild Wadi, the wave pool is a central meeting point that is very pleasant to sit and hang out.

There were so many families not happy with the waiting time. When we get to the counter, they asked us to produce my husband's credit card, which we were not carrying at the time. They refused to let us in to the park. No where on their email mentioned for us to bring our credit card. Apparently they needed the credit card to verify the purchase. Since we didn't have it, they cancelled our purchase and would not let me use another card that I had on me. They asked us to leave the park as it was very crowded. The staff was extremely rude and not helpful. It was total chaos!!!! I would never return to this waterpark again. Went home after wasting almost 3 hours trying to get into the park.

If you do visit during the HOT summer months, buy yourself some cheap flip-flops to wear whilst your there. The ground is too hot to walk around bare footed. We saw a lot of people running from one ride to another to avoid burning their feet. Take your footwear off and carry them onto the rides with you. Don't leave them at the entrance to a ride as often the ride finish in a different place to where it started.The rides are fantastic! The rides are safe and the staff are friendly and helpfull. All ages are catered for. The Lazy River is very popular with everyone and as you can access it from various points around the park it means that you can get on or off wherever and whenever you like. Don't be fooled by the name though as this Lazy River has RAPIDS around ever other corner and an alternative route which takes you on a crazy ring roller coaster before throwing you back onto the River again!Overall its a brilliant day out and with lots of facilities onsite. If you do get a bit bored with the rides you can find a quiet sunbed on the private beach with stunning views of Dubai!"

When we arrive the next day, first there is almost no one around to explain the chaos and lines. The long line right into hallway is for ticket purchase. If you have reserved online walk ahead. Once I was up front there was another line for online purchases. You still have to get to a window and get bands. This took us close to an hour. Yep hour to wait in line after having purchased tickets online. The execution and functioning of staff at this point is absolutely disarray and chaotic. They have no idea what they are doing and how to handle crowds. Apparently the day we went was busier than normal. The staff can answer questions but they are clueless and lost. People were allowed to cut through the lines, there seemed so much chaos which was unexpected. At the tickets counter I fail to understand why would the staff be sitting behind high glass. Communicating with them through the high glass is challenging. Not to forget English is not their first language. You have to foot money for towels and locker. Advise carry your own towel. After 1 hour I had my bands finally.You can have all the ideas and money to execute the ideas, but execution and customer service is something that cannot be bought. When you enter inside, there are no clear signs of where you would pick towels or locker. When I went to the staff for a map, they said I would need to go back to the ticket counter, Really, you are going to tell me that after 1 hour wait at the counter. Again no idea of execution and clueless staff. The park itself is nice. Rides are good for kids. Nothing scary. My 8 year and 10 year old enjoyed the park. Water rides were relatively less crowded. Somehow water was cold, maybe to maintain the levels. Food is available inside and there is decent variety. Had a good time inside the park but definitely different story outside the park."

There is two way to get to the waterpark, by golf buggy or walk indoors.Golf buggy : From the main entrance walk outside towards the pool and the beach. Walk pass the pool there is a little road. There is loads of golf buggy running and get in anyone u will get to the different part of the waterpark. They will ask you for you room number and give u a paper waistband as entrance ticket. Then u will get off on the beach side of the park. There nearest changing room is near the hotel side tho so if u wanna get there to get changed, walk from the hotel via the below instruction.Walk indoor from hotel to waterpark: go towards big aquarium to the lost chamber entrance. From there you can see the entrance through the waterpark. ( the exit between Asia pacific and burger place) once entered turn left and change room is there.There is loads of other place u can get changed. You have to pay for the locker inside tho. Security is good and leaving stuff behind is very common. Just remember to pick them back up! Most rides requires height of 120cm so be prepared if children are too young they might not be able to go on some rides. None of my two daughters can swim and we tried the Ripids and the bubble that my husband and older daughter did turn over and the life guards were there in a spit second. There are at very goods. They don't dive in for everything tho, coz loads of kids are playing games with them. But when there were a real danger, they are on it. Walking around in swim suits bare feet are very common and ppl not swimming have full cloths on with no problem. Anything goes so enjoy!"

The lazy river is great but the other rides you do on the rubber rings were also fab! Such a great day out for all ages and groups! As it was two of us didn't do it but if revisited in a group would def look at a cabana in future"

They say that the Leap of Faith is the scariest but for me and for most of the people I know who have tried it, it's Poseidon's Revenge. Every slide is worth a try. Take your time in climbing the stairs. Just relax in the river with your floaters when you get too tired.Before going inside the park, get a locker for your stuff. You may rent a towel too but I suggest that you leave first the receipt in your locker and claim it just before you take a shower. You don't need a towel going around the park and someone might just take it for their use if you leave it on the daybeds available for all the guests. You may also leave your slippers inside your locker. It's actually better to leave all your stuff in your locker. Just bring your water proof cameras or you may purchase those zip lock bags for your phones with camera and for money just in case you get hungry or thirsty.After going around the park, you may proceed to the beach to relax before leaving the park."

We booked the royal swim with the dolphins and this included entry to aquapark.we spent whole day here and it was great the rides were really good not loads of them but enough. We hired a water camera from park 200 dinars and you get the memory card. We did the dolphin swim in the afternoon it was an amazing experience, expensive but worth it. I was just going to spectate but read reviews that you don't get a good view, but spectators could stand on beach side and had great view. I am glad I chose to participate even if it cost me 500 dinars for memory stick for photos. The food and water is very expensive but you can take 1 bottle of water in with you. Massive queues for taxi when park closed so maybe arranging your taxi for return a good idea."

If u are a budget traveller, get on a metro and get down at Damac properties Metro station. walk through linked foot bridge for 2-3 mins and get to Dubai Marina tram station. Take a tram (Aed 3/free if punched within 30 mins from punch out from metro) to Palm Gateway station. Walk for 3-4 mins following the sign boards and get to connected monorail station. Get on Monorail (aed 15 one way/head or Aed 25 updown/head) and get down at last station which is atlantis and u will be at the water park.Book the tickets online as its cheaper than on spot booking. we didnot go to Dolphin Bay, but booked for one day pass in the aqua park. after entry all rides are free. Take ur own swimming gear and towel. This will save u money. u may hire locker small or big as per ur luggage u are carrying. smaller lockers are good enough to keep clothes, showes, towels, water bottes for 2/4 ppl. u may carry water inside but no food. u have to buy food there. buying food coupon at the ticketing counter is cheaper. Food portion are big. One food coupon is enough for 2 ppl. we purchased individual food coupons and ended up in wasting half the food.All the rides are good. Leap of faith and poseidon's revenge are quite scary but fun once u complete it. Those who say no other rides are good except these two, dont believe them, either they are completely bored of life or showing off or on drugs.its worth every penny. go for the full day i.e from 10 am till 6 pm. else u wont be able to complete everything."

Having been to quite a few water parks in the US over the years I wondered if Aquaventure would live up to the likes of Blizzard Beach, Wet Wild etcI'm thrilled to say it did. Whilst there isn't a great deal of ride variation the rides themselves are very good. The intensity of the slides over on The Tower of Poseidon were superb. Much more thrilling than I had anticipated.Poseidon's a Revenge is one of the best water slides there is. My advice? Don't think about it and just get it the capsule.For those that are happy to just sit and sun bathe the beach there is beautiful. It offers fantastic views of the mainland with gorgeous blue sea to cool off in. There's also a lazy river you can float along in. Just be careful you don't take a wrong turning or you'll be thrown into the Rapids which again are superb.There's an area for kids, and big kids, too which looked like fun. We went for the Gold package which included your ticket, locker, towel and a meal voucher. The food was typical of any theme park but as you can't take your own in you're left with little option. Even though the website says no beverages you can take in up to a litre bottle of water, or so we were told on our visit.A great day out and highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a water park."

Maybe if you consider it as going to a theme park (like Disney) instead of going to a pool, then it puts the cost into a different perspective. The park is really amazing; it's huge and with many great rides/slides. We were on the rapids for about 30 minutes and I think we still didn't finish the whole lap. It's fun and exciting, also for smaller kids. There are many lifeguards present, it gives a very save feeling. My daughter is 4 years old and below 1m20, which meant she couldn't go on any of the slides, except for the kids area. The kids area is very cool too, but considering the entrance fee to the park I think it's best to go once your kids are above 1m20. One slide takes you through a fish tank, which was a lot of fun. So overall it's expensive, but I would still recommend it."

We reached the park on 19th Feb at around 11.00 am. I was happy that I purchased the tickets well before as I saw a que which had more than 100 people. However that happiness faded away as I was told to stand in another q to collect the wrist bands. This Q was moving like a snail and had more than 50 people... I told him that he must be joking. I had to stand in a Q for more than 2 hrs to get the wrist band. This is the worst managed park that I have ever seen. Atlantis PLS COME TO INDIA AND SEE ESSELL WORLD where they manage it much better than you. There were senior citizens standing in a Q as well, but no senior citizen Q. Forget abt a separate Q there were no chairs where they could sit. They sat near the entrance to which the security objected by saying that this is a Five Star hotel and not a park. Let me PUT IT TO ATLANTIS, you are WORST FIVE STAR HOTEL who don't show some compassion to Elders. If the management of Atlantis is reading this review pls try to improve upon it.Inspite of me entering the park near 11, I could get inside only at 2. So half day lost. After the above frustration we entered the park. My enthusiasm was already dead. The rides are good. There are life guards at various check points who can assist people. Food within the park is expensive, but that is the case with most of the parks so no regrets. My daughter loved the slappers area and couple of rides. Over all average experience. Word of advise : If you are accompanied with kids of 4-5 years Pls avoid going to this park"

It's all really well supervised by lifeguards and they are very friendly. It's a very expensive place though. Not only the entrance tickets are pricey, but also you need to pay separately for lockers (40 dirhams). It's worth buying food pass for 45 dirhams when you get the tickets at the entrance (you get a burger meal worth 55 dirhams for it - it's huge, can feed 2 people). We also spent a lot for taxi to and from the place as it has very poor access to the city. On the way back we had to que for a taxi for one hour! It's ridiculous IMO that they don't care for their customers better and not provide any shuttle bus to get customers to metro."

The rides at the back are the best I thought with 2 high speed tubes and 2 great large raft rides. The ride through the fish tank was ok but you saw more from the outside. All in all a great day. Downsides are price and extra. You can only take in a small bottle of water each no food or snacks. This left you at the mercy of the park so have your credit card handy. Also getting there the monorail was our first plan but it's in the middle of a high rises car park and does not run until 10.10, park opens at 10 and you want to be in early to avoid the q. The pice to the monorail is much more than a taxi and the taxi was so much easier. Be prepared to q for a cab home. We stayed to the end and waited over an hour for one.

Brilliant waterpark with brilliant staff, but the food and beverage prices are ridiculously expensive for what is basically high street fast food (think Burger King, KFC standard). You're not allowed to bring your own food inside, so you have no choice but to buy drinks at Dhs 15 or 18 per soda and the cheapest burger meal on the menu is 75 dirhams. A family of four can reasonably be expected to spend approx Dhs 500 on food and drinks on top of the entrance fee and optional extras.There is something really irritating about big businesses that squeeze their tourist visitors so hard the pips squeak. It left a sour taste in my mouth (pardon the pun). On a plus side, you little darlings will thoroughly enjoy every moment of each ride and will love you for looking ridiculous as you pitch forward down the rapids screaming and laughing in equal measure."

As people have mentioned it is quite expensive, we bought tickets at our hotel (Towers Rotana), but we still had to wait in line when we got there. One thing that was good with the prepaid ticket that we got, was that it included lunch for the same price and if you find it expensive, then this helps a bit. A couple of recommendations: -Get there when it opens, you can do a lot of the rides before it gets to crowded. It is also easier to get a sun lounger where you want. -Get sun loungers on the beach, it is quieter and nicer (not so many people). -Do not bother stopping at the changing room near the entrance, go all the way inn to the Tower of Poseidon and next to the Barracudas you find toilets, changing rooms and lockers, there are no showers here (that we found)."

My advise would be to pay the extra 100dhs and get the private cabana as you have lovely beds, towels, 5 bottles of water and fruit salad included along with excellent service in a private section of the waterpark. Great fun for all ages :) Such a beautiful hotel and luxury beach! Lots of cool things to do other than just go on the slides such as dolphin bay, sharks and stingrays.. many different fish and an aquarium. Also they have a zip line which is very thrilling! 10 out of 10!"

There were essentially no lines for most of the slides. We occasionally waited behind a handful of other people, but often just walked up and got on. As a result, we were able to ride all the slides many times each. My kids (ages 8 and 11) and I had a terrific time.We've been to several large water parks around the world, including the one on Sentosa Island in Singapore and the Raging Waters parks in Los Angeles and San Jose (USA). (We can't compare it to Wild Wadi, unfortunately, because that park was closed for renovation while we were here.) The variety of slides at Aquaventure were better than anything those parks have to offer. Only the \"hydro-magnetic\" slide in Singapore stands out as something distinctly different from what Aquaventure has to offer. Also, all of these parks have some kind of \"lazy river\" but the one at Aquaventure is much better because it includes some fast-moving, bouncy \"rapids\" sections. All in all, a great park that we'd highly recommend as long as you can go there on a day that won't have awful crowds."

However, in December we went during the week between Christmas and New Years Eve. It was the most packed I'd ever seen it. Having said that, the water park did not feel crowded but the line to get in was very long and it took us a long time to enter the water park even though we had purchased our tickets online. we arrived around 11:30 and were were told that had we got in as soon as they open ( which I think is either 9:00 or 9:30) we could walk right through without any lines. The other spot that was crowded as well was the long line to the leap of faith (the near-vertical drop). Nonetheless you get a nice variety of rides inside with different thrill levels plus some relaxing rides. Toddlers and young children have their own special area and the variety of food options is good. All in all its a great place to spend the day. Given the price to enter and the amount of things to do, it is recommended you go in as early as possible."

Thanks to Lauren, Hanu (?) and sorry, can't remember name of first medic that got to us ! As it was a birthday treat, Hanu (?) made sure the rest of her stay was as enjoyable as possible and we were given a cabana, with a bowl of fruit and drinks for the rest of the day. She did manage to go on a couple of rides later in the day. The only slight problem was the life guards, they didn't seem to react when she was in trouble by getting her out of the water, but they called for assistance from medics immediately. This said, I would still recommend the park for an excellent day out."

I don't go to waterparks very often but I really enjoyed this place much more than Yas Waterworld.This place has a very wide range of rides if you want to do more than soak up the sun on a sunbed or while cruising the lazy river.If you're not faint-hearted, try their high-drop water slide where the ride starts with a floor trap door to release you with an adrenaline rush.Also, take some time to go to their private beach. A chance to swim in the Arabian Gulf from within the Palm Jumeirah."

The Rapids connect the two parks, its a very long lagoon with many exit points, it is advisable to have your child in the same tube as you to avoid confusion. Tower of Neptune has a ride where you slide through a glass tube passing through a very large aquarium full of Rays and Sharks which the kids loved. All in all the park has something for all ages including scores of deck chairs around water bodies, it is well equipped with manpower but most of them are like statues in uniforms as they are not very communicative and helpful.

When I reached there, Leap of faith and Shark attack was not quite operational, I was so angry and then my prayers were answered. All the rides were exceptional. Poseidon is my favorite, it takes gut to ride the revenge. Watching Dolphins from far was fun, getting near them is expensive. Spending time and playing on beach was fun.Suggestions:1) Wear glasses else once on ride your eyes will be closed and you will miss the beauty.2) Locker can be avoided.3) Carry a waterproof bag for your mobile and camera to shoot the moments else you will have to buy one there.4) Carry a Hawai Slippers or waterproof footwear to wear. They are allowed on rides too.5) If you have money rent a GoPro Action Cam.Con: Lots of Walking and climbing."

If too many visitors u might expect to \"battle\" for your ride doughnut as all of them would normally be occupaied. The famous ride from top of pyramide is always crowded so u can expect to spend good 45 min in qu. Not fun at all. It felt like the park let in much more visitors way beyond they can manage. I crushed my knee in one of the ride connections, where it was absolutely unexpected. In general day was lost waiting for ticket, for locker, for douhgnut, for ride, and finally bumped knee. Towels distributed in one outlet only which is not that easy to find. I did not want to waste another good while waiting for shower. No more plans to return there. Nothing to compare with wild wadi, keep sticking to my tradition."

Actually, our cabdriver did not find the entrance, and we didn't find it at first either, but that is probably the only drawback. Oh!

Some of the big attractions, such as the shark ride and shark attack was closed, which was disappointing. But the rides and attractions that were open were incredible and so fun!!! I think that they could have closed down less rides, and kept more of the park open (I.e., only maintaining two attractions at a time so that guests could still enjoy more), as I was disappointed that all the shark rides and the lazy river were closed. Furthermore, they could have offered guests to maybe see the dolphins or sea lions as a alternative to the park being shut. Having said this, what a brilliant park!

In the end we decided to go here and paid online in advance.We got to the park at opening time and the queue was about 15 minutes long to pick up our tickets we had pre ordered, if I'm honest I think most people order them online as oppose to just showing up! We decided to purchase the meal deal option once we got there as it worked out cheaper than most of the food outlets in the park and was easier than carrying money around all day and worrying about losing it. The park itself is massive and the beach is joined to it so there's plenty of room for those sun worshippers that want to find a sunned. I was really worried that the queues would be really long and my whole day would be spent queuing. This was not the case at all though. There's so much to do and so much lazy river that the people are spread out everywhere and I only had to queue about 5-7 minutes for the leap of faith which seemed to be one of the most popular rides. The food was AMAZING. For the cheapness of the meal deal combo I expected to have a burger with a few fries and a fizzy drink but when you go to the outlet where the food places are, there's your choice so if you don't want a burger then there's plenty of other options. We had a traditional shawarma meal which was absolutely huge and was full of salad, not at all like the fast food you get here in the UK!I was really pleasantly surprised with how much you got for your money here, it was a great day and well worth every penny.

A bonus, which we weren't aware of until we checked, was that we got our lunch included in the ticket, so we took this voucher to the correct restaurant and chose from a set menu.

There is an abundance of tubes and rafts for the lazy river and rides that require them. All rides were open, were very well supervised by staff and everything seemed very safe. Would definitely recommend."

Im sure in other circumstances it would have been amazing, but I was really disappointed to find out when I got to the park that they were doing maintenance, which meant ALL but one of the more average slides were CLOSED. I later took a look at the Website, which says that \"the waterpark will be partly closed\", which makes you think maybe 1 or 2 rides at a time, not 98% of the park. Tickets are 100 AED cheaper, but still I didn't feel it was worth it to enter.Just a warning, because I don't want others to make the journey there and be let down like I was. Things may change, but make sure you call ahead, because the website does not advise accurately. "

Have never been to a cleaner and better organized place.The slides are of top quality and they have something for all types. They have a large area for kiddie slides. The lazy river has a lot of rapid sections which add to the fun.Just load some money on your wristband and you are set, you wont need to worry for cash anywhere in the park.They even have an artificial beach and a dolphin bay also which unfortunately I couldn't check out because I was too busy enjoying the slides.Tips: - Carry your own towels and store them in the lockers (I strongly suggest you hire one) - Visit on a weekday (Sunday-Thursday) to avoid the weekend crowds. - Wear a full body wetsuit if you plan to go multiple times on the long solo slides. Ones with sensitive skin can get scratches."

            "review": "Great park, go with Entertainer coupons. The Aquaventure waterpark is situated at the tip of the Palm, by the famous Atlantis hotel to which it belongs. Deciding in which park to go, we chose this one, as we were in Wild Wadi 8 years ago, and we didn't regret it. The park is better than Wadi, and it's Palm location makes it a must see. It's easy accessible by car, and there's also a metro station right in front of the entrance.The entrance fee is little bit pricey, 250 Dirham (60 Eur) which makes 240 Eur for family of 4. But, there's a magical Entertainer book (DO buy it), which on a coupon basis 2 for 1 makes a grand total of 120 Eur, so it was OK.The rides are really good. The concept of the park is based on two towers (Neptune and Poseidon) from where all the thrilling rides (more than 12) start. I would point out the Poseidon revenge (terrifying capsule speed drop)and the Leap of Faith (great kamikaze ride where you pass through an aquarium) besides many other funny rides in tubes, rafts,...Apart from the rides, you have an access to the beach, so you can have a dip in the sea as well. Throughout the park and on the beach, there are enough sunbeds, but take your own towels, because their for rent are expensive (7 Eur)."

Good thing we pre-ordered our tickets online hence could skip the queue. We bought a combo pass for this and the Lost Chamber's Aquarium for 300AED. The waterpark had plenty of lounge chairs (because we got there early) and we situated ourselves in front of one of the lazy pool exits close to food and drink stalls. Floaties were a plenty and you need not hoard one and carry it all over the place like other waterparks. Towels are also free to rent. I injured my ankle whilst on one of the water rides and the paramedic in charge was fantastic! The way the staff at the waterpark handled an injury situation showed professionalism and great care even if I was not one of the guests staying at the hotel. I only made it to the one water slide, but it was extremely fun whilst it lasted because I got to see a small bit of the aquarium on the way down."

Been there on december, 21 2014.Not so crowded, it was sunday which is a weekday in Dubai.General entrance for adults AED 285 (1 AED = 0.27 USD).Before going I suggest that you check with your hotel concierge. We were guests at Fairmont The Palm and and got a voucher to pay AED 250 each.The park is very well organized and clean.The attractions are good but not the variety you found at Orlando (USA) water parks.A nice space with attractions exclusively for kids in a private \"beach\".Speaking of beaches, you have access to a beautiful Gulf beach, with a lot of umbrellas and chairs for use, very, very nice. It's a plus, no doubt.Lockers: AED 40 each.Towels: AED 30 each.Combo towel/locker: AED 50.I think it's better to bring your own hotel beach towel. We did that.A not so good thing: the lockers are situated at the very entrance of the park. If you stay at the beach it's a long walk to pick up things from the locker.The park is part of the Atlantis Hotel complex and I believe that guests at the hotel have some privileges at the park."

To start with we had a great day, end of December with the sun as weak as can be in Dubai (close to the winter solstice). I did not, fair skinned as I am, need any sun protection and the temperature out on the Palm was about 23-26 celsius. Conditions where great! I had a great time on all the waterrides. We arrived at 10.00 and left at sun down at 17.30. Staff/guards where effective and friendly and all together we had a great and memorable day wiith different kinds of rides being thrilling or lovely enjoyable. There are plenty of places to relax at and even a beach! The beach held at least two volley ball courts!there are plenty of places to buy food and drinks - maybe not much quality foods but ok burgers or sharmas.Now to the buts:-Being a western woman I was at one point approached by an arabic man at the childrens water climby wooden castle - when I was occupied with dodging falling water in a shadier place of the play castle I was approached by a man from behind that put his hand on my bum and feined an interest in what I was doing and then he followed me around the play-castle. I was a bit chocked and took refuge by standing in an open sunny place - but the feeling of beeing lightly molested did not feel good. I would warn other female visitors of \"touchy hands\".-when we arrived at 10.00 (opening hour) it took one full hour just to buy tickets and enter the park as the ticket sales could be better planned.-the park is rather pricy but still you have to pay extra for lockers and towls - I strongly think this should be included in the price.Except for these buts I loved Dubais Atlantis Aquaventure and would definitley visit it again!"

There's only about 12ish in total so you'll find you've done all the slides by lunchtime if you arrive at 10am when the park opens. The park is similar to Siam Park in Teneife. The biggest ommision is the lack of a wave machine.Avoid the private beach as it is stoney, difficult to walk on and has stagnant water.. (goto JBR beach which is nearby, free, has beautiful sand, breakers and a promenade with restaurants and facilities)If you stay right to the end of the day, be aware that taxis queues will be long and you'll sit in a traffic Jam waiting to get off the Palm."

You must take lots of bottled water as its so hot and they'll only get you buying expensive drinks if not. A couple of times i had to go in a shop as i felt like i was going to pass out with the heat even though i had a hat on and had water on me. Husband went on the leap of faith a couple of times but waited until the end of the day to go on as it was a lot quieter. I was 'persuaded' to go on a very gentle water rapid ride where you sit on inflatable rings together and glide through tunnels and swells. I must admit i enjoyed that although there was a couple of hairy moments where the rapids picked up a bit and i thought i was going to fall in and drown....Slight exaggeration on my part!! Husband managed to calm me down and it was ok in the end and i went on it twice.Just take water and high sunscreen!."

First off, I like to think positively and make the best of any situation, however Aquaventure made it difficult for me to do so.I understand that the park may be busy, especially at this time of year, but it should be noted that any attempt to visit this park should be under the knowledge that you will not be able to get very much done.We were in Dubai, a city of many wonders, for 2 days, so with minimal time I had to choose my most desired sites to visit, the Aquaventure being #1. Purchasing tickets online seemed to be the best option to avoid queues, but alas there is a queue to pick up those tickets, 30 minutes.Once inside, the water park is crammed full. It takes far too long to be able to enjoy the slides. In four hours, I managed to do 2 slides before giving up. I had to leave the line at the Leap of Faith as they let people slide once every 30 seconds. Calculating the amount of people in the line meant that if wait for 40 minutes after waiting nearly that time already. At the top, people were too scared to go and wasting time for everyone.Even getting a deck chair is hard because people just throw their towels all over them.I understand it is busy, but if park management is going to let in thousands of people and take their money, they need to cater for these thousands of people.I was looking forward to Aquaventure but I left feeling bitter and cheated of my money. Some people may have a great time there, and I am genuinely gladFor them, but in my opinion I wasted a day here that could've been spent better paddle boarding or enjoying another Dubai beach."

If you are looking for thrill, I guess you just need to do two of two rides: The Leap of Faith and Aquaconda - the rest may sound unique but are not as thrilling and much different from the two. However, you can easily spend the entire day and have a great day if you come with toddlers. There is enough you can do with your little ones as well. If you are considering visiting the Lost Chambers, I would suggest you rather visit the Aquarium & the Underwater Zoo at the Dubai Mall."

Reckon young teens up is the sweet spot for all the ridesAbsolute recommendation is you book a return car - the queue for the taxi rank upon leaving was humongous!

Also, don't take a taxi there because the queue to get a taxi at the end of the night is ridiculous. Take the metro or drive. There is parking and it will be free if you get a stamp at the ticket office.Lots of thrill seeking rides. The longest I queued for was about 45 mins but that was for the big vertical drop one ( leap of faith) which was awesome! I chickened out of the doing the ones where the floor drops beneath you. A variety of rides for all ages. Plenty of sun loungers. I would definitely get the towel and locker combo...the towels are huge and keep you warm and snug when you lounge about ( I went in winter so there was a little chill at times when I got out) the water wasn't too bad...not hot, but not freezing. The food is pricey though so brace yourself. We had a mini chicken sandwich which was 38aed ( \u00a36) and drinks were around 13aed ( \u00a32:50) you can't take in food but can take in a bottle of water per person. We did finish the park within about 4/5 hours and decided to get changed and lounge about on the beach. That it itself was enjoyable. It's a pretty big park with lots to do for all ages. The ticket is pricey as you would expect but we had the entertainer book which has buy 1 get 1 free. I would recommend it as it also has the same for the kaleidoscope buffet and the lost chambers aquarium."

We did not experience any waiting time at all untill 1400. There are lots of sunbeds by the many pools, and the beach is also nice. Tip no 1: come at 10 am to experience the most popular rides for some hours before the queing starts.Tip no 2: bring one bag for your clothes, a book and sunscreen (and a towel if you don't want to hire an expensive one there), to place by your sunbed when you arrive. And bring one small bag to put your camera, money and other valuables in, to be placed in a locker. Tip no 3: You only need one small locker per family. There are several locker stations, so choose one close to your sunbed area, to be able to get your money and camera when needed.Enjoy!"

            "review": "Very long and badly managed queue. Having read a number of reviews on and off TA we decided to book online (thoroughly recommend this - cheaper and shorter queue) and visit Aquaventure over Wild Wadi Waterpark (hard to choose between them and we haven't visited WWW so can't compare). We have three kids, 10, 8 and 5. We arrived at 11:30 (park opened at 10am) and parked in the car park. All went smoothly. Short shuttle bus trip to entrance. Appeared quite quiet......UNTIL WE TURNED A CORNER INSIDE THE ENTRANCE SHOPPING ARCADE TO HEAD FOR THE PARK AND HIT A MASSIVE QUEUE. The worst part about this was how badly sign posted and managed it was. The staff were all pleasant and friendly (actually overall this was the case throughout the day) but it was very poorly managed and tensions began to run very high as people queue jumped (innocently or otherwise) and others started to take policing the queue into their own hands. It took us 1h10 to collect our wrist bands so we could enter the park and we were lucky that we stumbled into the right queue. Had we arrived 10 mins later it would have taken another 30 mins just to get to someone to ask which queue we should be in. I reckon the queue to buy tickets there was probably about 30 mins longer than ours. I recommend you get there at 9:15. We actually had a fun day. A few other things I would liked to have known:1 - you can rent towels - 30 AED2 - take a big locker rather than a std one 75 AED vs 40 AED or take two, one for boys and one for girls 3 - the last ride closes at 17:15 so it's quite a short day - another reason to get there early4 - we bought the park and aquarium combo - I wasn't expecting much having been to plenty aquariums but this one was very well done and kept the whole family entertained after a full on day - also queue was minimal even at 17:45 when everyone was leaving the waterpark5 - drive - the queue for the monorail looked huge at 17:15 as the park closed and the queue for a taxi looked huge too when we were leaving at around 19:306 - the food in the park was actually quite good and not extortionate the way it sometimes can be (eg awful and v pricey at Disneyland Paris!)7 - the place, esp inside the park, was v well staffed with really friendly people and endless lifeguards. Always felt like the kids would be safe - even though they were always with us. 8 - a lot of the rides have 1.2m height restrictions so it's quite limiting if you all want to ride together and the younger member(s) isn't quite tall enough yet. 9 - ride queues weren't that bad10 - beach was really nice to relax on11 - get to the change rooms around 16:45 before the actual close - it gets very full and very messy as everyone tries to get changed once the park has closed We would have given the day a 4 star rating had it not been for the awful start. A park like this run by a hotel group like Kerzner Int should be ashamed of the appalling crowd control and expectation management they presided over this morning. Come on guys, you can do better."

So what more could you ask for than to improve on the chaotic ticket purchase hall. You are well advised to purchase online...the blurb on the website implies that you get through quicker by doing this. If you think you might need a locker for your stuff the go for a silver or gold package deal which means you have a small locker and a towel thrown in rather than pay for the locker separately. We got 2 gold tickets in a party of 5. This enabled purchase of a locker for the ladies in their changing room and the fellows shared a locker in the men's room and we got 2 towels thrown in plus 2 meals. We the bought 3 day tickets to make up the 5 entry tickets. We did pay for the zip line experience but found it a bit tame. Getting to the venue by tram and monorail may work out quicker as big queues build up for taxis and the like especiLly when the venue closes inthe evening."

Despite this they both thoroughly enjoyed the splash zone and all of us could go on the torrents and rapids which surround the entire Park. The park was very clean and well organized with excellent staff always at hand! A few bits of advice. The park opens at 10 and that's the best time to get there. If you have younger kids the tubes with \"child seats\" are needed for the rapids and torrents. These tubes are easy to find earlier on but as the day goes on they become much tougher to find. Grab yours and keep them with you! Same goes for the deck chairs. They go fast (especially those in the shade and around the splash zone). Put your towel on it and stake your claim early! Finally the park closes at sunset. Try and leave a little before closing time. We could not get a cab back after waiting for over 45 minutes with 2 whinny tired kids. Eventually settled for the Atlantis hotel car and paid three times what we paid getting there! Although we were assured by the staff this is usually not the case and that this was due to the increased rush around the holiday season."

The children's area is awesome with slides to suit all ages and confidence levels. There is lots of seating and amenities nearby for parents. The lazy river rides and rapids are huge fun and the double river chairs have a child seat to ensure your little ones are not going to slip through into the water. It is great fun and also as relaxing as you want it to be. For the more brave, the bigger slides are huge fun and the Leap of Faith is a true adventure! Just remember to keep your eyes open when going through the shark tank :-) The tube rides that shoot you up and down and through dark tunnels are the best fun and my 5 year old loved it (as did I). There are secure lockers for your things. Lots of food places, shops with souvenirs and essentials etc. I think it is expensive if you are paying for it (it is included in your room rate as a Atlantis Guest), but worth the money as its great fun.

My advice is to arrive around 9.30am as this all takes time and the park opens at 10am. I was initially worried that the water would be too cold in December but it was fine, a little on the chilly side but it didn't bother us at all - we were having too much fun!!!The rides are fantastic, especially the new Tower of Poseidon which has the Aquaconda, a 6 person raft adventure and Zoomerango - another 6 person raft ride. Then there's Poseidon's Revenge - if you're brave enough!. Two capsules have trap doors which suddenly open and starts you on you slide experience where you'll travel up to 60km/hr through a tube! Oh there's also the new zipline, which we didn't go on as it's extra but looked fun. The rest of the rides were all brilliant too. If you are in need of a little relaxation then the lazy river is fun but remember there are rapids along the way so it all makes for a brilliant ride! The one ride I enjoyed most was probably Shark Attack which is in the Tower of Neptune. We took a double tube though darkness emerging through the shark-filled lagoon giving you time to spot all the fish and sharks but safe inside the see-through tube of course!! The food available was of a good standard but not the widest of choices and mostly fast food. I really fancied hummus, tabouleh and chicken kebabs but no luck. I'm gluten free and it's always tricky to find something I can eat but the guy did offer me plain grilled chicken and salad so can't complain.Overall, a fun-filled day and out of all the water parks I have been to through-out the Middle East, this is my favourite one. .

We almost didnt occur that we had to wait for going on a slide (maybe because during the week, and seasonal). We just had to wait at the two slides that go through the Shark Aquarium. Admission prices are somewhat high, we paid about 50\u20ac per person. Additonal to that a 10\u20ac fee per locker (optional). The staff is very friendly and attentive, and sometimes even funny.We spent almost the whole day there to manage to go on a ride on every slide (as mentioned almost no queues), so I suggest to plan a whole day for this.In conclusion: Be careful, the slides are really addictive ;)"

Lots of fun slides on the new tower (bit of a walk over) but seems to less busy then the one closer to the entrance. Keep your samdals with you, I know this sounds strange but the cement is really hot and you always seem to end up where you left them after getting off the slide. They also check and take water away if you have it in your baggage - such a pathetic thing to do but nothing we can do. Enjoy!"

Then the kids splash area which is amazing!!! Massive house to climb up with buckets of water to tip, water guns to shoot, so many things to twist and turn - the kids and us adults were in heaven. 5 different slides here and our 3 year olds loved them all - the life savers were also first class with looking after kids who come off the slide and connecting them with parents coming down to collect them. The park is extremely well covered with life savers all of who were so happy and friendly, really made it fun! Food was normal fast food but not terribly expensive.My warnings here if coming with small kids is, firstly, it's cold water this time of year!!! My kids teeth were both chattering a lot! And secondly the park is huge - so if you leave you towels etc in one section you may have a long long walk to get back after some rides!!"

FYI there is a weight limit for some rides (120kg) and some for other rides (136kg) and a height minimum for some of the rides. Lucky this didn't affect us but it may affect some. The tubing around the place was quite slow so we mainly opted to get off and walk to the next slide. FYI - i was concerned about clothing - I wanted to wear a top or sarong over my bathers however was advised online and in the rules that only swimsuits to be worn. I ended up doing this and didn't care as I was too busy having fun. However I did notice some people wearing street clothes (singlets, leggings etc). So I don't think they patrol it much. Overall it was so much fun and we would definitely go back!"

Great waterpark!Be prepared to put your hand in your pocket when visiting Atlantis. Everywhere you go there are 'extras' When arriving you get a wristband to allow u to enter the waterpark. There is a charge if you want to use a locker. You also have to pay to hire a towel for the day.We got the combo although I really had to squeeze everything into a small locker.1 Towel 1locker combo 50aed (small locker)Large locker available extra chargeTowel 30aedWristband given for use of the locker.Security check of bags before you enter the waterpark.. No food/drinks to be taken in. Changing rooms are men & women separate no family room. They are really quite small rooms too which I found hard work getting me and my 2 year old ready. Hairdryers available in changing rooms. :-)To get a locked just scan your locker wristband on the infrared screen, the locker is assigned to u in that section. Easy to use. We took our 2yo to the children's area she had a blast, lots of slides waterfalls the water isn't too deep. There's a big bucket that fills with water and tips every so often everyone loved it!! Fast food available everywhere shark bites offers the usual burger chips hotdog... Barracudas more choice Asia Republic express... Shawarma... Pizza. We ate at Asia Republic which was great. Also check out dolphin bay, at 2pm we got to view the dolphins and see people who got to swim with them. Overall a great day out."

Don't get frightened when you see the crowd at the gate. Everybody can easily fit in as the area is very large. We didn't feel like standing in the queue, so we paid 300 AED extra (for two adults) and took a private cabana. They guided us to the cabana personally. In cabana you have sunbeds for the whole day, water and fruits. You can order food there as well. Very good service. There is an age limit though for this cabana service, so if you have small children, you should choose some other option. The area is beautiful and clean and well maintained. It was a lot of fun to try different kind of rides and slides and at times have a break and just relax on your sun bed. Go there early, as the time flies when you are in the water (the place closes after sun set). If I had to choose between this and Wild Wadi - I'd definitely choose this park. If you want to avoid that ridiculous taxi queue after closing \u2013 leave well before the place closes or take the Monorail to the \u201cmain land\u201d and take a taxi from the station where it stops. We did that and it worked well \u2013 although had to wait for the Monorail for 15 min. Still didn\u2019t see many taxis passing by the queue during that time\u2026 Have been in this park twice and would definitely go again. Good fun for adults as well!"

Again very well organised and very helpful staff at the ticket kiosk and even better !! discount as a resident of Dubai !! Very good locker system in place. The rides were out of this world and only one down side was the fact that all the rides from Neptunes Tower lead you back into the lazy river which after a while gets a bit monotonous. Posiden tower are where the real adrenaline rides are and a must is the posidens revenge but not for those of a heart condition !! Thoroughly enjoyed the day and even the lunch at Sharkbites restaurant was very good value for money. Be sure to keep your wrist band on if you have parked as this ensures you get the free parking.

A very good idea is to bring a lycra t-shirt or anykind of shirt to protect your skin in the individual slides (whith no tube). Otherwise the skin on your back will be bruised preety good. Almost everybody had red bruises on their backs. I think that happens due to the crazy speeds on those slides, but maybe some work could be done to try to solve this problem! The worst part by far was the food!! we ate at Shark Bites and it was by far the worst meal of the entire 1 week vacation!! It's a Burger King or McDonalds style fast-food, only with mutch worse food and at least 3 times more expensive. If you can, avoid eating inside the park!

So much to do we never got bored of it. The lazy river ride was so chilled and fun you could soak up sun rays while keeping cool.They have shallow pools where you could lie in and sunbath and keep cool. Amazing place......The rides were first class from kids rides to really scary for the brave!!!! Each day the family got bravier and on the last day we did just the hard core rides. It's fit for all age groups and you could be involved as much or as little as needed. I think our holiday was enhanced by this water park. In the hot days you were comfortable and did not burn. We loved it and say it was a first class attraction and will be coming back. And last of all the staff are wonderful and made the place safe!!"

Very beautiful, clean and big location so it's better to arrive early at the morning (the sun goes down about 5 pm in november) to have time to see the entire park, try all the crazy tubes, but also the beaches ant the dolphin bay. You'll find a lot of restaurant and coffee place to have lunch (if you don't want to spend a lot i recomand you the local fast food, food is good, specialy the falafel and the chicken).For the dolphin bay you have to order online your swim a couple of weeks before, it's expensive but it's a realy great experience, as for adults than children.When the park close you'll see a very big quew for taxi, so it's better to have dinner there and ask for taxi later, when they will be available again."

I recommend the aquapark from the palm, but don't go in the weekend (Friday and Saturday) because it will be a little crowded. Also try to go early in the morning and bring a towel with you because otherwise you have to pay in order to get one. You can bring 1 liter of water per person.I tried every ride and the coolest one is the leap of faith, you have to try it, even in you're a girl/woman :)We didn't choose to buy the tickets using an agency because it's too expensive. We arrived there using a taxi and buy the tickets from there. Be aware that at the exit there are lots of people waiting for the taxi, we were waiting for 1h, so I think it would be better to leave 30 min or so before closing."

I was no different.It was difficult to choose between Aquaventure or Wild Wadi. We chose aquaventure just for the sealife. There was marginal difference in prices and number of major rides.But I was disappointed as all I could see was a couple of ray fish in one of their best ride which has is a glass tube. The other rides were average - many of them similar except for their layout. Luckily there was relatively less rush that day so we were able to try out all the major rides from the 2 towers in about 3-4 hours and got out of the park.The ticket costs are higher than its worth. At least they should include a small locker with every 2 tickets. Overall, I would suggest skipping it if you are visiting Dubai for 4-5 days. I felt the waterpark at Sentosa, Singapore to be much more fun and value for money - at least they have a small free snorkeling area filled with lots of fishes."

The tunnel is made entirely of glass and the water around it is filled with sharks and sting rays. So you literally pass though these magnificient creatures within the safety of a glass tube. Great stuff this.There are other play pools and a lazy river for the younger guys. Entrance to the waterpark is included if you happen to stay at Atlantis, and it's good to spend half a day to beat the heat.Locker facilities, changing rooms, washrooms etc make the stay comfortable."

Given that Atlantis had a competitor go before them, I would have thought that they would pay more attention to what they needed to live up to. Aquaventure doesn't have water sprayed on its pathways - too many people doing the hot sand hop, as it's most practical to go barefoot, but too hot to do so. The other drawback is no payment system to buy food & drink throughout the day. Wild Wadi has a wristband payment system which you settle up before you leave. At Aquaventure it's cash, which means returning to your locker to get cash when you want to buy something. Depending where you are in the park, that can mean a 10 minute walk, each way. Don't get me wrong, it's a great day out. The views from the high slide towers are amazing and the facilities very good, but once you've tried something better already a number of years ago, you wonder why they didn't spend the extra to keep up with the competition"

Once in the park each slide took approximately 50-60minutes to get on which is uncomfortable in a 36degree heat whilst carrying a double rubber ring!

You enter for free if your staying at the Atlantis Hotel. Which is great indeed. Great staff, great slides, awesome photos at exhalirating slides.

Not the only reason we stayed at Atlantis but knowing my 8 year old would want to go to the water park most days and we'd booked the dolphin encounter, the economics of that certainly played a part in our hotel decision. Easy entry for hotel guests too, jump on a golf buggy from the hotel pool down to the wrist band hut and job done. No queuing among the masses at the main entrance!The park itself is great, the water slides, rapids, lazy river all still good but the addition of the new area is very good. The big tyre rides were certainly popular and great funWe were there during half term so queues for rides were longer than previous visits.Two things that need some attention:1. The time it takes to get served and lunch food in the main food hall.....sooooo slow (and expensive)!2. The lack of shaded areas: With so many families with small children there aren't many shaded areas. We found a spot under the trees down by the beach but that got very busy by late morning.Very enjoyable, always go at least one day every visit to Dubai"

So we decided to reach the park by late afternoon, being well aware that we'll end up having just 2-3 hours to spend there. Bad decision, because we really wanted to spend more time there. There's a lot of rides to take, and other stuff to do. There are late evening beach side activities as well, but we had to miss those as my two boys were tired and sleepy and wanted to go back home.All in all, a great family fun day.Fridays are usually super busy there, so you may have to wait a bit for most rides. That's the only drawback. Again, a great place for kids, modern rides, some really fast and adrenaline-pumping ones for grown-ups, a lot of emphasis on safety, cleanliness all around, good food on the complimentary vouchers that we got as part of the promotion.Must visit at least once.

Queues to collected pre booked tickets were as long as on the day tickets which made me feel I had wasted time pre booking. We arrived early at about 10.30am and were definitely better off doing this. We found sun beds easily to pop our towels on and also shared a locker since there were only 2 of us. The lockers are run on a barcode system where you have a wristband with your code on. This is in addition to your entrance wristband and photo wristband- it was a good job I was not adverse to them!! We started off on the lazy river- you need to collect a plastic ring (single or double- to go on some ride and float around the river. I recommend you arrive early as later in the day people were struggling to find the rings although there were plenty if you went further into the park. The first Aztec style pyramid is home to 8 water slides including the Leap of Faith which drops you vertically from great heights before plunging you through a fish tank. Queues built as the day went on so do it early. The other rides required a ring and some were accessed via a conveyer belt from the lazy river. The second pyramid was brand new- you did not need a rubber ring for these. 2 rides were a body flume experience- nothing special and a ridiculous queue. Think it was called Slitheren- I would call it don't bother-in. There were also 2 slides which involved you sitting in a raft for 6 people and then plunged down a slope with the finish being you riding up the other side- great fun. The final piste de resistance is Poisidon's Revenge. You were loaded into a coffin shaped module at the top of the pyramid and a glass door is closed on you. You are then counted down before being plunged downwards (I won't ruin the surprise). Food outlets are typically fats food but OK and portions are large. Fab day out for all the family!!"

There aren't many sun beds so most guests end up on the beach. The rides aren't fantastic and as I heard one gentleman say 'long queues and no thrill' sums up most rides. It's something different to do in Dubai, but considering the reviews I read on here, it left me feeling a little disappointed. It's also quite a trek to get to, if you're not staying on the palm as the monorail is not well supported by other modes of transport and taxis are likely to become stuck in traffic."

I have to say it was a good way of setting up our day, but we had to squeeze in lunch a bit in a hurry to make it back to the hotel on time, around 3pm. Had a lot of fun at Aquaventure. Arrived around 10:30 and there was already some movement to buy tickets so we only got in around 11am. Perhaps getting there a bit earlier before opening time would be better. A lot of rides can be enjoyed in couple, so that's nice. Make sure to check out the beach and some rides that are a bit further away, otherwise you might miss half the park. If you own a GoPro, take it with you and make great videos while enjoying the park. The ride we liked the most was Shark Attack! in the Tower of Neptune, where you get to go through a transparent tube at the end, and see the sharks and rays swimming around you, it is really awesome!"

The hotel offers free valet packing for the water park, but it fills up fast. We got there at 10 am and it was already full, so we had to park in the parking lot, which is quite far away and then wait for the bus. The queue took more than an hour to buy tickets as no one seemed to be in a hurry. It was a weekday and we were early so the crowd wasn't unbearable yet. This is where we got scammed. Instead of the resident passes we normally buy, we were told we had to buy a package deal which included lunch and the Lost Chambers. Being a resident, I had already been to the Lost Chamber twice, so this was a waste. The prices for food inside the park are high, so I reluctantly bought the tickets. We'd already lost two hours, so it was too late to back out now. We did manage to find tubes and a sun-bed easily as it was quite early. The queues for rides also were not bad yet. Everything was working except for something called the Aquaconda. I will say that Poseidon's Revenge is not for the faint of heart. It's basically a 4 meter straight drop. After being there about two hours, I managed to lose my glasses in the Rapids. The staff were not very helpful on this account and pretty much directed me to Lost & Found. I thankfully had a spare pair with me, and checked Lost & Found throughout the day to no avail. Next came the adventure for lunch. I took our voucher to the restaurant near our sun-bed, to which I was then told it could only be redeemed at one restaurant. That restaurant ended up being on the other side of the park, and had over 300 people in queue. Basically they forced everyone to buy vouchers for one restaurant, then failed to adequately staff the restaurant for the massive amount of people who would then come to redeem said voucher. Very bad planning. So we waited close to an hour for a burger. They were out of condiments, so it was a dry burger. Great value for money right there. We stayed and rode rides until dusk. Then went to lost & found one last time, and left my number. I no more than got off the palm, when they called me. My glasses had been found and were surprisingly not damaged in any way. Most likely someone from the staff found them, and kept them on their person until the end of the shift. They were quite expensive, so I was just glad to get them back. Overall, this wasn't my best trip to Aquaventure. The mandatory meal tickets were a real money scam to take advantage of the spring rush. I can't believe they force even residents to buy them."

We therefore proceeded to Shawarma ride another 45 minute wait due to two delays. Coupled with the chaotic scenes in the barracuda restaurant I will avoid Aquaventure until the summer months.

We visited AV in half term so expected it to be a little busy but surely so did the park.We arrived at Atlantis at about 10.15 to find a booking hall in absolute chaos with several different queues for different windows. We'd booked online so expected to get in fairly quickly...wrong!It took us an hour to get our wrist bands, much of which was spent fending off Russian queue jumping families with no help from the staff who caved in when challenged and let them use the wrong queue bypassing those of us who had followed their instructions 30 minutes before. It got quite heated when one guy challenged one such bloke who had weaved through the queue.There were at least 4 windows unmanned so questions must be asked regarding the staffing levels by Atlantis.That started us off on a bad footing but It didn't get much better inside the park, we only managed 4 slides in the 2 hours before lunch. Unfortunately one of the queue jumping families ended up in the same area as us during our lunch break. They took one of their kids for a wee in the bush behind another families sunbeds rather than walk 50m to the toilets!!!Sunbeds were in fairly short supply, we ended up sharing ours with two other families who had hijacked them whilst we were on a nearby slide. I guess if you are intending to spend most of the day sliding then you shouldn't really reserve a sunbed but the lockers were quite a walk away from the main slides.The slides themselves were good but you have to take your own tubes up the stairs unlike wild wadi where machines took them up for you. You carry your tube around with you and most of the time there are spares floating around the lazy river. Compared to Wild Wadi I didn't rate Aquaventure at all. The queues were bigger, the slides were about the same, the staff weren't quite as friendly as WW but the biggest difference were the clientele. For some reason Aquaventure attracts high numbers of ignorant idiots."

My daughter had an absolute ball!All in all we had a great day and would gladly come back.Just a couple of suggestions to help improve the park. Instead of making people carry money or credit card, they should use the same system as Wild Wadi where you have a wristband with a chip that allows you pay for food and drink. You then pay everything upon leaving the park. They should consider hosing down the paths to keep them cool. It is often extremely hot and you risk burning your feet walking from one place to another. It is a bit of an inconvenience having to leave your flip flops around the park as you might get on a ride at one point in the park and get off another."

After queuing for tickets for 45 minutes we gained entry to the park and managed to get our first ride on the Rapids which frequently became 'log jammed'. Another wait of over half an hour and we had our 2nd ride on Shark Attack. Other rides also had huge queues so we made our way to Splashers, the children's area, which was also crowded. There was nowhere for us to sit and fully clothed adults were sitting in groups in the water, we even saw one man washing his ears out and showering under the water which had a strong uric smell. We then queued at the nearest outlet for lunch only to be told they had stopped serving pizzas and could only offer burgers. The next closest food outlet had no tables or chairs free. The toilets were awash with 'water' and the smell was revolting, overflowing bins and dirty sinks. Poseidon's revenge was a hopeless attempt - over 200 people waiting so at 4.00 we realised it was hopeless trying to get further rides and left. The park could not cope with the volume of people and we felt quite cheated at having paid so much money to simply queue and will be making our views known to the management. We frequently visit Dubai and enjoy the first class customer service it has always offered but this experience was dreadful. Aquaventure is over run, over priced and over rated and should be avoided. For a fun filled family day out Wild Wadi is much much better."

When you arrive you need to figure out the best package for your group. We wanted to do the water park and the aquarium. They do provide a combo package for this but we also wanted the package to include a locker, towel and a meal but ithat is not provided as a combo deal with the aquarium. So we ended up with a gold deal and bolted on the aquarium. Sounds simple but the last thing you want to do on a day out is maths.When you pay you get a wrist band with a bar code on to use this to open your locker - so far so good, but then they give a paper receipt for the aquarium another for your towels and another for your food deal. Why can't all this information be added to your wrist band bar code? Then to add to this madness as you go on the slides they give you a another bar code wrist band for finding your photos - why not use the first one? So three bits of paper and two wrist bands and off we go and we loved it. It was a busy day so we had to queue a bit this is understandable but at other parks they use entertainers to distract you. The life guards staff were plentiful, happy and fun. We had arrived by taxi which was easy but when we left to go home the queue was very, very long so we decided to get the monorail to the mainland assuming that we could hook up with taxi, bus or the metro from that end. But at the end of the monorail there was absolutely nothing! We ended up walking to the marina area on the side of a busy road until we eventually found a taxi. (A suggestion would be a shuttle bus to the marina metro stop). In short the product of the water park and aquarium were excellent but the end to end experience needs some work."

So I only got a couple of hours at Aquaventure, which I regret. Still, just means I'll have to go back! We did take my four-year-old to the kids play area, which was really well set up, but he was a bit scared of the big buckets of water that filled up and then tipped (with little notice) lots of water down on top of anyone who was underneath. Unfortunately, we were unprepared when we first arrived in the kitchen area, so he got a terrible shock when the smaller of the two buckets of water tipped up right on top of him, so it was hard to get him to do much else in that area afterwards. However, for a child that is less timid, I would definitely recommend it! There is so much to do there, for all ages, that I would recommend getting there early in the morning when it opens because you could spend a whole day there easily, and that's what I'll be doing next time!There was also a strong presence of staff (i.e. lifeguards) so my family and I always felt very safe."

However, be aware that the locker is assigned to one of the barcodes on the wrist, so if sharing that person will always need to go back to the locker to open it. Not a problem for us but for some it might be. Excellent facilities, plenty of sun beds and places to eat. The food at the waterpark is quite expensive, as are the drinks, so take some snacks/drinks along. There is an option to go on the zip wire, if you pay the front desk it is 75 dirhams, but if you pay at the beach it is 100 dirhams! This is for unlimited use all day and each section is about 50 metres. It is not vast or particularly challenging but something else to do."

Be there early in the morning as the crowd starts to swell in the afternoon.the fee is 220 drms during weekdays plus locker rental of 40, during payment ask the cashier to deposit 100 dirhams (atleast for one person) into your waterpark bracelet. The bracelet had a barcode that stores the information on how much you deposit. the deposit can latter be used inside the park for any purchases of food or souvenirs, no need to keep wallet or paper money when moving around the park. Unused money will be refunded.The only downside of this waterpark is there is only one changing room, as the park closes at 6 PM, the one and only changing room is packed of people all lining up for shower. I wish there could have been more changing room..."

There are tons of things to do and we literally spent the whole day trying new tubes and activities. Couple things to keep in mind: 1) buy your tickets online. That way you won't have to spend an hour standing in the line and you will even save some money (tickets are cheaper online). 2) Have a big breakfast because the food inside the park in really expensive. The good thing is that you can leave the park and come back as long as you keep the bracelet. And finally, 3) stay away from the water at the beach. My fiance and I got stung by a jellyfish pretty bad. Luckily the lifeguard had vinegar and a medic came right away with a relief cream a after a couple hours the pain was gone."

We paid 285 Dirhams p/p at the door & an additional 40 Dirhams for a locker.There is an additional charge for beach towels so take your own to save on this & they allow 1 litre water to be taken in per person.

The rides are great and full of thrill and it is quite easy to get to places as they are clearly marked. Only thing is that if you go in the summer, make sure you have alot of sun screen on you because otherwise you are going to burn yourself with in the first hour or so.

Although I explained everything to the security guy at the stairs that lead up to the Lobby, he jelled at me that this is not possible at all.

I highly recommend this place for family and circle of friends. It's definitely worth every penny! :D A lifetime experience!"

The lazy river was among the better ones I have floated, especially the rapids sections that were fun but not dangerous in any way. Definitely get there early enough to get you seats or cabana, and be ready to commit a day. Park pictures are as expensive as you'd expect. I'd suggest to the park to create more directional signage around the park, and to make the entry process easier. As well, allow pictures to be purchased online, as we saw some of our photos but missed some important ones because a wrist band was not scanned while others were. Additionally, maybe eliminate the multiple wrist bans in favor of a single one to scan everything from. A nice thing to do in Dubai, but you may consider other parks as well."

Whereas Wild Wadi is designed so that you do not spend much time out of the water, Aquaventure is unfortunately designed in such a way that after almost every ride one has to climb the same tower or or go along the same route to get to another ride. I think this is one of the major things that lets the park down.In addition, the flooring can get extremely hot during the day and is a nightmare to walk on barefoot. Almost everyone had trouble walking in certain parts of the park and as a waterpark, it is not practical to have footwear on at all times.Furthermore, entry is expensive compared to Wild Wadi and I do not think the rides make up for it. As such, if you had to choose, go to Wild Wadi for an all round better experience."

We didn't realise at the time, but you can access the waterpark directly through The Avenues. We spent money on a locker which is 40Ed, but in hindsight I wouldn't do this again as we didn't need anything!! As we arrived so early, there was no queues for any rides. We managed to do all rides in 2 1/2 hours. Including a long lazy ride in the lazy river.The lazy river all flows into a few rides, so you can do a few rides without leaving your ring! As we let at half 12, the queues for outsiders coming in was manic. We didn't get a bed, or anything, and after we did the slides we just went back to the hotel pools. Leap of faith is scary to initially go down, but super fun when you take the plunge. The poseidens revenge was very fast and fun. Would recommend to visit"

Hence it was indeed some experience switching from taxi to metro to taxi to monorail. It was worth the experience though. The park is really huge with lot of rides. I loved the leap of faith!! However the fairytale ends here. Most of the rides were replica of ones in other countries, or rather they have adapted these rides from here. The rapids and torrents were good. So was the food, although quite costly but nonetheless worth the money spent. We went there on Tuesday hence didn't experience long queues. There are plenty of lifeguards and water park staff to take care of you and help you out. Might not come here again But the journey to Atlantis was amazing."

There are a fair few that is decent fun.BUT, there is NO place to cool down. The water is too hot, everywhere. No single place to get a cooldown. Very disappointing.And here is the best tip for the day out. Either book a taxi, or a private \"limousin\" to pick you up after when you're finished. You won't believe how long the queues were in the afternoon. We spent 2 hrs!! And the Metro-station is NOT connected to the city-Metro, it's just an attraction on the island.You can't bring your own food, and the food is ridiculously priced. 40 AED for 4 small bottles of water is the best buy...The lockers are really small as well, so beware - you won't get all the family stuff in 1 locker...Also, bring footwear, because the ground is SO hot, you can't walk around in the park without any footwear."

I thought it was fabulous lots to do, dissapointed there wasn't a wave pool, I can understand why there was a beach, but we didn't use it as we have our own private hotel beach but great if your staying in the city, you could spend every day of your holiday in here. We used our entertainer voucher so saved lots of money on entrance and locker towel combo. Food is not as bad as I thought and have read, it's just the same as any theme park you go to, you pay extra, but hey your at the Palm and the prices are good. I could have got burger fries and drink in with my locker combo, but don't eat that type of food. I got a lovely icream 3.00 pound. The views are to kill for here, you are in paradise. Watch out for the lazy river rides you can end up on a bigger ride than you expect. It's worth going early and go on a Wednesday 10am no queues the pick of a sunbed, turn up at 1 or 2pm and you won't get a sun lounger, and really need one of these to have a break. Make sure you have flip flops, I got myself some beach shoes to go into the water and you don't have to take them off and leave them, the floor is really hot. you don't need a locker your stuff will be ok on your sun lounger. Best thing about getting there early, no que on entry. A good tip for taxis, we got a taxi there it cost 4.00 pound, we came out of the park and only hotel cars were there with people trying to get you into there cars which cost a lot more, 5 times more !!!!!! Walk past them onto the road turn left 100 yards up the road will be you regular taxis. Worth doing. Photos!!!!!!!! A lot of photos are taken of you as you enjoy your day be warned they are very expensive. Have fun. "

We had decided not to book our tickets in advance and were glad we hadn't since we could buy a combo package at the gate which included a locker and towel at a discounted price. I had been apprehensive about using the lockers having read a previous review here which stated that they opened spontaneously and people came back to find their belongings gone. I suspect this was actually due to the slightly confusing symbols on the confirmation screen when returning to your locker. A tick represents 'end my locker session' while a cross means 'continue using locker'. The rides are varied and the majority come with in-ride photo opportunities (photos can be purchased outside the aquarium). The lazy river/rapids has many points to get on and off and allows you to go around and many times as you want. Shark Attack! was a particular favorite since the ride include a leisurely trip through the middle of a shark tank. There is also a great water play area for children.If you're going in summer you will definitely need footwear of some kind. The ground quickly becomes too hot to walk on. Flip-flops can be left at the entrance to each ride (so don't worry about carrying them on with you) but even the short walk back to retreive them was unbearably painful when walking on ground that had been in the sun.We took a break from the rides to go down to the private beach. If you choose to go into the sea beware since there are (non-deadly) jellyfish (and probably other creatures) but no signs to warn you of this. Having grown up near the sea I slowly waded in and didn't kick up sediment so that I could keep an eye on what was around me. This let me see the fish (and a jellyfish) which was an amazing experience. Another family chose to swim right in though and one of them ended up getting stung (a lifeguard called the paramedics) so beware if you choose to go in."

You have to pay extra for a small locker and towels, 80 aed (16\u20ac). In September there were no ques. Beverages and food is rather expencive.

The lazy river kept us mused for almost an hour then the various slide rides added some adrenaline filled fun moments. The leap of faith is exhilarating, in particular the first few seconds of free falling. Let's of food places. Only negative is the extra hidden costs of obvious things like lockers and towels. Increase the price and make them free. \u00a310 for a locker and \u00a35 for a towel. Yet only \u00a340 entry. This means in reality \u00a360 per adult all in before food and drink.But that is not the way of the Atlantis...make it look cheaper than it is and make sure that we rinse every penny out of everyone is the strategy!"

The waterpark was clean with so much to do and the lazy river/rapids went on forever. Waterpark has it's own beautiful beach to chill out on too. Don't forget flip flops though as the floor gets so hot and will burn your feet!! We went in September and it wasn't as busy as I would of expected which was nice as didn't really need to queue for anything for long.....except to get in as we had prebooked our tickets but were directed to the wrong queue. Highly recommend."

The park itself is very clean and well maintained with beautiful flowers, palm trees etc. everywhere you look. The water rides are varied from lazy river rides to hair-raising rapids. These rapids are extremely fast flowing, and I personally have never been so scared or screamed so much in my life, but boy was it exhilarating!!!!!!!!!!!! You can step of at any point once you have reached a lagoon, then join somewhere else along the way. A bit disappointed in the food on offer. Quite pricey for basic things like sausage or burger and chips. The beach itself is lovely and very clean. It has plenty of sunbeds complete with the all important shades attached. Across the water you can see the fantastic, modern Dubai architecture. Although we enjoyed our day spent there, I am not sure about returning next year. We still have plenty of new places to explore and a couple of return visits to favourites."

Having seen online a 3 in 1 promotion \u2018for summer\u2019 on their website I booked this is advance (on 7 July) for the two of us. The promotion included lunch and entry to Lost Chambers. There was no mention of when the promotion ended. On arrival what was billed as a separate checkout for those who purchased online turned out to be long queue with 2 counters \u2013 so nothing special really. But the ticket clerk only gave us entry to the water park and when informed her we had purchased the promotion she said saying the offer had finished. We pointed out that the offer was still being advertised at the airport the day before. After she refused to entertain our comments we asked for a manager who told us the offer expired on 23 July. Again we pointed out that it was still being advertised at the airport and that the promotion was for summer and summer did not end on 23 July. We insisted on them meeting their obligation and eventually the manager agreed and we got our tags. This took several minutes of arguing to the frustration of those in the queue. You can rent a locker and towels here.Eventually we gained entry. The locker room and shower area were nice and clean. The park itself is big and the water rides are relaxing as well as heart in your mouth stuff \u2013 just like most other decent water parks in the world. Just take your pick. The special feature here is the water slide through the aquarium which was really special though very brief.There are several negatives. The biggest let down was signage which was minimal and often just disappears leaving you in limbo in the heat. Another was having to carry your tubes \u2013 whoever came up with that idea - even up the stairs? No shade to relax and unusually for a water park no waves! The \u2018beach\u2019 was no better with water slimy colour.Overall, this was a disappointing trip especially considering the high price charged. Would not go there again, wild wadi is better value for money in my view."

This September we returned to The park is bigger than 2 years ago, because a new tower (Tower of Posseidon) has been built. There are some new slides, which are amazing and thrilling. You must ride them. There are two capsules, while you're standing in the capsule, the floor will be removed and you will be falling into the deep. There are two big slides, which you can ride at least 3 of us (max 6 people). Screaming and fun are guaranteed :)The park is absolutely clean, you can find many restaurants, cafes, bars, where you can grab a glass of Coke, for example. There are a load of sun beds and umbrellas, you are given complementary towels, you do not have to pay for them. Moreover, you don't have to worry that you won't find a free sun bed.There are rapids and lazy rivers, which touch all the parts of the park. The 'old' part of the park is connected to the new tower, which is cool.There is a huge playing area for kids, all ages can find what fit for them the best.If you stay at Atlantis, you can enter the park everyday for free of charge. You can charge everything (drink, food, etc.) to your room.If your accommodation is with half-board, you can use your half-board voucher at Aquaventure, as well.I was highly satisfied with the park, even my Dad (65) enjoyed all the thrilling new rides :)"

My husband and I stayed at the Atlantis Dubai as a stopover on our way home to Sydney in September 2014, and as a part of staying in the hotel we had unlimited entry into Aqua Adventure Park. It wasn't ridiculously busy the day we went I think it was a Wednesday, however it was 45 degrees outside so you could imagine the heat and humidity. We went from about 11am until around 4pm but in the whole time being there we were doing something different. This is an amazing place to take a family or just a group of friends or even a couple. The rides are state of the art, and the staff are happy to help with anything. There were rides for children and hen others for adults, my favourite were probably the Leap of Faith and Slitherins revenge. There is also an amazing rapids torrent and then a seperate torrent for just relaxing. There is a seperate area just for kids with a water playground and small wading pool. There are towels available for hire so you don't need to take your own, large families can hire cabanas and there are plenty of beach chairs available. I would recommend anybody going to dubai to check it out as it is a good way to keep cool and have some fun at the same time.Just a few tips:- it is very hot in the park and not ridiculous amounts of shade. So hat, sunnies, rash shirts, sunblock and water are a must. - you can wear bikinis etc etc in the park they don't have cover up rules so you are able to wear your normal bikinis.- if you can get things or shoes that you can go around the park in they are very useful as the ground is soo hot it burns your feet running from ride to ride.- there are a few rides that will take you back up the mountains so you don't have to climb every time, keep an eye out for them.

I was a bit weary of taking my 2 young children into this water park (2 & 3 years old). I emailed Atlantis a month before to ask about height restrictions, life vests, age requirements for the rapids & didn't get a response. We were guests of Atlantis so had free access anyway. This is such a fabulous water park. It still feels new even though its going on 5 years now. Its clean, the water is crystal clear, the staff are friendly & you feel safe. There were double doughnuts with a blocked in bottom as a child seat that my husband & I could easily take 1 child each & float around in knowing they were safe. The torrents & rapids were safe for the littles but the rides had a height requirement of 1.2m so my 2 were not tall enough. Understandable.The childrens play area is marvellous & there was plenty of life guards to pluck a child out of the water at the end of a slide when they come down a bit fast. It was also a great shaded area to sit in the water & watch your little one play. Much much MUCH better then Wild Wadi (which ive also reviewed).There are plenty of life vests which my 2 didn't end up wearing as they weren't needed. Locker hire is AED40/day even for resort guests and everything is done with wristbands so no cash needed. Ice creams and any food is expensive, I did take some snacks & left them in the locker as the change rooms are air conditioned. The new rides, Tower of Posiedon, are excellent but not child friendly. Wear a hat/sunnies & cover up, use loads of suncream & enjoy."

Get here around then because we beat everybody and were able to go on all of the main water slides at least twice each.. Without having to wait in a queue. Especially good for the slide where you slide through the tank of fish... Because the queue was huge by 1pm.The lagoon and rapids combo is very good. Even better so that you can queue for rides while still floating around in your tube. Innovative, perfect for somebody like me who wanted to relax but not miss out on the rides. The change rooms were always clean and felt safe. Hair dryers are provided. Only thing is that lockers are in change rooms, so if your visiting with a different gender then you won't be able to access your things if you have given them the locker pass. Alternatively you can each get a locker, but for the expensive entry price we didnt want to spend anymore money. So we stuck with one locker. It's manageable but a little annoying."

It was lovely and quiet when we went, kids going back to school and all that. So the best thing was the variety and quality of the rides.I think there are a couple of things though that Wild Wadi does a bit better. No one offered us a map on entry. The rides aren't all linked together so it's not very intuitive to find your way around....I went back and asked for a map which helped,but you do need to ask. Also if you go I recommend you wear some nylon board socks or something like that. They don't spray water on the floors and there is no where to put your flip flops so your feet roast trying to get from one place to the other....really impractical.It was very clean but also very expensive, the staff aren't as customer focused as at Wild Wadi either.Overall it's a good few hours out."

I knew it would be very hot, having visited Dubai many times myself, but also knew that if you are sensible with the sun, you can still have a very good time. We stayed at the One and Only Palace of the Royal Mirage, and apart from it being my favourite hotel in Dubai, it also offers free tickets to Aquaventure! I had myself only ever visited Wild Wadi, which is also great fun, but now having visited Aquaventure..three days in a row, I personally prefer it. We liked the wave rides and low level rides, and also shark attack, but I would have liked a few signs to show the different levels of rides. Perhaps a few photos to show how daring or child suited etc. The ground is burning hot, so take flip flops or similar and be prepared for having to pay for lockers and towels with no money back. You pay, not rent. My advice, take a waterproof wallet for around your neck to put some cash and a credit card for safekeeping. Travel to the park with a small rucksack full of non valuable essentials, sun cream factor 50 for August, and then find a sun lounger, (there are hundreds), pop it under the sun lounger along with your flip flops and jump straight in the water for the day! We did the locker and towel thing on day one, then realised what others do on day two and went from there as just explained. We went from 10.30 -6.00 each day, kept applying sun cream all day, drank tons of water available from many outlets around the park, did not burn or get sunstroke and had the absolute time of our lives. A lot of people have written about burnt feet. It's easy, just don't forget your flip flops! Food outlets are below average, so we actually didn't bother and just had a big breakfast, then drank water all day and had a big dinner later. Staff were all friendly and helpful, and on day two my polo cap flew off on shark attack and I lost it. On day three I went to lost property and could not believe they had it!Shark attack is a ride which you climb a lot of stairs to get to the top..so don't forget your flip flops, then you ride on either a single rubber ring, or in our case a double one. It's a big drop, then a dark tunnel ride, and at the end you come out in a see through tube through the centre of a tank full of sharks. Great fun. We clearly enjoyed Aquaventure as we went three days in a row, although had we not had the free tickets from our hotel, we would have only gone the once."

The quality of ice cream is low.The attractions are all good and we appreciated the new multi person buoy rides.The staff around and along the water attractions are very attentive and serious in what they do and we were happy that security seems to be a number one priority.

All the staff are very friendly and they interact with you at every opportunity. We paid extra for the zip-lines both days and got on quite good terms with the staff there, as most were the same ones both days. The admissions staff were really helpful too - we visited on consecutive days, but forgot to buy our return ticket for day 2 as we exited on day 1 (there is a discount). Returned the next day with our admission wristbands from the previous day and it was no problem for a manager to give us the discounted rate. If visiting when it is really hot in Dubai, make sure you take footwear of some kind you can wear / take into the water with you. The paths / walkways get VERY hot in the sunshine - the stage where is is uncomfortable to walk on them. Some of them have water sprinklers on them to help keep them cool, but when it is 43C in the shade... you need something on your feet. If you do the zip-lines, you definitely need footwear, as the launch / landing platforms there get very hot. The lockers are similar sizes to the waterparks in Florida (so a bit small - but ram stuff in and lock the door!) They are, however, located in the locker rooms, so if you visit as a couple, you'll need a locker each to make things easier."

Worse was to come was getting stuck in the Poseidon's revenge slide, my fault apparently as I unfolded my arms but absolutely terrifying to be in an enclosed space with no help shouted down, luckily there was a hole to climb out of, the attitude of the staff was awful and the offer to give it another go was declined.

Staff here are brilliant, happy to help but also have a fab sense of humour going around the rides especially around the lazy river/rapids. You can purchase photos for rides/rapids although be warned when we had our wrist band scanned at the end of our day the photo wasn't of us and this was made out to be our fault, the guy had a right strop when we asked him to find our photos - not exactly our fault and they should appreciate the business for the amount they charge for photos!! Regardless of his huffing and puffing we demanded them anyway- these were a memory for us that we wanted to keep. Last time i enjoyed the dolphin experience, this time the sea lion experience. Another faultless fantastic experience which i thoroughly enjoyed. My partner was able to take pictures as well which were lovely to add to the collection as well as purchasing a USB with the professional photos taken during the activity.

There are lifeguards everywhere and there's plenty of things to do for all ages. Whether you like a lazy swim or something more adrenaline rushed, you'll find it at Aquaventure. Residents of Atlantis get complimentary admission and can get in before the general public which is great for avoiding any queues. We didn't have to queue for anything as we went in the morning, but we noticed that the rides were much busier in the afternoon. Get there for 9.45 to beat the rush! If you want to scare yourself witless, do the Leap of Faith and Poseidon's Revenge rides!!!! If you dare!"

Very costly considering I was only there for a short time but being a Tuesday there was short wait times for each slide. Facilities were well kept and better than any of the Australian water theme parks I was use to. Pity the sharks are all so small! Bigger ones would make it more exciting! Definitely a place for kids more so than young adults but fun can still be had. Expect theme park priced drinks and food. It's always the way at these places."

I had been to Wild Wadi before and had high expectations for Atlantis. What a let down! The rides do not out do Wild Wadi, unlike WW the lazy river only offers 3 rides. In WW you seem to go on forever going down alternative routes. The Shark Tunnel is a flop. Inside the tube you cannot see the fish very well and it's a very short part of the ride. The signage is almost nil! The rides are not marked to identify how extreme they are. It's difficult to get around, offend ending up in dead ends. You have to carry your tubes everywhere, even clubbing up flights of steps, many flights of steps unlike WW which colour codes rides and has tubes waiting for you.There is no wave machine, no surfing, NO SHADE. Yes it's expensive and to swim with dolphins and string rays it's another \u00a320 or so extra on top of the \u00a340- \u00a350 entrance fee dependent on where you buy them. Lockers are another \u00a38.00. Water is \u00a32.40 which is cheaper than the hotels but expense when you do need to keep topping your intake up due to the heat. Staff are very good in the park but on entry, We had to queue with our fast track tickets. We were not told you can put money on your wrist band, thank god I knew this as others were walking around with money. Flip flops are a problem. In WW you leave them at certain points, here no such points are provided and you certainly cannot go bear foot without a visit to the burns unit.I have also been turned off staying at the Palm Hotel. Yes it attracts people of wealth who use the park free of charge however many of them seem to have left their manners at home treating other guests as second rate. I have not experienced this in other places in Dubai and if I come back would rather stay at the Royal Meriden that I cannot fault, it's excellent.In all, so disappointed and no match for WW."

The rides were great ! I love shark attack because it was mild attraction, not too steep slide, but the interesting part was when you were out of the slide, at the end of it you were in the tube made of glasses which is located inside the big aquarium where sharks swam around. So you can see the sharks so close while you were also wet in the water. What a feeling.... Anyway, since it was July, it was very hot, we could not stand it for more than 2 hours playing outdoor and we needed lots and lots of water. The drink sold there in the water park was quite expensive, but gladly we stayed there and the hotel was very generous about water bottle. We could have as many as we needed. Simply recommended if you visited Dubai especially when you traveled with kids."

This was a father & son trip (my son is 10) and I was told that the park is primarily for kids and not much for Adults so I wasnt really looking forward to it (as we've frequented Wild Wadi a Lot, and that has many thrill rides). In camparisons to wild wadi the changing rooms are top-class with great shower facilities. However, please don't try to do this park without slipers ... its is VERY spread out, and the walkway stone are HOT!!! To my suprise there were a lot of thrills here, specially the newer section made at the further end of the park. In fact some group tube rides were way too scary! . . . there was also amazing zip lines across the park. For me one of the highlights was access to the palm cresent beach thats something that's not offered at Wild Wadi The downside was that the childrens park slides are right at the entrance and quite away from the adult rides, so you they both feel cut off from each other. The other strange thing was that the tube to ride on were not near the slide (one had to go to the wave pool, pick it up and take it to the slides....and everyone became very possesive of their own tubes).They have some great combo deals of tickets and meals (I strongly advise taking them as they are great value). The restaurants are at the last section of the park ... so its a bit of a walk, but its quite peaceful once you get there.Me and My Son Loved the park... will definately go again"

Last year a completely new tower was being build, adding slides to the park similar to those of its competitors. With a general admission ticket of around 50 euros, it is priced similarly to other big water parks in the area. Food and snacks is reasonably priced. There are rides and slides for all the family. Adrenaline seekers, or not. They will not allow any food or drinks when entering the park. Towels are not available for free, you get one only if you rent it. Be careful when buying other stuff, like sunglasses, accessories, sun creams, etc. A sun spray priced at DHS 50 at a local supermarket, was DHS 115 at a shop in the park.If you visit Dubai for your vacation, it is an attraction you have to see."

We dropped our iphone and amazing enough it never turned up, I know this park is open to the public and I don't blame the Atlantis but if Dubai did stick to the laws and punish a lot more tourists then we could of got our phone back.We also lost a pair of designer sunglasses in the torrents and never saw them again either, when you do go to lost and found they seem to have a lot of cheaper sunglasses or fakes but people don't seem to want to give you back the more expensive items, again more strict laws for tourists in the parks."

Over all the water park was fun and the the rides were really good. Only bad experience was in the end due to the lockers. As you see Aqua venture authorities paste a plastic strap on your wrist which is your ticket and locker key also(which is good and doesn't fall off). You have to scan it on a reader which opens up a locker for you to keep your belongings. At the end of my tour, when i came back and scanned my strap on the locker, it opened up a new locker for me instead of my old one. I was very sure which was one was my locker so I started to look for security staff. That's where the bad experience started,no security staff was present near the lockers room, had to ask the main gate security man to call some one towards lockers. took them 20 minutes to come and they started asking me questions about what was in the locker and my details. After writing down everything , he put in his master codes and inside i looked and was What the F..... someone else's stuff was inside it and my stuff was gone. My 400 Dirhams, Hotel room card, mobile, sunglasses, digital camera, and clothes all were gone. The security man said to me we have to go to Lost and found now. I hadn't bring passports or more money and left at my hotel but was still in shock over my stolen items. The security guy escorted me to the lost and found stand where another guy started taking my details. He asked to show something to prove my identity to which i told everything was in locker and i dont have any thing on me. Now he I told him the main thing is my hotel card on which my name is written and other stuff exact details also. But he kept on asking like any friend or reference in Dubai who can confirm my identity. At this point i started to get frustrated and got in a little argument with him and had to ultimately say sorry as he was the only person who could help me get my stuff back. After finally writing down my details and signing an official paper, he handed a big plastic bag to me . I opened it and all my stuff was inside it. All this process took 1 hour and another security guy told me that this type of incident occurs daily. I wonder why Aqua venture is having lockers at all if people are getting these issues on daily basis. How can my locker be assigned to some one else and my stuff end up in lost and found."

The Aquaventure Waterpark is located in The Atlantis Hotel on Palm Island in Jumeirah - it is about 30 mins drive from Downtown Dubai (will cost you around AED 50 for one time trip). The hotel has a fantastic location, located right up at the end of the Palm Island. Travelling to the hotel is pretty easy, as there is a metro train that connects Dubai to the park. We took a train from Business Bay to the Dubai Internet City metro station - a minimum taxi fare will take you to the Palm Jumeirah Gateway monorail station which takes you to Aquaventure monorail station.The waterpark in itself is pretty average - some of the rides like the Poseiden's Revenge and Leap of Faith are fabulous. Most of the other rides are pretty much the same and will require a double tube (After a few rides, we were basically bored). A good experience to visit this park especially during summers. But please be aware that during summers the park is boiling at 45\u00b0C and it is pretty much advisable to carry slippers and sun lotion.A good place to visit since it offers a very different experience in the city of Dubai."

There are also several 'rivers' for floating around the park, which also include 'rapids' and 'torrents'. If you get a picture anywhere around the park and want it at the end of the day, don't pay the 85 DHS they initially ask you for, they'll go down to 50 (it's a bit of a fiddle the attendants can do) for just a print.

Great time in the water park go early especially in August hot, the park is only open to Atlantis guests from 10 am to 11 am so you can get all the cool rides before any queues, despite this I found the park to be quite quiet we stayed one day until 1 pm and no queues also going from 4 pm until it shut at about 7 pm meant you definitely didn't get burnt as the sun starts to go down at 4 pm."

            "review": "Excellent rides even in the desert heat!. Spent 2 days at the park with teen kids, while we stayed at the Atlantis. You don't get and early entry but staying next door to it makes it a lot easier, specially in summer. There is a direct covered indoor walkway from the hotel to the guest entrance which is great in the heat.If you're staying within the Imperial Club at Atlantis you can get your daily wrist bands from the Imperial Club reception desk on the 12th floor.You don't need to take towels as these are available free from kiosks and though they ask for your room number you can leave them anywhere in the park to be collected by staff.You can have food charged to your room at certain eating outlets within the park as well.If you don't fancy the walk from one end of the park to the other there is a golf cart type shuttle service that runs along the beach which you can use, there are pick up points along the route.Torrent river is a good way to have a look at the park as you float along in the tubes, but this is no lazy river, with rapids waves and waterfalls and its LONG! Its worth have a look at the map to see which branches you want to explore, you can even get up the Ziggurat tower from the river.The Ziggurat tower is where you slide down and exit through the fish tank while riding on a tube or you can do the steep drop (leap of faith). This tower has numerous tube rides and is a good starting point.The Barracudas tower has the large ring rides where you can sit in groups 5 or 6 and go on a tube ride. It also has the drop slide where you stand in a capsule and then the floor drops away beneath you - very scary!The restaurants are air conditioned in the park so great way to get out of the heat."

There were always sunbeds free and it wasn't too busy at all, maybe it was because we were there mid week in August? Longest queue we waited in was 10 mins for Leap of Faith, loved the lazy river, raft and ring rides. The torrent was so much fun, we are 2 young adults in our 20s and spent full days here 5 days in a row! Loved sitting in front of Leap of Faith at the end of the day watching people coming down the slide.We bought a refillable cup for 80 AED (\u00a313) with refills for 8 AED (\u00a31.30) was definitely worth it for us as we got 5 days use out of it. Ate in one of the restaurants but was just fast food wasn't the best, try the restaurants near the entrance instead TBJ or Asia Republic. One of the days we hired a Go Pro like camera, the staff at the entrance have them and charge 200 AED (\u00a332.00) it's a waterproof camera that you can strap to your wrist and take about 2000 photos and hours of video, your allowed to take it all round the lazy river and on all the slides, quality is excellent and we've brought some fab photos and videos home with us on memory card. Top tip take cheap flip flops your allowed to take them on most slides and on lazy river floor is unbearably hot without them!"

            "review": "Great Fun, but Muslims beware. This review is in two parts - One General review and one for Muslims:GENERAL REVIEWThe waterpark is great fun. There's three main waterparks to choose from within the UAE:: Aquaventure, Wild Wadi and Yas Waterworld. I haven't included Dreamland Aqua park as this is a little further out and I haven't been there but you can get some good groupon deals for that one so it's worth looking into.I had an Entertainer voucher for Aquaventure so we got half of our tickets for free (buy one get one free) so it's worth investing in an Entertainer booklet if there's 4+ more of you in a group as you'll recover the cost of the book just in using it here.There's lot of fun activities at Aquaventure for people of all ages. KIDS - The Splash Play area for kids is awesome, in fact the adults look like they enjoy it as much as the kids!! There's also a beautiful beach and the water rapids that take you around the park. If you have young children, pick up a rubber dingy that has a child seat. For thrill seekers there's lots to do on the two main buildings: Neptune tower and Poseidon Tower. Leap of Faith is a must do..awesome! On Poseidon tower there's a ride where you stand in a tube and floor dissapears leaving you in a freefall. another MUST DO.Negatives: This waterpark doesn't have shoe racks next to it's attractions so you have to just put your flip flops somewhere 'on the side' or carry them with you on board. In the summer months the floor is very hot and therefore when you leave a ride to go and collect your flip flops/footwear you will end up getting very hot/burnt feet! They don't spray the floor here like they do at other waterparks so beware!Be prepared to have a workout! you need to go and find a dingy and then carry it with you up all those stairs again and again for many of the rides that require a dingy :-( it get tiresome. They should have a system of just collecting it at the top of the tower. There are 7 rides on Neptune tower. 6 of them require a dingy so if you do all of them you'll be climbing all those steps holding a dingy! Despite the above, it's a great day out and still worth it. Tip: Make sure you put some money onto your wristband when you buy your tickets so you can go into the park and buy food etc without having to carry money. The remaining amount on your band can be refunded at the end of the day. BEWARE: They check your bags before you enter the park and won't allow you to take food or drinks into the park, so they can force you to buy their 55AED burgers (!) and high priced water :-)MUSLIMSThis is not a good place for us to visit unless our sisters go on a 'womens only' day or they start doing 'family days' where the dresscode is strict. On a normal day, there's just too much flesh on display due it being a main tourist attraction and the amount of sin we accumulate cannot justify the visit. Unless they start doing a 'family day' I will not be going back. There's a masjid at the park entrance, so no excuse to miss salah."

Admittedly I haven't been to any parks on the American continent, but here is what I thought of Aquaventure :Top service and care at the first aid station : no, I didn't have an accident in the waterpark, it was a jellyfish sting in the sea. They still attended to me in a very professional, considerate and friendly manner, and I believe this should be pointed out, as a waterpark is not only rides, but people too.About the fun now.....I think if I say we had to leave because it was closing down, I summarize pretty much everything ! Was there only in the afternoon, and it wasn't enough to go to all the attractions. Queuing time was acceptable (possibly due to the time of day and month ?), favorite slide (don't leave without trying this) was Posidon's revenge. But I only went to the Poseidon part of the park.You need to pay extra for zip lining....I think it is an unnecessary thing to have in a waterpark.In a nutshell, lots of fun, lots of laughter, don't miss it if you are staying at the Palm Hotel or nearby."

First was the breathtaking scenery of course from the moment we arrived up to the time we went home. To make this review more helpful, here are some pointers. 1) To make your day enjoyable, I suggest you book your ticket beforehand on the web. You can choose the type of ticket you'll be buying for your family which saves you lots of time. (the lines are very long in the queue)2) If you book one with the Aquarium package, go take a dip in their pool 1st before sightseeing in their \"The Lost Chambers Aquarium\"...Why, you might ask? Well the aquaventure only opens up to 5 PM then closes; while the aquarium remains open till night time3) There are lots of pool sides to choose from, but make sure you memorize your place and remember the signs else you will get lost... It is a very big place4) There are lots of sitting areas, food stalls and juice coolers so you and your family won't have to worry about \"little tummy cravings\"5) Life-jackets are available for free and so are their floaties which you can use to ride along the pool that makes a circuit to all their other pools 6) Their are many slide choices for adventurous adults and all of them are exhilarating7) The staff are very professional and they are very friendly. They monitor almost everyone and that is very calming for me who has a little boy who can't keep himself away from the waterNegative1) It is expensive, but worth the smiles, giggles and lots of splashing from your family...Enjoy! I know we did...."

The pavement is waaay too hot to walk on barefoot and there are no boxes near slides to deposit your belongings, hence I had to leave my slippers unattended and they were actually STOLEN. Overall I suppose if u go in decent weather you will probably have a lot more fun as the slides are fun and exciting."

Check out Aquaventure's own website for special packages (with tresor, towel, food, etc). These packages are also avaiable there. With or without kids - use the refill offer (it is cheaper all over the day) because do not forget to drink enough. Inside you will have an amazing, funny, thrilling day. But you can't hide from the sun (on one side really good, because you will be in the waters all the day) but you have to take care of your conditions. And bring some beach or water shoes to wear all the day because, clearly not in the water, the overheated walking ways will burn your feet. So leave behind all your days problems and become a kid again. There are water slides for nearly every age and the fun factor is for sure - if you like water!"

I am writing this review so extremely disappointed after our day at Aquaventure.Today I took my Mum and Dad (on holiday from the UK) for a day at the water park. After being previously in spring break we were looking forward to another great day of fun!It was so unbearably hot today and there was no escaping the heat to cool off in the water as it was like a hot bath. I CAN NOT believe that a 5 star resort like the Atlantis has no water cooler in the pools in this country!!!! My father over-heated and could not cool down so much so that i had to go home via the doctors to make sure he was ok.Last week in almost identical weather conditions we made a trip to Wild Wadi Waterpark in Jumeirah and I have to say it was 100% better than the Atlantis, as the water was perfectly chilled it gave you the opportunity to cool down and refresh before you moved on to your next ride.After spending 875AED for entry to the park and only managing to stay for 55 minutes, using only the lazy river, my son only using the children's area, I can say I am so very disappointed and annoyed at wasting all this money. If I had known the water was going to be so very hot there is no way I would have come along here today. It is unacceptable and should not be allowed to be operate in these conditions without appropriate cool water.I spoke with an Assistant Manager to try and ask for a % refund as never got our money's worth at all - she advised as we had already gained entry to the park this was not possible and gave me a general comments form to complete. Will wait to see what response I receive... But not holding my breath. Please DON'T waste your money or risk your health from over-heating!! Go to Wild Wadi in this hot weather!! "

I have booked it few days in advance and came there with my online ticket, and did not have to wait a long lines. I booked a small locker for 40 AEDs, the meal was 55 AEDs (fast food style cheeseburger with soda and fries), and the entrance price was 250 AEDs, so it was really expensive. A lot of slides and rides, and an open beach were really great, some of the rides are so good that you want to try them more than once or twice. There are probably a lot better aquaparks around the world with cheaper fares and prices. You could rent towels for the prices of 3 towels somewhere outside, so you better bring your own or buy somewhere else. When I was getting out I went to photo counter and they told me a photo is 85AEDs, but I could get two photos for 100AEDs, and that was the option I took. The photos come in hard copy in frames but they give you a link and a password to download them from the internet as well, so you also get a digital copy of the photo. Nice but expensive."

Accessed near e impressive looking Atlantis hotel the park was relatively well priced, but seemed cheaper online.We established base camp near the lazy river on well specified loungers -each having individual sun shelters attached (essential later in the day)The rides were good, if not a little tame compared to the U.S Florida parks. However Poseidon\u2019s Revenge got the pulse racing when the floor dropped away and a level of chaos ensued. The rapids were extensive and we enjoyed a good float around the park.Food was reasonably priced as was the drinks - quality was good. Offers are also available on entry. My only word of warning would be to bring adequate footwear as the flooring heats up quite considerably by the afternoon."

However, we were a little disappointed. The rides are varied and lovely but the place sadly lacked in organization. It was crowded, no shady places were organized (while lots of young children were there\u2026), the staff were friendly but a bit overwhelmed. The wait for getting to the rides was (1) long and (2) full of people pushing around. We also thought that while life guards were present and helpful on e.g. the Rapids, some rides were not organized safely (e.g. my husband, who's very tall, got his big toe caught in a net when starting a ride, you can imagine the pain\u2026). So\u2026 mixed experience\u2026 We'll try the Yas Waterworld in Abu Dhabi this October and hope for a better experience."

What i liked was how easy it was to get on the rides, no queues whatsoever and a good variety. We made the mistake of joining the wrong line at one point and ending up on a slide which basically the perspex floor gives way and you suddenly drop through a tube... great fun but not for the faint hearted.The food wasn't bad either and even serve during Ramadan. They have their own private beach which we didn't frequent but were very impressed by the shuttle service along the beach front for those who don't fair well in the heat.A lovely lovely day out."

There are guides on hand for every ride, so you dont have to worry too much. We could do with more options for beverages, or maybe it was because we visited during Ramadhan; that said, there were no provisions formore stands. A description of what to expect on each ride would be helpful, I skipped out on the rapids and waves because I didnt know what to expect. Love the buggies, and cooling of walkways. Many options of rides too. On the whole a great experience."

My main issue with the park was how epensive things were, there were no water fountains available and since it is very hot you have to keep buying drinks all day which obviously adds up! The slides were pretty good, since the park is fairly new, the slides don't hurt your back when you go down them, and there were a few more adventurous slides, but it was quite annoying that on every ring ride you would end up in the lazy river at the end, and then you had to go right around it to get back to wherever you had left your flipflopsOverall, we had a good day here but bring lots of money!"

The water park is huge and has loads of different areas so you don't feel like you are on top of people. There's a great variation of rides, thrill seeker or something less scary (me!) I think the price is great compared to what I've paid at other water parks and you get a meal and entrance to the Lost Chambers included too. I caught a bit of skin on my foot and had to get medical assistance, these guys are great too. Even though they must see loads of daft people all day they don't make you feel an annoyance to them. If you don't fancy rides or water there are loads of places to sit in the sun, by the pools or down on the beach looking over to the main city. Would deffo recommend this to everyone and will be taking my parents when they come over for a visit."

Splashers is a kids splash area with slides. My husband and I were very disappointed that we could not take our five year old daughter and her six year old friend on any of the other slides due to height restrictions. This was surprising to me since my husband and I took our daughter when she was four years old to Yas Waterworld and she was able to enjoy all of the slides and was not just restricted to the kids area. Our favorite ride was the lazy river with the rapids. I have been to many water parks and I think Aquaventure has the best lazy river ride. Other than that we were not impressed with the place. If you go to Aquaventure and you are NOT staying at the hotel, BRING YOUR OWN TOWELS! Or you will have to pay Dhs 30 for each towel!! Water is also a rip off at Dhs 11 or Dhs 13 per small bottle. I have two prices because we were told two different prices at the park. Since we are UAE residents and it was Ramadan we were able to take advantage of a 3 for 1 deal. One price for the water park, aquarium and lunch per person. That was a good deal and I suggest going to Aquaventure during Ramadan when there are not waits for the slides, not crowded and you can save money, otherwise it is not worth it."

Booked the summer deal which includes lunch and free entry to Lost Chambers Aquarium, these were both great, lunch was surprisingly excellent quality considering it was free and Lost Chambers was a great way to wind the evening down after the thrills of the water park.Overall, a totally epic day out, and not hugely expensive either."

It had a great selection of rides - at least 6 that were a little bit scary but still family friendly and then 2 which were definitely not for the faint hearted! Plus a long river that you can leisurely float along and a rapids section which was pretty fun and rough enough to tip one of our friends off her ring. We went during Ramadan and it was really quiet - we didn't have to wait for any rides and there were no queues anywhere including the entrance, the foodcourt etc. We only went on each ride once and had lunch and still spent over 3 hours there - you could easily spend all day if you wanted to laze around in the pools and go on the rides multiple times. In terms of attire I wasn't sure what to wear to be culturally sensitive so ended up taking a bikini plus a quick dry t-shirt which I felt comfortable in. Most people were just wearing bikinis though - apparently wearing t-shirts/rash vests slows you down on the slides. I would recommend eating at Barracudas which has 4-5 standard takeaway options. There are options for vegetarians which is great. Lockers and towels are available for hire but you really don't need a towel as it's so hot you dry off after being out of the water for 2 minutes!"

The kids thoroughly enjoyed themselves same as the mothers. The water park left everyone exhausted and the kids were asleep before we got back to the hotel. A must go place for the kids in Dubai.

All main rides are really high up - so u need to climb many floors for each of them. For me - climbing three floors to get a thrill of 1 minute was worth only 4-5 times. After that i didnt want to climb so many stairs - carrying water tubes for such short fun.2. Rides are scary and similar - they just make you climb up and throw you down. Even the rides with different names are actually very similar in experience.3. Locker rentals are separate - but if you don't carry anything expensive, you can just leave you stuff on one side and go.Now the positives: i loved the lazy river and the private beach. Lazy rives is very well designed - it has rapids, torrent and waterfall. Looked very safe with life guards at every spot."

First thing is, lockers split by gender which means you have to pay for two or ask your partner to store things for you and have to pass your stuff outside. I understand UAE culture but Yas Waterworld in Abu Dhabi has mixed locker rooms for couples and families. The rings for the slides are far from the slides and are just randomly on the edge of a pool. There are good slides and they are all conveniently located in 2 towers so you don't get lost looking for the slides. The river is a good mix of relaxing lazy river and exciting rapids. The river also connects to one of the towers meaning you can get to the tower with slides without any steps via a upward sloping escalator. Very good waterpark but not as good as Yas Waterworld in abu dhabi or Aquatica, Wet N Wild, Disneys Blizzard Beach in Florida."

I would definitely recommend to buy tickets online as you can save a lot of time on waiting in queue. They will give you a bracelet with access to the park. But for some stupid reason - if you need a towel (obviously you need one) you have to get a paper receipt and !!! carry it with you until you decide to get a towel from a counter located in the middle of the park. And it's in a waterpark, btw. How you suppose to keep a small piece of paper while using rides? No idea. So you either take towel from the start and keep it somewhere(no idea where) or use rides, then go back to your changing room, take paper, go back to the waterpark and exchange it for the towel. Ridiculous. You will get another bracelet if you want to put some money to your account. Place is a bit overcrowded. There are not too many rides, btw. But you definitely should try the main one - \"Leap of faith\". Try not to close your eyes as the view is amazing, you will get through aquarium with sharks. Fascinating! Long wait but worth trying. The place is cowered by trees and palms so overall it is not too hot inside. Try to come early and avoid weekends to enjoy the time without waiting."

There are lots of rides so there is something for everyone, those wanting to relax can take a rubber ring around the lazy river whilst thrill seekers can try many of the parks more adventurous rides such as Leap of Faith or my personal favourite Poseidon\u2019s Revenge! (not for the faint hearted!). There are also lots of 'beach' areas for anyone who just wants to sunbathe or wait for family/friends.We visited on a weekday in May and there were no real queues which was nice. I can imagine it would get busy at a weekend though so probably best to arrive early if you want to go on the most popular rides. The park was clean and the electronic locker system was easy to use and worked well (providing you do not lose your wristband on the rides!). Lifeguards were friendly and added to the fun.The only downside we experienced was trying to find a double rubber ring at the beginning of the day! It was not made clear how to get one and given that half of the rides require a rubber ring it would have been nice to be directed towards them. Overall though a great water park that's definitely worth the visit.Useful Tips: - If anyone burns easily it is worth wearing a UV protection top (available in the UK from Decathlon) as you can easily burn whilst out all day - especially children! You can buy them at the park at an inflated cost, although they do come Palm Atlantis branded.- In a summer when the temperatures rise it is worth taking flip-flops/reef shoes as the paths around the park gets really hot and will make getting around quite unpleasant."

I have stayed at Atlantis 3 times now and as a hotel guest you get unlimited free entry to the park, you can also get a buggy to take you from the hotel to the park. There are a lot of rides at the park mostly off the lazy river, this is a great touch as it means you don't have to get out and walk to the rides which means no burnt feet! The rides are good fun and mostly aimed at adults which is good as they are not boring, especially the leap of faith! I think all the rides require you to be over 120cm tall which means there isn't that much for smaller children to take part in, however anyone can go around the lazy river and the rapids. The side where the newer building of rides are is usually much quieter and there are a lot of sun beds available, it is also right next to a cafe and changing rooms which is handy. Aquadventure is on par with disney and other watermarks in the US, even if you aren't staying at Atlantis it is definitely worth a visit to the park!"

We had brought UV vests for the whole family, and swim shoes from the UK, as didn't want to burn and waste time creaming up every hour or so. This is well worth doing, as it will be extremely hard getting your kids (and adults) off the rides to cream them up. I don't like fast rides etc, but throughly enjoyed the lazy river and the rapids which join on to them. Great fun had by all.There are plenty of lifeguards everywhere, and they are a real good laugh. They started recognising our children, and spinning them on their rubber rings before going down the rapids. This was great fun for the kids!There are plenty of places to buy drinks, snacks, food etc. Came away exhausted, but fab time had by all. Wish we had more time to do it again."

You can use their lockers at 40AED and they had a package of 250AED/adult for park entrance, combo meal and entrance to the lost chamber aquarium. To dive with dolphins is around 700AED depending on which ride you want to do. The great idea is that almost all slides takes you to the same current river that circulates all park and you can go from one to other very fast. It will only depend on your strength to climb several times the stairs. But, without been a fun of this kind of attractions, I thought it was a great fun at the end. The slides are easy and fun and if you want to stay far from the noise, you can relax in the beach.

Arrived at Aquaventure Waterpark just as it opened at 10.00 via the Monorail and after finding our way to the entrance queued for approx. 20 mins to get tickets - out of 9 ticket desks only 3 were open. They are currently running a 3 for 1 summer deal where you pay 285UAED/adult for park entrance, lunch and entrance to The Lost Chambers attraction. I noticed that as you move through the turnstiles a member of staff would check all baggage to prevent people bringing their own food into the park - hence they can tap for everything!Towels & locker hire is available in a combo for 70UAED/pp - note: the lockers are small but quite deep so you can get a reasonable size back pack in there and they operate via a wrist band with a bar code.TOP TIP: now that the daily temperatures are in the 40's do not forget to keep your flip flops on! By the afternoon walking from the lockers to the water is almost impossible as the floor is so hot. Also, once you're in the water the bottom has a rough texture which can also damage the soles of your feet. Next to the lockers is a small kiosk - if all else fails they sell lightweight pool shoes which you can wear all the time including on the rides. I wish I\u2019d of found that first as my feet go trashed over the course of the day which slightly spoiled the event.There have been points made over the food combo deals. Yes most of is deep fried but there are healthier alternatives to the usual burger and chips. I found the only real problem was the time we had to queue to order the food even though we left lunch until around 14.30 thinking it might be quieter, and the park wasn\u2019t that busy - pot luck I suppose!Overall I enjoyed the day there.

You won't be bored, that I promise and there is plenty of sun loungers, umbrella's for those who want to take time offCamera's around the park will snap you if you time it right and I believe these photo's worked out \u00a315 GPB roughly same price as Alton Towers etc in the UK so not a bad price at all really. IceCreams etc of course are all going to be expensive remember you are at a tourist resort however if you go with the package, although it doesn't include ice creams it does unlimited drinks and food. We also got to bring home a lovely Atlantis Water Park Giant Drinks container that I am sure we will never use again! LolIf you want a fun day out, let yourself go at the Aquaventure Park! You won't regret it - Any questions send them my way! x"

On top you should consider the towel 35 Dir each towel and 25 for the locker. The kids under 1.20 mt can go only to the kids play area that it's ok for half day. After that it's getting boring. On the 3 for 1 offer is included: 1) entry at the park.2)lunch that it was very disappointing, misleading. The 2 restaurants are inside the adventure park so no same level of the hotels. Very bad. Same level of McDonald.3) The Lost chamber that is a magnificent aquarium.Overall it's a good package but the lunch is upsetting, they should advert a snack sandwich. Rides are good but the best is the lost camber where you can see the divers feeding the fishes."

We started afloat on the lazy river, then laughed our way through the rapids and the waves. We got a bit adventurous and started on the slides. One of the most enjoyable slide was shark attack where in we floated through a tube in an aquarium full of sharks and stingrays. It was cool and my son was thrilled. The later part of the day we spent in the childrens water area where there were smaller slides. Please take your own towels and wear flip flops.The food was very expensive and we enjoyed the frozen yogurt available just outside the park where we pick the photographs. We spent time at the beach and admired the huge pink structure called Atlantis. A very enjoyable day indeed."

For adults there are 8 main slides (split in between Neptune towers and Poseidon towers). The slide Leap of faith is very scary and Revenge of Poseidon is EXTREME as you feel quiet close to free fall.What you should know and recommendations: - The queue to get in can take as long as 1 hour on a busy day.- Bring your own towels as they ll charge you AED30 for theirs.- Dubai being a for-profit spirited city, you also have to pay for a locker AED70 if I remember well.- The park tickets include a free meal in one of 2 selected restaurants. I don't know about the other but Shark bites is a low quality fast food (chunk of fat in the burgers, garden salad is actually fresh) where we queued and waited more than 1 hour to eat.- The ticket includes access to a nice and relaxing aquarium (perfect after a long day outdoors)- Put waterproof sun protection as you can be in the sun for a while like in the rapids- Wear a T shirt in the slides where your body is in direct contact with the tube (no donut or other type of rubber ring) as it can hurt your shoulder blade a little.This park is very very fun and the perfect activity on a hot day for adults (or children bigger than 1m20) looking for a thrill!"

After having so many such water parks\u2019 experiences in different countries, we can say it was an average experience. Good to spend cool time especially when heat is taking its peak of the summer. Rest all rides were common as found in other water parks too; only one unique experience of Poseidon\u2019s Revenge ride was thrilling. Here at first one get thrilled to enter the capsule, but then for sure mind rethink of getting in with heart bits rising. Very exciting seconds once the base floor falls and our body get through the capsule with gravity. No words to say about it. Such rides are getting in at many new water parks now (I was told even Yas Waterworld opened recently during late 2012 at Abu Dhabi is having this ride), but frankly we experienced it for the first time.A beauty of this water park is that for adults there are two towers \u2013 Tower of Naptune and Tower of Poseidon. Each tower has 6 and 4 rides respectively. So we don\u2019t have to move around to different places to find the rides. Same for the kids rides too.A water park with beach around and indoor river feelings all at one place to enjoy summer time is felt really good and comfortable.Staff members at sites are very nice and make you feel of hospitality and services they are ready to give. Food options are many, but really tooooo much expensive. A small water bottle of 13 AED and soda drinks starting 18 AED. One can think of food costs! This is our common experiences at UAE. Unlike South Korea, by not allowing outside food and drink items all such tourist places in UAE are selling food and drink items at extremely high cost. At the end of the day you end up spending equal amount for water and food w.r.t. entry ticket.At the end of the day our group of four families had good fun and joy. Got relaxed and enjoyed very well. Worth visiting once to have fun from many such other options of amusement and water parks now available in UAE."

It has the best slides & doesn't tend to get too busy - the park is large and also has a beach which overlooks the palm, Burj Arab & Burj Khalifa.The majority of slides are accesses from with the two towers. The Tower of Neptune contains the leap of faith & Shark Attack - both of which send you through a shark tank so you can view the sealife within the aquarium.The Tower Of Poseidon contains the newer slides including two awesome raft rides & Poseidon's Fury (the best slide in the park) which drops you through a trapdoor.For younger guests there is a kiddies play area & the rapids are great fun for the whole family & take you on a circuit of the whole park.Sun loungers are everywhere & you can always find one no matter what time of day (especially at the beach). Queues are well shaded, but you will definitely need flip flops as the ground when walking around the park gets unbearably hot in the Dubai heat!Food & drink is very expensive within the park & you are not allowed to bring you own, locker hire is not included as part of the ticket price & start at 40AED.The staff are friendly & lifeguards are everywhere, the toilets & showers are super clean & really well maintained. Parking is free, but you do need to get the ticket stamped when collecting your waterpark tickets.The only downside to our visit was that we had purchased tickets online, but it took over half an hour to queue up & collect them upon arrival! There is currently a good promotion which gives you waterpark entry, free lunch & access to the lost chambers aquarium for 250 AED for tourists & 165 AED for UAE residents - but this must be purchased online."

Amazing experience, lines move quickly on a good day and the rides are there to excite. IT feels unfinished and the BIGGEST issue is the wayfinding. Those guys know how to build, but they dont know how to traffic manage people. The lack of signage and clear instructions is quite amazing. Some of the top rides are not even signposted and its like a choose your own adventure. IF you like that you will love this. Quality venue and will get better over time.If you want a quiet break go to the beach on the side. nice view and free sunbeds. Also the best way to do it if you have unlimited cash or are silver spooned is to stay at the atlantis. Then you get access to the golf carts and they take you everywhere. Space is not an issue in dubai :)"

Excellent rides and like the fact that most rides are designed to be accessible from the same place so you dont have to keep walking hours on end to visit different rides.. the ticket which included a meal at the fried chicken place was the worst food I have ever had in Dubai, I have been to Wild Wadi and the best thing about it excluding the rides that I remember was having the burger! The food in Aquaventure was extremely dissapointing and very poor however for the rides it was very good. Tip to get a GOPRO cam to record and take pictures for the day, they give you a memory card and you can take thousands of photos through the day, well worth it and saves you carrying your mobile around with you!"

I haven't been to a water park before so hubby said since we're in Dubai, where practically everything is over the top, he should take me to Aquaventure. the slides were awesome, it's a good way to conquer fear ( I can't believe one Amazing race contestant refused to do the slides leading to their elimination.) but a lot of the attractions were closed. The Chamber of secrets were closed, which is part of our ticket. I asked for a discount but they refuse it give it, telling us that we can come another day ( we were bound back for the US early the following day.) The slide, I forgot what it's called where you can ride a lifesaver and see marine life is closed. The zipline which is freaking 75UAD is a total disappointment. It was supposed to be the longest zip line in the middle east, but the reason for that was because it was broken down into three sections, so you just launched and you're back on a platform again. Dubai seemed to have thought of everything in their bathroom but Aquaventure forgot to at least give courtesy bags for wet clothes. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision for us so we weren't quite prepare, and we have to lug wet suits with us all the way home to our hotel. Don't forget to bring towels, as they charge almost $11 for those to rent. You don't have to rent lockers which we did the mistake of doing, costing us another $11. All in all, it's a one time adventure to go to, but won't be back again."

Atlantis has been pushing these new attractions all spring, to get there and find they're not working is pretty poor. No discount, like it or lump it because there's plenty more where you came from.... Also many of the rides weren't open for the 10am start time, maintenance works were still being carried out with the promise 'they might open later'. Food in the park was worse than I remembered, nothing that isn't deep fried and utterly tasteless and having to pay extra for attractions, lockers and towels once inside is really sneaky. The new rides just basically offer the variety Aquaventure was lacking before but certainly don't bring it up to Waterworld standard.... And no water fountains here like they have a Wild Wadi.One redeeming feature was the promo which gave me free entrance to the Lost Chambers (a delight!) but the other members of my party didn't qualify because they used an Entertainer voucher... Won't be heading back again."

There were plenty of sun lounges with clever little canopies on them so you were protected from the sun if you wished. The lazy river was excellent as it had small rapids and there was never a lack of rubber rings. The aquarium was impressive. The only disappointment was the lunch. They advertised it as 'eat in one of our 7 restaurants'. It was basically 2, what I would only call a motorway services cafeterias and it was pretty much burger or chips or nothing. Very disappointing. But, we paid Dhs 285 each for the day and thought we got our monies worth."

I'd recommend buying the food combo with the tickets at the main gate as it does end being a lot cheaper than paying separately later in the Shark Bites area. I also recommend buying the Gold Entertainment book as that gives you vouchers of buy a ticket and get one free which makes it a lot cheaper! We took our own towels and didn't bother getting a locker as it is quite safe. We just left all bags etc on the sun lounger. I wouldn't get too stressed if you don't get as many loungers as your party number as you only need 1 to dump you stuff on as you will be just running from one ride to another with a huge grin on your face!! :-D"

We spent 9 hours in this wonderful park having fun on all the rides and making use of all of the facilities. The staff in the park are amazingly friendly and it is so clean and easy to get around. We were there mid week and did not have to wait for any rides but was told weekends can get very busy so getting there early is a tip or arriving later in the afternoon when it is a bit cooler. Bring plenty of sun cream, a rash shirt and thongs as the heat is intense and the concrete paving around the park gets very hot.

Wonderful experience. Other rides include lazy river with rapids option (which was the best ride for my 5 year old daughter since she was below the height limit for most of the rides). Tip: Awesome waterfalls in the lazy river in one end which is the best back massage you will get....just stand under the falls and enjoy! :))Do not bring food into the park, since it might get trashed by the security. There are lots of food options in the park, restaurants and food booths. The park is very clean and service is very good."

We descided to go for the full package because we had vouchers from our hotel. Once to got in I thought the locker system was brilliant, I didn't need to worry about losing my key; they give you a band that you scan to open your locker. The locker rooms themselves have hair dyers, shampoo etc. once on the rides WOW! The best park park I've ever been to. I love water rides these were amazing. I can't remember the one where you got into the tube and the door closes and your drop well anyways I couldn't do that. Also my partner and I swam with sharks stinraes ect which only cost \u00a345 pounds each. We went onto every ride time and time again with no lines. The rides are amazing nothing like Spain. There is something for everyone at this park... Even though I didn't go to the kiddie park they looked like they having a lot of fun. Right tip- when the waterpark closes there is a HUGE line for taxis. What we did is walked through the hotel to the main entrance where there were loads of taxis waiting for people. You do have to lie and say your staying at the hotel but a little lie never hurt anyone. It saved us 50mins. :)"

But the real reason for this review is to pass on a message to Aquaventure:While using the toilet at the main pool area a staff member came in, did his business and left WITHOUT washing his hands. I walked out after him thinking he was the cleaner who keeps this place spotless, but he walked straight into the closest food outlet. I know you probably hire people with limited educations and pay them minimal wages so they are not rocket scientists, but you have to teach them the importance of the basics like washing their hands. Left me with a sour taste!One tip.... as we left we saw thay you can buy day 2 tickets for (i think ) 100 dhm less.Our 5-year-old hated the rides. The 11 and 14 year olds loved them as did I.

Ask for it after you get inside the water park because they always say they are full when you buy tickets outside but if you ask a park attendant, you can usually get one. They make a huge difference as you can stash your bags there and there are \"free\" towels and it is away from the madness. Very well thought out water park, with access to the beach and some very scary but fun water slides. The rapids and children's splash zone were fun for the kids."

We spent hours just relaxing in the rapids going round and round. I'm not one for going on rides on my own but there were many where there was the option to go in a double ring so that was a definite bonus for me.A downside is that there was nowhere near enough sunbeds for everyone. We got there within an hour of the park opening and couldn't find one free bed. There were even areas that people had reserved and I can see why now!Also one major downfall was the floor....the floor was boiling hot everywhere!! Some areas were bearable so obviously there are floor tiles available that don't burn your feet, however most places we walked we were running into the shaded areas and we saw many others doing this also. My boyfriend had expensive Nike shoes on so didn't want to simply leave them by the side of the pool.Overall it was a nice day out though with plenty of rides to choose from and nice places to eat."

There is different kinds of attractions for both people who like and don't like adrenaline !A special good point for the trap door water slide which was really sensational. There was a problem with the floor of the changing room which was wet and dirty, very unpleasant to walk on, they should invest on some special swimming pool floor. The electronic locker system was blocked at the end of the day which made a pretty bad mess as everyone was waiting for a single employee to open their locker manually, bad luck?"

We arrived at 10am and it was packed out we thought if we arrived early the queues would be ok but they was'nt we spent about 30 minutes in the queue waiting to pay. We had the combo ticket which got you into the park and into the lost chambers. Worked out around 990 dirhams. There is different options you can have like just entrance into the waterpark only and you pay extra for the cable wire if you want to go on that. There is extras for lockers, towels etc too but we took our own and kept our bags with us as it seemed easier than keep going back to the lockers which were by entrance. The dolphin experiences are opposite the tills for the waterpark and they were alot quieter. I went on the beach as i could'nt use the slides as i had an ear infection but my little girl and partner went on all the slides they had a great time. They did have to queue for most rides due to how busy it was and there were little sunloungers available round the pools etc. The beach was great lots of sun loungers, water was warm but lots of jelly fish. Lots of shaded areas under the trees. There is plenty of places to grab food it is over priced but it always is at attractions. The tropical sno hut is great they sell like slushes but looks like a snowball 3 of them cost 90 dirhams for the small size but worth having one. Def worth going but try and book online to avoid the queues and i think its a touch cheaper online we paid adult price for our 10 year old daughter so bear that in mind too."

There are a 2 scary rides... The leap of faith and the revenge, both were amazing with kids around 12 giving them a go. Although be warned the revenge hurts your back as you're suspended in a tube before launch & the sections were the tubes meet are not quite flush. Lunch @ shark bites was reasonable 70AED for a double cheeseburger meal (huge patties) 50AED for 2pcs chicken meal both with drinks. I would definitely book online beforehand. I did ours the night before as we hadn't decided which day of our trip to go & the queue was half the size. Waterproof camera/go pro if you have one take it!! We captured some amazing pictures & video. One on shark attack going through the tube surrounded by sharks and sting rays!! Just like on the adverts... Incredible :-) Words of warning... These rides throw you around so a scantily clad bikini is not appropriate! If you have a large chest you can get a rash tshirt from Atlantis for 210AED I bought one at the end of the day as I had a Nike sports bra (the non clasp ones) on to keep my dignity. I saw several women having to cover themselves up mid ride and one lady even lost her bottoms on one ride as it propels you upwards using jets of water... The 50ppl at the end of the ride including children did not find it very amusing. We finished off our day with a walk around the lost chambers which we found fascinating. We sat for around 20mins in front of one tank just watching in awe of these majestic creatures. Although it could be seen as an expensive day out especially for a family, you pay more for Thorpe Park & Alton Towers whilst this is probably a once in a lifetime holiday I would say go for it as the memories are worth it. Happy water sliding!! "

We were at the kempinsky mall of the Emirates and decided to go by taxi which cost us 30 AED each way. We avoided the mono rail as it isn't connected to the metro and had mixed reviews on trip advisor. We were there in 15 minutes. The lines are long even the prepaid ones, you'd wish they had barcode printouts that they would just scan and print but it's manual entry and takes a good 5 mins per person. We rented a locker at 40 AED it's big enough to fit a 15' laptop backpack and can be opened multiple times, just that the barcode key they strap to your wrist is a little difficult to operate. We also got us a meal combo at 45 AED each. Consists of a burger / shwarma /hot dogs with fries and a drink. Based on reviews we read we carried our own towels and avoided additional rentals. There are ample pool chairs at the resort and finding one isn't tough. Travel to the resort in flip flops and Bermuda and tshirt, it's entrance is totally separate from the palm and no formal dress code is required. The rides are amazing and you will want to do each one again for sure. We did each ride an average if 2 times each. But walking up the taller rides starts taking a toll later. Especially since you have to watch your step on the chipped edges of most steps on to the leap of faith and watch your hands on the make shift railing on parts of the stairs on the way to Poseidon's revenge. There's a lot to walk as well in the park so come prepared. I regret having purchased the lost chambers ticket it wasn't up to my satisfaction, quite brief and can be done with in 10 mins. 2 Large tanks and a few small tanks of jelly fish and some others. You may want to skip it in like of the aquarium at the Dubai mall. Have fun and enjoy yourselves."

The only slight negative I can come up with is that around the childrens area there isn't enough shade and the beds with the portable shades aren't that great. When it's 35 degrees it would have been nice to sit in a shaded area which didn't seem to be in abundance unless you hired a cabana for the day which were all hired and not that many there anyway.

A little too much for a toddler, but there is not much else to do for this age group. You have to pay extra for a locker and towels if you didn't bring it yourself. Even though we had prepaid tickets, we had to que for 15-20 min in order to get our entry wristbands. Upon entering the park, they search your bags and any food will have to be removed. Inside the park, there are kiosks, primarily selling junk food, but the restaurants does sell some healthy foods, eg salads. All in all a good day, but value for money could be better."

The park is beautifully laid out and the slides are incredible. We stayed until 6pm ! Even though it was a Saturday in British school holidays there were few queues and even when we did queue it was no more than 15 mins - beats Florida!! Food was varied and plentiful but expect to pay quite a bit - \u00a33 for a small ice cream or milkshake. Our favourite rides were at the temple of posidean where we loved the large raft rides but my husband and 7 yr old also loved the almost vertical leap of favourite. The park was spotlessly clean, the toilets and changing area were just lovely. Make sure you pop up and see the dolphins and take a look at the shark tank ( which you can ride theough!!)"

It takes almost more than 3-4 hours to complete and once done, you feel like doing certain rides a couple of more times. Really enjoyable if you attend with a group of friends. All the rides are 100% safe. However, didn't have time to explore other areas including the aquarium and the dolphin bay. If planning to visit, I'd like to recommend to be there early to prevent any disappointment at the end of the day for not covering most of the rides. The queues could be quite long in the weekends so try to visit early on weekdays."

I would strongly recommend that people arrive early; we arrived at 1130 and got on all the rides really quickly with no queuing - this was not the case in the afternoon. Equally, I would suggest that people walk through the park and get a sun lounger on the beach where you get a lovely breeze. The park doesn't really cater for little babies (ours is 9 months) with a lack of shade but overall I would absolutely recommend this as a great day out."

Our visit to Aquaventure was included in our hotel stay with Atlantis, and the staff was helpful enough to let us use the water-park for the full day even after we checked out of the hotel without an additional charge. The water-park has rides for everyone, across all age groups. The Splasher's play area for children is a lot of fun for the little ones, and our 3-year old spent most of his time there and in the Lazy River, which is slow-moving stream of water with 2-3 waterfalls in between. Other than the rides for children, the park is mainly divided into two towers - Neptune (NT) and Poseidon's (PT). There are water-rides and slides of all levels of adventure, starting from plain fun to extremely scary rides. The ones that we found scariest were Poseidon's Revenge (in PT) and Leap of Faith (in NT), which look like quite a suicide, but are good fun at the end of it. The park is open between 10:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., and is relatively empty before 11:00 a.m. and after 5:00 p.m. with no or very less waiting time for the rides. In between (11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.), it is extremely crowded and the average waiting time for any water-ride is easily over 30 minutes, even on weekdays. So you can hardly do too much during these hours. It's advisable to make use of 10-11 a.m. and 5-6:30 p.m. time. Without the long queues and waiting time, the water-park is easily coverable in 2-4 hours. I found this the best part of our Dubai vacation, and I would highly recommend this waterpark"

The staff at the ticket desk told us we could fit 2 big bags in a small one. Not a chance, so we had to queue up again to get a 2nd one which was very irritating. Other than that the rides are good fun, even if you're not a great swimmer as the waters shallow on most. I avoided anything that you didn't go on in the ring, I wasn't brave enough! A pity you can't see more of the dolphins and sea lions unless you pay extra as the water park tickets alone aren't cheap. Don't count on using the hairdryers ladies. Only one was working when I was there which people were fighting over and it eventually over heated and turned off :) I took my own but couldn't find a plug apart from in the changing room entrance where there were no mirrors. So if you're planning to get ready there to go onto dinner at the palm after it isn't ideal. We got the aquarium/ water park combo ticket. The aquarium is lovely, its calm and great to chill out after the park. It's not very big though. I'd recommend buying tickets for the water park online as we were told to buy on the day as the queues would be short, but it took at least 20 mins to get ours."

The younger kids play area was mayhem with water shooting and falling from all directions. The Stinger ride is great. The Zoomeranga is one that the whole family can do together. The drop is terrifying so be warned. The double rings area great for an adult and child to ride together. The staff was everywhere and they are great fun. The only minor criticism is that there does not seem to be enough double rings with a sealed bottom child seat. Once you get one you need to hang onto it. But the water park is highly recommended and even the food was good."

We were trying to decide whether to go to this water park or WildWadi and after reading some of the other reviews we decided to try Aquaventure because it seemed the better park for small children. We went with friends and children who are 3 & 5 and I have to say this park was perfect. We got there at about 11am and were able to secure some beds near a nice shallow pool area within easy walking distance of the children's play area and food and drink outlets. Both children adored the children's water area and I really liked the fact we could play with them on it and also use some of the slides. The lifeguards were fantastic, interacting with both us and the children and making sure that we all had a fabulous time and were also safe. The lazy river was great once we found the joint rubber rings in which the children could sit at one end. My not very brave 3 year old didn't like the rapids, my 5 year old loved them so I guess it depends a lot on the child. The adults took it in turns to visit the more adventurous rides and the queues were very manageable. Food and drinks were fine and the portions plentiful. Wouldn't hesitate to go again."

Purchase your tickets online prior to attendance, its quick, simple and cheaper to boot and can be done five minutes before you arrive, just give the ticket desk your reference number on your phone or print the receipt prior to attendance. Also try and attend on a weekday as weekends can be busy, I attended on a Friday and it was brisk but not too busy but I can imagine on weekends it becomes unbearably busy. The park charges for towels and lockers so if you can, take towels with you and unless your carrying a suitcase full of stuff or are taking a lot of children the smaller of the two lockers should be big enough for a couple. Be mindful not to take food or drink into the park with you as during entry they check your bags which I find quite rude. Prices for food and drink from park vendors isn't cheap but its normal highly inflated theme park pricing in action.Most rides we got on within 10 minutes, only Leap of Faith had queues longer than 20 minutes. This is the parks main attraction thrill slide and although it is very exciting its not all its cracked up to be and over before you know it. For my money the scariest slide is Poseidon\u2019s Revenge. This slide was awesome, once inside the standup capsule you stand on a clear perspex floor with a black hole below. As the clear perspex door traps you in a voice counts down 3-2-1 and the floor falls out dropping you down a near vertical hole. The lazy river and rapids were good, as were the numerous rides requiring inflatables. There are numerous loungers with canopies littered around the park, all invariably around pools. These are free to use and plentiful but depending on when you arrive you may have to go to the rear of the park to find empty ones. The grounds are stunning, as is the beach which sits on the inside of the Palm. We had a great day and it was well worth the money."

The park provides single and double rubber tyres and we stayed together the whole time (good if you're a bit scared on the rides) and you use these on most of the rides. I didn't go on the 180 degrees drop rides when you don't use a rubber ring as I don't like heights/speed/being enclosed (!) but they looked awesome.There is a private beach which all park users can use free of charge that had lots of trees for shade and some grass which would be useful for people who didn't want to spend all day in the park. We dropped our stuff on a sun lounger and came back to it throughout the day, very safe. There are also lockers (not free) to keep any valuables. We didn't know whether to go to Wild Wadi or here so I asked a Dubian family member which was better and she said Aquaventure as it has more things to do and the beach was a definite plus point."

Lockers are available for your bags etc but also come at a price, the small lockers are just big enough to put a pair of shoes and a few items of clothing. Anything bigger will require a large locker. Best advice would be to go early, get yourself a suitable sun chair and leave your bags and towels on your desired chairs. This is seemingly the done thing as most good chairs are \"reserved\" before lunchtime. To save a bit of money look into buying \"The Entertainer Dubai\", this book comes with near 2000 buy one get one free vouchers which include Adult, Children and a locker vouchers.

This new section is not as muli interconnected as other rides but rapids will get you to barracuda bay where you exit and leave you float ring to join Poseidon.By interconnected I mean you can even stay in your float ring and join a lift up to other rides without needing to get out and walk and carry your float device.

There are definitely better options so don't go there!Others have had bad reviews about the lockers - its a bit hard to scan the barcode at first but overall the system is fantastic with a barcoded wristband linked to your locker and there's a lady in the ladies locker room at all times who can help you if you have any issues, so I would definitely recommend you get a locker.The only major issue we had was getting there when we werent staying at Atlantis - we got a taxi from the nearest monorail station and it cost about 22AED each way so just be prepared with time and money to travel there."

There is a real lack of slides that are different to each other and I wouldn't pay to return. I visited on a Friday morning and did the park and ride - TIP - Park in the avenues to save getting on a dirty minibus and having to wait for it to be full before it leaves. We used the entertainer voucher and paid for a small locker which was actually big enough for a large beach bag and two large towels so unless a family i wouldn't bother with the large size. As expected food is quite pricey and is just the standard burger, pizza, chicken and chips fast food style. It did get much busier in the afternoon but by this time I was bored and went to the beach to relax. I definitely prefer Yas over Aquaventure. Yes there are large rides but they are so similar it lacks any kind of excitement after a while and I also thought the water level was quite low and in the lazy rivers meant that one person had to push you around."

With the heavy ticket price they charge they do not give even a penny worth of value.The staff is unfriendly and do not help you with anything, unless you are buying something from them , like the dolphin experience etc.No map, no directions, you will be lost, where to find what, and what are the rides that you can do, which ones your kids can do? Some places you are even expected to carry your own float almost to a level of first or second floor.They want to make money in everything, towel rental is 30 dirham, which is just crazy. The big locker is 75 dirhams and if you open it once, your money is gone, you will have to hire the locker again, which again is just absurd.If you have kids who are below 11, they don't have much to do, as most of the rides are huge, and the kids get frightened just looking at the heights. So the kids just end up doing lazy river and the kid splash area, for which going to this place is just waste of money.Food is exorbitantly priced, with not many options too.It might be a good place for a couple but not at all friendly to family.I felt cheated, by choosing this place to visit in Dubai."

It is my recommendation to come early since the place gets crowdy around and after noon.Club cars are available free of charge along the sidewalk next to the beach. Highly recommended and easy transportation. If you want someplace calm you can walk down to the beach and find a place under a palm tree.Upon arrival we got an awesome reception by a guy called Bashir? (Forgot the name but he handled order ID: 208718). He really knows how to serve and explained all the information we needed to know AND the information we didn't know we actually needed. Very stand up guy! Lots of kudos to him.There are rides for all categories of people. If you like adrenaline or like to chill there is a ride for you. I strongly advise you to invest in a waterproof-pouch for your smartphone (bought one for 110 AED/22 EUR). That way you can record and snap videos/photos of all the fun.Food and beverages are available on the premises. Although pricy it was worth it. A bagel, fries and soda for 68 AED. Very good taste and quality so it was definitely worth the money. Since you can't bring your own food I would advise you to plan on spending that kind of money for food.All in all we are very satisfied with our visit and we will definitely come back. I want to finish with some tiny detail room-for-improvement feedback:1. The massive queue for taxi at the end of the day was less funny but I understand if it is out of your control. I feel for the parents with tired kids wanting to get home. Since everything was awesome it wasn't a big deal for us.2. The animation for your armband when geting in and out of your locker shows an arm go back and forth when it actually should be up and down to scan the bar code. We got frustrated a few times but it was good that you had personel just around the corner to help.3. My friend is a bit of a fraidy cat and it would be good if there was a grading system on the rides. I.e. Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme. :-)"

Obviously being at the very end of the Palms, the taxi fare would be a lot but we were lucky in that our hotel offered a free shuttle to it's sister hotel in the Palms and we just got a taxi from there. We got the Entertainer Vouchers prior to getting there (from eBay) so it was Buy one Get one Free for the adults. It is very expensive to enter so try to get the vouchers. Take your own towels if you do not want to pay for hiring them. The lockers are situated right at the very beginning of the park which is really annoying if u need anything. We left valuables in there and took towels/sunblocks and sandals and kept on a lounger. The locker system is a bit fiddly at first and the change rooms are a bit small for the amount of people visiting the park. There is hot water in the showers and 2 hairdryers in the ladies.I'm a massive adrenaline junkie so loved every ride! There are two massive 'temples' or towers where all the rides are on. Most have height restrictions so not for little ones. But the kids section is more than adequate for them. The 'Leap of Faith' is the most daring slide and def worth it and the Shark attack tube ride where you can enjoy the sharks and rays. I went on every one and loved it! Yes you do have to wait a bit to get on the rides and it does get chilly waiting to get on and some of the rides are electronically controlled and it is health and safety so can't complain. Food is not as expensive as I imagined. There is a meal deal at the entrance when paying for tickets, which is worth it. Plus there is a beach as well. Can't go to Dubai without a visit to Atlantis Aquaventure :-)"

It drops you down and if your over 6 foot like me slams your backside on the deck. I left with my turned purple. But that wasn't the worst. The poseidens revenge, a tube of terror. I got there and there was not one person waiting except a girl trying to get the Dutch courage to go. This should have been a warning, as no one goes on this ride more than once. This ride is a tube where rhe floor drops away. To make matters worse the scared girl pressed the button. After that all I felt was pain as I dropped foot first on free fall and smashed my ankle. As I winced in pain I was sandblasted by water in my face until the ride ended. 3 days later I still can't walk .

Take your own towels and walk to the far side of the park before you get changed because there is another changing room over there which is empty and new to some nice empty lagoons which form part of the lazy river. Otherwise you end up in the maddening crowds trying to get a deck chair. Awful.Food is expensive and they search your bags. If you stay in the hotel you can come and go as you please. The cost of food probably makes up for the extra cost in the room.Book your tickets the day before because you get a discount. Check groupon, they sometimes have offers. If you live here then emirates ID card gets you discount. Same with an EPC if you have one.Rides are good, the staff are excellent and seem to enjoy their jobs and always say hi and chat. As with most places in Dubai they are fantastic with kids.If your hotel is not on the palm, consider using the monorail which runs the length of the palm and takes you directly to the entrance. Otherwise it's a drive in bad traffic to a car park and shuttle buses anyway to get you to the same door.Make the effort to get there for opening time if you want your pick of seats to camp out."

If we go back we will def look into swimming with dolphins - looked like a much better quality experience than that in Florida that our friends have done and out us off doing when we went there. Although we haven't done it, if you are considering it, this might be the best place to do it from what we saw."

This place has the best lazy river ever, huge and takes a while to get round but really is not a lazy river at all! rapids and waves and lots of places to get off for flume rides. If you have a kid that is less than 120cm then beware they are very strict on height restrictions and it applies to all of the flume rides. My little one was stopped a couple of times as she is 119cm, no exceptions. We got round this by getting her to jump up and down shouting \"again again again\" she is a good swimmer so we were unconcerned about 1cm but fair play to them they have got rules."

Just buying the (very expensive) entry tickets was an ordeal--long, slow-moving line. I did not time the wait in line precisely, but it was close to 45 minutes.Inside at last! Locker rooms were spacious and clean. Strangely, though, no \"towel station\" near the locker rooms. Finally found a sign directing us to towels--and then beach chairs. The park is not that large; hence, long lines. Aside from the \"big slide\", the chief attraction is the raft (tube) ride--a meandering stream through the park and rather dull in comparison to other water parks we have visited. All-in-all, a good day, not a great day. Admittedly, the long wait to get to the ticket counter colored my mood--not to mention the cost of entry (but, after all, this is Dubai!)"

The park opens in the early hours and closes at 6.15pm. So, make sure that you reach well in time to enjoy the rides at leisure. The park is far. So, the travel has to be a combination of metro and taxi.You can book the tickets online to save up on a few dirhams. If you have seen better aquariums, dont bother to buy a combo ticket as it is nothing extraordinary.Other charges are as follows: Towel Rental: 30, Locker (Small) Rental 40, Locker (Large) Rental 75, Towel and Small Locker Combo 50. The small locker has a bare minimum storage so make sure you dont carry too much stuff.There are about 10 rides divided into two towers - Tower of Poseidon (about 4 rides) & Tower of Neptune (about 6 rides). All of the rides are great fun - seem to be safe and there is staff all over the park to assist you. The revenge of the Poseidon and the Leap of Faith were the two rides that had a few takers but make sure you do those even if you are scared as they are both an experience in itself, especially the Leap of Faith.All in all, great fun"

We had several goes however !Aquaventure works best and easiest if you are staying at The Atlantis (as you have immediate and free access)but waiting in line for admission tickets etc did not seem much of an inconvenience to those who had to and the cost seemed a worthwhile expense for a whole day if you were a casual visitor.The entire place is very clean, with plentiful facilities and sunloungers, many eateries and the abundance of Lifeguards ( who work in and out of the water) is comfortingI defy anyone of reasonable age who is game for a Waterpark day to not enjoy this place.

We decided to start off gently on a 'lazy river' type ride, where you sit in a huge rubber ring and gently follow the 'river' through the park. We found a two person ring and found one of the many entrances to the river. The next minute, our rubber ring is cajoled onto a conveyor belt, going uphill! Mmmm, can you see where this is going?! After a slow climb, we reached the peak, and lucky me sat at the front had a bird's eye view of what was to come, ... Yip a huge whoosh down and we were off, twisting, turning, and then having been plunged into pitch black continued twisting and turning, whilst gripping on screaming at the top of our lungs - not quite the sedate and gentle start to the waterpark, - but great bloody fun! We the continued on the not so lazy river, enjoying the various rapids and other rides, within the overall ride. More rides, one of which took us though a clear Perspex tube in a massive aquarium - I loved it. We did decide to skip the 'Leap of Faith' pretty much as it sounds - crazy fools push themselves of the edge of an almost vertical drop of a slide, where you reach speeds up to 60kph!! We did however, brave it and give all the others a go, - I don't think we've screamed or laughed so much. A great day out, for adults and kids alike."

There is a wide variety of super fun, super fast thrill rides and even a speed slide that goes through an aquarium. If your coming with children there is also a wide variety of more tame slides for the kids a huge wave pool and also a big circuit of rapids you float around Ina tube to pretty much every part of the park. If ur after a day of fun whether it be as a family or as a thrill seeking couple, then you must come to Aquaventure!"

The slide that goes through the shark pool , the leap of faith which is extremely high, some of the slides that push you upwards in a tube, the river rapids and torrents are all amazing. The views from the leap of faith are stunning so take your camera up there if it's water proof. The queues were quick when we went but allow several minutes to get back to the starting point as most slides end up in the river and take you on a ride to the end. The dolphin experience is ridiculously overpriced so we skipped it. The aquarium inside the Atlantis hotel is not really worth paying to see - give it a miss if you have seen some decent aquariums before."

First of all get some signage at the front - our driver dropped us off at what looked like a Chinese restaurant, it took us 5 minutes to realise this was where we went in! No directional signage whatsoever so we ambled through a Mall and eventually fell across the entrance to the water park. We asked meeter and greeter where to pick up our pre booked tickets and were ushered into a queue which was longer than the queue for buy your tickets on the day - brilliant so the fact we were organised and allowed the company to budget takings for the day was being penalised! Then we discover after 25mins queuing that we are in fact in the wrong queue - perfect and got sent somewhere else - cut a long story short it takes over an hour to get through the gate. Then we head to the changing rooms - now i am all for technology, i love my ipad, my mobile that takes pictures etc.. but computer controlled lockers where there are no instructions and only cleaners that speak the one language is a recipe for disaster and it was. So then we go out to the water and try to find a place to base camp from - and given this is January im assuming we can find at least a single sun lounger from which to stroll without the accompaniment of bags/ sandels /sunglasses etc.. apparently no we are relegated to a bolder at the end of a walkway from which to perch and store our things. We had lunch, it was ok the usual inflated prices you would expect but it was tasty so that was something, then we headed for the beach. Now i am not sure if because of the hype made around the palm or Atlantis itself if i was expecting a mirage of beauty or panacea itself but it reminded me more of Watford Gap services - the monorail kind of gives it that industrial logistical edge! Put it this way i would be gutted if my 12K a week room at the Atlantis looked out on that! So do i have anything positive to say... my thumbs up start & end here - there are plenty of lifeguards this is one thing they get right - you can be sure if you're little cherubs wander off/get into difficulty/act up they will be seen, they will be seen quickly and things will be ok with the world! Other than that i would say stay by your pool or try Wild Wadi!"

            "review": "Great Park but Overpriced and Unorganised. We visited Aquaventure, Atlantis on the 5th of January 2014, having purchased tickets online. We arrived by car and parked at Dolphin Bay Parking, which requires a Shuttle Bus to actually take you to the entrance. The parking is 25AED, unless you get your parking ticket stamped once you've spent over 150AED in food/beverages - what a rip off! While we were easily over the 150AED spending requirement (prices for food/beverages are very high!), we were at a water park and weren't looking to carry around a parking ticket all day. For the price you pay for entry, this is a rather ridiculous addition.Having purchased pre-paid tickets, we expected entry to be quick and hassle-free. Not so. We queued for over 45 minutes (we would've been faster in the General Admission queue), and the staff behind the counters were incredibly slow and unhelpful. As a previous reviewer mentions, it was CHAOS. The park was nowhere near capacity and still, the entrance was chaos!The slides were great fun, queues for each slide weren't bad at all and staff here were very friendly. Once you're inside the park, everything works well: there are shuttle buses to take you around, many of the slides actually have lifts which take you to the top inside your tube. The highlight for me was \"Shark Attack,\" a slide in the dark which ends inside an inner tube in a shark tank. Amazing!Overall, a great day out despite the entry/parking hassle, albeit a very overpriced one. There were 4 of us, and we spent almost 400AED just on food (we had 3 lunch sandwiches, and 3 fro-yo's combined). A great day out."

Entry was total chaos there was no control over the crowds and very few staff trying to help it was just a mad crush with people jumping queues and tempers getting very frayed. Once inside there wash't enough beds so people were using grass verges etc. The food outlets had massive queues and the quality was terrible. I've given a 2 as the rides were good albeit a lot of waiting. I'm sure at less busy times the park would be good but avoid during peak times."

The return journey was automated which negated the need to lug around the heavy tubes. The rapid river adventure was high quality and was lots of fun as it had many options to choose from. Entry was overpriced and small lockers to store gear were also quite expensive. From the lockers to the rides was a considerable distance and due to the Dubai heat, shoes are recommended for this as the pavement becomes scorching. It was good to see that plans were underway to extend the park as what was on offer was limited. Be aware that access by public transport combines Metro and taxi as this attraction is not in close proximity to other attractions."

Each of the 2 towers contain couple of water adventures, so you may have to claim up of each for several times to play them all. For those who fear the adventure you can have water rides. There're several simple rides, but fun along the way.There're lockers to rent with different sizes. I rent the biggest one and it cost me around 76 AEDUnlucky that we didn't have much time to play there, but it was a good experience and everyone of us went out with joy and fun."

It is still my favourite waterpark anywhere, thanks to the generous size of the park, a nice mix of slides and long lazy river - which includes some white water sections, and lush landscaping. It is well staffed and well maintained. The new tower adds some extra slides, including two family raft rides. If white knuckle body slides are your thing then this park still only has a few, and you would probably enjoy Wild Wadi more. Bring your own towel or be prepared to pay for one. Getting back from the Atlantis can involve quite a wait for a taxi (the monorail is pretty useless, as it is infrequent and does not connect with the main Dubai metro) but staff should be commended for managing the taxi line very well."

The slides were fantastic and really well laid out. I think we had at least one turn on every ride and had so much fun! The attendants and life guards were so friendly and helpful.....we could not have asked for better service. The food was typical theme park food, but not too badly priced and the staff were so lovely. We were very impressed with this place and would recommend it to anyone with kids over 120cm (height limit for many rides). Good value for money as we spent the entire day there and it is all the kids (14, 15 & 16) have talked about since. We took the free shuttle to Mall of Emirates which was a great way to end the day."

It was crazy..the first 5 seconds when you slide down 9 stories are amazing. Tower of Poseidon ( Four Amazing ride)Poseidon's Revenge. The Best ride i have ever taken. Its scary. One moment you are standing and the next floor open on you and you have a free fall inside a tube. Its an Ultimate experienceAquaconda and Zoomerango both are 6 person craft rides. They are fun and mid level thrill rides. Slitherine is a normal slide ride, found it to be better then the ones at tower of Neptune.If one know swimming Dolphin Bay is a must try."

We visited just as the The Tower of Poseidon opened and it didn't disappoint. The tube rides are ok, quite short but the slides are really good.I managed to cut my arm in one of the slides as I didn't have them in the correct position so I told one of the park supervisors and before I knew it they sent out a medic cart and cleaned it up and put a bandage on it. It was amazing to see the amount of care they have for the patrons, top service!For the adrenaline junkies the Poseidon\u2019s Revenge is amazing. The sense of feeling you have when the floor your standing on just disappears and you drop into the tube is insane. I managed to get some amazing footage of it with my GoPro.Then there is the lazy rivers which you can just chill on the whole day. Grab a tube and flow down the river and pick and choose the areas of the park you want to goto. The slide that goes through the shark tank is pretty cool and the slides that thrust you up and around the park are good as well.The food was reasonably priced and as expected at a theme park. Didn't find anything really to complain about. I have not been to Wadi Wadi so can't really compare the two."

Sadly, the Aquaventure water park was a real disappointment.Over \u00a3100 to get in, for two adults, 1 five year old and 1 1yr old who was free. I then was charged \u00a315 for the hire of a locker and 1 towel! Non refundable! A towel each would have been \u00a330, so we decided to share. The park it's self was ok, not particularly busy, but lots of people selling popcorn, candy floss, water squirters etc. We had a meal which was cold and tasted poor, and expensive! The rides were fine, fairly tame and not as good as wild wadi ( nothing was as good as wild wadi) I felt this was more about maximising the cash out of me as much as possible. As we left I was astonished to see a huge queue for taxis which after 45 mins we eventually got one. Hardly any taxis there so we literally were all waiting to get into cabs others had just left. The roads out and the entire infrastructure of the palm is not geared up to handling a major tourist attraction. Last time here, next time back to Wild wadi. "

This saddened me greatly and has knocked it from Excellent to Very good in my review.For those who arent raging alcoholics, you will have a good time and its better than Wild Wadi.Maybe give Yas Waterworld a go as well. You might love it."

Unfortunately my wife was concussed on a kids slide and ended up needing an MRI scan and seeing a neurologist in DXB in the midst of our holiday.The concussion was was obviously not the fault of the resort, but i would challenge the assertion that they had never had any such accidents before, as the neurologist at the Saudi German Hospital said she was the third patient of the day he had seen from the resort. The medical room in the waterpark did take care of her, and they provided complimentary return day passes.I am sure it is an enjoyable trip for the majority, but our experience is somewhat tempered by the fact there is no warning re adults on kids slides, and there are painful consequences."

There must be escalators or so. #For every water slide, you have to carry your tube all the way up. There must be automatic delivery of tubes.#Except the Leap of Faith, all the other slides are more or less the same with small modifications. Most of the part of the slides are closed which does not bring much fun. #The shark tank in either of The Leap of Faith and Shark Attack did not have visible sharks. The Leap of Faith scratched my back.#All the slides end in a common stream (kind of a lazy river) which ends far, and from there you have to go to the other end for other slides.There could be more advanced slides and RIDES."

For adults, it hugely fun, but i would suggest parents with toddlers or young children to go for the whole day and take your own food if possible.

In Orlando waterpark terms, Aquaventure is definitely the Aquatica [newer, smarter, nicer] but with some of the Wet'n'Wild [more extreme slide] rides."

Yes this place is full of tourists and its pricey but what else do you expect?Water slides are great, makes you feel like a kid again. Some of the slides make your heart come out of your mouth! (dont go if you have heart problem or pregnant) I would say this park caters more for older kids. Alot of the slides have height restrictions (min 1.2m). There is a special kids zone which we didnt go to so that might be ok however the main area is more for teenagers I would say.Leave a full day for this as by the time you try all the slides (once) and with all the queueing your day is pretty much over.Top tip - bring your own towel and dont bring any valuables.That way you dont have to rent a towel and/or locker. Note that you will also end up walking around bare feet - we were laughing at people doing so at the beginning but by the end we were doing it ourselves! If you are fussy about this then bring waterproof sandals that strap around your feet that wont fall off when on slide. Also bring change of clothing, i know, seems obvious now.......................but guess who forgot??All in all, great day out, must do."

Also the more extreme slides like Poseidons revenge is ridiculous, an almost vertical drop, serious adrenaline rush. I would recommend wearing sandals/flip flops to walk around or buying some of those beach shoe things as in the park they are so overpriced in the park.Food was as expected prices for a theme park. 50 dirhams for a shawarma, fries and a drink. 15dirhams for a can of iced tea 13dirhams for a bottle of water.Would definable recommend going!"

Even though we visited on a weekday, it was very busy. We arrived early, though, and had no trouble finding sunbeds. Certain facilities like the sunbeds seemed quite old and in need of renewal. The food quality and variety were great but the prices were very high for fast food (Dhs73 for a pizza, Dhs65 for a burger & chips, Dhs50 for a kids combo meal). We were not happy with the mocktails, it was just a cup of ice with very little to drink. For some attractions like the zipline (Dhs100) you pay extra. The lockers are an absolute rip-off, there is a non-refundable charge of Dhs40 for a small locker (compared to a REFUNDABLE 1 Euro/Dollar in other countries ....).We visited with a baby and a toddler and called beforehand to be sure that the water would be the appropriate temperature for them. We were told that the water is heated at 30 degrees. On our visit, however, the water was really cold. 27-28 degrees. We asked about 10 different employees. Lots of people were complaining, esp. parents. We were even told that this is a cost-cutting measure by the hotel \u2026\u2026. It is absolutely unacceptable for a family resort to provide an inadequate environment for children. By 15:00, my toddler had blue lips and was shivering. The water temperature should be 30 degrees throughout the waterpark and 32 degrees in the children\u2019s pool. We have raised this matter with the management and are awaiting feedback.We cannot recommend this waterpark to families with young children. The little kids can only go on the lazy river (fine even for a 1-year-old) and maybe on the rapids if they are a bit older (our 2-year-old found it ok). The play area is quite big and intimidating for toddlers with water being dropped down on them periodically from a huge bucket. Only on three of the slides, parents can slide with their children. Only 2 of these were ok for our kids. Atlantis is the only waterpark, however, (to our knowledge) that has single and double tubes with a child seat. These were absolutely fabulous. So, in summary, the waterpark is fantastic for anyone without children or with children taller than 120cm who will be allowed to do all the rides."

Take monorail there and back...nice view but great photo opportunity on approach to waterpark. Buy tickets in advance for waterpark, approx 25aed cheaper and saves queue time. Small locker can be shared as it is a good size.If eating on site u may want to consider buy food voucher in advance though it will only cost slightly more inside. Food is not ridiculously expensive as we thought it would be and portion is huge. Defo enjoyed it!!Queues for rides were long but not too bad considering it was a weekend. Sunbeds available all over and they were comfy ones with individual shades. Beach was gorgeous, view amazing.No restrictions on types of swimwear especially for women.Only negative thing is sign post can be confusing plus lack of them. Need more staff on hand.TIP: Go early!!! Take monorail from park and pick up cab at the other end...its quicker and a nicer way to end day otherwise taxi queue from park is loooooong!Bring yr own towel and drinking water. Keeps cost down. Have flip flops to wear around park...group is hot!!"

Overall we much preferred Aquaventure. We liked that the park seemed less closed in/more open. It was a lot easier to find chairs to sit in and in a better location than WW. Although we visited both at opening time and not on a weekend day WW was MUCH more crowded. The biggest drawback of Aquaventure is they have poor signage and no maps we saw so we ended up missing some of the attractions they did have (we later learned) that we would have tried. For us the rapids and conveyor belt system was better than the master blaster type rides at WW. The locker rooms are also nicer at Aquaventure. We would definitely return and spend the full day if back in Dubai. As it was we spent almost 4 hrs there and did only some of the rides. WW lines were long - we waited 30-45 for each. We never had a line that long at Aquaventure. No idea how the food compares as we did not eat at either. Prices with the Entertainer coupons are similar. Maybe a tad higher at WW with locker and towel rental as they did not have as packages and Aquaventure did plus we had a coupon for those."

In many ways Aquaventure is one of the best waterparks you will ever visit, but I did have one issue in that there aren't enough slides for the number of people visiting. The slides that are available are very good, and Poseidon's' Revenge where you drop through a trapdoor is the scariest thing I've ever experienced. The park is very well landscaped with lots of sun loungers, shade isn't to hard to find and the beach area is very nice indeed.

All the rides were great, however the capsule one did scare us to within an inch of our lives, defo most extreme water ride I've ever been on, and yes the floor is clear! Unfortunately only one of the big family rides was running so we'll have to test the other one next time. We then proceeded to hit all the other rides, which took almost all day in total, only stopping for a brief lunch of yummy corn on the cob. Queues certainly built up in the afternoon so best do the ring rides first then cruise the rapids in the afternoon. All in all a fab family day out, and worth pushing yourself to do the big ones.

            "review": "Really good day out Highly recommended. This is a great water park, a little bit pricey but what isn't in Dubai. We booked our ticket online from the UK and the prices were much cheaper than turning up on the door as there was a special offer on line so worth checking, remember to make a note of your reference when paying as this is the number you need when you turn up to get in, we never got an email confirmation or anything like that and as the wife didn't make a note of the number we ended up having to ring the park and ask for it.On arriving at 9.50 we made our way to the pre-paid ticket desk and were served straight away, we got out bands and then paid for towels 30 Dirhams each or one towel and a small locker for 50 Dirhams, the rest of the day was a breeze, floating along the easy river, through the fast rapids and hopping off along the way to go on the great rides, I could have floated around all day without a care in the world. There are ample sunbeds dotted at the various stopping off points along the river so there is no need to run in and dive on the first set of beds you come to.The day we went it was quite quiet and the queues for the main rides weren't very long at all in the morning, I went on the Leap of Faith slide and there was only 5 people in front of me (Men, remember to cross your legs !!! otherwise it will hurt trust me i forgot) the other rides are also great as well as some of the smaller rides along the river.Food in the park is as you would expect pricey, you are allowed to take your own water in to the park but nothing else and they will check your bags on entering, food for 2 adults and a child came to about \u00a330-\u00a340 but the portion sizes were good especially the BBQ chicken wings. Would also recommend getting the 50 Dirham refillable drink as this is large (1Ltr) and a refill is only 8 Dihams which by Dubai standards is a snip, we just left ours on under our towel on the sunbed and refilled it the next time we floated past.We had such a good day on leaving we took up the offer of returning the following day saving us 65 Dirhams each on the entrance price so we did it all again the following day, We could easily have spent a week in the park just floating along, enjoying the rides and the glorious sunshine.Ladies there is no restriction on swim suites either which was a question we had when we went given you have to cover up in a lot of places, but here its fine to wear a normal bikini.The only downside if you can call it that is actually getting away from the park if you need to get a taxi, the queues are massive especially if you are leaving from about 4 pm on wards (park closes at sunset about 5.30PM) we waited about an hour for a taxi as they come in dribs and drabs and there are both the normal marked taxis and also unmarked Lexus taxis which i presume are private hire cabs that the taxi officials call when the queue gets large, these will cost you about 50% more than a standard taxi but you don't get a choice as to what one you get you are pushed in to whatever comes round the corner next.All in all a great day out and highly recommended."

It turns out that I was charged the correct amount (no problem), but the staff person when I checked in wasn't the least bit interested in helping me clarify whether or not I had been ripped off a whole lot of money... the attitude was a bit disconcerting!Queues, queues and more queues simply made this bad value for money. In my country we have much smaller waterparks (we don't have a fixation and being bigger and better) where we pay less , we have less rides to choose from, but in half a day we ride many rides because when there is a queue it is managed well. On October 31st 2013 the Atlantis systems and staff simply could not deal effectively with queues that meant we didn't get to use many rides at all in half a day.My advice: See if you can find out in advance whether the park will be busy, otherwise you will spend a lot of money simply so that you can stand in a queue!"

The adventurous amongst us survived Leap of Faith and Poseidon's Revenge and the rides were longer and better than most parks. Food and drink overpriced and annoying that you are not even allowed to take in your own water! However, the big downside is the logistics if you don't have your own car. There is a monorail that takes you nowhere or taxis and we had to wait two hours for a taxi at the end of they day when the queue was over 200 people long!! Given the money they make, surely Atlantis could arrange taxis to arrive more frequently or shuttle buses to get people back to the mainland or nearest metro station?

We arrived midday so no sunbeds in park or on beach. We managed to squeeze in about 5 rides - no queue less than 30 mins and one major ride - aqua condo - was broken the day we went. My partners's 12 year old did love it but I wouldn't give up a day of a holiday for just a handful if waterslides again. We got the aquarium visit included and that was cool but didn't offset the hassle and still cost a tenner each.

You are not allowed to bring food into the park ( they say they allow up to 1ltr water) and food and drink is pricey, as this tends to be the case everywhere in the world when you're in a themepark.We started off getting a double ring to enjoy a round (or 3) through the rapids taking you all around the park and went on 2 of the bigger slides on the way. Grabbed some lunch in one of the food courts and then went down to the beach for some relaxation (great views across to the city) and some fresh melon. Overall a great day out of the city and in the sun without the stifling heat. Will definitely go again next time I visit Dubai."

I think we struck it lucky on the day we visited.The EID holiday had just finished and the Dubai schools had just gone back so therefore we did not have to queue for any rides at all.The park is beautifully clean with a lovely beach (watch out for jellyfish in the sea).The food court serves a good variety of food ranging from burgers to curry.Lockers are available,located by the entrance in the male or female changing rooms, so a long walk back if you forget something.The park has recently opened 4 new rides.The raft rides are great fun ,my 8 year old daughter kept wanting to go on them again and again.You should try the leap of faith....it looks scarier than it is! The lazy river/rapids circle the park and you can float round in your rubber ring for the whole day without finding the exit (a bit like the M25 but with water) .If you are not staying at the Atlantis be aware that there is a big queue for taxis on the way out and the Atlantis staff try to get you to take the limos starting at 30aed.My advice would be not to go Thursday afternoon,Friday or Saturday when the schools are off and to arrive when the park opens as it is an expensive day out,get sunbeds in a good spot , go on the most popular rides first and start at the farthest end of the park."

Even on busy days I didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes to get to a ride and the place is big enough that you never feel that it is too crowded. The rides are very interesting - some more enjoyable than others but it depends on your taste. There is a ride that takes you through an aquarium with fish and even sharks, it is really quite lovely to see the fish so up close and yet safely behind glass. My only tip is to go there early as there are lots of rides and the park itself is very big so you need all the time possible to enjoy all that the water park can offer as it always closes right before sunset which in Dubai is around 5:30 - 6 pm.Also, if you want to visit Dolphin Bay and meet the cute dolphins - just be aware that it is very expensive and afterwards, they keep \"milking\" you for more money by offering you the pics from your dolphin encounter but this is to be expected really.As an overall - great experience and I recommend this water park to everyone who is visiting Dubai!"

Having been to Yas Waterworld prior we were stunned by the vastness of the place- though it seems it is rather the distance between rides/attractions and the main entrance than the variety of rides. Very clean place. Not as many rides as Yas and not welcoming to travellers when wearing a t-shirt during rides...I found that petty and frankly ridiculous. Therefore I did not go onto any rides only the slow river. I was a bit puzzled to see the warning messages on the boards before one gets onto any ride- are they really that dangerous? We did not have to use the locker rooms or changing facilities as we rented a cabana. Cheaper (by 150 AED) than in Yas but not as luxurious. At the beach my younger son was snorkeling when we witnessed a little boy being stung by a jellyfish. That was the end of the beach experience for us as we had to leave the water. Food seemed overprized and the feeling was that this whole place is laid out to be a money spinner with too many tourists. They charged for every little thing. We left immediately once the waterpark closed as the restaurant prizes were off putting. There was a huge queue of people outside the entrance waiting for taxis...at least 45min wait."

We visited the Aquaventure water park in October 2013.During this time there was a religious holiday and the whole park was extremely busy.Barely a lounger could be found in the park after 10am, but plenty on the beach which was a 2 minute walk away.The water park is really well laid out with great fast rides for those wanting a bit of a thrill, or for the ones who just want to float, the lazy river is absolutely great - it has a number of rapids along the way just so you don't fall asleep in the sun.The whole park is spotlessly tidy and clean, much more so than any of the water parks that we have visited in the past (Florida mainly)Safety is obviously a prime concern for them, and a lifeguard is visible every 20 yards along the lazy river and plenty of other staff throughout the park.If your are planning a whole day there and there is a decent number of you going I would recommend the cabanas. They range in size & price, but you get a prime location and lots of space with loungers, seat, beanbags, tables and chairs to eat at, along with a gazebo to hide from the sun.As much bottled water as you need is provided along with ice and freshly cut fruit to keep you hydrated."

Poseidon's revenge and the Leap of Faith are the fastest rides whereas you can relax and enjoy the park riding around the lazy river (which has some fast bits) at your leisure. It is advisable to get there early to get a sun lounger close to the rides. However,we hardly spent 5min on the sun loungers as there was so much to do for us and my younger cousin.

The water park is smaller (in terms of rides) than most water parks I have been to in the USA. A good 5-6 hours can be spent easily in this park. The lines were not too bad with about 3-4 rides where there was no wait and 2-3 rides where there was about 30 min wait time. The best ride for me was the 'leap of faith'. The web site claims ' This slide will have you falling over 9 stories in a mere second before you find yourself speeding through a clear acrylic tube surrounded by sharks and rays. ' It was an experience to remember.The locker room was a huge bottleneck for the park. The management must do something about it and this could be as simple as providing multiple locker room facilities. It took our family 1.5 hours from the time we went by the lockers. This is not great when you are pressed for time and want to spend time enjoying the park. And the park closes at Sunset (approx 6 PM). The locker security system was a joke. Almost everyone was spending nearly 10-15 minutes trying to get the scanner to scan the barcode on your wrist. And there was a long line of frustrated people. I could not see any staff around to support the issues.You can use the coupons in Dubai Entertainer to buy one and get one free ticket.

I was lucky to spend a week with my family everyday at this wonderful world of water which provided endless hours of enjoyment for my children not to mention myself.There is adventure for all ages with the older children able to indulge themselves in more active and challenging rides.The whirlpools rapids and waves give you a constantly moving and changing set of twists and turns and a jolly good soaking.There are plenty of attendants to supervise and guide children in this adventure and parents can relax and chill whilst the kids play.We literally spent hours and hours there in the water with no sense of time or urgency we just went with the the ebb and flow of the adventure.The whole trip was not complete without the leap of faith totally breathtaking and i did it immediatedly on arrival to get it over with scared me to death but then i am a mere mortal whilst my children are superheros and my wife always right.One word of caution the sun is intense and make sure that everyone is well protected as time goes by so easily and your skin cant read clocks."

Ok, so this little experience, was a particularly pricey one, but I have to admit it, I felt it was worth it.We went during the week, so it was really quiet and we didn\u2019t really have to queue more than five minutes for anything.We started off on the new slide circuit where the Posidens revenge slide is and worked our way up to it starting off with the smaller ones. All the slides were pretty epic, but Posidens Revenge, really did take the biscuit! You stand in a sort of capsule thing, the door shuts, the guy presses a button, you hear a countdown and all of a sudden a hatch disappears below and you drop for what seems and eternity! You then feel all the water jets helping you pick up speed as you are propelled at around 70km ph through the tube slide, including upside down, until you are spat out into daylight, gasping for air, with the ultimate wedgy. I enjoy crazy rides, but I can honestly say I now think I know how it feels for a spider, when you wash it down the plug hole.FUN JEverything else was also really good, the aquarium was amazing and also well worth paying the extra few quid.Take your flip flops as the concrete gets very hot and they save your feet"

Warning: Lifting your bottom up out of the inflatable ring on the slides is very important otherwise you can easily bruise your bottom, as I found out! I wouldn't say suitable for kids under the age of 10 at least! Plenty of lockers and sun loungers and huge beach towels to use. Quite expensive at 100GBP for two adults but a fun day out none the less, you also get to see the Atlantis Hotel up close. Metro car not really worth it over to the Palm, cheaper and quicker in a taxi. Staff dotted every 50 yards or so around the park so felt very safe, they were all very happy and friendly."

I loved the rapids which takes a while to go round, but they're relaxing and a great touch to the park. The whole setting of the place is lovely, including the beach (although the sunbeds didnt have umbrellas!) and cafe's/restaurants. We bought the combo ticket for this and Lost Chambers aquarium, the aquarium I did not like as much, but price wise, I felt it was a good deal for a day out and what I would have expected to pay. Wish I could have done the dolphin experience, but was a little too pricey for my pocket!"

We then went onto the slides, we went on each one once then I went back to the rapids but my husband went round and round going on the slides over and over again. The Leap of Faith was terrifying, I watched it afterwards on YouTube and couldn't believe that I had managed to go down it! The floor is very hot but they do have some sprinklers to try and cool it down but we just had our flip flops and left them at the bottom of the slides for hours and they didn't move.

What I loved the most was not having to climb up stairs to go on the slides. You are given a giant rubber ring, you can have a single or a double ring for 2 people. They use a conveyor system so dont really have to get out of your ring if you dont want to.Remember to take towls although you can hire them there, at a charge of course. Also good to remember flip flops as the ground can get very hot, even just walking from your lounger to the water. Bikini's are ok for ladies to wear here and it's farly relaxed but if you are a couple do not show any affection such as kissing or the attendant WILL blow a whistle at you!A good day out if not a little pricey."

I went on a weekday in October and it was practically empty - I didn't have to queue for any slides for more than a couple of minutes! The park is easy to navigate with the use of the lazy/rapid river, which essentially takes you to each of the slides so you don't have to walk (also, it eases the queues during busy times). Most of the slides were ring slides - requiring either a solo ring, double ring or group ring. I prefer these types of water slides but if you like solo slides, this might not be the park for you.I plucked up the courage to go on the Leap of Faith (the notorious sheer drop slide that goes underwater into an aquarium) - it was definitely worth it! The food / drinks are what you would expect from any theme park / water park - overpriced and not that great, but this is something I've learnt to accept!It is also a great way to go and visit the Atlantis hotel which is amazing / slightly Disney-like! There are a number of restaurants such as Nobu within the resort which you could go to after.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my day at Aquaventure and I would return if I went back to Dubai."

I have been here once before, and did not really pay any attention to the resort itself...anyway, this time I went with a group of kids and young adults and have to say I was impressed. There are lifeguards everywhere. The whole place is clean and tidy. Some of the food outlets could be a little more organised of course, for a swifter service, and to get in appeared it could be a chore with no real 'fast pass' entry system for those who know what they are doing. The cabanas looked great and I thought were good value, and as a UAE resident we all got in for half price too, which was a bonus of course. You are allowed to take one bottle of water each, which I recommend you do at AED 15 for a small water. Food and drink inside is expensive, as is usual for these places. I also suggest you get there as it opens at 0945 at this time of year as queues to get in can be long. Finally, if you can, take your own towels as they are not free, they want AED 30 each for those too! All in all though, a quality attraction, lots to see and do, safe, user friendly, easy to find your way around, just note the comments which I hope are helpful."

Buy your ticket on the day at the park as the hotel reps will charge you extra as we found out with our Virgin rep which was really frustrating. It costs 250 AED per adult plus 50 AED for a towel and locker combo. You can take your own towel with you though. If you want to swim with dolphins it's extra... Women can wear normal bikinis and swimsuits although some rides can be sore on your back so you may want to take a tshirts/ rash top with you. It's definitely worth spending at least a day there.....

We'd bought tickets online and included a ticket to the Atlantis aquarium as well for an extra 50 Dirhams.The aquarium was great, lots of very impressive tanks with exotic creatures and a few small waterpools where you can touch starfish, crabs etc.The waterpark is accessed via the front of the hotel meaning you can wander through the lobby area and use the restaurants and shops.The park itself was great, a huge site with four or five rides. A massive water rapids route (think Centre Parcs times 10) where you go around on rubber rings through tunnels, rapids and more calm pools. The two big rides were great ( I wasn't brave enough to go on them but my boyfriend did and said they were brilliant). The almost vertical Neptune slide looked terrifying!There are quite a few areas with lots of sunbeds around them but when we arrived at about 11am they were all full and we struggled to find anywhere to sit at all. We eventually wandered over to the beach area a short walk away from the pools and slides and found some sunbeds which we moved into the shade of the palm trees. It was actually much nicer there as it was quieter and we could go into the lovely warm sea without lots of kids and rubber rings all over the place (I realise this makes me sound old and grumpy:-)There were lots of kiosks selling food, ice creams and drinks which were quite expensive but we expected that given it's a captive audience. You could also go back into the hotel to use the restaurants if you can be bothered to get dried and changed etc.The major downside is the changing rooms. There's lots of lockers (which you pay for) available. You are given a wrist band with a bar code to open your locker which was really hard to use and we spent about 10 mins trying to get it to open.The changing rooms were small, cramped, hot and not particuarly clean due to the sheer number of people using them. We stayed until the park closed at about 6pm and when we went back to the changing rooms it was madness. There were 9 showers for about a hundred people, one small area with mirrors, hand basins and two hair dryers! The women's changing rooms were just awful as there were so many people trying to shower, change, dry hair, do make-up and sort their children out. My boyfriend said the men's changing rooms were just as bad. This was a huge anticlimax to a great day. I can't imagine why they've only put 9 showers in for a park that size.We'd planned to stay at Atlantis for a nice meal after we'd finished at the waterpark but couldn't get a table in any of the restaurants as they were all full until after 10.30pm. I'd recommend booking a table when you arrive in the morning if you want to eat in the evening as with waterpark visitors and hotel guests everything was really busy. We ended up eating in the small Japanese restaurant which wasn't particularly fancy but pretty tasty. There was also a burger place if you wanted take away type food. "

Do the best rides first (earlier in the day) they get busier as the day goes on Food isnt great and really expensive - around \u00a330 for fast food for two. Maybe have a big brekkie and see if you can last or just get a snackEnjoy!"

The Aquaventure Waterpark in Atlantis The Palm Hotel is one of the best Waterparks in Dubai if not the best, the slides are great, it has a private sea but the water is super hot :p , it has an aquarium with possibility to swim with dolphins and/or sharks. To summarize, it's a great experience and a must if you're visiting Dubai."

We spent a day at the park and bought also the entrance for the aquarium, we didn't want to carry with towels and ended up renting them, keep a close eye on them because they can get stolen (we had ours stolen but we asked for another one and they kindly gave us another). It wasn't very crowded but it was a hot day, we spent most of the time at the kids area and my son loved it, he was 1.5 years old at the time, I have to say we also loved it. My husband went around in the lazy river with my son and it was about 40 mintues long, he also went in the big water slides and they were great. We spent some time in the beach, the water was so warm and you could go far from the beach and it wasn't very deep. When we changed the bathrooms were all clean and they provided shampoo, soap, hair dryer, pretty much anything you could need.The Aquarium was a nice thing to do after drying up and before going back to the hotel, it wasn't very big but it has nice decorations and loved the little story. If we would have had another day I would have definitely been back."

After going on 3 or some what rides we questioned staff if there was more rides around as it all pretty much looked like the same principle and then he stated out that there are only 7 rides in the water park and we were shocked as we came to have fun. Also because they have so little rides the queues went on for ages and its so frustrating in that heat. The food and water was so expensive. A small bottle of water will cost you AED13 where in a supermarket it will cost you AED1 and a small locker here was AED40. The only good thing about this was the beach, but be careful in August as there was loads of jelly fish in the water but there was a life guard warning the public about them and walking around with a bottle of vinegar in her hand a couple of people got stung so I didn't dare stay in the water too long. Bring flip flops as it is so hot that you cant walk bare footed at all. To conclude this review if I was you I would miss this and just spend your money in Wild Wadi theres like 23 rides there and you will have so much more fun believe me on that one!"

I was in the city for business and was looking to 'clear the head' for an afternoon with something different, relatively easy to get to and active whilst not strenuous.The park has a great selection of waterslides and water coasters, one of the coolest features being that once you have an inflateble tube you pretty much don't have to get off it. There are even conveyor belts that take you from the river that circles the park up to the top of the water slides and coasters.There is a speed slide through a shark filled tank and a waterslide that also gives you an up close look inside the same tank.The river that goes right around the park varies from a slow, smooth pace to rapids and waves. It is a lot of fun.The property has beach access to the waters inside the Palm Jumeirah and is in the shadow of the impressive Atlantis hotel. A mono rail leads straight up the 'trunk' of teh Palm and delivers you right outside. You can also drive or catch a cab.IMHO - Just great fun that is well worth the effort."

It was very difficult to know which you slides you needed an inflatable ring for, and which you didn't. Attendants weren't particularly helpful. When you did need a ring, you had to search for one at the bottom of a Slide, fight others to get one and then carry it up the steps. The part I did like was the fact that most of the larger slides were connected and you could stay in the water and get carried around the lazy river, up ramps up to the next one. Food was expensive, but it's always the same in these places."

With complimentary entry from the Atlantis hotel, we visited the park everyday.Getting there earlier is definitely worth the effort as it does get busier in the afternoon. The wider availability of kids tubes was a big bonus for our kids and we were amazed to see how few lines there were."

            "review": "NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE. I am still pondering what to do about my recent family trip to Aquaventure. My mum and other members of my family came to visit me in Dubai and the kids wanted to go to Aquaventure... off we went despite the huge expense: 8 people for the waterpark; 3 of them for Dolphin experiences and the other 5 of us paid extra for passes to observe the Dolphin interactions, not to mention x8 people eating at the buffet restaurant after the day's 'fun'. Firstly, we had 3-4 packets of crisps in our bags that were removed by security and we were unable to reclaim them. Plain annoying!So, off we go onto the rings that float around and we come to 'the rapids' - well, mum was tipped upside down (she can't swim) and was dragged and thrown about under the powerful fast-flowing water for the duration of 'the rapids' - ahead of her I had no idea what had happened until I looked back and heard cries of 'help me, help me' - and I saw her distraught face resting on the side of my friends ring as she was being supported by them to keep her head above water. THEY SAVED HER LIFE. Despite all the 'lifeguards' you see dotted around nobody came to her rescue. We got her out of the water ASAP and asked the 'lifeguard' (who did nothing when he was needed) for a buggy - he said it wasn't possible and we should just walk down the 'river' \"it's a lazy walk.\" Still in shock and unsure how much water mum had swallowed etc, we just did it. Panicking at the thought of being in the water at all, it was awful for her. So, as we're walking (mum is in a ring I am pulling as she was having difficulty walking) another 'lifeguard' says \"you can't go that way\" so in no uncertain terms I tell her 'Yes we are.' We come to the end of the 'river' and again ask a lifeguard for a buggy as the floor was scorching (ridiculously hot and impossible to walk) - surprise surprise, request denied again. As a diabetic with unknown injuries this was another ridiculously frustrating challenge - but again, we had no choice but to walk on fire hot ground - mum SCREAMED in agony and had to take refuge near a kiosk whilst I ran to get footwear. We finally get to sit at a cafe area and mum thinks her toe is broken, and by a stroke of luck a pleasant employee was nearby who organised a buggy to take her to get checked out at the medical centre, etc. Meanwhile we realise we're just about to miss the Dolphin interaction appointment. I called to explain what happened and they said \"we'll call you at the medical centre,\" was obvious they wanted to verify the story first! Eventually, x3 Dolphin interactions were re-scheduled for the following day but the other 5 of us who paid app. 20GBP extra each to observe would not be allowed to re-schedule, but we were most welcome if we paid the 40GBP per person waterpark entrance again!!!!! WHAT!?Manager of the waterpark attends the medical centre and the most pressing question I had was: \"Why did the lifeguards not help her?\" He said he'd have to do his investigations and get back to us. Along the traumatic journey after the accident, various staff were rude, found the situation funny and sniggered - and the manager was more interested in that than why vital lifesaving did not happen. All in shock at this point, we get out of there as quickly as possible (mum via buggy).Later that day the manager calls to ask if 'Madam' was OK? She was in pain, and had aches and pains all over - but to be frank we all tried our best to steer her to the positives - she was still alive! I asked him what went wrong and he said the 'spotter' (mistaken as a lifeguard) did see a lady to come off but failed to inform the lifeguards and he had been disciplined and due to safety reasons 'spotters' are not allowed to enter the water their as it is dangerous!!!!! DISCIPLINED! Not even fired, I am shocked. What if it was a child???Two weeks later and mum is having panic attacks and the next day woke up with horrid cuts and bruises, some of which have still not healed due to being diabetic. Mum wants to take it further, which I have been reluctant to do knowing Dubai (I broke two toes on the Dubai Metro and was not even able to officially file a complaint).What to do? For now, inform as many people as possible. If you take young kids best to get a lifejacket as next time Atlantis may not be so lucky to get away with such negligence."

The Tower of Neptune Waterslides are all great fun, but you do need to collect a ring from the bottom and clim to the top, which you don't have to do in wild and wadi, the shark attack ride, is fun, as the bottom part goes through a clear tube in the sharks tank full of rays and tropical fish.

You can hire towels and lockers at a price. The lockers are not conveniently located - they are near the entrance but nowhere near any of the sunbeds or attractions so if you need to return the lockers for any reason its a bit of a trek. You can pre-load money onto wristbands to spend on food and drink in the park and then get reimbursed any unspent money from the Refund Desk on your exit. The lazy river with rapids is great. We also enjoyed the rides but as the day went on it just got too busy. Very long queues started to amass, the floor is burning and it was just too hot to hang around waiting in queues. The water was not particularly cool, so it wasn't exactly refreshing when you took a dip - it was more like getting into a warm bath. We noticed that some new rides are being built, not sure when they open but I am sure they will be an improvment as, to be honest, at the moment they're are not that many rides to enjoy, bearing in mind the huge size of the park. We visited Aquaventure for a day last year during Ramadam and we more or less had the park to ourselves, it was bliss. This year, not during Ramadan, it just became unbearably busy for us. If we left our sunbeds, we would return to find other people sitting on them and not minding at all that they were sitting wearing wet clothes on our dry possessions. If we return in future, it would definitely only be during Ramadam when things are less hectic as its an expensive day out if you end up not 100% enjoying it."

The water seemed to be slightly warmer than body temp, I would have wished if the water was slightly colder. The most disapointing fact was that smoking was prevalant in all areas of the park. The rule is that smoking is allowed near the blue ash trays which were already distributed throughout the park and not in isolated locations. It was normal to find people walking and smoking between childeren infront of park attendants!! I asked attendents twice why they are not upholding smoking regulations, the answer i recieved in both occasions was that people get mad when we ask them to stop smoking!!"

            "review": "Great but could be better - full review. I tried to find out how this place actually works by looking on the Atlantis website, but couldn't really find out much information, so here is a full review of exactly what to expect, to help my fellow water park goers. 1 - The parking area is set away from the park. You have to pay for parking and then get the shuttle bus back to Aquaventure, which is located in the Avenues area of Atlantis.2 - Try to get an Entertainer voucher as it's not cheap! Also, and no one told us this, and it's not clearly noted anywhere, you can pay in advance for any food and drinks inside the park, and the credit is given to you by way of a wrist band. This way you don't have to take cash with you and don't have to worry about your wallet coming out of your pockets while on the rides. Each time you buy something, your wrist band is scanned/deducted with the cost of the item, then at the end of your visit, you get any cash back that you have not spent. You cannot take any food or drink into the park so you will be spending money inside.3 - You can get a locker inside for your valuables/bags etc. You can also rent towels if you don't want to lug your own all the way to the Palm with you. The lockers are located at the entrance and are in both the gents and ladies areas.4 - I highly recommend some form of footwear. The ideal foot covering are the little wet socks - I have no idea what they are called, but they sell them in the park, and I'm sure you can get them before you go from any sports shops. They are like little booties (same material as a wet suit) with a rubber bottom. There is a bit of walking to do between rides/entrance, and the pathways are not clean/not even, plus they are ridiculously hot (especially walking up the steps to the main rides) so expect your feet to get burned! The management really should do something about this as it's not pleasant. I wore flip flops, but you have to remember where you left them, and there is no guarantee they will be there when you get back!5 - There are sunbeds everywhere and there is a beach with lots of sunbeds. These are included in the entry fee. If there is a group of you, I would recommend taking all your stuff, and grabbing a few sunbeds - then using this as your base camp while everyone goes off to enjoy the water attractions. In a larger group there are always people staying at the sunbeds so you can take it in turns to watch your stuff.6 - There is no place in particular to get your floaties for the lazy river/rapids. You have to just 'find' them in the water. This was bothersome, as it took us some time to get ours. Once you get it, hold onto it!!! You have to take your own float to the water slides, you cannot get them there - seems a bit ridiculous to me but there you go. You can get a single float, or a double. They also have floats for small children. These have a 'seat' in them, so the child can't slip out the bottom.7 - There is not much variety on the food and beverage, and they are all expensive. A small bottle of water is AED 13 (at time of writing) and a chocolate ice lolly was AED 20.8 - There are changing rooms with showers and hairdryers (in the ladies at least :-))9 - When you leave, there is no obvious place to get the cash back from your wrist band. We had to ask a couple of people who pointed vaguely to one counter or another. At our third request, we were asked to go to the 'Hotel Guest' window, where our refund was given. Why not just have a window labellled 'Refunds'.10 - It is very hot when you are in the bright sunlight - sounds obvious, but you may think that being in the water you will not really get too hot. If you are sensitive to the sun, wear a t-shirt or some kind of waterproof top, as you are burning without realizing it while you are floating along the lazy river. There are a few shady areas on the route, but not many, so each is a welcome reprieve from the sun. Management - how about some of the cool air misting machines in the tunnels?11 - All in all a very enjoyable day and my 14 year old niece loved it."

The summer promotion of the discount for residents makes it more \"value for money\". My kids liked the lazy river a lot, even though we were not allowed in the rough parts. The kids slide/pool area does not cater properly for all age groups and I even found it dangerous for my 2 years old, there should be something for each age group there. My 4 years old enjoyed the slides a lot, the sudden flow of water on your head was not very much appreciated and the stream is quite strong even for an adult. Fastfood was available inside despite of Ramadan (whish was good for our hungry kids) but the food and drinks are severely overpriced even for Dubai. It is a good place to spend a hot day as you can be in the cool water all the time."

So far we go early (10am) to avoid the crowds and que less for the big rides ie Leap Of Faith. Only my 9 year old has had the guts to do that one so far! The kids splash pool is excellent for little and big kids alike. Most of the rides you will be in floats, which is handy as you don't have to keep getting out of the water, also keeps you cool. It is expensive for food and drink also lockers are about \u00a38-10. Towels are available to all. It could do with some more rides and also some water coolers/ sprays to help people stay cool in the heat. Early evening is also less busy as people not staying at the hotel make their way home . Wild Wadi is better although obviously if you are a guest at the hotel it is definitely worth going."

It is the largest waterpark as it is 17 hectares in area and has it's own beach access.

We spent about half a day here, and chose it because it was part of the Atlantis Hotel, which we wanted to see as first time visitors to Dubai. The entry fee is not really cheap, but we found nothing was in Dubai! It is still definitely worth going to. The park is very clean, beautiful and we had so much fun riding all the water slides. I haven't been anywhere like this in about 6 years but think you are never too old! The Leap of Faith waterslide is a must do - pretty scary as it is almost a vertical drop but an amazing experience! If you hire a locker, be prepared for it to be somewhat annoying trying to unlock it - you have a wristband you have to scan, and mine was faulty. Then at the end of the day, I realised it had fallen off probably on a waterslide, so had to get staff to open it for me which took a little while. Next time we go to Dubai we would like to try Wild Wadi, but I would recommend this one to everyone! I also got great photos from the top section of the highest waterslides as there are views of the city, sea and surrounds. Loved it!"

That is until the portion arives. Top Tip... Buy the souvenir cups and spend AED8 per refill, instead of spending AED18 per coldrink.

Apart from being very expensive for all extras (food, lockers, ray feeding) - the waterpark is fantstic place for fun in the water for small, big and grown up children:-).Don't understand complaints on lacking plastic tubes - there are hundreds of tchem floating empty in the lazy river - just to pick up as many as your family needs. There singles, dubles with two holes and doubles with one hole and the other part with baby seat for small kids.They allow kids over 120 cm on all big slides (including the Leaf of Faith going steeply down to the shark tank). Smallest kids must stay in kids' pools (also fun, ut limited space). If you have kid just slightly over 120 - ask for permanent blue wrist band (they have tchem in the office), you will avoid measuring at every enetrance to the slide and every mid-gate at the lazy river, saves a lot of time and arguing as some of the Staff are judgemental (they don't want to risk, so didn't want to let my daughter in, despite her being 122 cm tall.It's great that entrance ( and skipping the entering line) is free for hotel guests - just ask for the wristband at the hotel - in the Imperial Club reception for its' guests and at the entrance for the other guests. You don't feel preassured t stay in the waterpark for the whole day this way - we were going every day of our stay for 2-3 hours and that felt just perfect.Have your flip flops handy when going in hot months - in July walking without them between attractions in the park is practically impossible unless you are an Indian fakir :-)."

But what steals the show is Leap of Faith. A suggestion: Do not try the Leap of Faith at 1st hand, otherwise you will lose interest in other rides.We got some kind of discounts(though I do not remember how mush) in our ticket to Aquaventure which includes the locker cost, the towel price and also includes a snack.The usual rapids, which is common in other water parks also, are quite comfortable. There are guards all along the rapids and so do not worry. The park itself is large. One of the major attraction as I remember was Shark Attack, which is actually a tunnel ride through a lagoon full of sharks. But the slope was soo steep and you have to move with such momentum (read it high) that it was quite challenging to notice the sharks while you are in flow.Now come the best part \"Leap of Faith\". It's one of the steepest slopes and once you start the fall, the adrenaline rush you feel is unimaginable. But you will enjoy it to the fullest. So it's a must try. Now if you are afraid of heights and do not want to try Leap of Faith, just do not go to Aquaventure. It's a waste of money.We got a soft drink can and a Ceaser Salad as our free snacks, which was satisfactory in terms of taste and was quite a large proportion in terms of quantity.Ohh I forgot to mention, if you are upto people watching, it's a great place to enjoy."

The big draw is the Leap of Faith slide. It's intense and not for the faint of heart. However, my sons (ages 10,13) were disappointed by the other slides. At first, the park appears to have many slides; but you soon realize that they're all very similar and end up in the same lazy river.Unlike Wild Wadi, the pools are not cooled, and the walkways are not watered to spare burning feet. Also unlike Wild Wadi, there's no wristband payment system, so you have to carry around cash. It's a pain.If you can only visit one waterpark in Dubai, we'd recommend the Wild Wadi. But it's certainly hot enough in Dubai to enjoy two waterpark days!To see photos and get other ideas of what to do with kids in Dubai, you can check out our blog at www.aroundtheworldin72days.com."

The water park is fun for people of all ages, it will bring out the inner kid in you in a fun way! I went there on my own and did not feel weird at all, the staff members are very friendly. I highly recommend it especially for the adrenaline junkies out there. Make sure you get on the lazy river and stay on it during its entire cycle, it is very very relaxing!"

There are no cooled shady areas to get any respite from the heat unless you are prepared to stand in the toilets! All sunbeds have canopies however even lying still under them you will be dripping in sweat. We got there early (it opens at 10) as we were advised by our hotel to be out before midday due to the heat. It was not crowded at all but all the water was very warm and the water flow was slow which meant that you were exposed for long periods to the heat, humidity and warm water whilst on the rapids. My family actually got off their donuts at different points as they could walk faster through the water than ride. We managed 2 hours but all left seriously overheated. Go early or very late, you need plenty of water and sunscreen and they definitely need to provide more shaded areas. Feedback from my teens were that the rides were \"ok\" - they were not stunned by the park though and glad to leave. Very nice frozen yoghurt stand as you walk back through the hotel! Towels and lockers cost extra."

Unfortunately for us, our kids are borderline on the 1.2m minimum height for the majority of the rides. There are obviously some options for the younger kids, but it does limit you in terms of the overall experience. Invariably, my wife and I had to take turns on the \"bigger\" rides (so one of us could be with the kids), which then did not give us the best experience as a family. There are also some rides that require \"double\" seating, which we did not do, as we would not leave our kids alone. It is a small negative, but a consideration for younger families.All in all, the park is well maintained, and the staff were very good in the interactions we had with them. I would consider returning, but when the kids are bigger and we can enjoy the full offering of the park."

It would be better if they were outdoor which is easier for families and couples to share the same locker. The lockers are electric and are to be opened using a wristband which is programmed. But instead of scanning your wristband at your locker you need to scan it at a central location then go to your locker. Also the lighting in the bathroom and changing rooms was so dim. They need to put brighter lighting. They also do not have enough showers in the bathroom, which could get annoying when you have a long line in front of you.

I don't mind paying a lot of money if it the value is their. There are only like 5 rides!! You can get bored really quickly! And then on top of that, the food was really expensive for no reason! It wasn't that great. It's a small park you can go on every ride in less than an hour. And as a guest(not staying in the hotel) you are restricted all over the park. I was bored too quickly after paying all that money to get in the park and then eat and buy an OVERPRICED souvenir. Another thing that I got annoyed by was that the monorail on the palm from Atlantis to the city leaves you in the middle of no where! If you don't have a car you will be stranded!I'm glad I went though because there was a few things I did enjoy. The best part is that you get to be on the actual Palm Island and you get to see how cool that island is! It's really fascinating. When you on the monorail you get a nice view of the island. That was really cool. Another thing I enjoyed was the beach! The beach was beautiful safe and calm. I love the beach at the Atlantis. It was really great. No waves and very calm an a also a great view, great for pictures.

There are many fun rides, some very exciting ones and some dare-devil types!! There are food corners all over the park, selling snacks, fruits (cold watermelon and pineapple - very nice presentation!!), frozen yoghurts and merchandise!!"

I was so excited to visit atlantis hotel water park and was a little disappointed.We got a platinum day pass which included food, locker, towel and cups to re fill for 5d. The rides were fun but very quick. The best bit was going up the escalator in a rubber ring. The rapids were boring there wasn't enough water so you didn't flow and then when you wanted to go towards the escalator the water was so slow you had to get out and walk through low water, a bit like a trench. The reason I thought it was lacking was the amount of flumes. I have been to water parks in America and they are 10x better then this park. I did however love the beach pure white and warm sea was incredible. You couldn't go in the hotel which was annoying as we hd heard great things about the inside of it. If I go again I will be paying the lowest price as i feel personally it wasn't worth it."

Once inside was a bit hard to find a seat but we ended up down on the beach where seats were plentiful. The rides were great fun and we did most of them without long periods of time waiting had a blast then found a lovely place for lunch good standard of food for a water park nice fruit salad and you could even get a shisha. Definitely would go here if you had children they would love it and it is very well organized with plenty of life guards in attendance. There are lockers available to keep valuables and change of clothes which we took advantage of and if you are a big group you can rent an individual cabana for an extra cost if hot this would be a good idea. Definitely enjoyed our day here and would recommend but it is a busy place be prepared."

Some pointers:1. Make sure you get your double-seater floater if you have young ones as they run out very fast2. Get wet shoes for you and your kids. they are very convenient as you can swim and walk with them. Ground would be scroaching hot3. Location, location, location! the best places to book your recliners are near the kids water park. again they get filled up pretty quickly so you better be early4. Best time to go there? Probably end Sep-end Oct and Feb-April as the weather would be ideal in Dubai5. If you are up for it, you need to try the \"leap of faith\" ride. This one is REALLY scary and I am not just saying that to scare you!"

Didn't like the huge queue to pay for entry, but once we had paid it was easy to navigate the park. Really liked the fact that there are more than enough tubes for everybody and some of the double tubes have a base so children can sit in it rather than falling straight through. The lazy river was great and even our 8 month old grandson enjoyed it. We were fortunate to get 3 sun loungers for the afternoon, but they are very popular.there is definitely something for everyone.We paid for visiting the aquarium too and again it was well worth it. The monorail runs up until 10pm so there is plenty of time to do everything without feeling rushed.On the downside I didn't think there was much choice for eating in the evening."

The Zigurrat or the Mayan pyramid is the main attraction for thrill seekers. It has 7 rides spread across 3 levels. The Leap of Faith is an absolutely amazing thrill. Going at this time of the year, it can get pretty hot so be sure to carry sunscreen.Overall, the waterpark was an absolute joy and I'd love to return and explore it in its entirety."

To be honest, I found the Leap of Faith ride a bit disappointing, as you travel through the shark tank too quickly to even realise you're there. That said, the drop itself was fun. The Shark Attack lazy river offered a much better alternative to see the shark tank properly. Also many of the rides seemed to have a strange obsession with you being in the dark the whole time, meant that a lot of them felt very similar. Having said all this, rides like Shamal and Shark Attack more than made up for these relatively minor grievances."

The frozen yogurt on the other hand was delicious! Staff were very friendly and playful with all the guests which helped create a lovely fun atmosphere. They have the longest Rapid ride I have ever been on, about an hour I would say. if you go all the way around sort of turns into a lazy river; would save this too last!

In fact, we were surprised that AV being newer didn't have better rides in comparison. Although AV has some great themed rides, going through the fish/shark tanks, the rides themselves were not as fun/exciting as WW. (We gave WW a 4 star rating)AV is a great experience, however is a bit more expensive than WW because of food costs and the cost of the monorail. That said, we thought it was worth it. Simply going out to Atlantis and AV was fascinating in the monorail with its great views of the man made islands and its neighborhoods, beaches and waterways. If you have to choose between AV and WW and care about the overall experience, go to AV. If you only care about the rides for their thrills and not their aesthetics, go to WW. Or better yet, do what we did and go to both. Its worth it."

The price was abit steep (we are students), but hey its Dubai, we kind of expected it.It is really enjoyable, our four hours there wasn't enough for us."

When you reach the hotel, you park in a designated park, and then you go by a shuttle bus to the hotel, where you go inside and purchase the tickets.We bought our tickets online, it was a combo ticket for Aquaventure and the Lost Chamber, and that saved us around an hour standing up in a line to buy tickets, where we went to an empty window, gave them the online reservation number, and they just checked it on the system. All the slides require a tube, which you can take any empty one you find, except for the leap of faith slide, which we did not try. All other slides were really really nice, and they end up in the river, which was also really fun.You can find many kiosks for snacks or sandwiches, but they are not cheap."

Food left alot to be desired, but to be expected at this sort of attraction, especially after dining at the One and Only on the Palm for the rest of the week! dont know if its value for money as we were given complimentary tickets by our hotel, but we had a great day, just expect a serious wedgie if you take on the \"leap of faith\"!!!!"

Inner tubes are provided but if you're an adult make sure you get one without the bottom - we had a friend who had to learn the hard way after his kept flipping over. The park itself is clean and there are a decent amount of small eateries scattered throughout. If you don't bring any towels be ready to pay a hefty price for rental (this is Dubai after all).If you're able to, make sure you flag down the attendants with the scanners as many times as you can so that they get photos of you throughout the water rides. The people who work there are very friendly but one word of warning. We had an accident while we were at the park - there are points in the lazy river where it turns into rapids and one of our friends had a very nasty spill that cased his head to be gashed and pretty severe damage to one of his fingers. There was an attendant standing in the water helping visitor who had fell out of their tube - our friend crashed into him and he got thrown into the water and hit his head on the floor. So be mindful of your surroundings and watch for other people in the rapids. I will say, however, that the people were incredibly attentive and they followed us all the way through the river until we were able to exit where a medic was ready and waiting to help bandage my friend up. Another bit of ride advice regarding the leap of faith. when you get to the end of the ride the exit tube is fairly long so make sure you don't start taking breathes otherwise you'll start sucking in water. All in all a very good time was had. Well designed park. Clean, fun, good times."

At some points she was okay and then after queing she was told that she could not go. This caused annoyance and they can have better system. The rides were lovely but it can take time to find a float for a child. Rapids are a must and children play area is lovely. Even I Enjoyed it. A few small improvements could make it much better day for family. Lifeguards were great and very friendly. My son loved it so much we went for all 4 days that we stayed there.

When deciding whether to visit Aquaventure or Wild Wadi I based the decision to go to the former purely on basis that it was located on the Palm and this was something I really wanted to experience.We got a taxi from our hotel in Bur Dubai to Atlantis for 70AED including tip and were dropped right at the door. You go through a mini mall style entrance before the opening to the water park. We had already booked online which I think saved us a couple of pounds, but certainly cost us in time; we joined a separate queue and there was only 1 person serving and about 10 people in front of us, we would have been better just queuing from the outset which is a shame as you would think they would want to encourage people to purchase in advance especially on a busy day, we went on a Sunday so it was reasonably quiet.You are offered to purchase locker rental for the day, which at this point you do because you want your belongings to be safe, however in hindsight it is a waste of money and you could easily keep your things by your sun lounger as many people did.There are plenty of sun loungers for all, and they are very comfortable with the little canopies, so you can protect yourself from the sun if you wish.What they don't warn you about before you head off in giddy excitement is that the floor will be hotter than the core of the sun, and if you attempt to walk without flip flops you can expect your feet to blister up and die, and this is what happened. Take your flip flops and leave them near the slides so you can easily get to them afterwards, as less time spent with foot to floor means more skin on your feet at the end of the day.The rides certainly look impressive, however they are not. They are very average and apart from the Leap of Faith, they aren't terribly exciting. We went to a water park in Zante a few years ago and we went on every ride so many times that we never had time to sit down and relax, at Aquaventure I read my book and had a 20 minute doze, so do not be prepared to be thrilled. They have a water rapids which is meant to whisk you around, in fact we found from one of the lifeguards that they had slowed it down completely because too many people fell out of their rings; we also fell out of our ring because we had to push it round because it was so slow and boring.One redeeming factor was the beach which park users had access to. It was a very beautiful beach, very warm water with exceptional views of Dubai. The reviews for WIld Wadi look better, so I would go there and visit the Palm to go to a nice restaurant, not Aquaventure."

Allow extra time for parking up in the car park, getting the shuttle bus to the hotel, and then walking to the park. Allow extra money for a locker (a large one will do 2 of you {same sex, obviously}) and give yourself at least 6 hours to do everything, including queuing. Have taken teenagers to the park twice now, and both times they have been exhausted at the end, and not up for much more than fast food and an early night. Leap of faith looks scarier than it actually is, so a lot of the long queue is repeat business. Everything else is suitable for all ages, but there are height restrictions (1.2 or 1.3 m?) on some rides."

Dispite of that we decided to take our car and enjoy a day at the Aquaventure. I tried to find parking instructions from the web but couldn't find any. We drove to the parking area, left our car and tried to find the park. There were no instructions or signs anywhere. Suddenly a security guy instructed us to take a shuttle bus to the waterpark. I asked is there a valet parking somewhere since we had prams and a small toddler and got no for an answer. When we arrived to the entrance, there were at least 5 valet parking guys waiting for cars...After enjoying the Splasher area, we decided to have lunch and walked quite a long way to the Barracudas restaurant only to find out it was closed. I asked them how hard can it be to place a small sign saying the restaurant is closed before people walk half a kilometre to get there. They instructed us to go to the Sharks Bite restaurant. We went there only to get cold hamburgers for 50 dirhams which we had to change because they were honestly ice cold. The next ones we got were just plain tasteless. Probably one of the worst dining experiences ever. Also the price of water is ridicilous, 13 dirhams per bottle. The good thing about this aquapark is the Splasher area for smaller kids and beautiful surroundings. However dining and service was way below average. Would I go back there? Definitely not. We will rather test all the other waterparks in UAE first."

The rides are great and there is also a private sandy beach with sunbeds that can be used during the stay. The water was warm and there was a rather short waiting time for the slides as the park is quite large and well spread out. It is possible to enter many of the slides as well as the rapids form different entries whic results in less waiting time. The prices are similar to the other parks and the food is preety much the same standard fast food but the quality is ok. The rides are excellent and some of them quite fast and exciting. The park provides a next day ticket at a reduced rate if you want to go again. One turnoff was the parking which is quite far away from the entrance and you have to take a shuttle bus. We also waited in line for an hour to purchase tickets to enter the park as only 5 counters out of 12 were open which was rather annoying."

If you're staying at Atlantis, it's included in the price. That means you can pop down any time, rather than queue with the day trippers who arrive in droves at opening time. A good selection of rides, although it misses having real adrenalin rides. Some interesting pass-throughs on rides/slides that take you through marine tanks with sharks, rays, fish, etc. A perfect activity for the Dubai climate. Good lockers and storage facilities."

Signposting for the park itself could be better, but once inside the park there's plenty to keep big and little kids entertained. Lots of slides to choose from, though I'm not sure if the nearby Wild Wadi had more. The fact that there was a private beach to visit once in the water park was a deal sealer though, and the dolphins being on site will no doubt be a big plus for some visitors also. Not a cheap day out, but definitely worth it."

You can get to Ziggerat where all the slides are from the lazy river (as well as walking around the park) and there is a conveyor belt taking you up to the first level (whilst sat in your rubber ring). To get to higher levels get off at the first level via conveyor belt and then wlak up the stairs. So much fun being able to do majority of the slides with your partner on the same ring - my husband and i laughed and laughed. So much fun.Life guards (friendly guys) everywhere all around the lazy river!There are rapids which are connected by the lazy river too - good fun & surprisingly fast!FAB day out!! :-)"

The first part is truly excellent and fun for teenagers and adults as well. The second is vast, but it takes so long to get onto anything, that you spend most of your time waiting, looking for tubes, swimming down the stream etc. Plus both areas were, at least on the day we were there, extremely crowded, the restaurants are all basically fast food joints, and there is no real service to be talked about. Also, we were lucky in that it was cloudy and not very hot - I can't imagine how unpleasant it can get on a hot summer day in Dubai. So, all in all, a fun, but very touristy experience. If you are in Dubai long enough and this is your cup of tea or have not been to another major water park elsewhere in the world, then OK, but otherwise better do the dolphin experience at Atlantis and see other sites of Dubai."

Oh and take some time to say hi and catch a word with them as I think everyone is so busy having fun they forget that they are human!. Visit the dolphins and swim with them too (separate cost) - if I had the time we would have done this. The Acquarium is a big wow - (seperate cost to the water park). There are just so many things to do there but please ensure that you budget for all these , money and time wise. Take the Metro to Internet City and then board a bus or taxi (easier and quicker about 28AED). Get there early.

Aquaventure had some nice touches, there is a beach that you can use with sun loungers on it. Some of the rides were accessible via a type of escalator which takes you up to the rides whilst you are still sat in your inflatable. There are individual or 2 person inflatables, no 4person rides like Wild Wadi has. There is an odd system where you have to wait for an inflatable to come free as people exit a ride. You are best to hang on to your inflatable once you have one. Most of the rides are fairly indistinguishable from each other and are not very long. Also the concrete floor gets really hot and we burnt our feet walking from the ride area to the locker rooms. Wild Wadi address this issue by constantly spraying the floor with cold water, quite a simple thing that Aquaventure could adopt."

Go early and hang on to your tube once you have it, two of the rides can be accessed by staying in the water and going around again - otherwise you may have to queue, need footwear as pavements get really hot, lots of lifeguards and all very clean, height restrictions for youngsters. ok to wear bikinis/swimwear and/or shorts. Sunbeds get taken early on so find yours then go look for a better one and then move your towels, usually plenty of free ones by the beach. a good half day entertainment but not all day, go early and do rides then relax on beach in afternoon - enjoy!!"

Went on a rapids ride, and spent a good half hour trying to board the tube. Looked around and found a few other couples having the same difficulties. Finally scrambled onto one which overturned and sent me underwater and got a nasty bump on my head. The lifeguard watched stolidly. Finally asked a lady lifeguard, she said the tube was flat. Asked for another and got a rude glare in return. People were expected to find their own tubes, learn to board them themselves , and all along this route the so called lifeguards stood around in hostile attitudes and never helped a single person . Not what you expect from a water park that claims to be the best in Asia and Europe according to their own site.

Some of the rides are very similar but I enjoyed the Shark Attack. I'm a bit of a scaredy cat but was fine on Shark Attack, the river and 2 more in the Zigurrat tower. I actually started to get a bit sea sick from bobbing down the river for too long! We bought the platinum package but used a voucher in the reception of our hotel for a discount. This gave us a towel, locker, lunch and a souvenir cup including a drink. We felt this was great value for money. We arrived about 10.30 and there was already a fairly lengthy queue for tickets however we had no problem getting a sunbed. There are lots of beds for everyone, you just need to be prepared to settle on the beach if necessary.I am not a fish person at all but I really enjoyed The Lost Chamber - most enjoyable aquarium experience I've had."

Rode all the rides constantly over and over again(No one managed the Leap 0f Faith, obviously faithless family!) before lines started to build up about 2pm ish. We were all pretty much slid out by then!Having been to Florida/Disney waterparks this one seems the best designed. With most slides ending in rapids with conveyor belts to take you back up to other rides, this is CLASS! Not 3 millions steps to climb for every ride and plenty of shade for queueing areas.Would recommend that you leave well before closing as locker and changing areas didnt seem big enough for the size of crowds that this place pulls.18 DHS for a 500ml of coke is a CRIME! You're wallet has been warned!Apart from that we had a fantastic time!!"

We booked the combined package for the Waterpark and Lost Chambers at AED275 (only AED50 more than the basic access to the waterpark). Definitely a must to go to the Lost Chambers as it is just a beautiful aquarium. As we had booked online we expected to gain access pretty quickly but this was not the case. My husband had to queue for 45 minutes just to get the tickets whilst myself and 2 teenagers had to wait outside a cordoned off area until we were passed our wristbands and then we were allowed access. You can take water in but nothing else, no juice, no crisps, no oranges, these will get confiscated when your bag is checked. So finally after nearly an hour after arriving we were in the park. We paid AED75 for a big locker to store our belongings and then headed off into the park. We did take our own towels. Most of the rides here you need an inflatable whether a double or single. I suggest once you have an inflatable that you keep it with you as at certain busy periods which for us seemed to be after 12 until 3 it was very difficult to find a free one. If you do sit down to eat with your inflatable with you the staff will try and take it off you which we noticed on a couple of occasions with other guests.Certain kiosks only took cash which bearing in mind you are in a waterpark seems stupid (the wild wadi give you a plastic watch which you credit with money which would be more useful).We didn't eat in the park we only had drinks which were quite pricey, a small bottle of water was AED15 (\u00a32.50). We queued for all rides (except the lazy river/rapids). The quickest queue was about 20 minutes but the big rides was for about 30 minutes. We did \"The Leap of Faith\" which was great and the queues were big, you do get to go through the aquarium but you are going that fast that you don't get the benefit. Although there is one ride that you have a leisurely ride through the tube of the aquarium which is fantastic.Upon leaving the taxi queue was huge so we thought lets get the monorail but the staff member said that you would not be able to get a taxi at the end of the monorail (we appreciated his honesty) because its more that you park your car and get the monorail to the Atlantis. The monorail was AED15 single and AED25 return.Overall, would I visit it again.... no I wouldn't as I was very disappointed with it overall. We visited the Wild Wadi the following day and if I had to give a verdict it would be Atlantis 0 v Wild Wadi 1"

The park is great if you have kids there is lots to do but I personally don't rate it and think it is over priced for what it is...if you want to go I would recommend staying at the Atlantis so you don't have to pay to get in. However if you get chance you HAVE to feed the sting rays me and my partner did it the first time and was really lucky that there wasn't anyone else in the group. The staff are really friendly and very knowledgeable. When you get into the water (which is very refreshing as its cold) I was a little nervous as didn't know what to expect, me and my partner both held the shrimp under the water and what happened next was amazing!! About 20 stingrays come swimming up to you sucking on your skin which is a weird feeling but it is one of the most amazing things I have ever done. We got to stroke them, hold them I really can't recommend it enough, all the other fish come and play and there was a really big string ray that you aren't allowed to feed that swims on the bottom and tickles your feet. We loved this so much we went back a week later with my mum to do it again. If you can find out how many they have booked in at each time slot as I would recommend going with the smallest group to get the full impact of how amazing this is."

There were a few lines but went quickly.The staff were great and responsive. On the river tube ride, an inattentive couple's small children went into the river and the lifegaurds scooped them both up straight away.I would avoid going on the weekends and to avoid the crowds, if you don't have a cabana, \"grab\" lounge chairs by the Barracuda restaurant. It's a nice quiet area of the park.They have some construction for another pyramid for waterslides but it didn't hinder any of the experience. I can't wait to see what they have come up with next!!!"

We don't have a lot of money so it was a big deal paying the full price for an entry for two people. Almost instantaneously we were sadly disappointed. We had packed our own lunch in the hope of saving some money and we only had enough money for the taxi ride home as we were on a tight budget. What they don't tell you however is that you are not allowed to take in ANY of yor own food. It is not signed anywhere before you enter the park nor is it anywhere easily seen on their website. As they took all our food off us we explained that we didn't have an money to buy food and they just looked at us and shrugged their shoulders like 'oh well'. Obviously they do this just so that they get you spending as much money there as possible. The food is all incredibly overpriced American crap, about $20 (us) for a sandwich, chips and a drink, too bad for people who are on a special diet or who have young children, there are no healthy options available. They have a good idea using band s toen the lockers although i saw countless people having trouble opening them and getting very frustrated.The thing saving this place is definitely the rides, they are pretty well run and there are some amzing adrenaline boasting ones. Just takes the fun away when you have to spend the whole day hungry :("

We got on one of the trolleys at opening time, 10:00 AM. Everyone gets a wristband for day long use of the watermark. We really were only interested in the slides and the Lazy River. There were several lounge chair areas to hang around at but we planned on using the real beach after the rides. There were plenty of lounges on the beach which is separate from the hotel beach. Of course towels and snacks/beverages are available and the lounging chaises come with a shade. Swimming is lovely there! Now regarding the rides!!!!-They were fabulous, fun, scary and thrilling! Beware that many of the slides are in the dark as you spin on a inflated tube spinning as you descend down the tubes! Not everyone cares for such amusement, so if you are not a ride fanatic like myself, the lazy river may be more appealing. It was a little crowded, but not a real problem. The cost was included in our booking at The Atlantis, but the information is easily found on the website! Enjoy!"

You can purchase a set menu that's about $25 which includes two meals and drink. Good quality food as far as theme parks go. Rides were all okay but some of them did hurt a bit, you bang your feet going round corners. Maybe thats just tall people....If you've been to the big Disney water parks, (Blizzard Beach, Typhoon lagoon) then this won't be quite as good but it's still good. Here there are less slides and you ride in a ring for all rides. You can go in double rings but there are no group raft rides or anything like that. Overall, this place was great fun, well staffed with lots of lifeguards (some could do with smiling a bit more though) and if you get 'The Entertainer' book the 241 voucher makes it reasonable value. There's also a small mall area on the way in/out that has shops, the aquarium and several restaurants and a frozen yoghurt place."

It is also discriminatory against midgets most of whom are less than 1.2m. Even when you measure against a fixed post, a moveable one is used at the ride so cannot be considered as calibrated but are considered the only acceptable measure, leading to disappointment. Step changes in the height of the base with no signs and hard plastic matting which seriously hurts if you slip down it. The paving is all concrete/brick paving, which unshaded gets dangerously hot and is also uncomfortable in bare feet, sprayed water to cool, shading or timber deck would be an improvement. Most ridiculous is that you have to find a raft and hold onto it as they are not available at the rides. Consider alternatives."

My overall opinion is that the rides are great fun but there are a few issues which would put me off returning. We arrived just before it opened at 10am and didnt have to queue but be warned the queues quickly build up and a long wait is inevitable. Your bags are searched before you go in to prevent you taking in your own food and drink so not suprisingly the prices within the park were sky high (18dirhams for a bottle of water and 45dirhams for a cheeseburger, Im sorry but im not paying nearly \u00a310 for a burger!!) All the rides except the Leap of Faith require use of a single or double inflatable ring which soon became a problem, we went on all the rides straight away then went and sunbathed for a while before trying to go on the rides again but couldnt find a free ring anywhere and eventually had to give up and cut short our day. We noticed people were taking rings back to their sunbeds and keeping them for later use thus preventing other people using them. We tried waiting near the end of rides for people to discard their rings but so did many other people and we ended up queuing in the water hoping for a ring. I think the volume of people in the waterpark probably outnumbered the rings by 4-1 maybe?On the plus side, the rides were great fun the best Ive been on, the beach is a nice place to escape the crowds and the locker rooms were clean and the showers provided complimentary shower gel and shampoo.My advise to anyone thinking of going, get a 2for1 voucher, get there early and get on each ride as many times as possible to get your moneys worth before putting your ring down as you'll struggle to get one later on in the day!"

We've been to Aquaventure a couple of times, we really enjoyed it alot, its big and the lazy rivers are the coolest, for if you would just like to chill in the water but still get some action.I love the layout of the park, as you dont have to get up on stairs and stand in queues, it's a great idea how you'd be on your tube and the water will automatically take you to the slide.All the staff there are smiley and they add alot to the experience, a few of them were singing, it was so fresh to see how they enjoyed and loved their jobs :)I would suggest for whoever's visitng Aquaventure to leave before closing time, as changing rooms get crazily unpleasantly busy, showers numbers compared to visitors just dont do.Another comment would be the overpriced food over there, and you have no option other than to eat, on a long day in the sun.Nevertheless its a must visit for dubians :)"

There are only few attractions (slides) and you can wait a petty long time (30+ min) to get to attraction. We have found many people staying in lines and just waiting.... a long, There is very nice beach, where you can find nice palm trees with shade. We have enjoyed more this than attractions.

I was glad we stay in the Kempinski on the Palm. At the Aquaventure are extremely long queues to purchase tickets for the park. So calculate that in when you have booked specific times for special attractions. Once you are in it's a kind of hard to find your way around. Asking the clueless staff doesn't help as well. So much for the negative part.We booked a shark snorkeling tour. This was a great experience for the kids swimming with predators in a controlled environment. The outstanding guide (a former NAVY diver) calmed down the kids and dispersed their anxieties. To scubadive would have been even better but snorkeling was a great start. The kids loved the slides. It's normally quite crowded but worth to wait."

Our 7 year old daughter (who has been on many, many rides before) was just a little bit too short to go on the rides, so was restricted to the kid's water park and the lazy river rafting ride all day. We knew there was a height requirement, but didn't realize it applied to all but just one of the rides, so we were quite disappointed. Even if our daughter was tall enough, there were not that many rides in the park. Also, smokers are allowed to smoke everywhere, which is not pleasant for non-smokers.It was a beautiful place, though, and we liked the awnings on each lounge chair which made it quite comfortable and relaxing.Make a reservation at one of the restaurants in the hotel in advance, or else they are booked up and you have to stand in a 40 minute taxi line with everyone else when the park closes."

You can keep going round for as long as you want !!As with most Dubai facilities - spotlessly clean and well designed.Food outlets are average.Tip - if all the loungers are taken around the pool and rides - the park has it's own beach where you will find loads more loungers and a good beach restaurant.All in all a good day out but may disappoint the seasoned water Parker."

Food is reasonably priced and there is a fair choice available - you are not allowed to take your own food or drink into the attraction.

If we had to pay, I think one time would be enough - the price for a day is AED225 for adults and AED180 for children (about $50-60), plus the cost of towel rental, locker and food which is exorbitantly priced!There is a nice area for children with lots of fun slides, our child really enjoyed it. One downside to that area is that lots of families dropped their belongings off on the sun chairs but never actually spent time on the chairs (since people are in the water for most of the time) making it almost impossible to find a chair. Seems logic to me that you don't need to \"reserve\" 5 chairs if you will only use one or two at one time. We had only one chair for the 3 of us every time and that's all we needed since the kids area is not a place for sun tanning, it's a play area and we were in the water with our child most of the time. The lack of common courtesy was a bit disturbing.For grown ups there are also a few nice rides - we tried them all and thought the leap of faith was the best of them (almost vertical slide that goes through the shark pool). Nothing too extreme, but fun nonetheless. The river rapids were also a hit with our child. It can be a bit hard to find a spot at the main pool, but if you go to the beach near the restaurant Barracudas, you will find lots of spots available. It's at the far end of the park and there's some construction going on nearby but it's really not that disruptive and you probably won't even notice.As can be expected, park is busier on weekends - Friday and Saturday, as Sunday is the first day of the work week in Dubai - but even on the weekend we didn't have to wait long in line. Lots of lifeguards, really lots! We never felt unsafe."

We went here on beginning of March 2013,We did not pay entrance, because we were guests of the Atlantis The Palm Hotel, so it was complimentary.Opens at 10h00Closes at 18h00A nice waterpark. As you can see, I am not overwhelmed. Let me discribe it.Many many lifeguards. No one will ever drown here.Mainly only tube slides. Only one steep \"normal\" slide.Wild water canals to be ridden on tubes.No holiday, no weekend, we were here on low season. As of about 11h00 almost all sunlouges were taken, although there are many.As of about 11h30 there were cues at many of the interesting slides. Nice thing:Most slides take you up without waliking. Either with (rather slow) escelator, or they jet you up.some of the tubes have a hight min. of 120cm.Nice big pool for smaller children, with many small slides. Again many lifeguards. BUT My smaller one was a bit scared, because every 3-5 Minutes a big bucket unloads many liters of water onto the whole construction... Even for an adult a lot of waterpressure to handle, but just puts a 3 year old flat on the water. Nice idea, but no good.This place was clearly designed by Sol Kerzner. But his first waterpark at Lost City is a lot better! A lot! Been there many times.Similar for the Hotel by the way. It is not worth the entrance price! A Burger (no chips=french fries, nor coke) is at EUR 8,- A souvenir T-Shirt at EUR 30,- even for a 3 year old.Very expensive place and nothing out of the unusual. Slides are not special, nor do they have special effects.Of course this average rating is due to the high price. Would this cost about EUR 20,- per Person it would be a \"Must Go\".So if you are a guest of the Hotel, its free, Go and have a lot of fun.If you are not a guest but go to the Palm extra for this Aquaventure Waterpark... Its not really worth it if you know waterparks in the world. Lost City is a recommendation.Oh yes: It was only 30 in March - I have trouble immagening the place at 40 and hotter, for I thought that there were too little shady places."

If it looks busy first place to go is near to the barracuda restaurant. Two reasons, first there are loads of sun beds that most never use, secondly it's also a good place to pick up spare rubber rings. At the moment a fairly large section of the park is closed for refurb. Whilst this is made clear when you are buying tickets (except not how big it is, just stated as a section of the rapids) it should be made clear on their website and ant so once you've spent money getting there you are less likely to turn around and go back to your hotel/home. It's a large enough section that I think should be reflected in reduced prices and aren't. The other good thing about going to the barracuda side is that currently they are doing BBQ food which tastes great served with rice or veg and roast potatoes. Considering a captive audience the 110 for surf and turf was good vale"

Kids will definitely enjoy the little slides and the pool made for them while teens and brave adults will surely get thrilled to try all those slides. Bravest ones should try the Leap of Faith, A 9-story tall slide wherein you will almost slide standing! and when you go down, you will pass by this tube surrounded by sharks!

The slides are great, a very steep one, tube roller coaster and a lazy river which isn\u00b4t that lazy, including rafting, the ride around the park takes about 30 minutes and is a lot of fun. Single and double tube rides, a kids playground, slides that take you through the shark tank and direct beach access with beach volley ball and beach soccer field.

And of course the shark attack ride. Plenty of seats. New locker system posed some problems for us (and others we saw as well). One of us had to go back to the entrance to get a new wristband. The one thing we were displeased with was the taxi stand, who after we insisted on a normal taxi, put us in a hotel taxi that would run on the meter (so the duty manager assured us). Upon arrival at our hotel (also on the Palm, a five minute drive) the driver wanted to charge us 40 dirhams (normal rate including a tip is 20 dirhams). We got into a discussion about not turning on the meter, we just left him with the 20 dirhams which was the correct amount and left."

However, the guards assigned to restrict access to these guest-only restaurants lack conviction and most people brush right past them. (2) Although regular cabs routinely drop people off at Aquadventure, people leaving the attraction in smal;l, cab-sized groups are channelled into Lexus cabs. These cabs are also metered but they cost more than regular cabs and in spite of having advanced navigation systems in the cars they don't seem to always find their ways to where you want to go via the most direct (i.e., cheapest) route."

Situated at Atlantis hotel it's free for guests of the hotel but rather pricy if your not. There are multiple rides all very very good but on stands out from the rest: The Leap of Faith this is essentially a vertical drop which then goes through a shark tank in a tube and out the other end it's one of the most exhilarating waterslides ever!! Reaching over 32mph and lasts about 6 seconds it is a great hit for kids! As it has a special kids zone with climbing parts and a bucket full of water."

As soon as we got in we headed for the water slides. Almost all of them start in the main Aztec styled tower in the centre of the park which makes things nice and easy. The selections of rides is good. All very clean and modern, and easy to get to because its all very central. Compared to Wet And Wild in Australia it's great. They also have a great system where the rides interconnect or flow on to each other which eliminates a lot of walking and lining up. When we firs arrived there were hardly any lines so we were able to use each slide very quickly without queuing. It then got quite a bit busier by about 3 and lining up would have been about 20 - 30 minutes per ride. Having risen each one once we had our fun and went home. Quite an expensive three hours but a lot of fun. These places just are not worth the money when you spend the whole time lining up. So if you can avoid crowds that's when it's worth while."

The absence of gambling and alcohol consumption made the experience more family oriented.My son went through all the rides (except for the leap of faith, which I enjoyed more than I did at the Bahamas location).My wife insisted in renting a cabana and it turned out to be a great option (more towels, not wasting time going to the locker, personalized service, etc.)I still smile whenever I remember that day."

Also, in January the weather may have deterred many - although for UK visitors the 24 degrees made things very pleasant but after a couple of hours it did feel a bit chilly when outside the water. Of note, our host had intended to take us to Wild Wadi as he considers it a better experience but it was closed during that month. I also understand at Wild Wadi they operate a much better system for purchasing credit for drinks etc, whereas at Aquaventure you have to pay with cash or card whilst in the park."

            "review": "AQUAVENTURE WATER PARK AT THE ATLANTIS HOTEL, DUBAI. The Aquaventure Water Park is part of The Atlantis Hotel complex, located at The Palm in Dubai. This is a great place to go for a family day out, which I highly recommend. If you are a guest staying at the hotel itself, then you are granted unlimited complimentary access, otherwise for non-residents there is an admission fee. I have visited many other adventure water parks in the past, but this is undoubtedly one of the best I have been to. It is beautifully and immaculately presented with its lush tropical themed landscape surrounded by palm trees, with calming lagoons and its own exclusive private beach (access to this is included in the admission price for non-residents). It is really well maintained, and spotlessly clean, and the water is crystal clear. You can simply choose to relax and sunbathe or read a book on one of their really comfortable sun loungers (complete with canopy to shield and protect you from the heat and glare of the burning sun), or you can join in all the fun of the water activities on offer, of which there are plenty. There are many rides and water slides available at the park, such as 'The Rapids' (which was my absolute favourite), alternatively you can experience the leisurely tidal effect of 'Torrent River', but if you're feeling exceptionally brave, then you could always attempt the vertical water slide known as 'The Leap of Faith'. This water slide looked positively terrifying to me, and yet at the same time enormously exhilarating (at this particular juncture, I should point out that my husband, my son and I were all complete cowards and were perfectly happy to stand and watch others take the plunge)!!! Depending on your preference, this is a place of complete leisure, where you can either relax and unwind, or splash about for the duration, depending on your preference. I must say, I found it totally refreshing and a stark contrast to the sweltering heat, as I was able to cool myself down (bearing in mind we went in August, one of the hottest months). Guest safety is obviously of tantamount importance to this establishment, as there were lifeguards in abundance, who were strategically placed in 'key' areas of the park, keeping a watchful eye over visitors to the park. But this is more of a precautionary measure to ensure guest safety, which I found very reassuring, to know that they were being very vigilant and closely monitoring the park, but without being intrusive. In the highly unlikely event that someone did manage to get themselves into difficulties, then they would be extremely quick to react, so guest safety is clearly a priority, and so 'safety' issues should not pose a concern for anyone. In addition, as well as appearing very professional, they were also all really friendly and nice, smiling and waving at guests as they went round the waterways circuits, which offered additional fun to the entire experience. Food and beverages are available to purchase on site, as well as a range of swimming related products. However, I do have just one word of 'caution', and that is...don't forget to use your sunscreen, especially if you have young children, as the sun is very intense and you will get 'burnt' if you don't (actually that is in fact, '26' words by my reckoning). I actually forgot, and as a consequence of that, I suffered a severely burnt face, legs and shoulders, but that was totally my own fault. This will make a great family day out, full of fun and entertainment, but it is also suitable for friends and couples alike, as well as families. Beverly Khan."

            "review": "Come early if you want to go on the water slides!. We took a cab here from our hotel (Hilton Jumeirah Resort) it cost us 50 AED. It truly is unbelievable how they built this water park on an artificial palm island. Amazing! I have been to the Atlantis in the Bahamas & found that one to be much larger then the Dubai one. We came here right when it opened & there was already a queue to buy passes. The park opens from 10am-sunset for the winter time. I used the entertainment voucher, which saved us a bundle. We got the silver pass, which was for admission cost, locker rental, & 1 towel rental. Admission cost for people over 1.2 metres 225 AED, below 1.2 meters 180 AED. Towel & locker rental 50 AED. After getting our passes we went to the lockers, which were located nearby the main entrance of the park. You have to scan your wrist pass to activate a locker, which is a pain. Its even more annoying when it doesn't work properly. I saw a lot of people having issues with their wrist pass. There is a staff member on hand to help, but every time you go back to your locker you need to scan the pass to open and lock your locker. Afterwards, we exchanged our receipts for the towels. If you are a day visitor to the park and renting towels, this towel will stay with you all day, you cannot exchange it for a new towel. We then immediately made a bee line to the Ziggurat. We first lined up for the leap of faith. There were only 10 people ahead of us. Great ride, truly exhilarating. I screamed my head off. Totally fun, yet thrilling! We then did all the rest of the Ziggurat rides. It is highly recommended to come right when the park opens if you want to go on the rides. As the day progressed, the lines were getting really long! Also, it was very difficult to find loungers & tubes. If you want a double tube, be sure to take one early in the day, by mid day there were none to be found. The lazy river is great. Just relax & aimlessly float about. I rode around the river several times. I tend to get cold easily & I found the water to be warm.The beach at Atlantis is nice & vast, but not spectacular. The water is very calm, but a bit chilly. There were lots of loungers with umbrellas available. Day guest are only limited to only the Aquaventure or Sandance beach. The other beaches are reserved for the hotel guests. Also you cannot ride on the buggy shuttle as those are also for the hotel guests only. We did have lunch @ Shark bites & used an entertainment voucher as well for that.There are a couple of gift shops here, but I didn't' see anything worthwhile to buy. This place would be a full day event. It would also be a good idea to combine it with a stop @ the Lost Chambers. I would recommend Aquaventure if you are a waterpark fan, but be sure to come right when it opens if you want to go on the water slides. I also wanted to add another thing that is related to Aquaventure. When you do decide to leave, leave before sunset or before the water park closes. As the queue for taxi was just ridiculous & we did not see any taxi in sight! There is only one road in and out of Atlantis. We then made the mistake of taking the monorail. Which was overpriced. You have to purchase a monorail card, which is 15 AED per person one way. The monorail itself is very clean. There are 4 stops but you can only get off @ Atlantis or Gateway (bottom of the trunk). The train for some reason stops at the non open stations & it travels at a slow speed. When we did get off the train, we had to give the monorail cards back to the staff, which is a shame. They are nice looking cards, which I would have liked to keep as souvenirs. Now we took the monorail assuming there would be taxi waiting there. I was wrong. The monorail was full of people that thought the same thing as me. We follow this long path which leads us out by the highway. There are 0 taxi's waiting here! Instead we were greeted by 3 cars that offer to drive us, but they are not official taxi's! They were just random men charging high prices to drive you back to your hotel. When I was approached by these men & I told them where I wanted to go, they would refuse. They would either make up an excuse that they couldn't go there or the driver would simply walk away from me not providing an explanation. Why would you ask me where I want to go and then just say no? By now this area is full of people wanting to get back to their hotel. Every time a car pulled up to us everyone ran to it like an animal banging on the glass to get in. This really turned me off & left a really sour taste in my mouth. I was very displeased with this. It was just chaotic. I mean the taxi drivers should know that people would take the monorail here to escape the long queue @ Atlantis. Somehow this needs to be organized. Why did they build this monorail & not connect it with anything? How are we suppose to go anywhere if there are no taxis here? There are no sidewalks to get to a place that would have a taxi. I am wet, cold, and tired. I just wanted to head back to my hotel. It was really silly. They was a huge crowd of people standing at the side of the highway trying to flag down anything that would stop to give a ride. Eventually, we did get back to the hotel but we had to pay 50 AED + the 45 AED monorail cost to get back to our hotel, which was only 10 minutes away. Whereas, from the Hilton Jumeirah to Atlantis only costed us 50 AED. So again, be sure to leave before the mass crowds do or you'll be waiting around for a long time!"

This one (part of the excellent Palm Atlantis resort) is not bad by any stretch and excellent if you're on a family holiday. If you're an adult (whether young or old) there are better choices however.The others are:- Wild Wadi (nr the Burj Al Arab Hotel) - also good for kids.- Aqualand (Um Al Quain) has pro's and cons. Cons are: smell in the air (when the wind blows the wrong way), distance out of town (60-90 minute drive), age of the rides (old). Pros: You can booze on site and the BEST booze shop in the UAE is next door. Expect very cheap tax free prices and a huge selection.- Yas Waterworld (Abu Dhabi) OPENING 24th January. Not yet been but it's already boasting a HUGE number of rides and the usual fastest, longest, tallest, etc in the world. I'm keen to check this puppy out later this month!"

The first day of the visit we arrived at noon and waited almost 30 minutes to get in despite buying tickets online. This was a preview of the lines throughout the park and especially for the more popular rides. That said, we still found loungers in a good spot and the lazy river, Rapids and some tamer rides were walk-on available throughout. The food, however, is mediocre and overpriced. We employed a better strategy on day two.Arriving at opening time of 10am on day two, the park was empty and we staked out 4 prime loungers and could walk on to any ride at will for the first hour - Leap of Faith, etc. It is highly recommended that if you can, get there 15 minutes prior to opening and make the most of your first couple of hours, then take it easy the rest of your time there. Park is good for all ages. Would have given a higher rating if food was better, prices slightly lower, location closer to Dubai and signage and staffing better. If we had to choose between Wild Wadi and Aquaventure ... I'd choose Wild Wadi."

But this is not your average waterpark. It has mostly rough and tumble rides with rapids in the lazy river that bounce and twirl you around, and steep drops in some of the tube rides that are not for the faint of heart. There is one body slide called the Leap of Faith which plunges you straight down at a steep angle, and can be scary for those not eager to throw yourself off a high ledge. I did see one fairly big play area for smaller children who just want to splash around in the water. Overall, it was a great day. Even the food at Shark Bites was yummy, not your average greasy fast food, but filled with healthy choices like the yummy falafel. I loved it, my teenage kids loved it, and my wife got to lay out in the sun all day - and it's free if you stay at Atlantis. What could be better?"

The main attraction is a long river with rapids sections and a tidal wave section. This soaks up the crowds, even on a busy day. I visited as a day guest (hotel guests of Atlantis get this as a perk) and it is a very expensive day out (equivalent of UK\u00a340 each). Everything is an extra cost item - locker, towel rental - and food & drink are very expensive. Despite these things, it was one of the most enjoyable days in a waterpark I've had and I would definitely return. Visiting the park is a good way to see the Palm."

Firstly buy your tickets online and you will save yourself approx 10-15%, you will also save yourself queuing time as you can go directly to the guest services line (9 and 10) and avoid the general admission bundle!! Secondly refreshments inside the park are on a parr with any captive market around the world like Disney, Alton Towers etc etcBe prepared to queue for some of the bigger slides like the Surge & Plunge, but make sure you do the ride that goes through the aquarium, it's brilliant and unique!The lazy river and rapids make Centre Parcs rapids look two bob! they take ages to go round and are a pleasant mix of exhilaration and relaxation.

We took in our own water which was not taken off us and took towels. We arrived as it opened for the day and left as it was closing. We got some covered sunlounges and slathered on the sunscreen. The waterpark had something for all ages. Because there were so many adults we could divide ourselves up to accompany the kids for their age group and swap around as who wants to spend all day at the toddler area. We also didn't require a locker as there was always someone to stay with our bags. But most people just left their bags on the chairs and I didn't here or see anything getting stolen from them. We spent a lot of time just floating around on the innertubes. We all got to go on every ride at least once and more if we wanted. Staff very helpful and kept park immaculate. The sprinklers to keep the concrete cool was much appreciated in the heat! The rides were a lot of fun and everyone had a great day but exhausted by the end.

Given the brilliance of Dubai as a tourist destination, I felt the park is a bit over-hyped in its ride variety, yet, one must applaud the cleanliness observed in the water, the safety measures implemented, and the quality of the rides. \"Leap of Faith\" ride, and the rides through the \"Shark Tank\" are worth appreciating. There are a couple of good options for the kids as well. If the price tag can be around $45, instead of the prevailing $65 approx., it is a great one-time visit."

Situated inside the Atlantis hotel at palm jumeirah. one can either take a cab and visit here or else take a mono rail which takes you directly to this place. I personally enjoyed leap of faith ride the most since the rest were just ohk. most of the rides goes zig zag. good place for kids to enjoy. guests at the hotel goes for free while outsiders need to pay.ladies please make sure not to wear anything made of denim since they do not allow it inside the park. Also one need to take the locker facility since it would be tough to look after your belongings once inside the park."

If you want the privilege to park near the entrance, you shell out AED 150, which is exorbitant!The entrance is a 15 minutes wait, and your bags get frisked and checked not for security but cos they wouldn't allow any outside food or beverages in!The entrance costs AED 225 for adult and AED 180 for a child. A small locker rental will set you back by another AED 40 and if you haven't got your own towel, than be ready to pay another AED 30!Like I said, no food or beverages from outside is allowed, and what is on offer is awfully expensive and lacks in quality. A 500ml bottle of water which usually costs AED 1 in supermarket is priced at AED 13.. talk about paying premium!! A kids meal with 2 pcs of chicken is for AED 50 and is a two-bite meal affair!Getting back to the park.. There is only one locker and changing room, which is quite odd for such a large tourist attraction and we found it over-crowded.There are just 6 water slides in all with the highlight being the Leap of Faith. But heading there require a lot of patience, as the wait in the queue is between 10-20 minutes. Being with friends may help as you can pass off the time in conversations. Also kids under 1.2m are restricted from these rides, so you may not really make most of it if you are with kids.Apart from the Leap of Faith, other rides are more like average and worth a single ride only. The two river rides.. The Rapids and The Torrents are much better than the water rides frankly, and are good for the entire family.At best, the whole experience will last you 3 hours to the max before you get bored out.Finding tubes, be is single or double seater is a challenge and the place has no maps to guide you... you just move around and help-your-self. The only map we saw was at the beach, which was on the other end of the park.The beach was simply fake and the sand felt as rough as ever. There were no crashing waves and no kids to be seen playing with sand castles or the likes. There were only a handful of people there trying to get a tan.At the price they charge, it is a big disappointment and you wouldn't do yourself any sin if you skipped it from your Dubai must-do list. Head instead to Wild Wadi and have a much pleasant half-day, enjoying splashing in the water, and soaking in the sun!"

We spent approx 3 hours in the park (which I personally think is just about enough time)! The queue times were minimal and the park seemed relatively quiet. The Leap of Faith was the highlight although very nerve racking when you get to the top (I managed to do it twice though)! I found the lazy rivers a bit too lazy and slow!!! And a few of the rides which you rode in a dinghy seemed a little slow too however, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and although I have visited better waterparks, I would visit again if I were to visit or stay at Atlantis. You must go on the Leap of Faith (the best waterslide by far)!!!!"

You are not restricted as to how many times you can go on the slides. I would not bother coming to the water park if you want to experience the shark attack ride as it is hugely disappointing.

The lazy river, with various sections of rapids, was long but it was shown as different rides when in fact it's just one! The other flume rides are all very similar involving sitting on rubber rings. The best one was going down a dark flume and coming out surrounded by the aquarium full of rays, sharks and shoals of fish. The facilities, changing rooms, eating places, etc are all very modern and clean. It was quite expensive for a family day out. We preferred Wild Wadi waterpark which had a better selection of rides."

The views from the top of the tower housing the main slides is fantastic, you can see over the palm and Jumierah beach.The biggest let down is the sheer size of the park. Getting from one bit to another is a real trek esp in the summer as you scorch your feet on the pavements, if you want to wade through the water to get around your feet are scratched to death on the rough bottoms of the pools and waterways. The hotel seemed very nice indeed and the park is well organised however, I won't be going back here but will be going back to Wild Wadi.Visited mid 2011"

Rides nice and all looked clean etc - not a massive selection, kids probably would have loved it but as a group of 4 adults not very impressed and did not feel value for money.

The entry price is AED225 (approx \u00a345) for the waterpark or AED275 (approx \u00a355) for the combi ticket of waterpark and aquarium. We chose the AED225 option. We also had to pay AED50 for a towel/locker combi (or AED30 for just a towel). We found the entry costs quite expensive but assumed it would be a top quality waterpark for the price. Unfortunately we were disappointed to find that there were only 6 water slides, which were mediocre. The park looks nice, but I have been to better water parks for less money. Tip: buy yourself the Meal Deal at the park entrance. For AED45 you can choose a burger/hot dog/fried chicken/salad with fries and a drink. However without a Meal Deal you will pay approx AED55 just for the burger/hot dog etc without fries and drink."

I can't actually imagine a waterpark that would be better than this one; scary rides, great slides, fun things like donuts and currents, brilliant setting. Obviously great for families but I had a blast with three of my male friends too. The Leap Of Faith (or the 'Death Slide' as we like to call it) was a breathless, quite terrifying 4 seconds but for someone who's scared of heights, I'm glad I plucked up the courage to do it! I'd recommend that in your day, you try each slide and ride at least once. Downsides: the extortionate entrance fee ($50 per person) and the long queues/lines for each ride. All in all though, a must visit and a fantastic day out."

We were surprised to find that you actually park away from the hotel and then get a shuttle bus BACK. I guess this avoids congestion so it is well thought through. But this would add an extra 20mins travel time.As with most places in Dubai, arriving early has its benefits. However, we were quite disappointed to find that even though we had booked our tickets online, you still had to queue with everyone else and even arriving fairly early, it was a good 10-15mins wait. I really can\u2019t see the point of booking online at all if there are no benefits and facilities to just grab your ticket separately and go.If you are there early, I would recommend doing the big slides first. Even after an hour of being there, the queues were getting noticeably larger so get them all in first. The rides themselves are great \u2026 a little confusing to navigate around the pyramid and work out what is non-tube, what is double tube only etc. I would then spend the afternoon going around the rapids as they are never that congested.If you have lunch at one of the small beachside cafes, prepared to be hungry. The portion sizes are enormous and we could have all just ordered one sandwich/baguette with fries to share between 2 people.Overall, a great day out."

The water park at Atlantis has several great water slides and a river that runs throughout the park that offers a wonderfully relaxing afternoon floating around on an inner tube. There are about 6 or 7 water slides, of varying degrees of scariness, and they are great fun.The park itself seems well designed, and the beach has beautiful views of the Dubai skyline.The only complaints would be that purchasing ticks was very slow and it seemed as if the staff were working their first day. Perhaps this was an anomaly, but I suggest arriving before the opening time, to allow time for ticket purchase. Also, Atlantic could be a bit more helpful to day guests: they charge for towels and locker rental, which seems a bit much since you already pay a good sum to enter the park. Then, you get one towel for the day, with no exchanges, and the lockers are far away from the slides, not near them, so you are constantly walking back to them if you need something like sunscreen or your camera. Of course, you can leave your things on a lounge chair, but not sure how safe it will be in a crowded water park if you leave for the slides. Overall, we found it a bit difficult to keep track of our things and do the water slides, as we were only two people. Lockers located all over the park and a chance to exchange towels would have been helpful."

We opted to go to Aquaventure instead of Wild Wadi, because we wanted to see the Palm, the Atlantis and because we wanted to experience the slide which goes through an aquarium tunnel full of sharks and other fishes. However, although this slide still excists, it doesn't go through the aquarium tunnel any longer, so that was actually quite a dissapointment. For most attractions you need a tube. The attractions are nice, but if you want to go for a faster/more scary one, the ones with the tube are not the best of course. I'm not sure how the attractions at the Wild Wadi are, but it could be that the ones there are faster. We spend a good 4 hours at the park and we had a great time. You can also buy a combo-ticket which gives you entrance permission to The Lost Chambers, which is quite nice."

I booked the dolphin experience as never done it before and I thought whilst I'm In Dubai for a couple of days why not. Booked the early appointment (9:10), two reasons firstly so it won't be that hot in the morning and secondly I could then spend the rest of the day at the water park. I booked the royal swim at dolphin cay, it was expensive about 1025 aed but it was worth every penny. The Royal swim is limited to 6 people per group. The price for dolphin swim also includes entry to aquaventure. You start off with the safety talk and also the trainer has some general information on the dolphins. Then the good part, you get in the water. They firstly get you as a group to lift the dolphin up to feel how heavy they are. You then get a fin ride, we're you grab in to the fins of two dolphins and you are pulled along. You then get a boogie board and again pushed along by the dolphins nose pushing your foot. It truly was a magnificent thing to do and one I would really like to experience again and would also recommend everybody to try it, it will be a memory that will last with me for a very long time. Now for the disappointment, aquaventure. After all the excitement of the royal swim I was looking forward to spending the day in the water park. Firstly the problem is, its not that big there are roughly 8/9 slides that either use a tube to sit in or you go with out one. I roughly did all the slides within about 45 mins and some of them twice as well. I mean they are good especially were you go through the tunnel and the sharks, stingrays and fish swim around you but that is it there needs to be more things to do. I loved the lazy river, this was one of the best things at the park, I spent most of my time at the park going round and round. Also in respect of the fees for the towels and lockers I think that is extortionate, 40 aed for a locker and 30 aed for a towel. If you haven't been to Dubai and want something to do, I would recommend the royal swim but possibly not the water park side of it.My rating is 5 stars and this is purely because of the royal swim."

It is a long way from anything so taxi expensive plus as someone else said kids are adults if over 1.2m as our 9 year old was but they can go on all slides at that height. Prices aside this is an excellent waterpark. We are very wimpy about slides but we tried a few. We LOVED the shark attack. Very fast and dark. Went on double ring so didn't spin. The sides are well designed as they slow you down quickly at the end so no big splash. We then bobbed thru shark tank. Fab. We also loved the rapids which look scary but are really fun. Loads of lifeguards who were very friendly. Kids loved kids play area. However this pace is huge. We dumped our stuff on one subbed which was hard to find again. We never sat down all day which seems the same for nearly everyone yet nearly every bed had a towel on! Lockers are extra so I suppose they had to leave their stuff somewhere. Couldn't let kids go off on own as we would never have found them again. Beach ok but no free sun beds so had a swim and perched on an abandoned one whilst kids played. Day did involve lots of queuing for each slide. Only place with no queue is rapids so went on this loads, 2 km long so takes ages. Says it closes at sunset but this was about 5 pm so didn't have time to do everything. Map is very vague and when you are at slides you are not sure of severity.Overall we did enjoy it but day a little spoiled by the hour wait for a taxi at the end of the day and changing rooms were a joke as everyone thrown out at same time. Be prepared for cost. Only bring water as they remove juice and food from your bag when you enter!"

The rides themselves are pretty good, but by around 1pm had been on everything. We had lunch at the park (you can have money on your locker key/wrist band and this prevents the need to go back to the lockers for cash or carry it around with you), usual fast food choice available. We decided to stay for another hour or so after lunch and went back on some of the rides. I was expecting Aquaventure to be better than Wild Wadi, but to be honest there's not really much difference, still worth a visit and a good day out."

Everyone was very helpful and the shark slides were really good. Approximate waiting times would have been helpful to list."

We pre booked via our agent and i am glad we did because when we arrived by taxi there was an hour queue, unless you had a pre paid voucher.Once in, we went to guest relations to get towels etc, about 15 minutes wait. They give you a wrist band to wear that you can load money onto and it operates the lockers, if you are lucky, its a bit fiddly and lots of the lockers were broken. BEWARE - if you are a family, male and female lockers are separate and so you will need 2 at 40 dirhams each.Towels are 30 dirhams each but the towel hut is no where near the locker room and i had trouble finding it at all.If you can't find any free sunbeds, which we couldn't because it was so crowded, you have no where to put the towels down, when you have them, so you either have to walk into the park and get the towels and then bring them back, or carry around the slips of paper and hope that they don't get wet before you choose to get your towels (unlikely)The lockers will fit in a backpack and some crocs and a towel, but not much more,3 toilets in the ladies changing area and some very dark, small changing cubicles, not that comfy for the amount of ladies and surprising for a newish park.Already, you may be able to see the disorganised feeling of my review.Bags searched on the way in to stop you bringing in food etc. ice-cream was 20 dirhams each, didn't get any food as we had had a big breakfast.You have to retrieve a tube from the beach area and carry it to the rides which are organised in such a way that you get on one and then get fed off onto another and another. if you are like us and not all the family are eligible or up for all the rides, you usually wait by the entrance or near where you got on to meet afterwards. in this park, this is not possible as when you get off the ride, you are no where near the entrance so its a long walk and a long wait.The lazy river has rapids that may not be suitable for some, but is quite cool. My 10 year old son and his dad did enjoy the rides that they went on, Plenty of life guards around and plenty of tubes.When we had finished for the day we went back to the lockers and did not use the towel vouchers so i asked for a refund, along with my money back from my wristband that i did not spend, NO refunds on towels eventhough i explained the issue and the management just said \"that's business\" so i would recommend taking your own.The taxi queue at 6pm was an hour long as well, with no alternative other than the shuttle bus into the mall of the emirates (free), but i was hardly dressed for a trip into town (shorts, vest top and a thin cover up), not expecting anything but to go from there, straight back to my own hotel on the mainland. overall i would say not worth the money, which was very disappointing."

The fair was of thousands. Despite huge croud, didn't feel much waiting. The place was reasonably managed, clean, hygienic and supervised by many lifeguards. We were family of 6 people from age of 5 year old kid to 63 year old grandpa. it was fun for everyone. We spent 6-7 hours doing different water slides, river rides, we did all except Leap of Faith (steep water slide), which looked scary. By the time we decided to try leap of faith, the place started to close. It was a day full of thrill and excitement. A day well spent."

Located in the famous Atlantis Resort on the top of the Jumeirah Palm.We drove there so only took like an hour from our hotel in Bur Dubai.We had vouchers for Buy 1 Get One Free entrance and also for a towel & locker combo. Prices are advertised on their website but you can't pre-book - just turn up on the day.After queuing up and then finding our lockers, we changed and went out to explore. There is a 2 km stream that has rapids and torrent sections. You need to use a tube - either single or a double. These are great fun.They also have water slides. Again using your tube. There's one called Shark Attack where go down in darkness and then shoot out the other side in a plastic glass tunnel that goes through a shark tank with real sharks! Other water slides called The Plunge, and 2 others which I can't remember. The most famous one is called the Leap of Faith. You climb up to 27 m high and after queuing you travel down fast to the bottom - great fun!A tip - you can't take any food or drink into the park as they insist on you buying stuff inside. We thought the food prices were very extortionate, so we didn't bother. For a burger they wanted 45Dhs. We went outside and on our way back we stopped and burger joint and got 3 meals for 45Dhs!!! So you can see what I mean.Overall an enjoyable day.Whilst there you can also go to the Chambers - which is basically a huge Aqaurium thingy. But we saw one at the Dubai Mall."

Started on the water rides which were incredible if a little heart racing! It's nice to be very lazy and not have to climb the stairs each time you want to go down due to their very clever rubber ring transport system. We then used the lazy river/rapids. The park started to get a little busier at lunch so we decided to use the onsite beach for a couple of hours. It was beautifully calm and quiet and we could have quite happily spent a couple of days there! We managed to have a great lunch - expensive but then what theme parks aren't - and then head back to the rides late afternoon.The park was clean, staff were helpful and we had a fantastic time there."

We arrived just after 11.30 and had to queue for 45 minutes to buy tickets - this was a weekday, but probably worse than a normal weekday as Eid began the day after. The queues for the main rides were also long, but just on the bearable side.The Leap of Faith slide (kamikaze style - the only ride you do without an inflatable ring) was even faster/crazier than I expected, great stuff, and the other main rides were really good too. But maybe the best part of this place is the Rapids/Torrent/generally all the channels you can float around for hours, hitting fast bits and slow bits and then finding yourself heading up a conveyor belt to start one of the faster rides, which dropped you back down to float off again.Entry is expensive (look for offers) as is the locker charge - we used two lockers between four of us. Despite being there for six hours, we didn't eat but the drinks were relatively reasonably priced for the sort of place and delicious, freshly made, from milkshakes to fresh juices and coffees.Just a great relaxing day with some good, exciting rides thrown in. Would definitely recommend avoiding weekends and holidays - and worth getting there for opening when you could get on all the big rides without queueing, for your first time around anyway!"

All the slides start from the same central \"pyramid\" with the best slides (at least in our opinion) at the top. The Leap of Faith was as fast as advertised and the two seater inflatable rings were a nice touch to allow you to ride alongside a partner / friend. All in all there were seven slides and two sets of \"rapids\", all of which we had finished within 90 minutes of arriving (we had arrived as the park opened to avoid queues, arriving later will mean queues of up to 30 minutes for the more popular rides). After finishing the park we went to the private beach which was very nice with clean sand and crystal clear water. The only issue is with price. We paid over 500 AED (just under \u00a3100) for the day including locker hire. Drinks inside cost the equivalent of \u00a33 for a standard bottle of coke. When you work it out on a per slide / per minute basis it's all rather expensive. Still, once you get over the price it is undoubtedly a fun day out. If you come as a family or intend on doing a lot of tourist-y activities the buy-one-get-one-free offers in the Entertainer will serve to soften the hit on the wallet."

The park is immaculate and the numerous lifeguards are very friendly and always smiling. My kids are 7 and 5 and we felt totally safe all the time even if they were a little out of sight on the rapid rides. There is literally a lifeguard every 30 metres it would seem. Make sure your kids are over 1.20m tall so they can go on the larger rides. Staff are strict with this rule and often check (it is for their safety afterall) My son is 1.25m tall and even so from the top of the Pyramid ride on a blow up tube he was not heavy enough to make it over the first hill, he came to a stop half way up. Again in this instance the lifeguards were immediatly on the radio. As one guard came up the steps at the side the operator turned off the water allowing my son to slide back down. Lifeguard met him at the bottom and got him safely off the ride as I followed down the slide only to meet my son at the end, he was back in the water behind me all smiles. One thing I would say is do not get a locker as they are about 8 pounds for the day. Your possesions should be safe enough left on the sun loungers ours were. Visit soon and enjoy!"

Food and snacks are as one expects at theme parks. Lots of deck chairs and shade to relax under. Ask about discounts to enter as most credit cards as well as residents get some % off the basic ticket price. Yes its expensive to enter but it is quality, safe and very clean. We stayed until the park closed at 6PM opps taxi que was very long so we took the monorail back but it dumps you at a half constructed station called Gateway where if you are lucky you can flag down a taxi on the speeding road outside, but best to walk towards Marina (no footpath so you must walk along the road side for about 1km), to the traffic lights, cross over and you will get plenty of empty taxis within a few minutes."

I had been here along with my friends... the place is nice, organized and but nothing like a Must Visit attraction or something.First thing, i would like to write about is the Restaurant, Shark Bites. We took out meal voucher along with the Entry Tickets... now, being a part of Atlantis, we expected the food to be of better quality and taste. And, when we started eating our burgers, sandwich and fried chicken, to our surprise none of them was good in taste... We even felt the chicken was really stale one and just dint like the food. Their are few small restaurants/shops with in Park, which i felt had better eateries though it was absurdly costly.And, secondly, we wanted to take a few of our photos that was clicked while we used the rides (leap of faith). The cost is AED 75 for a single photo and if we take more than one it is AED 50 each photo. And, when we selected few of our photos, and they said that they could only print the photos and give it to us where as we wanted the soft copy of it. Even after telling them that we would provide them with our USB they still denied it. They say they have a policy that only 10 and more photos could be given in the USB (USB provided by them). We were pretty upset with this... hopefully they come up with a solution for this.Apart from these... we felt It was a nice one day excursion."

Needless to say, we had the time of our lives and we are glad we went. My daughter, husband and I took turns watching over our \"stuff,\" (instead of renting a locker), while the other two sampled the rides. Being left with the stuff isn't so bad because if you position yourself wisely, you can be entertained by people-watching, observing sharks, sting-rays and other fish in a large tank, or just lounging on a sun bed while reading a good book. There are rides and attractions for all ages and sensibilities. And they are very strict about adhering to the 1.2 meter height rule on certain rides. The lines are well organized (think, Disneyland), and even when there are lots of people, the lines move quickly. The park is very clean, lush and green. It is a shame the park closes at dusk, so one has to be in the heat and the sun for this particular adventure. It's expensive at about $70. if you are taller than 1.2m, and about $50. if your child is under 1.2m. Food and meals seem to be eaten outside of the park, but I noticed there are restaurants in the mall next door. This is a perfect place for kids, especially teens, but even us \"adults\" had a really fun time."

The entrance fee is approx \u00a345 per person and considering that the water park only has 7 adult rides (6 of which are waterslides, the 7th is the lazy river with a route to do the rapids section) we found the entrance fee did not offer value for money. Four of the six water slides spit you back out into the lazy river where you can chose to re-enter the slides using a conveyour belt or just continue with the lazy river (and do the rapids if you like). We arrived at the park at around 1015am and found that we had done all the rides by 1145am. The park is not as big as it seems. We found that in the morning, the water levels were a little low which resulted in the rubber rings getting stuck at various points. We were not able to complete a lazy river circuit without getting off our rings and pushing ourselves off the walls. The rapids section on the other hand were a little dangerous. Twice I was flipped over by the current and unfortunately the second time I ended up scraping my arm against the bottom which caused it to bleed and resulted in me having to seek first aid treatment.On entry to the park, your bags are searched by security to ensure you're not bringing in any food or drink. The food sold at the waterpark is of low quality and grossly overpriced (e.g. 2 burgers and 2 chips both with drinks cost us \u00a325). In addition to this locker rental is \u00a310 per locker for the day so all in all it does add up to being a costly day out.Having said all this, the rides - although short were extremely good fun. At times I did feel I was about to flip off the ring due to the sheer speed at which you travel through the tunnels. One ride, namely Shark Attack results in you ending up going through a mini aquarium where you see sharks and rays swimming around. The Leap of Faith - another very good ride does require nerves of steel and if you're a gent - I would advise you to cross your legs at the ankles to avoid being in pain by the water that shoots up between your legs!We didn't experience any big queues but the floor is too hot to walk around comfortably. There were plenty of rings and sunbeds to go around.Having done this once, I don't regret going but I probably wouldn't do it again due to the sheer expense involved. If you compare this to a UK theme park - I believe these offer a lot more value for money."

It is well worth getting a cabana if you are in a large group or meet up wih another family out there as the water and snack are free and it can save you are fortune.

We planned a day out here and so bought our tickets online before leaving UK - on arrival there were no problems.The price of lockers are 40DH (non refundable) a bit steep , but very little alternative. We took towels from the hotel , however, for an extra 10DH you could hire a towel saves lugging a soggy towel around.Having read tripadvisor we bought a cheap pair of wetsuits boots to stop our feet from burning on the concrete paths when moving from various rides - and I highly recommend UVA/UVB t shirts as the sun even whilst bobbing around the lazy river was blisteringly hot. There is a shop onsite next to changing rooms to buy these items if you choose.There is a monorail which services Atlantis to the begining of the Palm- however, taxis are plentiful and cheap.we spent approx 3hrs there (we are both mature 40 year olds) before the heat and tiredness got to us .thoroughly recommend it"

It must have been a quieter day as we were ther from opening till after 6pm. The slides are pretty exciting and the rapids and \"torrent\" ride are nice lengthy lazy river rides. Although food and drinks are a little pricey we went expecting this to be honest. It is simple business sense and is probably the same at almost any other attraction in almost every other country. The staff were very helpful. We only used one locker and found it fine to store everything as we didn't need anything with us except sun cream. We put some money on our wristbands in preparation when entering so I didn't have to keep going back for my wallet.We also did the dolphin experience which was amazing in itself.Would recommend to anyone. Also, you cannot leave without doing the \"Leap of Faith\"!!!!!"

Having been to the likes of blizzard beach in florida my family and I were looking forward to aquaventure as most attractions in dubai are bigger and better than the rest of the world. The cost of \u00a340 ish per head wasn't too bad considering location etc but that's were the plus sides ended. Overcrowded, not enough beds/loungers, free for all with the water 'doughnuts' one set of lockers per sex at the beginning of the park so you had to trek to and from if you needed any valuables ie money. The main bug bear was the cost of water/soft drinks, as dubai is very hot and you need to keep yourself hydrated this place maximizes on the fact that you cant bring your own, at \u00a310 for 3 small (330ml) bottles of water I consider it to be extortionate, so must other people because when we left a bag with two unopened bottles on a lounger while we went for a swim someone stole them, left the googles, hat etc but pinched the water. There are only 4 or 5 slide options all in the same area, there is a small section dedicated for smaller children which looked quite good. there are rapids, and a lazy river, so lazy you have to get out and walk or have someone push you. Would i go back no, wish I had tried wild wadi as I think you are paying for the Atlantis name and nothing else. Best past of \u00a3200 wasted for an afternoon for 3 people."

It is great for families, couples and friends. We went just the two of us (my fianc\u00e9e and I) and we could laze about in the rubber rings and alternate with a bit of an adrenaline rush on the rides. The rapids were really fun and not scary for a wimp like me. The top rides though aren't THAT scary- even for me. My fianc\u00e9e went on the 'leap of faith' water slide and he only did it once, he said it was a bit boring. Downsides are that you have to carry your rubber ring around with you and also that the ground is very rough and BURNING hot!! Also, be careful in the sea, I ran out almost instantly because there were jelly fish- the beach was pretty much empty. The lifeguard did move it out of the way though. We went on a week day, so it was really easy to find a secluded spot as most people sunbathe close to all the slides, we went a little further out and almost had our own private pool. We would definitely recommend visiting, even just to experience being at Atlantis. The location and the way it has been done is really beautiful. Would we go back? Probably only to stay at the hotel, but it should definitely be tried at least once!"

We were in the water pretty much all day, only coming out briefly to re-apply suncream and grab some lunch! A lot of the rides are joined together so you can bob along through the rivers from one to the next on your inflatable ring (or double ring with your swim buddy). There is plenty of shade and lots of sunbeds so whether to bronze or not is your choice. The food is expensive but you would expect this in a place like this I think. There are lockers that you can hire (which we did) and you can charge your wristband up with money so you don't need to keep going back to your locker to get money when you want drinks.I would recommend you get there as early as you can to make the most of the day, and prepare to have a great time! Oh and the floor is absolutely roasting so either wear water shoes or leave your flip flops near the edge somewhere (they will be quite safe as everyone does this) otherwise you'll be cursing all the way back to your sunbed!"

It also closes at sundown, which is a shame.but...it is fantastic!took a 3 year old and a 7 year old.Both had a great time. The lazy river and rapids, along with the kids play park kept the 3 year old busy for hours, and the 7 year old was old enough to go on all the rides, and loved the Leap of Faith! Fortunately, there are less fun police there than at the equivalent in the US or UK or Europe, where there would be a ridiculous age restriction on the fun stuff!so, go, have a good time, but avoid the food and drink - take your own (probably not allowed, but do it anyway!)"

After procrastinating for two years, thinking my kids (7 and timid, and 3) were too little for this all-singing, all-dancing waterpark, we tried it out. It is brilliant, even for the little ones.The 3YO was too small to go on the big rides (you have to be 1.2m high) but still really enjoyed the \"lazy\" river - i say \"lazy\" because there are rapids and torrents that make it very exciting. You could honestly spend all day circuiting the park in a ring - it's such fun. The 7YO liked the kids' water structure play thing, but the 3YO did not. There isn't much shade, there, either, so we all go a bit hot and bothered.it's an expensive day out, but worth it, especially if you take up any special offers they're running. Much better than its competitors in Dubai, Umm Al Quwain and Ras al Khaimah.Food was average, probably slightly better than I expected (the pizzas are very good). If you purchase food vouchers in advance at the ticket sales office, it's a bit cheaper (AED45 for combo meal) than buying it inside."

Beside all the nice rapids and slides, it has spectacular pristine beach which is a must if you visit Aquaventure. Please keep in mind that you are not allowed to take any kind of drinks with you to the park. I think it is not fair since the coffeeshops inside are veryyyyy expensive. You had to pay 40Dhs only for one small juice. The guards at the front door took our drinks and told us that you are not allowed to drink them outside the gate since it was Ramadan. But only one step from that point, you could drink. Don't forget to take your flipflops with you since the earth is boiling at summer. Overall, I think Atlantis is better than wildwadi in terms of the people who visit there."

We hired a locker and towels although we didn't really use them. The lockers are right by the entrance, so it's easier to change and leave everthing there and just go back when you need something.We picked a sunlounger, put our towels down the grabbed a rubber ring and set off on the runs. The main run is a loop around the park with exits/enterances to the sunloungers so make a note of where you put yours as it looks the same. There is no shortage of lifequards, every section is well covered. By lunchtime it was busy and there was a shortage of rubber rings but they do appear after a short wait. At lunchtime we got changed and went into the hotel to eat. The food area is screened off but you can still eat. We had a wonderful Wagu burger which set us up for the afternoon. After applying more suncreen,which is a must as there were alot of burnt shouders,we managed to do all the slides. The Leap Of Faith was closed but I wasn't going to do it anyway!

The tubes needs more air and they need to find ways too cool down the walking surfaces with water sprays as walking barefoot between rides is like fire walking. Take a lesson from Wild Wadi they spray most of the exposed surfaces with fine water jets. Overall a fun place with hard working and friendly staff who do a great job keeping the place running smoothly."

The only thing was that when you got out of the water the ground was so hot it felt like the skin was burning off your feet. The locker rooms are a really good idea and the fact that they had showers with shampoo and body wash and they provided hair dryers for all visitors to use in the locker rooms gets a big plus. A BIG tip if going in the summer months is take and wear lots of sunscreen, the sun there is lethal."

The thrill of the rides is brilliant but of those who want to sunbathe theres places for that too! Lots of sun loungers with shades if wanted, but also access to the beach, which is really relaxing and peaceful. There are a few fast food restaurants in the park for drinks and food, but also a beach bar on the beach that serves drinks, shisha and fruit, on bean bags on the sand, which is lovely! The waterpark rides were so much fun, cannot wait to go back! Try the big ones, they may take guts to get on but they are so worth it! The river and rapids are lots of fun too - see how many times you can get around without falling out of your rubber ring - IT'S A CHALLENGE!! ENJOY!"

There are great rides, everything is really clean, staff are friendly and the lazy river is the best I have seen. Some reviews I read complained about the difficulty of finding free sunbeds or how they had to \"hold on to their rubber rings\". Having just visited in June I can honestly say these complaints are nonsense. We arrived at around lunch time so it was already busy and we found two free sunbeds in one of the larger pool areas within around 3 minutes. The sunbeds are great as they have individual canopies so you can shade yourself from the sun whenever you wish. As for the other complaint about having to watch your rubber ring - there were literally 20-30 free rings every time we got in to the pool.If you have children this is a fantastic place to bring them for the day. I have never seen so many lifeguards - there is a lifeguard posted almost every 50 meters.The two things I enjoyed most were The Torrent and The Rapids - both were part of the lazy river. They are suitable for young kids too once accompanied by an adult, but great fun for adults too. I spent most of my day on these while my husband did some of the more adventurous rides such as the Leap of Faith.It is reasonably expensive but really worth visiting!"

Also at Aquaventure you have to carry your tube around with you all day, where at WW you just collect them at every ride."

We went there with a group of 10 people with the youngest 3 year and the oldest over 70 and all age group in between. It was lots of fun. Everyone enjoyed the rides, the slides and the river rides, etc. To avoid the summer heat, we went late afternoon and the place was totally crowded but very well behaved. Now the but part starts:1. With the kind of entrance fees charged you would expect at least one free towel but we had to pay for it. Ridiculous2. For a group of 10, I would expect a free locker but we had to pay for it. More Ridiculous3. The main ride area was closed at 6:28 pm. Can you even imagine this? The park staff wanted to 'clean' the pool on my ticket time. The official closing time is 7 pm. Extremely Ridiculous4. The river ride area has a Rapid section which was closed at 6:40 pm and I was told that this is normal. He asked me do I want to risk my life without a life guard in that section? The normal closing time is 7 pm. Do I need to say this is most ridiculous thing I have ever heard."

The staff were friendly and helpful. The only negative for me was the lack of shade anywhere in the park on a hot day with three children under 6 the heat became a little unbearable. Every sunbed has a canopy attached to it which you can pull over the top of the ed but this didn't really provide any real shelter from the miday heat."

Other than the young kids play area there are about 6 rides including the leap of faith and are all fairly similar, but still good fun. We got there as it opened at 10 and for an hour or so its not too busy and you can get on the rides easily. By 11.30 it was packed and for this coming later hand this it is very hard to find sunbeds and rings for the rides(particularly the double rings). The rides require rubber rings and unlike other parks we\u2019ve been to you don\u2019t collect your ring at the start of the ride and give it back at the end you keep it. if you have a break and sit on a sunbed for a while the rings can get pinched if you\u2019re not watching them. The park is very clean and all in all as long as you get there early it\u2019s great for a couple of hours but not as good as wet and wild in the states."

Dont miss the highlight, The Leap of faith! iTS 27.5 M tall, and 61m long it catapults you to a shark filled lagoon , dont worry they wont bite you you only get to see them through the transparent tunnel.. it looks really scary from afar specially when you see riders screaming (and cut short shrieks).. but when you get to the top it's even more scary hehehe..but you will love doing it again and again.. we never had a chance to try it again though cause it was the last day of a long holiday and people are just everywhere... The entire day i guess was not enough for us to try everything so be early !Since dubai has a tormenting summer specially between june-sept be ready with your loads of sunscreen and water to keep you hydrated!Food is available ,lockers( hair dryer available) provided but for a fee.

We went to Atlantis, and decided to spend the extra to get private Cabana, and were pleased we did (although I suspect that the Japanese family who were unceremoniously booted out by the staff to make our cabana available were less pleased). I just wish we had arrived earlier in the day to get the best out of the rides, which are amazing. We all had a blast - especially our kids (9 and 12)."

It's a bit pricey but there are plenty of rides for the kids and adults... My favourite is leap of faith - a must do for all adults !... The park is very well maintained and the staff around is very Friendly... the park also has its own artifical beach... I would recommend to bring your own towels... and just rent the lockers. There are plenty of good places to eat but all are costly so be prepared to pay a bit extra for the food... Overall a must when in Dubai."

We arrived at approx 9:30am on a Friday and it was very quiet so we managed to get sun loungers no problem. By about 10:30 - 11:00am it became very busy and almost all of the sunloungers in the main areas had become full. There were some others further along that weren't too busy.We didn't seem to have a problem getting one of the rings to go on the rapids, the double rings for two people seemed to go very quickly. Usually you don't have to wait around for the rings, but as it got busier, sometimes it took about 5-10 minutes to wait for one. I did notice some families, hogging their rings, i.e. sitting on their loungers for some time with their rings piled up next to them.The rapids were very good as were the waves. The slides are interesting. My husband got me to go on the slides, one of them which I think was the Stinger? scared the life out of me. I couldn't talk after it had finished, it was the first part, it was really steep and then plunged into darkness going down and round. Shark attack was more my kind of thing, not to steep, but still pretty quick and you finish in a glass tunnel surrounded by sharks, rays and other marine life. The rides are great fun, and for me a little scary, but I had a great time! I did notice towards the middle of the afternoon queues for some of the rides started to get bigger. One thing I did notice that they didn't really just have a swimming pool which would be a good idea. Otherwise it is the slides and rapids only.You can also have access to the beach which isn't that busy and lots of sun loungers. Prices for drinks and food is ok, not overly expensive. They have changing rooms and showers available and you can also hire towels (30 AED each) and lockers (40AED each) too.The Metro is also linked to Atlantis which can make it easier to get too. They also have a taxi rank outside with metered taxis."

            "review": "Expensive 'must do'. We visited in April 2012. It was hot and the water park seemed like a good idea to whale the time away. The ticket queue was long and slow (65min slow). The wrist band entry passes didn't charge the first time so back in the queue... The Lockers are located next to the main entrance, difficult to operate and they are very, very far from the slides and swimming. It is impossible to take any bags, sun screen, water or money with you as there is nowhere else to leave your items. So, long trips to the lockers...Food on the premises is of the 'fast food' type - unappetizing, overpriced, long queue to order, long wait for it to be ready....The Lazy River going around the park is great for all ages - slow, relaxing floating in a rubber ring. You can mix it up by venturing into the Rapids - few twists and shakes, faster speed and more fun. There are various 'scary' slides that add a bit of punch and excitement to otherwise very commercial operation. Not all the slides are suitable for everyone and younger children are very limited in choice. This place would be most suitable for teenagers and young adults. Be prepared to get hot, frustrated, spend a lot of money and queue for everything. There is very little shade and it is best avoided during the hottest months (May-Oct). If you use a Taxi, please try to use the standard marked Taxis with a sign and not the Hotel assigned cab company. Hotel cabs are very difficult to trace if you lose something or want to comment, and they don't operate by the same Service Contracts and Standards."

Whilst the sun loungers are a bit packed in they have individual sun shades which is handy. Something for all ages here, tots swimming pool and water play area and the slides are somewhat more thrilling than those we have encountered in the US esp for a relatively small park, leap of faith and even the rapids are not tame.Its a bit pricey, unless you are resident as entry free if staying at Atlantis the Palm. The deal on entry, towel and locker saves a few dirhams. Once inside drinks are ice creams are high end price.Unlike other water parks, here folks held onto their 'own' rubber ring, as they dont seem to have them available at the start of the ride. So we saw them stack up at the side of the 'owners' sun loungers. Top tip - bring water park shoes / flip flops as bare feet are at high risk of burning on the stone and concrete floors."

So I ended up in the emergency room, half drowned with bruises, scrapes and 2 toes gashed open. My husband also lost his new Ray Bans.Lifegaurd asked us not to put in a complaint as he didnt want to be fired and then deported so we didn't. I now have a foot full of deep scars thanks to him.

The children water play area is good, and we enjoyed the wave pool and the river rides that are connected to it. Being still little, they could ride the 'scarier' rides of course, and we were content to go to the private beach where we spent a good part of the day swimming, picking sea shells and building sand castles. My hubby and I took turns to be with them, while one of us go off for the challenging rides like leap of faith, shark attack, the surge etc. I think if it's just me and my hubby, we would have finished all the rides very fast. But the no. of rides (really not many), and the private beach makes this a suitable water theme park for those with young children, who aren't so much into exciting rides anyway. The family entertainer book have 1 for 1 vouchers for the shark bites restaurant inside the park. Useful for lunch. :)"

Also, a lot more relaxed. I enjoyed the wave pool and some of the tunnel rides, also the flotation pool with very heavy salt water. Very relaxing, friendly atmosphere. They also have some bungalos, so you can rent them to spend a night. The food choices have also improved, compared to earlier years. Take your family and enjoy a relaxing day with loads of water."

I smacked my head very hard on the bottom, but thankfully remained conscious and was able to quickly lift my son above the water as we were floated further down the river (he was in a life jacket but had quite a scare).There was no life guard when we turned over but when we got to the nearest one, I asked for help. He was in no rush to assist. Thankfully my son was uninjured, but I asked for medical assistance because of the hard hit to my head - the medic took several minutes to arrive (I was told the medical station was all the way at the other side of the waterpark), and essentially told me to walk it off since I wasn't bleeding. From the life guard to the medic, there just seemed to be absolutely no urgency or concern. I shudder to think how long it would have taken the life guards to get my son out of the water (or me for that matter) had I been knocked out."

Then when you're brave enough you head up to the Leap Of Faith.... and it really is that. A near vertical drop followed by being surrounded by marine life in the aquarium, whilst travelling at speed. An unreal waterslide.It really is fun for the whole family, and is recommended to anyone aged from 6 to 60.Great facilities, locker and towel hire and photos available that are taken around the whole park. The photos are expensive though, and the best ones are always from the leap of faith!I'll definitley be returning on my next visit to Dubai."

Warning the water isn't heated so it's a tad cold. I did every ride but the big one, The Leap of Faith. I stood in line for that ride but chickened out. The rides are pretty good, much better than water parks I've been to in the US. The wait lines aren't too bad, at least they weren't bad when we were there, but I bet it's different in Aug. Also the entrance to the park includes beach access. Sadly the ocean water wasn't warm so I didn't get to take advantage of the beach. You can relax and smoke Shisha on the beach. Also they sell alcohol at the park, you can get a beer to a Pina Colada. I can't wait to go back to Dubai so we can go back here again. Also this place is located on the tip of the man made island, The Palm. So expect a bit of a scenic drive through The Palm"

My husband and I are in our late 20s but this experience made us feel like 10 year olds.Amazing lazy rivers that stretch for ages and ages with twists and turns, waves, river rapids, bumpy turns, soft swirly bits.My husband and I spent nearly 2 hours just floating about on a double rubber ring in the lazy river.Was the most fun ever!Amazingly well organised with a lifeguard posted practically every 2 meter stretch.My husband even spotted some kind of park officer who randomly throws in plastic baby dolls to see how quickly life guards who have been sitting around all day, spot it and react!Good news is they did and they do!Very attentive , very safe, smoothest set up I have ever seen.The drops and tunnels were amazing. There is even a ride where you float through a tube in a massive aquarium through a shark's enclossure. How random!Excellent day out, beautiful pools and loungers everywhereFood is a bit expensive (2 hotdogs and fries meals came to about \u00a326)My gripe is that the overall day out however is VERY expensive, heres a break down:1) Burger meal for 2 = \u00a330 2) Park entrance for 2 = 400DHM = \u00a3753) Towel hire for 2 = 30DHM = \u00a354) Locker for 1=40DHM = \u00a37Altogether its not a cheap day and if you factor in the cost of getting a cab to the Atlantis also, its quite a big cost!My husband and I had the best time ever but we did say we would struggle to recommend this to our friends or family who have kids because it would cost a fortune for a whole family.I think perhaps it maybe worth it to get it all for free if you are staying at the AtlantisAmazing day out, I havent been to Florida Disneyland but I picture this is what it would be likeWe only had to queue for 1 ride and it was a short queue, nothing like the close to 90 min queues for rides at Alton Towers UK.Very safe and very smooth setup as mentioned beforeBut perhaps safe a few quid by bringing your own towels and sharing lockers.Food you have to pay for though because you are not allowed to take in any food."

Our family has been dedicated to Wild Wadi for years but we thought that going to Atlantis would be a fun new experience this time around. We were right! The beach was beautiful and the kids enjoyed seeing the fish jumping and swimming around them. There were plenty of beach chairs and they had covers so you could easily shield yourself from the heat. Downside, there were no chairs to be found near the pool areas. If you do not arrive as soon as the park opens, you will need to set up on the beach. The rides led into the rapids and lazy river so you could stay in the water forever! Shark Attack and the Leap of Faith are the only rides that do not lead into the river. Shark Attack is a great slide for all ages since it goes through a transparent tube where you can see the fish, mantas and sharks swimming all around you. The lines were reasonable. The longest line was for the Leap of Faith but even then, it was only about 10 minutes. We went in the middle of the week so the crowds were not bad. I would not recommend going on a Friday or Saturday. You might want to bring your own towels as there is a 45 AED charge (about 12 USD) for renting a towel at the park. There is also a 45 AED charge for a locker which we paid and never used. Our things were fine on the beach chairs. Meals were reasonably priced and you can add a meal to your admission fee upon arrival for 45 AED. The park closes at sunset which is around 6pm but I recommend leaving just before that. The line at this time for the taxi is very long and does not move quickly at all. There is a monorail that will take you the the opening of the Palm Island where you can find a taxi easily."

The kids area was nice and plenty to kerp the 2 year old occupied. The beach area is nice and clean and was faulty quiet so the little one enjoyed it too. The only downside to the place is the cost (without vouchers)it's about 210 dirhams plus 50 dirhams for towel and locker. The list chambers aquarium was a further 100 dirhams plus food and drinks are very expensive. The 2 years was free though which was good! The entertainers vouchers book have but 1 get 1 free vouchers for entrance to the park for towel and Lockers and for the shark bites resteraunt aswell so with the voucher the whole day was a lot more bearable to the pocket! And in the end well worth it! The queues for the taxis is quite long at the end of the day however we had arranged a private taxi to do a drop off and pick whenever we liked this saved us having to wait in the queue and the price wasn't much different to what we would have paid for a normal, the taxi driver just asked us to call him an hour before pickup. (windows tours did the private taxi for 150 AED pick up and drop off from bur dubai Arabian courtyard) All in all with the vouchers was a very good day out!"

As it is at at hotel it's also licensed so you can grab a beer in the sun. The lazy river is great and the staff along the way like to mess about and push your ring into the waterfalls etc.Money saving tips..Get an ice-cream on the way in at the Cold Stone then tell the kids to pipe down later on when they are asking for a \u00a311 ice pop later in the parkTake Towels, It's either 30 or 40dhs which is \u00a35-7 and for a family of 4 who've already paid over \u00a3150 to get in adding another 20+ just for towels can be a bit frustrating.Lockers are also \u00a37, but then on the grand scheme of things that's a lot cheaper than the (very slim) chance of someone taking your wallet/phone/watch.

We would have never though doing that one day but all is so secured! Major central placd with all slides in limited up to 120 cm but so fun ! Do not be afraid to take all sides of slides as even last,we discovered new places! Every lunch cost approx 40\u20ac as special rate for kids and for us one meal at choice : salad, wrap, hamburger... Surprise as not expected as every body was talking about high prices ( in fact only drinks cost ! So go and anticipate by having water in advance always).

I went in aquadventure water park on February in order to enjoy the attractions but I don't find them so amazing... there are just two nice slides, the other ones are nothing special. there are better and cheaper aquatic park in other places ( for example Aquafan in Riccione, Italy, is amazing!) Than this one... Aquaventure is nothing comparing with any other thing in Dubai."

Buying the tickets - the cashier couldn't give me the correct brochure to show me what rides/attractions the water park had. In the end when it got too hard for her, she just said 'we've run out'. The lockers for AED 40 each - no signage or instructions about how to use the locker, so we had to go outside hunting around for someone to help you only to be met by a lady who was too busy talking to a fellow colleague to help us. She then grunted something and went back to talking to her friend, leaving me standing there. For a first timer the whole park experience is rather confusing - you need to know what to do/where to go as there is no 'journey' or easy way to find out what to do/where to go - instead you end up walking backwards and forwards picking up rings and asking park staff who rarely can answer a basic question. Otherwise the park was clean and it was quite a nice way to kill 3 hours."

We visited Aquaventure using the entertainer vouchers (only one coupon for adult admission, one for kids and one for locker and towel) Bring your own towel if you want to save on that This is a state of the art aquatic park very well designed to cater for all needs. There are plenty of rides even for adults that are not so thrilled at this sort of activities. You can charge some money on your bracelet and pay for food and cocktails with it. There is also a nice chicha bar on the beach Avoid the sun loungers at the pool as they are packed tighly on five rows and cater mainly to families with small children. The beach is really nice with plenty of available sun loungers each with its own \u201cumbrella\u201d. Food is ordered and delivered at your feet with a golf cart Avoid the ride back with the palm shuttle train as there is no taxi at the exit (only a few private cars).

Also because of the hotels location on the end of the palm it is very hot and although the sunbeds all have canopies little has been done to provide any proper shade.The one good thing that came out of the day trip was that it answered our questions as to whether we would want to stay at Atlantis Hotel in the future, the answer to that is no, the whole place seemed very badly planned, not user firendly and not as interestng as all of the media hype suggests, there are many much better hotels in Dubai. The food here is expensive and poor (Disney style fast food on the whole)If you are choosing bewteen a day at Wild Wadi and a day at Aquaventure go for Wild Wadi!!"

Rides are all intertwined, it was so hard to meet up again if people went off on different rides, and even the lifeguards couldn't really tell you where riders would come out on the other side! The other problem we had was injuries - we all got bruised or bashed on the stone walls, and we saw the medic dealing with at least 4 other people. One poor Russian lady sat next to me for 10 mins waiting for the medic with blood all down her leg - I made her elevate it on her rubber ring and got her some paper towels from the ladies loos! So my advice would be take it easy, take some plasters with you, enjoy Shark Attack which was hilarious, and stay together as a group! By the way, if you're staying at the hotel, you need a blue wristband to get in, which you get from the 1st ticket window on your left. And to view photos after you leave, go to the entrance to the Lost Chambers aquarium and scan your other, yellow wristband."

If you get tired of the waves, the there is Beach access thrown in and a visit to dolphin bay are a must as we saw the dolphins and they are beautiful.

The slopes are great fun and doable for everyone. The wave area is really exciting. Take at least half a day to enjoy it. It is cooled water in summer which you need and very nice to chill out."

At the time of writing it was 200AED for an adult day pass (\u00a336) and definitely worth it. The leap of faith slide is incredible and definitely worth a try and also find the shalam slide which is on the other side of the wooden pagoda to the other slides and is probably one of the best ones. Its a two person ride though so pick up a double ring before you get down there as its a bit of a walk. Plenty of space and sunbeds for relaxing, waiter service for food and drinks to your sunbed. Great service, staff really friendly, great fun! Only downside is that the lockers were 7AED each which is only \u00a31.50 but its non refundable and considering its supposed to be one of the worlds best and a 5* water park you'd think they gave you a locker for free - my local council swimming baths even give you your pound back! We shared a locker between 3 with smallish beach bags containing suncream, book, ipod etc, you can easily share one between two."

Aquaventure was a bit of a nightmare in the sense that to get on the rides quicker, you had to carry the dinghy up a few flights of stairs, and the ground was absolutely roasting under your feet! The Leap Of Faith is the main slide that goes through the water tunnel with the fish and sharks etc, but if you're a contact lens wearer like me, don't try and open your eyes to see the fish, my lens ripped with the force of the water splashing back.The food and drink was relatively basic fast food, chips, burgers, sandwiches etc, and it was quite expensive. It's the same idea as Wild Wadi with the electronic wrist bands so you don't need to carry soggy bank notes about with you.All in all, a good day but if i was to return to Dubai, i'd go back to Wild Wadi. Better rides, friendlier staff, slightly cheaper and great views of the Burj."

The rides were fun, especially the Leap of Faith, and we enjoyed lounging at the beach as well. A couple of things to keep in mind if you go (based on my one-day experience, which may not be reflective of the everyday situation): * Get there early and go on the rides first, doing the dolphin encounter later. When we arrived there was literally no line for Leap of Faith, in the afternoon we waited more than 20 minutes. * Plan your transportation back. The taxi cue at 5pm was unbelievably long. Arrange in advance for a taxi pickup or a hotel car, or plan to stay a bit longer, maybe getting dinner somewhere at the Atlantis (we went to the buffet at Kaleidoscope and enjoyed it). There was no queue at 8pm."

If you are an adult and plan on riding the rapids do not use the single rings with a bottom in the middle. You end up with too high a centre of gravity and WILL get thrown out of the ring. This hurts. Roll onto your back and let the water carry you to a calmer area. Don't try to stand up in the rapids as you will fall over again and look like an idiot.

Also loved that we were floating around the water park in twin floaters with bottoms to hold children even as young as infants. The bobbing up and down the water just makes them want to sleep. There are areas just for children of small ages that they seem like they were having so much fun. The water photographer takes lovely pictures as you are swimming but the photo prices are very expensive. You would rather take your own pictures. It is also cheaper to combine the lost chamber and aquaventure ticket."

If you are planning a vacation with young children, you cannot go wrong with staying at the Atlantis.The park is well-maintained and well-run. It is clean and the equipment is new. The slides, handrails, beach furniture, towels and floats are all clean and new. The theme-ing, meaning the landscaping and the facades in the park are all clean and well-maintained. You don't get the feeling that you're walking into an ageing theme park that's seen better days and where you have to worry about the safety of your young. That's the other thing, there are lifeguards with ambu-bags, life-floats and first aid fanny packs every which way you turn.Staff are friendly and helpful and professional; no bored teenagers working summers here. We got turned away at the Ziggurat for not meeting the height requirement, 1cm shy, but I appreciated the staff for doing their jobs and keeping the park and rides safe.The center attraction is the Ziggurat which has 4 rides, the biggest and most famous of which is the Leap of Faith. You can always catch season 18 of the Amazing Race for a demo. Awesome! The rides all end up in the \"River\" which has a course that runs all around the park picking up riders. You can get in or out at many points along the course and all over the park. You can choose to lazily float along and eventually choose to follow a tidal driven course (Torrents), where huge waves come along and rush you along the course or Rapids where you go down a series of rapids which simulates a white-water experience.There are single floats or tubes and Two-bies (what the kids and I called them).There's also a Kid's Island with a huge drenching bucket, slides of all sorts and wildly-colored water spouts, faucets and sprinklers. Also the warmest part of the park if you're visiting in winter."

The most amazing water park I have been to :) it was great for families even with diff age groups, from my 3yr old cousin to my 90 year old grandfather - Everyone had a great time!My grandfather didnt swim though, but he was happy roaming around on his wheelchair.If you don't want to bring your own towel, you can get the locker and towel combination for 50aed. Locker is at 40aed each, just add 10aed more for the towel. Pretty pricey for a locker.We only got a few lockers to put our valuables and the rest that cant fit anymore, we brought it with us and left it on a beach chair and luckily nothing was lost even after leaving it for hours unsupervised.The locker room is pretty small to accomodate the whole park, there was a long line for the showers and changing rooms - at the end of the day. Cold but the water was warm and nice. Its cold when your wet and your walking around to transfer attractions/pools, or waiting for your turn on the slides. They have a beach with a great view, but the sand is not nice. We were allowed to bring water inside the park. The park was open from 10am - 530pm. Wish we had more time :)"

They search your bags with a stick so you could perhaps be a little flexible with what you take in - if you get my drift! I believe you are allowed to take in a bottle of water They could do with better signs for getting around and working out the rides.It was pretty chilly with a bit of a wind on the day we went - I wouuld not reccomment anyone goes on a day like this it was flippin freezing at times and the wind really blows when you are up a tower!! The whole thing works on a big river that you can use a ring to go around the park and all of the rides feed in to this. There is a tower and there are about 5 rides that come from that. One of the rides requires you to have a double ring but we did not know this until we had walked for some distance to the start ! finding the start is an adventure of its own :( We also got the the begining of some of the rides to find that they had no rings.... Take your ring with you and make sure you find a pumped up one! We walked some way to find one of the 2 eateries only to find it closed so again quite a long walk to find the other.. Burgers is the choice.They have changing rooms, lots of small lockers with a nifty locking system. the ladies had cubicles for changing and about 8 showers. 8 toilets and 5 sinks with the mirrors above them. Thats it. I feeel that the facilities were very inadequate, it was full and the park was not busy as it was a cool day, I cant imagine what it would be like on a busy day. The rides were fun and a good work out as you walk quite a bit. We had a good time on them The beach area is lovely and there a several areas to sit and chill and watch the people drift by all with great free sun beds.I did not make it to Wild Wadi so cant compareI would only go again on a hot day!"

It is interconnected with other towers and steep water slides for the adrenaline junkies!! For the faint at heart, you can just keep floating away with the inbuilt wave pool, carrying you and the 10 second huuuge wave lifting you and literally creating a splash!! I forgot my age and where I was, when I was carried into this huge underwater passageway and let loose my lung power when the wave carried me away!!!

All in all we had a great time, and for us (a young couple late twenties/early thirties) we preferred this to Wild Wadi Park, also an enjoyable park, but one we found to be much more family orientated and busy. The rides at Aquaventure were generally fast and quite exciting and there were plenty of sun loungers to be found, so need to stress out and about getting there early.One of the best attractions is the Lazy River which is vast and includes some nice rapids along the way and of course a ride which plunges you into an aquarium. Facilities at the park were good and well maintained. Cost:* Price of an adult ticket is not cheap - 200 DHS per adult, so a Buy One Get One Free voucher from the Entertainer book is advisable. * Towel rental is 30 DHS  Locker rental 40 DHS  A towel and a locker together is 50 DHS.* Food was quite dear but par for the course for these types of places. We paid 110 DHS for two meals (Fried chicken, chips and a drink). Food at Wild Wadi was cheaper and a lot nicer - there an average meal seems to cost around 35 DHS compared to 55 at AV. * Don't underestimate how long it will take you to get there and how much it will cost. Unless you live or stay around the Palm, you must factor in about 50 DHS for a taxi. The Monorail which leads to the park, also costs 15 DHS one way, per person but has some very nice views. Park Atmosphere:Despite going at the weekend (Friday), the park was really quiet and we barely had to wait any time for the rides at all - normally an average of 5 minutes per ride at most! The one exception was when a group of five people held up the whole queue by asking the flume controller to pump up each of their inflatable rings. They should really have a separate station for this as we waited 15 minutes until he was finished and resumed sending people down the ride!The rides were all very good but I can understand when people say that the park lacks variety. Many were very similar, it is true and it is a shame that they didn't have a few more different rides, such as the ones, one finds at Wild Wadi.Pros:* Fast rides* Nice atmosphere* Very little waiting time* Not too crowded* Good changing facilities and showers* The ride through the aquarium was wonderful and very memorableCons:* Could be more rides* Park expensive without a voucher* Not as well organised as Wild Wadi - no maps were supplied* Food quite expensive and of questionable quality.Summary:Having tried and enjoyed both Aquaventure and Wild Wadi, we prefer the former, simply because the rides are more exciting and better thought out and because the queue time seems to be much better. Families with children, however, are probably better off going to Wild Wadi, as there are more child friendly rides and the food is cheaper.Overall, we would give the park 4.5 out of 5."

Leap of faith, shark attack, grand rapids, and all the rest - single or double person tubes, there were more than ample available- lines were short on this Thurs- given wrist bands which operate the lockers, saw several people having trouble operating this- beach is picturesque with good photo opportunities (nice background skyline)- no idea about food, didn't eat there"

To be fair, let me tell you that we first went to Wild Wadi and visited Aquaventure a cpl of days later - and were truly disappointed with it - especially when compared to the facilities...will leave the fun part aside.Firstly, there werent many tubes around as we were looking to enter the rapids. I was with my wife and son (7yrs) and when I asked for assistance, the guy said tersely - I got to find myself. Told him that I could not find any and he acted to look but gave me a look enuff that sorry, I cant help on this. We managed just one double tube and thought best that my wife go with my son and I will follow later when I get one - which I got one after 2 hours!Secondly, the food options are very limited and are very expensive! For AED 70, you get half melon, half pine apple and one coconut water.Third - it was hot when we went there - and the ground was scorching. True, you cant help that - but Wild Wadi had an answer to it - they had sprinklers all around that kept the ground wet and conducive to walk.Fourth - You can rent a towel for AED 70 (again expensive - can buy one in that) - but perhaps Aquaventure dosent believe in giving its guests a refreshing experience after the end of the day! Sample this - the doors in the shower are transparent with a mild opaque film, but yes ppl outside can see thru, there are no latches/ locks inside the shower room and there are no hooks either! Sad indeed."

We were really pleasantly surprised to find out that the water park entrance was included too. We were in the water park within about half-an-hour of it opening and had a brilliant time. Never had to stand in a queue for longer than five minutes or so. Most of the rides, we just managed to get straight on. After about a couple of hours, you could begin to see the park was getting V busy and the queues were getting crazy long. Def get there early to enjoy your 'space'.The loungers are quite a pain to get hold of. We were okay as we got there early (as I have already mentioned hundreds of times...sorry!) and we did what everyone else did...just put our towels, sun lotion...unvaluable items on the loungers and kept them as 'ours' - yes, definitely very cheeky, but that's what majority of the people were doing, so it was the only way to ensure we had somewhere to sit/lye down. The guards are quite cool - we had a little cheap Kodak waterproof disposable camera and they took pics of us - am on the wrong laptop right now...will upload some photos later.The female changing rooms were very crowded by the time we were leaving, so if you prefer a private cubicle, you'll probably have to wait a few moments."

            "review": "Fab day out for any ages (family or couples) and the Dolphins were fantastic!. We read the reviews and went to the waterpark on a Wednesday and arrived at the Atlantis for when it opened at 10am.First, we checked in (we had pre-paid, as we booked a dolphin adventure so we got free water park entry included in this.) Then we each got a wrist band and we each put 100 on it and bought a locker. We put our stuff in a locker and went straight out to stick our towels & flip flops on a sun lounger and grabbed a double tube! We went on all the rides, there was no queue at this time of day. You can use a floaty-tube on all of them apart from the highest one, which you have to go down alone and tube-less! We had a fantastic time, and went on the rides & the lazy river up until about 1pm, when it started to get busy and there were queues forming on the rides. Thankfully, we wisely booked our dolphin adventure for 2ish so we abandoned the tubes, had a bite to eat & a drink and went to 'Dolphin Bay.' Although the double tubes were popular, we found that we saw a lot of them abandoned at the exits to the lazy river, so we would not have had a problem getting another one if we let go of the one we had. We also arrived back to our sun loungers to find our towels & flipflops still there (we had read reviews about things getting stolen, but this was not the case and we chose sunloungers in one of the central/busy locations.) We just brought a couple of our hotel towels with us, and are glad we did not bother buying/renting any. After walking around, down to view the beach, and having a quick bite to eat, we were both pretty much dry. We visited in November, and did not find it too hot to walk around without shoes on.Dolphin Bay was fantastic, we went all out and booked a Royal Swim and we were not disappointed. We got up close & personal with the dolphins, had some fantastic photos and have some lovely memories. We were on our Honeymoon, and it was a really special thing to do. If we come back in a few years time with our young children, we would definitely take them to Dolphin Bay. In our group were 2 young children (aged approx 7 & 10) who did it alone whilst their parents watched, and they were in safe hands and really enjoyed themselves. The photos you can buy from Dolphin Bay are crazily expensive as with most of these places. A nice touch is that you get a complimentary towel & drink after your swim with the dolphins. We used this towel to dry off properly once we walked back to the changing rooms at the Waterpark (they are near the entrance, and it really is not that far. It is probably only a 5 min walk from most areas of the waterpark, probably about 10 min walk from Dolphin Bay.) We got back to the changing rooms about 4pm and it was quite busy! In the ladies changing room, women were glamming themselves up properly by washing & drying their hair and doing their makeup in the mirrors, which were a bit busy. I just got changed, brushed my hair and tied it up and decided to wash properly when I got back to the hotel to avoid the crowd of ladies around the mirrors and hair dryers (you pay for the hair dryers, by the way.) This was a wise move, as there was a queue for the taxis when we got to the entrance of the hotel! We waited about 15 minutes and we noticed there was a lack of normal taxis but lots of 'posher' hire cars (most of them either black or white.) We enquired, and ended up getting one of the un-marked posher taxis back, but we had to agree with the taxi driver that he would start the meter at the same price as a normal marked taxi, and so our drive back to our hotel in Dubai Creek cost the same in the posher car as it did in the marked taxi! (but make sure you check this before you get in!!!!)We stayed in Dubai Creek and including tip, it cost just 70 each way out to The Atlantis Hotel/waterpark (which is about \u00a312! Bargain!) The Journey takes about half an hour from Dubai Creek and probably about 20 minutes from the Dubai Mall area."

As a Dubai resident, we got cheaper prices so worth checking out. The rides are very good. The standard slide rides are better and faster than Wild Wadi, but there is only one 'thrill ride' ( the leap of faith) rather than the three at Wild Wadi. This is the one that hurtles you through the middle of a shark tank (although you go so fast you can't see anything). I think Aquaventure is probably the best choice for families and you can also go and see the Dolphins. One negative point it that the lockers are next to the entrance - a long way from the rest of the park so quite frustrating if you want to get anything from them! Overall though it's got to be one of the world's best waterparks."

There are lots of water attractions for all ages, flumes, lazy river, rapids etc and even though it was quite busy there were plenty of inflatables to use. Get there early to get a sunbed, although most of the time you just use it as a base to leave your towels. Have a stroll to view the dolphin enclosure and see the views of the Dubai skyline from the beach. Only negative for us was the queue at the end of the day to get a taxi."

However there where only 6 rides, 5 with a tube that where quite simular and one freefall without a tube. Except the freefall one could keep the glasses and hat on all the time without risk of loosing them - that tells a little about the \"wildness\" of the rides. There is also a rafting-river all round the compound (where the slides end up), unfortunately it is so slow water that one needs to jump out of the tube and swim / walk.The settings are really nice and it is themed very well, but the rides are not up to its promising. We went there with kids 7-12 years old, the 7 year thought everything was perfect, the other thougt it was OK but not thrilling. Compared to Wet\u00b4n Wild in Orlando the rides are really lame.The place is very well staffed with people about every 10th meter, also in the pools. There are a couple of snack-places, coffeshops etc inside, actually I think the prices are reasonalbe (compared to Disneyland etc). Towels & locker could be rented for a total of 50. Over 120 cm are classified as adult - entrance fee AED 200. However if you have opportunity for a Family Enterainer you can get three coupons \"buy one get one free\" saving lots of money!If you go there tip:1. Buy Entertainer Dubai to save money on entrance2. Be there when they open - then you can get \"reserve\" sunbed with you towels (free of charge) - after 12 it is often hard to find3. Go on the rides - was no lines before noon for us4. Take your car - they have not organized any transportation FROM the place. When they close (sunset) there is a 50 meter line for taxi. If you instead take the monorail there is note even a taxistand or anyway to get a ride from there. Someone have not been thinking or it is planned that everyone drive their own car?If you are short on time in Dubai, chose something else. I guess you could find a simular or better waterpark in any major vacation-area."

The queue's were small, but it still took approximately 15 minutes for us to gain entry into the park even though we had pre booked tickets. After this time the queue's became significantly bigger.The changing facilities were adequate, although one of our wristbands for the lockers did not work. However we did not have to queue up with the masses to sort this out, one of the staff organised a replacement wristband.Even though we arrived early, we could not find any available sunbeds which was slightly disappointing. We soon found out that to go on most of the rides/slides you were required to have a rubber ring, which at times were difficult to come by. Many people hung onto theirs. Singles and double rubber rings are provided along with life jackets for small children. There were lots of safety staff along the rapids which was nice to see.Queue's for some of the larger water slides were approximately 45 minutes long and over with very quickly. We felt that the waterpark was quite small in comparison to others we had visited.We also had to queue for about 20 minutes to order our food, even though it wasn't busy. The food was similar to McDonalds etc, we then had to wait another 25 minutes for the food to be ready which we felt was totally unacceptable. This is obviously a managerial problem which needs addressing.We went with our 5 and 8 yr old children and decided that we much preferred Dreamland which is located about a 50 minute drive north of Dubai. There is much more to do there, although maybe not as adrenalin filled. The queue's are much smaller, espescially if you go midweek.Waiting for a taxi afterwards to take us home from Atlantis took about 1 hour, which is not the hotels fault, but is worth noting."

I really do not need that wild wadi experience again. Aquaventure might get crowded on the weekends and public holidays as well, but it's only a bit annoying while you're standing in line to get on the slides. If you're just chilling in the water streams it's not to bad. The park is well maintained and very clean. There's such a huge amount of lifeguards, taht it makes me crack up every single time I go there. But anyway you'll enjoy your time. The leap of faith is great fun, but don't go to often. You'll see what I mean when you take a look at your shoulders after the second or third time. Slides in general are nice here. sometimes it takes a lot of patience though.Shark bites, the restaurant, is affordable when using the entertainer as well.

Great fun for adults and kids alike, although rather expensive to do.(Please see photo for rates as of December 2010).We went in December so the air was a bit chilly but the waters were fabulously warm and we were reluctant to get out into the cool air once in.Friendly and cheerful international staff at every corner and all round the vicinity , ever willing to give a helping hand made the visit all the more an enjoyable and safe experience .The park , like most of Dubai , was spotlessly clean and clear of any litter.Just as well, as once changed into our swimming costumes for the tube rides, we had to go around barefooted.Unless you have a waterproof bag of some sort, it was also impossible to carry any cash or valuables with you as they were bound to get wet. The lockers in the changing rooms were far away from any of the rides so it would have been impractical to go back and get any cash if one wanted to get a drink etc.It is also rather impossible to take any photos here unless armed with an underwater camera and you are advised to leave them in the lockers in the changing rooms if you do not want them to be damaged in any way.Due to the nature of the rides, they are not suitable for children less than 7 years old unless accompanied at all times by an adult. Although it was winter, the queues were quite long, the longest being the Leap of Faith, an almost vertical drop ride sans tube (this is the only ride in the park without a tube)- definitely not for the faint-hearted.We went after lunch and brought tid-bits and water along but the kids were so preoccupied with their rides that they did not stop to have anything to eat.There was also a man-made beach and bay which overlooked Burj Al Arab, supposedly the most luxurious hotel in the world.But the rides were sufficient for us and we did not go into the sea. We found a nice shady and uncrowded spot here on the grass and left our towels, food and water on a mat as we went to do the rides after which we returned to collect them before heading for the showers.It was quite a long wait in the changing rooms though for a shower, (about 20 mins) but the showers were warm and powerful.The bathrooms were generally well maintained and clean as well.Would definitely recommend this as a must-do but I would like to try the Wild Wadi the next time round to see how it compares to the Atlantis WaterPark. If you haven't been, it's worth going, even though it is a bit dear.But generally, it's a great outing for the family in Dubai.Tip- Try to get there early before lunch. We had to queue for about 3/4 hour at lunchtime to get in and the park closes at 5-6 pm (depending on the sunset time) so you would get your money's worth if you get there early.. We managed to squeeze in all the rides plus a few repeats but the kids would have liked to stay longer if given the time"

(Free as we were staying in the Atlantis hotel.) We rode the free golf buggy from the hotel to the far end of the water park where we always found plenty of comfy sunbeds. (Note great moveable sunshades which helped to keep us a little cooler.) We didn't go on any of the rides but spent hours on the 'lazy river' which isn't that lazy! The beach attached to the park was fun, but we saw a number of people being treated for jelly fish stings.Tip - Buy a refillible drinks bottle for 40 Dirham (\u00a38) then it is only 5 Dirham (\u00a31) to fill up. You can use it any day you visit, not just the day you buy it."

Dubai is such a crazy country I was not at all surprised to see that Atlantis had a water park attached to it - getting to Atlantis was a treat on its own - we got the Metro and then got a cab to the hotel and was met by a friendly doorman who opened the cab door and let us into the amazing complex.We were lucky to have the hindsite to buy the \"Entertainer\" book so we had 2 for 1 entry into Aquaventure - a relief as 200 dirhams per person is a heft amount to pay for a waterpark. But by saying that, what a water park! We were waiting in line to be served and immediately another desk opened up and we were ushered to it - the level of customer service was 5 star (like the hotel). Plenty of changing facilities and room to wander about if you're tired from racing about the slides as well. You can hire towels too.The \"Leap of Faith\" was the first slide I did and it was awesome. Very very fast and one hell of the drop. I did it 4 times and I am scared of heights! The other slides were very good and you can do them all with a tube. Once you finish the other slides you're ou're led onto the lazy rivers and this is amazing. You can go down rapids or go down one with constant waves and they go on and on and on! Once you eventually end you can keep on going down the rivers or go to shore and sit back in the sun. It's no fuss and incredibly well run with plenty of lifeguards watching everybody at all times.The only low point which isn't too bad but does need improvement was the concession carts for water, soft drink etc - paying 16 dirhams for water was a little cheeky! But I guess you are at Atlantis which is a completely different world than anything else. I highly recommend this attraction, especially if you have a copy of the Entertainer as then it's a real bargain. But either way this is a must see/do when visiting Dubai."

The beach was rubbish, yes it had white sand and warm water, but it was so still may be a little stagnent. All in all i must say i was LET DOWN BIG TIME.

The cost of food and drink were high but no worse than the usual Dubai prices. The only potential problem is in the walk from the lockers to the action areas which becomes very hot and people were burning the soles of their feet. You can buy flip flops there but you will pay a premium so it is worthwhile taking something with you. Recommended activity."

The park itself is one of the larger water parks I've been to, but you would think the size would lend itself to a varied amount of slides\\rides. You'd be wrong, all the slides are in the ziggeraut near the back of the park and most of them are similar. Having said that, we really enjoyed the rapids and the leap of faith is one of the best slides I've been on, you can keep your eyes open for the most part, which I find is rare on most steep slides these days :D The other slides are all up\\down tube affairs, you can stay in your tube for about 20 mins if you like as they have a conveyor system, but its kind of boring after the first go.The water in the park isn't as cold as it should be imo and as a previous poster said, there are plenty of exposed places to burn your feet.We visited Wild Wadi the day before and in my opinion, thats a better park. Not as big, but more varied rides. Good to do both, but if your only doing one goto wild wadi ;)"

There was extreme hype on the shark ride in which you are in a glass tunnel and surrounded by sharks. The ride may have been hard to build, but ; frankly I could see only 1 small shark! there were more of fishes. Some rides were awesome while otheres were a bit slow.

We were advised to arrive 15 mins early which we were glad we did. As soon as we arrived in Dolpin Bay, everyone greeted us very warmly - so friendly and helpful. Checking in was very easy and soon we were told on what we should and shouldn't do, e.g. take out all jewellery, etc. Then we were given the option of having to change to a wet suit or a jacket. After all that, we had to go through an orientation to learn more about the dolpins which lasted about 10 to 15 mins. I must say that we did learn a thing or two about the dolpins so we didn't mind. The children there seemed to enjoy it. After that, the fun part starts! When we met our dolpin Alice, she was such a wonderful gentle creature! We got to touch her, kiss her, play or dance with her and pose with her. Everyone had their turn and it was such a wonderful experience. There were 10 people per group and the time spent with the dolpins was half an hour. The trainers were really great and they made sure that all of us took part properly and asked us if we had any questions for them, which they happily answered. You could tell that they really love the dolpins, so it's nice to know that they are well taken care of. After it was all over, we could have a shower and change. Water and soft drinks were provided. Then it was time to look at the photos. They are expensive to buy but we could not resist taking back some good memories with us. Besides, it's a good way to help fund the upkeep of the dolpins so we didn't mind so much. All in all, it was a once in a lifetime experience that everyone should do at least once. Highly recommended!!"

            "review": "Good day out, but plenty of annoyances along the way.. I went to Atlantis waterpark over the Eid holiday, which is the few days holiday at the end of Ramadan. Since it was a holiday time, it was totally PACKED with a combination of Gulf Arabs on vacation and US military personnel on R & R. This was, as you can imagine, a very curious mix of conservative and non-conservative. Despite arriving as soon as the park opened, the queues were long. We opted to pay for a towel rental and a locker and got our required entry wristband. However, no-one, at any time, informed us that we could load money on this wristband to pay for goods on the other side, so this was our first encounter with the poor communication at the park.  Once inside the locker rooms, it was unclear how the lockers worked. There was a diagram on each door, which was incomprehensible. We had to wait and ask the attendant how to work the locker and it turned out the lock was operated by your wristband and the attendant showed us the trick. Easy when you know how, but a challenge on your own. We witnessed many other people having difficulties with the lock and then having to ask the attendant. Black mark number two.Once undressed and clutching our (paper) towel coupon, we wondered should we get the towel at the start of the adventure, or at the end, and if we get it at the end, what should we do with our coupon in the meantime. The towel cabanas were nowhere to be seen, so we decided to leave our precious towel coupons in the locker.We set off to find the start of the park. The first attraction we came too involved climbing a lot of stairs. We noticed that everybody climbing the stairs had an inflatable ring with them to use, so we wondered where to get the rings from. After much searching of the nearby signs, we finally had to ask and were shown to a completely different area where the rings were kept in a back area, all piled up. No sign to say that these rings were a critical part of the water-riding experience and needed to be collected first before you could do anything else. So a lot of time wasted there - black mark number 3.Once we had a ring each, we were able to get going. Despite the park being busy, at that time in the morning the queues moved quickly and it was easy to get on lots of things. As the day progressed, though, the queues lengthened and we chose the rafting experience, which runs in a continual loop and is a lot of fun. There are many, many lifeguards along the way, which was comforting, especially since I fell out of my ring during one set of rapids and quickly started to panic. The lifeguard lifted me up right away and advised me what to do should it happen again. I was very impressed with his speed, so that was a plus.When it came to lunch, since all of our belongings were back at the lockers, one of us had to laboriously go back there and get some money. If anybody had told us about the loading money on the wristband thing (which we only found out at the end of the day), we could've saved a lot of time and energy.Black mark number 4 came at the end of the day when we needed to get our towels. We had to go all the way back to the lockers to get the towel coupons and then head out again to find the towel cabanas, which all seemed to be back in the park. So more confusion and head-scratching and searching for signposts. Why isn't there a towel cabana beside the lockers? If there is, it wasn't obvious. Next time, we will probably bring our own towels.Overall, though, I have to say that it was an excellent day out and although we stayed for about five hours, we still didn't manage to do everything, so a return trip is in order. Next time we will be prepared though!"

I wasn't always sure that our small children would be safe on it even though we were constantly reassured by the lifeguards. Also, they are very strict about the prohibition on outside food and drinks, and it is ridiculous that you have to pay extra for a locker.So don't go to Atlantis because it's cheap. Go for the exotic location and thrilling rides. If you want somewhere gentler for the kids, with more attractions geared toward them, try Dreamland Aqua Park in Omm al-Qawain."

We were initially impressed by Aquaadventure it was clean and there was fun to be had on the rapids/torrents/slides. But that was it, the fun was over after 2/3 hours and it was just boring. 13dhms for water was a bit much. We went to Wild Wadi the next day and the next and again on our last day. It is infinitely better than Aquaadventure."

We stayed one night in Atlantis Hotel so we could use the aquapark.The aquaventure is beautiful, you can borrow a life jacket for toddlers , so is fantastic for those who can't swim. My daughter loved the kids corner ,all the slides were fantastic.They don't allow adults in most of the kids slides ( even the big slides) but because they thought I was her sister they let me in(!) The adults slides usually have a long queue, so we didn't use because was too hot to stay in the queue. There are photographers taking photos of you everywhere around the park so you can buy the photos after ( cost around \u00a315 each) You can bring you drinks and snacks inside (I forgot to bring and ended up paying \u00a35 for a bottle of 500ml water and \u00a37 for a can of pepsi) Overall the place is excellent, there are staff everywhere so you can feel safe if you have young kids.If you plan just to use the aquapark, is best to book one night in the Atlantis so you can use the aquaventure, the lost chambers, the pool and beach for two days ( the day you check in and the day you check out also )"

Ive visited Dubai many times and this was my families second visit to the Atlantis. I always remembered it being a little expensive but I guess I accepted that given the facilities and the grandure of the hotel. However this time round the costs and relentless approach from the staff for cash was just too much for me to handle. 50DHS for a pint of beer, thats \u00a38.30 GBP, is ridiculous. We have for a few years chosen Dubai as a good alternative to European and US holidays and it always came out on top, however its clear to see now that this destination is suffering from the package holiday influx and Dubai is cashing in on it.We treated our kids to the Dolphin experience whilst at the hotel, which for the five of us worked out to just under \u00a3600 GBP. Ok a little heavy but I thought the experience would be a good one. The actual Dolphin swim was so scripted it was sickening. All I can say about this is, its just not worth the money. Oh and I should mention the costs of the photographs....... budget for at least \u00a3100 GBP.To sum up the Atlantis offers a very unique Duabi experience, is it value for money, in a word no. I would suggest staying at one of the Jumeriah hotels i.e the Mina A Salam, worth every penny!"

Undoubtely the main attraction of the park is the Ziggurat and its slides, that you must climb with your own tube and then you can choose among different types of rides. The most spectacular is the no-tube slide which is a terrific sliding-fall down which starts from the very top of the Ziggurat and ends at its basis. But there are other rides of different adrenalinic level. One of them passes through an aquarium tunnel so that you seem to ride among the sharks and other fish.If you don't have enough you can try the other rides along the park, but if you don't like adrenalin and you are tired you can let yourself be transported by the lazy current of the river which flows very slowly throughout the park, over and over. For young children there is a dedicated themed area with many slides for all ages. The park is supervised at all times by an incredible number of lifeguards.If you stay at the hotel Atlantis the Palm the entry is free."

The water rides are fab, you dont even have to leave your rubber ring for some rides, you go up your little conveyor belt in your rubber ring, it's great! You can also take a wander o to the beach and go in the sea which I didnt realise you could do, we loved it! Yes I guess it was expensive but when you're on holiday in Dubai you must expect these amazing places not to be dirt cheap?! And yes it got fairly busy in the afternoon, but when do you ever go to a water park and not queue a little bit? I've been to the Disney water parks and think that aqua venture is just as good a day out.

One ride which we enjoyed, iss when you came out in a glass shoot, going very slowly in a tank full of different fishes. The only thing that ruined it was the wether as it got too hot to walk around.

Best feature was 99% of rides were accessed from the lazy river so you never had to get out of the water. Tubes were too small for adults and riding them up escalators was an stamina exercise for your neck. I agree with several other writers that the lifeguards were gruff and unfriendly. Usually a sign of how they are treated as employees or at least managed. In an area know for extreme summer heat, I was surprised they don't have misters for the sidewalks to minimize the burning flesh when you need to walk about. US parks have been doing this for years. and its not like they don't already have drip lines anywhere there is a living plant to keep them alive.Another poorly planned item is lockers. Lockers are located only at the main gate which is a very long way from anything other than the front gate. Anything I was willing to keep in a locker I could have not brought at all, because it wasn't worth going all the way back to it.All in all we did have an enjoyable day, but with a facility as over the top as Atlantis I was expecting more. ***Sidebar*** On your way out be sure to find the Cold Stone creamery Ice cream shop just inside the hotel. Unlike the water park, the staff in there was incredibly entertaining and talented. They literally throw ice cream to one another like snowballs. A show well worth seeing and the ice cream was excellent."

As a hotel guest, up four people can enjoy the waterpark and aquarium for free. The hotel lets you check in as early as you like, and will still give you credentials even if you arrive in the morning, so that means that for the price of ojne night at the fabulous resort, you can enjoy two full days of the waterpark. The park is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The water attractions are good, but waterpartk experts will tell you that the they could have more thrill slides. The Shark Attack is very nice because you get to spend a couple of minutes in a tube that is surrounded by sharks and other swimming creatures.The staff are very friendly and professional. Many of the life guards made it a point to get to know my son and nephew by name so they could say hi every time they went by. At one point, my nephew felt lost and was located by hotel security staff who stayed took him back to our park home base, stayed with him and made sure that he was comfortable by giving him water and some flip-flops. To sum up the staff, if they are not truly happy to have you as a guest, they do a great job of faking it."

No part of the ride was beyond our years, although we are fairly young at heart. There are a few other rides that we did not use that looked to be more like \"white knuckle rides\" for the more adventurous. There was also a great area for younger children and families.I have not got a good figure and being in a swimming costume only is not good for me, but I love the Arabic fashion for wearing a swimdress in the pool, so much more comfortable and flattering. I bought the overdress from downtown Dubai's BHS - yes, they have most of the stores from the UK's high street.The main downside for me was the state of the changing rooms/showers.

A golf cart takes you from the hotel to inside the water park without you having to queue for tickets.Although it is big and it was fun, we felt that the lifeguards were not as friendly (interested) as the ones at Wild Wadi (another water park in Dubai). In fact, majority of the life guards were grumpy and dis interested. Saying that, they did the job and it did not affect our time at Aquaaventure.We ate everyday at Shark Bites. A mean deal (e.g. burger, chips and a drink) is approx \u00a310. When we were there, the hotel (Atlantis) gave us vouchers so the kids ate free. Otherwise, it is approx \u00a340 for the 4 of us for lunch. The food was nice and the air condition was great. It is a great place to take a break from the heat outside.Being a big water park, you do have to walk. Although not far, the floor is very hot. At wild wadi, the life guards and the sprinkler kept the paths wet so that it is not that hot on your feet. Althought they have sprinkler system at Aquaventure, it seems to be far fewer. You do need to have something on your foot.Drinks are quite expensive. Just over \u00a35 for a mile shake. Approx \u00a34 for a fizzy drink. \u00a3 for pop corn. You should take some water with you, especially if you are visiting in the summer.The water rides are fun.If you stay at the hotel, you can charge everything to your room so you do not have to take any cash around with you.We felt quite safe in the water park. You can leave things in the bag on the chair and have confidence that it will not disappear. Many people had SLRs, so they must have left them somewhere.We did not have to wait long for the rides. We found that 3 hours at a time is plenty sufficient. Then it is time to return to the hotel pool and relax.If you go to Dubai, you must visit Aquaventure."

Look for a Sun lounger, place your clothes and towels on it and there u go...be there early to avoid the crowds. Lines formed after midday and u could hardly find a tube for the rides since then.The weather was so hot (we vusited in july) that any chilled drink became lukewarm in minutes...so even u brought with u the water, u still wanted to buy some real icy ones at the kiosks. Costly though at 18 dirhams per bottle or u may choose to buy a refill cup at 40 dirhams so that u may get a refill of soft drinks at 5 dirhams each time.My 8 years old son is a lover for exciting games and he went for the leap of faith 3 times. According to him, it was the best slide in the park. The line for this slide might be goung slow as there were people who hesitated to go down and stuck there. It took time for one trying to overcome the fear and to chicken out, to try again and decide to leave... 5 mins had passed!!!!On thurday summer nights, a carnival will be held and the park will open till midnight with fireworks and lazaer show to conclude. ask the hotel beforehand to get the most of the arrangement. I didn't get chance to experience the fun but got a glimpse of it out from the balcony while the Kids were fast asleep.My 60+ mom who doesnt know how to swim had a great time floating along the river with rapids but certainly not good for small kids who are scared of water, as parents are not allowed to hold them when going through the rapids for safety sake.Highly recommend it if u stay at the hotel... If u need to pay a steep price for entry, think twice ESP if u have been to some brilliant water parks before."

Out of the 3 located in Dubai it's hard to pick the best, since haven't visit the others, but this one claimed to have the \"speed-monster\" of the waterslides - one of the fastest on the planet which takes you down from the pyramid look-like hill top with top speed of 80 km/h!Only for the waterenthusiats, since the activity is solely based on the water theme. But if you're thinking would you dare to go there and you're already interested in water - take the step, since there is something for every level and age.Yet it's hard to get there by the monorail, you should try it, since it's something totally different what you're used to - an exiting choice which is not that popular that you should be wiaiting in long lines."

Great location, great facilities, great rides/slides.They have thought of everything - from lockers, towels, cash on wristbands, sun loungers with canopies, good food outlets, great layout and family friendly! Virtually all the rides can be enjoyed on solo or double inflateable rings, and the rapids and lazy river are the perfect way to keep cool in the Dubai heat.The Palm monorail takes you directly to the park door, or park at the designated car park and get the free shuttle bus to the entrance - much more fun using the monorail though, and great views of the Palm and Atlantis hotel as you arrive.Only negative comment I would make is the beach area is not that nice - typical man made area, but stay in the water park area and enjoy every minute."

The rides were nice but not too exciting. The usual rides which any water park has, except for one ride which was a real thrill called \"The Leap of Faith\". This ride was exciting giving an adrenaline rush.The safety aspect was very well covered. They had lifeguards at very small intervals which brought about a sense of safety, especially for kids. The rapids were nice but because of safety aspect they were not too fast and thrilling. If you have been to some nice water park, you can give this a miss, because it does not have much different to offer. I would not go there again."

There is no point to charge reduced prices to attract more visitors, but then you start charging supplements for additional services, such as locker, parking and very expensive food and drinks. These are services that you need to take and therefore you do not have choice.The weather was nice and for an outdoor experience with the family was fine, however it is not the watermark that will leave you with the desire to be back. Most water slides are concentrated in the same location and the signage is very poor. You waste your time understanding where everything is and what it is.There are much better water parks."

We laughed all day and had an absolute ball, I would most definitely recommend this water park and would certainly return if I go back to Dubai. Queues could be quite lengthy at times so go as early as you can to make the most of your day.

The long circular \"river rides\" with rapids in the park were very good and quite long and they kept us amused for a long time. They had also built a pyramid in the centre of the park, the top of which was the starting point for a couple of water rides/slides. However, these rides/slides were a disappointment: the lines for those rides/slides were close to 30/45 minutes (due in part to the fact that it was possible to cut in line at a few places) and these rides/slides lasted a mere 20 seconds. Unlike rollercoasters, water slides have to rely on gravity only and a 15 meter vertical drop simply does not result in a long ride. Overall, we had a good day out, but we considered it rather expensive for what it was (Adult AED 200/USD54; child under 1.2 meter AED 165/USD44) and they charge extra for towels (AED 40/USD 11 each) and a locker (AED 30/USD 8). Once you also include meals, a family day here is rather expensive and we have been to other waterparks that offer similar attractions at a lower price.Michael, London"

Went there on a friday, big mistake, plenty of rude local youth who cut lines, scream and don't follow the instructions of the supervisors, who are simply overwhelmed. long lines in front of each ride, rides are short and the Leap of Faith main attraction doesn't come close to similar attractions in other water parks. Going through the shark tank is an useless experience as you don't realise that you are going through anything at all. The Shark attack ride, which leads you through the same tank, allows you to see more fish, but hardly any sharks.I wouldn't recommend spending all that money for so little."

Certainly not worth the money.On a more concerning note I seriously question the staff training and health and safety at this venue. In particular whilst on a shoot that goes uphill the rubber ring did not make it up a steep incline thus throwing us back down. Expecting a lifeguard to come to get us as we were being battered by water jets and now stuck in the middle of the shoot but no one appeared until we eventually had to shout and scream until rescued! Over 5 mins stuck! They apparently could not see us - that is the most worrying part. Overall a lovely place to visit to look at however a very frightening experience and not one I will revisit!"

The grumpy member of staff told us to go the bay area to get one. On arriving at the bay area there were no tubes in sight. On asking the grumpy lifeguard he told us to stand and wait for an empty one to come round or to wait for someone to get off. After standing for approx 15mins we decided to give up and went looking around the park. Eventually an hr after reaching the waterpark we found 2 rings and managed to get on some rides. All the staff we came across were grumpy, barely able to raise a smile and uncommunicative. We went to Wild Wadi a few days later and the difference in the attiutde of the staff was amazing - their staff are smiley, friendly and game for a laugh, they want to talk to you and ask if youre having a good time. The park feels better organised and is far cheaper. Overall give Atlantis a miss and go to Wild Wadi instead."

We bought a combo ticket with access to Aquaventure and The lost chambers for 250 AED, which is a saving of 25 AED if you bought the tickets individually.Started our visit by going to the lost chambers, a huge Aquarium which claims to host 65000 types of marine animals. As with the name, Lost Chambers as well as the water park is modelled on in the legendary lost city of Atlantis. The giant aquarium is a big hit and gives an opportunity to observe the marine species closely.Following the visit to lost chambers, we collected our entry tickets (read plastic watches) and entered the Aquaventure water park. There are changing rooms with secure lockers conveniently located just after the entrance. Lockers can be hired for 40 AED and in case you forgot to get your towel, you can hire both the locker and the towel for 50 AED. However, I do recommend that this is a water park and you have to be aptly dressed in swimwear to enjoy the park fully.After changing to the swim wear, we started with the river rides by grabbing the tubes and floating around the 2 km long river which is interspersed with rapids and torrents in many places. 2 km on the tube can be daunting, but it does kick up the excitement and set you up for the bigger rides.The water slides are definitely the bigger attraction and all of it based on the central part of the park called the Ziggurat.The highlight of the Zigurrat is the leap of faith ride, a 70 degree vertical plunge, which takes you through the shark and sting ray enclosure and certainly kicks up enough adrenaline. There are many other adventurous slides, but this one is exciting.I have heard of the WIld Wadi park close to Burj Al Arab, but didn't go there as we had already planned Atlantis, so can't comment on it, But I do feel Atlantis Water Park is a must visit when you are in Dubai."

We didn't eat or drink there, so I can say much about the costs.The website boasts about a 42 acre waterpark, well this includes everything!! There really aren't that many slides, as a max I would say there are about 10 different slides, and that includes the slides taking you back up to the top.The queues can be really annoying. Standing on top of a man made pyramid waiting 30 minutes for a slide with a cold breeze freezing you, with little kids pushing in - not great! The slide with the longest queue is the one with the tunnel that goes through the fish tank, where you can apparently see sharks and loads of fantastic fish. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying it's rubbish, but it's completely overrated! You get quickly pushed through the 'fish tank' and that's it, ride over!I remember going to the Wild Wadi as a child, and I'm sure it was much better. But compared to water parks in America, this is nothing.If you have a free day in Dubai, with nothing else to do, and it's extremely hot, then go. Otherwise spend your money on something better! There are so many other things to do in Dubai and this isn't one of the greatest."

The lockers were very clean and tidy, plentiful changing areas upon arrival but got very busy as everyone was leaving. We had our pick of sunbeds and chose ones by the lagoon area, adjacent to the Kids play area. The park was spotlessly clean, attendants at every turn, lifeguards all around the rapids, lagoon areas etc, many inflatables for the various rides about too. We thoroughly enjoyed the day there, as it was December, the weather started to cool and shade drew in around 3:45 or so, however we walked round to the beach area and enjoyed some more sun. The whole place was was relaxing and easy, music piped in the back ground and a general laid back feeling enhanced the visit.We had lunch at Shark Bites, its a fast food, but cooked to order place, it was much better quality than I anticipated, the prices were high for fast food, however we were using our BOGOF entertainer voucher again so it worked out very reasonable, the portions were rather large and despite being a fast food outlet the service was impeccable. I needed a fork and returned inside to get one and a member of staff ushered me back to my table and insisted on getting it for me. The service here is fantastic. There are golf buggys transporting guests around the park and up to the Dolphin experience, on to the beach and back around to the hotel.Our kids enjoyed an ice cream sundae and candy floss on the way out, again they Sundae was about \u00a36 but I didnt feel ripped off, the quality was there and having used our entertainer vouchers.

Great fun for young and old.The water park itself tries to be very Disney, but doesn\u2019t quite pull it of. Firstly, get there early. There aren\u2019t enough sun beds when the park is busy, so you will then end up walking around trying in vain to find one. You will eventually give up and have to pay \u00a38 for a locker. If you do get a sun lounger, each has an individual shade which can be adjusted to suit your needs and there quite comfy as well. Also if you don\u2019t bring a towel there \u00a36. The best part is the dolphin experience. The experience is great and you know that the dolphins are well looked after and their personalities taken into consideration during their training. Within your entry fee is a locker, soft drinks and a towel. The electronic locker key is a great idea but not transferable to the water park.Most of the rides start from the Ziggurat and in the afternoon the queues become quite large. There is also a lazy river which can take various routes, lazy or rapids. All the rides use these big rubber rings. This is fine in the morning, but once it get busy people start to keep hold of them and you will in up waiting to find one.The main attraction is the LEAP OF FAITH. It\u2019s a sheer drop and to be honest I screamed like a girl the first time. I wouldn\u2019t advise going on to often because I got quite a bruised behind. :o) Safety is in the form of life guides on every corner, who are constantly blowing there whistles at the misbehaving people.The food is very reasonably priced within the water park and the service is quick at each of the service areas."

They didn't tell me that, but a nice person did allow us to order anyway and come by later on when I did manage to go all the way back to the entrance.Also be aware, that lockers are REALLY SMALL, one backpack per locker!"

For younger children, there is a very limited set of things to do. If you are less than 1.2m, then all the really good rides are out of bounds and this was very disappointing. The rapids were great and the water play area. We did a dolphin encouter which was fantastic, but the briefing took forever and I was glad I did not put my four year old through this, was fine for the six year old. Limited food choices, but reasonable value."

Don't imagine that half a day will be enough thoufgh, there's lots to do.We also booked a Dolphin adventure, which despite involving dolphins in captivity, which I was a bit sceptical about, was actually an amazing experience. Not a cheap addition to an already fairly pricey day out, but one of those \"always to be remembered' experiences.My big tip if you go this park is to try to book a \"Cabana\" for the day. This gives you a roped off private space with a gazebo style tent for shade with a table and chairs where you can eat lunch, private sun beds, etc. There's also an attendant who keeps an eye on everything and will go get lunch and drinks for you, and there's a locker to keep eveything safe while you're off around the park. Also they give you a lovely bowl of fruit, chilled soft drinks and free towels. No worries about losing your sun bed or personal belongings, plus at busy time it guarantees a quiet area with some personal space (sunbeds elsewheer are really crammed together, and there's little shade). It would be ideal for a family, there are cabanas for four or eight people. You need to pre-book since they get snaped up quickly on the day. They add a bit t your bill for the day, but are probably the best value thing about the whole place.Wonderful day out all round though. Not cheap by any stretch, but worth it as a holiday treat for everyone.Peter H"

It's also set out in such a way that you can set up a base and manage to see everything without dragging all of your things all over the park.Do not bother with the \"beach\" the water is stagnant and the beach itself is unwelcoming and very boring - not a wave in sight.If you come here and I think you should, prepare to spend a lot of money in addition to your entrance. Towels are $10 and when you soak one through you can't replace it you have to pay another $10! A burger combo is $14 and more if you want your fries curly! A bottle of water is $3 and a beer is $7. Also if you don't keep the receipts to prove that you have spent $30 on food and beverages, you will have to pay $7 for parking your car and where does one put a receipt in a bikini?This place is really banking on the fact that people will not drag their children, who will be having a whale of a time, out of a theme park on a matter of principle and of course they are right. Do not bother asking the staff anything as they are pre programmed robots, the only programming they have received, however is how to be totally unhelpful and adhere to company policies even in circumstances whereby the company is lacking product etc.Go to Aquaventure you will have a good time, your kids will adore it and talk about it for years, we had two 6 year olds, a 10 year old and a 15 month old with us and they all got a huge amount out of it. By the way, as our family is particularly tall, we all were charged as adults as the lower 'Kids\" price is based on height not age!!! They clearly know that lots of Danes like to go there!So, go. Go to Aquaventure. Go with a full tummy! Keep your receipts and enjoy a burger that is priced as in a five star golf club, but eaten in a staff canteen."

There are some amazing views of Dubai (from the top of the area you need to climb for the more thrilling rides) and you can also see the Burj Al Arab form here, so good photo opportunities.

The attractions are crowded, lines are long, there is a lot of pushing and shoving, and it's standing room only. We had left the towels we rented for 150 AED on a chair and were lucky to locate 3 of the 4 cast to the side, wet after someone else had used them. No chance of lunch as there was no place to sit, so we cut our day short.I was quite disappointed that there are no drinking fountains and there aren't enough sun beds to accomodate the afternoon crowds.

The Lost Chambers was fun and the artificial artifacts were neat. The Leopard Eels were really cool. There are tons of photo-ops along the way and the gift shop at the end isn't too bad as far as prices go. After the Lost Chambers (which is a pretty quick look-around) we went to the waterpark. The lockers cost 40AED (11.00USD) and if you need a towel it is 10dirhams (3.00USD) more; we didn't bring or buy towels. Our first stop was the locker room, it's not co-ed so I was the only one w/access to it. They give you a wrist band that has a magnetic circle in it that will assign you the first locker you put it up to. Once we got settled in and our SPF on we went to find some food first. It wasn't easy because some places weren't open or didn't have what they advertised to have i.e. the popcorn stand without popcorn(?). We just ended up grabbing some snacks from a cart that drives around and parks. It's pretty pricey, wish we'd eaten beforehand. It was pretty quiet I thought, we went on a Thursday and their busy days are Friday's and Saturdays I believe. The lounge chairs were awesome because they are made of a comfortable mesh and have a top that swings over giving even more shade. Water tubes weren't too hard to come by but again it was slower on the day we went. Their version of the Lazy River (I can't remember what it's called) where you float around in a circle, was really neat because there were rides in between so it was surprising. That was my favorite part. We went on some other rides but the big ones (by the time we got the nerve up:)) were closed. I guess the big rides close around 6:00pm. I was a little dissapointed by that. I thought most waterparks stayed open later. It does get dark pretty early in Dubai though so that may be why. I would've spent more time playing than sunning if I'd realized that, I should have informed myself better. Otherwise this was a blast. It can take a good part of a day if you spread out your activities as it is a smaller water park and the attractions are few compared to other parks of it's kind but the Lost Chambers is a fun prelude to it all. Definitely recomend it but be aware of the admission price so you aren't surprised."

There were a few kids who were upset as most of the rapids etc had a height restriction of 1.2m which was strictly enforced so they could not go on them even if they were good swimmers. Lifeguards were very friendly and professional. Dolphin shows and experience were all extra to the price also.

The other major attraction is that Aquaventure has it's own beach! Gorgeous when you want a break from the water.The slides and rapids are great fun. My personal favourite is The Torrent. I haven't done the Leap of Faith because I'm too chicken but the other slides are great and I love the fact that for most of them you don't ever have to leave your ring.Food and drink prices are in line with what you'd expect in a relatively exclusive water park attached to an iconic 5* hotel.

Had one night at the 895++ rate (1074) for 2 adults and 2 kids (6&4). Although the rooms are not available until 2pm, you can check in early, access Aquaventure from 10am and leave your luggage with reception. Despite plans to get there as it opened, it was like herding ferrets round the apartment, so we arrived about 12pm. Check-in was quick and efficient. It was boiling when we arrived and we trailed around looking for a sun-lounger (kids moaning), but there were lots around the back near Barracuda restaurant. Our sons are below the 120cm height restriction, so we were limited to the kids Splash area (lots of smallish, but still good fun for them, slides and water sprays), the wave pool (pretty sedate) and the Torrent (lazy river), which included a rapids section you could could choose to go on or not. We stayed 6 hours until the kids' splash bit was evacuated due to some child pooing in it, but we were ready to leave anyway. The sunloungers have individual shades over them , but it is still hot sitting under them. It is cool enough if you sit in the splash pool, but lots of people roasted a lovely shade of red, so do cover up. I would also recommend pool shoes, as I had to get off the lazy river before completing the route and burnt my feet getting back tomy shoes.The kids had a fab time. My husband and I both got very cross with people hoarding the rings that you needed to go round the lazy river - many (all nationalities) had several by their loungers, in the restaurants or on the rocks in the splash area and refused to give them up, so we spent 20 minutes asking people who came off the river for theirs, with most refusing because they were still using them (ie wanted to ride again before they left). There were enough rings for all the people who wanted them at any one time if people didn't hoard them. The staff asked people to give them up, but didn't make them do so and I have to say that it did spoil the day a bit.You can take a litre of water per person in (didn't know this). 600ml bottles are 10dhs each, bottles of coke 12dhs. We had lunch in Barracudas - cool, quiet, good quality food and plenty of it. The kids had burger/ chicken strips, chips and Capri-sun (35dhs each) and I had half a chicken tikka, nan, raita and some grated veg (delicious) and 58dhs.For dinner, we had planned to get room service, but main courses were around 140-180dhs, so we went to Kaleidoscope restaurant and had the buffet (175 per adult, 85 per child aged 3-12). The problem is that we are spoiled with access to great food over here and I was expecting lots from this. It was good (Italian, Chinese, Indian, carvery, Arabic, sushi and lots of desserts )but nothing special, in my opinion, and I thought it was overpriced, particularly when the kids were too tired to eat much at all. There wer lots of high chairs and booster seats, free baby food and it was easy to be there with children. Breakfast was 140/ 70 dhs each and we chose not to eat there.Our deluxe room had a sea view and was very nice.The children would have liked to go back to Aquaventure on the second day and you can, at no extra cost, but we had an appointment elsewhere and my husband had had enough anyway.Altogether, Aquaventure, lunch, dinner the room and valet parking cost 2000 dhs. We had a good time and I'm glad that we tried it, as it is one of Dubai's attractions, but we won't go again.Hope this is helpful."

Our children (aged 7 and 9) love water parks, especially during the hot Dubai heat.We do find this waterpark quite busy (worse in school holidays) and so involves long queues at the entrance, problems getting the rubber rings (so much so that people hoard) and finding sunbeds seated together. It means that you do have to set off early and reserve your place sadly. Bring your own towels and charge your wrist bands at the entrance so that you don't have to bring money and valuables into the park (or get a locker at extra cost). Food and drink (the usual theme park food, ice cream, half of a pineapple & watermelon) are readily available and the usual cost. There are no water drinking fountains that we could find!There are many rides but a little more suitable to the larger and taller child. Our 9 year old was tall enough to go on the Ziggarat but was a bit 'light' and so once he was in a ring he wasn't heavy enough to get pushed up on the travelator and so the ride had to be stopped. The 7 year old was too short for these rides.It is a good family day out and a must in Dubai but beware the long queues and the cost."

I do have a suggestion for the shower area....would be very handy to have a hook to hang towel.I would also definitely suggest taking your own water and plenty of it as its very expensive.Overall I am very pleased I went and enjoyed my day.

As a hotel guest you receive a bracelet on the way to the park each day. The only extra we paid for was for a locker, which are approximately \u00a38 a day. All towels are free to hotel guests aswell. The lazy river is brilliant, you can just relax in your rubber ring an float around for hours, and take different short cuts to different rides, such as the rapids and torrent, all were brilliant. The slides were great especially the \u201cShark Attack\u201d where you go through the tunnel through the tank full of sharks, rays and different fish. My sister did the \u201cleap of faith\u201d she said it was brilliant but looked a bit to scary for me!!!. Food and drink is expensive in the park, but no more expensive than when you go to Chessington etc in this country.A must do when visiting Dubai.. Loads of fun."

When you get there, you'll find that EVERYTHING is very expensive. By accident, we arrived early which turned out to be the ideal time to avoid long lines for the water slides. Because everything is so spread out, you really have to plan your day in order to get to do all of the rides. Staying there at the resort could be fun, but we couldn't justify the 600/night room. I would say that the aquarium there is quite spectacular if you enjoy looking at fish. That's probably the best feature of the place. The water features are fun, but again, just not worth the wait and money. Also, beaches 'close' at dusk, so good luck sitting and watching the sunset!"

You can buy this book online or we found it at Borders Bookshop in the Emirates Mall. You have to pay to rent towels if you do not bring your own (about \u00a36 per towel). However, there is no deposit scheme, so you can walk away with same towels if you choose - and they are huge beach towels. Nobody checks your belongings if you want to take your own food and drinks so you can save money there too if you want. Get there when the place opens and take your belongings with you to stake out your sunloungers. We had absolutely no problems with getting loungers, rubber rings or queues for rides. This is not the place for adrenaline junkies (bar the Leap of Faith) but is more a relaxed fun park involving a very long and complicated Lazy River which has torrent and rapid options - you choose. It is completely surrounded by well maintained gardens and don't forget the lovely white sand beaches. You can also pay to feed the rays (or just watch) or pay to \"interact\" with the dolphons (or, again, just watch). In Discovery Cove in Florida, you cannot just watch - you have to pay to participate as it all takes place out of sight. Not here! Large numbers of very happy lifeguards at every twist and turn of the river, photo opportunities with no pressure AT ALL to buy - you choose to view the photos AFTER you leave the park in the souvenirs shop. Again, unlike Disney. You can visit the hotel to gawp at the ocean-themed decor and watch the beautiful tropical fish in the enormous tank all for free. Unlike the Burj Al Arab where you have to have a restaurant reservation to get in at all. It is also a stop on the open top bus tour and has its own monorail stop so transport is very easy. Don't forget, this is a business they are running so they make money where they can. You have choices too so make best use of them. We did not visit Wild Wadi (much to our teenage children's disgust) so cannot compare but will go there next time. And use our discount vouchers there too, of course!"

Well, actually no - or at least not amazing enough I'm sorry to say.Elsewhere on Tripadvisor you'll find visitors to Dubai sharing mixed views on the two main water parks - Wild Wadi at Jumeirah Beach and this one next to the Atlantis Hotel on the Palm. Of course it's a matter of opinion but I felt that the choice of rides/attractions you get with the basic entrance charge (\u00a336 at Feb exchange rates) felt somewhat limited. Centred around the Ziggurat water slides, the flumes and slides interconnect so that you can do most without leaving the water or giving up your inflatable ring. This latter point shouldn't really be an issue but trying to find, beg, filch a ring isn't the sort of experience I would expect. With the park very quiet I would have expected better.Generally I was underwhelmed by the rides. With no queues it was possible to do them all in a couple of hours. Given that many are similar in nature (some might even say dull) I certainly wouldn't want to queue for ages in high season.The good bits? Nice changing facilities; cleanliness; and plenty of loungers coupled with the continuous nature of the flumes means that parents can stay in one place all day whilst kids roam free.In my opinion Wild Wadi has more variety and was more fun. Both are OK for a half/full day visit - despite my strong reservations you will enjoy yourself here honestly! Obviously they're brilliant when you have free access as a hotel guest. It's all a question of value and expectation. Watch your wallet here at Aquaventure as the extras soon rack up. We didn't go with the swim with dolphin or the Lost Chambers add-ons yet with entrance, locker and towel hire plus a modest snack lunch we were looking at over \u00a350 per adult - for a half-day visit. You pays your money...By the way - take the monorail from the park and take in the amazing Palm Jumeirah development and the Dubai skyline - the best bit of the visit!"

Unlike other waterparks we have visited this one was quite quiet.There were plenty of rubber rings even the double ones which normally you have to wait for at other waterparks. The sunbeds are really comfy and you don't have to pay for them which is great. What i was really impressed with was when you get off a slide you go into a lazy river which has all different paths to take, you can even get back to the top without getting out and walking up all the steps again as there is a slide which pushes you back up amazing!! Also if you stay on the lazy river you can go on the rapids which are great fun. I very much enjoyed Shark Attack which is a slide you use your rubber ring for, you end up in a tunnel with sharks and fishes swimming all around you it was really good. I didn't brave the big tall one but my partner did and said it was good you also go through a tunnel on that one but he said your going so fast you don't see anything but water spray. If you go to the top of the pyrimid where all the slides are you have great views over Dubai so make sure you have your camera ready. We paid for a combined ticket into the Lost Chambers of Atlantis, it was ok but nothing amazing once you have seen one aquarim you have seen them all."

For the bold and daring this is a great experience; for those who hate heights this is an 8 second feeling of complete dread which culminates in a massive adrenaline rush - didn't even see the sharks!! The whole park is excellent with a great layout of lazy rivers, rapids and slides which can be ridden on rubber rings for one or two people. For anybody who loves water then this is a perfect place to come. It's not cheap (\u00a3100+ for two adults) but its great fun!"

            "review": "Should have been better than the Wild Wadi. As we had a 4 night stay at the Atlantis hotel, we had free use of the Aquaventure water park included. A big bonus given the rather high entrance fee for non hotel resident visitors.I have previously been to the Wild Wadi and several other water parks to make a comparison.The centrepiece of Aquaventure is the 27.5 metre tall, The Leap of Faith. As you wait for your turn at the top you get to enjoy magnificent views from the Palm Island looking towards the new Dubai skyline. So much so that you will soon return with your camera to take snaps. In theory you will catapult down a transparent tunnel and through a shark filled lagoon. However as with similar rides of this kind, you move down so fast that you can hardly keep your eyes open and even if you did, you will see not see anything. A ride concept defeated by the laws of physics. Again the Wild Wadi has a similar big slide in the Jumeirah Sceirah.Shark attack is another ride where you go through twisting tunnels but again I did not see much of the sharks even though you descend more slowly into the lagoon.The rest of the rides are a series of interconnected tube rides mixed in with a lazy river. This is again similar to a concept the Wild Wadi has with the Master blasters.For younger kids the water playground has thrills with two huge tipping buckets spin the release torrents of water, climbing frames and rope bridges lead to water slides. You can even soak others with water jets.Life guards are everywhere to keep an eye on guest safety. Food and drinks are expensive; we managed to get a sun bed before they all went and kept our stuff there. As there are a lot of tube rides they were sometimes in short supply especially two ringed ones that we wanted for some rides.However, it\u2019s only a half day excursion and if it was not free entrance for Atlantis guests I would baulk at paying full price. I do feel that its in need for some more individual rides such as more pure water slides and a few raft type rides that you could go with a larger group of people.In a sense the limitations of the park has set up the heated question of which waterpark in Dubai is the best. Both parks have something to offer. The fact that this newer park should have demolished the competition by being more bold and diverse with its attractions but it did not means the debate rages on. In a sense this should have been better and is not."

Hubby and I went for the day to the waterpark for the day in November whilst staying with friends in Dubai and had a fabulous day.It is pretty expensive at about \u00a330 per adult and a locker for the day about \u00a310 but the facilities are excellent and the level of service from the staff exceptional that it felt worth it.It's fairly newly opened so everything is in good condition The changing rooms are beautiful to the point that I almost felt guilty walking in dripping wet!There are a range of rides from fairly sedate floating round calm rivers to more turbulent rapids, and a number of flumes of different speeds in cluding one that actually takes you upwards! All the rides are all, bar the big drop, done on rubber rings of which their are plenty of both single and double options. If you don't want to walk anywhere and don't want to climb stairs you can pretty much make your way round all the rides on the rubber ring with travellators taking you uphill where required.The place was over-run with staff with lifeguards at every turn but all were ever so friendly and helpful.There is a massive aquarium with sharks that one of the ring rides goes through at a leisurely pace. The big drop from the zigarat also shoots through the shark pool but you don't have chance to see a thing it's so fast!There are plenty of places to sit and sun yourself if you prefer and a kids splash area that looked fun. There are also quite a number of eateries.Over the far side of the park is a dolphin lake and if you are feeling flush you can pay to get in the water with them."

I went the other week with my 18 year old son and once you've done the 'Leap of faith' that's it as far as 'ringless' chutes are concerned. In fairness the 'Leap of Faith' is a good ride but because it's the only chute you can't use a ring on there was a massive queue each time we used it - the first time we quesed for about 10 minutes, which is OK, the second time nearly half an hour and the third time the queue was so long we estimated over an hour's wait! The rest of the rides you are simply sat in a rubber ring and carried round at varying degrees of speed from slow to almost stationary. One of the main reasons we went to Aquaventure rather than Wild Wadi was the pictures we'd seen of people floating through a perspex chute (on a ring) through a shark tank - it looked stunning - in reality the inside of the plastic tube is so misted with condensation from the differences in water and air temperatures that you can hardly see a thing - again a massive disappointment. We also went here thinking we could go into Atlantis, which is next door to the water park, and have a coffee - you can but only into an area that resembled a bus cafe - you can't actually get into the hotel's lobby for more civilised surroundings - the hotel guards see to that. It's also not easy to get to - we took the Metro to Mall of the Emirates and then taxi but we wanted to use the Monorail coming back and that means trying to get a taxi from the 'Gateway' (where the monorail ends) to the Mall to get the Metro - taxi's are cheap but for some reason getting a taxi from the Gateway is really hard - there aren't any! So in summary if you like floating round in a rubber ring then go for it - otherwise don't bother."

It was great to see the Palm resort and the Atlantis hotel is stunning. Get there early and secure a sunbed and go on some of the slides with less people around plus the staff get more involved.. ie pushing me into a whirlpool (v. fun)! You may also want to bring a sarong/cover up for when eating as unlike other waterparks you'll find lots of people are fully clothed which made me feel a bit underdressed in my swimsuit.We spent the whole day on the slides etc and also walked down to the beach and swam in the Sea. My favourite was the Shark slide (not sure of exact name) was brilliant as you go down a tube through a huge fishtank of sharks rays and tropical fish swimming all around. The only issue is the price for entry and food which is overpriced especially for families but I can understand they want to keep the exclusive, high end feel of the resort."

Although rides from the Ziggurat often involved queueing, the Rapids ride is fun, quite extensive and because it is continuous and goes past several concrete beaches, you can join in without queueing.Arrive early as there's so much to do. When it gets busier, you can relax on the sandy beach on the landward side of the Palm, or swim in the sea.As the monorail station is right by the waterpark entrance, this would be a good way to arrive if you get the taxi to drop you at the Gateway Station. The monorail is due to be extended to connect with the metro (2011?). At the end of the day, taxis were hard to find at Gateway Station and it's not practicable to walk to the metro."

We had read the reviews on Tripadvisor, and all seemed to say that it was busy, nowhere to eat and very expensive. Looked at the Wild Wadi, but after speaking with the Hotel it appeared Wild Wadi (the original water park) is now quite dated, and rides are more suitable for smaller children. They therefore all set off, to try Aquaventure. The setting at the Atlantis Hotel was amazing. Look out for the aquarium which is huge. Lockers and towels could be rented, but pretty expensive - take your own towels if possible. Rides were really good, and no queues anywhere - but we did visit during Ramadan and it was exceptionally quiet everywhere. My husband said on a busy July/August day with hundreds of people, he could understand why other reviewers were not too happy - it was quite chaotic, and not sign posted too well either. He couldn't find anywhere to eat either, unless you went out of the Park and into the Hotel - again, if you take a picnic that would solve that particular problem... plenty of sunbeds available, and overall a fantastic day out. Promotional cost per person (kids classed as adults) was 200AED each (\u00a334). Usually 295 AED, so a good saving.

We opted not to take advantage of the 150AED valet parking and parked in the lot. Once there we found out that we had to take a shuttle to the waterpark. Fortunately, we arrived right at opening and there were very few other people around so we got on without a wait. The shuttle bus parks around the corner from the monorail station - quite a walk to even get to the hotel. From there you have to walk through the entrance to the hotel to find the waterpark. It seems like a pretty poor set up - soggy water park patrons mixing with dressed up restaurant and hotel guests.There was only one staff working at the entrance so quite a line up formed before they finally opened up another line. We had 2 for 1 tickets, so the admission fee was reasonable. But add to that the cost of a locker and towels if you need them $$$$$. Most of the walkways are covered and most of the ones that are not have water spraying to cool the paths - very necessary as we burned our feet crossing the bridge. Keep your water shoes with you!My son is about 118 cm and the minimum height for the big rides is 120cm. At least the staff appear to consisently enforce this rule. Because he couldn't go on the big rides, we spent most of the time on the rapids and torrents in the rivers - nice long rides and pretty fun too. The only other thing he could do was the children's area. There was a pretty good variety there.There are only 6 big slides and they all have the same entry point. I imagine there would be major line ups and congestion if it was busy. We didn't try them all, but they looked unique. Many of the slides are covered tunnels.We found the food and beverages to to very expensive. Opted not to buy, so I don't know about the quality or quantity.Apparently there are only 2 shuttle busses to the parking lot and they come at greater than 15 minute intervals. We were glad we left early in the afternoon and the park was not busy. Even so, the bus was completely full. Overall I would have to say that Aqua Adventure is not good value for the money.

Within aquaventure there were many areas to sit with individual parasols, this was very helpful and it didnt seem busy. Eating within the waterpark was reasonably priced and I would advise taking a cool box with water in. Only negative is to watch out for queue jumpers!Overall a great day out for the whole family!"

My favourite part was the \"lazy\" river with rapids......ive never been on one where there is a travelator that takes you up hill and then down rapids, truly amazing and fun! water was quite cheap in the park too, \u00a31.70 a bottle. The staff were great, plenty of rubber rings. Also the torrent was fantastic, one of the staff pulled you into a part of the lazy river and you were met with a rush of water that was released from a flood gate, you were then surged down the lazy river wih the occasional wave from the flood gate.....even funnier that we both went over the top of 2 small boys!So good, that we have booked to stay in atlantis next year on our way back from OZ!"

During a 2 day stopover staying at the Atlantis hotel, we, that's me mum, Tom aged 13 and Jacko aged10 had a fabulous time here in the park, free entry because we were hotel guests, so we had a seesion in the morning's and went back for another one after lunch.Life guards every 20 metres, On the rapids I kept my eyes shut for the first 4, I was in a double tube with Jacko, Tom leading the way in a single, looking back and lauighing at his mother scared, exhilarated,enthralled, excited, 60 emotions a minute, amazing place.Your so safe all the time, although it dosent look like you are, bobbing along in the warm water, what's that noise? look back and wow where did that come from, a tidal wave behind you, towering above you, then your picked up, up, up on top of the wave you look down and theres the other people in tubes in frnt of you, your gonna swamp them land on top of them, collide with them, but NO! magically they move up as you move down . Smiling lifeguards watching your every move. And it goes on through all levels of excitement the splashers children area, with fantastic tubes, and swings and slides and 2 buckets that fill, and fill and fill abit more, gives a little wobble, then down they come, shrieks of laughter from thechildren, their parents and grand parents, just the best fun.The shark attack teases you as you glide through the clear tank watching them watching you, another level of adrenalin, wonderment and pure enjoyment.Food and drinks sold in the park are good and plentiful, heapos of sun bed's with their own shade shelters so you can have as much or as little as you want.Everywhere you go, look, walk you're greeted by friendly efficient staff,the whole place is immaculately clean, just a wonderful place.Was fantastic to have the hotel to retreat to, to get your breath back and have a rest before going back in for another session.Was 43 degrees when we were there in late June, so not crowded, but every nationality and language all screaming in excitement and laughing in pleasure. do yourselves a favour and go."

            "review": "Go on Thursday nights in the summer for the fun atmosphere. I give this park 4/5 stars because for the price it could have more attractions. However, we went this past Thursday night because it's 175 AED and on Thursdays it's open from 8-12 at night and features a DJ and a fantastic fireworks finale. However this park would be fun at anytime as it is new, clean and super fun. Just be prepared though to spend an arm and a leg as locker rental is another 40 dirhams and each picture they take of you in the water can be purchased in the gift shop for another 65 dirhams. Bring your own towels, H2O and snacks and that should save some money that could be better spent elsewhere."

            "review": "Great ride with a Summer Promo. To be worth it, get at least a night stay at Atlantis to get an unlimited entry to Aquaventure and Lost Chambers for 2 days . Great water rides but not on regular or peak season since you have to shell out dhs 295 per entry. My family paid only dhs 800 per nite stay at the Hotel plus 20% which i think was a good deal. Aquaventure was great except that you'll have to bring your own towel if you are not a hotel guest. Sorry also they don't have a shower gel and soap neither shampoo at the shower room so might as well bring your own or bring home the viruses. Can't they provide some for the people just like wildwadi? You also have to pay for your own locker for dhs 40."

            "review": "Great fun, but not as many rides as you might expect. we went there on a weekday with a couple of friends, so it was quite quiet, don't want to imagine this place on a weekend, esp since all the slides start from the same tower, so I am sure there would be a traffic jam. Go after 3pm, then it's much cheaper. rental of anything is expensive, so try to bring your own towel etc (although you don't really need one, as you will be on the rides all the time, esp if you come after 3 - park closes at 6).the rides are fun, but most of them go through dark tunnels, so keep that in consideration if you're afraid of darkness. All slides are with tubes (apart from the kid's I think) I personally didn't do the leap of fate or whatever it's called, but friends liked it. there's a kid's area too, but didn't go there.the canals didn't have a lot of water in them when we where there, maybe that's why it's cheaper after 3?food is also expensive and not very satisfying, bring your own food & water. no water fountains in the park.overall, a fun place to see, as long as you don't expect tons of slides (haven't been to Wild Wadi, but some waterparks in Italy and Germany, which were much larger, but didn't have such a nice design)"

            "review": "Terrible waterpark!!. Hardly any rides in the park and very expensive not worth what you pay for!! we paid AED285 each entrance fee which is about GBP50 each. You also had to pay GBP6 for a towel and GBP10 for a locker. The rides are not impressive, they have few tube slides you go on with rings and the water was not forceful enough. There seems to be so much open space and not enough rides seems better for kids. The private beach was horrible to swim in and felt dirty and very cold as is man made and nothing compared to the beach on the main land! There is also hardly any direction where to go to and you have to find your way round!! Definately would not recommed it, the wild wadi water park in jumeriah area is much nicer."

            "review": "Great Fun. Great fun! It's lacking a few water rides to equal Disney's blizzard bleach, but this park holds it's own. The Leap of Faith is very thrilling and much steeper than similar ones in other water parks. The river ride is full of rapids, dips and waves. The shark ride which goes through the shark tank is fun as well. We ate at Barracuda's restaurant two times and it was almost completely empty and the prices are good with a combo meal for 35 -40 dirhams. This park also has it's own beach, with beach sports such as beach volleyball. We got our towels free since we were hotel guests otherwise would have been 30 dhs. Photos were taken and were 65 dirhams for a 5 x 7. The locker in the changing room was 50 dhs and the changing room was very clean. We spent a whole day of great fun here for four days and really enjoyed ourselves."

            "review": "Aquaventure and dolphins at Atlantis in Dubai. This can be either a family day out, a couples day out or an outing for a small group of friends. At Dhs750, it could not be considered a 'cheap day out', but the overall experience is fun. Your entry fee buys you access to the dolphins and to Aquaventure. Whatever the staff tell you, it doesn't give you entry to the aquarium. This is an additional Dhs75. Our intention was to see the dolphins and then go to the water park. The best part is the dolphin experience. The educational presentation which precedes your interaction is slick and highly informative. The experience is powerful and you know that the dolphins are well looked after and their personalities taken into consideration during their training. Within your entry fee is a locker, soft drinks and a towel. The electronic locker key is a great idea but not transferable to the water park.If you did not have the forethought to bring your own towel, this will cost you a further Dhs30; and unless you have a portable safe, a locker will cost an additional Dhs50 (about \u00a310) which for most travellers is a bit steep because you don't get your Dhs80 back! You would do well to do some planning before you arrive if there are more than two of you.Nearly all of the rides start from the Ziggurat although there can be a queue for some of the rides - and we went during the week. They can be a bit the samey after about 4 rides. Adrenalin junkies might be a bit disappointed. You are not automatically given a map of layout of the park and it's not obvious how to access the rides from outside the ziggurat (or even where the sitting areas are). I suggest to grab a map before you go in so you can decide where to sit.The resort has great sun beds. Each has an individual shade which can be adjusted to suit your needs as the sun passes over you during the course of the day. Also, the food is very reasonably priced within the water park and the service is quick at each of the service areas. There is a great queuing system for ordering food in the main cafe which regrettably falls down because the cashiers don't keep a float.The rubber rings could be problematic if you were overweight (not as substantial as the Wild Wadi ones?). I'm 65kg and ended up with a bruised gluteus maximus which was very uncomfortable. The little launch converyor belts are quite fun though . Those with children need to measure them before going as some of the rides do not allow children under 1.2m. There is however no visible measuring instrument on site so it's up to the conveyor belt 'monitor' to decide whether or not your child can go on the ride. The most irritating thing about our experience was the fact it took us a good 20 minutes to find two rubber rings. This was highly irritating especially as the staff were unhelpful on this matter (I asked four staff in different parts of the resort) and there was no obvious point of collection. I also just had a feeling that the staff in the main restaurant were not properly trained, but the water -based staff dotted around the waterways were a joy. You always felt safe even if you occasionally bumped your head, stumped your foot on the bottom or walked away with bruises. They are armed with whistles to ensure you don't commit any misdemeanours.....If you've never been to a water park before, this is a great start. Some of the 'dark' rides might be a bit frightening for young children, but hey, that's what the adrenalin rush is all about, isn't it?"

            "review": "Still needs to get its act together..... Well it's impressive...I'll give you that! I mean the whole complex: the hotel, the Aquaventure Water Park and the Lost Chambers aquarium. I visited the place with my 9 year old son in the end of October 08 and I believe the place opened sometime in September. It's build on Dubai's newest and most ambitious project \"The Palm\", which is basically an artificial city in the sea! I got a very strange feeling the moment I passed the bridge and onto the island... it was like \"what if something happens and the whole palm shaped island collapses or gets swollen up by a big Tsunami or something? Anyway we arrived there by Taxi and were not allowed to be dropped off in the front of the Hotel Entrance but were directed to go further on and into the parking area of the water park. There we had to wait for the park's bus to take us back to the Hotel's Entrance... (???). We paid AED 220/ about USD 61.00 per person (kids over 1.10 pay the same as adults). But be warned: this was a special price valid the end of October 08. The park is not huge...actually smaller than the Wild Wadi across the main land by the Jumeira Beach Hotel. It has limited rides: there is a lazy river which I admit it was fun as it had parts with mini tsunami waves that my son really enjoyed. Also there is a ride that you end up in an all glass tube inside a shark aquarium and you actually have the fish swim on all sides... The Lost Chambers aquarium was in my opinion the best attraction... It is VERY impressive with a big variety of fish and just the size on the main aquarium is something I was not expecting. Now the bad points: there is a beach (man made of course like the whole island). I was so disappointed... the whole edge of the beach was covered in this white foam and the sea was not clean at all... There is only one Food Outlet and it\u2019s only for Take Away the only problem is, there is no area to sit and enjoy your meal! We had to actually sit on the steps and eat our sandwich as all the sun beds by the pool area were taken and ours were a bit far at the beach area. I also found the food a bit overpriced, which \u2026fine you expect this I guess, it happens in most places BUT if you order a plain sandwich it goes together with a soft drink and a pack of crisps (either you like this or not) and of course you pay for them. I had to pay extra and buy my son a bottle of water as he doesn\u2019t like soft drinks and they wouldn\u2019t make the exchange! But the worst was our departure: we had to wait for 1 hour and 45 minutes in queue for a Taxi (STANDING)! It was a nightmare... Here's a tip: leave BEFORE the park closes... other wise be prepared for a good hour's wait for a Taxi..."
