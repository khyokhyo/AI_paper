The elevator gave us the color of the visit...weird noise, are we arrived? Smiling around and the door was finally opening on a surprising roof with so strange figures cut in the cloudy sky, with sometimes a ray of sunshine...It's amazing to deambulate in the attic and the Mila's appartement is intersting. Don't miss this visit! Don't miss Gaudi's crazy imagination!I went to the Palau de la musica catalana in the same day to listen to a concert. What a magic place also!I hope the one who has shared these emotions will read these lines."

We made the mistake of not booking tickets online so we arrived around 4pm on a Saturday and there was a bit of a queue which we had to stand in for around 30 mins. So book your tickets online! Upon entry, you get the audioguide you are taken up in a lift to the very top where you get to see Gaudi's work up close. Simply fascinating and will always be a masterpiece. As it was early October and late in the afternoon, the sun wasn't very hot and it was just perfect for taking pictures.You then have to go down the stairs visiting each floor to see the inside of the structure, where there are exhibits of models of his other works, the history of Barcelona and La Pedrera and also what items and animals in nature inspired Gaudi's work. For 20.50 euros for individual entry it is not cheap but is worth a visit."

You can only enter a night tour at certain times depending on the language you speak. You start off in the main entrance with an introduction to Gaudi and the building. There is then the option to take the stairs or lift (the stairs are very tiring!) to the attic. In the attic there are models of Gaudi's work, allowing you to see his concepts and designs. Our tour guide was great and very informative. Then you are up on the roof for the spectacular light show, there are only about 30 on each tour so you get a good view of the lights. We were then told that the tour would finish up in the basement for drinks and snacks. We were allowed to walk round half of the roof on our way down which was great, and we were pretty much just left to it! In the end we were the last people left on the roof. The views of Barcelona are great!Once downstairs, there is choice of champagne, juice or water and some snacks. The tour lasted approximately 90 minutes. This was great to do for our last night in Barcelona and we were pleased to have chosen the night tour instead of the day tour."

The audio guide for La Pedera is rather more basic and the need to queue for the lift at the beginning of the tour was tedious. Having said that, this is an extraordinary building illustrating the range of Gaudi's mastery of engineering design and his artistic flair. The roof is perhaps the most unusual example of Gaudi's work, but take care - the stepped design can be hazardous and one visitor had a fall whilst I was there.The attic beneath the roof is also intriguing with the succession of catenary arches giving the impression of walking through a giant rib cage!Setting aside the overall design concept I found the period furnishing of the sample apartment set the context of genteel wealth of the era in which Gaudi was working. I'm not sure that the apartment would be easy to live in, but that's a retrospective view of course, and ignores the benefit of having servants."

After a quick intro on the first floor where they discussed some of the building's early history - first residential elevator and underground car port in the city for example, we went up to the \"attic\" which was amazing. It is a must see. Afterwards, there was a totally non-cheesy laser light show on the roof in the open air. Finally, we sipped champagne in the courtyard. Yes, it was expensive, but it was a perfect way to end the day. We would both highly recommend it. The guide was saying that there are still four, rent stabilized (\u20ac 300 a month) private residences in the building and the rest are corporate offices. Pretty weird for a privately (bank) owned UNESCO world heritage site. The tour was very small and intimate (10 people) and the guide was excellent and answered my many questions with a smile and informed responses. Remember to hit the helpful button if this was of any use. Total tour time was about an hour."

            "review": "An essential visit when in Barcelona . It's hard to visit Barcelona without getting drawn in to the world of genius artist Antoni Gaudi and his fantastical creations. Even if you think you have little interest in architecture or art, his unique creations will have you enthralled. This is house is on the list of the top 5 Gaudi sites in town, as well as the Familia Sagrada, Parc Guell, Casa Botlla and Palace Guell.We visited mid-afternoon on a Wednesday and there was no queue for tickets, but it may be best to book ahead at weekends or holidays to avoid unnecessary queues. We spent around 90 minutes here and it cost around 20 euros as an adult. For this you get an audio guide with headphones to take you round the house. The queue for the lift to the roof terrace was long so we took the stairs - 8 flights! - so if you're not in good shape, wait! The roof terrace is what people primarily go to see. Roman helmets replace chimney covers, undulating floors fold away around you and hobbit holes bridge sections. Unique, colourful and quite bonkers - it's Gaudi at his best. Beware that if it's raining or has rained recently the terrace is closed because it's slippery under foot. You don't want to miss the terrace and luckily the rain in Spain falls... not too often!The rest of the visit includes a detailed look at the mechanics of his designs, common themes he incorporates as well as his ergonomic furniture. You also get to explore a furnished apartment, which is fascinating.Fir culture in digestible chunks you can't go far wrong."

Most of the building is still occupied by private residents, so you get to see only one apartment, decorated as it would have been when it was first built, and the roof. The rooves at Casa Batlo and Palau Guell are more impressive in my opinion. If you can only afford to see one Gaudi building, I wouldn't choose this one."

The apartment house is a study in details. everything from the building itself to the furniture down to the to the door knobs and drawer pulls was designed and supervised by Gaudi himself.

The roof with its chimneys in the form of freely drawn mythical creatures and view of the tower of the Sagrada Familia in the distance provides great opportunities to observe Gaudy's exterior architectural embellishments close-up as well as have a great view over the Eixample district of Barcelona, so take your camera up there with you. Underneath the roof is the attic space which houses original models and drawings but above all allows the visitor to see the extraordinary form of the underneath supports to the Pedrera's roof. As many others have said before, it really is like being in the belly of a whale. An extraordinary feeling. Further down t he building is an apartment preserved, decorated and furnished as it would have been 100 years ago shorty after the Pedrera was first occupied. This gives insights into middle class life in Barcelona at the time, but more particularly demonstrates Gaudy's ability to use his creativity in order to enhance even the mundane in everyday living."

La Pedrera can be visited by night as well, with an amazing light show, so even if you will visit it by day , by night it will be different, maybe magical. Beside the rooftop there is a museum , a walk through history how people used to live , but there is a little history of the master himself , Antonio Gaudi, so it definitely worth visiting and hearing how he made this piece of art ."

The first main point of interest is the fact the building retains its integrity after a century of scrutiny. It remains an appartment building occupied by tenants, save for one unit, reserved as a showcase for Gaudi's genius, and a witness to gracious living in 1900. The most interesting part of the whole thing is the roof, a veritable sculpture of tile and terrace and chimney and air-vents. The views are terrific. Next, the renovated attic, with its beautifully original arches meandering around the volume above the appartments. Here we find the museum part of the building. The audio guide is a must. Next, one floor down to the model appartment, where period furniture and fixtures show what life was like in the 1900's. Visitor alert here. When buying tickets we were offered a free photograph at the end of the visit. Sure enough, a pleasant young lady snapped a couple of shots in front of a green screen, then asked us which we preferred. We made our choice only to be told we had to purchase one (10 euro) in order to get the \"free\" one.

After seeing a short slide show with music and being shown around the lower level, we were taken up the servants' stairs (you could choose the elevator, and I breathlessly encourage you to do so) seven floors to the attic of the building. The attic undulates and its beams look very much like the skeleton of a sea snake. There are a number of exhibits to view all around it before climbing to the roof for the sound and light show, which imagines what Gaudi's influences were which led to his designs. This was the best part of the visit, as you stand on an undulating roof in the night air populated by a number of oddly shaped structures upon which images are projected. It was a very artistic and novel presentation that we will not forget, high above the Passeig de Gracia. After the show, we returned to the ground floor to enjoy several glasses of cava with our fellow guests. Highly recommended!"

Unfortunately on the day we visited it was pouring down and the roof terrace was closed which was a great pity. The building is so unusual and like nothing I have ever seen. The tour starts off in the attic which is absolutely stunning and then moves the the flat which is a real step back in time.

The building has been wonderfully preserved and renovated. The exhibits very nicely tell about Gaudi's perspective and building techniques. Working your way up the floors, one ends the tour on the roof, which is delightful. This building is a must-see when in Barcelona. However, like the other Gaudi attractions, buy your tickets on-line to get a reserved time for your visit. Otherwise, you may spend a good bit of time in a long line waiting to buy your ticket and to get in. The tour companies appear to bring all of their guests here - as evidenced by the line of tour buses parked on the adjacent street."

First, since most of the apartment building is occupied, only one apartment is available for viewing, and it is nothing out of the ordinary. Second, the rooftop terrace, where the tour begins and which is supposed to be the highlight, is nice, but in my opinion not as interesting as either the terrace at nearby Casa Battlo or at Palau Gaull, which to me is the best of the Gaudi residential architecture which can be toured.  After the terrace, the next stop is an audio-visual exhibit of the construction of the building, what Barcelona was like in those times, and some photos of some of Gaudi's other projects, like La Sagrada Familia, Parc Guell and Casa Battlo. Much better to see them in person. That is followed by the apartment and, of course, the gift store.  For the high price of more than 20 Euros, you get very little value I am sorry to say. Save your money and go see the much less visited Palau Guell, off La Rambla, which easily is ten times as interesting."

The existing building was demolished. It has 5 floors. Much bigger than Casa Batilo also in Barcelona. The owner lived on the first floor. There still are a few tenants. Gaudi wanted the people in the building to all know each other. So the lifts are only available on every second floor so people are forced to associate with one another. The building, the walls, the ceilings, the windows, the shape of the rooms etc; do not have a single straight line. Casa Mil\u00e0 (another name of this building) is the result of two buildings, built around two courtyards which provide natural light and ventilation to five floors, ground floor, mezzanine, the basement and an attic. The basement was intended to be the garage. The main floor was the residence of the Mil\u00e0s (a flat of all 1,323 m2), and the rest distributed over 20 apartments for rent. The resulting layout is shaped like an asymmetrical \"8\" because of the different shape and size of the courtyards. The attic housed the laundry and drying areas, forming an insulating space for the building and simultaneously determining the levels of the roof. The roof has skylights, staircase exits, fans, and chimneys."

Casa Mila, probably more popularly known as La Pedrera, is situated on Passeig de Gracia, within walking distance of Casa Batllo and even Placa Catalunya. I say this, because many people queue, in the busy season, for a long time to get onto the Bus Touristica at Placa Catalunya, when it would actually be easier and quicker to walk from there (Placa Catalunya) to Casa Batllo. Once that has been visited, you can then walk along Passeig de Gracia to La Pedrera, and catch the bus from that stop once you have finished there. Your hotel should be able to sell you tickets for the tour buses when you arrive and you can ask for a route map, which will show you what I mean. The building itself is yet another of Gaudi\u2019s wonders and today it houses a cultural centre. As with all Gaudi buildings, it is the architectural design that grabs the eye and the imagination. Like Casa Batllo, the building itself is stunning, both inside and out. Also like Batllo, the rooftop is the most breath-taking area, with great views over the city, including a clear view of the Sagrada Familia. It is a photographers dream and the view from the street corner, with the balconies on all three faces in the frame, makes for a great shot, as does the rooftop. However, all internal areas are beautiful, including the staircases.La Pedrera should not be missed if touring the city. Be sure to take your camera, though that could be said of any of any place associated with Gaudi. Entrance costs \u20ac20.50 for adults, but is much cheaper for children under 12 at half that price. Children under 7 can enter for free."

The Basilica of the Holy Family and the Parc Guell are the outrageous biggies, of course, but La Pedrera evidence of his genius at the human, family level. His whimsical design style is every where, concealing his superb engineering and structural skills. The apartment that is part of the tour is kept as it was in the early 20th. century and is filled with light and air and large rooms that flow well and he designed much of the furniture himself (like F. L. Wright and H. Guimard). The roof is great fun to explore - there is so much whimsy in just the chimneys that one can't even see from the ground that its worth the trip up there. A well run tour that flows nicely without disturbing the real apartment dwellers on the floors that are not part of the museum tour."

It's very different architecturally to Casa Batllo, but if you are torn between the two, Casa Batllo gets my vote.Architecturally it is quite different to a lot of Gaudi's work, but the courtyard area inside is stunning, as is the roof and to a lesser extent the attic. Quite a lot of the building is inaccessible as many floors are let to businesses/residents and this is no more evident than when you have to walk up a very, very long stairwell past lots of closed doors to get to the roof at the beginning of the tour.The audio tour is very impressive and informative, but finding the numbers around La Pedrera can be difficult as they're extremely small and hard to spot (particularly in the dark attic), and it also lacks the incredible augmented reality feature that Casa Batllo has.For me the highlight is the roof, which has decent views around the city, but is just a wonderful place to explore with the witch scarer chimneys and vents, views down into the courtyards below etc.The attic was excellent, and had a very, very impressive exhibition about Gaudi and his influences. This exhibition alone probably goes into more depth than anywhere else I've seen in Barcelona and includes impressive cut-away models, physical examples of his methodologies, videos and his inspirations from nature. This really impressed me.There was also a floor decorated as a typical apartment which was fairly interesting too.My complaints, although minor, is that there is a lot of 'modern intrusion' with a few ugly fire doors, air conditioning equipment in plain view on the roof, an ugly lift shaft etc. The irony was not lost when the audio commentary was explaining how Gaudi made even functional things like vents beautiful just as I glanced over and saw lots of fans, electrical boxes etc in plain sight. The building also didn't seem to be in such good condition as Casa Batllo, with the worn/peeling paint on the walls down into the courtyards (visible from the roof) being a bit disappointing. Finally, things like the photo opportunity were not as elegantly done as at Casa Batllo (where you stand on the balcony), whereas here it's a greenscreen and they super-impose you onto a background.If you can only do either Casa Batllo or La Pedrera, then Batllo gets my vote, but the exhibition on Gaudi is very worthwhile and I definitely recommend a visit."

The show was nice, but was really just a projection of images on the sculptures. The tour leading up to it was a repeat of all that I had learned earlier. I would suggest doing one or the other, but not both on the same day. The sad part is that the wealthy couple that commissioned the building in the first place didn't like it and it was very upsetting to Gaudi. It is an amazing building and well worth touring."

Casa Mila/Pedrera, located on upscale Passeig de Gracia, is a 5 floor apartment building with an open central courtyard. It was built for the Mila family who lived in one of the apartments and rented out the others. Their living area has become an exhibition space open only for special displays. We entered through the courtyard to see the unusual wrought iron gate which used varying sizes of circles that reminded me of fish and whale mouths. The courtyard was a public space for the the apartment owners to access a stairwell to their floors. The mural ceiling over this stairwell immediately caught my eye with its speckled colors of green, avocado, rose, turquoise, and white. Having already visited 2 other Gaudi houses, I didn't find the tiled roof top vents and flues that fascinating anymore even though the shapes, clusters, and colors were different. There were also more stairs than the other two as well as an undulating floor surface. The views of Barcelona towards Park Guell and along Passeig de Gracia were good from up here. Next, we entered a large open attic area which had an excellent display of Gaudi's works. Several monitors played videos of all of his houses giving dates of construction, what he hoped to achieve with each different design, and a tour of each.There were small scale models of the homes and La Sagrada. Another display showed how a bicycle wheel design was an inspiration for several of Gaudi's construction methods. Other displays showed some of the things in nature, particularly sealife, that inspired his designs such as seashell, bones, algae, coral. Next we visited an apartment that was furnished in early 20th Century style. Children's bedrooms had toys neatly lined up around the wall perimeters; the master bedroom had a spacious ensuite with tub, pedestal sink, and toilet; storage closet was stuffed with luggage, out-of season coats, tricycle; dining room, sitting room, and kitchen were appropriately furnished; one room was for a maid; another for chores like laundry and sewing. Was this what luxury living was like in the early 1900's? There were also displays showing practical things that Gaudi designed for these apartments like knobs, handles, special mouldings around doors, wood carved benches, and chairs. For me, the memorable moments were the exhibition in the attic and the most unusual facade of Casa Pedrera. Perhaps we were just lucky, but we were able to enter immediately at 11 am on a Sunday in early September without reserved timed tickets. Audio guides are included in the admission rate. We stayed just over an hour."

This means that very few people are on the roof and so you have the space to appreciate this masterpiece, and to view the city from the particular vantage points that Gaudi's design affords you. The interior is also interesting and you get a true feeling of the structural qualities of the building and the domestic arrangement at the time of building. As it is currently lived in on certain floors you navigate around the building by lift. There are explanations of how Gaudi used the principles of natural structures and put them to use in innovative building. You can see modern reproductions of Gaudi's furniture, painstakingly remade by craftsmen, due to the fact that the original pieces had been dispersed and lost."

Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. There is a detailed explanation of the courtyard, a tour of the attic (much more interesting than it sounds) and a final stop on the surreal rooftop. There, special videos were projected on the statues, accompanied by music. It was definitely the highlight of our Barcelona stay.A few notes: The online booking agent Entradas Clorian [entradas@clorian.com] was incredibly helpful. You might want to contact them prior to booking online to inquire as to the language offered at each tour time for the date you are interested. Also- this tour required navigating narrow, steep steps in semi-dark conditions. I would do this tour again."

Unlike Casa Battlo, which was embraced as a masterpiece, La Pedrera was quite polarising, and considered ugly, due to it's scrap metal balconies and wavelike facade. It took a lot longer than Casa Battlo to build, and the owners hated it. This was the last private commission that Gaudi completed before he threw himself into the Sagrada Familia. The chimneys on top are fascinating, each one different, but overall lacks the wow factor of Casa Battlo."

It displays Gaudi's forward thinking, creativity and playful humor. His genius is manifested within every niche of this architectural play land. The exterior as well as the interior is a joyous symphony of color, shape, design and art. As visitors enter the courtyards there is a whirl of texture, color, shapes and fantasy. This feeling is enhanced on the roof terrace. The chimney and ventilation shafts, some with strategically placed arches for framing neighboring landmarks, are reminiscent of Star Wars storm troopers! Many of them tower on the edge of the roof and appear to be peering roof top guards.The attic is astonishing with its 270 brick arches. Once the laundry area, it now houses a progressive exhibition dedicated to Gaudi's creative genius and includes models, drawings, photo and videos.The fourth floor apartment is open for exploration and nicely furnished with period items. It features the unique Gaudi details: door knobs, carved plaster moldings, doors, floors, and lighting. The audiovisual is a welcome opportunity to sit and rest while watching the remarkable changes to the city which inevitably affected the final outcome of La Pedrera.HINT: At the main entrance, visitors are offered immediate entry for a premium price. We elected to walk around the corner to the ticket office where there was a short line and purchase tickets at the regular price."

They insist on you sitting through and interminably long \"light show\" where they project a series of stock images and animations on to the artistically wonderful chimneys Gaudi designed, accompanied by cheesy music. Lame and boring.They should bag this late-90s trope and instead work on lighting each chimney and sculpture for selfies and photos. Until they do, see the building during the day where the magnificence of Gaudi can be experienced without interference.However, our guide was knowledgeable and pleasant and they didn't skimp on the post-tour cava.

We purchased the self guided audio tour, but the main highlight really is the rooftop creations Gaudi made. You are allowed to go to the 4th floor and see how the floor plan to the apartment was set up, which did not interest me as much. My favorite portion was the roof and the next floor you go to. In this museum part, they describe where Gaudi found his inspiration - in everything he sees in nature. I think its over-priced for what it really is. And did not take us as long as I thought it would. Did hear that casa Batllo was worth the visit though. Will go there next time."

We booked our La Pedrera ~ Casa Mil\u00e0 visit the morning of online. It was late September and not too busy at 11:00am and spent 2 hours. During the visit we started at the courtyard/main floor area and then took the elevator to the roof. The roof is very unique, and like the other Gaud\u00ed sites in Barcelona you can appreciate his Neo-Gothic to modernism designs from the structure's tiles, glass, wood and wrought iron. After the roof you walk stairs down to the Attic with its exceptional arched brick design and buttresses. In the attic are many models of his works and a good video/photo history of Gaud\u00ed. The last stop is the huge top floor apartment and all its rooms and furnishings. A true sight considering it was 1906-1912. Overall our visit was great and memorable. It was nice to poke around and take pictures and without issue from staff. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. We passed on the audio guide but wishing I had taken the option. A great stop to combine with his other works. "

Saturday night concerts 2x a month on the rooftop preceded by a 1/2 hour in the attic viewing exits about Gaudi and his architecture. The jazz was fabulous as the sun set around us, aided by a glass or two of the local Penedes wine region Cava, or white bubbly.We didn't do any tours and the building has been well covered by other reviews but suffice to say if you are looking for something different to do in this beautiful building then try this out. You must pre book and the cost is moderate, about 40 Euros from memory including 1 glass of Cava. We saw the sax player 2 nights later at the Flamenca show at La Bodega Flamenca Camaron which I also highly recommend as a cultural and entertaining experience."

It would be difficult to visit San Sebastian and not cross paths with Gaudi's wondrous architecture... perhaps impossible... but if you only see one or two works, be sure to include La Pedrera, and if you can, book ahead and get a GUIDED TOUR. Our guide was an historian, sociologist and art historian rolled into one, and he allowed us to experience Gaudi's apartment building in the context of the time it was built, something that would likely be missed on simply an audio tour. Also, although buying tickets online is recommended, we were staying nearby, and we purchased our tickets the day before on site and avoided standing in line. Besides Gaudi's sculptural approach to building, he was on the cutting edge of the time with materials and technology (one of the first elevators in Barcelona, and the first underground carriage garage, complete building ventilation system to name a few). Anyway, words cannot describe what your eyes will see... make time to visit La Pedrera!"

The night tour is interesting and informative but the light show on top at the end wasn't a must-see. Like pretty much every Barcelona attraction, I'd recommend buying tickets in advance to avoid lengthy queues (this didn't seem to be as busy as La Sag Fam or Batllo) but the express queue jump entry probably isn't worth the extra 5 odd euro a ticket. The glass of bubbly and snack at the end of the tour was a welcome surprise. All in all, a pretty good way to see some of Gaudis work and discover what it was like living in one of his works."

The roof has it's points of interest, it is Gaudi after all, for example the twisted chimneys and the undulating floor but overall it is not a patch on Casa Batllo. A further point is that the lines of the roof and the general perspective are somewhat spoiled by the abundance of safety fencing and fire doors all replete with large notices.

Without it, you may feel a little lack of information. The guide takes you through the exposition in a logical sequence and it is enjoyable to follow it. Sometimes it just plays you music, but it is enjoyable to listen to it and it makes the tour more emotional.

However, it is well worth visiting and see the interesting shapes and technology that Gaudi introduced to his work. The roof shapes developed for the chimneys are extremely modern, considering when this was designed nad built. A display is also given in the attic of a number of other buildings designed by Gauldi. The visit to the Apartment was also good to see the architecture, but also how those with means, lived in those days."

The current renters pay a rate that was fixed in the 1930's and that, by law, cannot be raised.

Interesting since it is Gaudi's last building before he concentrated all his time on Sagrada Familia--a less personal, commercial design that still manages to incorporate his accumulated ideas to date. There are current businesses there in the building in addition to the museum style exhibit spaces. The audio guide is free and is ok, but not that necessary. The tour begins with an elevator ride up to the rooftop. (Warning to those who are afraid of heights or have difficulty with steps, there is not an easy way from there to the next lower level where the exhibits begin). The rooftop is an open maze of steps and fantastic chimney structures, and nice views of the city. The next level down has nice scale models and exhibits about this and other Gaudi work. Next level down has recreated an apartment with all furnishings of the period, so you can imagine the style in which they lived. Lots of steps down from here, although an elevator is available if you can find it! There is a nice gift shop on the way out. Overall worthwhile, but if you only have time for one or two Gaudi buildings, I'd say this is a distant third to #1 Sagrada Familia and #2 Casa Batllo."

Plan to spend about an hour to wander through and be amazed at the stunning architecture, and fabulous rooftop as previous reviewers have said. Paid 20.50 euros without audio, as there is so much information on the displays etc. that it wasnt necessary for us. There is a lift to the roof, but I think we had to walk down about 5 floors. There is also a gift shop on the main floor to pick up souvenirs. TIP buy the hop on hop off bus ticket..stops at 40 different places, including Gaudi buildings."

We had not booked this online but seemed to hit it at a rare quiet time in the afternoon. There is a lot to see here on every floor. But all the marvelling we did at the staircases, the rooms, the doors, the lightwells etc, nothing prepared us for stepping out onto the roof. We were speechless.

Inside the huge building was wonderful, so curvy and sinuous as if it had just grown out of the ground. As this is still a working building you are directed quite quickly to the rooftop. There is a lift, but as the queue was long we opted to climb the stairs,slowly! Once on the roof it was amazing, I found the audio tour helpful and it pointed out some fascinating features. Who else would cover chimney pots in broken champagne bottles. However the rooftop was very busy, as you had to climb up and down steps, you had to be extremely careful and constantly watch where you were going. The attic and apartment were fascinating, I loved that the apartment was set out as it would have been when the house was built. The shop was quite extensive and I liked that it concentrated on Art Noveau items. Just be careful when buying things, I was short changed by the assistant. An interesting building,but not in my opinion as Casa Batlo."

The origins evening your is definitely worth doing, you meet outside before going into one of the courtyards for a talk about Gaudi and the history of the house. I think this is where the tour can be a bit variable we did it last year and the focus was very much on gaudi and religion. This year (much better) the guide explored ideas and invited you to guess what could have inspired gaudi from nature - some of it is guesswork but amazing. A lot of the building is still occupied and at night you don't get to see the apartment. You then take a long walk up to the attic floor (or use the lift), the tour continues under the roof arches which feel like being in the belly of a whale you can see the history of the building and explore gaudi's designs and inspiration from the tiles on the street outside the building to furniture and the Sagrada design. A lot of gaudi's later designs are inspired by nature - the rooftop tour and light show is a projection of the history of man evolving with nature, very well put together and beautiful to see stood on top of the building with great views. It helps you visualise the inspirations from nature when you do visit the Sagrada. Make sure you visit after sundown as the light show looks best when it's truly dark. After the show you continue around the roof terrace notice the chimney pots that inspired the Star Wars storm trooper helmets and then down to another courtyard for a glass of cava and biscuits to the end the tour all in all about 1hr 15 minutes. Kids love the light show."

Our tour guide was a Spanish lady and, I must say, her English was not very clear to everyone, unfortunately. After this we were suggested to walk (or go by elevator) to the attic of the building (note that you will NOT see any of the apartments inside La Pedrera during the tour, unfortunately, because there are still people leaving inside those - yes, lucky people!). The attic contained some bits of other interesting things: furniture designed by Gaudi, a model of the entire building which helps you to see the building from every side in more details, and other historical exhibits. After this we were brought to the roof of the building - and the most amazing part of the tour started! The roof was fully decorated with interesting and famous elements made by Gaudi, and additionally to this all the roof parts were lit up with the special lights and accompanied by special music effects - it was a real show! We have spent at least 15 minutes enjoying ourselves on the roof with a great view on the night Barcelona - was very romantic and unforgettable. After we went back downstairs to the hall on the ground floor - we were offered a glass of cava with some chocolate cookies as snacks. We enjoyed this evening!"

The light and music show was an interesting way to enjoy the rooftop sculptures.The only caution was that there was no clear signage or directions for someone who could not negotiate the stairs down. The tour guide left us up on the rooftop and we had to figure out how to get down by elevator on our own.However, the greeter out front was exceptionally welcoming."

The visit starts on the roof from where you get great views of La Sagrada Familia. The brick vaulted attics contain a good exhibition explaining Gaudi's technique and showing other buildings then finishes in an apartment which gives a great view of life in the early 1900s. The queue was not long but better to buy tickets online so you go straight up to the audio guide desk (audio guide included and very good).In summer you can also book a \"day and night\" ticket and return to the roof which is illuminated for drinks."

Refurbished in the early 20th century to serve as an income producing residence for Gaudi (he rented out a number of apartments four floors of which are still rented out today), the \"house\" is most renowned for his artistic approach to the roof where he created unique sculptures to conceal chimneys and air vents. The facade of the building is also unique and must be seen even if you don't go in to the museum. Like his style or not, Gaudi's vision was like no other. Once you've seen one of his creations, you will have no problem identifying his signature approach elsewhere."

Doors open at 8.15 and we began with a visit to the attic before heading up to the roof. There are no chairs but attendees sat on the roof stairs and along the walls. The music started at 9 and lasted about an hour. The sound set up was excellent. If the weather is good like it was when we visited, the roof is a magnificent place to take in the great city views and explore the architectural features of the top of La Pedrera.

To save time, you may want to book in advance, though I went on a Wednesday afternoon without any problem. The rooftop is magnificent--and look out for the way one of the rooftop arches frames the Sagrada Familia. It's best to step back a dozen meters for your photo vs. taking it under the arch itself (like everyone else does--therefore blocking the intended framing/view). In the restored attic, you will find some great exhibits about Gaudi's other famous landmarks and would be reason alone for a visit. The apartment interiors are well done and a glimpse into how residents lived in this landmark. The ground level courtyards are also a sight to behold."

Once you get to the roof, there are no seats so you're seating on backless steps or the floor. When the concert was over, Le Pedrera did not have sufficient staff on the roof to direct a smooth exit of the hundreds of people who attended. We were told we couldn't take the elevator down and were directed to a winding staircase that we had to walk down about 10 flights to the street. In the case of a fire or other emergency, this would have been bedlam and extremely dangerous. There are no provisions whatsoever for handicap access."

We turned up without pre-booking at La Pedrera on a particularly hot July day (almost 30 degrees), but thankfully the queue on the side street put us in the shade, and was moving fairly quickly. If you're reading this before a visit, however, I'd recommend jumping the queue by booking a fast pass beforehand.The building - like everything Gaudi has created in Barcelona - is wonderful: amazing, thought-provoking and delightful to visit. The tour starts back-to-front by ascending firstly to the roof (long queues for the elevator, but the climb up the stairs isn't too bad!). Make sure first to have a good look up from ground level through the large atrium towards the roof; you'll be able to contrast the view looking back down very shortly afterwards!The roof of La Pedrera is what most people visit for. It's an explosion of different shapes, concepts and expressions which changes constantly as you move up, down and around the many surfaces. We found the whole experience slightly dizzying - there are no straight edges anywhere! - so take a minute to sit down and absorb the whole scene, plus the amazing views out over the streets of Barcelona and beyond to the hills and sea.Coming inside, you'll descend one floor into the attic, which in itself is fascinating to wonder around - it has multiple cantilever arches built entirely from brick which are wonderful to look at as they overlap into the dimly-lit interior.The attic houses a very interesting exhibit about Gaudi, some of his designs, pictures of Barcelona around that period and his amazing workshop. For me, it was utter conflict (in a good way) between wandering around enjoying the ceiling, and paying attention to the excellent exhibits on display. I would quite happily pay the entrance fee to visit this again.Another floor down, and we step back in time into a fully-preserved period apartment, giving a wonderful insight into how the wealthy inhabitants lived in those days.Each one of these three wholly-different experiences are worth the entrance fee on its own! The visit is self-guided, with an audio guide included, so you can choose your own pace to wander around and absorb as much as you wish. La Pedrera is much bigger than Casa Batllo and felt much less crowded as a result.If you have the time, buy the combined ticket for a day time visit and the illuminated night time show. If you're not sure and just want to purchase the day time ticket first, you'll have a chance to upgrade for the discounted combined price on the ground floor at the end of the visit, before you leave. We didn't have time for this on our trip, but I would definitely make time for it on a future visit - we will definitely return and re-visit La Pedrera when we next get the chance!If you're shopping for gifts for people back home, the gift shop on the ground floor has a great range of Gaudi-inspired, good-quality items, for a unique taste of Barcelona.Highly recommended."

It is rather simple in contrast to some of his other exteriors but still maintains the fluid architectural lines he is famous for. Going inside offers a glimpse of early modern \"apartment\" style living as you can go into a unit that remains much as it was in the early days of this building which stands as a deficit Gaudi Apartment building where people do live today. Less fantasy and more modern reality than some of the other sites and well worth the visit for the contrast."

I wouldn't necessarily say this is a good deal, but it's a unique tour, as you get to see the first floor, staircases, attic, and roof of one of the famous Modernisme buildings in Barcelona. They have some exhibits in the attic that kind of explain the style and I firstreally started to appreciate the intricacies of the architecture. The attic is impossible to describe; the scaffolding of the building is there and it's completely unique. You have to see it for yourself.The tour includes this weird light show on the roof. Apparently it's the 70s. Be careful on the roof.You also get some champagne at the end of the tour. I don't know if that's to justify the price or what, it's still expensive. But because this is the only way to walk through the building, it may be worth it if you're interested in modernisme."

We purchased the tickets online for the Pedrera along with dinner at the restaurant ... 58 euros each for both. The food at the restaurant was amazing and a great way to start the night. I suggest you booked it at night so you could enjoy the light show on the roof.The Pedrera itself was beautiful. Our guide explained to us the history behind Gaudi's work and it's simply amazing. You get to visit the entrance hall, the stairs that lead you to the roof and the roof itself. Don't expect to visit any of the floors. Once of the roof, yo get to enjoy the view of Barcelona and then the amazing light show begins. The light show shows you what Gaudi uses as inspiration ... nature! At the end of the tour, you get to enjoy a nice glass of sparkling wine or juice and dessert. A great way to end the tour and the night.P.S. Length of visit will reflect Tour + Restaurant"

If I remember correctly, attic is dedicated to every other building except La Pedrera and it's a no-no. Apartment rooms are mildly interesting, cause it's the only casa I've visited that's fully equipped so you feel like you could live there. Whole visit lasts one hour at most. They have no options for hard of hearing or deaf people (only free audioguides). They give you a free photo if you buy one first (same, but with different background), which is clever commercial trick. You take an elevator to the roof, but from then on you have to use a lot of stairs, so it's not for older people. I don't recommend taking tickets for jazz nights cause even if sight is wonderful, sound of the band isn't one of high quality (also, not a lot of speakers around)."

The audio tour (included in admission) is one of the better tours. The rooftop is absolutely stunning. Then there's the insides where the audio guide gives you a lot of good interesting info about how Gaudi thinks about his buildings, plus facts on other works he's done. Although the entrance fee is not cheap, it was a great experience. Plan to spend 75 mins there."

Calle de Garcia is one of the main streets to walk along to see some of his famous creations. Walk from Placa Catalunya to Casa Batllo - fish scales and all , also look at Casa Amatller and Casa Lleo Morerea on the way, until you reach the Casa Mila - La Pedrera - which includes a Gaudi exhibition, an art collection and of course the rooftop viewing point. There are many other buildings to enthuse over least not the Sagrada Familia."

A self-defined atheist whose biggest proyect (yet to be finished) was financed by the catholic church sounds like pure madness but this is just one intriguing facet that defines Antoni Gaud\u00ed. This attraction is easily accesible by public transportation. Despite the fact this is a tourist attraction please keep in mind that this still a residential building (nit a museum) so bear that in mind when visiting La Pedrera."

It is 3 mins walk away from Casa Batllo, 5 mins away from the nearest Metro stop, Passeig de Gracia. The visit starts with an exhausting trundle up stairs all the way to the roof but you are rewarded with an amazing sight. The roof is fairly big, and frequent winds make you feel less oven-baked. Afterwards, you go down through the insides and out. The whole visit takes roughly 2 hours max. Nearby are also high-end stores, e.g. Luis Vuitton, Dior, Longchamp...

Gaudi is known for his curved lines & decorated chimneys & this structure is no exception.

The website is very well designed and informative (especially the video clips), the staff is very friendly and makes the premium ticket holders feel special.

You first visit the main courtyard and see the wavy exterior lines, the beautiful gate and painted vestibule, then you go to the roof to experience the surreal landscape created by Gaudi, who thought that the roof should be beautiful as well as functional, then down to the attic to learn some history of both the location and the architect, and finally you wrap up with a tour of an apartment as it would have looked at the time Gaudi built it. The audio-guide provides a good amount of interesting information without dragging on. All in all recommended and interesting.

There are amazing views of the city from up there and you even get a class of bubbly thrown in. Tips: get in first and find a good spot with a view of the stage.

His work seems to me to show a love of life through the use of colour, shape and form via the use of the building materials - you only have to visit Sagrada Familia, Casa Batiklo or Parc Guell. All of which are great fun and a joy to visitLa Pedrera is not really in the same league as the others in my opinion which of course is a personal perspective. This is one of the most expensive places we visited while in Barcelona. It was also extremely crowded. The visit is highly organised - first the roof, which is interesting but hardly his best, then down through an exhibition of his other great works held in the 270 curved brick arches of the attic. You then proceed to an reconstructed period apartment where there is not a single straight line in sight. You have to exit through a gift shop which is unexciting. Don't get me wrong Gaudi was a genius and this is an interesting building but not his best and not worth the high entrance fee."

You can tell she is a big fan of Gaudi's work, which is a plus, (not your bored tour guide just reciting their lines). We had a long day of walking around in the heat, so getting to the top and just sitting down and watching La Pedrera's mosaics and curves, and lines redesigned with lights was awesome. I have been to La Pedrera before in the day time, doing the full indoor tour. I recommend that, but if you don't have time, you can still get to see some of the inside, learn about Gaudi, and see what they can do with his sculptures atop the building.

The only good thing about the experience was that there was a very short line to get in, so at least we didn't spend a bunch of time waiting to buy tickets. The self-guided tour starts in the atrium which is nothing special, then you wait in line to take the elevator up to the roof. There are some pretty cool looking sculptures on the roof, and this is pretty much the highlight of the tour, but the building is in the middle of the city and there is no real view from the roof. Then you walk down to the attic which is filled with mini-models of various Gaudy buildings and is an absolute waste of time. Then you walk down to the apartment level which is set up the way someone may have lived here decades ago -- very unimpressive. Then your tour ends in the gift shop. DONE! I would NOT recommend spending your valuable vacation time and money in this very disappointing tourist trap. There is, however, a great Torrons Vicens candy shop outside of the building which is fantastic! Look at La Pedrera from the street, take some pictures, then spend your entry fee at Torrons Vicens.

We went later in the day and the crowds had died down and it was actually pleasant to walk through without the massive crowds we experienced at Casa Batillo. However some rude tourists were still occupying the roof, more interested in taking selfies than viewing this architectural masterpiece. This is a large building and be warned this is still a building in use, so it has active offices and apartments in it.The roof is by far the most interesting feature with stunning Barcelona views and those crazy chimneys. It's iconic Barcelona!There is one apartment that was set up as in earlier days and is a bit dull and uninteresting. The details of the walls, windows and floors are the interesting part of this visit.One tip - take the elevator up and down - it's worth it! The stairs are killer!Don't miss this Gaudi masterpiece!"

I visited Barcelona, Spain on Business and I was determined to see Antonio Gaudi\u2019s works in the city, so I stayed over another day to do just that.This review is for Casa Mila, also known as La Pedrera, located at: Calle Paseo de Gracia, 92, 08008 Barcelona, Spain. My hotel was just a kilometer or so from this very special building.La Pedrera was commissioned to be built and it took about 6 years from 1906 to 1912 to be completed. This very special building is almost two different building since there are two separate courtyards that the building surrounds. Each courtyard has a very unique shape. The result of this concept was to make the building shaped like an asymmetrical number \"8\" with these two open courtyards. I did get a chance to enter one courtyard during my visit.The most special parts of the building are the ornate wrought iron balconies and the roof. The wrought iron balconies are twisting, convoluted shapes and sizes of iron. It appeared to me that every single balcony was uniquely different. On the roof of this nine story/level building, there are many skylights and very modernistic shapes of chimneys, almost like a sculptured work of art. I did climb the stairs to the top to see the features on his roof.Antonio Gaudi loved to design with a passion using curves, rounded corners and asymmetry, very unlike most architects that used squares, rectangles, triangles and other similar shapes in their designs. Casa Mila lives up to his passion when he produced this work of art."

It is, however, quite different from Casa Battl\u00f3 which is only a few blocks down the street, both from its facade and its interior. La Pedrera is like a giant sculpture, a poem turned into stone, a poem made from stone itself, an emsemble of organic forms, a petrified wave. La Pedrera is also known as Casa Mil\u00e0, named after industrialist Pere Mil\u00e0, who commissioned the building as his family home. It became a UNESCO world heritage site in 1984. The visit will take you to the courtyards and staircases and up to the roof terrace with its many chimneys and ventilations shafts, all designed in various organic and original forms. The roof terrace offers great vistas of Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia and Barcelona. On the 4th floor you can visit an apartment recreating the home and lifestyle of a bourgeois family in the early 20th century, together with furniture and household items of the period. I can also recommend the museum shop (separate entrance on Passeig de Gracia), they have excellent books on Gaudi`s work in all the major languages."

Long queues were off putting so we paid the extra 7 euro and took the premium access option. It is amazing and the audio tour is high quality and really informative. Take the time to wander the roof top, explore the attic displays and wander the different rooms. Inspiring - it left us in awe of the creativity of the Gaudi master. So glad we did this before our Sagrada Familia tour - we all agreed La Pedrera was much more authentic and purely Gaudi. Don't miss going inside."

My friend wanted to come to this apartment block, I wasn't really too bothered about it - that's until we got there! I absolutely loved it. The design and layout of the building is fascinating. You have to walk around 8 flights of stairs to get where you need to be but its worth it once you get there, there is also a lift if you need to use this instead. There is a display in the attic of the building showing all of Gaudi's designs and how he built them. And then you go up to the roof which is absolutely beautiful. The walls stopping you falling over the edge aren't very high though and there is no safety railings so be careful and look where you are going, I personally wouldn't recommend bringing small children up. And then from this you go back downstairs to an apartment set out the way it would have been designed in the era it was made for. It is really interesting to go and look and definitely worth a visit. We went during the Easter Holidays later on in the afternoon and we only qued for around 10 minutes to go in, do not know what this would be like at other times though. You can also choose to visit here when it has gone dark and they turn all the lights on the roof which reflect off all the mosaics."

The entrance fee is quite expensive, but this fee does includes an audio guide and a tour of La Pedrera is quite an experience! The tour of the building is arranged in a way that you work your way back down from the courtyard decorated with the very special roof architecture to the gift shop that you can visit without buying tickets for the tour. When you climb the building's stairs to go see the temporary museum, don't forget to look up at the lovely colours and paintings decorating the ceiling. For me La Pedrera seems to embody many moods and styles and as you walk through the museum no doubt you'll understand what I mean. There is nothing quite like La Pedrera in the rest of the world (with each of Gaudi's designs but simultaneously recognisable but individually iconic) so if you're in Barcelona, make a trip to La Pedrera as part of your plans."

When I entered the rooftop \"all my expectations were shattered\" as it looked like an ordinary apartment Rooftop with a few architecture figures made out of which only 2 or 3 were good. Not at all impressing! Yes if you takes your camera shots at some angles it looks good otherwise its just ordinary.Then we come down by stairs where we can see the models of the structures made by Gaudi. If you are into arts and architecture you will like it, otherwise it will be okay, not so great!After this we went one floor down into the apartment of Gaudi where he lived and it was nothing but a rich man's personal living area and then the tour ends.

First indoor parking garage with a lift, first ensuite plumbing, first ecologically designed apartment block, and so on. The apartments in Casa Mila were intended to provide the owner with a reliable income, rented to other wealthy citizens of the period. Your visit to Casa Mila will take you into one of these stunning spaces where you can see how life must have been for the wealthy in that era. That is one experience you will get from your visit.You ascend immediately to the rooftop when you first enter La Pedrera. There you are immersed in Gaudi's creation of weird looking statues and uneven roof lines. Your free audio guide will keep you informed as to why and how all this comes about. Take your time. I took two hours for my tour and could easily have stayed longer, maybe in the restaurant contemplating what I had just seen.In the attic section of the tour you will learn about the how and why of Gaudi's creation. There are models and displays so sit down and pay attention if you want to get your money's worth.It is also worth paying extra for the skip-the-line option. This is a popular attraction and large groups are frequent."

The roof alone is worth a visit, as there are so many small pieces of brilliance waiting to be discovered, such as the archways that perfectly frame the various other historic buildings in the nearby area. The internal building itself was relatively interesting, traversing through the various rooms listening to the ambiance music through the headphones.

Think Strawberry Fields and interior journeys recommended by Aldous Huxley and Timothy Leary.What's amazing is that so many patrons were willing to indulge Gaudi's fertile imagination, commissioning and building whimsically complicated, fluid works which are sui generis.La Pedrera is one such example, a work of art that is quite unlike any other, still occupied by some of the families which have lived in this apartment building for decades.Gaudi has single-handedly made Barcelona synonymous with creative architecture, a well-deserved reputation. Many cities have Belle \u00c9poque charm, but none besides Barcelona have Gaudi. Nobody does Gaudi like Gaudi."

He was commissioned by Pere Mila a wealthy business to build their family home on the very prestigious Passeig de Grecia ave. Its rather unconventional appearance led to the name La Pedrera or stone quarry. It had a wrenching stone facade and wrought iron balconies. There are many innovations including no load bearing walls because the stone was self supporting. The tours are at night. After being taken through the inside including the attic you are led to the roof top for a very unique light show on the very modernist fixtures on the roof. After the light show you are taken back down stairs for a glass of cava. This was a very unique and fun experience that I recommend."

La Pedrera costs 20,50 euro (if you add the audio guide--which, in my opinion, is indispensable), but it is pure, completed Gaudi when he was at the height of his power as an architect. The apartment (with original furnishings) and roof top and attic are fascinating. We had no trouble just walking up and buying a ticket to enter, but at sometimes the wait is extensive. Tickets are available (with a specified entrance time) on line the OFFICIAL La Pedrera web site. In my opinion, you should avoid buying from a tour company because the site is easy to reach and the audio guide does a wonderful job of explaining everything about the building. As you tour the attic where models of the structure and furniture are on display, the audio guide will explain the ideas behind the innovations. The roof top is pure Gaudi and looks down on the central atrium which provides light to the apartments, making them delightful spaces. The apartment contains original furnishings and makes it very clear why there are still people living in the building enjoying truly unique places to live--there are no load-bearing walls inside the building; Gaudi wanted to be able to customize each apartment for the owners' needs. When visiting Barcelona, it may seem like \"There's just too much Gaudi and each is expensive, so why spend all that money to see 'weird' architecture?\" However, having now seen La Sagrada Familia, Palau Guell and La Pedrera (and Park Guell on a previous trip), my opinion is that it's worth spending the money--and I'm not a person who knows a lot about architecture or art, but I found each site fascinating and well worth the time and money."

I'm sure if you're a big fan of Gaudi, you could spend several hours here. It was disappointing to not be able to access the roof, and it didn't help viewing the open courtyard either. We ran into the same issue with the weather at the Sagrada Familia in the afternoon, as the towers were closed (they did automatically refund us the extra money).The rain was very light, but I'm guessing many of the other sites that have outside access may have closed them as well. It's probably a safety issue as the stairs might become slippery as visitors tracked water on them. We had purchased our tickets well in advance, but if you are buying yours a few days out, I would advise you to check the forecast and plan accordingly to avoid disappointment."

I arrived 20 mins before my scheduled time but they kindly allowed me to join an earlier time for which I was grateful. This night tour bypasses what can be seen during the day. A guide just gives initial explanations about Gaudi models and then takes you straight to the roof. The lights are stunning \u2013 it is an amazing light show \u2013 superb \u2013 which goes for about one hour, after which we went back downstairs for a glass of cava. Barcelona is so much about Gaudi, this tour (and visiting there in daytime) is highly recommended."

Gaudi paid attention to the tiniest details including door handles fashioned from clay by the press of the hand & turned into brass fitted ergonomic designs. They look decorative but are sheer genius, like everything else he did. Don't miss the art gallery just a few steps up from the foyer (at the end of your visit).

In the attic (part of the standard tour), are skeletal models and a unique mirror exhibit of parabolic arches which are key to Gaudi's designs. Spend a few minutes studying these, and you will appreciate the soaring heights pf the cathedral, supported by the rather thin columns. In addition, the Pedrera ground floor which is the ceiling of the underground carpark I think may use the same design principle as the roof of large arenas, including Madison Square Garden"

The attractions include the skylights, chimneys, fans and staircase exits. These structures on the roof remind me of a Doctor Who character, or is it the other way around. There is a large courtyard around which is the multilevel building. The usual Gaudi style curves, twisting cast iron balconies and undulating facade are present. It is remarkable how Gaudi and his associates made use of the relatively small urban space to construct this large open space building in early 20th century. Part of the apartments are open for visits showing some of the furniture and other household items of the time. A must visit."

The finale - a projected short display on the chimneys was absolutely beautiful and magical for all of us including our 6 year old grand daughter. Whole experience lasted about 50 minutes and finished with a glass of ok cava Disappointed that we didn't see more of the house and felt it was overpriced . The balancing factor was that our grand daughter had a free entry. Like all Gaudi buildings it was just an amazing place to visit."

We were lucky enough to be staying within easy walking distance of la Pedrera & as such were able to get there fairly early (10ish) when the queue was very short. Pre booking tickets is advisable, although there is still a queue inside for the audio guide, security and the small lift which takes you to the roof where the tour starts. We spent quite a while exploring the roof, then the attic where there are exhibits dedicated to each of Gaudi's masterpieces, followed by the apartment with its clever use of both light and space. I enjoyed the way his incorporation of nature into his work was demonstrated. The feature on the design of the chairs and door handles was a great example of his attention to detail - everything had a purpose.We enjoyed our visit, but for us Casa Batlo wins hands down. There was nothing to compare with the immediate impact of all its vivid colours and curved walls which will stay with us forever.( I could have lived there today quite happily.) The disadvantages - much longer queue & there is no direct access to the shop from the street. I only mention the latter as we had visited the house & purchased items in the shop previously & I wished to return to the shop ( which is much larger than at this site) . However paying 40plus euro for the privilege of more shopping wasn't an option!"

            "review": "Beautiful house. Casa Mil\u00e0, the other Gaudi\u2019s @UNESCO World Heritage Site is just a few blocks up from Casa Batllo. Also known as La Pedrera (which means The Quarry), Casa Mil\u00e0 is also the bigger among the two buildings and the one you see photographed more often. At least that\u2019s how I have perceived it based on the photographs I normally see of Barcelona. Judging from the crowd on the day of my visit, I would tend to agree.The lines at La Pedrera can be much longer, so I would definitely suggest booking ahead of time, and for EUR7 more, I highly suggest the La Pedrera Premium ticket. You get to skip the line, get the quick lift ride up to the roof without waiting, and you\u2019ll also receive a visual guidebook of La Pedrera. Pretty good value in my opinion.The tour of Casa Mil\u00e0 begins at the roof. If you are a premium ticket holder, you take a separate lift and exit right into a beautiful rooftop view. I\u2019ve never seen such a meticulously designed roof terrace that resembles more of a work of art than a typical rooftop.Just like Casa Batllo, Casa Mil\u00e0 was built as somebody\u2019s residence, the Mil\u00e0 residence to be precise. Can you imagine coming home to such an interesting home, walk up to the roof and enjoy the evening sunset while having a glass of the best Spanish wine?As you walk along the path of the roof, you\u2019ll often time pass archways. Look closely and you\u2019ll see that Gaudi, a religious man has framed the archway to focus on 2 of God\u2019s house: the basilica on Mount Tibidabo, and one towards one of his own design - the Sagrada Familia.The roof features uniquely constructed chimneys in a few groupings around the terrace, resembling guardians that watch over the residents of the house. Staring enough at it, they kinda look like Optimus Primes. Paying close attention to these fellas is actually quite fun. They look the same, but are somewhat different still.The rooftop follows a path around the hole in the middle that brings light into the inner courtyard. Around the terrace, there\u2019s a few things I found interesting:1. The Knights of course.2. The view of Barcelona towards different directions, including views of the Mont Tibidabo, over Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia and its surrounding areas.3. Seeing visitors jostle for the perfect photo opportunity with the knights.4. I also took note that this is actually quite a modern building, the most modern in its day. There was a lift built in, and it goes to the first underground car park in Barcelona. Progressive!I think I came to Casa Mil\u00e0 at the best moment of the day, just before sunset so you can still enjoy Gaudi\u2019s work of art in daylight and stay awhile to see the changing light of the sun changes the colour of the courtyard.I love how the light glimmers at sun set. As twilight approaches, the roof baths in a golden glow that really showcase the majesty of Gaudi\u2019s design.While the roof itself provide most of the awe of Casa Mil\u00e0, the rest of the building is a dedicated museum to the building and to the life of Gaudi. There\u2019s an exhibition of Gaudi\u2019s constructions on the loft level, reconstructions of whole apartments inside the Casa Mil\u00e0, remodelled after the glory days of the building\u2019s origins. Walking down level by level, I felt like I\u2019m moving through time. If there was less people on the visit with me, I can truly imagine myself back in the early 1900s. It would also be nice if my apartment was just right here, perhaps on the 2nd floor."

We visited la Pedrera (the quarry) and casa batlo. I would recommend you try and take in both as they are both incredible. We booked online to avoid the queues but to be honest when we turned up the queue was tiny anyway. After picking up your headset audio guide you enter the atrium which is just incredible. It's as if you're transported from the hustle and bustle outside into a waiting area for tenants!The lift takes you to the roof which boasts beautiful scenic views over the city. The architecture, divine. We spent nearly an hour on the roof just taking it all in. The visit then takes your down to the loft where you can learn about gaudi's design methods. Surprisingly interesting. Finally you go downstairs to a recreated 1900's apartment. That part of the tour was very educational and fun especially as they'd taken great care to restore the old furniture. Great site."

Then one more flight to the rooftop where the sound and light show was held. Images were poorly projected on the rooftop chimneys and structures, and had nothing to do with Gaudi or his works.

The visit ends with a fantastic night light show at the terrace (see the pictures) - amazing to experience the Casa at night.Ends off with a glass of bubbly cava or juice (your choice) with a group of 15~20 visitors Had a wonderful time and the tour guide was very personable and knowledgeable, definitely exceed my expectations.Summer sun sets around 8.30-9.00pm, so that's when the Casa transforms with all the lighting, consider that when pre-booking a specific time."

The ventilation ducts were amazing for their purpose as well as for the construction on the roof on which the illuminations were displayed. My husband was able to use the lifts as he has mobility issues, but he chose to not venture too far along the roof spaces. I stayed to the center myself as I have a fear of heights.

The roof does not have particularly good views -- mostly scenes of air conditioning condensers -- and the uneven steps make moving around up there arduous. (And note: if you are at all uneasy about heights, you'll absolutely hate the roof!) The apartment is not especially beautiful, even if it is entirely authentic to upper middle class living in 1910; you'll find no gorgeous staircases, ceilings, or architectural details. The attic, though, is fantastic -- like walking though an undulating whale skeleton. The courtyard, too, is beautiful with unexpected murals. All in all, worth the high entrance fee, if not entirely as you'd expect. Note: I went on a Thursday at 3:00 in the afternoon -- no line at all!"

The apartments were for self use as well as to rent out. The design was inspired by different aspects of nature but is well thought out and functional to gain maximum space and light into the apartments. Even now the building is multi-use, I.e. not all of it is used as a museum despite it being World Heritage listed. Access to the roof is via the lift - The roof is a key highlight and you realise how well Gaudi planned every archway. Although the chimneys look like Knights, they are functional and truly beautiful. Check the weather before you go as the roof may not be accessible on a rainy day. The interior is also grand full of fluid and organic features mixed with art nouveau."

The audioguide was also very helpful. However, the rooftop really did me in. As beautiful as the terrace and view were, the terrace steps were difficult to manage, the railings seemed insubstantial, and the crowds did not allow for easy navigation. Purchasing tickets online was very easy and very helpful. We highly recommend this tour."

An art history professor friend of mine feels strongly that La Pedrera (Casa Mila`) provides a better understanding of Gaudi's vision than some of the other architectural wonders of Barcelona. Having also visited the breathtaking Sagrada Familia and the jewel Casa Battlo, I tend to agree with her. Gaudi designed La Pedrera from nothing and it was completed in his era (whereas the struture of Battlo existed before Gaudi and obviously Sagrada Familia is yet to be completed).I didn't prepurchase tickets for La Pedrera. I worried this would be a problem but upon arrival, there was hardly any wait at all. If the line for the elevator is long, take the stairs up 8 flights to the attic and the roof. On the roof, you encounter these other worldly statues and one of a kind views of Sagrada Familia in the distance and the Eixample district. The parabola covered attic is worth an extensive visit, explaining Gaudi's and his masterpieces. I loved the interiors, perhaps even more than Casa Battlo. Gaudi demonstrates a remarkable understanding of how to capture light and how to combine form with function."

So if you can, pre-buy a ticket online. We went up to the roof with the audio headsets and learned all about the structures and reasons for each. He really was brilliant! After you are finished on the roof, you come down to the attic and learn much more about Gaudi the man, the architect, his approach to architecture. His love of nature is reflected in everything he does. down another floor you see an apartment furnished for the era. Apartments on lower floors are actually being lived in.

This building really shows you what a creative architect Gaudi was - the building has underground parking and was designed before many people had cars. The apartment is very livable by today's standards. The attic is really interesting with its brick arches and open spaces. And you'll take a gillion photos on the roof.

The queues are long so I would advice booking on-line in advance. Leave yourselves at least 1.5 hours (minimum) for the tour. The tour of the roof top and the apartment and the attic is via an audio guide which was part of the guide. I think it is essential. I saw some people wandering round without it but they will have missed so much. It is truly an amazing feat of architecture. The evening event is quite pricey for what you get but it is a one off. You get a bit more of a tour with a guide and a short but quite impressive light show on the roof with projections of the creation of the world and the links between natures and Gaudi's work - it is quite clever. And you get a glass of Cava at the end. You are not rushed and the group we were in was quite small so we did not feel squashed. Overall, the building was definitely worth it and the evening event added a little something extra."

It appears to be less fabulous than the \"Gaudier\" Casa Batllo, but it if you are interested in Gaudi or enjoyed touring the latter home, you should not miss Casa Mila, a/k/a La Pedrera. It is an extraordinary building, as fascinating as can be, with wonderful, lucid demonstrations of some of Gaudi's innovative techniques. First, save a few hours by booking your tour of the inside ahead of time. It cost 20.50 Euros. I did it on my smartphone, and was modestly concerned (I'm in my 60s) about whether the scan of my phone would work for the entry as I did not have access to a printer, but it worked like a charm. The entry is on the side street. Second, get the included audio headset, but check it before you get going, the headphone wires tended to have shorts in them, which was annoying. (Don't worry about starting the tape while you are downstairs in the entry. You can always press stop and start again when you get to the appropriate room.) Now, enjoy this fantastic architecture and museum. Gaudi's conception of ergonomics over a hundred years ago, is extraordinary, and it is explained in detail here. I listened to and looked at everything, as well as spending time in the store, so I spent about 2-3 hours here. If you haven't already seen Casa Batllo, plan your day, and get the timed ticket for it the same day. It cost 27.50 Euros. It's another wonderful, and quite different, Gaudi building 4 blocks away and across the street on Passeig de Gracia in the opposite direction from Avinguda Diagonal. If you have time to kill, and want a little taste of home, there's a Starbucks diagonally across Passeig de Gracia (same side as Casa Batllo), just before you get to Av. Diagonal."

I won't try to describe what it's like because to do that you'd have to compare it with somewhere else and there isn't anywhere else like it!! What you will do is find you keep shaking your head from side to side in disbelief and wonderment as every element of Casa Mila launches itself at you. From the rooftop architecture to the apartment, the attic, the list goes on, EVERYTHING Gaudi did was something mere mortals wouldn't and couldn't conceive of. His mind must have been made from different materials to ours! When you realise just how long Casa Mila has been there, and how revolutionary it was ( and still is now ) in design, you have to wonder if Gaudi was from a parallel universe.I can't do Casa Mila justice writing about it..... Honestly, just get yourself over to it and strap your jaw shut so it doesn't hit the floor when you see the place!!!"

I'm not an architectural fan but the combination of the flights of fantasy combined with pure practicalities melt me into admiration. Did you know Gaudi made handles for doors and drawers by getting people to squeeze clay and then taking impressions...so the handles fit your fingers and make using them so easy! The visitor space is really well set out, you have a choice of lift or stairs up to the roof terrace and then wander your way though the attic, into a show apartment which illustrates perfectly how people, owners and servants lived, before coming back down into the courtyard. I made the mistake of exiting into the shop before using the loo - once you're in the shop, you can't get back into the fee-paying area so bear that in mind. Another one to get to early - we walked in at approx 10am and were able to get tickets for immediate entry and enjoy the terrace without being crowded but there was a queue for entry when we left."

Although the sign said they closed the roof on rainy days and it was raining we were still able to walk on the roof. This was the star of our visit and an absolute must-see - I don't know if they reduce the entrance fee if the rooftop is out of bounds but if not then it would not be worth it.We really enjoyed walking on the roof and admiring the many structures with which Gaudi adorned the top of the building even if it was too misty to see the way the archways frame other Barcelona attractions.The vaulted attic has an extensive display of models, photos and artefacts explaining Gaudi's technique. And the other main attraction is the apartment with period furniture that gives you an insight into both the period and the inside of the building - there are no straight lines.I have admired the Gaudi houses from the outside on many occasions but never visited the inside of any.

Windows and doors remind grottoes.For its uniqueness, artistic and heritage value, it has received major recognition and in 1984 was inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List, for its exceptional universal value.Nowadays it is the headquarters of Catalunya-La Pedrera Foundation and houses a cultural centre that is a reference point in Barcelona for the range of activities it organises, and the different spaces for exhibitions and other public uses it contains.Remarkable features of this unusual, fairy-tale-like house contain a curved, \"wave-like\" stone facade, twisted wrought-iron-decorations, a lack of right angles and a preference for naturalistic rather than geometric forms.

We went at a time when my health wasn't 100% and so paid the extra few euros to have the Premium Entry to the site, which was really well worthwhile. No queuing involved whatsoever -- we by-passed the queue just by paying a little extra. We went straight up to the roof in the elevator, as we were excited to see the wonderful chimneys and doorways and statues up there. It is without question Gaudi per excellence. Once up there under a blue Barcelona sky, with a gentle breeze blowing, it is so easy to let your imagination run wild, and make your own interpretation of the wonderful works of art surrounding you. It is absolutely fascinating -- how on earth did Gaudi have such a fantastic imagination . . . and, even more, how was he able to turn it all into being? Both my husband and I absolutely loved it. I could have spent hours up there. The rest of the house,and the fascinating courtyards, are very interesting, with special exhibits and lots of explanations about how Gaudi worked, and how his wonderful buildings came into being . . . . but the roof-top is the prize!!! I would go there again in a flash!"

The audio guide was concentrating more on the work of Gaudi in general rather than his work on La Pedrera instead. The roof was really a work of art! However, I would not recommend it for people who have any kind of difficulty with their legs, asyou have to go up and down quite many steps of stairs."

La Pedrera - Casa Mila worths the effort to arrive there (although I wouldn`t call it an effort because it`s located in a central area). We didn`t visited inside the building but from outside it`s a perfect place to admire by any architecture lover."

We were advised by a very helpful museum staffer to come back later in the day because the rooftop was closed because of the rain and we should not miss it. She was right! The rooftop is undescribable. It undulates between the disguised chimneys and other rooftop structures, affording amazing views of the city and Gaudi's masterpiece Sagrada Familia. One floor down, in the attic, the arches holding up the roofline are reminiscent of a dragon's rib cage, dipping up and down with the roofline. One restored apartment on the floor below was a delight. There are no straight lines here. But there is plenty of light and space. Don't miss this on your trip to Barcelona."

Once we were inside the building we were ushered into a courtyard and shown the amazing Gaudi architecture, all wavy and curved edges etc. But I felt quite claustrophobic in there maybe it was the colours in the hall (green/brown/blue) - its quite a dark building inside. We waited in queues for ages and I was not sure why we were waiting - but this was to go up onto the roof terrace for the views. Quite interesting but not worth the wait in the queue. The roof terrace was quite difficult to walk on with lots of steps onto different levels so not my cup of tea. We then had a tour of two separate apartments (large rooms, light and airy - that was interesting) but otherwise would probably not go again, sorry."

La Pedrera offers a complete look into the mind of Gaudi and allows visitors to connect with his design styles. It provides an excellent opportunity to learn about his design philosophy and see it implemented before your eyes. We recommend the first entrance of the day, as it gets busy with tour groups, including student groups, as the morning wears on. There is a very nice souvenir shop within La Pedrera that is reasonably priced, considering the location."

We enjoyed the tour of the apartment, a small one in fact, with some nice modernist furniture. We were rather disturbed by behavior of over excited families, sitting on chairs and touching everything. There was no guards in site and when I asked about it, one of the guides told me that they had slashed security staff.This is the place to protect and respect."

They have an excellent very comprehensive display in the attic where you can spend as little or as much time as you want, same as the rooftop.

It is amazing to think this building is actually an apartment block built round 2 or 3 courtyards, many of the apartments are currently homes, although some are offices. There is a 'show' apartment, which you can wander through and is furnish just as it was when it was built, in fact it is quite large with many rooms.The outside of the building is very ornate and this continues inside but the most interesting 'chimneys' and other structures are to be found on the roof terrace. They are amazing. The terrace is not flat but has several levels with great views over Barcelona. It is possible to visit at night when it is illuminated but I believe numbers are limited.Admission includes audio guides, which is much better than having to read descriptive notices on your way round, so you don't miss anything. It is best if you can purchase your tickets on-line before you get there, as there can be quite long queues to get in.There is strict security checks similar to airport ones and certain things may be taken from you and returned on your exit."

Cannot imagine what they pay. There's a gallery in one section and while nice & filled with photography on people from all over the world, I found it a bit random & didn't at all see how it tied in to Gaudi or the rest of this beautiful structure. The rooftop view was pretty, sculptures up there are certainly worth viewing. In my opinion, this isn't a must do, but can be done if a true architecture/art/Gaudi lover."

Atmosphere was amazing...to have the whole Casa Mila to ourselves was perfect. I'm told it's a totally different experience throughout the day but still worth going!

Out side you could tell the interior would be something else, and it didn't disappoint! Its worth getting the tickets before hand to jump the queue and walk straight in, if you cant print off the tickets, they will scan your smart phone. Anyway in, and pick up your audio guide; personally I don't like walking around listening to someone blabbing in my ear and having to know where I am just to press the relevant number. Up to the roof and the weirdness of your surrounds, just walk around and appreciate it. Its cool. If you want to take pictures you may have to wait until the crowd disperses from that specific shot; with the amount of steps both up and down on the roof why do people stand on a step and not move? The floor below is the apartment and have a slow walk round. You will walk slow as the slithering snake like mass of people wont allow you to go any faster, I ended up just putting my camera into each room (in between the crush of tourists) and hoped what I caught was indicative of what others saw. Maybe being a bit harsh but as I said at the start sight-seeing is not my preferred vacation. But really glad I went! Bet you do too!!

When we first did this about 4 yrs ago we had one of the most amazing experiences with a friendly approachable tour guide and amazing intimate experience. This time we brought my mother-in-law and we were one of 30 people at night tour (last time we were one of 6 people) and this time we had hard time hearing our tour guide (they should give us all audio guides in our native tongues) and we noticed a lot had changed. We started at bottom and immediately were whisked to top level and terrace and that was it. Last time we went through multiple levels and felt the experience was intimate. This time we felt like a number (and expensive at that as this wasnt cheap).If you havent done this do it but do cheaper day tour and dont pay extra for night tour as nothing special as it feels like they just want to turn over people and make $$$"

I think you need to combine the day and the night tour. The night tour feels rushed and you don't really get time to experience the building. You enter the front door, watch a projector show then climb up to the attic for more of a tour then watch a light show with sound on the roof which displays on the roof sculptures. You don't have enough time to explore the exhibits in the attic which is why I feel you should get the day tickets too.We booked the joint meal/night time tour tickets. As an aside, the meal isn't worth it. They rush you through your 4 course meal literally giving you your next dish as soon as they clear your previous one. I felt like I was a force fed goose pre liver extraction. You'd be better off eating a meal elsewhere. My companion asked for the cod and it was like eating a tasteless rubber duck. The service was unfriendly too. Definitely a tourist trap experience. Casa Mila - 4 starsCaf\u00e9 de la Pedrera - 2 starsSo my recommendations are go for the joint day/night tour and skip the cafe meal all together."

We chose to visit la pedrera since it is one of the homes designed by Gaudi that features rooms and furnishings similar to how it would have been when Gaudi first designed it. The whole experience was great. We booked our ticket online before hand (no need to print tickets. They accept mobile tickets). I highly recommend purchasing tickets beforehand as the line up when we got there was at least 30 mins long. Inside you are given a handset that offers further explanations of the features of the home. You basically guide yourself around the building. It took us about 2 hours for the tour and we did not rush ourselves. The building is used for offices so the museum part is on the top floor. You are taken by elevator up to the roof first. And then you take stairs down to the museum (attic level) and then further down to the living quarters. Then all the way down to the ground floor. Total of about 6 flights of stairs down. But not strenuous by any means. The view from the roof was fantastic. It was a bit crowded. And had lots of art students sitting around doing sketches. Which prevented us from walking around the whole thing. It would be nice if they were told to move after a certain amount of time to allow everyone a chance to explore. Overall though it was a good experience. The handset tour was very educational and did a good job pointing out the various features of the building. The furnished home was also very interesting and you really do get a sense of how the building would have functioned back then. The area la pedrera is in is also very nice and worth a walk around to just look at all the various architecture."

You spend time in the lobby, the attic exhibition and on the roof where there is a light show to music projected against the stair turret depicting Gaudies inspirations. In all honesty it is a little Disney but it is well done and my team age companion enjoyed it emencly and it was great to see the roof in such a small group. Note that on this toor you do not get to see inside the apartment but you can pay an additional 5 euros to come back during the day to do thisA word of caution - there are warnings all over Barcelona about the proliferation of pick pockets and it was while I was here during the day that I had my purse stolen so take extra care and be ware of people constantly blocking your way and bumping into you on the narrow steps on the roof"

That way you can see the contrast with an amazing light show of the statues on the roof. The tour also includes the attic where there's a museum, followed by a tour of a house with old furnishings of the time. There's people residing in the building so we were told not to go knock on people's doors when we were in the stairwell. I wonder how much rent is there."

At night, after dark, the second part of the experience also includes a tour, literally topped off by a light show on the roof. Lasers play off the sculptures on the roof deck, telling a story.

We walked from the Gothic quater up to Pedrera so saw an awful lot along the way. By the time we arrived at the undulating building there were queues, however we waited no more than twenty minutes and then we were through with our inclusive audio guides. La Pedrea was Gaudi's vision of urban living the house a series of apartments. The forms and textures are exquisite, the rooms dressed much as the original family might have left them. From the vaulted hall you are sent to the lift which takes you skyward to the most impressive roof affording you a breathtaking skyline. A word of warning, for those with no head for heights the roof can induce vertigo, the steps lead you to think you could plummet to earth. The chimneys are almost like chess pieces, strange figures when seen from ground level but on the roof it all makes sense, they belong there covering the functionality of the space. The attic explains in detail aspects of Gaudi's work and other projects situated around Barcelona and you can take as much time as you wish. Of course as you come down the floors to the exit there is the obligatory walk through the museum shop but here there are some interesting items. You can pay extra to visit at night when the building is lit up."

The lines of the building are beautiful--Gaudi's imagination was amazing.The ventilation system on the roof is Star War-esque and it just made me smile. The flow through the building was a little confusing, but there was staff there to let you know where to go next. You needed to really pay attention to see the numbers for the audio guide so keep your eyes open. There was a section where you learned about how Gaudi did his designs, and it was really interesting.

I looked at the board outside which advertised an English guided tour in about ten minutes. With nothing else to do I headed over to the \"box office\" to buy a ticket.I went to the box office and handed over 34, yes that's 34, euros for a ticket and joined the back of the waiting queue.You go into an inner open air courtyard and the guide gives a talk about the history of the building and you see a short film.You then have a choice of either stairs or a lift to take you up to the attic. After climbing up about a million stairs you get into the attic.In the attic you can really see Gaudi's design and the architecture is very impressive. There are also models and some Gaudi designed chairs. The guide gives a detailed talk.You then go up onto the roof where the real magic happens. The guide excused herself and said that a colleague would be up later to show us the way down. You are then treated to a fairly impressive light and sound show that is beamed onto the tops of the stairwells. To me this was the highlight of the tour and I am glad I seen it, even if it did cost 34 euros.After the show finished, there was no one to show you the way down and we sort of wondered around aimlessly until we found a staircase.At the bottom you exit the stairwell into a second courtyard where you are served refreshments and given time to reflect on the tour.Overall I enjoyed the tour but thought it was a bit expensive at 34 euros and should be a maximum of 20."

The only Gaudi attraction we saw that was more amazing then Casa Mila (the original name for La Pedrera) was Sagrada Familia.There are 2 options when touring Casa Mila: La Pedrera by Day or The Origins (a night tour). We did both and I definitely suggest both. During the day you can stroll and your leisure and really look at everything (the best parts being The Attic and the rooftop). The evening tour is an actual tour which we were happily surprised by. You get to find out a lot of interesting things about Casa Mila this way and it ends with a light show on the roof."

La Pedrera does not blow you away like Casa Batllo - although the roof is definitely the piece de resistance of this Gaudi house! But it's still well worth visiting because of the extensive exhibition on Gaudi & his architectural style in the attic, and the rooms below high are decorated & furnished as they were originally in the early 20th century - from the children's room with their 1900s style toys, to the kitchen equipped exactly as it would have been and the study with a very, very old original typewriter & the original phonogram in the sitting room!"

Nevertheless, we enjoyed the visit, bought a few things in the two gift shops, and then enjoyed La Pedrera Cafe just as much after the tour (it's quite nice and very reasonable - approximately 12 euros for three coffees and a cream catalana cheesecake, all in a beautiful setting). So, enjoy one of Gaudi's landmark works. You can't fail but be impressed with his genius."

The audio tour is great, but I actually found myself ignoring it in favour of imagining for myself what it might be like to live there. Even the staircases between floors are beautiful - a glorious insight into the mind of a genius.One note to the operators; please, for the love of GOD, ban selfie-sticks from the venue. They get in normal peoples' way and detract from other peoples' enjoyment of the space. If these sycophants can't manage to go 2 metres without taking a picture of themselves, they shouldn't be allowed in.

His inspiration was drawn from nature, from massive rock formations and animals from before the dawn of civilisation and the creation of fantasy warriors, extra-terrestrial fantasy figures on the roof. The roof is amazing. A collection of bizarre but functioning sculpted artefacts, some statues, others chimneys. Some of mosaics and others of sandstone.

When we got there quite early on a Monday morning there was no queue and it was quiet inside. You start your tour (with audio guide) on the roof which is interesting with good views out. Then down to the attic floor where there is an exhibition on Guadis work, you then go down to a pretty grand apartment which is furnished in the period of the building. Last stop is down at the bottom of the central courtyard which has lots of very pretty mosaic tiling and a view up the centre of the building."

We spent 20 euros to see the interior, the rooftop and an example of an earlier period apartment. It was interesting, but not as good as other attractions we visited. You can buy your tickets in advance, but we purchased ours just before our visit. The line to purchase tickets was not very long. Next door to La Pedrera is Vicens, a shop featuring traditional Barcelona candy. It was a beautiful store with many samples of its products and well worth a visit to purchase gifts for friends at home. Would rate Vicens with five stars."

And it was worth it! The rooftop is a paradise on a sunny day and we could spend hours on it, in its mythical atmosphere...I can imagine it will be amazing during the nightly light shows!

I went for the Gaudi's Pedrera: The Origins tour, which is a guided tour at night and includes a light show on the roof. I really enjoyed the tour, although I think a day time visit in which you may be able to see more of the villa, might add more, however I am not entirely sure as I haven\u2019t done that. The Pedrera is a beautiful, strange place and inspires awe for Gaudi. Truly nothing is straight, which is typical of his style, and it is amazing to see that this has been executed in every teeny tiny detail. During the tour you start downstairs in the courtyard where you receive an explanation and a short video that is projected on the floor. That video was a bit overkill in my opinion, as it was not very clear and did not add that much as it was a repetition of what the guide had already told us. Then you are taken up to the attic by the stairs (it\u2019s a lot of stairs!) or elevator, where you get a good look of the \u201cwhale\u201d arches with a very thorough and interesting explanation. After this you continue to the roof, where there is a nice light show, although I would have appreciated it more if the light show had incorporated more in relation to Gaudi. It is fun to see an aquarium displayed on some of the towers, however I have seen things like that before. Once the light show is finished you can roam around on the roof for a little bit and actually get a very nice view of Barcelona. Then you are taken down to a reception room for a glass of cava. This room is of course also designed by Gaudi and it is fun to see the extreme attention to detail. You can furthermore go down a beautiful staircase after which the tour is finished. I liked it, but would probably advise you to go and do a guided tour during the day."

While you can see La Pedrera freely from outside, waht is really worth to see is th inside (roof, attic and the top level apartments plus a courtyard and staircases). The visit is somewhat overpriced (20,50 Euro for a day visit) however an audioguide is included in the price (Polish not available). Gaudi's unique approach to architecture is well presented here.What was an extremally negative experience during the visit was a service. We reached the counter about 2 hours before closure. As someone already mentioned it, the audioguide description itself is about 1,5h which means only 0,5 hour left for leisury walking around and admiring the details, exhibition (that provides another 10 minutes or so of video materials). There's no warning about that, nor any information how long is the audioguide. While I believe there are many people, who go to a tourist attraction only to quickly go through that and 0,5h is enough for such people for a whole visit, we wan't to fully use what we've paid for. In this case there was no chance for it. It was impossible to listen to full audioguide descriptions, not to mention fully enjoying everything that can be enjoyed there. As a result we were rushed out of the building (oh sorry - to the store on the ground floor) before we really had time to benefit from the visit. We really felt cheated.Except that my rating would probably go up to Very Good... But the service ruined the visit."

Get to the building first thing in the morning to avoid long lines. The tour and experience are second to none. Architecturally it is structurally innovative with a self supporting stone front and columns and the floor plates are free of load bearing interior many columns and walls. At the of the building is a fascinating museum of Gaudi furniture, structural innovations, etc. There are two magnificent interior courtyards that allow light and air to penetrate all the way to the ground level that are wonderfully articulated and detailed. This is one of the first buildings (1906) that included a car park in the basement, accessible by curving ramps. There is not a single straight line in the building anywhere. it is still private residences on many of the lower floors. Go online to look at photos of the roofs caps of staircases, ventilation towers and chimney tops of this building. It is something that you won't forget. By virtue of its spectacular facade and its unique roof terrace , la Pedrera is considered one of the most extraordinary buildings of the 20th century."

Gaud\u00ed's work is unique, but even considering that, the lines and shapes of the roof are extraordinary and great to see in person. (You even feel them walking up and down the steps scattered throughout.) Even the arches in the attic are pleasing to the eye. It's nice being able to walk through the apartment--although many rooms are set up as they would have been when the building was built, it would have been nice to see more details and rooms (like the kitchen) set up that way. Overall, a worthy visit for fans of Gaud\u00ed. Purchase tickets in advance -- you can buy them online easily, and your wait to get in will be much shorter."

Well worth the additional cost as you get priority access, with NO waiting in line, we were led straight to the lift and this allowed us to cut at least 40min in the entrance line (wait for tickets and then entry). You get the audioguide thrown in, and this is not to be missed as it is one of the best ways to understand Gaudi and the times. Once in you are on the top floor you are mixing with the normal entrance folk, but this is not a problem as the numbers are controlled so it is not overcrowded. We followed the guide and really got a lot more out of the visit, it does take longer as you become enthralled with the details rather than ticking off the rooms and without the long wait you are still fresh and eager."

In my opinion, it's organic feel marries in quite well with some of the forms of architecture happening around us all today!

Casa Mil\u00e0 now known as La Pedrera was designed and built for a single family who at times did not agree with Gaudi about the design and function but the result is very unique, beautiful, and worth a visit. We originally booked a night tour but had to cancel due to our flight being canceled at the last minute. Thanks Air France. We were however able to visit the following evening during regular hours and were happy that we did. The tour of the building was impressive but I found the attic space to be the most interesting in that it was shaped like the rib cage of a snake and packed with displays on how Gaudi borrows the shapes of nature and uses Funicular geometric hanging 3D models to design his buildings. The coffee shop in front was also a nice place to relax and have a snack."

The next stop is the attic, which includes wonderful models and information about Gaud\u00ed and his work. The attic itself is a wonderful space to spend time in. From there, you proceed to the 4th floor, where one of the original apartments has been preserved & furnished with period pieces. It's great fun to imagine this as your home in Barcelona, surrounded with Gaud\u00ed's unique style of design. We were fortunate to be there in the off-season so it was easy to wander back & forth in the apartment to get a good feel of what it was like to live there. The other apartment on the 4th floor has been converted to a gift shop and public toilets. There is also a gift shop on the main level as well as a restaurant that is open to the public.

This is a beautiful house, we definitely recommend seeing it!We did not book tickets in advance and, in December, were looking at a line about 30 minutes long. There are 3 ticket options available: daytime ticket, nightime ticket, combination day/night (discounted). We did the combo so we could see the light show at night. For the nighttime visit you have to choose a very specific time to arrive.We had a baby stroller & backpack--checked in both in the locker room. Lockers are for rent, requires coins.There are lots of stairs, not able to use a stroller at all but we had our baby sling with us (thankfully). There is an elevator for going from the first floor directly to the roof; or you can walk the stairs. Then you walk the rest of the way down (this is what staff told me when I asked about taking an elevator back down--no in between floor stops). The roof is quite large, uneven, and lots of stairs. Spectacular views. In December at noon the roof was SO hot & sunny. We were stripping off our jackets & hats & gloves. Wish I had an umbrella for shade & my sunglasses.The house itself has a lot of windows that let in light and heat--it was quite warm walking around. In hindsight, we should have left our jackets/hats/gloves in the locker room.I saw two public bathrooms while walking through the house. I also saw vending machines and some tables/chairs to have a snack at (we had our own snacks/water).Daytime entry is on your own, at your own pace.Our nighttime visit was for 2000 (8 pm) and we were about 3-4 minutes late. Fortunately they let us join anyways. If you get a night time ticket, it is for a guided tour that lasts about an hour. When we asked about dropping off the stroller in the locker room he said no because it would 'hold up everyone else' (the locker room was only about 40 feet away) so we had to take it with us. Fortunately it is a smaller one that folds up. He took us through the house for about 40 minutes before going to the roof for the light show. It was more of a movie; lasted about 15 minutes. Then you take the stairs all the way down & they served us champagne, orange juice, & some little desserts. No bathroom stops or additional stops on this tour--the guide has a timeframe to complete the tour & he does not stray from it."

Inside, when visiting the rooms, furnished as in the 1930s, you'll need to stay in front (or behind) of the herd and get your photos quickly for a clean shot. Between the roof and the apartment rooms is a loft with architectural models and audio visual displays showing Barcelona in Gaudi's time. You can rent audio guides at the entrance. We took the elevator to the roof ( some stairs involved too) and worked our way back down. You exit through a spacious gift shop and Cafe Pedrera has tables on the sidewalk to decompress and enjoy the buskers who stroll by.Hopefully my photos will give you a good idea of what to expect...."

We were wrong and happy to have gone to see the light show on the roof of the house. If anything, Gaudi was extremely detail-oriented. When he remodeled the house, he intended to extend his art to the attic and roof, areas seldomly accessed by the rich owners that were paying for the renovations. As a result, the Mila family did not want to pay for the roofwork where ventilation shafts where disguised as eerie storm troopers or robot like statues. Fortunately, enough of the work was completed to create a fantasy world. The attic looks like the inside of a massive Leviathan and the light show at night from the roof is not to be missed. An opportunity to drink a little Cava sparkling wine at the end on the ground floor give a nice finishing touch to the visit."

We came around 4:30 PM on a Sunday afternoon, no wait for purchasing tickets or anything during this December month. However, I am glad we came at this time because the first stop on the audio guided tour was to the rooftop of La Pedrera. We spent maybe 20 minutes up at the rooftop taking pictures of the chimneys and of the surrounding areas during sunset. It was absolutely spectacular. You'll be able to see the church at the top of Tibidabo, the Mediterranean Sea, and the La Segrada Familia.You'll then go and explore the buildings of La Pedrera of what used to be an attic and a typical apartment building. You'll also see models of all of Gaudi's work at La Pedrera such as the planning/models for Park Guell, Casa Batllo, etc which was extremely informative information that I didn't get at these other sites. What's also unique is that La Pedrera is also a World Heritage Site.Overall, highly recommended and a must during the visit to Barcelona. Come during sunset if you can!"

To go to the rooftop of the building, we had to use an elevator and then climb some steps to reach the top. The rooftop had a lot of interesting chimney structures. There are a lot short steps that goes up and down throughout the rooftop. As you go through the building, there is a photographer that will ask if you want a picture in front of the green screen. We had our picture taken and it was beautiful. They placed the La Pedrera in the background. They showed you the pics and you can choose to buy it or not.

First he broke a set of rules for the building in the squares of the new Expansion(Eixample) District:The building was to be build at a straight angleIt wasn't supposed to be this highThe roof was not supposed to have the nice ventilation and Starship troopers shaped chimneys.It was revolutionary, the facade didn't have a supporting role, this was done by the columns that were incorporated in the building, it had interchangeable walls since the walls didn't act as weigh bearing structures.the ground Floor was inhabited by the Millas , they had a monumental staircase and the rest of the building designed for the tenants(now the rent is 16000 euros and a big waiting list) had an elevator.The Millas which commisioned Gaudi didn't like the building, and because of his extravagant style he piled up a set of fines for not taken into account the rules for building, they decided to pay Gaudi less than previously agreed(The Name Pedrera- means stone quarry). Gaudi filled a lawsuit won and then donated the money to a convent.Misses Mila waited for Gaudi to die than sells the furniture designed by him and replaced it with a more classical one."

Of two main houses to tour (La Pedrera and Casa Battlo, which is right down the street) I put my money on Casa Battlo. La Pedrera is certainly wonderful however but touring the Casa Battlo is superior to the apartment tour that La Pedrera offers, but La Pedrera may be more interesting for aspiring architects since he designed the entire structure.There is a good museum space on the primary floor which is run separately from the house tour. They often have interesting exhibits going on so you may want to check it out when you're there."

Since there are so many reviews of the house itself, this review is just about the night visit, if you're wondering whether it's worth the extra cost. The night visit does allow you to see the entry hall with late evening and night lighting, which deepens the colors and heightens some of the shapes. The tour consists of a quick introduction in the entrance, a quick visit to the attic, and then a sound and light show on the roof, followed by a glass of cava. The sound and light show is cheesy, to put it mildly. The theme is life on this planet and it starts with images of space, then volcanoes, on through the development of humans, war, and then back to abstracts. Kids might enjoy it, despite the cheesiness, because it's very noisy and colorful. (There is a brief, not-eroticized image of a topless woman in the section on the rise of human life, if that would be a concern.) It's projected onto the chimneys and air vents, but doesn't really add anything to them, I found. So if you're mostly interested in Gaudi, but not so interested that a chance to see some parts of the building at with night lighting is worth it, you can probably skip the night ticket."

Man, what he could have done with LED lighting, modern glazing systems and aluminum building products!!! The roof's fun, the design museum in the attic is extremely insightful, the apartment would have been very comfortable. Yes, this building worked for its inhabitants, didn't need the very beautiful artisan decoration of Lleo i Morera or Palau G\u00fcell or Batllo or Amatller--they were extras to his fabulous designs for living, which you see in this building."

            "review": "Marvellous!. Casa Mil\u00e0, also known as La Pedrera, was a modernist building in Barcelona. It was the last civil work designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed, built from the year 1906 to 1910. It was an innovative project, with a self-supporting stone front and columns, and floors free of load bearing walls. This connected to the internal structure of each floor by means of curved iron beams surrounding the perimeter of each floor. Such constructed technique would allow free structuring of the different levels, so that all walls could be demolished without affecting the stability of the building. The owners then might modify the interior layout at will.Pere Mil\u00e0, a developer, bought a house and hired Gaud\u00ed to design his new home. After the work completed in 1910, Pere Mil\u00e0 and his wife, Roser Segimon moved in a year later until Segimon\u2019s death in 1964. Gaud\u00ed allowed them to rent out the other floors. The building changed hands/management several times and underwent several repairs/restorations. On July 24, 1969, Gaud\u00ed's work received official recognition as a historic-artistic Monument. In 1984, UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site. Gaud\u00ed conceived of this house as a constant curve, both outside and inside, incorporating multiple solutions of formal geometry and elements of a naturalistic nature. Casa Mil\u00e0 actually comprised of two buildings around two courtyards and had nine levels: basement, ground floor, mezzanine, main/noble floor, four upper floors, and an attic. The basement was designed as a garage, at that time, was an innovative idea. The main floor was the residence of the Mil\u00e0s. The rest, over 20 homes in total, was for rent. The layout was like an asymmetrical \"8\". The attic housed the laundry and drying areas, forming an insulating space for the building and establishing levels of the roof. The roof, topped with skylights, staircase exits, fans, and chimneys. Fabricated with tumbrel coated with limestone, broken marble or glass, the design of the roof not only carried a unique architectural purpose also displayed well-integrated (into the building) sculptures.When we visited this building, the roof indeed was the area we took most pictures. \u201cNoble floor\u201d looked modest by today\u2019s standard. In addition, the \u201cwaving shape\u201d of the whole structure made us marveled by the genius/creative idea of Gaud\u00ed."

The roof itself is interesting with its different levels and structures - and the views across the city are spectacular.You then go down to the attic where there is an exhibition on Gaudi and his architecture.You then walk down the stairs to one of the apartments which is laid out as it would have been lived in originally - and how envious we felt as we walked down the staircase passing the apartments that are still lived in today! What a place to live in!There's a shop on the same level as the apartment you can visit as well as somebody who takes your photo which is then superimposed onto three different backdrops - there's no obligation to buy them (it's 10 euros for two). We didn't buy them.You then carry on down to where there was an additional exhibition on show at the time we visited (November 2015) and another, larger, shop before leaving La Pedrera.We had the audio accompaniment for the tour and you have to look out for the relevant number to listen to an explanation of where you are in the building - sometimes the numbers weren't easy to spot so we had to backtrack to get back to the right place.On the whole, I would say we enjoyed Casa Batllo more as La Pedrera wasn't as vibrant and colourful but we still had a really good visit to La Pedrera."

The same courtyards look much more beautiful and mysterious at night, the light show on the rooftop was impressive (as was the nighttime view down over the Passeig de Gracia), and touring in a small group (there were probably only 10 of us?) was much more intimate than the crowds during the day.

It is notable for its structure of stone, brick & metal beams that carry the load bearing functions. Interior partitions can be removed without affecting the structure of the building - a revolutionary concept in its day. This building has an underground car park & winding ramp from the front door through the vestibule - another first! The facade is undulating curves both inside & out. The intricate wrought iron railings are magical. The building is light filled and contains a myriad of fascinating ornamental detail from the mural paintings in the vestibule to the details of the carved doors & especially moulded door handles. The chimneys on the roof with tops like helmets are a fantastic & iconic feature of the building, clearly visible from the street. The audio guide is good."

Normally a long line to purchase tickets but on this last Sunday in October and late in the afternoon we were able to purchase tickets (20 euros each) for the self-guided cassette tour after only a few minutes wait. The living nature at the heart of the building proves to be the iconic gem of this brilliant architect. Designed around a circular courtyard the apartment on the fourth floor recreates how a well-off Catalonian family lived in the early 20th century. The self-guided tour includes exhibits and slide presentations in La Pedrera's attic as well as a \"secret\" to his design genius. Not to be missed is the Roof Terrace with its unique structures, each one a self-contained work of art. If one has only time to visit one Gaudi work in Barcelona, Casa Mila, La Pedrera in the Eixample district would be my choice of preference where one encounters Gaudi's foremost creative genius and where form becomes function. Don't miss it!"

He proves that aspects of buildings can be practical, easy to use and works of art. This is an apartment block like no other in the world.The lower floors are accessible to wheelchair users, but whilst you can get out onto the roof, you can\u2019t go far. The roof and the views from it are magnificent \u2013 so don\u2019t go on a rainy day. But if you are I wheelchair user, make the most of the portholes in the attic \u2013 not as good as going round the roof, but you do get some close-ups of what you missed. In the main tourist season, booking tickets in advance is strongly recommended, but when we visited in October, the main queue was only 5 or 10 minutes long. You can easily spend a couple of hours inside and are likely to take absolutely loads of photos. Their website is well worth a looking at, either before or after your visit and probably both. Try the virtual tour \u2013 though it is a bit sensitive to the mouse. Casa Batllo is a short walk away, which we also visited, but a couple of days later. Too much Gaudi in one day might blow your mind."

Definitely get your tickets online, in advance; the \"Premium\" ticket option is, in my opinion, worth the extra 7 euros... it allows you to simply show up at any time you like (during normal hours) to begin your visit -- you don't wait in a ticket line, or in an admission line, and you don't have to rush there to arrive at an appointed entry time, like other attractions. (I didn't try the night-time roof tour; in my opinion, Your tour includes an audio guide device, which is quite useful. On the premium ticket, you enter directly through the original motor court, then take an elevator nearly to the attic. (A flight of steps gets you there.) The attic is a marvel in itself, with the many, many catenary arches made of brick, undulating throughout the space. Terrific exhibits are set up there, explaining the building, Gaudi's style and innovations, his furnishings, his ergonomic thinking, etc. Very educational, if you've not read much about Gaudi before this.From the attic, you take steps up to the rooftop -- a large, hilly terrace (following the undulating form of the attic below). The chimney stacks and ventilation shafts are the draw here (as is the wonderful view of Barcelona in all directions.) The famous \"Storm Trooper\" (almost evoking the look of the Star Wars character) chimneys are here, along with the big, fat, swirling tiled or stuccoed chimneys. If you're into photography, you could easily spend more than hour on the roof alone -- I certainly did.From the roof you start your descent, to visit a reconstructed apartment, outfitted with period furnishings, to show how an apartment might have appeared for a well-to-do upper-middle class family, back in the day. (Each floor originally had 4 apartments for rent -- the building's owners occupied an apartment spanning the entire 1st floor above street level -- now an exhibit space.)Eventually you'll pass through the exhibit space (which during my visit, had mounted a great exhibit on Modernisme, covering architecture, art, textiles, decorative arts, furnishings, jewelry, etc.) Finally you reach ground level again and exit.The building also has a cafe -- offering the rare experience of dining in a Gaudi-designed space. (You do not need to buy a tour ticket, to enter the cafe.)"

Conveniently, it was a 5 minute walk from our hotel, and a Starbucks was located across the street!We thought the visit would be a quick in and out, however 2 hours later we found ourselves exiting through the gift shop. The self-guided audio tour is very well done, providing not only insights into the amazing structure, but also into Goudi's life and techniques at the time. The tour starts with an elevator ride to the top floor and visit to the roof, which was amazing for its curious design and panoramic view of the city. After the roof, you wander through the attic, where you learn much about the history and Goudi. Last stop before descending an artful staircase is a tour of a top floor apartment.I highly recommend premium admission which allows you to skip to the front of the long line. The additional 7 euro entrance fee saved us a lot of time."

The audio tour was useful (though we kept missing the visual number cues), whimsical roof is a highlight with great views, and we appreciated the chance to walk through one of the flats. The museum space in the attic is worth some extra time to really get perspective on how Gaudi worked- we were glad we went here first, because the models, films, and dioramas gave us some good context for his other works we planned to see later. I'm an architecture nut, and I was thrilled. My parents had no idea what to expect and have no background in architecture, and they really enjoyed this house tour, too.

All of them are absolutely stunning, with this being no exception. Fortunately we seemed to pick a good time to visit, as we barely had to wait in line for a ticket at all and managed to see all of the sculptures and rooms without any trouble. We managed to get in just before it started chucking it down with rain, so it was a good indoors activity. The audio guides are great, I'd advise taking up the offer of one of these for free as it might get a little boring if you don't understand the concept behind the work/aren't an arcitecture nut. My one tiny little issue with it is that it does seem to be overpriced, especially when compared with the other arguably more interesting Gaudi installations in the city. This was the first of them that we visited, so i was quite surprised when the others were significantly cheaper. Maybe avoid if you're on a shoestring budget, but if you've got the money spare then worth a visit."

The hotel suggested La Pedrera and said if we arrived early we wouldn't need to pre-book. This was true. My two colleagues and I got straight in and did the tour. Gaudi was so far advanced in his vision - the block of flats is very impressive, especially the way he designed the roof with its various chimneys. Great views over Barcelona too. You can visit one apartment (the block is still lived in) which is furnished in period, with small Gaudi touches like beautiful floor tiles and carved brass door handles. Lots of nice things in the shop too! When we exited, there was a long queue! Definitely worth a visit but plan ahead or get there early."

Amazing terrace, mouth-dropping - like a piece of another world in this world. Statues, stairs, curves, sculptures - the roof is like a story from a science-fiction book! We explored the roof, then visited the attic and the apartments - and enjoyed all the explanations and exhibits there. We have learned many things about Gaudi, his way of working and his way of thinking and applying into practice. We were very grateful for the opportunity to enjoy a detailed visit at La Pedrera.

Outstanding piece of Gaudi architecture. absolutely worth visiting. we used the Priority entrance (27\u20ac as opposed to 20\u20ac at the main entry point. It was worth the extra to avoid queueing and waiting and you get taken right up to the top by lift - better than walking up 8 floors. The lift is also available for priority visitors to descend again when the tour is over.Everyone also gets a digital audio set (which you wear on a neck-band) with headphones. You select the number on the audio device according to the number displayed at the various locations around the building.The tour (which is self-guided - you don't get a guided tour, just the audio guide - but that is very good) starts on the roof. Sounds un-prepossessing perhaps - but it is amazing! This roof will take you some time to explore.Next comes the attic. again - sounds a bit ordinary, but the structure itself (inverted brick parabolic arches) is fantastic and there is a very detailed series of displays relating to Gaudi's work on the building. The displays run across the attic space. Very interesting.After this you descend one floor to more displays and a short documentary film, and an apartment set up much as it would have been in the early 20th century. There is also a shop there where you can buy souvenirs etc.It really is a remarkable building, and your visit to Barcelona would not be complete if you missed this work by the City's famous architect."

Give yourself a few hours to truly enjoy this beautiful work of art. It has so much to see. Take the elevator upstairs and view a breath taking panoramic scenery of Barcelona while literally standing on art. It is rare that architecture is considered art, but this Gaudi structure definitely fits the bill. After going to the roof, go inside and tour the attic, yes that's right the attic, which is really more of a museum than an attic, but even here the architecture is splendid, like a ships spine. Be sure to watch the short movies and read about each accomplishment, including a bio of the great yet humble man himself. There is another exhibit on the first floor of famous photographs, not Gaudi, but well worth the time to look. The gift shop is also amply stocked and will make you want to take home a memento. Note: we went in June at the height of the season and spent a few extra euros to take the fast track line. We did not purchase tickets in advance. So, if the regular ticket line is long I recommend the fast track line around the corner as it was only a few extra euros each. Also across the street and down a block were some great restaurants that also happen to make great sangria, as you will want to take a break after your adventure. I recommend Consentida Cervesaria off Passage Garcia. Also La Pedrere is a Hop on Hop off stop. Very easy to get to. I spent 3 hours in La Pedrera and worth each second."

La Pedrera is just another beautiful example of Gaudi's work. When I was planning the trip, I was definitely wondering why people were paying 20 euros to get into each of these buildings. After trusting my fellow Trip Advisor members, I can completely understand why. Loved the design of La Pedrera, especially the rooftop. You can get a cool view of Barcelona from the top and learn more about Gaudi's work and vision in the audio guide. There's a section that also gives you a sneak peak at all the other Gaudi landmarks in Barcelona."

You might be tempted to skip La Pedrera--the Sagrada Familia is Gaudi's magnum opus, Casa Batllo gives you more access (since unlike La Pedrera it's no longer used by tenants) and Parque Guell has great outdoor views. But honestly, I loved La Pedrera. It's centrally located, easily accessed from the subway, and has great 360 degree views from the roof--which is also populated by Gaudi's amazing chimneys, which are worth the price of admission alone.However, if you, like me, hate people in your travel photos, I would suggest that you get the very first entrance of the day, skip the intro in the courtyard and run--don't walk--to the top for people-free views. Because, as I discovered first hand, the roof is swamped with people pretty much all day, which means if you want any sweeping panoramas of the roof you will have to position yourself and have a lot of patience for the patch you've chosen to clear. That said, having people in your photos is actually useful for perspective/scale in this case--not that that made me happier about them being there."

We really struggled with scheduling a day and time to visit in advance, because the rooftop experience would've been terrible in the rain (we went in September, and before we left the US, rain was forecast daily). But we didn't want to stand on line or risk not getting in during our visit, so to give ourselves more flexibility in case of poor weather, we bought the \"anytime\" tickets for an upcharge, In retrospect, it was probably unnecessary, since most days had perfect weather, but the upgrade does mean that you don't wait at all--you don't queue for tickets or audioguides, and you go up in a designated elevator. It was a bit of a bonus, since we got to the roof before the crowds arrived, but I'm not sure I'd upgrade again for a shoulder-season visit."

It's too high for what you get to see. Palau Guell, at \u20ac12 is more spectacular and entirely accessible."

But we felt it was well worth it, and we were glad to be able to wander around on our own. In fact, I would say that we enjoyed it more than Sagarada Familia because you get to see Gaudi's work close up. The roof is amazing! The displays in the attic are also very interesting. This was the first of Gaudi's buildings that we visited, and it gives a very good view of his life and work (don't skip the video presentation), as well as some of the technical details of the architecture.

But what is astonishing is that this was effectively a commercial property development of a high rise apartment building. There are of course lot's of nice artistic touches and interesting materials as you would expect from Gaudi, but for me the most interesting aspects was the architectural and technical solutions Gaudi came up with for such things as lighting and drainage from the roof. There seems to be a balance between cost and art here not observable elsewhere in Gaudi's work. Of course when you get out on the roof you can still see Gaudi cut loose with the chimneys and ventilation shafts offering an amazing landscape. As with all of Gaudi's major works you probably won't be disappointed - and as always buy your tickets on-line or at a tourism office. Why is it so many Spanish attractions don't seem to have got their ticketing and entry systems quite right? But a minor quibble for a great visit."

The balance of the tour takes you through an old apartment that was decorated in the time period of the early 1900s. Lines are long for tickets so check out buying online before you go."

Very innovative design which even included elevators and an underground garage! The rooftop terrace which one can access on the tour was the highlight to me with its unusual ornamentation and magnificent views of the city. The other tour areas are the attic below the terrace (which illustrates the structure Gaudi employed and includes several interesting exhibits) and an apartment furnished in the decor of that time.The admission price of 20.50 euros is expensive, but, in my opinion, worth it. To avoid the long line to purchase tickets, I recommend buying online. We wanted to buy tickets for the following day, but normally one is only able to purchase tickets for that day when in person. After a lengthy process, we were finally able to buy tickets onsite for the following day, but it took much explanation as we were leaving the following afternoon and wanted to be sure we could get tickets for an acceptable time."

(A March 2014 visit actually)It's located near our hostel, Generator Hostel, so that's one good point- walking distance from a lodging house. Me and my friends didn't quite realize that this was an attraction, maybe because when we came in, there weren't any queues. If you want to avoid queues, make sure you arrive around 10-11am ish.I like the souvenir shop very much! It opens even if Casa Mila is closed already, and sells many nice books and other stuffs. I can remember this book about Steampunk but opted to not buy, afraid it'll weigh too heavy on my luggage.Overall: The insides are pretty so-so to me. The nice part is when you're on the rooftop, see the warriors' faces, see Barcelona from above, and take pictures! Teehee. The museum part houses the miniature Casa Mila (a model), lots of bronze metal sculptures and furnitures, and some history.I love Gaudi, but this place is pretty average to me. I'd rather spend money on Sagrada Familia, but by paying the entry fee, you'll be supporting this place so it won't cease :) However, if you're only staying here for one day, I don't think this should be one of your to-go destinations. If you have more time and also extra money to spend, go ahead and see this magnificent of an architecture!"

The only part of the property open to visitors is the entrance, which is, in fact, lovely, the attic, which is just an brick clad attic with some architectural models, and the rooftop. Twenty minutes of the tour is devoted to a \"light show\" with dramatic music, during which colored lights are projected onto the structures on the roof. Be warned, this tour requires the visitors climb 7 flights of stairs to the attic, and then more to the rooftop. There is a small capacity elevator, but most of the people in our tour had to walk, without regard to age or fitness. The roof has many steps of varying levels and it is not well lit, so if you are not fit and agile, this is not the tour for you. The other Gaudi monuments are far more beautiful and interesting to visit than this one."

The audio set was extremely helpful for us and recommended.There are NO right angles in this structure, try to imagine a building constructed with no right angles! Combining GaudiS love of Nature and of creating new and unusual structures,this is the one to see. Do not miss the rooftop of this building.When you go earlier you have a better opportunity for photographs, less bodies in the way.there is really no fair way to describe this building.Just Go See It!"

While there is a museum on top that displays furniture and plans it is really the rooftop that shines. If you can see it while there is a rooftop concert (mostly in summer) you will really enjoy this venue even more. In general sunset hours are best views and less crowded."

Then you walk through what is effectively the loft, and once again Gaud\u00ed play tricks with you. The tour finishes in the apartment, which was also very interesting as you can see how people had made this extraordinary building their home. A recorder with head phones is included in the price and it was very interesting and most educational to listen to.

The rest of the building is still in use as offices and apartments.The tour starts in the interior courtyard, then goes on to the rooftop, where all of the chimneys and ventilation shafts are individually designed in surreal, twisted shapes. From the roof, Gaud\u00ed's ongoing legacy building, the Sagrada Familia, is framed by a carefully-positioned arch. Continuing downstairs in the attic space, you get a great appreciation of the building process from a series of displays, and the visible brick arches that support the roof.There is an audioguide included in the admission price, 10% discount if you have a coupon from the hop on bus. Better to prepay online to avoid the queue. There is a lift to the rooftop, and down from the apartment, but quite a few stairs in between."

The museum is well laid out and informative of Gaudi's history, design approach, and intents. Information is included for the designs of several of his famous buildings, not just La Pedrera. Seeing the structure in the attic was fascinating, as well as seeing a preserved flat and the roof. Note that the roof gets slick when wet, so it may be closed when it's raining. We thought we weren't going to be able to see it, but it opened just before we were about to leave, a couple of hours after earlier storms had stopped."

There is also an apartment from the Bourgeois period. Overall it was a very interesting visit and you can choose the language for the audio guide. I chose the Spanish one and it was great. To get there - get the metro to Diagonal, it's a 2-5 minute walk."

Seeing dozens of the same Gothic church design throughout Europe is not satisfying to me.

The only downside - I took the night tour, which was beautiful, but incredibly overpriced at 34 Euros."

You can take a lift to 8th floor or 7th floor and walk one floor, to get to the roof where he designed a water tank and skylights. Once again Gaudi's work is amazing. You visit the attic with laundry rooms, special ventilation panels and more curves and arches. Then you walk down to a floor that has been furnished as an original 1920s apartment which gives an interesting perspective to life, albeit a wealthy one, at that time. Examples of his furniture are near the bookshop. Gaudi really was ahead of his time as he included a lift and underground car park which were unheard of features. The man was a genius!"

Such original, creative architecture is so rarely seen anywhere in the world, and I can't think of another place where THIS type of architecture is found but Barcelona. Of course, this was where Gaudi lived and worked, and it's impossible to duplicate. It is interesting that, like so many other outstanding architectural achievements, Gaudi had his troubles with La Pedrera - cost overruns put Gaudi at odds with Se\u00f1ora Mila, the City of Barcelona had problems with the height of the building (they finally acquiesced), and local Barcelonans of the time couldn't believe what was going up on the Gracia. But people finally got the hang of what they were looking at and today it's one of their proudest monuments to Antoni Gaudi's beautifully original work.

My first visit was really special; I loved learning the history and seeing Gaudi's work. The night show, however, still included bits of the tour that I had just experienced on my own earlier. Because the night tour is guided, I couldn't skip ahead, I had to sit through the same information again. The light show \"Origins,\" was okay, but nothing too incredible. My advice is - go during the day and skip the night show."

I found it easily by metro and saw a huge line and a little sign that said get your tix online. Turned on my cell, bot a tix in minutes and walked in. I was hesitant at 20 euro but I soon learned that most things you do in BCN cost this. And it was worth it. It was a great way to get insights into the genuis of Gaudi and the time period he lived. It doesn't take too long. I did not stay more than a few hours. I went in the morning then could go siesta. Go enjoy this little gem."

Something like a \"stone mine\". Really worth visiting!

Its a large building which used to house a single wealthy (hardly surprising) family in the early 20th century. It is now mostly offices and family apartments. You only get to see the roof and the loft and an apartment but it is really worth it. The roof is amazing. Its like walking into a living museum of art. Up close and personal.

So if you intend to go see this, go early. IMHO, although the entrance was more expensive than Park Guell but it was definitely worth spending the time and money than the Park. The title of my review was from the audio guide's narration when the dean of the architectural school gave the certificate to Gaudi. You can see his ingenious vision in design by visualizing Sagrada Familia with the floor plan mounted on a board hung upside down with chains. Can't say anymore about this without being a spoiler for anyone else planning to visit. The roof & its chimneys showed his playful whimsical side. While his use of scrap metal showed his environmental conservation side. The apartments layouts and floor plan still felt contemporary today is a testament to his forward vision. The whole building is so beautiful, it is a privilege to be a resident there. Gaudi's designs were functional too and so inspiring that architects still pay homage by seeing them in person. We spoke with a New York architect (while in line at La Paradeta) who came all the way just to see them. Even though I am not knowledgeable on architecture, I am still glad I had seen this Unesco site."

Overall the house and views would score a 5, but I particularly dislike being forced to make a \"donation\" to support good causes. I prefer to donate money to causes that I believe are worth while, rather than be forced to pay double what you would pay for sights in other cities (and I have seen many sights that would rival this in many cities). Hence overall a 3 - if you can avoid it, then do it in the knowledge that you are paying over the odds to support their choice of good causes (looking from outside does not give you any real appreciation of it)."

It's wise to book tickets in advance and online, otherwise you will have to stand in line to first buy the ticket and then stand in line to get in - and that's a pretty long wait. Once in, I found the interiors to be just about ok, but what I loved was the rooftop and the attic - that's where the magic is. The forms Gaudi came up with for the room are amazing. Don't miss the attic either - here you will see hundreds of arches that hold up the undulating roof above."

There will be audio guide that will explain you every little thing in Casa Mila. At night, it's more amazing and more beautiful. At the rooftop, the chimneys will be illuminated by special lighting. Make sure you bring your camera when you go there! It's just amazing :) In the end of the tour, I was given a glass of Cava (the famous Spanish sparkling wine), and also some snacks.

You cannot get lost, and the circuit is a real trip to the past.--- Expensive if you come with family--- When you enter, they give you a coupon to get a free photo with the house as a background. Once you get your photo, they let you know you have to buy a photo (that costs 10\u20ac) and you will get another photo for free (with the Casa Batllo as a background). The trick is that they also suggest a third photo (with the Park Guell as a background), and you can get the three for 12\u20ac.

Each ticket comes with a free audio guide and walks you though the entire building. The rooftop is of course the best part. With its amazing sculptures and views. In high season, the lines wrap around the building. I suggest purchasing a premiere ticket. It does cost you more but you can come any day, at any time and skip the line. Definitely worth the few extra bucks to be able to relax and not worry about scheduling it at a certain time, and being able to see everyone's face as you stroll by them in line."

Now you must pay to enter. If you like arquitecture its a total must. If you hate arquitecture this will be the building that will make you change your mind about. Some points to know: the front wall is inclined and this technique was completely unexpected in the time it was built (check the date on wikipedia). Gaudi was working for rich people but some people considered him too much excentric and he had to fight against many prejudices to achieve his goals. He was not apreciated like today at his time. All the buildings he made were made using best materials and most skilled professionals from all around spain. Funny fact: they are still some private owners living in his buildings and every time they have something broken (like a piece of ceiling) they must wait several months for the expert to come and repair the broken part."

The style is not my cup of tea, but the visit is informative and entertaining. The use of the building as a museum has the added value of saving people of living in a Batman style nightmare apartment. It strikes me how genius architects don't usually create pleasant places for us to live. The roof-terrace is specially daunting. At 20.50 euros per person, the ticket price is a rip-off."

We wanted to do an all Gaudi tour while in Barcelona and had been quite impressed by La Sagrada Familia and Casa Battlo so thought we shouldn't miss this one. We could have and wouldn't not have missed much. We did the night tour as it was advertised as a light show with wine. The night visit does not include a visit of the actual apartments. Even if some are still occupied by families, some are empty and it seems that the day visit includes that, which in our sense must be the best part of the visit. We visited the attic, nice ok, but still an attic. We climbed to the rooftop and then got a light and music projection show, it was ok, but very average if you have seen that kind of shows elsewhere. The views of Barcelona were very nice and that was the best part of it. There is no comparison with Casa Battlo in terms of visit. At the end of the visit, we were served some sparkling wine with sweets, that was nice."

Casa Mila, also called La Pedrera (stone quarry), is one of the iconic places in Barcelona that people tell you that you have to visit. A group of six of us did and, for the most part, we were happy we did. The ingenious architect Antoni Gaudi (Park Guell, Sagrada Familia) designed it. He is known for his child-like mix of fantasy and function that together create things of beauty. La Pedrera/Casa Mila was an apartment building for decades and it is astonishing inside and out. Today only two of the original apartment renters remain, both very old; the place is becoming a museum only. We paid extra for the guided tour and this is where there were negatives: our female tour guide seemed more intent on keeping to a schedule than on accommodating individual needs; for instance, several in the tour group had physical limitations and had great difficulty climbing the many flights of narrow stairs. There was a small elevator available but she never told us about it and plunged ahead. The building itself, on the other hand, seemed to reveal one amazing feature after another, from handsome furniture, fixtures, and appointments in the apartments to beautifully crafted interior roof beams in brick. Even the wavy roof offers surprises, like the chimneys that look like guards or sentinels in helmets."

Also, the laser light and music show on the rooftop was very memorable. I enjoyed being able to experience the rooftop botht during the day and at night.

While the entire building is amazing I was most impressed with the roof. There's a spot on the roof where you have a great view of the Sagrada Familia in the distance. I would have loved to visit Park Guell but that will have to be the next time I visit Barcelona. During my adventures I waked by Casa Batllo.

Someone mentioned that in a normal tour you can see an apartment-I don't know if that's true, but I think that would be really interesting to see. The attic was great for learning more about Gaudi's work. They had a lot of models/examples to better understand where his design inspiration came from. The roof was definitely my favorite part though. For The Origins they projected onto the different parts of the architecture-it was beautiful!It could be difficult for people who are terrified of heights; it's not overly high, but there's not a secure feeling with some of the fencing."

Audio guide was very informative any very well presented, easy to follow. The roof looks like \u201cStar Wars\u201d or something close, amazing it is. This is one place you have to see for yourself. After roof top you take steps to the attic and then follow steps down to furnished apartment, which is beautifully decorated. Take time to explore the details, all an all we stayed here 2 hours.We had bought tickets also to night visit (La Pedrera day and night). The roof top light and music show was great experience. We saw how to chimneys awoke to life. Mysterious and magical when music was involved. What we found a bit too much was the approx. 1 h guided tour before the night show. As we had already listen audio guide in the morning there was no need to have all story repeated. Guide was good but we got very little new information. We had night show at 10 pm and night was by then dark enough.We highly recommend both day and night time visits."

The people who led the nighttime tour were very knowledgeable about the history of Casa Mila but dragged the tour for a good hour because they were waiting for complete darkness in order for the rooftop show to be effective. The rooftop magical show was all about how nature influenced Gaudi's vision. I would agree that the views of Barcelona at night and La Sagrada Familia from the rooftop were incredible, but otherwise I would suggest visiting this building during the day time.

We took lots and lots of great photos from all different locations on the roof. Great views of surrounding buildings and city as well.Everyone in our group loved the house and the audio tour and please put this on your must list.We purchased tickets on-line directly from the La Pedrera website for 9:30am skip the line time and went very smoothly. There was the expected crowd but not too crowded so our thought was it is good to do this early if you can.Terrific gift shop also (you can get in without visiting)."

The tour takes you from the roof with its strangely phallic chimneys and ventilation shafts through an introduction to the architecht and the design in the attic and then to a model apartment. I recommend seeing La Pedrara in combination with Casa Battl\u00f3 which is just down the street. Buy your tickets online choosing an early entrance time to beat the crowds, then use a \"fastpass\" (albeit not cheap pass) to bypass the lines at Casa Battl\u00f3."

But after working my way down into the apartment, I was surprised that it was over. That's it. Done. Head down to the exit. Having visited Casa Batllo the day before, I was struck by how much there was to see there compared to here. I think they could lower the price at La Pradrera by a Euro or two and it would feel more just, but if you're a fan of Gaudi or unlikely to return to Barcelona it's probably worth reaching into your pocket to pay for a ticket."

Not only does he show innovations that are still used today, he builds a house that appears to be something from the sea. The more we saw the building, the more impressed I was with it. After reading about the crowds, I purchase the skip the line tickets on line before leaving. Not only do you get to enter from the front, you get to go immediately to the roof at any time you visit. It is hard to say what is the best or most impressive part of the house but the most profound and memorable is the roof. Even in the mid afternoon heat, I could have stayed here for hours. Gaudi is simply amazing in the design. The stairwells and the smokestacks are so well designed and amazing features on there own.What I had no idea about until visiting was the attic which is also impressive and a notable innovation for its time. Next was the apartment. It was amazing the way the courtyards provide so much natural light to the building and the way he designed interior halls around the courtyards, brilliant.Finally you come back to the ground and you really never see the house the same again. Now you are drawn to way it undulates like the waves or the seaweed on its balconies. You have to visit and experience. If you ask yourself then which building to visit as our guide said, Casa Milla is culmination of Gaudi and all of his style, Palau Guell shows not clear style and Casa Balto is a retrofit. While I had already bought my ticket, our Gaudi guide said La Pedrera was the best one if you could only get to one. I will say after visiting I wish I had seen the others, but there is only so much time. So don't waste it, buy your skip the line before you go."

However, I found more interesting the visit to the apartment which has many of the original Gaudi and art nouveau furniture or reasonable facsimiles of original furnishings, everyday conveniences and decor. The audioguide is helpful to understand the building. Don't miss the commentary about the interior patio and garage. Definitively this was a futuristic building designed by a visionary genius.

The views are wonderful too, so take a camera.Next step is the under roof space which houses information on Gaudi's creations including models and very good explanations on the audio guide.Then down to the apartment which has been refitted as it was originally. Very interesting!Then back down to the 'courtyard' with the painted pillars and ceiling before departing.The exterior is a unique shape and you can understand the nickname 'The Quarry'!Well worth a visit and a must visit place on any Gaudi tour!"

I loved the colors and decor. It was an interesting tour. I liked especially the rooftop. Do a little research before so you can appreciate some finer details the tour may not cover. The home is a stone's throw away from Casa Batllo. I think if you like photography, you may want to come earlier in the day or about noon so that the courtyard is lit up and you can appreciate the colors.

Admission includes a good audio guide and you can take your time walking through each area. We went early in the morning, and although there was a small line, we were on the rooftop, where the tour starts, in around 10 minutes. I was not prepared for the quirky sculptures and chimneys on the roof, and the winding twisting paths that give you a 360 degree view over the City.Once you\u2019re finished on the rooftop, you proceed downstairs to the attic area where they have an extremely interesting history of Gaudi, explaining his design principles and the influence of nature in all of his work. He was a brilliant architect and so far ahead of his time. There are also models of some of his other buildings and commissions. As you leave the Attic you go down another floor to the apartment that is fully furnished with period pieces. It shows the lifestyle of wealthy early 20th century living, equipped with all of the latest gadgets and appliances for that time. The building is truly beautiful, with curving walls, balconies looking inward with metal balcony railings, also designed with nature in mind. This is a must see for your visit to Barcelona. Sagrada Familia is obviously his best work, but there you need to deal with crowds, people snapping shots constantly, being pushed around like cattle. La Pedrera provides the ability to truly appreciate Gaudi\u2019s work at your won pace."

He was well ahead of his time, and this is yet another testament to his genius."

This seemed like the best example of an interior building and the most complete history of Gaudi. We booked our tickets ahead online. The admission is quite expensive (everything in Barcelona is to my mind), but I'm glad we went. The admission includes a very good audio guide and although it was busy, it wasn't mobbed the way Sagrada Familia was. We could actually enjoy the visit without bumping into a selfie stick at every turn. The building is beautiful, the story and history of Gaudi and the Mila family was extremely interesting. The rooftop terrace is beautiful as is the Pedrera Apartment. The attic contained many unique exhibits and was really well done. Highly recommended."

It is thought to be his ultimate creation bringing together all the design elements of nature that he was well known for. The exterior facade is simply different even for today and looks like a giant sand castle.La Pedrera or The Quarry was the diminutive nickname given to this very modern home of its time which unfortunately was not well regarded by the community then. The casa is now owned by a Spanish bank and open to the public for tours.A tour through La Pedrera is a must to understand Gaudi's vision. The building has no straight lines at all and it felt like it alternated being part forest and part sea at various times. The first floor was owned by the Mila family and the rest of the 4-5 floors were rented out. I envy the four families who come from the original renters that are still entitled to live there for very little rent due to controls. They are however, the last generation to be accorded this occupancy privilege. Couple facts that I found interesting which you could check out yourself - La Pedrera was designed to have electricity and elevators - two modern inventions in the world in the early 1900s. More fascinating was Gaudi's foresight to design undercover car parking accessed through the front doors when not many cars were around! The attic area meant for laundry drying was a fascinating space of parabolic curves. It now houses exhibits to explain the design of the building in relation to nature.We decided to explore La Pedrera at night and took The Origins tour, introduced only in the last three months. This is an audio-visual light show telling the story of the beginning of life projected onto the awesome \"guardian-like\" sculptures at the rooftop of the casa. The show which was for about 30 mins was magical.Booking is recommended as there are limited spaces for the night visits. There is a choice of tours in several languages, with the English tour starting at 9.15 pm for about over 1 hr. At the conclusion, drinks and sweets were served at the foyer area enabling the patrons to enjoy the atmosphere of La Pedrera. Note that there is a discount ticket to The Origins at La Pedrera if you take the Barcelona City Tour hop on hop off bus. Enjoy - we did!"

Even compared to other Gaudi buildings (Casa Batllo, Palac Guell), this is unique and worth a special trip. Gaudi was meticulous in his designs to consider light, ventilation and water drainage and storage. Find it on Google maps --- in the satellite view, you can see large \"holes\" in the roof which are the open spaces inside the structure designed to give every room natural outside light. The roof itself is a sculpture garden of mysterious chimneys with an undulating surface that would be tempting to skateboarders. The attic has a very good museum with upside down models that show how he designed his structures. Also videos of his other buildings and examples of furniture. In this respect, a visit to Casa Mila gives you a better and broader appreciation of his work than Casa Battlo. Also the apartment you tour has period furniture, which positively adds to the experience, where as Casa Batllo has no furniture other than a few Gaudi chairs. Don't miss the on-demand hot water heater in the bathroom --- a brass box on the wall with gas and water lines obviously so the water could be heated as it flowed to the sink or tub. An example of technology that even most U.S. homes still don't have today!Buy tickets on-line at https://www.lapedrera.com/en/home. For an extra fee, you can get 'premium' tickets to be able to enter any time, an advantage if your schedule is uncertain. Lines for Mila are likely longer than at Batllo. My personal priority for visiting Gaudi works : Sagrada Familia, Casa Mila, Parc Guell, Casa Batllo, and Palac Guell. You can't do them all in one day-- need two or three at least."

We loved our visit to Pedrera as we were able to look around the wonderful and quirky building but at a time when there were less people there so we had time to spend really taking it in and appreciating it. You get a headphone set so you can find out more about the rooms and about Gaudi's wonderful masterpiece.The building is astounding, Gaudi's imagination is unbelievable! We had a wonderful time looking around the building, taking in all the little quirky bits and interesting rooms. It was particularly lovely to go up on the roof terrace and watch the sunset whilst taking in the wonderful views of Barcelona and the towers on the rooftop.After having explored la pedrera we made our way down to another terrace and found a small table to sit at, ready for the concert to begin. You got one drink with your ticket and then were given a card so that you could have further drinks or small appetisers and they would be put on the card and you could pay at the end. Although we did not have the food, it looked delicious.The entertainment was wonderful and the singer had a beautiful voice and performed for around an hour before the set was finished. The entertainment did not go on for as long as we would have expected, but what they did they did well and it created a wonderful sound to sit and enjoy a beautiful summers evening. Although we went here last year, the memories are still fresh in my mind and helped to make our trip to Barcelona a memorable one."

We went back to the premier queue girl and said they wanted 40 Euros - Oh yes she says you pay that inside - I'm left wondering if she would have told me about the 40 euros up front or just taken my 7 Euros and let me find out too late..So it may be fabulous inside but but from what I read from others we made the right choice for us."

To be honest, when I was planning my trip to Spain, seeing rooftop photos of La Pedrera/Casa Mil\u00e0 was the main reason I booked a trip to Barcelona. As a fan of architecture, I was intrigued by his work, and in Barcelona you can't go 2 minutes without hearing about or seeing something designed by Gaud\u00ed. As I stated, the rooftop terrace was my favorite part, each beautifully designed chimney stack reminding me of a chess piece. The view of Barcelona is incredible. I also loved the Attic, the above view from the ground floor courtyard, and the beautiful wrought-iron curved balconies (best viewed from street level). I'm telling you, this attraction is NOT to be missed.I will admit though, I found the interior rooms themselves/kitchen/furniture/etc. not as impressive, but that just may be me."

The guide continually went on about this being the best Gaudi building and to a certain extent dismissed the other Gaudi works. The apartment that is open to the public during the day is shut to the night tour and frankly if you are going to visit I believe the day tour to be a better option."

Stunning exterior of building too. I was initially unsure if we would visit this sight but I am so glad I went up to the roof, it was one of my favourite things to do in Barcelona. You may want to time a visit when its less busy if you are into photography (we were there around lunchtime and there were a fair few visitors on the rooftop), you end up with a lot of other visitors in the photos when its busy or waiting until they have moved on. Fantastic experience, totally recommend it."

There is a locker facility for strollers and backpacks, once inside the gates.Even the wait for the elevator is lovely, since you walk through the organically shaped interior courtyard with apartment windows facing in and sunlight streaming down from above.The tour begins on the rooftop, which is more beautiful than you'd imagine an apartment roof top to be. There are great sculptures where the chimney flues are and recycled glass bottle walls, as well as great vistas of the city. (It can get scorchingly hot since it is a roof, in the city, in Spain so go early, late or wear a hat).Inside the attic is a nice mini-history of Gaudi exhibit with videos, photos and edificio models- my children really liked this part, especially the chairs to sit on and the cool interior.I enjoyed the Beaux Arts/ turn-of the century staging of the apartment portion of the tour. It is easy to imagine how lovely it would have been to have lived in such a light-filled, gracious apartment overlooking Paseo de Gracia.The bookstore was a notch above the usual tourist store.

The family lived here for 20 years and tenants still live on the upper floors. The Audio was quite good with tours beginning on the roof with its 30 some colorful chimneys and ventilation towers. The attic's many brick arches support the roof and now house an interesting museum with very good audio visuals about Gaudi, the current events of his time and his works. The next floor was a 19th c apartment with a large kitchen, separate servant's dining room, children's room, servant's bedroom, a very large modern bathroom, bedroom, lovely living room and dining room separated by sliding doors and master bedroom with an adjoining bath.

The audio guide was very helpful. (Note: they show a short video during the tour of the apartment...skip it if you don't have time. The video showed footage from the time period of Gaudi but not much about Gaudi or his work). I would definitely visit La Pedrera to see some essential Gaudi architecture. Tip: In general, we found that late afternoon was the ideal time to visit other top attractions (Sagrada Familia, Picasso Museum) if you are not able to reserve online and commit to a definite time."

A word of caution though - get there early as the queues can be quite long.Another word of caution - one can pre-book tickets for this venue but when we visited, the queue for collecting pre-booked tickets was longer than the queue for buying tickets on the day!If you are staying in a hotel, ask the receptionist for a book of discount vouchers. These are pretty readily available and will give you a 10% discount on the entry price. Every little helps!!La Pedrera (also known as Casa Mil\u00e1) was a pretty outlandish piece of architecture when it was first built and encountered considerable resistance from the planners. However, it is now of course regarded as an iconic building and another testament to Gaud\u00ed's genius.The roof-top and attic are particularly unusual but, because so many people are 'pushed through' this attraction, that getting some decent photographs is quite challenging.Don't be put off too much by the queues. It is worth the wait."

After going through the ground floor of the courtyards [which are arranged beautifully themselves] you are taken straight up to the roof. Where I could of sat all day. It is a very special space. But if you are very timid of heights be warned it is a bit vertiginous. The parapet is fairly low around the outer edge and with the changes in levels you do feel a bit exposed. The attic space under the roof is almost as perfect with its thin thin brick arches. The apartment is furnished in period [although doesn't manage to convey the feeling of having been lived in like that - more museum and less apartment] .Then the temporary exhibition space in which we saw an extensive exhibition of documentary and promotional photography.You get an audio guide included which for that sort of thing is quite good with some musical interludes. It was starting to annoy me towards the end as these things tend to. I dislike being told what I will of noticed and some of the level of the commentary was aggravatingly shallow but as attempts go it was a good one. Exiting through the gift shop twice! [ one near the end and one at the end] and the scheme for getting your photo taken in front of a green screen etc cheapens it a bit.All in all I felt like I got a lot of visit for my money. The roof is the star attraction by a long way but most of the rest adds on. "

We started with La Pedrera at 9 am, when it opened, followed by Sagrada Familia at noon and Park Guell at 3. For all three sites we had booked tickets with timed entries online, which made life a lot easier. The lines at Sagrada Familia, in particular, were very long. Booking the tickets online is easy - waiting in long lines to get them on-site is not.La Pedrera was fascinating, with an audio-tour that comes with entry that is quite helpful, though it's easy to miss the numbered sites and get behind. The tour starts on the roof, with great views of the city, followed by a tour of the attic - my favorite part of the tour. The attic was beautiful, with vaulted brick ceilings filled with displays about both Gaudi and the Mila House. You then get to tour one of the apartments in La Pedrera with original furnishings. All in all a well laid out tour, which took us about an hour and a half to complete. Of the three sites we visited that day, this would be our second favorite, behind Sagrada Familia."

If you have to choose based on running a low budget, save the money and choose the Sagrada Familia, I think this is the best work of architecture that reflects the glory of Gaudi as a master.I disagree with such a high entrance entrance fee but it is always crowded and tourist will not stop visiting it, so if you wait for justice for low budget travellers like I did, it will not happen, prices will remain, so up to you to prioritize according t your travel budget."

If you are interested in architecture, just getting in the attic is marvelous, so you can see the constructions techniques. The entry fee is about 15 Euros."

For the money, you basically get to walk through the \"attic,\" which houses a nice musuem depicting the home's construction, but the light show obscures rather than highlights the beauty of the roof chimneys, and I suspect Gaudi was rolling his eyes at the whole show from his crypt. Also, be warned, you do not get to see one of the apartments as part of the night tour, that is only on the day tour."

            "review": "Gaudi's Art Nouveau Masterpiece. On our recent whirlwind march inland from the Mediterranean to Paris, we spent two nights in Barcelona. This was not our first trip to the city. In 2001 we'd visited the narrow corridor from the airport to the seaport and back. That's barely enough for a first impression. This time I had the better part of two days to take a closer look at the city and particularly two architectural works by the Spanish turn-of-the-century architect, Antonio Gaudi. I wanted to see his famous Sagrada Familia church and his brilliant, Art Nouveau, apartment complex, la Casa Mila (known more commonly to the locals as La Pedrera--the stone quarry). If you're visiting, keep in mind it may be listed on maps either way. There's much more to see in Barcelona than that but we were on a tight schedule and in any case, could not have done justice to any attractions if we'd included other attractions.We in the 21st-century are somewhat accustomed to seeing radical architecture, and even today, Casa Mila would appear to fit easily into that category. Imagine then, what the Barcelonans must have felt and thought around 1906-10 when Antonio Gaudi's apartment house and home for the wealthy businessman, Pere Mila and his wife, Roser, began to take shape. The style was called Art Nouveau and Gaudi was not exactly an unknown entity at the time. His Casa Batllo on the same street (Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia) dated from as early as 1877. However, it was Romantic in style, only slightly resembling the new Mila home with its wavy lines and impressive height, not to mention a undulating roofline topped with whimsical sculptural chimneys (right) unlike anything imaginable at the time . In fact, the floor plan reveals there was hardly a rectangular room in the entire building. With its seven floors, six of which containing four spacious, luxury apartments, (plus a huge attic and underground parking garage) Pere Mila was getting his (wife's) money's worth.Gaudi's radical new Art Nouveau styling did not stop with the sweeping and swooping of his carved stone fa\u00e7ade. Two well-like open air courtyards brought an airy lightness to even the interior rooms of each apartment (two apartments shared an elevator and stairwells). Even the attic (or perhaps, especially the attic) was radical, its hyperbolic arches resembling the ribs of a giant whale, except that they were made from shaped bricks. Whereas most roofs are treated by architects as necessary nuisances of no other function than not leaking, Gaudi's Casa Mila roof more nearly resembles rolling hills or ocean waves, a delightful fantasy experience in and of themselves, not to mention an impressive view of the Barcelona skyline. Today, only one apartment is open to the public. The rest of the building serves as office space for the organization owning and managing the structure. The single apartment presents some fascinating anachronisms as the Victorian furniture tries to appear comfortable inside curvilinear rooms that even today, would present an interior decorator with some vexing problems.(Gaudi custom designed Art Nouveau style furniture for the Mila's apartment.)Even before the house was completed, Mila's wife complained to Gaudi that without straight walls, she had nowhere to place her much beloved grand piano (which she played exceedingly well). Gaudi's reaction was typical: \"So, play the violin.\" The Milas occupied the ground floor of the building with the upper levels carved (an exceedingly accurate term) into some twenty surprisingly large apartments. The attic contained the laundry and storage space. Today it features an insightful museum display of architectural models, drawings, and historic photos of the building. Tickets are 27 euros (roughly $30.) and best ordered online to avoid waiting in line."

Precious few can share his vision, but at least we can try to emulate it in whatever form our passion cares to take."

With a good camera (one that does well at night) you'll get phenomenal photos not possible during the day. > Because of the later start time, your day is wide open, which is great if you have limited time and want to cram as much in as possible. Cons> 34\u20ac is too expensive for this tour, really, but it's the only way to see the light show on the roof. > The shop and cafe are closed at night, so no souvenirs unless you return during the day. > The tour is pretty short. An hour, I think. And once the roof show is finished, you're not really welcome to hang out up there. They don't kick you out, but they don't leave the roof lit so you can take pictures either. They really want you to leave so the next group can come out to see the show. I'm glad I went because of the small crowd and light show, but it was a bit pricey for this budget-conscious traveler. "

Though nothing compares to the Sagrada Familia in scope, I found this home to be much more accessible. The tour included and audio guide and I got to the house just before 9:30 and there was no line! The tour begins on the roof, which is just a fanciful playground even for adults. I guarantee you that you will smile when you see it. The tour continues in the attic, where there are a plethora of demonstrations and audioguide information on Gaudi's architectural style, geometric models, nature-based inspiration, ergonomic furniture, etc. The models include other projects that Gaudi completed including Park G\u00fcell and Casa Batll\u00e1, so I felt like I truly got both an overview of Gaudi's complete works and an in-depth look into his artistic/architectural process. Keep in mind that this was the last project Gaudi completed, and he had full control over the building and design process (unlike Casa Batll\u00e1, which had a skeleton building in place -- though I'm sure the tour is still impressive) so it shows his full range of talent. If you have 2 or 3 hours to spare in Barcelona, I highly recommended a trip here."

It is definitely worth a visit, but I would suggest seeing this building before going to the Sagrada Familia. Compared to the Sagrada, the other Gaudi sites are not as awe inspiring. I particularly found the vaulting and ribs of the roof structure very interesting...I have to believe that this was done free form without tight blue print control. Gaudi, in general, reminds me of the freedom of expression that a child has when they discover mold-able and malleable wet beach sand for the first time, spending a whole day making castles, tunnels and moats."

Start in the central courtyard with shapes and colors in the stone and iron work: tour the apartment that is not lived in but set up in the style of his time; see his avant garde ways of bringing light into the building with a central courtyard; admire his lack of straight lines and load bearing internal walls; visit the graceful brick arches of the attic to see exhibits showing the inspiration for his work - everything from trees, leaves, snakes, snails and the sea; and enjoy the pinnacle, the famous fun roof on top of it all. The roof was our favorite place of the visit. There are different levels, with easy steps up and down; almost Star Wars or Easter Island inspired architectural sculptures which decorate stairwells, ventilation towers and chimneys. There are fabulous views of the city and you can find two places on the roof (pointed out in the audio tour) where you can take a picture of religious buildings through a rooftop archway - the Sagrada Familia and another church perched on top of a mountain, all done on purpose by this grand architect.I recommend that you buy your tickets online ahead of time so you do not have to wait in line and go early in the day to avoid the crowds. Many people chose between La Pedrera and Casa Batllo since they think that seeing one of his buildings is enough. I have to disagree, for myself at least. The two buildings are so very different. Both showcase Gaudi's style and very avant garde ideas, but La Pedrera shows his thought process using the stunning attic space while Casa Batllo showcases more of his decorative touches."

Up to the top in the lift (or via the stairs) and you'll find the wonderfully bizarre sculptures on the roof (chimneys, access to stairs etc). The undulating roof just adds to the playfulness of it all.The exhibition a floor below (under the functional but beautiful brick-built catenary arches) gives just enough background to Gaudi's architectural techniques and a bit of background to Barcelona of the early 20th century.Down a further floor to the apartment, and you must take your time and look around to enjoy all the details. No line is straight unless it REALLY has to be, no surface is without playful embellishment. Over the top? If it sounds like it then I haven't done it justice - it's SO beautifully done!Please, please visit La Pedrera - it's just as worthy as the Sagrada Familia."

This is a Gaudi building with no straight lines ! We took the self guided tour with free multi-lingual audio headsets which were marvellous. The tour starts with a lift trip to the roof. When you step out onto the roof you cannot believe your eyes with the wierd shapes around you and the steps going up and down between them. There are two arches which Gaudi buiit to frame two other buildings - the Segrada Familia is one of course - his masterpiece. The tour then takes you into the attic where there are curious brick arches which are explained later when there is a demonstration of how Gaudi designed his buildings. There are also reproductions of some of the furniture Gaudi designed with the exact contours of the user in mind - also door handles and drawer knobs originally moulded in clay exactly as the user had gripped it to push or pull. One more floor down and there is an apartment laid out exactly as it would have been in the early 20th century. The lower floors are still in use as offices."

If you are time poor or Euro poor, perhaps choose only one of La Pedrera or Casa Batilo, and I would go for the latter. Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya has a larger collection of original Gaudi furniture and is included on the multi museum pass. I think La Pedrera is definitely worth visiting."

Built for a private family, this house offers many great lessons about how this man created buildings. While the exterior is unlike any other, do take the tour and don;t miss the vaulted attic, which is now a museum showing how Gaudi worked and what influenced him. Of course, one must visit the roof and pay respects to the alien-like sentinels that not only cover the chimneys, but provide a other-worldliness that is strangely comforting.Lucky residents still inhabit the building, but visitors can tour one floor and the main floor. The gift shop offers miniature sentinels to grace your desk back home. Well worth the time to learn more about this amazing architect and bravo to Barcelona for embracing these treasures."

There was a lack of visitor information outside the building as to the options for entry and they would benefit from a team of marshals to help visitors. Many people were milling about aimlessly outside the entrances, not knowing what the system of entry was.Inside there are more queues to gain access to the roof but once in the experience is awesome. Visitors are admitted to the ground floor area, the roof, the attic which houses an impressive display of Gaudi's work, and a residential suite open to the public.We enjoyed the whole visit but, with queueing and viewing, it took up a whole half day out of our weekend which some may feel is excessive."

Regarding Casa Mila, one cannot help but marvel at the free-flowing rooftop. And I found the entryway and stairs to the second floor to have an understated subtle beauty with color and non-linear shape. Check out the ceiling to what I believe is the second floor gift shop, just off the atrium up steps to the left of the entry -- it looks like ocean waves. The \"attic\" of the building is under a vaulted ceiling. After that, I was less impressed. The apartment that was open to visitors was well-designed considering the space available, but otherwise unremarkable. Do opt for the audio tour equipment, which I found useful."

We went to see La Pedrera as a second thought after seeing Casa Battjo (pronounce Casa Batyo'). As the latter is a masterpiece of magical, fairy tale designs and a plethora of colors enhanced by the natural light, La Pedrera seems a bit murky but equally fascinating. Black wrought iron balconies in a wave line with the lime stone background is kind of intriguing. So we paid the extra bucks (or Euros in this case) and entered without waiting in line. La Pedrera is still occupied by people and hence only the courtyard (very interesting), one apartment, attic and the roof are to be viewed by tourists.The apartment was ok but not extremely interesting unless you are into that era's furnishings, layouts, etc.and we were not. The attic has an interesting collection of Gaudi's history, maps, different projects, etc. Since we ran out of time we did not spent too much time there. What really \"made it\" for us was the roof. It was again a fairy tale kind of shapes that he created - chimneys had rounded, twisted shapes, there were all kinds of structures normally never seen on the roof. And it also offered a magnificent views of Barcelona, you could even see the Meditterean Sea in the distance. One word of caution - you arrive there by the elevator, but the exit is not marked and the entry to the elevator was blocked. We were going around and around laughing that we cannot find the way out of there. Well, we were not alone. We ended up forcing our way into the elevator's entrance (followed by 5 or 6 other \"lost souls\") and getting down that way to the surprise of the staff at the bottom...."

One must consider whether 42 Euros for an audio tour is a prudent expenditure. We had not been to the Casa Mila before and I must admit it was well worth the expenditure. Since being purchased by a Catalonia Bank, the building has been painstakingly restored to much of its original state making it into a museum and a tribute to one Gaudi's most significant monuments. We went on a Thursday morning shortly after the site opened for the day and there was but a short line for tickets and admission.

La Pedrera is a wonderful example of this with the way the design of the central courtyards bring light into the buildings and are then embellished with artistic flair. The famous roof allows him to have a bit of creative fun with the chimney pots.But for me, the most interesting part was the attic space. Not an area for common view it is here that his innovative and practical design is seen at its best in the way the graceful brick arches provide both structure and strength whilst maximising the use of space. The design is also energy efficient (intentionally so) and illustrates how forward thinking Gaudi was.Yes, Gaudi's work is good to look at, but it really is important to read the exhibits and listen to the audio guide to better appreciate the elegance of his designs. Like many of the Gaudi exhibits, the visit here is not cheap but it is worth it. Buy tickets in advance as it seems that those that don't wait a very long time to get in at peak times."

This time I pre-ordered tickets through the internet and went inside without having to wait on a long line. This is a very popular attraction, second only to Sagrada Familia so there are usually crowds. It is on a lovely street, Passeig de Gracia - Barcelona's version on NYC's 5th Avenue. . The best part was the roof but the apartment was awesome too. Next time I am going to do the roof at night which is a different fee ( a tad more expensive but limited to 20 people at a time so less crowded). The roof looked surreal and I imagine more so at night. Can't wait!Visited May 2015"

It had a nice gift shop without the usual tourist tat. Two big tips. 1: The entrance on the corner of the building on the road intersection is for premier tickets and is more expensive - the entrance to the right is the normal entrance. 2: The queues were long to get in so we walked a few metres to the nearest cafe, got a beer and bought tickets on my smart phone. Then back to the separate entrance right at the front of the queue and straight in. Queuing saved and got a beer in the sun as part of the deal. If you do one Gaudi building in Barcelona then my recommendation would be Palau Guell."

However, you can get a good look at some of Gaudi's famous fantasy chimneys from the street level in you cross the street and give yourself a bit on a angle.The architecture, though challenging, is fascinating. What seemed to work best in the modern city environment was the wrought iron balustrades that flowed over and out of the terraces. They are supposed to evoke seaweed, and they do feel like metal plants growing down the building. If you are in Barcelona, you should definitely go take a look, especially as this is a shorter walk from the \"Block of Discord\" which had three famous houses (one by Gaudi)."

And all the Gaudi embelishments (?) were right there for picture taking (you might have to wait a few minutes to get a clear shot tho). The tour ends in an apartment which was very interesting to see the layout of the bedrooms, kitchen, living and bathing areas. We walked by at night when there were no crowds to see how the building was lit. We could see additional details in some of the lower apartments - very unique. I would say this is a do not miss (along w Sagrada Familia)."

For the price of admission you see a typical apartment, the stairwells, the rooftop (worth the price), some museum-style displays and an exhibition space - showing lacklustre photography, not associated with Gaudi, on our visit - that we found very disappointing and a poor note to end on.

The refurbished apartment is also excellent, though a wee bit jarring' in the 'fit' between Gaudi's brilliant design and early20th century style.

The outside fa\u00e7ade was under restoration and shielded by screening.The visits to the apartments, the attic and the rooftop exceeded expectations. The apartments are a time capsule of Barcelona life in the early 1900s. The attic is for lovers of architecture - most fascinating were the upside-down models he developed to analyze the structural elements of his work - well in advance of computer analyses. The rooftop offers great views of Barcelona as well as the whimsical chimneys of Gaudi.This house, as well as the other Gaudi works at Parc Guell and La Sagrada Familia, are the premier sights in Barcelona in my estimation. This site is worth 2 to 3 hours of your time. They will be forever engrained in your memory."

Great talking recorded guide, nice short video films and the models gave us the behind the scenes background. This museum home will bring out the dreamer and artist and remind us to dream big and create our dreams and bring them to reality. Gaudi did this... A definite on any Barcelona trip.

However we paid 3 euros to see a photography show on the 2nd floor for 3 euros and then just climbed the stairs to the top floor and roof (good exercise!) - for that price it was worth it. The apartment is furnished in 50s style and its redeeming feature is that there are no straight lines - interesting but not gushingly so - and the roof is worth a look. Its not very practical though should anyone want to use it for anything useful - no level spaces. For 3 euros I would see it if you can sneak in!! Nice gift shop on 1st floor."

The designs and decor of the lifts,the hall, the kitchen, the doors are so efficient and clean. The pre recorded head phones are useful to introduce one to the history and detailed planning by the architectural genius, even without a guide.

She took the time to show me how the plaster moldings surrounding the doors had been hand formed by pressing ones thumb into the fresh plaster. I think the highlight of my visit was when she showed me the bedroom that had been hers as a child had a poem inscribed in the ceilings plaster that has been written by Gaudi himself.

It is undoubtedly a significant contrast to the ornate Casa Batllo further down the same street; I personally loved it because I think that the whole thing works in harmony - fine materials, detail and quality of finish but not as colourful.It is possible to go inside but for a significant entry fee; given the wealth of other things to see and do in Barcelona we didn't return."

The museum was very informative and explained a lot of features also found in Casa Batllo, but were explained much better. It is not only a fantastic aesthetic achievement, it is an engineering one as well. The rooftop is spectacular with all of its fanciful chimneys. We must have spent 45 minutes on the roof. The museum occupies the attic, with all of its catenary arches, which were used in Casa Batllo and the Sagrada Familia and allow the entire structure to be supported by its walls -- no interior wall is load-bearing. The apartment tour was also very interesting. While there were many modern conveniences (very modern for the time!), the apartment is modest and contrasts somewhat with the spectacular building itself. I think we ended up spending nearly 3 hours going through the whole tour -- we were very thorough and you could do it quicker, but if you want to savor it, there is a lot to savor."

We tour around one of the flat on 4th floor and then move no to Attic and finally at the roof top. I would not say much of details in here because you will need to be there to understand the work behind it with the real thing in front of you. The tour ends with champagne and Q&A. It might be a bit pricy comparing to other two main attractions. However, you are with a small group and the building does not have other people around you.

It is not a cheap visit. However, there is a lot to the museum and there was a lot of very interesting information to take in and the audio guide was included. Being able to go out onto the rooftop was amazing; the views of Barcelona were stunning and you can even see La Sagrada Familia through one of the arches - at sunset this was gorgeous. My husband is a very big fan of Gaudi and he was bouncing with delight at every different part of the building that he encountered. We both agreed that this was the best thing to visit in Barcelona. We spent over 2 hours here and, if we hadn't arranged to meet a friend at a certain time, we would have probably stayed longer!"

The whole attic space is dedicated to Gaudi. You learn a lot more about him at this attraction than Casa Batllo. Don't use a tour guide, just get the free audio guide so you are free to move about on your own will. The ticket line was not bad, but it was not at high season. I would suggest buying tickets online during high season."

Both are amazing and well worth visiting. It would be hard to say which is best, both are great in their own way. The surprising thing is how far ahead of their time Gaudi's designs were. Much of what Gaudi included is only now being championed in Eco design."

With a reasonable entry price of \u20ac20 (children \u20ac13) the Pedrera is a great family sight seeing spot. An audio guide lasting approximatly 40 minutes guides you around the roof terrace, attic and one of the appartments. The rest of the appartments are sold as appartmentst to live in so these are not available to look around. A lift offers a break for any tierd legs as you dont need to walk up to the roof terrace. However, there once you get up to the roof, there are quite a few steps that would cause quite a pain for a buggy or wheelchair. At the end of the tour, there is a gift shop which sells some memorabilia of Gaudi's architecture."

Definitely worth visiting to complete your exploration of Gaudi's work in Barcelona, but not as complete or impressive as some of the others. You get to see some parts of the building (ground floor courtyard, attic, roof and one of the apartments), with an extensive exhibition covering Gaudi's work. If you have limited time, in order of priority, I can suggest starting with Sagrada Familia, Casa Batlo, Palace Guell, and only after that Park Guell and Casa Mila."

But still well worth a visit. Late afternoon light was beautiful for taking photos of the rooftop, a highlight of my trip to Spain.The lift takes you past 3 floors not opened to the public, allow for at least 2 hrs to see everything if you are a Gaudi fan, we were on the roof for an hour alone! Lovely views of the city.The attic has amazing parabolic arches & a very informative display of how it was built. Has little seats where you can rest & watch continuous slide shows.Enjoyed the fully furnished apartment showing what it was like to live there in early 20th century. Check out the floor of the photo display room, interesting green patterned tiles, unsure if originals.Wandered around the ground floor court yard where beautifully painted staircase walls are floodlit, shows off the ironwork & railings. Cafe & usual gift shop on bottom floor, also a few seats out on the street just to gaze at the structure. Hope to visit again when the facade is unveiled, in the meantime, bought a postcard to remind me!"

The use of curved walls rather than the straight wall with which we are familiar was of special interest to me. It is well worth a visit .

We were first in the line for entrance on the day we visited and it really paid off - we were the first people to access the roof top and it was stunning (with the added bonus of having tourist free pictures!) the views across Barcelona are pretty good, but in particular the sculptural aspects are amazing. That said if you aren't good with heights it may not be the best place to go! I am really scared of heights and I could just about cope - not sure I would have if it was busy though.The museum section is great but one of the best bits is being able to look around the apartment that is restored to how it would have been in it's original time - beautiful!Seriously recommend a visit to see a truly amazing piece of history!"

There was no queue (rare for Europe!), so we bought our tickets and walked straight in. The tickets are fairly expensive by European standards, but you have an audioguide included in your entry price. The audioguide was very informative, if a little wanky, and Clinton frequently chuckled at the unnecessarily verbose descriptions of the architectural features. The rooftop, with its chimneys topped with glass fragments and broken Valencia tiles, and amazing views over Barcelona was a highlight for me. We also learned about how Gaudi created his works in the impressive attic, which has been set up as an exhibition space. It has an arched roof and exposed brickwork, and despite being built more than 100 years ago, looked very modern. Gaudi often hung chains from boards that were suspended from the ceiling, which would fall in the parabolic shape that he featured so prominently in his designs. By looking at the reflection of these chains in a mirror, Gaudi would see what his creations would look like. An amazing tribute to a man well before his time!"

Another of his undulating fa\u00e7ade but less ornate compared to Casa Batllo has a Goth feel with its black iron beamed balconies. This building has a lot of innovative elements in its design foremost are the free of load bearing columns and walls. The chimneys on the roof are reminiscent of Chateau Chambord in Loire Valley but this time with a warrior-esque niqad and burqa inferences."

I stayed in Barcelona for half a year and this building never ceased to amaze me. It's worth visiting from the inside, great museum exhibition and beautiful rooftop decorations by Gaudi himself with a view on neighbourhood where is also located his Casa Batlo. 5 stars experience!"

Everything about the structure was impressive in its own quirky and unique way. Next to La Sagrada Familia, we considered this our favorite sight (and must see attraction) in Barcelona. The exterior is impressive and iconic, but it is really the rooftop and interior that steal the show. The roof is amazing for views of the chimneys/structure itself and the surrounding city. We went at dusk, which I highly reccommend, and got some excellent photos. From here, there is a museum in the attic that shows Gaudi's design methods/thought process, which is very interesting. The highlight for me was the ergonomic furniture and designs of door handles, chairs, etc. that Gaudi made. The other highlight was the floor showing how high-class Catalans would have lived in early 20th Century Barcelona. This provided context into the building, the city, and Spanish life and history that we didn't get anywhere else in Barcelona.We didn't visit Casa Battlo, but chose this because of its 1) cheaper entry fee and 2) interior attractions, whereas Casa Battlo is more or less bare inside (from what I understand). We didn't regret our decision, especially since you can walk past Casa Battlo if you're coming from Placa de Catalunya and glance at the impressive exterior of that building on the way to La Pedrera."

It is a fantastic example of Gaudi's work and well worth a visit. We bought tickets in advance so we didn't have to queue.

The eccentric nature of Antoni Gaudi's architectural vision permeates through Barcelona in many instances. La Pedrera is one of the best examples of Gaudi's architecture and also shows many exhibits demonstrating the function behind his structural nous. Some will say the price of admission is a bit on the steep side. It may be, but I would say it is worth it to be on the roof of this building, overlooking the Passeig de Gracia, and absorbing the influence that the maker of that roof had on the area.If you're going to take the time to explore the entirety of the property available to the public (people do actually live in the building), be sure to grab one of the portable audio guides to explain many of the ideas behind Gaudi's architectural style. For a more grandiose display of Gaudi's work, I would highly recommend visiting the Park Guell or even the Casa Batllo down the street. As for his work in Barcelona, La Pedrera should be your first stop."

You do however get the audio guide included which I found very interesting. We also got a small discount using vouchers from the Bus Touristic city tour.The roof is the first stop (by lift) which is amazing with all the slopes and turrets plus fantastic views. Below this is quite a good exhibition about Gaudi and his designs. On the 4th floor is an apartment furnished as it was when the house opened around 1906. Two extensive souvenir shops on the way out.The place should definitely be seen, it's like no other house I've visited. Bear in mind it is slightly strenuous clambering over the roof and then working your way down."

While not as breathtaking as La Sagrada Familia, it is well-worth seeing. The insight into life in an earlier time through touring the apartment is very worthwhile and gives an exciting view into the mind of Gaudi and shows how far ahead of others he was for his time. So much of Barcelona is about the architecture and this is an important aspect that is not to be missed. Lastly, while in the area of La Pedrera and Sagrada Familia, be sure to check out the other buildings by Gaudi and his contemporaries. Touring these is a very nice walk if the weather is good."

As others have noted, the entry price to this building is high at \u20ac20.50 so you need to have an interest in the architecture of this period to make it worth the fee. However, if you do have that interest it is a fascinating visit. The building is almost organic in its design.An audio tour handset is included and the tour proper starts at the top on the roof of the building. I understand that if it is raining the roof is closed and I'd certainly recommend postponing your visit if that is the case. The roof not only gives some great views over the city but has some surreal constructions on it ... yes they are functional as chimneys and ventilation but they look like owls, chess pieces, knights in armour ........The tour then continues through the attic with a very well presented exhibition about Gaudi and the building itself. The attic itself is so very organic it almost feels like being inside a great beast. Finally you are taken through a couple of the apartments furnished and decorated to the period. Actually, finally you leave through the gift shop, of course :-)"

The visit starts at ground level in one of the courtyards, but rapidly translates (by lift) to the fantastic roof. This has to be seen to be believed and is what confers world heritage site status.After exploring the roof and its views, the audio tour (included in the 20 euro price) takes you to the attics, with their spectacular brick vaulted roof. Here is a comprehensive exhibition on Gaudi and his many works.This is followed by a visit to one of the appartments (the rest are still occuppied) that has been furnished in the style of the period.How does this compare to other Gaudi properties. Clearly the Segrada Familiar is a world-class must, but as a church difficult to compare. The Palais Guell shows you more interior, and if I was forced to choose only one, I'd go for the Palais. But the Palais is early Gaudi, and La Pedrera is late, and there are lots of differences, so best to do both. Sorry, not (yet) been to the Casa Battlo, so cannot help there.One last thing. For safety reasons, they close the roof if it is raining. And as this is such a big part of the visit, I'd go elsewhere if its raining and come back when it has stopped."

Definitely walk past Casa Batllo. We walked over to La Pedrera late- around 5 o\u2019clock and walked right in without a line. We were disappointed that have the fa\u00e7ade was under scaffolding. Tickets were steep at 20.50 Euros, which includes the audio guide. The guide was helpful. The tour starts in the courtyard and continues with an elevator ride up to the roof terrace. The roof terrace is impressive-there are nice views of Barcelona including one of the Sagrada Familia There are a lot of small few steps on the terrace- and you need to watch where you are walking but the structures are beautiful.After the roof, you head down a few stairs to the attic and also get to see examples of Gaudi\u2019s furniture and then down two flights to a restored apartment.I\u2019d pick one of Gaudi\u2019s work to see \u2013 and this is the one if you have the time and $. It is a great example of Gaudi\u2019s work- and a must see for those into architecture."

My wife and I visited in October and at the time the building was surrounded by scaffolding so there is little to see from the outside. The price to visit was \u20ac20.50 which I felt was very expensive for what it is. It is a similar price to La Sagrada Familia but not even close to being as jaw dropping an experience. While waiting to enter we were encouraged to spend an additional \u20ac3 to jump the queue, but unless it is very busy I would not recommend this option. Once inside you are provided with an audio guide and taken to the roof terrace in a lift. From there you simply walk around at your leisure and key the number into your guide that is indicated by the various displays. The roof terrace is impressive, as was the loft but there was little else to justify the excessive entrance fee. There are plenty of photo opportunities on the roof as many of the landmarks are visible. Definitely worth a visit if you can overlook the hefty entrance fee."

The audio guide was decent but we sometimes had trouble locating the posted numbers to hear the commentary. Highly recommend getting tickets for opening time, 9:00 am. With this, we were the first to enter the building and the first up on the roof to see the amazing forms Gaudi designed to make the chimneys and other unsightly things more pleasing. All alone on the roof of La Pedrera! I ran around like I was on a playground! But take your photos sans crowds fast--it wasn't long before other ticket holders made their way up to the top. It was awesome while it lasted. As you stroll around the roof, each turn presents a new angle on the construction and new views of Barcelona behind it. You'll even see La Sagrada Familia in the distance. The fanciful structures can remind you of Star Wars Storm Troopers at times.The other floors of the house are interesting, including the cave-like attic and some furniture. Although Gaudi's furniture looks uncomfortable, we discovered, by sitting on his benches at Park Guell, quite the opposite! He designed it to mold body parts perfectly, even though that resulted in unusual shapes. We spent a lot of time here--almost two hours. Allow one hour minimum. To note: the gift shop has nice things which we thought we'd see in other souvenir shops but didn't. Therefore, we were pleased to learn that the shop is open to the street as well, allowing us to return another day to buy something without paying to go back through the house.PS: You are likely to visit Casa Batllo the same day as it is just a few yards across the street. Buy that ticket ahead of time on-line as well and it is for a certain day, but no certain time. Therefore, visit Pedrera first, staying as long as you like, and you don't have to worry about leaving for a specific entry time at Batllo."

The combination of going in Casa Mila and walking by Casa Batllo was great for us! Also, my husband and I ordered one audio guide instead of two. This worked out well for us and saved some money. You start on the roof, which is breathtaking. Not only do you see great views of the city, but you also see the architecture and chimneys up close. Truly spectacular! After the roof, you move into the attic. We were amazed as we read and studied the exhibits about Gaudi's work. There were many examples of his work and inspiration, which was very interesting to us. The archways and construction itself were fascinating. From the attic, you can tour an apartment that is setup as living quarters. It was neat to see how a family would have lived during that time."

You cannot do justice from the outside as scaffolding covers much of it, with renovations taking place.The price is a little steep at 20\u20ac but we ended up spending nearly two hours inside!The roof is amazing. Yes it's Gaudi, but you can see up close the functionality of the sculpture and his brilliance. There are impressive rooftop sculptures that can be viewed as one walks around the roof area.The design of the Attic with inverted arches (instead of columns) that support the roof above - the result is a wide-open space, which houses different exhibits.For any students of architecture this must surely be a place to visit. It highlights Gaudi's interest in the natural world which had such an influence over many of his subsequent designsA really interesting building / exhibition, and the self guided audio tour - included with ticket price, is ideal for allowing you to go at your own pace and digest all the information.The building has an apartment as designed and constructed by Gaudi - living quarters, kitchen, children's room, and servant working / living spaces. Below the demonstration apartment, one can see the floors below which contain apartments in use today. A great tour."

The Palau Guell was so much more dramatic and more extensive. One jaw dropping room after another. La Pedrara is just not enough bang for the buck, but still quite a work of art to behold.

You cannot do justice from the outside (the rooftop is not fully visible from outside, you would miss the Attic, and the Apartment). Scaffolding covers much of the outside, with renovations taking place.We decided to see Le Pedrera last minute - we had already pre-bought our tickets for the Sagrada Famili and Parc Guell. The price is a little steep, but we are so glad we listened to the advice of friends. We ended up spending nearly three hours inside!The roof is amazing. Yes it's Gaudi, but you can see up close the functionality of the sculpture and his brilliance. Beneath the rooftop sculptures house the water tower, elevator pulley shafts and roof supports for inverted arches of the Attic one floor below.The design of the Attic with inverted arches (instead of columns) supports the roof above - the result is a wide-open space, which today houses different exhibits.The building has an apartment as designed and constructed by Gaudi - living quarters, kitchen, children's room, maid and servant working and living space. The wood craftsmanship was truly amazing - the cabinets, inlay floors, ceilings.Below the model apartment, one can see the floors below which contain apartments in use today. The building was designed for the new bourgeoisie that were moving into the Eixample neighborhood. Am sure that those living in these marvelous apartments are today's bourgeoisie.Get your tickets in advance (and print them out) - avoid the ticket line."

Also interesting to see the lovely apartment. At the beginning I thought it was less impressive than Casa Battlo but it's just different, more subtle. It's worth seeing as much Gaudi as you can take/afford! The fact that it's a charitable foundation supporting so many good causes cheers you up at the end after forking out the hefty entrance fee."

The staff are incredibly kind and helpful to the frail (I was hobbling around with a walking stick).

I have to rate La Pedrera as a \"tourist attraction,\" and in that context, it doesn't have the impact of Casa Batllo, Palau Guell, or Sagrada Familia--although there is no arguing that it is an architectural marvel. Visitors are well advised to book tickets in advance, first thing in the morning being ideal in order to reduce the crowds, particularly on the rooftop. For that reason, consider spreading out visits to the key Gaudi sites (which we did not, scheduling Casa Batllo, La Pedrera, and Sagrada Familia in one day which had its pros and cons). Had we not been part of a horde by the time we entered La Pedrera at 11 am, my reaction might have been different. The crowds had more of a negative impact on the rooftop experience than on the visit to the apartment. Take time in the apartment to peer through the gauzy curtains to see the the scaffolds outside."

Once we reached the roof, it was as if we had entered another world, a Dr. Seuss-like world that reflected the imagination of an imaginative architect. We wandered around the roof for awhile and could have stayed up there much longer. The exhibits in the attic really help you understand and appreciate Gaudi further.

Be advised that there is only one elevator to go to the 8th floor where the tour actually begins. I had to go up by the stairs, otherwise, the waiting would be an hour, maybe more.

This is a must see in Barcelonia as is the Sagrada Familia if you can bear the long queues and wait!!"

And of course there is the wonderful rooftop with its bizarre chimneys and views of the city. Time and budgetary restraints allowed one Gaudi tour; I'm glad I opted for this one."

I would visit the two buildings on a separate day to fully appreciate Gaudi's hardwork.The reason why I did not feel that I appreciated this experience to the full extent was because we were not given access to many rooms and therefore, I felt that the works we were allowed to see overlapped with that of Casa Batllo.So if you do not have time to visit La Pedrera don't cry over it. You must visit Casa Batllo and La Sagrada Familia though!"

Since a large section of Casa Mila's facade was covered due to construction, we thought that visiting the interior and the famous roof would elevate our moods and give us the full experience. The roof is worth all the fuss; it is interesting to imagine George Lucas in Barcelona gazing at the strangely formed chimneys and finding inspiration for Darth Vader. Of course this wasn't in the audio guide (it should be, shouldn't it?) but the guide is still informative and it's nice to move at your own pace. I really loved the mosaic details and how Gaudi used old champagne bottles to decorate a few of his functional ventilation towers which just proves that every detail has a meaning. The iron gate near the gift shop is also something not to be missed.We arrived relatively early, around 9.30am and the waiting line was not more than 15 minutes. The admission price includes an audio guide and it is rather pricey and other downsides include that everyone gathers at the top on the roof and the tour of the apartments is somewhat uninteresting but it's still a must do for any Gaudi fan like myself."

The roof sculptures all have a purpose masking staircases, chimneys or water tanks for the apartment below. The views are remarkable and you also get a sight of the Sagrada Familia. The apartment block is lived in but one apartment has been opened up to visitors and is fascinating for both its architecture and furnishings. The vaulted area under the roof of the block houses a very interesting Gaudi history with models of many of his buildings. There is a good gift shop on the way out. Don't miss it."

You don't need to print your tickets - all you need to do is give them your name and booking/reference number and they'll print your tickets for you - so easy! We had booked for the 12:30pm visit but we were able to enter around 11:30am after picking up our tickets from the office. The audio guide is free and you learn such interesting facts about Gaudi and his other works as you tour through la Pedrera. After passing through the courtyard (lovely to take pics here!) you can either walk up the spiral stairs to the rooftop terrace (where the tour begins) or you can wait for the elevator. The elevator doesn't take you straight up to the terrace (you still need to walk up two flights) but it does cut down on the amount of walking. The rooftop terrace is so captivating with the chimneys that look like knights from Star Wars. Here you get beautiful views of the Passeig de Gracia, the roof terraces of other apartments, and of Barcelona. Be sure to take pics of La Sagrada Familia! There are lots of steps around the terrace and the roads are winding but fun!The next stop on the tour is in the attic (though dark) with all the arches where you see the architecture of Gaudi's other works and learn where he gets his inspiration from. He's a genius with geometry! When you walk down another two flights of stairs you will arrive in the apartment - be sure to wait for the 5 minute video where you can watch how Barcelona looked and developed between 1905-1929. It's fun to walk through the apartment and see the various rooms (e.g. Servant's quarters, office, living area, dining room, kitchen, child's room). I loved the natural light from the windows. The apartment was so modern for its time and well thought out. Even the door handles are ergonomic!Once you finish viewing the apartment you will arrive at the gift shop where you can buy vintage posters. There are a wide variety of souvenirs here. You can spend close to two hours here! Once again remember to buy your tickets online to avoid the long lineups!"

Later we decided to visit anyhow and discovered vast areas that are still visible, despite the renovations, true to Gaudi style. Inside we were amazed at what Gaudi had created at La Pedrera. Having been to Sagrada Familia, we were aware of his incredible talent. La Pedrera is remarkable on its own though. This was designed for personal living and Gaudi knew how to put his touch here also. Besides the rooftop, which blows one's mind, between the unique chimneys and the view of Barcelona (including Sagrada Familia), one must see the clever ways Gaudi handled the interior design. Whether to view the furniture styles, the flow of rooms or the unmistakable Gaudi colors and tiles, the visitor must see this work! I highly recommend using the audio tour to fully comprehend the tour. Also, I found the gift shop perfect for many authentic gifts and souvenirs."

Most people associate Gaudi with La Sagrada Familia as this is his most famous creation, but La Pedrera is equally if not more impressive - a functioning apartment block built entirely in his beautiful and unique style. You can take a tour across the roof (it is absolutely incredible!), through an exhibition of blue prints, prototypes and other pieces of Gaudi paraphernalia in the attics and also visit some reconstructed apartments, furnished with genuine period pieces. It's a fascinating experience and the audio guide does a wonderful job of explaining the life and times of Gaudi, and why a lot of his choices were made the way they were. Sadly the facade of the building is currently undergoing restorations but for the roof alone it is worth the price of entry."

The exhibition in the loft ( the old wash house ) is a great insight into Gaudi and his inspiration's mainly taken from nature.

There is even a photo opportunity , when you can sit in an archway and be in shot with Gaudi's Sagrada Familia in the background .

An elevator takes you up 6 floors to the large roof area with fascinating chimneys of all kinds with beautiful views of Barcelona. There is a bit of up-and-down and steep/off-angle stairs with fencing so be careful. You then go down one floor to the attic that shows how Gaudi constructed the support for the roof. Here are models and descriptions not only of Casa Mila, but for many of his other buildings. Then go down to the 2nd floor to a Gaudi-period furnished apartment with about 9 rooms where one can get a real sense of living there. Choice of audio tours: 75 minutes detailed or 40 minutes highlights. We took the 75 minute one and enjoyed it immensely. We came 15 minutes prior to opening with online tickets, so the building was not crowded; spent 2 hours. While Casa Battlo is more highly rated in TripAdvisor, both Fodors and Rick Steves prefer Casa Mila over Casa Battlo if you had to pick just one. So choose wisely if you have limited time or money."

You can pay an additional 4 euros for an audio guide but we passed on this and focused on the architecture and enjoyed the trip just as much. The best parts of the building are those outside, the roof terrace and looking up when you initially come in. One floor has the interiors done up in the original style and there is also an exhibition on Gaudi but the real attraction is the building itself. In terms of waiting, the visit involves a wait at the bottom for a lift, which can take a little while and buying tickets on the day involved a short wait. Both were well-worth it."

I was disappointed off right off the bat because the entire exterior of the building was covered in scaffolding. They did print a graphic of the real exterior on the fabric covering but its wasn't even close to seeing the real exterior.The audio tour was good but I lost interest. At the start of your visit you take an elevator to the roof. This was the highlight for me. I really enjoyed the great views of the city and Gaudi's masterpieces on the roof! Then you take the stairs to the attic. Here you see lots of models and info on other Gaudi creations. Then you take more stairs to the apartment. I enjoyed seeing the antiques. I spent the majority of my time on the roof and then skimmed the attic & apartment. I booked my tickets online (paid $29) and booked a specific time to visit. I would highly recommend you do the same. I was able to skip the long ticket line and enter at my allotted time. If you have to chose between Casa Batllo and La Pedrera. I vote for Casa Batllo. If you have time to visit both then great. La Pedrera is worth it just for the roof."

The frontage is closed for restoration, so don't spend time if you don't want to get in (but you surely should go in if you have time, after visiting Casa Batlo, Sagrada Familia and Park Guel). Whenever you go, always buy your tickets online, it's not an exception, you can save a lot of time. It's a great view from the roof, exhibition about different Gaudi works and excursion through one of the flats of the building. I believe that it's the best way to summurize all the experience from other Gaudi works, get known about technics, designing and developing, but if you are short of time, you should better visit casa Batlo or Sagrada Familia. Audioguide, as for me, has too long openings to each sections, so I started it before come to the next point and it was ok."

The main entrance was beautiful, but the tour of an apartment was too warm, overcrowed and not all that interesting. The attic was huge and interesting but the rooftop was our focal point. I would not recommend the rooftop for anyone with disabilities. As you entered the rooftop there was a two foot drop - difficult to see with the blinding lights. There were numerous elevations on the rooftop...it was not a comfortable feeling. No railings or markers to guide you. You had to look for steps with glaring lights in your eyes. I stumbled, along with another person - it was quite a shocking jolt. The cava was served in an open stark white room. We were ready to leave and we were walked to the beautiful entry on the first floor. Gaudi's work priceless - we just felt the tour was expensive and not as enjoyable as we had anticipated. Our tour of Casa Batillo was by far a more enjoyable experience - and should not to be missed!"

Work was in progress on the outside of the building, so it was covered top to bottom with a giant picture of what was behind it. It only slightly detracted from the overall experience, because what was inside was amazing. Gaudi was inspired by nature: so straight lines are rare but the high production and maintenance costs are probably covered by the revenues such a wonderful building generates.We were with two friends. As part of the tour, you enter an elevator which takes you a few floors up to the roof. The building encircles an open space and it is walled, but the inner safety wall is made of toughened glass. It is all perfectly safe as the walkway round the building is about 4 metres wide, but it was at this point my friend and I each discovered the other had an extreme fear of heights. Our wives have no idea what vertigo is and leant over the sides and took some magnificent photos for us. Eventually, my friend shuffled round the walkway, whilst I sat on a step trying to figure out where the exit stairs might be.Actually, I don't want my vertigo to detract from the views as they were quite stunning. We then took the stairs down floor by floor and saw a plan of the building, some original apartments and several pieces of Gaudi designed furniture.The building is extraordinary and really challenges the senses. We arrived in Barcelona on Friday afternoon and left the following Monday morning. We definitely needed at least one more day. The Pedrera should be very high on your list of places to visit in Barcelona."

We purchased tickets on the spot, the line was not too long, and moved very quickly. We also splurged for the guided tour (and I would recommend it) which added some great background facts. Visiting this \"re-furnished apartment suite\" provided a very real look at the unique thought process behind the living space design and their layout. And, the gift shop! .... (and I do love a good gift shop) ...Just a perfect way to end the tour, another beautiful merchandise mix of jewelry, art, books, cards, etc. (I agree with another of the contributor - the exterior was covered for cleaning, which completely hides the grand exterior .. so don't walk past it by mistake). I believe this will be another great Gaudi experience you will truly enjoy!"

Named for its rough exterior which resembles an open quarry this residential project is another wonderful showcase of Gaudi\u2019s inventive designs and illustrates how well ahead of the architectural design of the time he was. It would have been an amazing place to have lived.The facades of the courtyards are an array of colour, light and varied forms. Murals decorate the ceilings and walls of the entrance lobbies and the main staircase, injecting more colour. Plants cascading down from lower balconies also create colour and enhance the sense of openness and nature.There are some great things to explore inside as well. On the fourth floor, an apartment has been recreated, providing an insight into the home and lifestyle of a wealthy family in Barcelona in the 20th century. Following the original layout, the home is filled with furniture and household items of the time. Decorative elements designed by Gaudi also adorn the apartment, such as the window and door handles, moulded to ergonomically fit the hand; doors and flooring.Up in the attic, made up of brick arches, is a tribute to Gaudi\u2019s life and work through scale models and plans, drawings and photographs. It provides interesting insight into Gaudi\u2019s work throughout his lifetime.Perched on top of the building is the roof terrace, filled with a fabulous collection of interesting forms, designed to also fulfil a function, such as chimneys, ventilation shafts and stairwells. Some of these are decorated with shards of broken tile, stone, marble and glass, providing further dimension to these dynamic forms. Affording magnificent views of the modern city of Barcelona, wandering among these fascinating forms offers a nice respite from the bustling streets below. Plan to visit on a fine day as the roof terrace is closed when it is raining.Would definitely recommend booking ticket in advance online, it\u2019s easy to do and you will be pleased when you arrive and can bypass the crowds without a ticket waiting to enter. These queues were quite lengthy when we visited at midday. You can also visit during the evening and see everything lit up which would also offer a great perspective.A camera is set up so you can have your photo taken and super imposed in front of the whole building and purchase the photograph to take home. You can select a few including day and night time photos. As well as hard copy the photos are also available digitally online for you to download. Quite touristy but a great souvenir to take home. It is easy to get to. It is one of the stops for most of the hop on hop off buses. Otherwise a variety of local public transport will get you there. Would definitely recommend a visit."

The exhibits here were very well presented too, and helped explain how the building was constructed. The best part of the visit for me was the apartment, it was beautiful.

Also, if you suffer from vertigo, you want to skip this. You can see most everything in about an hour & 1/2 or two. Nice souvenir shop (a bit pricey as most souvenir shops are that are part of a major tourist attraction, but nice stuff).

Visually you will find movement in the construction and as it's hard to find right angles. The roof is spectacular not only will you get a splendid view of Sagrada Familia and the wonderful skyline of Barcelona but the whimsy and forms of the chimneys and water tanks make for great pictures! Make sure to choose the audio for ultimate immersion into the works of Gaudi."

You wait in line then take a elevator to the roof where you find some interesting chimneys and get a nice view of the city. You can listen to the audio lecture which adds some much needed context. The roof doesn't need more than a few minutes before you start winding yourself down the interior where you are introduced to the background behind the building's development. Although there are some interesting aspects none of them need you to spend much time here. Unless you are an architectural student or Gaudi lover this place is simply not as visually interesting compared to the church or Battlo. If you are pressed for time or simply wanting to prioritize your Gaudi visits make it third on your list or go the park which is free and no waiting in line. Tip: plan to attend between 12 - 2 pm when lines are not as long."

After visiting Sagrada Familia, this place hardly held any interest to us on the face of it, especially when we learnt that this was an apartment complex. We even began the tour (with audio guide) with disinterest. But we were in for a surprise! The tour includes a visit to the roof, the attic and one apartment floor. The floor below the roof, called the attic, was what gave meaning to the building structure and gave insight into Gaudi, his genius, ideas and the way he designed his brilliant structures. We spent over an hour on this floor itself. There was information about other structures that we could not visit on this trip, which made it worthwhile for us, in a way. Recommend the visit, but with a guide to understand the work of the artist and appreciate it better."

The tour leader was excellent but the interiors of this building do not have a WOW factor especially if you have already visited the Casa Battlo, Parc Guell and Sagrada Familia. This is a huge apartment complex, designed by Gaudi. The tour takes you to one of the apartments where Gaudi lived. The rooms are reconstructed and does not match the Gaudi-modernista style. However, the attic is nice and resembles the skeleton of a whale. It used to be a laundry in the past but now it houses an interesting exhibition of a few of the many concepts which Gaudi designed and developed. The roof-terrace has tens of nice features including architectural structures decorated with ceramic fragments. We were given a glass of Cava (the Spanish champagne) and we were allowed a few minutes of free time where we could enjoy the nice views from this roof top. Our ticket included a dinner at the Pedrera restaurant. Unfortunately, the restaurant is not well decorated and looks very bare and dull. We were given a menu which was totally different from the one they had sent us via email. The portions were very small and the food was crappy.TIPS: check if the renovations are ready before visiting. Do not go to Pedrera restaurant."

From the outside, the windows look like something from Phantom of the Opera. The roof, with the clay soldiers and mosaic made from broken champagne bottles, offered an amazing view of Barcelona and, since it was near sunset, was the perfect time to visit. Inside the apartment was also interesting, as they explained different inspiration of nature that recur in Gaudi's designs. Since we visited Sagadra Familia afterwards, this was helpful.

The courtyard at the bottom and the rooftop were the parts worth seeing. It's just great fun walking along the rooftop trying to get quirky photos of the quirky chimneys! On the way back down you are led through rooms which are meant to demonstrate the typical Spanish lifestyle of the era in which Casa Mila was built and inhabited. Not as interesting. As a sidenote, the gift shop has a good selection of English books regarding the history of Spain, Barcelona, etc, which I was really craving (and struggling to find elsewhere) by this point of my trip!!"

We did not know beforehand that the building was under construction, so I was quite disappointed not being able to take photo's of the exterior (they have a huge billboard covering the entire building with a photograph of the building on it). We had also been sightseeing and shopping beforehand, so we kept up the entire line of people waiting to enter as we had bought two jamon knives and had some fruit in one of our backpacks. The security guard could not speak English at all and kept pointing towards her screen showing the content of our bags, but would not allow us behind her counter to understand what exactly she was so upset about. In the end we left the knives with her and were allowed to enter with our backpack containing a small bag of cherries. The design of the chimneys entices the imagination, but the amount of fire escapes, construction gates and fencing on the roof does little for an authentic experience. The apartment was probably the most interesting and is what I remember fondly when I think back on the visit. It is built in a circular form and every room is decorated with historical pieces. The walk through the attic is also informative. My kids ( 12 and 14 yrs old) were not too excited about this visit once completed.

There are three areas for visit: (1) rooftop was nice, wasn't spectacular, (2) attic with video exhibition and models on display, was interesting, (3) one home unit showcasing how the house would have looked like in the olden days, was alright. Paid an extra 4 euros for an audio guide. I chose to liten t the long version that lasts 75min (short version takes 20min). To be frank, it was one of the least worthwhile audio guide. Most info could have been learnt online before the visit. The exhibition on the attic floor was quite well explained on itself the audio guide did not add too much value. Being one of Gaudi's famous work that's completed and still in functional use, it is worth a visit if you can spare the 16.5 euros. Otherwise, to see Gaudi's work, you can take advantage of the free entry to Parka Guell after 9:30pm (in summer it's still bright then)."

It is conveniently located on the Passeig de Gracia, and you can tour it in an hour or less. First they send you to the roof, which has those soldiers you see in all the gift shops (look like Lord of the Rings), and wonderful undulating surfaces. Then you descend to a museum in the \"attic,\" where there are lots of displays and audiovisuals -- spend as much or as little time as you like. Then you go down another floor to an apartment that gives an interesting perspective on what it would have been like to live in that building during the early to mid 20th century.There is an elevator that takes you to the roof, and then most visitors descend via the stairs. However, I saw some people going down on the elevator, so if stairs don't work for you, just speak to them at the entrance."

As it turned out,Casa Mila was shrouded with safety nets while being repaired or painted. So we went to Casa Batllo. You can go in the lobby of the Casa Mila at no charge and see the atrium. It's worth a one block walk and ten minutes of your time."

After our visit we decided to go again the next year, and this time to the special night opening to casa Mila. After all, Gaudi brought us here so we couldnt miss La Pedrera! We were looking forward to see this! Special holograms, small groups, and a glass of cava. A complete night out! It costs a lot more than the normal tour, but hey, with all the extras it must be worth it! And this is a one time experience, so lets go for it.When we went to get the tickets there was a very nice woman who helpt us buy the tickets. We were really looking forward to this special night out!Friday we went to 'The Secret Pedrera' at night. The things the guide was telling were really interesting. The building is very beautiful, the inside was even more spectacular than the outside! We took nice pictures and saw the building. Still we have a bad feeling about this tour. The whole time i was feeling I was in a hurry to see everything. There was a big group of people (+/- 30) who wanted to see everything. When I think of a small group this is not what I imagined. I couldn't see what the woman was talking about half of the time and the guide was constantly getting people who were left behind. This caused there to be less time for her telling stories.The guide also was constantly rushing us thought the building. Why If I pay half, I get to stay as long as I want, and with this \"special night\" I'm getting rushed?The special holograms (the s at the end means more than one) were not really visible because of the large group. Also I only saw one..? Another disappointment.Then when we came down from the roof, after being rushed around the statues on top of the roof, we went to get our glass of cava. But first I wanted to tell my experiences to the woman who helped us buy the tickets. I went to her to tell the way I felt, because I had the feeling she really cared about this building and the tour. After I told my story i went down to my girlfriend to drink the glass of cava at the end of our visit, like it was written in the flyer. My girlfriend than told me she had to drink a juice because there was no more cava. I couldn't believe it. When I went to get something to drink the men told me that there was no more. I was shocked.. Are you out of cava, is the group so big that they drank it all? What do you mean, there is no more??What was supposed to be the best night out of our holiday was a big disappointment. The things that were promised in the brochure weren't there. Not even the easiest promise, a glass of cava. I feel mislead and I feel I have paid way to much for this all. After all, all of things I paid extra for weren't there. No small groups, no hologramS, no glass of cava and as a bonus a bad night.Before I would have told everybody to go to La Pedrera, in fact, we did. Now we won't do it, we'll send them somewhere else.."

I wonder why the covering is not a picture of what is behind it so at least you can get the idea that the Guadi building is there. We got there just as the night tour started. The tour guide did a good job of explaining the history of the building and some of the changes. Hard to believe that 3 of the apartments are still being rented. They say after this generation of renters, all will be empty and the whole place made a museum. I think that is a good idea. They offer you the lift or you can climb the 6 flights of stairs to the top floor where they have set up some of the apartments back when the place was built. Obviously for the well to do folks. Next you take stairs to attic which is very large with some good history. Since it was the night tour some of the areas I the attic had the lights off so we couldn't see those areas. I think they should have allowed it. We the went to the roof which is a great sight to see, especially at night. They did have a small light show on one of the towers but it was less interesting than the other views from the roof. Down at the bottom, they had a small dessert and glass of champagne. With only 3 units occupied, I think that more could be seen? This place does not have the same flair as Casa Batllo so I would chose that one if given a choice. But I think they could make it as good if they change a few things about the tours. Day or night, if you like Guadi, you will still like looking around."

It was definitely worth it. If you're a Gaudi fan (and it is possible to be over 'Gaudi-ed' in Barcelona) this is a must. The exterior facade is currently being renovated but that doesn't detract from the stunning interior. The courtyard is beautifully painted and upstairs there is a lovely apartment to see which is in original condition. The views from the roof are incredible at night too. Two things to remember if you do this evening tour, first is that you have to go up four floors to see the apartment and then more stairs up to the roof. There is a lift, but getting into it can be a bit of a scramble. And the second, once on the roof, it's floodlit with lamps that are placed low to the ground. These can be rather dazzling and there are lots of steps it would be easy to miss. The glass of cava at the end was nice. If you're planning to eat after your visit, don't forget to check what time your chosen restaurant closes"

This is known as the quarry because it looks like one. The exterior right now is under renovation so you cant really see it, but inside, its a masterpiece. Quite pricey for the entrance fee, but it is worth it. Gaudi loves nature and thought that it is perfect, so all of his designs were inspired by nature. He also doesnt like replicating, so even the columns of the building are unique from each other. From the rooms to the walls, to the columns to the attic of the apartment, Gaudi's true genius is clearly shown."

You can book online and save the wait and avoid the line.That said, this is (next to Sagrada Fam\u00edlia), one of Gaudi's truly fascinating works. The rooftop alone is worth the price of admission. The museum is a little boring unless you are a true Gaudi fan. The apartments are either equally as interesting, or equally as boring. Again, depends upon your level of appreciation for Gaudi.In you have read my other reviews of Barcelona, you may be getting the impression that unless you are a true Gaudi aficionado, Barcelona will leave you a bit underwhelmed. That is true. If you couldn't care less about Gaudi, make Barcelona a day trip and check it off your bucket list."

We had difficulty finding this building because our guide books called it, \"Casa Mila\" Every local we asked said they had no idea what we were looking for and we walked past it because the the outside was obscured by scaffolding and fabric. So- if you are lost- be sure to ask locals for \"La Pedrera\" The line was short and everyone commented about having a hard time finding the building. We enjoyed being inside and seeing Gaudi's creation as well as scale models, plans, drawings, photos, and videos. It gave us insight into the fundamental aspects of his architecture. Unfortunately the roof was closed because it was a rainy day. We could catch a glimpse through a few windows but would have loved to be out there exploring it.

OK, the entire building was covered in scaffoldings and tarps (May 2014), but I was still looking forward to what is being announced as one of Gaudi's Masterpieces. At the end of the day, you access coutryards, the roof, the attic with its Gaudi Museum and an appartment done up \"as it was\" in the 1920. At the end of the day, you don't have access to most of the building, and it's rather disappointing.Even more so when, even though you've booked your ticket in advance for opening time, you still have to queue to get in, pay extra to get an audioguide, and then wait for the lift that will take you to the rooftop...If you're lucky, you'll have to wait for 10 minutes as the lift only carries 9 people, but if you're stuck behind a coachload of American seniors, you could be there for 25 minutes.Once on the fabulous rooftops and its famous chimneys, you'll have to find a way to avoid having tourists in the way if you want to take pictures.Fortunately, things improve when you go one level down to the attic, mostly because most of the tourists don't really care about the Gaudi Museum. This is probably the most interesting part of the visit.And then you get to the 1920s appartment, which once again, is very disappointing if you're there to see some Gaudi architecture.There is another courtyard and a temporary exhibit area with some interesting features, but to be frank, better spend your time and money at Casa Batllo or Palau Guell."

I must admit that the architectural style is more than unusual, but its functionality came through clearly. I reversed my opinion and ended up appreciating the creative and novel use of space. That is, if you can get over the cartoonish and somewhat nightmarish facade.  The queue for entry was acceptable, only ten minutes. We got the recorded tour, which was very good. The ride up to the roof might be stressful for some, as its a small elevator and crammed. You start of the roof and walk down thru the attic and the residential apartment, each with rooms and displays which present a complete picture of the structure."

The exterior is covered and will be for some months for renovation but do not let that detract you from going for a tour of the interior. It is a house that is lived in by the locals but a couple of levels are retained for the tourists to visit. The history is interesting and some of the andecotes are great i.e. the glass bottles after the first night party.It is a nice slower pace that can take you out from the heat and bustle of the big city for a couple of hours.The secret tour at night is a particularly enjoyed experience."

The house was completed in 1910 however the live-style of the owner reflected in the architectural design that Gaudi created for him. Time had changed and much of the functions within the house does not cater to present day needs. Looking back the beauty and the efficiency of the house created by Gaudi is magnificent. Do give the place at least 2-3 hours to study the creation of the architect and his thought behind it."

As an artist I greatly enjoyed seeing the added under water frescoes in the main entry area, although I know Gaudi did not favor such post construction decor. It gives a languid underwater feel to the area at night, is tastefully done and in keeping with the naturalistic style of Gaudi.The lighted roof area of course is the show stopper. Well worth the ticket price for an up close uncrowded view , a glass of cava at the end and a relaxed viewing with a live guide."

It costs slightly more than usual but you avoid the crowd and the play of light and shadows in this seemingly organic building makes it worth every penny. The building is very stylishly decorated and the lighting makes every bend and nook and corner come alive. This was a guided tour and the lady was very well versed and knowledgeable. The best part I would say is the terrace and and entire floor shaped like a whale's rib cage. The light and music show on display is amazing and from the terrace on a clear night, you can see the temple at Tibidabo glowing in a bright yellow light and Barcelona passing by on Gracia road beneath. Truly amazing experience and very highly recommended."

We went to the Segrada Familia the day before we visited La Pedrera, and yes, the SF is much more impressive, but we were delighted with the apartment house. And yes, work was being done on the exterior, and yes it costs 16,50\u20ac for a ticket (plus 4\u20ac for the audiophone ) which is around $28-29 US. It was worth it. We pay that amount in NYC to see one of the Museums or homes after all. Buy your tickets on line in advance. We chose 10 on a Sunday morning (opening time) and there were very few people. They send you to the roof first. We walked around it to get a feeling and for the views. Then we went down into the attic. Many people rushed through. It was our favorite part of the building and not just for the arches. There is tons of information on the materials and building techniques--way out there for the early 1900's and a presager of some of the techniques used in the SF. There are comfortable little seats to sit on and several places to listen to the audiophone (which we found indispensable!) we were intrigued by how Gaudi hung his models upside down and tested load bearing, well before computer models. None of the interior walls are load bearing, so this building could meet various family needs. There was even a garage.I enjoyed the apartment portion, my husband less so. It is easy to get caught up in the period pieces but take some time looking at the leaf motifs on the floor tiles, the curves in the door frames, the door knobs, the lighting. This is no dark Victorian era home.Staff was helpful offering elevator help so people did not have to climb as many steps"

We booked online and went first thing in the morning (first inside) and rushed immediately for the roof. We had 15 to 30 minutes to take all our pictures on an (almost) empty roof, which was great. Then, we got back to the beginning and restarted the visit.First thing to know, the booking process is the same than the Sagrada Familia, the Palau G\u00fcell or the Parc G\u00fcell, you have to book online and choose a precise time frame. There's little chance you'll just walk in and get a ticket for now, plus the queues are long and in the middle of the construction work noise. Next thing to know, for the outrageous price of 16.50\u20ac per person, the audio-guide is not included. You have to pay 4\u20ac more for it. If you're like us and think they are out of their mind, just do the whole tour without watching anything, and when you reach the end, grab one of the audio-guides left by previous visitors. It's not honest, but they started it.Overall impression is quite mixed, the roof is amazingly strange and picturesque, we stayed there for probably an hour in total. So many things to look at. The rest of the visit is disappointing. The recreation of a golden era apartment feels fake and forced and more than anything, uninteresting. You also have to suffer though yet another small museum dedicated to Gaudi, its life and death. I say 'suffer through' because if you did any other Gaudi building before, then you've already seen it. Then, you walk down a gazillion stairs passing by every floor of the house that you can't visit and that's already the end. They force you through not one but two boring and overpriced souvenir shops and off you go.Overall, a deception. Outrageous price for a roof visit."

You also must pay attention to where you step when you are on the roof because there are \"short steps\" and you could easily mistake it for a full step and twist your ankle. This is not even \"high season\" for tourism and Barcelona is not prepared for the crowds. They have so many guides working at these attractions but they trip over themselves instead of providing any assistance to the traveler!

The group was small so you had lots of room to explore the building and the little touches and stories by the tour guide really added to the occasion. The tour ended with a glass of (very nice!) cava and a few nibbles which was a nice touch. We booked our tickets online, we unfortunately did one of the tour busses the next day which had a voucher for half price entry to the secret tour but did not grudge paying full price for this.Would also recommend visiting the cafe next door afterwards for a few cocktails or a glass of Sangria."

Just come back from a hour and a half tour of La Pedrera by night, the group was around 30 in number but the entire experience was fantastic.The tours are organised by language, and the tour guide was excellent with lots of knowledge, a great sense of humour and happy to answer any questions.You end up with a complimentary glass of Cava, and some fantastic memories and pictures. The rooftop really is something else at night, and the experience is so much better with a smaller group and not hundreds of tourists!The best Guadi experience of Barcelona, even with the exterior facade being restored and covered in scaffolding! You need to prebook, as they were turning people away at the door!"

It's quirky. It would not get past planning laws in most country's in 2014! As an attraction it is a lot briefer than it looks as you start on the ground floor, very quickly end up on the mad roof top where you will spend most of your time, then you meander through the typical museum reading info board bit before finally find the apartment section. It's amazing to see into the mind of architect and his creativity, even down to the door handles and coat hooks.But for nearly 17 euros and were out after just over an hour? All I will say it did help me decide on whether I should pay to go inside every other building he had a hand in that I could see. Yes it's good to get a feel for Gaudi and see some quirky stuff but unless you are absolutely enthused by it then go and take pictures of the outside of the others, but don't bother going in. Apart from the Sagrada Familia. Just do a bit of reading on his other attractions on TA and choose one.And don't do this one if it is raining, as the roof would not be that much fun!"

A self guided tour allowed you to move at your own pace, and once inside the crowds seemed less. the building features many of the stylistic features seen elsewhere, e.g. inspiration from nature, no straight lines and mosaic decorations. It gives you a better understanding of Gaudi and his times. We shared an audio guide which helped enormously.See this before the La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia or you might be disappointed."

I preferred Casa Batllo but others in my family preferred La Pedrera (Casa Mila). They are very different buildings. Casa Batllo is a rich person's home whilst La Pedrera is an appartment 'block'. Quite a contrast but the roof of La Pedera is Gaudi at his most excentric with wonderful wavy chimneys and adornnments. When we visited the exterior of La Pedrera was covered in scaffolding and masked from view which was a shame - I know buildings require upkeep and maintenance but I imagine it will be many months before it is on public display again - worth checking progress before you visit."

There is a little museum inside which houses some furniture and the original architectural designs of some of Gaudi's most recognisable works - including Sagrada Familia. You get to vista an actual apartment, which is a treat in itself. You start from the top and work your way down. The benefit of this is that you do not have to walk up the stairs!

We had our bags scanned as a security measure but this was very quick and easy.A lift is taken to the roof top where we spent a long time admiring the views across the city along with the amazing architecture on the top of the building. Take care to watch where you are stepping, it is easy to trip when not looking where you are going! After the roof top you go to visit the attic space, again very interesting in its own right. There is a exhibition of Gaudi work with some beautiful examples. The actual attic space is fabulous in its own right. From the attic you go down to an example of an apartment, very well set out which gets you thinking of life back then....... On this floor is a opportunity to have your photo taken against a green screen and on leaving you can view your picture and decide if you want to purchase. The background is a great view of the house with your picture super imposed on it. We were with a group of friends and we shared the cost of this, only 14 euros for 4 photos in a presentation folder!On the way out is the obligatory gift shop with something for everyone!Well worth the entrance fee and very good value for money, if you visit you will not be disappointed................"

There's a danger that coming here after Casa Batllo, Sagrada Familia, the Palau de Musica and Casa Lleo Morera that Casa Mila will seem a little plain by comparison. It was a pity that the facade was covered by scaffolding and it was a pity that the grand staircase in the courtyard was blocked with a wooden barrier. I wish that we had booked the evening visit as I think the place would have looked amazing all lit up. The roof is amazing and offers terrific views across the city. The apartment is interesting if a little plain and the museum is interesting too.Its definitely worth a visit but maybe best near the start of your trip and before the other, more colorful sites."

However it is on all different levels with two or three steps going up and down every few yards. There are plenty of warning signs. I have eye sight problems and although I was aware that the roof was pretty lethal for me, I did lose concentration while framing a shot, missed one of the steps and have massive bruises to show for it. Entirely my own fault! So do take care. The apartment was a fascinating insight into life at that time."

Located a short walk from his other apartments, Casa Batllo (which in my opinion are the better apartments), the main and most widely publicised features here are located on the rooftop. Roof top vents/chimneys that would ordinarily not be given design thought are treated with the same respect and design time as the apartment interiors. On the interior roof space is an informative exhibition of Gaudi's design work for this apartment complex. If you want to spend sometime on the rooftop taking in the surrounding views, make sure to pack a hat and sunglasses as there is no shading from nearby buildings. To avoid the queues downstairs, you can preorder and print tickets online."

With this and other Gaudi buildings at the Park Guell, I was disappointed and dismayed to a degree with the actual windows / frames that had obviously been fitted during previous renovations as they were too modern and not in keeping with the style and spirit of the buildings. Surely something more fitting could have been crafted ?Overall I was disappinted with this building and felt it was not worth the EUR 16.50 I paid to get inside."

There is much freedom here and a chance to photograph and see at first hand, how a wealthy family lived inside this extraordinary residence. Visitors are taken upward to the loft, where there are examples of Gaudi's furniture and display cases, featuring some of the inspiration behind his ideas, all explained in detail by the guide.

Overall, I would not recommend visiting either of the houses unless you are a true Gaudi fan or are traveling on a generous budget. The Sagrada Familia is equally expensive but gives you the same taste of Gaudi style and, with its breathtaking interior, provides a much more fulfilling experience to the passing tourist with an amateur appreciation of Gaudi's work. During our visit to Barcelona, we did some extensive research about whether Gaudi's two houses (Casa Mila and Casa Batlo) were worth visiting. We decided to visit only Casa Mila because it had a slightly cheaper admission fee and had the beautiful rooftop and might be better for snapping photos. We went in November when there was not much of a line and paid the discounted price (~15 euros, available to students or Hop On Hop Off Bus ticket holders). We did not get the audioguide as it cost extra, but it would have been nice to have some sort of guide explaining about Gaudi's inspiration and specific work on Casa Mila. There's a guard standing in front of the elevator who lets a few people up to the rooftop at a time - it was not crowded at all, so we were able to stay on the rooftop as long as we wanted. It's really stunning and is exactly what you see in photos online, only with some other fellow admirers wandering in the background. The rooms were less impressive, as we were mainly interested in admiring the architecture. We spent about an hour total in Casa Mila, which was ample time to take plenty of photos and see everything."

All the rooms are forbidden to touch, but they are all opened: the bathrooms, the kitchen, the living room, the terrace ir awesome because you have an awesome view to the city, a panoramic view. And then it as a courtyard inside the building to hangout! It as also an exposition inside, just when you enter the building, about the house, the inicial building, models of the original furniture and everything. It has also those phones to hear the explanation of the visit in several languages. Anyway, you have to visit, it\u00b4s like an hour of visiting or more if you are very curious like me! At first i thought it was very expensive, but after i got in, it was totally worth it!"

Attic and roof are stunning.Almost hard to believe its the same architect from Casa Batll\u00f3, Palau Guell and Sagrada Famila. It seems so plain in comparison. It's a shame that you can't see more of it and that what you can see is limited to one flat, the attic,roof space, replica furniture and the gift shop. Good audio guide, but you had to pay extra for it. Could imagine a night time viewing would be magical, especially if you could take in one of their concerts. It felt very commercial in comparison to Palau Guell, mainly as the gift shop was so large compared to what you could see.Can recommend the cafe/restaurant in the bottom of the building too (you can go here without visiting the house and it indicates the style of the house inside)."

If you made it to Barcelona then it would be criminal not to make it to here. The gift shop has some great books and you can finish in their coffee shop with a lovely coffee or wine! Enjoy!"

La Pedrera is a very interesting place from the chimneys on the terrace which are awesome to the beautifully stunning vaulted attic room. What strikes you is the design and visual impact as soon as you step into the place. You can see an apartment as laid out in the era, including the kitchen bedrooms, bathrooms and reception rooms. Worth a visit and it cost 16.50 euros per adult. That does NOT include the audio guide that is 4 euros - other sights the cost is included so be prepared to pay extra if you want an audio guide. We didn't pay extra and got along fine....This attraction has too many stairs but does have a lift by the way."

We waited 20 minutes to get into the House and were pleased to have done so. The audio guide is a must. The tour is split into three parts: the rooftop with the curious chimneys, the attic (an informative look at Gaudi the architect who was heavily influenced by nature) and then the museum.

Benefits of the evening tour - the roof is especially dramatic at night, it's nice to tour the building in a far smaller group & with less children running around, & who can resist a complimentary glass of Cava & treats at the end?! The tour guide was also very sweet. The only downside is a reenactment that's pretty hokey, but we all laughed it off. Note that there are steps (especially on the roof) & they can be a bit tricky if you either have problems walking or poor night vision."

Be sure to pay the extra for the headphones so you can learn all you need to know to truly appreciate his design work. And make sure you stop in the gift shop! My husband treated me to a pair of fanastically beautiful earrings in the Gaudi style which I will cherish forever.

Different to both Palau Guell and Casa Batllo, the spaces are set up as the original apartments may have looked, with furniture and utensils just like someone had walked out the door to go to the markets for provisions. This gives the space a homey feel and gives the Gaudi aesthetic for form and function greater significance as you get a strong sense of how the space was actually lived in. Perhaps I just like interior spaces, as I was also very taken with the dolls house in the child's bedroom!"

To continue with our visit to Barcelona, it was sure to happen, to see the famous house, that is, Mila House(Casa Mila), better known as La Pedrera. This fascinating, so unusual, extraordinary building was designed also by Antonio Gaudi as the Basilica Sagrada Familia. The famous architect was working on this chef d'oeuvre from 1906 to 1912 year. The building is located at the corner of the Carrer de Provenca and the Passeig de Gracia. You can get to this magnificenthouse, without any problem, just walking from the Placa de Catalunya, along the street Passeig de Gracia in direction to the northwest or from Basilica Sagrada Familia, along the street Carrer de Provenca, in direction to the southwest.It is widespread known as a very controversial design, at the times, when it was built, but also even nowadays,it captivates with its bold forms of the undulating stone facade and wrought iron decoration of the balconies and windows. So there is no wonder, that You have the long queues during the day, throughout the week, of the visitors, who strongly desire to look at this miracle, both outside and inside. In the building, You can observe the plaster ceilings, the construction of underground car parking and separate lifts and stairs for the owners. From the outside, architecturally, it is a completely innovative work for its steel structure and so called, curtain walls, that is in fact self-supporting facade.Beside of this previous told, there is a furniture, that is done in modernist way, after the design of Gaudi.We stayed amazed, after the perceiving all the building,and decided to see it one more time, when we visit Barcelona next time."

They weren't cheap, but I am so glad we did! What a brilliant experience. The atmosphere was wonderful, the music was brilliant (and i'm not a jazz fan particularly). You get a free glass of cava (or orange juice) on arrival with a truffle (yum yum). The only thing I would say is do not be expecting chairs or a formal layout. You literally sit on the steps all around the rooftop. People with mobility issues may want to bear that in mind or make enquiries with the front desk, as they may provide them on request? It was nice to see the skyline at night, and Gaudi's roof all lit up with spot lights. My advice take a camera that is good in low light, as if you keep using a flash you will ruin this very intimate experience. Dress code was a mixture. Some people dressed up (us included) and some were more relaxed. No one really cared, it was very relaxed, with some people laying on the floor with their eyes closed enjoying the music. The band were interactive and amusing. It was also nice to hear the various other concerts and events going on around the city. The whole evening had a real buzz about it, I would definitely go again."

Furthermore, as a mom, I think I would find it nerve wracking to have my children running around on the roof. Some of the stairs are sort of steep.  What you get to see is a 100 year old apartment set up as a bourgeois family of the turn of the last century might have lived. You have access to the attic that has 270 brick arches. The attic serves as a sort of educational site. There is a video running that provides information on Gaudi. There are also little architectural models of his work and displays of his methodologies. I personally loved the models and inspirational explanations. Of course the big attraction is the roof. I also loved the roof. They have set up fences to insure that people stay on a set course. So, if your children are preteen, they will love the experience. The views are great and the functional sculpture is surreal. The dairy queen twists covered in white broken tile shards are delightful. The sculpture that looks like storm troopers or the large sculpture with holes. . .well. . .you're just boggled. You love them and you attempt to figure out how in the world did this enter this man's head so long ago. And how did he get others to understand and create his vision. How did he bring along craftsman to do something so far out, so far from the norm. Amazing."

We spent over an hour touring the building: the courtyards, the roof terrace, the apartment, and the attic which houses an exhibition of Gaudi\u2019s life and work, as well as models of his architectural works, etc. The apartment is set up with each room containing beautiful period furniture, parquet floors, statuary, vases, and vintage items like a gramophone, early telephone, children\u2019s toys, etc. For me, an hour was plenty. I know that this building is a unique and exciting work of art. Still, so much of Barcelona\u2019s economy seems to be focused on Gaudi, that I think I was oversaturated with that focus. The admission was 33 Euros ($45) for us both, which I thought was a bit high. This attraction is fabulous and for those interested in Gaudi and in architecture, it is a must see. My wife enjoyed our time there more than me. For more casual visitors, like me, a few snapshots from outside the building might suffice."

Being 7months pregnant, all the lines & walking of travel were getting tiring. At Casa Mila, they retrieved me & my husband from the line & took us straight to the front. They also offered extra elevator rides since the tour is on multiple levels (you usually just get one to the top & work your way down, but staff caught me at each point & put me on the elevator). I didn't receive special treatment anywhere else on our trip & was very grateful for their kindness."

Our young female guide was very good.This is a huge building - a palace really. There are many Gaudi touches - the curved surfaces, the customised handles, the inner courtyards. The detail is fabulous and the theme of the sea is echoed in doors, in doorframes, in curving handrails on staircases and in wavy plasterwork on the ceilings.What makes the building spectacular is its roof and the many structures on there, for venting air or for storing and releasing water. The roof also provides a great view of the city, though that is hard to photograph by night.There is also an option to have a meal in the restaurant on the first floor, as a package. Given that the visit at night alone is 30 euros per adult, the addition of a very good 3-course meal in a lovely venue, for 19 euros per person, is worth considering. Allow 90 minutes for this.

Anyway - when actually touring the building... prepare to wait in line for a bit outside before being allowed to enter. There is very little to read through about the structures and the architecture, so if you can download a podcast tour guide or visual tour guide beforehand, it's probably a good idea.

The latter is furnished from the period and is insightful but lacks somewhat in authenticity. The kitchen and bathrooms are noteworthy.

We had no intention of visiting, but Gaudi's Caso Batlo down the street was closed for the day, so we walked back and stood in line for a good 45 minutes to enter. If you plan on touring, buy tickets online as those with tickets were allowed inside immediately. One good thing about the line is they wait for people to exit, insuring you will not be overcrowded inside. We went straight to the roof since it was cloudy and a sigh stated they would close the roof without refund if it rained. It was amazing, but I did resent crowds of young adults that seemed to camp out in areas while playing video games. It seemed as though they had camped there all day. It ruined picture opportunities and though there were staff in place throughout, they did nothing to move these kids along. Keep in mind there was a long line of people waiting to get in. The views from the roof were amazing of the city and the cooling breeze was welcome. Next was the attic. More of a museum and the building features were amazing. You could spend a lot of time there, reading and watching film footage of Gaudi. Next was the furnished apartment to visit. It was a great building, but the entrance fee was high in my opinion at 16 euro without headset. Though I did spend money is worse ways while in Europe. Like 6.50 euro to enter a museum only to use the bathroom. Casa Milla is easy to find from the metro or HOHO bus, and in an area you will want to spend some time walking around."

It looked normal, like any rich family's apartment would have looked during that period...It's probably better to go here first."

La Pedrera is clearly one of the must-see Gaudi destinations in Barcelona and has many virtues - the scale of this residential project, and the dramatic roof with its trademark pinnacles, followed by the structural essay in the attic with its slim catenary arches and Gaudi films and exhibits, and lastly the top floor period flat without right-angled corners and Gaudi's d\u00e9cor and furniture. The balcony ironwork is another Gaudi characteristic. However, it did not quite do it for us in the way that Casa Batllo did. There is overall external coherence (at least as Gaudi saw it) but it's harder to get the measure of the complex interior, which is bypassed in an enclosed small lift from the ground floor. We may also have been influenced by an imminent heavy rainstorm which darkened and flattened the light on the roof, severely limiting its photographic value, before driving us down to the attic. But that was just our misfortune. Go there and judge it for yourself. It's impossible to come away in a neutral frame of mind."

The roof alone is a work of art, but I would prefer the attic, created to have air movement and dry up clothing.Just couple of details, at the beggining most of the building was dedicated to appartment rental, with smaller appartments having 400 sqm. One column had to be modified in the basement (that acted as parking, one of the first in the city) to allow entering the Rolls Royce of one of the tenants.The location is also fantastic, in the middle of the most beautiful part of the city and very good restaurants around."

Note the view of the Sagrada Familia blocks away and look down on the Passeig de Gracia. The attic is held up by ingenius brick arches, used as exhibition space all about the Pedrera. You next descend to a sample apartment as of a century ago. They give a good impression of the latest creature comforts of that era.

So don't wait until the allotted time to go in - the same with the towers at Sagrada Familia.The restaurant downstairs (accessible from the street) has good food but the service isn't the best."

Although you can book tickets online, I had no trouble getting in - I was literally only waiting in the queue for about 5 minutes before I got in.One of the most amazing things about the building is that absolutely nothing about it is 90 degrees - it is very fluid-looking if that makes any sense? Although this is evident from the outside, it is even more prominent whilst inside and, in particular, whilst exploring the rooftop terrace, which has a number of interesting sculptures (many of which resembled aliens) and was was probably my favourite part of the building! After exploring the rooftop, make your way downstairs, starting off in the attic rooms which used to be the servant quarters, but is now a museum with short documentaries on a projection screen, scale models of the building and various other exhibits to explain the design of La Pedrera.From the attic, you venture further downstairs into the wealthier living quarters which remains established like it used to be while the building was inhabited by the Mila family. The rooms are not only interesting to explore, but provide an insight to how the other half lived!Overall, this building is definitely worth a visit! Two hours is sufficient enough and, as it is located quite close to the Sagrada Familia, it would be a good idea to fit both of these into the same day!Tip: Whilst exploring the attic, I really regretted not paying extra for the headphones and audio-tour (it was 16.50 euros to get in and another 5 for headphones). A written history is virtually non-existent inside the building, so I would advise everyone thinking of visiting La Pedrera to pay the extra for headphones - not having them really spoiled it for me!"

The arches in the attic are a smaller example of what is repeated on a grand scale in the La Sagrade Familia. This tour combined with a visit to Casa Batllo gives one a full sense of Gaudi's vision."

The ticket entry also includes a great little exhibition about Gaudi's life and work; not comprehensive but certainly a good introduction. You then get access to a model apartment which is, again, very interesting to look round, putting Gaudi within his context. There's also examples of Gaudi's design which are engaging because due to his primary significance as an architect this side of his work is often neglected. The entrance is a bit steep at around 20 euros if you want an audioguide (which I would recommend) but if you can afford it I'd go for it."

The chimneys were made of unique and differing materials. The four together were my favourites. Then we moved into the attic and enjoyed the multimedia presentations about Gaudi and his theories on using parabolic arches etc. Then on to the apartment which was very well presented.

By the time we visited La Pedrera, we were as it is awestruck by Gaudi's genius. We thought no matter what we need an audio guide, and we thoroughly enjoyed it.The house showcases apartments of Upper class of those days, you will be amazed to see the emphasis paid on the details.I felt the entry ticket is little overpriced, but we had already seen so much of Gaudi's work that me and my husband had completely become Gaudi fans, so we really did not want to skip La Pedrera.Just a few suggestions that might help make your visit more fun:1. This is more crowded that Casa Batllo, we had to wait in the queue for 15 mins, which we didn't mind much. So, if 15-20 mins is ok for you, don't bother much about buying tickets online.2. Use the discount coupons (that you get from Bus Touristic or other places) when buying tickets.3. Please please get an audio guide, experience really will be much less fun otherwise.4. The staff might ask you if you would like to have a picture clicked, which they will later frame and give you for 10 Euros. We got one, it was cute :)5. If you have to choose between Casa Mila and Casa Batllo, I suggest please don't because they are both very different just like Sagrada Familia and other cathedrals are different. But if I really had to choose, I would go for Casa Batllo.6. Audio guides cost the same, irrespective of the shorter or longer versions. So wherever you think you want to hear some more information about a certain section, select the number printed in red.Have a good visit !"

I honestly enjoyed touring La Pedrera more than the Sagrada Familia. I wouldn't take the tour if there was rain, as the roof is the best part, and don't forget your camera."

One of the best Gaudi sites, and possibly my favourite one (even more so than the Sagrada Familia, as this felt more personal and more specifically his, rather than designed by an army of lieutenants working to his direction). Lovely to see a real building designed by him, and to get a feel for what it was like to live in - couldn't really get that with the Palau Guell, as that was built as a mansion for his rich benefactor, so I couldn't really \"identify\" with living in it. The apartment in La Pedrera was more \"me\" though.As you wander around (with an audio guide if you want for an additional charge) you get to see the sweeping courtyard, a big and informative exhibition of all of Gaudi's works (explaining everything from the Batllo rework to the shape of the hyperbolic arches), a restored apartment showing what the apartments would've looked like originally, and the amazing roof with the twisted smoke-like water towers and chimneys, and the scowling Darth Vader like roof-guards.Did get quite busy throughout - I was grimacing at an (American) family who were not only touching all of the priceless museum pieces, but even rearranged the tables and chairs in the kitchenette so that they could stage a nice family photo or something *rolls eyes*. Also the teens that kept pressing the doorbell on the apartment door.Nice gift shop at the end with lots of Art Deco and Art Nouveau toys, gifts and books.Loved it!"

It's not a cheap evening and we were really looking forward to it. We had to eat early in order to make the time and then still had to queue (although it was quite a short queue for Barcelona). The mini tour we got was quite good although we didn't get to see very much as we would have had to pay extra again for the extra tour.It was a really hot, humid night and thought it would be a lovely experience to hear good music in such fabulous surroundings. The roof area however was stepped quite steeply in several distinct areas (and we were to sit in one of the stepped areas) and to get a place had to clamber through groups of people, not really able to see where you were going. At one point I stepped around one person thinking she was on one of the lesser steps to find myself stumbling down a steep step and banging my knee. Eventually found a space for us, although we couldn't see much of the trio because of the design of the roof. Thought once we'd got settled with a glass of cava that we could enjoy the evening but .... the jazz was awful. I'm not a jazz enthusiast but my husband is and he wasn't impressed at all. The Otto Preminger Trio was not worth the wait, the struggle to get seated and the heat! We soon felt we wanted to leave but felt a little embarrassed that we would have to battle through several groups, up and down steps and go past the trio to get out but, once we saw several others leaving, we took the plunge and weaved our way out.We were really fed up as we'd raced through dinner to what we thought would be a fabulous finale to our brilliant stay in Barcelona but was a real let down instead. Shame - it was the only place to let us down during what was a fabulous holiday."

Our package deal for 27 euros per person included a chance to see the inside of the building by way of a visit to the small Gaudi museum, a live jazz band on the roof-top and a glass of cava. There's so much of Gaudi's presence in the city if you look for it, and the museum proved to be very interesting about La Pedrera itself and Gaudi's other projects in Barce. The roof-top was fabulous at night, although I appreciate why they wouldn't allow anyone a second drink (not even to buy). There are quite a lot of big steps and although it's safe enough for sober adults, there aren't any barriers surrounding the rooftop. Rightly so, because they would probably ruin it."

The roof is quite spectacular with the various decorative chimneys. You go up there and can walk around them. They are functional and were not just decorative. I think we queued for over an hour to get in, if I remember rightly there was a reduction for those under 29 so my children got in for a reduced rate. I loved the house but I preferred the other Gaudi house, Casa Batilo which is on the same street, Avenue de Gracias as I felt it was more informative. But Casa Mila is well worth a visit."

The light and the spaces made this interesting for me as an artist and teacher. That also applied to the display in the attic where I would like to have spent longer. I recommend you pre book as that will save you an hour of standing in the hot sun."

The architect\u2019s inventiveness sweeps one away. (And thus my overall rating of 5) But does the building warrant its entrance fee of 16.50 euros? One can only answer in the negative. By all means search it out, marvel at its undulating fa\u00e7ade and take pictures. Then buy post cards of its roof. Unless you have a professional interest in architecture, the shameful price of admission is not worth what is gained by access to the roof. Rather, spend your euros on la Sagrada Familia or la Casa Batll\u00f3 or the Parc G\u00fcell.

I loved La Pedrera!At first we thought the price (16.50euros) might be a bit steep for only being able to see the roof, the attic and the first floor apartment, but actually it was all very interesting and we were there for quite a long time. The queue wasn't as bad as I thought it would be to get in. We arrived at about 10.30am and only had to wait about a minute to go in. We did buy an audioguide in English to help us round. We opted for the shorter 40minute one which was enough for us, but you could have opted for a 75minute tour. These cost 4euros each and were very interesting. The roof was by far my favourite part! It is spectacular! Not only do you get brilliant views across the city, the chimneys are amazing works of art with plenty of curves and arches and inviting twists and turns. Great photo opportunities!!After the roof, the exhibit in the attic tells you a bit more about Antoni Gaudi and his work. It covered information about Parc Guell, Casa Battlo and Sagrada Familia church so we didn't feel like we missed out too much when we didn't have the time to view these other Gaudi sites. The first floor apartment was laid out as it would have looked when it was first built. Some of the period furniture was beautiful.Finally you are herded out through the shop (where we bought some decently priced postcards). Overall I very much enjoyed this attraction. Heading up to the roof certainly has the wow factor and we spent most of our time up there admiring the views and Gaudi's architectural style. Not having visited any of the other Gaudi attractions in Barcelona I can't compare, but for me, La Pedrera is definitely worth a visit. I only wish we could have gone back for one of the night time visits...."

I chose the latter and found there was little to listen. I don't understand why they need to separate it as I pay full price.

It is less garish than Casa Batllo but his concepts of light, ventilation, curves and ergonomic designs are all present in La Pedrera as well. The rooftop is the one that is highly photographed and shown all over the world so do not miss this but do note that if it rains, the rooftop is closed to visitors.For us, La Pedrera is an awesome place but if you have to prioritise your Gaudi-buildings to visit, I would prefer Casa Batllo to La Pedrera. There seems to be more aspects of Gaudi to appreciate in Casa Batllo - more fun, craziness and freedom to design. La Pedrera is more refined and in some ways more muted.The attic area has some exhibits on Gaudi - but this section could have been done better. The lighting is very dim and the exhibits could have been given better exposure and be made more interesting. A real pity as it would have been an area of great interest after seeing so many buildings designed by him."

By buying our tickets online, we bypassed a line with an hours wait. I highly recommend getting the audio guide (additional 4 euros). There is a 45 min audio guide and 75 min audio guide for the same price. We purchased the 75 min audio guide when we checked in. All of the museum information is in Catalan, Spanish and a little English. We wouldn't have learned as much about the exhibit without the audio guide. This tour was great because it gave you information/pictures/videos about all of Gaudi's works, not just Casa Mila. You start the tour on the roof - then spend most of your time in the attic- and end inside the house. Would definitely recommend."

Next you proceed to a preserved apartment as it looked in the early 20th Century. The center courtyard is beautiful and provided outside light and ventilation long before air conditioning. Well worth a couples hours of your time in Barcelona."

While in Barcelona, we visited three Gaudi constructions (Sagrada Familia, Casa Batllo, and La Pedrera) and thought La Pedrera was by far the least interesting. To be fair, it was raining so the terrace was closed, though you could get glimpses of it out the windows, but also to be fair, they still charged full price for admission and it felt value was lacking. The displays in the attic would be interesting if you had not visited Sagrada Familia but having just come from there, we found them repetitive."

There was a small group of about 15 people and our tour guide brought us around giving us the history of the building and telling us all about the different rooms and views of the building! Although 30 euro may seem expensive there was a animated light show during the night time tour (which you don't get during the day) and the cava at the end was the perfect way to end the tour. It definitely gives another view of the Pedrera, seeing it illuminated at night made it more magical. Probably my favourite part of Barcelona"

The only way we could fit this into our short stay was to book onto the evening tour 'The Secret Pedrera', as it turns out this was a fantastic choice, places are limited so there was only 15 of us on the tour and the guide was fabulous, speaking fluent English. Instead of experiencing the building full of 500 other tourists we got to enjoy the architecture and space with just the 15 others on the tour. The content was fascintating and very informative finishing on the roof with spectacular views of the Sagrada Familia and a lovely glass of Cava.

This was our second time to Barcelona and I was unable to tour it last time so this time I decided it was a must see. I found this tour via Viator and when I noticed it was a night time tour I figured this was the way to go. Our tour guide was very good, she had excellent knowledge about the building's history and about Gaudi himself. La Pedrera is a spectacular building and the apartment we saw was just beautiful. There were no angles, just an ever shifting flow of wavy circular walls. I know if I lived there I would never want to move. The attic and the roof top were really the true treats. In the attic space you could see where Gaudi used inspiration from nature to create his buildings. The attic walls had the appearance of a spine and ribs of a whale. The rolling roof top and the centurion looking chimneys appeared to be standing guard of the building. We noticed that from one of the outlooks on the roof and arch seemed to be framing Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, Gaudi's current work in progress and probably masterpiece. It is too much of coincidence for it to be accidental and was probably by design to highlight his next work that was financed by this building. After the tour we were treated to a glass of Cava and chance to spend time in one the buildings courtyards. it was a great night and a highly enjoyable tour."

The roof is of course beautiful , but most of it can be seen from the street, and the fencing whilst important for safety, was tacky and impeded views.

The light, the angles, the attention to detail are all amazing and especially the apartment - I'd love to live in a space where you want to touch the wood, the mouldings and everything is pleasing to the eye. The roof terrace is lovely too, with the chimneys and undulating tiled roof - a little challenging to an older member of our party but still very much enjoyed.

Yes, the La Pedrera is quite something to see, but most of what is interesting can be seen from the outside. Going inside, you get to the inside of one of the apartments, which was pretty cool, but the way it was decorated wasn't anything special and sometimes detracted from the architecture around it. On the roof, they've added really quite ugly fences around the sides for safety- not part of Gaudi's design and again really mucking around with the overall sense and flow of the place. We didn't spend much time in the house at all- maybe an hour max. So, for the price I'd almost say it wasn't worth it...almost."

The tour is self-guided and takes you first from the ground floor by lift to the roof area where there are wonderful walkways. From there you move to the attic to see how the construction was created and see models of the house. The third area is the living quarters before moving back down to the gift shop and exit. An amazing place that cannot be imagined - it has to be experienced."

I wouldn't want to be there in high season though, I recommend March where it's not into high season yet but still nice weather. You also get to see an apartment as it might have looked in the day of Gaudi.

In the attic there is a nice display and explanation of Gaudi's work, so this house is also a good place to start your trip if you want to see more of his work (which you definitely will after seeing this).The only bad part is the fencing on the roof. The roof itself is so beautiful with all the sculptures on chimneys and staircases. But on the inside (around the patios) there originally was no fence. This was of course to dangerous for the tourists. But in stead of making something beautiful with wrought iron, in the spirit of Gaudi, they put up an ugly mesh wire.If you buy a guide on Gaudi's work first and read it before you visit, you will enjoy it even more!"

Really highlights the unique architecture. The tour guide was very informative and entertaining. The cava was cold and delightful at the end of the tour. If you don't go during the day, or if you are too busy in the day, certainly swing by at night and do this tour. A great view of the city at the top as well. One note, if you want to go to the gift shop, go before the tour. The tour starts at 9pm (English tour) and the gift shop closes at 8:30pm. There is also a restaurant at La Pedrera if you want to grab a drink or food before or after the tour. You might need reservations on certain nights."

I found the attic particularly interesting as I'm not use to attics being used for anything but storage so their description of its original use was cool. You can also see. The roof was definitely a unique thing to experience and while it might be difficult to truly appreciate if you have limited mobility it's fun to visit if you are able to climb around on it. Keep in mind it's very popular so if you have other things planned for the day that don't necessarily involve waiting in lines like just walking around the city or visiting Parc Guell (which is highly recommended if you like La Pedrera)."

You work your way into the attic where lies a very informative level of smaller models and interior structure of Gaudi's buildings. You will see where and how he gained his inspiration and how it developed into the incredible buildings they are today.Following on through will find yourself in an apartment set up as it once was back in the day, which gives you a great idea of how they lived.

Right now there's an exhibit comparing Gaud\u00ed with other contemporary architects like Frank Lloyd Wright in the US and MacIntosh in Scotland. The fact that there's a uniformed person standing at the entrance may be enough to disuade any but the most intrepid non-Spanish /non-Catalan speaker but just point to the poster outside or walk in the door as if you know where you're going. Once inside, you enter one of the open patios of the building where you can walk around on the ground level and walk up the stairs to the 1st floor where the gallery space is located. I imagine that for many people this may be enough of a taste of Gaud\u00ed and the price is right. Enjoy"

The museum inside basically repeats the information about Gaudi that the museums at every other Gaudi attraction already say though, and so was not really worth it. We'd have rather just gone to the Sagrada Familia (fantastic!) and the Casa Battlo down the road. Casa Battlo is much more ornate, colourful, etc. If La Pedrera was \u20ac5 each we wouldn't have had an issue, but we really felt a bit cheated having paid so much."

We were fortunate to arrive here and visit with no crowds so we were able to mooch along and enjoy the views both outside and inside that this attraction has to offer.I've said in previous reviews that the workings of the mind that was Gaudi to have thought to have designed places like this must have been a quirky place indeed. This is a must see visit on the list of things to go and see in Barcelona."

When it was shared that Gaudi's instructors had wondered if they'd unleashed a genius or madman, this amazing building perfectly illustrates that sentiment. A place that incorporated \"green\" building principles nearly 100 years ago, it's not surprising it was and remains a very unique design. Loved the accessibility to the roof to see all the design features, the attic for its intended community use, and the restored apartments reflecting the flexible design."

If you are not yet a big fan of Barcelona\u2019s historical superstar architect Antoni Gaudi, visit and see at least 3 \u2013 4 of his masterpieces and decide if he is for you. Everybody knows about Sagrada Familia (The Holy Family Church), but not everyone has seen a very special place- Casa Mila (The Stone Quarry) situated in a historical area on Passeig de Gracia 92 (near Metro Diagonal). If you have 2 or more hours o visit the place, go ahead, but many people are happy to see just an exterior, which is outstanding and very unusual. You look at the building and the first question is: what is dominating here \u2013 walls with its curvy forms or balconies adorned with unique ironwork? Everyone has got his own answer. But the reality is \u2013 all those balconies look like they have jumped here from the canvases of the most ingenious abstract painters. And to be exact those balconies have two authors: Gaudi and the iron-artist Joseph Maria Jujol. See my pictures and decide for yourself.  If you want to see the entire house, you need paid reservation or 14 euros plus 4 more euros for the audio-guide, and minimum 2 hours (with reservation) to see the attic, one apartment and will walk on the roof-top. Local guides call Casa Mila the quintessential modernist structure in civil architecture of Barcelona. For Antoni Gaudi Casa Mila was the last huge work ( from 1906 to 1911) before he dedicated his final years to the Sagrada Familia. I am not sure if there is anywhere in the world the apartment building with such brightly visible marriage of the stonework and the ironwork. Ask any photographer near Casa Mila and you will hear that he or she mostly did photograph metal works. Because of its fantastic forms! I was not an exception and now I am inviting you to see what I did pay attention to, when recently was in beautiful Barcelona and saw the Casa Mila.alftul"

We (my husband, college-age daughter and I) were in Barcelona in December 20012. The weather was warm but not always sunny. So when we entered and saw the sun was out, we immediately went to the Roof-Terrace. For me the terrace was the highlight. The architectural sculptures used for the chimneys, the stairwells and the ventilation towers really show Gaudi's talent. We stayed on the terrace over an hour and the views of Barcelona are nice on a clear day. The other areas are the attic which has a lot of info on Gaudi's architecture. You also can visit a recreated apartment of a family from the 1900s with original elements of that time. Lastly is the exhibition hall on the main floor which has an interesting staircase."

You go into the elegant interior ( don't miss the magnificent iron front gate) and you are taken up to the roof. I had seen the photos but I still wasn't prepared. Gaudi loved roofs and this one is spectacular - the chimneys are known as 'the witch-scarers': I thought of stormtroopers in Sat Wars (I am sure Gaudi didn't !!). They stand there isn the sun like soldiers with visors. Amazing. Then down through a fine collection of furniture to El Pis, the fully furnished Art Nouveau apartment, a wonderful opportunity to see how people really lived. You have got to go and it's on the ArticketBCN (30 euros) which takes you to six other museums for less than half the normal price of entry."

This is basically just an apartment building with some stores at ground level, but architect Antonio Gaudi re-conceived every aspect of this tired old genre and invented a whole new kind of building.--check out the inventive door knobs modeled in clay and then cast in bronze--look at the door frames made of plaster with a twist--notice the unusual free-form shape of interior windows.--look down at the patterned floors in dining rooms and bathrooms--look up at plaster medallions in the ceilings--look at the iron work in the handrails between stairsGaudi was always thinking over the old form to find a new take.The essence of his re-definition is best found in the details."

You can do the visit in 1 hour, but can linger around for probably another 1 hr or so. Although the rooftop is the main attraction, I really liked the main lobby area, looking up the open mid-section of the building. Keep in mind that you're not allowed in the roof if it is raining."

On the top floor, you can have a very good view of the city and take some good pictures of the city.

La Pedrera is already fascinating from the outside, wavy balconies with leaf shapes clinging to them, but do part with the rather exorbitant entrance fee of 16.50 euros to go in and experience this unique apartment for yourself. The rooftop is the most spectacular with the giant sentinels of chimney pots that seem to come from some science fiction movie and the pot-bellied stairwells inspired by conches from the sea. In fact, as the exhibits inside show, Gaudi was inspired by everything in nature, acorns, bark and branches of trees, surfaces and textures that form natural patterns. An elevator can take you up and down the many floors but you still need to climb up and down to see nooks and crannies, especially on the rooftop, so not very safe for children or the elderly, and some rooms and passageways are dimly-lit, but a fascinating journey through the wild imagination of an exceptional artiste.Stay in one of the hotels on the Passeig de Gracia to see both La Predera and Casa Battlo further down the road. Hotel Next To has a view of Casa Mila's chimney tops from its terrace. Don't miss the gift shop on the ground floor, full of well-crafted souvenirs, jewelry, stationery scarves, books, calendars."

You will save a lot than buying tickets individually.Nuf said, let's focus on the main topic - main people just stopped at the front corner of La Pedrera, looked up and took pictures. Don't just stopped there - go inside and pay a visit. It is definitely worth it - even for us which paid EUR16.5 per pax (see my comments re: Art-ticket above).Sagrada Familia is what Gaudi can do in a church. La Pedrera shows you what Gaudi can do in a residential block.You start off visiting the roof top - very smart idea. You can a glimpse of the neighbourhood and then proceed to the Attic level. The attic level provides good explanation of the technical aspect of Casa Milla and also the social backdrop when these all happened. Do take time to appreciate Casa Milla."

We arrived there at 10.00 and there was already a long line forming. Took us about one hour to get in. First of all it is important to say that you wont be able to see the whole building as there are people living there! You are allowed to go to the roof, which is quite nice and offers a nice view of Barcelona. After that you go one floor down, to the attic. The vault is interesting. You get to see some videos and expositions, but to be honest, after 5 min I was getting bored. After that you go another floor down and you get to see the flats... Some aspects are really nice, but overall, if you are not the person who will stare on things of other people, you will be bored. I liked the kitchen as it did not have typical angles of a room and the office, but that was about it. I got to try one of the chairs designed by Gaudi and surprisingly although they were from wood only, they were SUPER comfortable! Try it yourself, outside of the dining room, on the right side. And then you go down the stairs till you reach ground floor and that's it! It was really nice to see it for free, but I am not sure if I would recommend it to my friends"

It gets very crowded, people brushing up against one another to look at the merchandise. The useless security guard, who should be watching on the inside, was outside chatting with people and, when informed of the theft, kinda shrugged and suggested we go to the police, which we didn't as it is a useless waste of time. Fortunately, my husband felt it right away, but the thief slipped away in the crowd. I was able to call immediately and cancel the credit cards, small satisfaction that the use of them was thwarted. Anyway, just a reminder to be vigilant. Signs all over warn about pickpockets. Shame on the gift shop for not having more efficient security inside the store."

But there are two things I recommend: 1. Go on an overcast day, as that cuts down the lines considerably. It rained less than an hour before our visit, and we had no wait. The roof was open and fairly dry and we had plenty of time and room to move about on it. 2. Spend some time with the models in the attic. Some of the before/after ones are amazing and help you understand his architectural vision."

Casa Mila should not be missed just because you have seen the others and It is very close to the city centre."

I am not one to typically go to museums while traveling, and picking museums to see in Barcelona can be daunting, as there are so many and they are all quite pricey. With that said, after seeing photos of La Pedrera (Casa Mila), I decided to check it out, and was amazed as soon as I stepped onto the terrace. Gaudi's work is unique, to say the least, and this is one of his gems. The roof is spectacular to explore, and although not huge, it has just enough sculptures to keep you entertained. Not only do you leave feeling like you stepped into a sort of fantasy land/crazy house, but the views of Barcelona are also great from the roof top. Definitely worth the \u20ac16.50!"

The roof is fantastic, but closed if it is raining; so don't go unless you have no choice. It's easy to understand why: the flooring would be very slippery, if it was wet.The only downside: it was very busy. Queues to get in and people getting in the way of photography. Though, no doubt, we were getting in someone else's viewfinder."

The outside of the block of flats is astonishing, with hardly a straight line anywhere. The attraction is accessible in three parts: the roof (great views, flowing rooflines and astonishing chimneys), the attic (a tour de force, unbelievably, and containing an exhibition explaining Gaudi's ideas and principles) and a flat, funished in the style of the period. From the plan in the exhibition, the layout of the flat was bizarre - but on entering, it can be seen to work brilliantly. The piece de resistance.There is a cafe and shop on the ground floor. Also worth looking at are the interior 'courtyards'- if the ovaloid shapes can be termed as such.As Glasgow has Mackintosh, so Barcelona has Gaudi.Only a minor quibble: at E16.50 it was a bit pricy - dearer than the Sagrada Familia."

Take the metro to Diagonal and it is just a few steps away. The undulating facades are like a beach after the tide has gone out; the wrought iron balconies resemble clumps of seaweed. This is one of the world's most original buildings.The entrance fee is not cheap - 16 euros, but if you like what you see on the outside, do venture inside - it is well worth a visit. The atrium is like a sumptuous cave, with columns in organic forms and fantastic wall paintings. Take the lift to the roof, which is like a fabulous chimney-top playground with wonderful views over the city. Make sure you get a photo of La Sagrada Familia from up here - this is probably the best place from which to view Gaudi's cathedral.The 'attic' has an interesting exhibition about the construction of the building, with lots of maquettes, but the next floor down is the real highlight - a reconstruction of the decor and furnishings from the building's heyday, when it was built for the Mila family. Wow - this is just incredible. If you love art nouveau style, then do not miss this.If you are planning to see both the Casa Battlo and La Pedrera, I would recommend that you see Casa Battlo first. Although its dragon-backed roof and scaly walls may be more spectacular, I think that the interior of La Pedrera is the more impressive. It only takes five minutes to walk between the two, so make sure you see them both."

Next level down features film, slide shows, and architectural models highlighting his life, his methodology, his wide range of design skill, from building, to furniture making, to mosaic, to wrought iron, to the unimaginable. Since the building was erected as an apartment building, the next level was a tour of an entire furnished unit. Each flat appears to have taken up an entire level, as a serpentine series of rooms around a central inner atrium running down the entire core of the building.

The windows and the balconies are done with sheer artistic freedom, the chimneys are scattered spontaneously in every position making the building look like a fairy tale palace. Gaud\u00ed called this house \"la pedrera\" but it's so much more than a quarry, like the translation could suggest. It looks as if it was done by everything soft and magic; think this was done around 100 years ago! Gaud\u00ed here also introduces the so-called chained arch, like a round soft V upside down: this stunning shape is perfect anywhere, it looks from time to time the inside of a whale, or a pure and white gothic monastery. Visiting this house before the Casa Batll\u00f3 will help you set the correct time frame: believe me, you'll do good if you do like this!

On the same street, not very far away is also Casa Batlo, another really important work of art of Gaudi. This one is more particular on the inside. I really loved them both!

Being a great admirer of Antoni Gaudi I placed La Pedrera near the top of my itinerary on a 5 day visit to Barcelona assuring my wife that this was a building not to be missed...but what a disappointment.Alarm bells started to ring at the very start as we followed the direction signs and began a long ascent up the stairs. We almost turned half way up thinking we had taken a wrong turn.Rising up from the ground floor to the 6th floor (not for the elderly or the faint hearted) we emerged onto the `Espai Gaudi`, using it's architectual structure to house an informative exhibition on Gaudi's construction methods and design features with scale models, videos, photographs and text etc. An impressive and professional effort but uninspiring.Another short climb brought us onto the roof terrace, clearly the highlight of the visit with it's weird and wonderful chimneys and ventilation towers but the what can only be described as `brutal` railings detract from the whole effect. Surely someone could have come up with a better solution than this, more worthy of the great man.Next on the tour was the Pedrera apartment (two floors down) which is a recreation, displaying original period furniture, fixtures etc; good, but in my opinion failing to reach the standards of his other Barcelona buildings.The `main` floor, which is actually the first floor was closed for renovation so I cannot comment except to say that this was not pointed out at the ticket desk... Perhaps they forgot as they also forgot to tell us that there is a lift to the roof located across the courtyard!We visited in early September 2012. The cost was a pricey 16.50 Euros each with an extra charge for an optional audio guide.The staff were polite and friendly but I only seen them on the ground floor. The roof should be visited first and you make your way down; first to the attic `Espai` exhibition and then the apartment but if you climb the stairs, as we had to do, you can view the exhibition first (have a rest) and then go up to the roof. Best to avoid the stairs and ask where the lift is.However, unless you are a real Gaudi fan I would avoid La Pedrera, save your money and walk down the street to the magnificent Casa Batllo."

I went to La Pedrera after Casa Batllo, which I found to be a good order to visit them in as the audio guide at Batllo provided more general information about Gaudi and his work, whilst the guide at Pedrera seemed to be specifically about the building. The crazy roof is a must-see attraction, but after visiting Batllo it feels like you only get to see a very small part of the building (roof, a reconstructed apartment, and the atrium). The \"Gaudi space\" in the attic was very good, however, and between that and the Gaudi and Nature exhibit at La Sagrada Familia, I left Barcelona with a much better understanding of his work."

La Pedrera is such a classis work by Gaudi. The models and drawings in the attic are worth the trip alone as they explain the architectural style and engineering. The chimney flues on the roof are classic (look for the one with the broken champagne bottles in it) and the furnished apartment gives a very real impression of what it was like to live in Casa Mila. Get the audio tour."

It's not that it's any less spectacular in its' own way.There's a good exhibition inside the building and the audio guide is ok. You can take as long as you like to linger and take photo's. It's interesting to see how the inside space is lived in. A shame that one of the main rooms is taken up with a gift shop but they couldn't have put it anywhere else. The roof space has great views of the city and is remarkable if a little spoiled by the metal railings that aren't in keeping with Gaudi style and so spoiled it for me-but that's a personal perspective. If you're short on time admire this from the ouside but go into both or either of the other two."

The roof top is not to be missed with an amazing view out to La Sagrada Familia but especially its wondefully playful ventilation towers, chimneys and stairwells. The attic too is a treat for the eyes. The space was originally used as storage and for clothes drying. 270 arches support the roof-terrace.

The top floor has the famous human-figure chimneys. If visiting during summer, visit in the morning or afternoon so you can use the shade to rest. The attic is a mini audio-visual museum, and it's very informative.

I saw Sagrada Familia (incredible, obviously), Park Guell, and then decided to check out La Pedrera. I left feeling somewhat disappointed, and wish instead I had checked out Casa Batllo as it looked better.The only real draw, IMO, to La Padrera was the chimneys. They were neat, and walking around the roof was very interesting. You can see where Gaudi used smashed wine bottles to decorate one of the chimneys, and you can get an up-close look at the tiling and designs (I think the orange chimneys kind of look like Storm Troopers). Then you go downstairs one floor, to Gaudi's old workspace (which does have some similar design features as Sagrada Familia) and there are some exhibits, models, etc. on display. It is interesting, I suppose, but not so much so that it kept my attention or made me feel like the admission fee was worth it. At the end of this level, though, the part about design of furniture and door handles is interesting and worth watching (there's a short video). Exiting this level, you go down one more level to see an apartment, which is interesting but is nothing spectacular and didn't seem to highlight Gaudi's work in the way I would have liked. All I really took away from that apartment was (1) it's pretty big and (2) the door handles really are made to fit your hand.Overall I just kind of felt like the price they charged wasn't worth it and if I was to return to Barcelona, this would not be something I'd go see. It just isn't nearly as interesting as the Sagrada Familia (comparable admission fee) or Park Guell (free), so I'd spend your money on Gaudi sites elsewhere."

It was 20 Euros to go to this including the Audio Guide (Which I find to be helpful on most attractions)The outside of the building is cool and is probably the most famous intersection shot in Barcelona. The front of the building is cool and the Roof is cool. I liked the smoke stacks and stairs enterances. They are famous looking and easily recognizable to most people.Other than the roof, you visit the Attic and an apartment. The attic is an exhibit on Gaudi and shows his many works, Its brick dome look is interesting. The Apartment was useless and a waste of time, It was decorated in the decor of the early 1900's.The Facade and the Roof are really the only interesting things worth seeing and IMO not worth the 20 Euros.Its not worth more than 7-10 Euros"

Even the sidewalk pavers are designed and carved! Summer evenings also offer jazz and champagne on the roof and night tours.

I've been wanting to see other buildings by Gaudi other than the Sagrada Familiar and Parc Guell, but the admission for this Casa Mila was EUR16 and I thought that was quite expensive (perhaps that's the average price to pay for admission these days). On the inside, the most spectacular views were on the rooftop where Gaudi designed functional chimneys, stairwells and vents into interesting structures. Then there were 2 other levels for visitors: The attic and the apartment. At the attic you get to see models of other Gaudi architecture and the apartment gives you a feel of how a residential area inside Casa Mila is like. Once we were inside we found out that you could also visit Casa Mila at night for a panaromic night view of central Barcelona from the rooftop, which seems like a better idea than to visit during the day. So do check whether it's open at night during the time of your visit and choose according to your preference."

You only get to visit the roof, the attic (which has a lot of info on the inspiration for the work) and a typical apartment. I don't know what else I expected, but other than the roof it didn't really deliver."

The famous exterior and rooftop are characteristic of Gaudi's work, but the tour of the apartment was unremarkable, i.e. a typical early 1900 design that I've seen in San Francisco. I enjoyed the Casa Batllo tour more.The entrance fee must be paid in cash, no credit cards. The audio handset is a must. The tour starts on the roof, so you can either take one of the two elevators or walk about seven floors."

It was interesting, definitely, but we did feel the price was a bit of a rip-off. Was a good example of his architecture -- and once we saw it, we had no further interest in seeing any other Gaudi buildings. So, I would say when visiting Barcelona make sure you see one of Gaudi's creations, then decide if you want to see any more. Perhaps we chose the wrong one to visit."

I would recommend you did it the other way round as we were so overwhelmed by the Cathedral, seeing this place was a little bit of an anti-climax. But impressive architecture.The rooftop is the main attraction and being so afraid of heights with vertigo, I couldn't wander far from the entrance and exit of this area. The walkways are safe. It was just my problem I couldn't do it. My wife went round for me and took my pictures for me. Fantastic views and fabulous features. However I still had a appreciated the chimneys from where I stood.We didn't have time to see Casa Batll\u00f3 but one reviewer said Casa Mila was poor value for money. I agree it is pricey and after reading that I wish we had seen Casa Batll\u00f3. However if you're prepared to pay \u20ac16 per person and queue 15-20min to get in then it is worth seeing, just probably not the best one of all the Gaudi places to visit."

We all know that Gaudis architecture can leave you awe struck - but I recently had the opportunity to do the night visit at La Pedrera . . . and wow!The night tour offers an insight into how the house would have been when in use back in the turn of the century and it has been elegantly designed and is beautifully presented. What I loved about this house is that it is still being used today - yes that means that we could only visit the ground floor, one upper floor and the roof top, but it was definitely worth every penny.The house is both a museum and a living, breathing treasure - such a rarity.The other plus is that the night visit had considerably less people allowing for a very intimate and personal experience . . . No line to get in as it is booked with a specific start time based on language - and it was all followed up with a glass of cava in the company of your fellow travellers. I would have loved to have been there over a weekend when they host live jazz on the terrace during the Summer . . . but no complaints about the thoughtful and elegant evening that I enjoyed with my Mum, my cousin and about twenty other curious companions.I love Gaudi - I would give any building of his an excellent just for existing - but this is truly one of the most surprisingly interesting visits I have done in a long time and it really helped to make the house come alive."

The exhibits are well done but the magic is seeing how Gaudi was able to make utilitarian roof top vents into works of art. The atrium design also allows light and fresh to permeate each apartment. The absence of load bearing inner walls was visionary for 100 years ago. The building still seems contemporary in spite of it's age. The lines can be quite long, we would estimate an hour wait BUT with the 7 museum art pass we were able to bypass the lineup and get immediate access! This alone was worth the price of having the pass, not to mention the savings. We purchased our pass at the Picasso Museum but it is available at all the venues.TIP: Buy the Barcelona 7 museum Art Pass. You break even if you visit just 2 of the venues but most important you get to skip the lineup for tickets at all the venues"

I liked this very much, it was the first Gaudi house we went to, but because a lot of the building is in private use (it's a big building) you only get to see a very small portion and for me there was not quite as much detail and it's not as ornate as some of the others, that said, it's still stunning. It's worth going up for the Chimneys and crazy roof, but the door and beautiful Balconys are viewable from outside, so if you are limited by funds or time and only get to one Gaudi, do Casa Battlo, just across the road, which is stunning."

It shows once again what is possible when an architectural genius is given a free hand ( and lots of money!) to do his creative best. The building is replete with magical \"tricks\", such as the false perspective when looking up in the courtyard, the extra-terrestial creatures on the roof and Gaudi's dogged refusal to have anything to to do with straight lines. It is said that when the privileged owner of one of the apartments complained to Sr Gaudi that there was no straight wall against which to set her piano, he replied \"Then buy yourself a flute!\"My advice is buy yourself a ticket."

We have also been to Sagrada Familia, but this site has more basic information about Gaudi's influences and philosophy. Even having been before, we did not regret another visit. If you have only money or time for one site, I guess I would have to say Sagrada Familia because the scope is so monumental and awe-inspiring (and I hate the word awesome and try never to use it, so take this for what it's worth!).

From the time you arrive at the imposing front gates to the time you leave it is another world, Gaudi's last public building and \"Modernista\" circa 1912. The downstairs foyer has been re-modeled but is still a delight with a large open light well and high decorated walls and ceilings. The apartment open to visitors is like a film set, decked out in original furniture, artifacts, clothes, machinery and much more from a posh early 20th century family life (with servants). It's amazing to see the rooms themselves, their view and so on but for me the interest was the way they lived. It's a HUGE apartment. Then up to the museum under the roof. Gaudi, like all Moderernista architects was drawing inspiration from 3 things. Nature, the Catalan Empire (14th Century) and the use of \"cheap\" building materials. Of course, with wealthy clients he would stretch the point on the \"cheap materials\"and use beautiful and expensive materials with a tem of talented artisans who were drawn to his vision, but the ideal is reflected in the use of mosaics, glass bottle bottoms moulded together and so on. The museum explores his inspirations, from the simple corn cob and snake skeleton to the very sophisticated \"upside down hanging arches made from fine chains\" (I can't really describe this) that gave him some building forms. There's a lot of interactive exhibits for kids to enjoy, and it's simply wonderful to be in these vast, under-roof, symmetrical but uneven vaulted spaces with columns.The roof, ah the roof. It's uneven, it's spectacular, it has great views, but most of all it has the famous chimneys that supposedly inspired George Lucas for the stormtroopers in the Star Wars films. Lots of other elements too, like the water towers and wobbly walls and railings. Caixa Catalunya, which has it's cultural centre offices in the building, runs a summer program of jazz, music and performances on the roof. Watch their site for information (and sometimes arrive to a complimentary glass of Cava). My photo is from one of these events, a very funny and clever solo mime/musician/performer.The Gallery, which is FREE, and is separate to the above has touring and locally put together exhibitions. We have seen some excellent exhibitions here. These exhibitions, always with well-written notes, at times features artists and movements not so well remembered. At other times it will be a show of for example the famous Russian Constructivists, a Vladamir Melevitch exhibition and so on.Are we allowed to put websites on Trip Advisor? http://www.lapedrera.com/en/what-la-pedrera has all the info you will need for a visit to the building, the events on around the time of your visit and the exhibitions.Please note, I am not 100% sure that there is wheelchair access to ALL levels. There are certainly lifts... but do check. La Pedrera has a programme called \u201cAccessible La Pedrera\u201d, which has sensory resources in exhibitions and concerts. These resources are for the hard of hearing (sign language) and audio descriptions for the partially sighted."

Designed by Gaudi It was a controversial design at the time for the undulating stone facade and with wrought iron decoration of the balconies and windows, designed largely by Josep Maria Jujol, who also created some of the plaster ceilings. Architecturally it is considered an innovative work for its steel structure and free form partitioning inside. The fa\u00e7ade is self-supporting. Other innovative elements were the construction of underground car parking and separate lifts and stairs for the owners and their servants.The roof is on different levels with oddly designed chimneys, vents and decoration.Included in the tour is a visit around rooms that are strctured and furnished similarly to the original intentions. A visit not to be missed"

You may consider audio guide if you wish to get into knowing all the details of this building. You have two options for the audio guide, one which has general information and is of around 30-45 mins, for a general tourist this one should be fine but if you want the information in depth the other audio guide of 1hr or perhaps more is available too."

I really thought this was a great piece of architecture and quite enjoyed walking around and looking at it.The roof (where your self guided tour starts) is probably the best part. The way that even the simple things have been designed to look so good and at the same time be very practical is really nice and worth going to see on its own. The rest of the house varies as parts show what it would have been furnished with but without and specificity great designs in it (compared to the roof anyway) but the attention to detail he had to make things very practical and is probably why it doesn't look amazingly fancy, if it did it would just be a pain to live in.Part of the house, nearer the end has some models and explanations of how Gaud\u00ed designed his works and the alternative methods he used to work out how to construct these buildings which was quite interesting and informative.I think the the main houses Gaud\u00ed designed that you can see in this area is this and Casa Batll\u00f3, out of the two this is the better one (not to say Casa Batll\u00f3 isn't good though).The length of time to tour around the house varies but if you get the audio guide (costs extra) there are two or three different ones which last different lengths of time, each costing a different amount. I think they've done this as the full tour (which I went for) is around an hour and a half which might be to long for some people so there are shorter versions which I guess cut parts out."

Less use of colour than in the other Gaudi residential buildings we visited, but wonderfully creative use of space and light. As well as being able to visit an apartment, entry includes access to the attic and the roof terrace - both really interesting. We opted not to take an audioguide but just to take in the aesthetics."

As has been mentioned, Casa Batllo (which is located on the same street) is far superior. Not only that, but Palau Guell is another similar construct which beats it hands down.The problem La Pedrera has is consistency - whilst it's rivals are flawless, there are parts of La Pedrera which are bang average. Stairwells that could be in any office block in the world etc.The attic includes a small museum, but the vast majority of it's content is about othe Gaudi works; the two aforementioned plus La Sagrada Familia etc. To me, this suggests there isn't enough of interest for La Pedrera to stand alone (it is also a little boring of you've already visited them and had better explanations).It isn't bad, and I wouldn't say \"don't go\". But certainly prioritise the others and callibrate your expectation accordingly!"

It's the only Gaudi attractions that I paid to get in (still thought it's rather pricey for the experience). The rooftop is the highlight, and is quite an eye opener - that someone was open-minded enough to commission this bizarre design. Looks pleasing in the eye but not so practical I think. There were a few complex looking steps that look quite easy to trip on if you don't pay enough attention, especially when you're busy taking photographs and it rained (plus a pool of water actually forming in few corners). From a few angles, the low walls intersecting the mid part of the rooftop create an impression of sea waves. Didn't get much impression of city view from there, think it wasn't high enough to get a good view but could definitely see the top levels of the ugly apartments around it.Then there was one building level that has a long, circular design that was supposed to be inspired from snake skeleton. Was dark with strategic yellow lightings that gave an impression of being in a cave (or inside a giant snake). The show apartment unit was interesting in that it still had the items from that era i.e. furniture and small stuff like food tins. Could really picture how a wealthy family lived then.The queue for this place is much longer than Casa Battlo (at least when I passed both midday in the same day). Might take at least an hour and a half before you can get in. So the best thing is either come very early, like a bit before the opening time e.g. 8.45, or book online. The latter is either new or very underutilized judging from the long ticket queue and lack of coordination from the staff side on my online order. There wasn't a special queue for online order - just go to one of the staff and asked to cut the queue. Took them almost 10 mins to find my ticket in the system. In any case, going early is always the best. Be among the first to arrive on the rooftop if you can. Otherwise you can't avoid having other people in your rooftop pictures."

We went at about 9:30 am and the line up wasn't bad but be prepared for crowds. If only doing 2 Gaudi creations I would choose Casa Battlo and the Sangrada Familia but this one would come in third.

The tour starts on the roof, with the typical Gaudi features, which were interesting but nothing more and possibly something less than at Battlo, or at Guell, and far far less than at Sagrada Familia. Next, one walks through an attic space that was, in essence, nothing. It is in sharp contrast to Battlo or Guell, each of which had hundreds of perfectly executed unique new ideas in the actualization of the design. The next step is through the apartment, where one looks at the old furniture in the rooms. interesting enough, but not designed by Gaudi. The moldings were about the only features of Gaudi note. Finally, as one reaches the bottom floor, staff tells you there is nothing here. That isn't quite true, as there is an interesting foyer on the way out. All in all, this was much much less of an event to us than the other 3 Gaudi destinations listed above. We did not think this was remotely in their same ballpark. If you don't have time for all of them, make this the one you skip."

The inside has sort of a museum set-up which leads to a lengthy staircase (6 stories?) to get up to the roof. The roof is unique and bordering on weird but doesn't offer enough to justify the entry fee.

Antoni Gaudi was way ahead of his time. The design of Casa Mila is like a huge rock carved in waves with no straight lines. Incredible work of the genius Gaudi. The exterior is covered in stones in their natural color. This is why the Catalans called it La Pedrera or 'the quarry'. The windows, balconies & staircases are made with exquisite wrought iron work. The visionary Gaudi combined art nouveau and expressionist style. Casa Mila is a 'must see' in Barcelona."

Maybe not our modern taste but utterly fascinating to see. Of course the roof and the chimneys are incredible and not to be missed - especially fun is the view to Sagrada Familia in the distance - but for me the REAL don't miss is the attic where there are wonderful displays that explain how Gaudi created the sensuous angles and motifs that fill his work. Long before the computer and with just his mind and his hands he created these amazing masterworks of architecture. Incredible to think he died by being run over by a tram, then lay unidentified for days before dying, unknown and unclaimed. He sought to give glory to his God with his work and so he did, to our delight and wonder."

Because our day was planned around certain things we couldn\u2019t go to Casa Mila first thing in the morning (which is what I would suggest doing b/c of the ticket line. I believe it opens at 9:00 a.m.) You can\u2019t pre-purchase tickets online, which I\u2019m a little surprised by, because both Sagrada Familia & Casa Batllo have that option and saved us tons of time. If they had this option I would change my review from a 4 to a 5.We got there around 11:00-11:30, and waited about 40 minutes to buy tickets \u2013 which really wasn\u2019t that bad. We didn\u2019t get the audio tour here.If you only have time for Casa Batllo or Casa Mila I\u2019d choose Casa Mila. Rating all Guadi\u2019s stuff in order of \u201cmust see\u201d I\u2019d say Sagrada Familia (we did the audio tour here), Guell Park, Casa Mila and Casa Batllo (also did the audio tour here (it\u2019s part of the ticket if you want to go inside)) last.Getting there \u2013 Take the Metro to the Diagonal stop, both Casa Batllo & Casa Mila are on the same street"

You get to see a lot, and it's all beautiful and amazing.The queue begins early and can get quite long. However, La Pedrera is included in the 30 Euro Barcelona Articket (which also covers the Miro and Picasso museums as well as the National Art Museum of Catalonia (MNAC) -- which is itself a gem) and if you have an Articket you can enter by a separate entrance (just east of the main public entrance on Provenca) and skip the queue.We picked up a book on La Pedrera from a local bookstore before we visited and that helped a lot -- we had a basic understanding of the significance of much of what we were seeing and knew some things to look for.

An interesting museum that shows how Gaudi worked, what his influences were and how much he cared about creating environments that make humans feel comfortable. There's also art gallery spaces that were closed when we visited and excellent audio guides that you shouldn't miss.

For me, what sets Casa Mila apart is the attention to detail everywhere in its design - from the metalwork outside the windows to the interiors of the appartment and the vaulting in the attic ceiling. And that is before you get to the roof!!! Then you will see what people rave about - its just, well, totally different to anything you will have seen. Kind of like a fairy castle for adults!The entry fee is expensive, however.... see if you can go early or buy online. The Casa Batllo, Casa Mila/Pedrera and the Sagrada Familia will set you back over Euros 45 in total to see - NOT cheap! I would also start with Sagrada Familia, because I think the museum and exhibits there offer the best explanation of Gaudi's influences and upbringing, setting the scene for visits to the houses."

Also recommend taking the audio guide - it completes the visit and enriches the overall experience immensely. Inside you get to see: the roof with amazing unique sculpture-like chimneys and views of Barcelona, the attic with exposition about Gaudi's style and what influenced him, and an apartment which takes up a full floor and is furnished with furniture of the time when Casa was built. Experiencing the roof feels like exploring a new world - the chimneys are unique, the roof itself has different levels (with steps), and you can spend some time wandering around, enjoying the structure, overlooking Barcelona and peeking into the inner yards, appreciating how light penetrates the whole structure and how it all comes together in a single building. There are safety barriers, but you do have to watch your step. If you visit Sagrada Familia later - you will notice that some of the sculptures on the Passion Facade repeat the futuristic style of some of the chimneys. The apartment takes up the full floor and we enjoyed seeing how a well-to do family furnished their place and lived early in the 20th century - including the kitchen, bathrooms, living spaces, etc. A worthy visit. Cannot compare with Casa Batllo as we didn't visit it. Visiting Casa Mila together with Park Guell and la Sagrada Familia gave us a great understanding of Gaudi's work."

Last time I was in Barcelona I visited the roof of this fascinating building but did not have time to see the interior so this time I visited both. I love the outside of the building so I was a little disappointed to find the flat so ordinary. After seeing the inside of the Casa Batllo I had expected a similar style here in the Casa Mila. The way the flat was furnished would not have been out of place in any other building of the period. I found it strange that the people that lived here would have wanted such traditional interior when they lived in a build with wonderfully different fa\u00e7ade and court yard. The roof is fantastic, but a little scary if you are as afraid of heights as I am. The views are stunning if like me you love photography you will spend hours taking pictures of the chimneys as the light changes. This is a fascinating place to visit and the exhibiton in the attic below the roof is well worth a visit. The exhibition includes a very interesting film documenting the building of the Casa Mila, which is defiantly worth a few minutes of your time. Unless you want to spend a lot of money, avoid the two gift shops. The same souvenirs are on sale all over Barcelona much cheaper."

La Pedrera is a residential apartment building built in 1912 with a distinctive modernist sculpted fa\u00e7ade which is among the must-see works of famed Catalan architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed. It is one of the architectural icons of Barcelona, prominently located on a corner of Carrer de Proven\u00e7a with the fashionable shopping street, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia.La Pedrera is well-located as a stage in a walking tour of Gaud\u00ed works in the centre of Barcelona, just 1.7km southwest of La Sagrada Familia. A pleasant and practical 4km \"Gaud\u00ed walk\" route is from La Sagrada Familia via Carrer de Proven\u00e7a to the Pedrera, then southeast down stylish, boutique-filled Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia past Gaud\u00ed's Casa Batll\u00f3, through Plaza Catalu\u00f1a and La Rambla, to Gaud\u00ed's extraordinary Palau G\u00fcell in the side-street Carrer Nou de la Rambla.Many interesting displays and exhibits were inside and accessible for the \u20ac7.50 per person entry ticket when we visited in February 2012.

So, we cued up and bought our 12Euro ticket (which we could have gotten for cheaper had we bought our bus tour tickets first!) and explored inside the UNESCO World Heritage Site. The roof was SO cool. From here, we got our first glimpse of the sea, La Sagrada Familia, Torre Agbar and the general beauty of Barcelona.

The roof with the chimneys is superb, so is the attic in which the curves of the walls and games of light fill in the space. The rest of the house has some rooms furnished with objects of the era, while other areas are still inhabited, hold shops (there's a gift shop at ground level) or hold art exhibits and events. Some of the exhibits and events are free, wo it's worth checking. The facade appears to be melting and is qite unique; the stone is white but up until 10-15 years ago appeared black because of pollution. It looked even more impressing as it contrasted with the buildings around it that are also quite light in color. Still an amazing sight."

You get to see an apartment the way it was furnished during the period is was occupied; the attic area houses a museum on the building and his work, and you get to go to the rooftop. If you get a thing called the ArtCard or ArtPass (can't remember which--at the Tourist Offices) it affords a significantly discounted price to get into 5 major museums, this being one them. So that cuts down on the expensive entry fee. Take the audio tour. The apartment is really facinating and the period furniture is wonderful. Looking out the windows, especially in the central atrium--gives you a great understanding of Gaudi's genius and made me, at least, more in awe that ever of his determination to purse his vision. The rooftop is truly amazing, because there is not a straight lined-surface anywhere. It looks like a total fantasy building with all the chimmenies and yet it was highly functioning. Plus the views from the roof of Barcelona are wonderful. Go before sunset, as it gets very crowded for the sunset and you could wait a long time on line. The attic, where the museum part is, is worth spending at least an hour, checking out the short films, the scale models of the building and the influences on his work. My only complaint is the elevator only holds 5-6 people so you end up waiting a long time just to up to the apartment, even though you've waited to get into the building. They need a better system for getting more people into the building faster. However, all in all, well worth the time and the money."

The terrace is impressive with the soldier-like chimneys and the dizzying views. The attic is impressive with lots of informations and photos on the history of La Pedrera and Gaudi himself. Following this the equally impressive period decoration of the appartment below is very useful to give you a clear idea of how rich people lived at that time.

La Pedrera, one of Anton Gaudi's apartment buildings is privately owned, so only the terrace on the top of the building and one display apartment is open to the public. A lift is available to the apartment if you don't wish to walk up the eight floors. Standing in the area near the staircase you look up into an atrium where the entrances to other apartments can be seen. It's like being in another world....amazing atmosphere...so peaceful...so different.The apartment was designed by Gaudi with modern concepts e.g. the main bedroom had a private bathroom attached (ensuite); there was plan living with a combined living room and dining room; lots of large windows with loads of light flooding the rooms. Almost every room had large windows, except the maid's bedroom, which was quite big by early 20th century standards. I couldn't believe there were copper hot water cisterns in both bathrooms and a shower attachment in the ensuite. The kitchen was amazing with a Butler's pantry with sliding door to the main kitchen which had lots of storage, overhead cupboards and marble sinks. The stove (an Aga)was in own little side nook with two large windows to open for ventilation....huge even by today's standards. Balconies were dotted at different spots around the exterior with iron railings of a modern sculptured look.There was the inevitable shop attached to the building, but unlike most others like it, this one was amazing...quite possibly the best range and quality I've seen in Barcelona. I bought several souvenirs, among them an amazing piece of silver jewellery.Do not miss seeing this building....it is worth the wait and the entrance fee. You will not be disappointed. Just don't rush your way through....the apartment and roof terrace need time to absorb and take in your surroundings."

The building's design was also pretty special. For the work of Gaudi, I wanted to give it a 4 star rating, however, given the overall experience, I would give a 3 instead.Visit wise, it's a little like a regular historic house visit (touring the various room) to some one's home and finally visit the special chimneys that it has on top. Staff were not exactly too friendly, and they were trying to control the crowd visiting the place.Personally, I find that the fencing/barricades they used were very distracting and the choice of color was grey, and it did not go well with the warm colors of the chimneys. There were also quite a number of tourists walking about and taking photos, so it is very difficult to get a decent photo shot without people inside. It was a little disappointing for me as I would like to shoot photographs of the place without the ugly grey fencing and the crowd. Then again, what do I expect from a touristy place like the Casa Mila?"

La Pedrera (the Stone Quarry) or Casa Mila, completed in 1910, was Antoni Gaudi\u2019s last work before he dedicated the rest of his life to La Sagrada Familia. Fantastic is actually an understatement when describing this mosaic tile covered building. There is nothing conventional about it and about the only straight lines are the floors, everything else is curved one way or another. Gaudi was a genius and paid attention to every detail of his buildings. Nothing was too small or insignificant to be overlooked \u2013 down to the door knobs and coat hooks. In this building, there are no interior load-bearing walls, so the interior walls could be moved at will \u2013 and did not have to be straight. The building is six stories high, plus an attic. He also designed interior courtyards to maximize light and ventilation. Our first stop was the roof. This was no ordinary roof \u2013 it was a \u201csculpture park,\u201d the chimneys resembled medieval warriors and the huge ventilator ducts were twisted into bizarre organic forms. To say it was surreal is an understatement. To top it off, it also gave us a great view of Barcelona. The roof itself was worth the price of admission, but, wait, there was more. Our next stop was the attic and, you guessed it \u2013 not an ordinary attic. This was where the washing was to be done \u2013 in a vaulted attic with 270 brick arches which form skeletal corridors. It now houses a museum describing Gaudi\u2019s work and how this building was designed. On display in this area were samples of the furniture and hardware Gaudi had designed for this building. It was amazingly functional and quite attractive. Our last stop was an apartment furnished as it would have been in late 19th-century Barcelona \u2013 Gaudi-style. It was really stunning. We had a great time going through it."

Gaudi is one of the most famous spanish architects and he has designed also f.ex. the church Sagrada Familia and Park Guell, both in Barcelona. Casa Mila completed in 1912, and It's located at Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia 92. Passeig de Gracia is major shopping street in Barcelona, along with Diagonal and la Rambla. Casa Mila is very easy to reach, and it's absolutely one of the places You have to see if You visit in Barcelona.Admission charge is 15 euros, and usually they don't take too much people in at the same time, so You have enough room and time to see this wonderful building throughout. At first, You have to take the stairs to the roof, stairs are very narrow and sharp, but as soon as you enter the roof, You'll be amazed... Ventilation towers and chimneys are just like from Star Wars (yeah, look at the pictures...) and the panoramic view over the whole city is unforgettable. You can also enter the attic, atrium and even to one restored apartment."

I also enjoyed seeing the apartment that was completely furnished with period furniture of that time when the building was new. You can see how people who had money lived in apartments at that time. There are decorative objects, paintings and household utensils.And the rooftop terrace is wonderful because you can see the chimney stacks in such fanciful shapes, everything being very original. They really look like modern art sculptures. Gaudi was really a genius in inventing these shapes, and using trencadis to decorate them."

The attic space allows you to see the underneath of the amazing roof and how it was created and the displays help you to understand Gaudi's inspiration of form from nature. If like me you don't have a head for heights than you may not want to walk around the walkways that twist and turn around the amazing chimney pot areas - put you can just go up look around and come straight down!The rooms of the flat are very comprehensively furnished and are built around a central atrium stairwell providing lots of light.

I didn't think much or even know much about Gaudi before my trip to Barcelona and my girlfriend was much more interested in seeing this site than I was - i was looking more forward to La Sagrada Familia. But once inside, I was completely blown away by Gaudi's ahead of his time thinking and designs. This was truly a forward-thinking genius. Learning how he came up with his engineering designs for some of his impossible looking structures was mind-blowing. Make sure you spend time learning about him and his genius in the 'Attic' exhibit which is excellently presented with models, film clips, photos, etc. The whole place felt like I had visited a house in Dr. Seuss-land and it made me wonder if Dr. Seuss had been influenced at all by Gaudi. I have a new-found appreciation and love of Gaudi's whimsy and brilliance after visiting here. Get the audio-guide for a few euros more; it's well worth it and quite interesting and informative. My only minor quibble was that it was very confusing where the tour started and how it progressed to match up with the audio guide, but once I figured it out, it was great! Don't forget to go to the rooftop and spend some time there early before the crowds hog up the photo opportunities. I also would like to address the other reviewers here who thought this was overpriced - I thought it was well worth it but if you buy an ArteTicket which is an all-inclusive price covering 5 museums PLUS Casa Mila, then it actually is a bargain; even if you only go to 2 museums of the 5 offered and this site, you're saving money. If these other travelers had done their homework, they wouldn't be complaining about the entrance fee. By the way, Casa Batlo is NOT included in the ArteTicket deal and is MORE expensive than Casa Mila."

However, once you enter this house, it is very intriguing. Amazing work, i was impressed with the house model. It looked so well thought of. Yes, light is an issue inside and taking pictures can be challenging. I dont remember carrying a tripod, but a monopod or tripod will be a good option. We took our time exploring the interiors and once we arrived at the roof, what a sight it was. It would give you an eerie feeling during full moon night. Luckily for us, the day was cloudy, and it drizzled for a while making the temperature lower. Lots of angles you can take photgraphs from. It is a photgrapher paradise and an obsessive photographer can spend the entire day in this place. Highly recommended to appreciate Anton Gaudi's work!"

It's not by chance that it's got his second name \"La Pedrera\" - \"stone quarry\". \"La Pedrera\" is very original not only for its facade, but for its interior. Everything is wave-shaped and the house really looks like graceful stone rock, whose balconies and windows look like small caves. I admired walking on its terrace, which is like fairy \"wild-life park\" and the beasts are its ventilation and chimney pipes, which are very unusual. We also visited a type of museum of the life of modernist style, which is organized in one of its appartments. We saw a baby-room with lots of olden time toys, a bed-room with big adult bed and a tiny cradle, a study, a bathroom and a kitchen/ It gave us a vivid understanding of old-times life. We'll never forget the feeling as if we had traveled through the time and touched a piece of life in the 1900s."

We went because the Sagrada Familia was closed for two days for the World Youth Festival and absolutley loved it. Get the lift to the top floor because there are a lot of stairs. Tehy take you initally to the roof terrace which has good views fo the city's rooftops as well as a good insight into the design of the building and its bizarre chimneys. Afterwards you go down into the attic which was my favourite part - an insight into the influences to Gaudi and some of the other buildings. You then go to the apartment which has several rooms furnished with contemporary but not original furnitureEven the shop is terrific and quirky"

We preferred wandering the streets and seeing the variety of architecture. La Pedrera was our one concession to the hype, paying the full admission and buying the audio guide so we could check out the museum. We weren't disappointed. The audio guide gives a great synopsis of Gaudi's style and method, but for us, highlights were the amazing, slightly trippy rooftop and the incredible refurbished apartment inside. Definitely worth the lines and the price."

The loft below the rooftop is also wonderfully executed, evoking organic forms and feeling very much like moving through the belly of a snake. I was surprised by how much time I spent in this remarkable space.Surprisingly, the least interesting section for me was the actual apartment.

La Padrera is very cool from the exterior, but the interior is sort of boring (you can only go in the attic). It's a huge building, yet 90% of it you can't get into see. They do have guides at every elevator to help direct traffic, which is good. The roof is very cool, however lots of stairs, so be in good shape to get around."

We tried to get in the front and was barked at by a member of the staff who told us it was the exit. Then we tried to enter thru the gift shop but was told again by rude staff that we couldn't get in that way. Please keep in mind that we have tickets in our hand during this whole process and showing them to the staff as they continued to turn us away without telling us where the entrance is. Once inside the interior was nothing spectacular compared to Casa Batllo. It was the roof that was the main attraction for us. It was spectacular. This place is a must see just try to ignore the rude staff."

The tour starts with the roof and to an extent is all down hill from there! The chimneys and view from the roof were literally breathtaking. Those great mosaic lumps looking like dragons with their backs turned to you from whatever angle you view them from, the plain 'helmeted' ones and those sprinkled with bottle shards.Then to the ribbed attic and the period flat all quite spectacular, but that roof, that roof. Go in the winter, we visited in January, walk straight in - no queue and no leaves on the trees so that external views (of any building) are unobstructed."

The Casa Pedrera is a true wonder in Barcelona, and a real source of happiness for Gaud\u00ed\u00b4s lovers\u2026After having seen the exuberant front of the house, go and have a look at the fanciful roof; the mask-shaped chimneys remind of Catalan Knights legends, and the convoluted chimneys made of ceramic are examples of Gaud\u00ed\u00b4s avant-gardism of the 90s. Then, go down the beams to understand the 20th century architectural conceptions. What is particularly fascinating is that not only the roof is typical and overview the whole city, but also the fact that we learn a lot about the architect who worked using weight on threads and he also used a mirror to get the reflection of the building. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the residential floor, the Mila Family one, is of little interest. The Pedrera house is half the price of the next door house (only 8euros for students), the Balto House, and is a must-do for all the travelers!"

We used a coupon from Bus Turistic & paid 8,50 Euro...without the coupon the cost is 9,50 Euro, both include the audio guide in choice of Catalan, Spanish, English, French, Portuguese, German, Italian, Basque & Galician. Hours: March to October, 9 am to 8 pm. There are 2 small lifts that bring you to the roof or the apartment if you don't want to walk. There is a gift shop. From the outside the curved facade & balconies catch your eye enticing you to go in & explore. The vaulted Attic museum with its 270 brick arches forms skeletal corridors and is dedicated to the architect, the unique furnished museum apartment reconstructs a typical bourgeois Modernista flat of late 19th century Barcelona & the spectacular roof with its rambling stairs, whimsical chimneys resembling medieval warriors & great views over the Eixample are not to be missed. This building was Antoni Gaudi's last major work. In 1984, UNESCO declared La Padrera (Casa Mila) a World Heritage Site."

On our last day - cases packed & awaiting collection - we chose to go to La Ped (the other 2 nearby houses - one covered from head to toe in a blue tarp, the other too expensive) for our 3rd Gaudi experience (SF Cath & Parc done before) in 6 days. We'd been to Sitges the day before to replenish the lungs & smile at the Med, after a fair bit of rain. I think it's important not to feel you HAVE to 'do it all' in Barca.Most of the reviews below say what needs saying - the loft allows one to float about in a relaxing informative space, the apartment is so-so; the high point is doubtless the roof. One has to be careful not to become too obcessed with finding the perfect photo, as people-free as possible; well they will insist on 'cluttering' up the arches & dramatic roof furniture :) It was lovely to say farewell to SF in the distance from the sunny roof. There is a v disturbing description in French below of organised gangs pick pocketing in the apartment loo area - though we resented the way crime warnings almost made us paranoid before arrival I repeat it here in case it saves one unfortunate English speaker."

After seeing the \u20ac16.50/person entrance fee at Casa Batllo, my fiancee and I walked 2-3 blocks up the street to La Pedrera, another much bigger Gaudi apartment building from the same decade where we had an easier time with the \u20ac8/person entrance fee.The audio guide tour was excellent, very well organized and extensive. It covered not only La Pedrera, but also Gaudi the man and all of his major works in and around Barcelona...including Casa Batllo, La Sagrada Familia, and others. There are a number of multi-language multi-media displays, models, replica furniture, and more that inspired us later to visit Casa Batllo anyway (much to our disappointment...see my separate review).Visitors have access to the building's ground floor entrance, gorgeous vaulted attic (where the bulk of the exhibit is), full roof with stunning chimneys, and an entire apartment which is fully outfitted in period furnishings. There's a lot of scaffolding up at the moment for renovation work on the roof and interior light well, but it didn't detract too much from the visit.In short, an excellent place to spend a few hours of your Barcelona visit and great compliment to exhibit at the Sagrada Familia."

After deciding to see just the Casa Batllo from the outside, I paid to see inside Casa Mila because I had heard so much about the roof. I was impressed by the outside - the balconies carry on the acquatic theme of Casa Batllo and look like seaweed. You start off in the amazing attic, where you can learn all about Gaudi's life and buildings (I suspect similair info would be in Casa Batllo which is why I decided not into go to both... I may be wrong of course). Next ascend to the amazing roof which is full of large and small chimneys and walkways criss-crossing the vast apartment block. The small chimneys look like Jedi knights. There is a great view of Barcelona - you can see the Sagrada Famiglia cathedral a few blocks away and a skyscraper that reminds me of the London \"Gherkin\" Swiss Re building. After spending way too long on the roof, I ventured down into the open apartment. It's like a tube apartment which goes right round the apartment block, so you can walk around in the circle, visiting all the rooms before ending back where you started. It was full of art deco furniture and lots of windows. Absolutely stunning. I can definately recommend this as one of the top attractions of Barcelona. Even if you're not an architecture buff, you'll be impressed by the structure."

One thing I will say is that it's ALWAYS open -- I toured at 6 pm- 8:30 pm on a Sunday night. The courtyard and entrance is breathtakingly beautiful and the apartment is OK although lacking the whimsy of Casa Batllo. Loved the museum installation in the attic (and the attic itself) and the roof looked cool but couldn't go up because of the rain. :-(Fortunatly I did go up on the roof of Batllo and there are lots of pics of Casa Mila's roof. The attic also has a nice wide window and skylight where you can see the main chimneys.From what I saw if I had to choose between Casa Mila and Casa Batllo I would take Casa Batllo, absolutely. Still, La Pedrera IS worth a look."

The roof is a playland of weird and interesting architectural shapes that cannot be described. Go see it! You also can view the La Sagrada Familia temple from the roof, right down Calle Provenza.

My last day in Spain I had a choice to make - I could go with friends to Montserrat, the cathedral to hear the boys choir and have paella on the beach or trek to the Picasso Museum and try to see as much Gaudi as possible.It had been raining for an entire week and the idea of more wet and cold on a mountain lost out to wet and cold in the city where I could duck in for a coffee when warmth was needed.I'm sorry I missed Montserrat but I found a cathedral in the sky in Gaudi's La Pedrera/Casa Mila. The fantastical work of Gaudi became beautiful and serene in the attic under the roof. Wonderful job of presentation combining models and video, music and views. Cost is 7Euro to visit the apartment replica, the attic and the roof - definitely worth it. Well trained quides within the building.Amazing courage of Gaudi's patrons is to be lauded.
