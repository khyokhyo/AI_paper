We picked a perfect day to go because it was pretty empty so getting our photos was a snap! ;) This was something new for both of us so we thoroughly enjoyed it!"

After learning it was $25 each to enter , not even in pesos , we walked away, turned off.We came back .....and we were generously rewarded with Martins personal attention. WORTH IT"

When you enter the museum you are required to remove your shoes walk with your sock or nylons that they provide. The museum has two hallways that are sectioned off by art work area and also indicates where the photographer should stand and were the person posing should stand. On the day of our visit there was no one else visiting and I honestly loved it because we had no one rushing us and we took as many pictures as we wanted to. We were there for about 1hr 1/2 and enjoy all the neat family pictures we took."

The tricky part is getting the right angles when taking the pictures, be sure to bring a decent camera. We went quite late in the evening and had about 2 hours to explore, which i believe is just enough time. A tour guide came and found us and took pictures for us as he said he knew the best angles. The only thing i wernt best pleased about is that he kept telling us how to pose, which did take some of the fun away for us. All in all, a good place to go and visit and have a laugh, also a an interesting place to visit if you are interested in art."

Very easily accessible and located centrally and for us was a short cab drive from our resort. Entry was 25 usd per adult ( children below 5 don't pay) In all there are 43 art works and each of them have a pointer on the floor from where pictures can be clicked. In our case one of the staff, a young chap from Ukraine (sorry I am unable to recollect his name) was very helpful and took pictures of us at EVERY art work. He must have spent an hour with us and then said he will leave us to spend more time by ourselves. I believe the staff are generally very helpful in this place. We must have spent a good part of 3 hours in total including the commute. Worth the money and time but only if you are into contemporary art and seek something different."

Not ideal as you wouldn't be able to take your time at each picture and you would end up with lots of people in the backgrounds of your photos. There were only 2 other groups of people there when we went so it was very relaxed. As it was so quiet we were able to have the brilliant Eric come round with us. He was so helpful. He helped show us the positions to stand/sit for different pictures and he took lots photos for us too. We have so many amazing photos that people love to look at. We had a fantastic time, it was well worth the money and my daughter aged 12 loved it to. It is amazing to think that just 1 artist created all these pictures.This place is really worth the visit."

It was nothing like that, it is the 3D artwork created by Street artists that you can become a part of. For that reason, I did not take a camera with us, I was an idiot! Carlos, one of the guide entrance staff, kindly lent us his mobile phone and then emailed us all the images we took, at no additional charge, amazing. My wife and I had fun posing for the pictures, as they are unique in their presentation and we would highly recommend if you have kids. I would also recommend taking a tripod and a camera that has a timer option, this is what we are going to do next time we go. You will have fun and it is not far from 5th Avenue, so make it part of one of your days out."

However, he nicely arranged that I could return within a week and the kids would be free. I would have to pay for myself. Overall, an ideal visit is one where you have 2+ hours to pose with the whole family and let the guides help/take the pictures. They are there to help you pose and make the pictures the best they can be. It's an expensive experience, but worth it for the hands-on experience getting my kids involved with a different form of art."

Our family and friends at home are amazed -- they thought the pics are the result of a \"green screen\" with PhotoShop editing. But they are raw photos from my iPhone!Our guide Carlos was wonderful walking along with us to all the paintings and showing us subtle hints to optimize each photo and providing various photo options to make the painting come alive. He also took several pictures so the 4 of us could be in the scene. Make sure to watch the documentary at the entrance if you can spare about 20 minutes to provide background on the artist's early days as a street chalk painter, but it's not necessary if you're short on time and want to directly go interact with the paintings.We visited on a Thursday at 2:30pm when the weather was nice so the museum was almost empty which was great and allowed us to take our time. But then it started to rain and more people arrived toward the end of our visit. so I suggest you call ahead to see how busy they are and if you're flexible consider visiting early morning or at night since they are open until late.We've been visiting Playa every 1-2 years since 2000 and are so pleased this Museum is there. We plan to return with other family members when we go back to Playa next summer!"

He perfectly guided us through the different rooms, setting us up and helping us get the perfect shots! What a blast, we were laughing like mad at how silly we felt but the pictures were gold. I'd definitely go back. I'd recommend for kids but not too young. They probably wouldn't appreciate it as much as older ones. It's not cheap but worth the visit."

You really need a camera to enjoy this experience, and it is kind of like some places where they dress you up to match the period or theme of the place, and you enjoy the pictures later, but Carlos made it fun to pose and create special imigrary. I really enjoyed it, but I could see that it requires a certain level of an artistic eye that not all will have. I'm going to go on and rave about Carlos because he really took the time to help me shoot pictures that I couldn't on my own and offered suggestions, but let me be creative as well. Dedicate some time and effort to this place and you will be rewarded."

Helpful staff who will tell you the best places to stand for the best effect and will even follow you around to take photos (although I am not sure whether this level of service will be available at the busiest times). There are also helpful markers on the floor which indicate where to stand to get the best results from photos.Would recommend although is quite expensive at \u00a320 per person."

Needless to say it is not easy to find as there are not but one sign and it sends you in the wrong direction. So for all that want to go it is located in a small shopping mall below the movie theator. Enter the building on the side you find the parking lot. There may not be anyone there and you will need to go into the theator to find someone. Good luck hope they fixed the AC."

The exposition is not terribly big, but with kids it's barely enough to see all the scenes, and to take two-three pictures at most of them (but not all), especially during peak season. There is also a video about the museum, which we skipped amid the time shortage. Give yourself about 2 hours so you can make the most of it (like taking really cool pictures). You will be asked to take off your shoes. Take the black socks they give you - I kept my own (white-colored), and it didn't look pretty on the pictures.The price for tourists is double of the price for residents - $25 versus $12.5 (American dollars, not pesos)."

A guide comes around with you and takes all your pictures for you. He also assists with the photo arrangement. Great way to spend a few fun hours with your family day or night, rain or shine. They are open from 9 am to 10 pm. Worth every penny! GO!"

I had so much fun with my friends and everyone became a child again!!! You have to go with friends or family to share the fun with and move camera in different angles to get the best 3 dimensional effect, but the fun is extraordinary! The painter is genius! I knew some of his paintings from all around the world, but having so much of his work under one roof and the short move about him in the beginning at the cinema, that you have to pass before going to the exhibition- is very educating, interesting and fun. For me it is a place I can definitely come back to few times with a huge pleasure, as I still don't get it how the painter is doing it and the playtime being there is endless! Must see!"

Make sure your camera or cell phone is fully charged as it it easier to see the 3D effect of artwork through a lens. Guides are available to help you with pictures and information about the artwork.You will be asked to remove footwear in order to enter gallery. You may want to pack a pair of socks if you are worried about getting a chill. Signage on outside of building is a bit hard to see unless you are looking for it. We went on a Sunday, a couple hours before closing. It was quieter and admission was 2 half price. Not sure if that promotion was for residents only or both residents and tourists. We enjoyed our visit and we recommend it to anyone looking for something to do indoors in Playa Del Carmen."

            "review": "Don't Miss Out On This Experience. We live in Cancun and made the drive down to Playa today to check out this new attraction. Well worth the drive. Locals get 50% off on Sundays which makes it quite accessible for those of us who earn pesos and not US dollars. For Americans and Europeans the price is very reasonable. Be sure to take socks because although they give out small pantyhose footwear they had run out and the floors are very cold. It's a great way to spend an hour or two being wowed by the 3D artwork and to capture some great images. Make sure you take a camera! They have staff on-hand to point out the best angles to get the best effects my only suggestion is that they should be wearing t-shirts that identify that they are working there because at first it feels somewhat obtrusive when someone comes up to you and starts telling you what to do without knowing that they work there.Also, because they place is fairly new there aren't too many people right now while you go through the various exhibits so you can really get the most out of the experience which is completely interactive. Perhaps they should consider, for the future, having people go in small organized groups with an allotted time for each exhibit so that you can get the most out of each exhibit which requires time to set-up the photo and really understand what is going on in the image. I would hate to imagine what it would be like once there are lots of people all trying to take photos of each exhibit. Some planning will be required.That being said we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and plan to go back again but the next time with socks and a better camera and a GoPro to see what we can do with them."
