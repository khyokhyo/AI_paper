From our very first email exchange to the end of the trip it was an unbelievable experience. Ali works hard to tailor make the trip to your need and does a great job !Selects a good mix of accommodations to give you the best experience. He delivers to the finest detail and at a very reasonable price. No surprises ! We had Khalid as our guide and driver and he was amazing. A very humble, respectful man and an extremely responsible driver. We felt at great ease with him driving around Morocco. He would go the extra mile to make every minute of our trip memorable and always with a smile even after some very long days of driving. We would highly recommend him.Morocco is a mystical country and Camel Safaries did an excellent job in making it a magical experience for us."

I couldn't have expected better, Mustapha and Hassan were the kindest and most professional people we met in Morocco. The Sahara was completely infatuating. This tour was life changing, eye opening and all because of the great efforts both Mustapha and Hassan went through to make it that way. Don't miss out! But be aware, it's a lot of driving. If you want to experience the desert and mountains as you see it on films and in games, take this trip. You won't regret it. Thanks so much for the life changing experience.Ryan & Charlotte"

            "review": "We Couldn't Have Been Happier. This review is long overdue, but we enjoyed our tour so much that I had to write it. My husband and I did a week-long tour around a large portion of Morocco. Ali was very responsive and willing to create a customized itinerary for us, including picking us up at the airport. The price was very reasonable and the experience exceeded our expectations in all aspects. Mohammed was a terrific driver and guide. He gave us great recommendations for food and took us to interesting locations. He made sure to stop if we wanted to take photos, go to the restroom, or get something to eat. He is friendly and very knowledgeable. We learned so much about culture, religion, and history in Morocco and Mohammed was happy to participate in an exchange of perspectives. The overnight trip in the desert was one that had been on my bucket list, and the experience was truly incredible (although camels aren't very comfy to ride and I wouldn't recommend going any longer than a couple of hours on a camel). I especially loved meeting Mohammed's family and sharing food and tea with them. My husband and I have traveled a lot, usually by ourselves, but this tour was by far one of our favorite travel experiences. My husband had been a little nervous about visiting Morocco because he didn't really know what to expect, and he ended up loving it largely due to Mohammed making us feel so comfortable and well-informed."

Our tour guide mustaffah was so kind and spoke excellent English. He really went the extra mile when catering to our needs, he even bought us water when he knew we would need it and went back to a hotel to retrieve a necklace I had lost which I really appreciated. Our driver Hassan was also amazing, he drove excellently and was a very friendly guy. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone who wants to discover a bit more of morocco and doesn't mind long car journeys. My boyfriend and I did the 3 day 2 night Sahara desert tour which was a good amount of time to see everything we wanted to see. If going on this tour I would advise you bring some change for water as you are travelling for most of the day and change for toilets which usually cost about 2dh.Thank you for having us!Charlotte and Ryan"

Corresponded with Ali thru email and it was very simple to book and get information.We were picked up at our riad in Marrakech by Mustapha and the driver Hassan. They are both polite and friendly hosts and we felt very safe with them.The itinerary is sent to you in the email and all the hotel and transportation along the way is taken care of. The only expenses that are not covered are lunches and beverages. The hotels along the way are excellent.Mustapha and Hassan know all the places to stop for the best pictures and they have no problems being photographers.The highlight of the trip for me was riding the camels into the desert. The dunes are magical and it's truly a very unique experience.The only thing I would change is the lunch stops. We like more local options when we travel however we stopped at all the tourist friendly options which were full of tourists and not as authentic."

Our driver Hassan and guide Mustapha were beyond excellent! Must ask for them. Hassan is a very safe and courteous driver, while Mustapha was very knowledgeable explaining the culture and landscape of Morocco along the way in excellent English. Mustapha was also very thoughtful and considerate, anticipating our needs and made sure we were safe and comfortable at all times. He even gave us helpful tips on bargaining and what to watch out for in Marrakech. Both were very polite and reliable. We hope Hassan and Mustapha were able to spend more time with their family after dropping us off in Marrakech. They returned home from a tour prior to ours and had only one hour to spend with them before they were told that they had to be in Marrakech next day for us. Thank you for such a wonderful trip! \"Sa Ha\""

We shared the small group with a lovely couple from USA in a van. The drives were long however we had several stops along the way to stretch our legs and also take spectacular views from different vantage points. The terrain is diverse from Marrakech with an overnight stay in Dades Valley. Mustapha had so much knowledge about the Berber culture and Morocco and he also gave us a number of tips about local bargaining and what to be careful about. The Sahara was a beautiful and fun experience with the camel ride, sunset and sunrise. The food was sooo good. We had tagines and vegetables. We highly recommend Camel Safaries for tours in Morocco. They organise other trips around the country."

            "review": "Amazing but a few hiccups . We were two families - 4 adults and 4 teenagers. We booked 6 nights (3 in Marrakech and 3 going to and returning to desert)The desert portion we did firstOur guide for the desert portion was Mustapha he was amazing!!! The teenagers thought so highly of him- us adults thought he looked after us and every need he anticipated. The camel trek into the Sahara was undeniably surreal - again Mustapha personally made sure everything was looked after other people on our Sahara trek did not have a personal guide solely anticipating our needs and making sure we were happy. These three nights unbelievable book this tour FOR SUREThe hiccups came upon our return to Marrakech - this may be the loss of Mustapha as he is a desert tour guide and a let down after the camel highlightBut the accommodations in Marrakech which were suppose to be luxurious had problems - yes they moved us in rooms on 3 occasions in 1 night ( no air con, toilet broken etc) not camel safaris fault and they even offered to move to a different hotel but overall the next nights in Marrakech drastically paled in comparison to the first 3. The city tour quite frankly boring, we needed recommendations or help for dinner and basically relied on trip advisor....Overall the company was very good but the riad Bahia Salam (think boutique hotel) in Marrakech notHowever Mustapha and the first 3 nights AMAZING!!!!Do this trip do this company and definitely request Mustapha"

It was indicated by a friend and they have surpassed my expectations. They are very punctual yet flexible. Truly care that you are pleased and are flexible to make changes on the way if you need. They really take care of everything and you do t have to worry about anything, but enjoying your journey and the breathtaking landscape and spiritual beauty of Morocco. I was traveling alone, as my travel purpose was self knowledge, but yet with Camel Safaries service and care I felt safe and confident all the time, without loosing my moments of introspection. I had a driver and guide that was with me the whole time. His name is Khalid, a young Berber man. He was definitely the perfect guide for me: extremely respectful, humble, honest, patient. Generous in sharing his knowledge, his culture and his passion for the Berber culture and music. Yet, Khalid knew how to respect my moments of silence. A careful driver, the kind you can take a quick nap in the car with no concerns. Also the company owner was touch basing with me the whole time, to guarantee I was pleased and having the best experience possible. A lifetime experience, with great learnings!"

Moroccans are warm and hospitable. I only wish we had more time to see more cities. This tour company is a fabulous value and I would recommend them and use them again and again."

            "review": "Amazing, beginning to end!. First things first, Camel Safaries is excellent from beginning to end...and the fact that the trip had to end was the only down side. Short version of our trip...book it, request Mustapha, enjoy and make many memories. The long version follows:My first point of contact was Ali through the company email. He always responded quickly and answered all of my questions. Since we (married couple in our 50\u2019s) had never visited Morocco or used a private guide, we had lots of questions. I\u2019m sure Ali was sitting back thinking \u201cmake this stop\u201d, but he was great. \uf04a At first I thought the price was a little on the high side, but once we finished our trip, we felt like it was more than worth it! We did the two nights, three day private trip Marrakech to Marrakech. We were met right on time at our riad in Marrakech by Mustapha. He has a great personality and speaks English very well. Throughout the trip he gave us information regarding the area, the customs and lifestyle of the various regions and even shared information about himself and his family. There are designated stops, but you are also welcome to ask to stop to see something that interest you along the way. At every stop, both Mustapha and the driver were there to open and close our car doors...gentlemen!Each time there was a view or site that took our breath way, we didn\u2019t think it could be topped...until the next stop. Our trip through the Atlas Mountains was unbelievable. We made many stops along the way to the Sahara. We paid a little more to have a couple of extras with no regrets. Our stop for the night at Dades was at the Kasbah Xhaloca. We usually stay at mom and pop type of places, but wow, this was amazing. Once we arrived at the Sahara dunes, we were able to relax before our trip into the desert for the night. The camels were an adventure of their own traveling the dunes! I don\u2019t know that I have ever experienced a more serene trip, it was so quiet and beautiful. Two guides led us and a few others to our bivouac where Berber tents were already set up. The food, music and company were excellent. It was a really hot night and we pulled out mattress out into the sand for the night. The next morning we rode the camels back to meet Mustapha and our driver for the long trip back to Marrakech. Although it was a long ride, we still made a few stops and Mustapha was a true guide to the end."

So me and a group of friends did a 4 day / 3 nights tour from Marrakech to Fez, passing through the desert. They picked us up at our riad in Marrakech and dropped us at our riad in Fez. Hassan was our safe and friendly driver and we really enjoyed meeting him. I feel blessed we got the luck to have Abdoul as our guide. He is very professional and knowledgeable, always ready and open to answer our questions and happy to help us with anything we might need along the way. Abdoul is always pumped up with good energy and will be a great friend to you along your tour. Couldn't ask for anything more. The tour we did was absolutely amazing. From driving through the mountains, to meet small villages, and the beautiful desert. If you are staying in the desert (beside from sleeping in the berber camp) I highly recomend you chose Auberge du Sud. What an amazing place. We felt really welcome and safe along the way. I'm glad we chose to go to Morocco and decided to book this tour, it would've been our loss (a big one) if we haven't done it. Don't hesitate to book!"

Making the deposit was easy through PayPal which helps.We were picked up by Hassan our driver and Mustapha our guide on time at he start of our trip. They were brilliant. Very knowledgeable and they had a great rapport together, bouncing off each other's knowledge which made them extremely entertaining and believe me you need this as you spend a great deal of time on the road and in a vehicle together.Hassan was a brilliant driver, which was comforting on some of he twisting roads you travel. Mustapha spoke excellent English and nothing was too much trouble.We did a four day trip, with hindsight, if you're only in Morocco for a week, the 3 day trip would be long enough.The whole trip was fantastic, the valleys, the scenery, the Kasbah's and the desert were all amazing. Morocco has a little bit of something for everyone. My favourite was definitely the desert, it was beautiful with sand so soft, I was in raptures which coming from someone who says they hate sand is something! What made the desert was the sunrise. Hats off to Mustapha who was the only guide to get us up early enough to climb the dunes to watch the sunrise, it was special, up there alone in the beauty of the sunrise. Thank you Mustapha for adding that special moment to our trip.Thank you Ali at Camel Safaris for arranging our trip and an even bigger thanks for Mustapha and Hassan, our fabulous guide and driver. They made our trip fabulous and we can't wait to return to Morocco again in the future."

I reached out to him once arriving in Marrakech to book our trip leaving in a couple days. Ali was quick in responding and customizing our travel as we were not coming back to Marrakech after the desert safari. Our guide, Anas, arrived at our riad on time for our 3 day, 2 night trip. He was very knowledegable and also answered many of our questions along the way:) Given that we were going from Marrakech to Fes over the course of our trip, the drive during the days was long, however, the time went by quickly as we had great laughs and did mini excursions along the way. Our first night, we stayed at Chez Pierre in the Dades Valley. Definitely one of the highlights of the trip due to their attention to customer service and ensuring a great experience for their guests. (I highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in the area!). The following day, we made our way to Erg Chebbi for our camel safari. We made it to the camp just in time to watch the sunset on the sand dunes, followed by dinner under the stars. By far the best experience on the trip...next to waking up the following morning watching the sunrise over the Sahara! The entire trip couldn't have gone any better and was well organized by Camel Safaries. Anas, our guide, was also very accommodating. We were to end our trip in Fes and then make our way to Casablanca the following day. Anas looked into it and was able to drive us there himself. He took great care of us and we had such a great experience as a result. He felt like a part of our group and the trip would not have been the same without him.I would highly recommend Anas and Camel Safaries team. They definitely made our trip a memorable one!"

We felt like we took at chance booking this tour as it was cheaper than most we had looked at for camping/mountains/camels but it was a good decision.A lot of time is spent in the car travelling to different places but not really an issue as you get to see a lot. You stop at many different places along the way so you can get a good look at the land. Our guide was very knowledgeable of Morocco and answered all of my (many) questions regarding the history, the people and the landscape.First night you slept at an absolutely amazing Riad on a hillside. The second night you the ride the camel to the large canvas tents within the dunes but we ended up just sleeping outside on the dune under the stars (after watching desert foxes by torch light - beautiful experience).Our guide was Mustapha who was absolutely brilliant! Our driver was Hasan who was also great fun. Both genuinely nice men.This tour would be great to do solo, as a couple or with family or friends. But would not recommend with young children as the driving stints can be long (all day) and I'd imagine they'd be really bored/tired."

We made a few stops along the way, visited unique sites and had lots of mint tea (yum!). He and our driver took great care of us. We loved talking with Mustapha about life in Morocco and the culture. We left the trip feeling like we made a new friend. He took good care to ensure we were comfortable at all times and that we got the most out of the tour.The experience once we got to dessert was something that we will remember forever. We rode camels out to our camp (mine coincidentally had the same name as my dog!). We ended up being the only visitors in the camp so we were very spoiled. The camp had comfortable tents with beds and even a bathroom with showers and toilets. I never felt like we were \"roughing it.\" Even the food was delicious! Mustapha gave us the option to get up early to catch the sunrise, which we did. Stunning! It's a once in a lifetime experience to watch the sunrise over the dunes of the dessert with camels in the background.I would recommend this tour for anyone. It's definitely an experience that shouldn't be missed!"

The amount of education we received about the area and the culture was outstanding. Also my partners luggage was lost as soon as we landed and after many phone calls, figuring who to talk to and how to get ahold of them, he worked out with his busy schedule after our tour to accommodate getting the luggage from Rabat to Marrakech because air France was useless to accommodate us. All in all I would of booked a longer trip with these people. I would recommend 100%. Amazing people, amazing trip, beautiful hotels, great food. Worth every euro/dollar/dirham"

I am the kind of person who prefers to travel on her own (backpacking) BUT, this time a group of friends (7 in total) decided to book a trip with Camel safaries and let them organize everything for us. The result: Amazing experience, unforgettable moments, cool pictures and the best, the opportunity to get to know the culture from the locals!! Normally I am sceptic when I book something online without a reference from someone I know, but I must say this tour was beyond our expectations: price, flexibility, punctuality, organization, hospitlity...all you could have asked for!We traveled 8 days from Fez down to Marrakesh, going through the Sahara Desert (wich for me was the best part of the trip for) and including the beach part, Essaouira, where we were lucky to enjoy the Gnoua Music Festival. These guys really do an awesome job. Everything was perfectly organized, the accomodation were veryyyy nice, clean and autenthic, the tours in the cities gave us an insight about the relegion, the history and the culture, the food was delicious and our driver, Anas, was the most friendly and nice person ever! He became part of our group!!! We saw many things in these 8 days and got a real taste of the hospitality and wonders of Morocco. We even had some cooking and traditional dancing classever I will definetely come back to Morocco and I can only recommend cammel safaries. You don't have to worry about ANYTHING and they really make your trip according to your interests, budget and time. "

Picked up on time by Ali in a nice 4x4 and headed for 4 day / 3 night tour to the desert and heart of Morocco (I would have even done 1 more day to go slower - probably sleep at Ait-Benhaddou). Hotels were great (and my wife is quite picky!), and staying at the Desert was great as well (with bed and lamp). Our driver Ali was great. We asked to meet his family at Risani and had lunch with them at their place. Always felt comfortable with him and he drives safely, and appears to know a lot of people. I totally recommend Camel Safaries. Thank you. The highlight of our trip!"

Our guide and driver did very well (his name was Idir) and we had a great comfort in the car. The lodging that was arranged was also better than expectations. Another good thing was that all the communication with the travel agency prior and during the trip was very quick and efficient. I would definitely recommend Camel Safaries."

Over all, the trip is well organised. All the stops we have made, they all have clean toilet and clean food. Before we have booked, we didn't realise how long it takes to go to Zagora. It is about 7 hours drive with 1 hour rest. The slight is amazing on the way tho! The atlas mountain is so beautiful, and full of colours. Our driver/guide is lovely, but he speaks only a bit English. I won't have minded, if when I first contact, they have promised to send a English speaking guide. The guide is also a bit ill (cold, I think) on the way there, and got worse (coughing) on the way back. We both have felt ill on the 2nd day back from the trip. It is just not very nice to be ill on holiday. It would be better if they didn't send someone who is unwell on the job. It's just that you spend 16 hours in the same car, it is difficult to avoid to it."

First of all Ali was extremely helpful and timely in his answers to our inquiry mails. Our guide came picking us up at our hotel in Marrakech, and the journey begun through different landscapes (the atlas, canyons, rocky desert and dunes desert). The stops were well placed and the hotels chosen very good (even in the cheapest version of the tour). Our guide was young but very Nice and I want to thank him (Mubarak) for all the explications, the help and the stories he told us. The experience to spend the night in the desert it's amazing. Don't worry the \"tent\" are very good with a real bed inside so you don't need to bring enything to feel confortable. Only thing the last day of the tour is a lot of driving so if you have the possibility I advice to make the 4 days tour that makes the going back easier.All in all an incredible experience (even if a little bit expensive) but worth to do at least once in a lifetime."

            "review": "3 Day 2 Night Marrakech to Marrakech tour. My wife and I booked a 3 day 2 night trip. Ali, the organizer was very prompt in his replies and any questions we had. We paid 310 euros per person for a mid level accommodations. There was an option for budget accommodations for 280 euros per person as well. 1st day: Mohammed, our driver and guide, picked us up at our Riad at 8am. We went to the Atlas Mountains, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of A\u00eft Benhaddou (site of movies) , and Rose valley. Most of the stops were just a 3-5 min stop where we would take some pictures of the background. It would've been nicer if Mohammed would explain a little bit of the significance of each stop so we can appreciate the scenery a little more. Overnight, we stayed at a very nice hotel with dinner included. 2nd day: We went to the Todra Gorge and we were able to trek along the Gorge for around half an hour. It was a very nice hike with wonderful views of the gorge. Afterwards, we went to some fossil museum and other little shops. Around 3pm, we arrived at the hotel where we would take the camel trek. The highlight of the whole trip was taking the camel trek to the dessert and sleeping in the tent overnight. 3rd day: The last day is pretty much a car drive all the way back to Marrakech. It was a 10-11 hour drive straight with pit stops for washroom stops/lunch break. Pro: The whole trip was worth it for just for the camel trek, sand dunes and sleeping in the dessert. Everything else was just bonus.Con: A LOT of driving. 3rd day was pretty much all driving. Be prepared for that. Wish the guide/driver Mohammed would've came out of the car at the stops and explained the sites a little more."

Ran into a bit of trouble weather-wise; the Atlas Mountains were completely snowed out so we had to go around the entire mountain range which extended our first day from like, 4 hours of driving to closer to 10. Thankfully our driver Abdul and the rest of our group was absolutely fantastic about everything, and Abdul did a tremendous job of adapting to the issues that arose. The sights we saw, people we met, things we did, and food we ate were all of top quality, and I even liked it so much that I proposed to my girlfriend on the trip! Started the tour with a girlfriend and ended with a fiancee; you can't really ask for much better than that. I would 100% recommend taking a trip with these folks."

As a solo female traveler, I felt more than comfortable, and I would recommend this tour to anyone who is travelling to Morocco (whether you are alone or with friends). I learned a ton about local Moroccan cultures and customs as well as fun facts, jokes and proverbs. The trip was evenly paced in that driving periods were not too long and breaks were just the right amount of time to stretch and see some sights. The first day involved going through the High Atlas mountains, visiting the Ait Benhaddou kasbah, learning history and posting up at a guest house in the Dades Valley. The guest house was fantastic. Great food, awesome views, friendly staff. The second day involved visiting the Todra Gorges and driving through some of the most remarkable mountain and desert settings on our way to the Erg Chebbi dunes. The camel ride was so fun, and the sunset and sunrise from the dunes were gorgeous. The camp was more like \"glamping\", which was a pleasant surprise. We had dinner in the camp, but breakfast was at the Kasbah Mohayut (where we launched the camel trek from). The staff is very friendly there, and the food was delicious. The third day was all about driving back to Marrakech and stopping along the way to see beautiful oasis scenes.  This tour was life-changing, and it made me want to stay in Morocco for a longer trip. I can't thank Mohammed enough for being the best guide and friend. I will be back, and I'm happy to call Morocco one of my favorite places in the world. If you're wondering whether or not you should go on this tour, do it. Absolutely do it. You'll be grateful you did."

I've been in many places and seen a lot, but I'm still excited about what we have seen and enjoyed in Morocco. And it wouldn\u2019t be possible without our fantastic tour guide Ali.Morocco completely shattered my initial perception of it \u2013 for me Morocco is a great contrast country \u2013 during 10 days we enjoyed so lot - the snow, the sun, the desert, mountains and power of Atlantic Ocean. Fantastic landscapes, people, regardless of the circumstances in which perhaps the majority of them live in - are open, positive and pleasant.Picnic in the Sahara desert, camel safari and night in the Sahara desert under the stars, off-road trip in the Atlas mountains, meeting with nomads and so much else. Each city, which we has seen its path with its charm, all of them are well worth seeing and unforgettable. Each accommodation where we stayed during our trip is noteworthy. My advice is to use these small Riads, rather than look for classic hotels. If you want to feel flavors of Morocco you have to try night at small and nice riad (for example in Marrakech we spent the night at riad de I\u2019Orientale - a charming place).And of course, if we are talking about Morocco, we have to talk about Moroccan cuisine - tagines, taktouka, fruits, olives, dates, fantastic sweets, ooo, I enjoyed every of them!Our trip was so opulent impressions and emotions that I still live in these emotions although I\u2019m already away from Morocco. I hope it will be enough with these memories and emotions to wait till the next time when I could return there and continue enjoy the various colors, tastes and sensations of Morocco. But I\u2019m sure, I will visit Morocco once again.Thanks Morocco, Camel Safaries and especially to Ali for leaving so pleasant footprints in our souls."

First, Camel Safaris worked with us to tailor our itinerary so it was just right for us. They were by far the best price and the best with communication. We knew exactly what we were getting, while other companies (and we talked to a bunch) were vague and noncommittal. They definitely had the best value for money. We had a very comfortable vehicle that made the long trip easy, and the planned stops broke up the itinerary in a way that kept things interesting. Everything we saw was fascinating and beautiful. The kids especially had a blast riding camels into the desert dunes to the camp. But I reserve my highest praise for our driver Hassan and our guide Lahcen. They were so friendly and playful with the kids, and they were informative, helpful and flexible in a way that really made the trip shine for us. Thanks!"

I asked if he is buying for his sister that stays near fes, it isn't. He was buying to feed the stray dogs on the way to fes. As my girlfriend is a dog lover, we did to same thing.

The hotel we stayed on the first night was really good. On the next day we took our quadricycles to get to the camp, which, in my opinion, was a much better choice (I think they might have bugees as well, but, either way, you have to ask for it in advance).

We aren't \"guided tour\" type of people but due to the little time we had in Morocco and the distance it took to get to the Sahara, we decided it would be best. I did a LOT of research for this trip and based on reviews, we went with Camel Safaris. It was one of the best choices we made in planning our trip to Morocco. Fair prices and excellent communication with Ali. Mohammad, our guide, was nothing short of perfect! He was very friendly, kind, helpful, fun, knowledgeable, and easy to talk to. On Day 1 he picked us up @8am from our riad and spent the day driving and sightseeing along the way. He would stop anytime we asked for photos or otherwise. We toured Ben Ait Haddou (amazing!) - Mohammad gave us an introduction and then let us explore on our own. It was very interesting to drive through many small towns and stop to observe a few Berber villages, all while Mohammad gave us information and answered all of our questions. We stayed at Riad Itran that night, and wow!! was it fantastic! It was our favorite accommodation during our entire trip around Morocco. Beautiful location, charming riad, warm and friendly staff and delicious food. Day 2 we continued our drive through oases and palmeries and a second kasbah that is setup as a museum.We arrived to our camels where we met our guides and camels. We trekked in before sunset. Yes, it was about as cool as you could imagine. The kids played on the dunes until dark when we were served a delicious tagine dinner and mint tea. The camp in a permanent site with individual pods with actual beds and electricity in them. We were not expecting that! It was very cold that night but with 5 blankets, we were very warm. We played drums around the fire that night and watched what little stars we could since it was cloudy :( The next morning we climbed up the dunes to watch the sunrise before packing up and heading back out. The camel ride was only about 1 hour each way. I would have liked it to be a little longer. The camp itself is on the edge of the Sahara really - you could see the town in the distance when looking west. On our return drive we had to pass through the snowy Atlas Mts - the Berber villages we saw on Day 1 were covered in snow! Luckily the roads had been cleared enough to let us through. We returned to Marrakesh about 8pm that evening. Amazing and well organized trip. I highly recommend this company to anyone!!!"

He met me at the riad I had stayed at in Marrakech, and we set off on our journey from there. Mohammed made me feel comfortable immediately. We became fast friends as the first day was about 4 hours in the car, driving along the winding roads that climb through the beautiful Atlas Mountains and through a number of small towns. The sights along the way were amazing - gorgeous mountains, the kasbah at Ait-Ben-Haddou, the dwellings made of mud and clay, grazing goats and more. I could have taken thousands of pictures and felt it wasn't enough! Mohammed is a knowledgeable guide, and I fear I didn't ask enough questions of him, as we were having too much fun swapping stories about our lives. A highlight of this first day was when we stopped so I could take pictures of a herd of goats, and the goat herder invited us to have tea with him. We sat with him on the ground while he made a small fire and then made the tea. He had one small glass, and we all drank from it. It was a pretty special moment for me! That evening, we stayed at the hotel Kasbah Itran. The hotel overlooks the Rose Valley. We had dinner here, and then the staff and Mohammed played the drums and sang. We all ended up dancing in a circle together while singing, clapping and/or playing the drums. What a fun night! Here, I had an amazing room with stained glass windows and a view over the Valley. This was facing east, and the sunrise was stunning. After our breakfast, we started off for our journey into the desert. We stopped to look at the town Boumalne Dades at the edge of the Dades Valley - such an amazing view. This town looks like an elaborate sand castle against a backdrop of palm trees and the Atlas Mountains. We also stopped in the spectacular Todgha Gorge which was carved by the Todgha and Dades Rivers. After an authentic lunch of cous cous (it was Friday) in the town of Rissani, we continued on to the edge of the Sahara Desert, where we got on our camels for our ride (just over an hour) into Erg Chebbi - one of Morocco's two Saharan ergs - sand dunes. The camel ride was fun and easy(for me) and the camel was very well-behaved. This part of the desert is amazing - vast and with high dunes - just what I wanted to see! Mohammed and I climbed a dune near our camp; this may have been easy for my new friend, but not for me!!! But I was happy to do it for the great view! The tent camp is very comfortable - with rugs on the sand, a bathroom with running water, even a dining tent. I had my own tent of course, and the bed was comfortable and had plenty of blankets! That night we had a great dinner and then sat around a campfire until very late playing the drums and singing. The next morning, I climbed that dune again in order to watch the sunrise over the desert. This was another special moment! After that, we got back on the camels and went back to the edge of the desert where we had a hearty breakfast before heading on our long trek (8-9 hours) back to Marrakech. We had stops along the way, including lunch in an interesting town that was having its weekly market, and an area that was filled with fossils embedded into the rocks. This trip was amazing, filled with special experiences. As we neared the end, I was very sad as it meant saying goodbye to my great new friend, Mohammed. He made this trip the best it could be for me! it is clear Mohammed enjoys his job! He is personable, friendly, informative and thoughtful. He also takes great photos - hand him your camera or your smart phone and let him take some great pictures of you on this trip. I would highly recommend Camel Safaries to anyone - the experience was beyond my expectations. I want to do this again!!!"

He was extremely nice well versed, and just completely understanding and hospitable when it comes to giving you a good tour. So if you're going to morocco and you're going to do a tour but want some flexibility and a completely easy to do tour then this is the one!"

We had a lot of laughs. They were very open to customisation during our trip. Mohammed took us to an amazing local restaurant to avoid the tourist traps. The accommodation (both hotels and Saharan camp) were perfect. Probably the highlight was the camel ride across the Sahara to stay 1 night in a Saharan camp. The camp itself had comfortable beds, plenty of blankets, and warm running water. We sat by the camp fire in the evening singing and playing music with the staff. We also got to see a great variety of Moroccan scenery and sites. I highly recommend Mohammed and Hasan to anyone considering a tour."

From the moment that our guide Abdoul and our driver Hassan picked us up in Marrakech, we knew we were in good hands. The 4x4 car was clean and comfortable and the journey, while long, never felt arduous. Hassan was an excellent driver and we felt safe the whole time. Abdoul is simply the best guide. He is knowledgable, friendly, professional and clearly loves his job. I fell ill during the trip and we were really impressed with the care taken to ensure I got medication I needed (despite many of the pharmacies being closed).Abdoul was incredibly flexible and allowed for customization along the route. Once we indicated that we enjoyed eating the local food, we got to experience a real Moroccan treat of grilled lamb in a local cafe! We thoroughly enjoyed the itinerary set out by Camel Safaries and felt that the stops were well thought out and well timed. The hotels that we were booked on were perfect. Small and intimate with lovely staff and delicious food. We ate extremely well on this trip!Ali was also extremely responsive and flexible during the planning stage. All in all, we cannot recommend this company or our guides Abdoul and Hassan enough... simply amazing!"

This trip completely exceeded our expectations and has been by far the highlight of our Morocco trip.Mohammed, our guide was an absolute star- he's one of the most genuine, friendly, kind people you will ever meet. He makes the journey interesting as he provides knowledge along the way to break up the long drives. He's so upbeat which is infectious, and we loved his camel dancing. He went above and beyond as he really cares that you enjoy your trip, and he really does become like a good friend.We felt in very safe hands with our driver Hassan, as he is a great driver- very safe and we didn't even flinch driving up the mountain roads with high drops (in other countries with similar roads I've resorted to closing my eyes in fear but this time I could enjoy the view!) Hassan is also a really friendly, helpful person and he and Mohammed make a great team.Booking our trip was easy, as Ali responded to all of my emails quickly and clearly, which assured me that I'd picked the right company for this trip as there seems to be a lot of choice! The hotel we stayed at for the first night was lovely, way nicer than we expected for the price! And the Berber camp on the second night was also beyond our expectations- we expected (and would have been happy with) basic facilities, but this was practically glamping- we had a real bed, real flushing toilets, amazing food and a magical evening under the stars! Thank you so much Camel Safaries! We will definitely be recommending this trip to all of our friends."

At the suggestion of another couple, we booked our tour with Ali Oussou's company, Camel Safaris. Best decision we could have made. We did the 5 night tour, which included a night in the Erg Chebbi Dunes. and everything was spectacular. Our tour guide was Mohammed, and he was just great. He gave great commentary on the area, the people and culture and could answer our questions; he knew when to pull over so we could take pictures and every lunch restaurant we went to was delicious!The tour itself was well organized. All hotel and travel arrangements were made in advance; Ali even booked our hotel in Marrakesh for us (we stayed 2 extra nights after the tour in the city). Ali himself was timely with all email responses both before and after the tour - it was really wonderful to go on a trip and not have to worry about anything - they did a superb job. It was our first time in Marrakesh and it could not have been a more pleasant trip. The people were friendly, the food was excellent - I highly recommend both the country and Camel Safaris."

It was well organised and interesting but more than that my friend, son and I were treated like friends or family, not just clients. Right from start Ali was great with communication when organising and planning the tour and patiently responded to my many emails. The four day tour that we went on was amazing and a great mix of things such as a camel trek at Erg Chebby dunes, feeding monkeys at a forest, seeing amazing sites and visiting local people and a local market. There was flexibility as well, for example, in whether we wanted to do some shopping and where we wanted to eat. We really enjoyed the local food places that we were taken to. Even though we travelled long distances, it was comfortable in the four wheel drive, the scenery was amazing and our guide/driver Mohammed kept it interesting for us. He is a very friendly, funny guy who knows the country and the culture very well and we learnt so much from him. The hotels that we stayed at were great as well and the staff were very friendly. Our time with Camel Safaries was easily the best part of our trip to Morocco even though we enjoyed the whole trip and it was the best holiday I've had. Thanks to Mohammed and Ali for a great holiday that I'll never forget."

By advance planning through examination of their website and also e-mail correspondence with owner Ali, all arrangements were made and executed beautifully. Since our group consisted of just my wife and I, we were assigned a Toyota Land Cruiser 4x4 with Guide Mostapha and driver Hassan for this 3 day, 2 night desert tour. Both were excellent and friendly, and there was no language issues as Mostapha spoke good English and Driver Hassan understood and could communicate directly or thru Mosptapha. The details of the itinerary are given on the website, so will not repeat here. The first day highlight was a visit to the world famous Kasbah Ben Houdou where over 25 Hollywood films were filmed. These include the iconic Lawrence of Arabia, The Gladiator, Pearls of Persia, Game of Thrones, etc. Just a word of caution: lunch at the supposedly \"best\" restaurant in this village was a disaster! Better to bring a packed lunch with you. Not the fault of Camelsafaries as all tour buses/cars stop at this place. Food here is really bad. The kasbah trek made up for the bad food, and the information given by our guide Mostapha was invaluable. The hotel Xaluca dades on the first night had excellent buffet dinner and equally good breakfast. Wi-fi works only in the hotel lobby and not in the rooms. But the loacation of the hotel and the food were both excellent! The second day highlight was a trip to the gorge, lunch at our guide Mostapha's home near the desert. His sister Zahara cooked us an excellent covered Pizza, with salad and starter almonds and other nuts. The next day, our driver Hassan's sister cooked for us a really spicy similar pizza to take away and eat while we were driving. Both these acts of kindness more than made up for the bad lunch on the first day. Such acts of friendliness endeared us to both Mostapha and Hassan, and were not part of the package. the highlight was the camel ride from the Camp Mohayut to the sand dunes desert berber tent! What an adventure for us two senior citizens aged 70! The sand dunes of Erg Chebbi are not to be missed! Well worth the long 550kms drive from Marrakech! The dinner was very good as was the company of international travellers in our group fro this segment for the trip. On the way to the desert, while drivi g, our driver Hassan took full advantage of the 4x4 car and took us off road for long periods. We were able to visit and desert camp made by Berber nomads and see their basic, rustic life-style and how they make their living rearing goats, etc. back at the sand dunes camp, sunset and sunrise were sights to behold! After dinner entertainment was provided by our three camelguides/cook through playing drums around a bonfire on the sand dunes. Lying on our back viewing the bright stars on a cold winter night was an experience of a lifetime!Thanks, Camelsafaries, and Mostapha and safe driving Hassan, for giving us such a wonderful experience! Would highly recommend this company for guided tours in Morocco."

It started off quite poorly admittedly as they were late (around 30 mins?) to pick us up from the airport in Fes. However, it was uphill from there, which is not something that can be said for most tours that we have been on. They were friendly, tried their best to explain things to us and ensured that my wife and I were well-taken care of.

            "review": "Mesmerising Maroc. This was the second time we hired the services of Mohammed from Camel Safaries. Just like last year, our trip fell nothing short of 5 star service from them. During our recent trip (25th Nov to 6th Dec), we had our expectations met and had many surprises throughout our time in magical Maroc. Our trip started from Asilah, a town on the northwest tip of the Atlantic coast of Morocco where we stayed at Riad Tabia, hosted by the very hospitable Adil and his wife, Juri. The next day, we took a day trip to Tanger where we visited Hercules Cave, one of the most popular tourist attractions which is set along the Atlantic ocean. Mohammed then introduced us to our down-to-earth guide, Mr Murad who, by the way is a fit and charming 71 year old man! We explored the bustling medina including the fish market where the friendly fishmongers were more than happy to have their photos taken. Subsequently, we proceeded to Midelt, a town in central Morocco, in the high plains between the Middle Atlas and High Atlas mountain ranges so you can imagine how cold it was then. The journey was about 5 to 6 hours drive but with a cool driver like Mohammed, you can expect a smooth and safe ride. We stopped by many scenic spots recommended by Mohammed where we took countless photos of the welcoming locals, beautiful scenery and cute flocks of sheep during our drives throughout our stay in Morocco. We also made a quick stop in Meknes before reaching the endless sand dunes in Merzouga, which was our second visit to this calm, terracotta plains. Mohammed also brought us to the busy market in Rissani, a small town nearby where you can shop for cheap souvenirs like scarves and local wares and be awed by the everyday scenes you will probably not experience back home. Dades was our next stop where you can expect many kasbahs peppered along both sides of the long and winding road. There are many small hotels or what they call auberge where you can spend the night and, they serve the most excellent dinners like the one we put up in called Hotel Babylon Dades. The staff there were awesome and they teamed up with Mohammed that night to put up an upbeat performance with their local drums. The next morning, Mohammed drove us up to the highest point in Dades where we saw the most stunning view of the picturesque valley. It would be unthinkable to stare down the steep terrains for long but I assure you it is worth the trip up there. On our way to Ourzazate, we stopped by Boutghrar Dades, a rough and rocky patch where we were greeted with excited children who were pleased with the sweets we brought them. Mohammed brought us to yet another delightful place called Kasbah Itrane for lunch where we enjoyed a breathtaking view of the surrounding greenery. In Ourzazate, we stayed at the comfortable Dar Chamma, which had a cosy courtyard for you to laze the afternoon away as you indulge in your favourite book. The next city, Taroudant was simply magnificent as the place we stayed at, Riad El Aissi, was one huge place with a sprawling yard for you to take many beautiful photos and enjoy the outdoors in the lush garden. Here, we managed to explore the medina where we came across the varied local stuff from fruits to clothing to jewellery before we found ourselves in Agadir the following day while we were on our way to Essaouria. Essaouria, also known as Wind City has a pristine beach ideal for surfers and beach-goers. You can get delectable seafood and many colourful trinkets for family and friends as the medina in this town is very easy to walk around in and I'm sure you won't mind getting lost there! After two days, we headed to Marrakech for the night where you should visit the energetic Jamaa el Fna in Marrakesh's medina quarter. We ended the memorable trip when Mohammed dropped us off at Casablanca. I would highly recommend Camel Safaries to anyone who would like to visit Morocco as they are reliable and more importantly that they try their best to suit your travel plans to ensure that you experience the best of Maroc."

The accommodations and pit stops were fantastic and the camel ride was exactly what we were looking for. We left just before sunset and so had incredible views during our ride which was the perfect length.

With plenty of intetesting stops and breaks along the way to keep us entertained always taking us to the more authentic than tourist location which was also the ethos for the whole trip.In the afternoon we arrived at the edge of the desert to a even better kasbah hotel to wash, have a drink, use the super good wifi and leave our bags overnight before embarking on our camels for the trek to our camp in the desert, also they sell beer and wine at the kasbah before you leave and bring it for you in a cool box to the dessert camp (nice touch) we got on our camels and were led across the dessert with plenty of photo oppertunites and also watched the sunset as well before we arrived to our camp for tea and dinner, drinks, music and good convosation! We choose to bring out matresses outside and sleep under the best view of the stars I have ever seen!Day 3: back on the camels to the kasbah for a lovely breakfast, shower etc to depart on the drive back to Merrakech, quite a drive to be honest but a nice touch on the way was stopping at a great little italian place becuase to be honest Ali knew we would be bored of tajines! they drove us to the hotel and yeah just have woken up to write him a review!I could highly recommened this tour so worth every penny they we great and you should book!Thanks to Ali, Hassan, Paul & Joy and Ki x"

I did the 2 day tour with my girlfriend, where we had our own Berber guide, Hassan, drive us through beautiful landscapes down to Zagora. It is a very full on day, but it goes quickly. When we finally arrived at the camels, it was a beautiful ride through the desert to the accommodation. Our camel guide, Ibrahim, is a total dude! Super friendly and welcoming as well as patient. I must recommend that when riding a camel, you should wear tight fitting trousers, and ask for more blankets if you are lacking a posterior..... It will rub (maybe even bring a pillow, I'm not kidding) Regardless of this, it was still awesome!! The accommodation in the desert is also brilliant. Our tent had proper beds and electricity, and they also provided soap and clean towels. The site had flushing toilets and showers, so it was much appreciated. The site can accommodate many many tourists, but there was only us two on this tour. They made us feel so welcome and we had such a laugh trying to learn Arabic and Berber. The highlight was all of us having a jam on their drums. I'm a drummer for a living, so it was an absolute joy!! Ali in the office is also very quick in responding to emails and it is run very efficiently. Highly recommended!! :-)"

Ali tailored to me and my five friends a tour to have an unforgettable memory the rest of our life about these beautiful Country. The hotels were spectacular with comfortable beds and extra facilities to enjoy more after long journeys as well as the restaurant and places who recommend in our way to taste the typical food from the different regions. I just can say, that I could not be happier after these days and I highly recommend to travel with camel safaries to everyone! Thank you so much Hassan and Ali for this awesome adventure!"

            "review": "Wonderful Experience with Mohammed Maazouz of Camel Safaries. My friends and I (a group of 5) visited Morocco for the first time in early September 2015. One of my friends booked the tour with Camel Safaries so I had zero expectations, but I was very surprised and satisfied with our tour with Camel Safaries and appreciated experiencing Morocco with an excellent private tour guide.OUR TOUR AND EXPERIENCEWe did the 4 days/3 nights tour from Marrakech through the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara Desert which was customizable according to our interests. Mohammed Maazouz served as both our driver and tour guide, who was exceptional (more on him later in my review). The varied landscape from Marrakech out towards the Sahara desert is extremely beautiful, and made all the better with Mohammed providing background to the landscape features and rural towns. The anti-Atlas mountain range on our drive back to Marrakech were incredibly breathtaking - flat land pocketed by low trees and shrubs juxtaposed with unique rock formations. The camel riding and camping in the desert is a nice experience, but the less \"touristy\" parts of the tour were the most memorable. We did experience a sand storm during our camel ride out to the desert camp, so come prepared with a buff or scarf to cover your face. One of the highlights of our tour was being invited to a day-before-the-wedding celebration lunch. Mohammed knew the family and it was such a fun experience to be \"one of the locals\" by eating a wonderful meal with a large gathering of friends and family members. We were clearly foreigners but were treated like one of the normal guests. My favorite part of our trip was interacting and spending some time with a nomad family. Mohammed seemed to know her and her young children personally and it was a very eye-opening experience learning how a typical nomad family lives. The meals were great - some were pretty touristy, but at the same time, those of us who had weaker stomachs appreciated those places. My favorite meal though, was eating at a local restaurant (packed and not a tourist in sight!) on our last day on the long drive back to Marrakech. I'm a vegetarian but ended up eating the beef meatballs and lamb chops to experience a true Moroccan meal. Other activities we did, that I'd recommend: visiting Mohammed's family's date tree stand in an oasis, walking around Ait Ben Haddou (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), and visiting the local market and eating fresh figs. I could have done without the visit to the Pigeons du Sable and the argan oil co-op visit, which I felt were tourist traps.OUR GUIDE, MOHAMMED MAAZOUZI don't think I can do Mohammed justice in this review. Mohammed has a way of making people feel very comfortable and welcomed. He has a calming personality and is very knowledgeable, as a tour guide should be. I don't know how Mohammed does it, but he drove for hours and hours in the company's Toyota Land Cruiser, and my group and I always felt safe. Despite the fact that he hosts a number of tours throughout the year, he really does treat your group like you're special. I never felt like simply a paycheck for him. Mohammed also seemed to care about our lives and interests and was patient in answering our seemingly endless questions about the Berber culture and people. I truly believe that having Mohammed as our tour guide really made our trip and cannot recommend him enough. LAST THOUGHTSIt ended up being a really great and memorable trip. The takeaway is that the tour can be completely tailored to your interests. You don't have to do anything you don't feel like doing. Mohammed always gave us options and asked us where we wanted to go next. I would recommend selecting the higher level accommodations/hotel stays so you are thoroughly comfortable on the trip. Also, make sure you have enough dirham before you leave the big city; there were only a few ATMs along the way in the rural towns and villages. Camel Safaries is a solid choice for a tour guide company and well priced. I believe having a guide, especially if it is your first visit to Morocco, is essential to not only experiencing but learning about and understanding the rich history, beautiful places, and the varied people of Morocco."

When I first found Ali online in 2006, when I led my first small group to Morocco, I had no idea what I would find when I met him and signed on for a tour. All these years later, I can say from my heart that Ali is simply the best--at every level. Guide, friend, and like family to me--Ali has gently guided my groups on 12 different 16- to 21-day trips through the country he knows so well. Intelligent, kind, knowledgable, and professional, Ali is the best guide imaginable. Although it is difficult for me to be objective after all this time, I can't imagine being in better hands than with Ali and his crew. Funny, unflappable, able to problem solve on the spot, he is able to offer custom designed trips and tours of any length or price point, Ali can create a perfect journey, a perfect way to experience the incredible culture and people of Morocco. I can't offer enough praise or assign enough stars to recommend this amazing young man and his company.As I said...my guide, my friend, my family."

My son and my sister and I booked this trip just knowing that we wanted to say that we had ridden camels in the Moroccan desert - not many people get that opportunity. What we weren't counting on were the awe inspiring vistas as we drove through the Atlas Mountains, the visions of the Berbers as they went along the streets with their happy faces, the beautiful (and not so beautiful) villages along the way. But most of all, the generosity and hospitality of our guide, Ali, during the Eid Al-Adha celebrations, who welcomed us into his home, giving us an experience we could never replicate. His professionalism and warmth at a time of great tragedy in his family is something that will stay with us forever. Thank you, Ali, and thank you Mohammed for delivering us safely back to Marrakech. If it wasn't for this tour, we may have had a very different opinion of Morocco (having only experienced the madness of Marrakech to that point), but now we can't recommend it highly enough."

Firstly, having a guide who is Morroccan is a huge advantage in getting to understand the country, the people and their culture. Secondly, Mohammed is incredibly pleasant to spend time with, always keen to answer and discuss any and all our questions (which we had plenty of), very informative and his English is excellent. We particularly appreciated his kind and generous invitation to share in his family's celebration of Aid-al-Adha, a once in a lifetime experience. In addition, the itinerary covered everything we wanted/needed to see, and suited us really well. The Land Rover was very comfortable. We'd highly recommend the Riad Madu tents in the desert.Thanks to Mohammed, we had an unforgettable experience in Morocco. Also, the payment process through GetYourGuide was seamless (another company asked for a Western Union transfer, which was more difficult)."

The camel ride was good fun, and when we were in the camp, we really had the impression of being in the middle of the desert, as it is well organised within the area of the dunes. It made us want to come back and enjoy a longer desert tour next time round."

In preparation for our trip to Morocco, I read countless reviews and asked for quotations from multiple tour companies for a 3 day/2 night camel tour from Fes-Marrakech. In the end, I am so pleased we chose Camel Safaries. The company was responsive via email and very clear as to what the itinerary would entail. What we didn't know is that we would be cared for by Mohammed, an intelligent, funny and very likeable guide who made the trip the highlight of our 2 weeks in Morocco. Sure, the overnight camel excursion was once-in-a lifetime, and sure the Gorges were breathtaking, and the apes were fun. But to see this part of the country in only 3 days requires very long days in the car- and with Mohammed it was more than just bearable, it was a rich experience. He was very knowledgable on everything Moroccan, and quickly figured out what we would find interesting. Happily, the 4x4 was comfortable, air conditioned and well- equipped. Each morning Mohammed ensured that the windows were so clean that I could take perfect pictures from inside the car! And our best times were stopping along the way in small towns to have a local meal with the locals, or sharing a 'Berber whiskey' with a nomad family. We can't say enough about the experience- thanks to the professionals at Camel Safaries."

Mohammed took us to lots of places, Casa, Marrakesh, the small village(Moulay Brahim) in Atlas mountains, Merzouga, Erg Chebbi, and then he drove us to Essaouira to attend the Gnawa Festival. Mohammed is not only a guide but also a friend, he took lots beautiful pics for us, and every place we drove to, he told lots of histories and stories about Morocco for us. Although sometimes drove more than 10 hours, but he always made us happy and enjoy every minute. He is a very devout Muslims, is so kind and friendly. He knew so much information about his country. We can feel his love to Morocco. He is so kind, sometimes we went through the poor village, he always stoped the car, and gave some sweets or fruits to the kids. He is so patient to every person. At last, I must to say, he is a very very good driver. Thank u so much, Mohammed, you made these days special! It is the best memories for us.

I think that says it all about this company and their guides-- they'll go out of the way to give you the very best experience of Morocco.I pride myself on being an independent traveler, and this is the first time I've ever used a tour guide to see a foreign country. I would recommend taking a tour with Camel Safaries no matter what! You see so much more than you would on your own and having a local guide with you who speaks the language and knows the customs opens up a whole new world of experiences.

From mint tea with local oasis farmers to real Moroccan BBQ and freshly-picked figs, Mohammed went above and beyond to introduce us to the best things Morocco has to offer. It was powerfully clear that Mohammed takes great pride in both his country and in showing it to the travelers of the world. Mohammed is also highly skilled. He speaks excellent English and, as a driver, is a paradigm of cool, calm, and collected. We felt very safe in his hands.Before our tour even ended, my girlfriend and I were talking of a return trip to Morocco in the future, and if we do so, it will certainly be with Camel Safaries."

Mohammed was an amazing guide. He was kind, helpful and friendly, but above all he was a absolute wealth of knowledge regarding all things to do with Morocco. His knowledge of the history of the country was outstanding and this combined with his geographical knowledge meant that we learnt so much in 3 days. My son even came away saying he had learnt more from Mohammed than he had learnt in the past year in history and geography lessons at school! Mohammed's ease at sharing his knowledge was also a real gift.As to his driving skills, we felt completely safe the whole time. We did experience one difficult situation, when because of an accident in a village that we were supposed to travel through, the only alternative was to cross a fast flowing river. Both Mohammed's judgement skills and his driving skills paid off here as after considering the options carefully, he drove us over the river with no difficulty.Camel Safaris had also arranged a super hotel at the edge of the desert for the first night of the tour.

But then you add how genuinely friendly he is, how patient with kids, how flexible, how prompt, his great driving (particularly on the crazy back roads of the Atlas Mountains), the relationships he's built up with locals, and how solicitous and helpful he is all the time without fail... well my goodness. Our tour with him was just superb. We had 4 nights and 5 days on the tour - started in Marrakech, then down to the desert, then a drop off in Fez. The amazing thing is that it all took place smack in the middle of Ramadan. I.e., the guy was up at 3:30 am for prayers, then no food or drink all day. I kept waiting for him to show some level of irritability brought on by physical discomfort, but he was unfailingly kind and helpful throughout. One of the things he told us was how right behavior, including how you perform at your job, is an important piece of being a good Muslim. Muhammed walks this talk.PS - one of our daughters forgot her Kindle in his car. They're shipping it back to us, no charge. This company is a class act."

My boyfriend and I were blown away with the incredible experience we were offered by Camel Safaris when we booked to travel with them from Marrakech to Fez over the course of three days in July 2015. Good friends had highly recommended that we travel through Morocco with this particular company as they had also had a unique and memorable experience back in 2012.We we treated with great care and professionalism right from the initial correspondence with Ali which was prompt and hugely informative as he guided us through the many and varied options available. It was clear that the itinerary could be flexible and was absolutely tailored to our spec of dates and interests. We even made a last minute amendment to the start date of our tour which Ali actioned with immediate effect and zero fuss. He was a true pleasure to book through as we felt more and more secure that this was indeed THE company to tour with. The A/C 4x4's are comfortable and spacious and felt like our own space for three days.... and then we met Mohammed - the wonderful, personable, conscientious driver who would be hosting our tour which further fueled our excitement to get going. Ali had arranged for Mohammed to visit us at our Riad a couple of nights before beginning our tour to answer any questions and tell us a little more about his proposed itinerary.Once again, from initial meeting to the big hugs at the end of the trip, Mohammed was kind, consistently careful on the roads, informative and overall incredibly personable, genuinely ensuring that we had a hugely special experience. Our highlight was camel trekking to spend a night out in the desert, and watching the sun rise over the Sahara the following morning which was unforgettable.I work within the service industry, and recognise the importance of both positive feedback and constructive criticism, however I quite honestly could not fault Camel Safaris in any single way. Mohammed is a gem, as I'm sure the rest of Ali's team are, and I would 100% recommend Camel Safaris to any other lucky travellers who have the opportunity to explore Morocco. Ultimate care and comfort is what they offer - you will not be disappointed!"

We brought my Mom, my sister, and my Mom's best friend and my wife's cousin (also Moroccan) along for the trip. We all had a blast! The trip showcased some of the most beautiful places in Morocco. It never felt \"touristy\". My wife and cousin loved it, too - they saw parts of Morocco they'd never been to and said it was a fantastic experience. Mohammed Maazouz was our guide - and he was fantastic. His English and manners are impeccable. The hotels included in the package were very very nice (it can be hard to find great hotels in Morocco). One of my favorite memories of the trip was Mohammed entertaining us with a traditional story during one of the drives between locations.This is by far the best way to see Morocco. I highly recommend the experience."

Our guide Mohammed was extremely knowledgeable, upbeat, and competent; he answered every question we could think of, kept us entertained, and educated us about his country. We drove around to many small towns and interesting stopping points and consequently were able to see so much more of the country than just the bigger cities. All of the accommodation, food, etc. was absolutely on-point and I had absolutely no complaints there. The camel trek out into the desert was such a cool experience, and we were completely taken care of the entire trip. I would highly recommend this tour company."

He answered all of our questions about any thing. So informed on Moroccos history and obviously its culture. He spoke brilliant english, constantly made sure we were comfortable and well hydrated. The drive is long but the stops along the way are breath taking. Driving to the peak of the high Atlas Mountains (second tallest mountain peak in Africa!) was a once in a life time experience. When we stopped for lunch were also able to tour at a beautiful Kasbah in which many movies and tv shows were filmed. We arrived late to our camels but the guides there were very accommodating. Our camel guide was excellent and even shared some of his fruit and local foods when we stopped briefly for a desert picnic so he could break his fast. The camp site was well maintained, safe, and comfortable. Our meals were very nice and following dinner we had a great time playing music and hanging out with the guides and other visitors on different camel treks (ours was the best). Mohammed was available for any thing we needed the entire time, even in the evenings at the camp site, he was honest and thoughtful and the entire adventure was well organized. We were sad to say goodbye but it was a two day experience that will stay with us for a life time."

            "review": "Amazing adventures with Camel Safaries!. As two young American women traveling alone in a foreign country, we were a bit worried about choosing the right tour guides for our time in the desert of Morocco. Lucky for us, we chose wisely... and had the most incredible time!!! Everything was well organized and laid back. Our guides, Anass and Ali, showed us an amazing time. From our pick up in Marrakech, through the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara desert, and then on to Fes. Of our ten days in Morocco, the 4 days we spent with Camel Safaries stand out above the rest of the trip. 100%.We booked a 2 night, 3 day tour (with only one night in the desert). After the first day, we knew we had to extend it! Camel Safaries was super flexible in letting us add on an extra day with no problem... and we were SO glad we did. We spent an extra day with them and our 4x4 driver, Mohammed, who was so much fun!!! By the end of day 2 & 3, we felt like we were exploring the desert with old friends, truly. Our guide Ali, took us to his family's house to have lunch on the way to the desert, which was an unexpected surprise. They were so wonderful about answering our MANY questions about their culture, religion, and way of life in Morocco. The night spent in the desert was wonderful- but I will say we didn't have the best circumstances. It was a full moon, so it was difficult to see many stars (be sure to plan your night in the desert around the moon!). Otherwise, it was wonderful. On our 4x4 day with Mohammed, he drove us to what seemed like the middle of nowhere in the Sahara and we stopped for a game of volleyball, while camels watched us in the distance. We then found the only tree around, where they made us a picnic lunch and impromptu fire (despite the heat of the sun!). Another one of our favorite moments.They also connected us with a nomad family in the Sahara desert, who we spent an afternoon with. Their way of life was fascinating! So fascinating, that we decided to come back later for dinner with them (after they kindly invited us). That dinner was one of the most memorable travel experiences I've ever had. Mohammed drove us through the desert back to their nomad hut, and we brought them the food supplies to cook dinner. We then went to have something to drink and watch the sunset in the desert with the guides while we waited for them to cook our dinner. That time was very special. Once we returned to the nomad's house it was dark... the only light being the full moon. Mohammed brought candles that we placed around the room we would eat in- which made the entire meal feel like a family holiday. We ate by candlelight with the nomads and had the most unique and wonderful experience with them. They even invited us to spend the night in their hut, but we sadly had to leave early the next morning for Fes. I really cannot say enough great things about Camel Safaries. We were so lucky to have found them... and have continued to be in touch, as they became our friends. If you're looking for a unique experience with wonderful guides... these are your guys!"

Throughout the whole trip, he was extremely willing to share his knowledge on Morocco. Anas went the extra mile in ensuring that we had a great time.

As well, we really wanted sandwiches during lunch and Anas made that possible for us. Though Anas was fasting, he was still flawless in his work.

Over 12 days we worked with Mohammed, Ali (Africa!) and Hassan - along with top notch local guides.

Ali and Hassan picked us up and started the tour. They were energetic, fun and quite knowledgeable. Not too many tourists have chicken rotisserie in Menkes with the locales - they brought n authentic twist to an \"organized tour.\" In Fez we were picked up by Mohammed. Off to his hometown in the desert. In addition to our camel trip to the luxury tent camp, we had lunch (homemade) with his family. Our best lunch of the trip. He was very accommodating- along the way their was Fantasia in a local town and he was willing to pull over spontaneously so we could see it. At the end in Marrakech, our room was unbelievable and so romantic. Great way to celebrate my birthday. We left feeling we have a friendship with Mohammed - he truly cared and aimed to keep us happy.

Muhammad was very kind and accommodating as he tried his utmost best to cater to our needs and requests. There was never a dull moment throughout our trip as he patiently brought us from one city to another, letting us have a taste of Moroccan life and its rich culture as we met the friendly locals and even a family in the Merzouga desert. We were captivated by the countless beautiful sights during our long drives from one city to another and were always awed by the stories Muhammad shared about magnificent Morocco. We got to see breathtaking landscapes, scenic deserts, the ever-so-cool Atlas Mountains, colourful medinas with the endless arrays of things we never knew existed, the charming Todra Gorge and lots more that you've got to see for yourself.

A quick note: we are frequent international travelers who have never gone on an organized tour before. When we travel, we usually do a bunch of research, rent a car, and go at it on our own. After reading the reviews of Camel Safaris (and not speaking a word of Berber or Arabic, and only a few words of French), booking a tour seemed prudent, and I'm so glad we did!Ali helped arrange everything ahead of time, and his emails were always very prompt and friendly. Mohammed picked us up in Fes, and we liked him from the start. He's super smart, polite, charming, and obviously loves his country. We had such a great time talking to him about the customs, religion, food, politics, favorite soccer teams, etc. The tour itself was fantastic, too - we fed monkeys in a cedar forest, rode camels into the desert and spent the night in a Berber tent, toured an underground well, visited an ancient kasbah, drove through the most beautiful gorges and oases, and ate the best food in roadside cafes with not a tourist in sight. The hotel where we stayed in Ouarzazete was gorgeous, and the desert hotel where we cleaned up after the desert camping was great, too (we had booked the mid-level accommodation level and were blown away that both weren't considered 'luxury'). The whole trip really avoided anything overtly touristy-feeling (camel-riding is inherently touristy, but it was *awesome* and a bucket-list thing for us). I kept thinking how happy I was that we'd chosen this tour to really get a feel of the countryside (and make a new Moroccan friend in Mohammed). Had we just visited the big cities on our trip to Morocco, it would have completely transformed the vacation. We never would have learned so much about the culture and experienced the country's rural beauty without Camel Safaris; skipping the tour would have been a huge mistake! I highly recommend this company and the experience it provides."

Many roads were broken and impassable. We had to reschedule and change our itinerary, often at the last minute. Ali and his team were fully accommodating, sending us information and suggesting alternatives, all with our safety in mind. My email chain with Ali reached almost 40 long messages back-&-forth. In the end, by delaying our trip by 4 days so that the roads could be repaired, and doing our trip in reverse (Fes -> Sahara -> Marrakesh), we had a successful trip.Youssef (pronounced yu-su) was our guide. He was an excellent driver, especially given that many of the roads we traversed were covered in pot-holes, partially washed away, or even covered by a surging river (we had to wait for the water to subside for that one.) We never felt unsafe with Youssef at the wheels.Seeing the Sahara sunrise is bucket-list worthy, and is now one of my favorite things ever. Sandboarding down the dunes and riding the camels were also super fun. If you visit Morocco, don't hesitate about making the long trip to the Sahara, and if you do, Camel Safaries is a terrific choice."

            "review": "'wow- What a Trip!'. We travelled to Morocco with our 2 teenage boys to have a bit of an adventure. We had 11 days to fit in an awful lot and travel a long way! Having read the reviews for Camel Safaries we decided to see if Ali could come up with an Itinerary to suit our needs in the time frame allowed. Not only did he come up with everything we asked for but the price was affordable and included everything except our drinks and lunches. We had a Toyota 4x4 driven by Ibrahim our very happy (and safe) driver and Mustapha our guide who was the font of all knowledge (answering our thousands of questions ),who was very courteous, amenable and spoke great English. They both had a great sense of humour which suited our family down to the ground! We stayed in a variety of beautiful old Riads along the way,all slightly different but lovely and the food was always great.We did a camel ride and an overnight stay in Berber tents in the desert..that night we had the best Tagine of the whole trip followed by a drum party and the boys had a go on sandboards down the dunes as the sun went down..what a great night! The guys hired brand new quad bikes the next day and had the time of their lives riding through the dunes and back to our Riad for a candlelit supper under the trees!We saw the most spectacular scenery on our 3 day journey to the coast which was continually changing and quite breathtaking. We stopped whenever we liked to stretch our legs and take photos and always had a nice lunch somewhere en route. Our final few days were spent in Essaouira, surfing,paddleboarding, relaxing and horseriding. Ali sought out a lovely quiet surf beach not too far away as a suggested option and made sure we could hire boards there, the waves were massive and we had a fantastic time. As we had 3 nights in the same hotel Ali had arranged that we only ate at the hotel for one and got to go and experience other fantastic restaurants that served seafood on the other 2 nights..that was brilliant and so thoughtful. Having Mustapha with us gave us the chance to go to places and see things we would't have done had we driven ourselves and we learnt so much about life in Morocco from him. We really got a taste of the local culture,which is just what we had wanted and all learnt to say a few things in Arabic/Berber which the locals seemed to enjoy.. We all give Ali and his team a massive thumbs up and thank you for making our trip everything we hoped for and more."

            "review": "Good Experience. We did the five days/four nights from Marrakesh to Fez with our three children ages 11-16. Everything was very well organized and Hassan our guide was very friendly and upbeat with the kids. We especially liked meeting his friend in his home town who gave us a tour of the market and played a bit of soccer with our girls. The camel trek and staying in the Berber tent exceeded our expectations.This is a pretty straightforward tour so expect to see other tours following the same path as you. The exception is one day where you do go off the beaten path to see the Berbers in the caves which was very interesting and a lot of driving that day, but getting off the beaten path frequently is. The mid range places were nicer than I expected, but also larger (less intimate) than I expected. There is a lot of ground to cover in a short amount of time so there is a lot of driving almost every day (4.5-7hrs a day) which limited our spontaneous exploring. If you can take longer and break it up more, I highly suggest it. The breakfasts and dinners were all very good. Lunch options were limited bc it was Ramadan, but instead of hot sit down lunches of tagine and kebobs at usually more than 10USD per person, picking up fresh foods like bread, cheese, and tomotoes from local markets would have been preferable, but less available bc of the timing. Overall, this is a solid choice, well organized and well priced."

Our guide and driver Mohammed picked us up in a new 4x4 which was perfect for driving through the Atlas Mountains. He is experienced and we felt very comfortable with his driving. He was also very knowledgable about pretty much everything and always kept us entertained with stories and facts about what we were seeing.The overnight stay in the dessert was far more luxurious than I had expected. There are showers, running water and the tents even have beds and furniture. The only downside is that we found the dishes a bit dirty. All in all I highly reccommend them because we felt very well taken after and enjoyed every minute of the tour."

We couldn't say better things about our guide and driver Youssef who was kind, friendly and knowledgeable (and a very safe driver!). It was also great to have a guide from the Erg Chebbi/Merzouga region who knew the area very well. We stayed at great hotels for the duration of our trip and Ali was very accommodating during our trip planning and to last minute itinerary changes we wanted to make (while we were already on day 2 of our trip). We were never rushed and had the flexibility to visit anything we were interested in (or skip anything we weren't). The price that Ali quoted us from the beginning was reasonable and while on arrival guides were eager to offer us a lower price, we found comfort in paying a little extra for safety, reliability and comfort throughout our trip. (Others we met who traveled with other companies/guides varied greatly when it came to their experiences and satisfaction with their trips and accommodations) I would absolutely recommend camel safaries (and our guide Yousef!) to anyone visiting Morocco. PS I would recommend a 4 day vs. a 3 night trip as you will be doing a lot of driving and having the day to rest in Merzouga prior to our overnight desert camping was a wonderful break!"

We appreciated the promptness and flexibility that Ali and the company showed to helping us design our itinerary. Our primary guide and driver was Ibrahim. He was a careful and SAFE driver, had a great sense of humor, was supportive of our photography focus, and like Ali in the head office, he was flexible and worked hard to get us to the places that we wanted to go. He was a fount of information about the desert and about the customs of Berber people. We loved hearing his stories about his family's partial transition from desert nomadism to settled town life, and were amazed at his musical talents as well. We also arranged a transfer from Marrakech to Casablanca Airport with a stop at the Hassan II mosque. Our driver on that day was Ali (not the same as Ali the owner), and he was also very friendly, and we really enjoyed learning from him about the history of Morocco and the Berber people. Our impression is that Camel Safaris is a great company that it is continuing to improve. Director Ali checked in with his drivers every day, and both he and the drivers sincerely asked us for feedback/constructive criticism. We do not know if we will return to Morocco in the near future, but if we do we will gladly work with Camel Safaris again!Will Betz and Debbie Williamson"

In each large city Ali had a local expert give us a 1/2 day tour and it was great getting facts and hearing stories from those who have lived in those cities. After visits to Todas Gorge, Ouarzazate, Essaouira and back to Marrakech, every day was full of activity but with plenty of wonderful stops for tea.

I would recommend taking the three or four day tour if you do this trip because from what I was told, the large dunes are majestic.

After a few months of trip planning and research, we decided to hire a local touring company for the section of Atlas and central Morocco. I contacted Camel&Safaries based on the good reviews at the TripAdvisor for their quality services provided. Ali patiently worked with me to customize the itinerary to fulfill my wish list. He was very responsive to all my questions. We booked a 4 day 3 night Atlas, central Morocco, desert and Volubilis tour, started from Marrakech and ended at Meknes. Camel&Safaries provided a nine seat Mercedi-Benz van, a driver (Anazis) and a tour guid (Mohammed) With all the luggages, we could still seated comfortably in the car for 4 days. Both the guide and driver were very knowledgeable and informative. They not only answered all our questions, but also enlightened us with their living cultures by their personal/family stories. We had many laughs and shared stories of cultural differences. It was like a family vacation. At the end of the tour and before dropping us at our hotel in Meknes, Mohammed had gone out of his way to arrange a private car for us taking us to Fez the next day afternoon. It was a comfortable ride at a reasonable price. In a summary, the quality of the inclusive services, accommodations and meals in this tour was beyond our expectations. We had a wonderful time in Morocco; the tour with Camel&Safaries was one of the major tributes to this memorable experience. The lunches were not included in the tour package. The restaurants Mohammed took us for lunches were very touristy; especially the one in Meknes was pricy and not good. Camel&Safaries may check out other restaurants for better selections."

Mohammed was always willing and able to answer any questions and to make suggestions.We stayed at the Kabash Chez Pierre the first night where we had a lovely room and the best dinner of our trip. It was fantastic!Our second night we enjoyed in the desert. Unfortunately it was overcast, it actually rained (!), so we did not get either a great sunset or sunrise or a great view of the stars. However, we had a good time with the other 9 guests telling stories and listening to the Berber music provided by our hosts. Tents were comfortable. We had a hotel room back at the base where we started from and were able to leave most of our belongings there.Mohammed arranged for Berber pizza the next day which my husband has said was the best food he had. We saw so much that it is impossible to go into detail. I would trust Mohammed and his Uncle who owns the company to look into and help with any arrangements you want. At our request Mohammed also made arrangements for a guides in the Medina for both Marrekesh and Fes. Which we highly recommend.We likely won't be back in Morocco soon - as there are other places we want to see - but if I was going I would definitely book through Camel Safaries."

Ali is well-educated and speaks many languages, but what is special about him is his love of his culture, which comes through as he explains the history and dynamics of Morocco and Moroccan life. Plus, he is just a delightful person in every way. His own appreciation of his culture is contagious, plus he is well-organized and professional. His drivers are also excellent--always helpful, courteous, and careful on the road. Ali can put together whatever kind of trip you would like, for whatever budget you have. If I could give him ten stars, I would!"

It was an amazing experience and highly recommended. Our guide and driver were amazing and became good friends by the end. Mohammed knew the answer to every question we threw at him and always gave more details about anything you wanted. Ali organized everything for us and even accommodated our special request to end the tour in a different city. We did the budget accommodation and it was fantastic. The tour was beyond what we were expecting and I can't recommend it highly enough. It was an amazing way to see all the different aspects of Morocco when we were just travelling there for a short time."

Ali from Camel Safaries arranged everything, from transportation to accommodation to activities and planned everything according to our tastes. He even went above and beyond and took us to see his family and house as well as stayed up late with us to stargaze on the sahara desert sands. One of our travelers was vegetarian and Ali was very helpful in finding us restaurants we could all enjoy. Through him, we also befriended several locals who I still keep in touch with and whom gave us a local's perspective on life in Morocco. In a country where you might expect some hiccups during travel, this trip was completely worry-free and went so smoothly because Ali and our driver, Youssef, handled everything. The people at Camel Safaries are not just professionals at what they do, but they are good people. By the end of our trip, we all become good friends. We enjoyed a one-of-a-kind experience and I will always have fond memories of Morocco thanks to Camel Safaries."

When I found out you could ride a camel in the Sahara Desert, I knew that we had to book a trek. We didn't know that this trek would include so much more beside the camel and the desert! We got to see the beauty of Morocco that you can't see by just staying in the big cities. Mohammed was an outstanding guide and was extremely knowledgeable in all aspects of Morocco. You could ask him anything and he had the answer!! I highly recommend Camel Safaries, you will not regret it!!"

            "review": "Great experience with Camel Safaries!. An overdue review. Back in Sept 2011, we took a custom 5 day trip to Morocco. Ali was our primary contact in arranging the custom tour and was always helpful and responsive along the way.Our driver for the entire trip was Brahim. Picked us up upon arrival in Casablanca and headed straight towards Fez with a stop in Meknes. We met a local guide in Meknes for a 2 hour tour of town, then into Fez. We spent 1.5 days in Fez (with a terrific female local guide -- since we were 2 girls travelling, it was fascinating to ask her about life in Morocco). We also enjoyed our stop at a ceramics factory in Fez (may have been a bit touristy, but the ceramics were beautiful and nicer quality than ones we found elsewhere). We then continued on to Marrakesh for 3 days, meeting a local guide there as well. We took a one day excursion to Essaouira for a change of scenery and it was nice to escape the heat and chaos Marrakesh. Flew out of Marrakesh. Camel safaries provided all transportation and transfers. The restaurants they took us to were good (perhaps not outstanding), but the last night in Marrakesh we really enjoyed dinner at a more modern, less touristy restaurant outside of the kasbah walls -- near the post office downtown. It was a nicer place with modern takes on Moroccan flavors. Unfortunately I can't remember the name... but you should ask your driver for alternative options with dining when you start to get tired of the same old tagines and pastillas and cous cous, which we ate for the first 4 days of the trip.We stayed in great riads (see my other reviews) booked through Camel Safaries.Overall, Camel Safaries was great. They required only a deposit upon booking (via Western Union) and we paid the balance in cash in person at the conclusion of our tour (so be prepared to carry a lot of cash throughout the tour).The only downside -- we were focused on meeting Brahim at the Casablanca airport upon arrival and neglected to get local currency from the ATM right away, thinking it would be easy to stop at an ATM along the way. Brahim was concerned about us using a rural ATM on a Sunday in case there were issues with the transaction, so we didn't end up getting cash until day 3 of the trip. In the meantime, he was our personal currency exchange. This wasn't Camel Safaries' problem so much as a suggestion for other travellers to go ahead and get local currency from the ATM at the airport!"

Since we got in the car we started learning everything about Morocco, the Berbers and all the culture, Ibrahim was so informative and knowledgable. He wanted to please us in everything and made us feel as if we were his sisters. The camel ride was amazing, such an experience! And when we arrived at the bivouac we were astonished of how it was! It exceeded our expectations. The Berbers on camp were so nice, the food excellent and the accommodations more of what we could have wished for! It's totally an experience everyone has to live!

Can't speak highly enough about our experience. We saw so many things that we never would have seen if we hadn't done the trek, and everything was laid out for us. We had our own 4x4, our own driver (Hassan), and an English-speaking guide the whole way, and they really knew what they were doing, timing out every portion of the trip, hitting all of the locations that we never would have realized to go to, and even enjoying many of the sights with us, which was a huge help (especially when visiting the markets).This was a far superior way to travel relative to renting our own car, and our night camel-trekking in the desert was one of the most memorable experiences we'll ever have. I also wanted to add a note to recommend our guide, Mohamed Mazouz, who was incredible. He was incredibly engaging throughout the trip, and made my wife and I feel like family. I suggest requesting him, you won't be disappointed!Overall, I highly recommend Camel Safaries for anybody who wants to see some of Morocco outside of the main cities. It is extremely affordable, incredibly professional, and an experience that you can't get on your own."

Our initial research proved most companies in Morocco follow a similar route so we based our decision to go with Camel Safaries on their friendliness and communication through many email exchanges. Ali, the company owner, was exceptional with answering our numerous questions, responding to emails in a timely manner, and providing us with enough information to feel comfortable and excited for our adventure. Our tour was scheduled with Mohammed and Hamid; they were/are a great team. Each of them have their roles, Hamid, the driver was excellent. Never once did I feel unsafe or uncomfortable being a passenger in the car. Mohammed, the guide, is incredibly knowledgeable and thorough in his understanding and explanations about the various sites along the tour. His expertise is not only tour specific but any questions or curiosities asked throughout the journey Mohammed knew the answer. He is so very kind and always a gentleman. Hamid and Mohammed never rushed us and even allowed us to deviate from the scheduled sites to take in other experiences we saw along the way (a local village street market). The team\u2019s kindness never stopped even after our tour ended. We made new friends in Morocco.

It was a beautiful drive into the desert, stopping along a few towns to explore and eat. The drive deeper into the desert was very hot. At one point we pulled over to chase a huge yellow lizard. It was quite fun. Once we arrived we each got into a camel and Ali put us into the care of a guide who took us into the desert sand dunes to a camp site which was already set up. There we settled in. We played music with our guide, drank wine, and the guide made us an amazing Tagine in the desert sand. The best I've had! We all decided to sleep side by side outside under the stars because the tents felt very dark. At some point in the middle of the night we saw comets and shooting starts.... We watched the sun come up and then we prepared to explore a bit before returning to meet Ali. It was amazing! I did however think, if our guide happens to drop dead, how would we leave this place??? I guess Ai would have come for us. :) It was one of the best experiences ever.... And Ali is great. Very informative, fun and accommodating."

My husband and I met Ali in Marrakesh which was a fabulous city. He showed us around, but gave us ample time to explore on our own. I don't usually take tours since I like to stumble upon things myself, but Ali provided the right mix of guidance and independence. His English is impeccable and he answered such candid questions of ours. We really got a good feel for the culture. We did a lot of driving through the Atlas Mountains to Fez, the Sahara Desert and then to Casablanca. Yosef was an excellent driver and also entertaining. We were never at a loss for words and laughed a lot. He also sang for us and answered lots of our questions. My favorite part was the camel ride in the desert and then sleeping overnight in a tent. It was just an amazing experience and so beautiful. I can't recommend them enough. It's a trip I will never forget!"

My partner Tracy and I met Ali from Camel Safaris in Marrakesh on the recommendation of a Canadian couple we had met in 2009.We both immediately liked and felt comfortable with Ali and signed up for a 5 days trip commencing the next morning.We thoroughly enjoyed the experience, being one of the highlights of a 6 mth vacation through North Africa and Europe.Ali and Yusuf ( his calm and deliberate driver) made the 5 days navigating some difficult terrain and cultural differences a breeze. There was never any moments where we felt 'obligated' to buy from a local vendor ( as had happened previously on tours) and Tracy was treated with the utmost respect and courtesy.Ali has designed his Tours extremely well. Each day is fascinating, with appropriate breaks for meals factored into the schedule. The drive from Marrakesh into the Sahara was breathtaking, my DSLR was working overtime, and meeting the woman who lives in a cave with her family was also a highlight.We are still in contact with Ali, in fact on our return to Australia a glass of Saharan sand was accidently thrown out and upon emailing Ali he sent me another bag of sand!! Now that's service.We can't recommend Camel Safaris highly enough."

            "review": "Fantastic experience with Camel Safaries. Back in 2007, we took a phenomenal 10-day tour of Morocco. We found Ali Oussou through a posting on TripAdvisor, and he subsequently sent me half-a-dozen references, one in my own hometown whom I met for coffee. After speak to Ali by email and phone and then meeting his reference in person, I felt quite comfortable booking him for our trip. He helped me plan our itinerary and booked hotels for us. Our itinerary was: Marrakesh - Ouarzazate - Tinghir - Merzouga - Midelt - Fez - Rabat - Casablanca.Ali picked us up from the airport with his driver Youssef and a 4x4 Toyota Land Cruiser. He stayed with us the whole time as we sped across southern Morocco, stopping in tiny Berber villages along the way. He also arranged a 2-day camel trek into the desert, along with sandboarding - one of the most amazing experiences we have ever had.Ali speaks Berber, Classical Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, French, English and Spanish, and has a degree in Linguistics from the University of Meknes. He was a knowledgeable, friendly and very competent guide.We became good friends with both Ali and Youssef. If we ever took a local guide in one of the big cities (local guides are required by law in each city), Ali personally introduced us to him in advance. Youssef himself owns the Toyota and always made sure it was clean, functioning and safely guarded.Ali even arranged a cell phone for us, and texted us while we were with local guides to make sure everything was OK.Due to Ali's knowledge and hard work, we felt like guests in Morocco, not tourists. He introduced us to numerous locals in a way that you are never able to in groups. We had tea with a Berber woman who lives in a cave and has 11 children. As Ali put it, She has very little money but a very big heart.This trip really put into perspective the diversity of life in our world, and we returned to Morocco amazed in every way; by the rich culture, geography, language, cuisine, and hospitality. We could never have had such an amazing experience had we not had the good fortune of finding Ali Oussou."

They were fun to chat with, always telling stories, and jokes and background information about various places.They also knew when to give us our own quiet time or alone time, which was great. They put together a customized itinerary for us for eight days, which includes some big cities (Fez, Marrakesh, Casablanca), smaller cities (Ouarzazate, etc.), the desert, and the Atlas mountains.One highlight was a visit with a local cave-dwelling family they know, where we got to hang out and see how they live.Fantastic guidance, great people, reasonable rates, will gladly use again."

Our group are not the sort of people who would generally choose to go on a guided tour of a country and have found our way around countries by ourselves previously. We hummed and harred about whether to go with a guide. My wife convinced us to go with Ali and Yousif as her mother had travelled with them before and had raved about it.We did not regret the decision at all.We would have missed so much if we had not travelled with Ali. His knowledge of the local areas was amazing and we went off the beaten path to see things that we would have drifted past if we had travelled solo.Some of the hotels were a bit of an adventure and they certainly added to the experience. The vehicle was comfortable and we stopped to take in the scenery and meet the locals, cats and camels along the way.Ali proved to be quite the entertainer and gave us a display of his drumming at a restaurant we stopped at along the way. The proprietors all seemed to know and like Ali and Yousif and were always happy to see him and share some jokes with him. We would not have been so well received if we had not been with them I'm sure. Our tour was the middle section of a two week holiday and was easily the highlight of the fortnight. We started in Marakech and were dropped off in Essaouira.It surprised us that Ali received messages and calls from previous travellers on our trip, but since leaving Morocco we have kept in touch and are promising ourselves that we will return and catch up with the eternally youthful Ali in person.If you can't decide whether to travel with Camel Safaries, stop thinking about it and just do it. The only reservations you should have fpr one of these tours should be in the charismatic hotels along the way."

Months before the trip, we corresponded via emails and Ali was always prompt with his replies. I had a thousand questions and Ali was never short of answers. He picked us up from the airport and travelled with us throughout. What I liked about him the most was his positive attitude - anything you ask, he'd say \"It's possible\" - and he'd make it possible also. When my husband fell sick because of the heat in Merzouga, he arranged to keep the room for one whole day without any extra charge, so that my husband could sleep in through the day. The Riads we stayed in were breathtaking, the car that travelled with us was top notch, the places we visited were magical. We are absolute foodies and Ali made sure we ate at the local places and the Tagines and Tanginas we've had there were far more delicious than the ones at renowned but touristic restaurants.Ali is polite, friendly, enthusiastic, honest, flexible and it's very apparent that he takes pride in showing off his country to foreigners. Our driver was Hamid and he is such a sweet guy - a bit shy, but extremely funny. We are usually independent travellers, but decided to go through a pre-arranged tour of Morocco because of shortage of time and the distance we had to travel and I don't regret that I did it. The car was at our disposal and the distances, though very long sometimes, with enough stops in between, through breath taking landscapes, was worth it. I shopped around quite a bit before booking the tour through Camel Safaries and the reviews that I got on TripAdvisor and other travel forums about Camel Safaries was bang on and it was relatively cheaper too, than some of the quotes I got from other recommended guides and travel companies.I would absolutely recommend Ali and Camel Safaries to anyone planning a trip to Morocco. Thanks Ali. You made it a very memorable holiday."

Although I traveled by myself, I was accompanied by a guide and a driver. The duration of my trip fell on the period of Ramadan this year and my driver and my guide traveling with me under scorching sun for hours without water and food. However, they never complained and in fact, they were usually the one who tried to keep me awake by talking to me(I usually was tired out from the heat) and telling me stories of Morocco. They definitely show me the famous hospitality of Moroccans as they invited me to break the fast with them most nights and they became like my family members by the end of the trip. In the span of 2 weeks, I got to see Morocco's diverse landscapes, beautiful architecture, amazing artwork and mostly, the hospitality and warmth of Moroccans. People were so wonderful and were not hesitating to open up their doors and their hearts to me. When I left, I was being told that I have 2 new families in Morocco now and I will always be welcomed back. It was definitely an amazing trip and a great eye-opener, I will never forget about it and look forward to my future visit. Thank to Camel Safaries and a great thanks to Mohammed, Hamid, Brian and Ali for their wonderful work. You truly represent the essence of Morocco."

At all times we felt completely safe with our driver even though we travelled many windy narrow scenic roads and tracks.We thoroughly enjoyed the busy medinas of Fez, Meknes and of course Marrakesh (the night scene is something we will never forget). Also enjoyed greatly the picturesque, small hilltop village of Chefchaouen (don\u2019t miss it) and the seaside Essouria (great for relaxation) and mountain stay in the Atlas mountains. Also don\u2019t miss the ruins of Volubulis and these stunning mosaics. All this was in great contrast to the wonderfully scenic mountainous gorges and our unique desert camel experience.  All in all wonderful variety in our 2 weeks was experienced. As others have said our expectations were well and truly met and we have no hesitation in giving Ali and his company the highest recommendation."

            "review": "Morocco at it's best. In January I went on a 2 week holiday in Morocco with my partner, part of which included a 3-day tour with Camel Safaries. The tour we arranged involved departing from Marrakech and going through the High Atlas mountains, stopping by many sights in south-eastern Morocco, the first night in Dades Gorge and day 2 camping out in the desert in a berber tent, and the last day driving through the Middle Atlas mountains onto F\u00e9s. This was by far the best part of my holiday, especially the night in the desert.Ali really took care of us and did all he could to give us the best tour he could give. You could really see this was something he loved to do. Despite the long distance from Marrakech to the desert and then to F\u00e9s, we stopped to see so many things that it didn't feel like a long car ride. Ali talked the whole way tirelessly explaining every little detail, I felt bad at times when I would nod off because he was making so much of an effort and I really appreciated it as opposed to someone just driving you. The things we saw were amazing too. The snow covered High Atlas and Middle Atlas mountains, monkeys in the cedar forest, several Casbahs (the best being A\u00eft Benhaddou) and Oases, and some impressive valleys like Todra Gorge. We couldn't have seen these places in the amount of time on our own, nor would we have dared driving through those scary roads at the High Atlas mountains. When we got to the desert, I couldn't believe my eyes. It looked like a painting! I took a bottle full of sand from the Sahara as a souvenir just to show friends how red the sand is. The night out was also quite amazing. Despite the cold weather I got a rug out next to the fire and lay down with 2 thick blankets on top of me and just stared at the stars for ages. Its just amazing how lit up the sky is when there are no lights. The tents themselves are very traditional except for the beds inside, but i appreciated this since i already lay on the sand next to fire and couldn't imagine doing that for the night. If anyone is ever considering a trip to Morocco don't just hang out in the big cities like Marrakesh or F\u00e9s, make the effort to see the desert it really is worth it! Weeks before this trip when I was in Thailand for xmas, I remember talking to some norwegian tourists in my hotel who told me how unremarkable their desert tour was and how uncomfortable the camel ride was but I have to say the camel ride did not feel uncomfortable at all. It was very well cushioned and I was on such a high during the 2 hr camel ride that by the time it ended i was like .. oh are we there already??6 months on I still remember Morocco and how great it was there. Thanks Ali for an unforgettable 3 days."

We returned recently from 10 day tour covering the northern part of Morocco (Asilah [coast], Chefchaouen, Fes, Meknes, Volubilis) and mid-region areas Marrakech, Essaouira (coast), and Imlil. Consistency is the key\u2026.once again, Camel Safaries, exceeded our expectations. Our guide was just as detailed oriented, knowledgeable, and professional as our other tours. The vehicle was clearly well maintained and we felt at ease and safe with the driver especially on those winding roads! Camel Safaries employs experienced, local individuals that speak English very well and truly are passionate about their country and their jobs. Each was very personable which was so appreciated as we do enjoy conversations learning about the culture and intricacies of local life. It\u2019s amazing how many lovely areas there are in Morocco. Asilah was suggested through our research on travel sites like TripAdvisor and we were very pleased as it was much less touristy than expected. Essaouira was a lovely coastal town but a touristy. I highly recommend the \u201cfish stalls\u201d. A market of fresh fish, you choose and purchase, and next door is prepared to your liking in an outdoor restaurant area. Chefchaouen, a beautiful hillside village, located in the Rif mountains\u2026artistic blue-washed homes and wonderful place to wander. Fes was definitely a much larger city than Marrakech. We preferred Marrakech. The square of djemaa el Fna is always entertaining and of course, brushing-up on negotiating skills with time to shop amongst the various souks is a great experience and fun!"

It ended with a home cooked meal and ethnic live music. In the morning, we awoke to the beautiful sunrise. Which in itself was worth the trip. But... All credit goes to our tour guide Said who truly made the trip with my family unforgettable. He explained to us the history of morocco and it's people. The religion and work that beholds Morocco's culture. With Said, we felt as if he wasn't our tour guide but rather a close friend of ours who always was professional yet so much fun.

We loved each and every one and each one was just right for our family. Said also worked with us to ensure we either received a family room or 2 rooms close together, and being low season we could usually make the choice.The vehicle used was also perfect, and being a large Toyota Prado 4x4 we felt completely safe and ready to take on any roads. It allowed us to see some of the off-the-road parts of Morocco that other tours may miss. Plenty of room for bags and the family of 4 so we didn\u2019t need to use the roof-rack.We undertook a 12 day odyssey of Northern Morocco and probably covered a little too much ground, but we did see a lot this wonderful country has to offer. We travelled to Marrakesh, Essaouira, Taroudante, Quarzazate, Dades Gorge, Merzourga, Fez, Chefchaouen and Tangiers (only to depart) and there were some long days of driving in there. But also many highlights and great experiences so hard to decide what we may have amended. Definitely the night in the Berber camp at Merzourga was a highlight, amidst the spectacular red dunes of the Sahara, stunning clear sky and lots of fun for the kids. But the other places each had something to offer the tourist. My most nervous part of booking the tour was sending the deposit! Always a bit worrying sending money to an organization you don\u2019t know, and we elected to use a bank transfer over Western Union (the latter which is easier for Soul Adventure I think). We paid a 10% deposit and the balance on arrival, and I am pleased to report my caution was not required as everyone and everything was as arranged prior. I can also report Said is also utterly and completely honest \u2013 twice we amended or changed hotel arrangements and twice he ensured we received the refund of any difference quickly (aside from loaning me cash when we ran out of ATMs one day!).So I would completely recommend Soul Adventures for your Morocco Tour and would happily respond to any queries or questions. The tour was easily arranged, priced very competitively and performed professionally throughout. As a family we loved it and had a wonderful trip with Said.Finally \u2013 we travelled completely during Ramadan which did have some impact but much smaller than we had expected. No trouble eating food and drinking in public at all, and most restaurants are open for tourists. We had one day in a more remote village where one place was closed, but Said found a second restaurant which was able to serve lunch. That was the only time over 2 weeks. Of course we also had to be a little flexible with Said, given he was fasting all day, allowing a later start time and a rest during the heat of the day. But there are far less tourists than usual and most Riads were not busy at all (choice of rooms). So overall there are no issues travelling during this time if you have to (for us it was dictated by school break).Go ahead and book with faith in these guys!"

Mohammed is an extremely nice man, who seemed more like a friend than our guide. He even showed us his own home and we got a wonderful meal there and met his family. He is always respectful, kind and funny. We saw a lot of beautiful nature, experienced the traditional Moroccan culture, food and traditions. It was an amazing trip! I would truly recommend this trip and Mohammed as a guide!"

Said made the planning from home easy. Once we arrived in Fes, Mohammed took over and showed us the sights. He always kept things fun for our three boys (7, 12 and 15) and knew just the right time to take a break or crank the music up loud. He is friendly and fun! He has great music too!We stayed in some of the most amazing places. The Riads that Mohammed and Said chose were gorgeous and always had beautifully appointed rooms, comfortable beds and delicious meals. My only regret is that we couldn't stay at some of them longer. The camel trekking and \"camping\" were a highlight for us all (I have never seen such a glorious night sky). The drive through the gorges, oasis' and Atlas Mountains were like nothing we've ever experienced before. What a breathtaking country! There was always something exciting to stop and see.One note, watch out for the monkeys at the Atlas Cedar Forest (Azrou); they bite!I cannot say enough good things about this tour company. They took really good care of us and I feel that our family made a friend in the process. Thank you, Mohammed!We hope to come back again one day."

We got to see various desert ruins, black sand, mirages and sand dunes. We rode on camels to desert camps, and we also spent a night stargazing in the desert after feasting on a Moroccan dinner and listening to the locals' music. I also found the desert tour particularly enjoyable because of the lack of tourists (so no one spoils your photographs). This is one of the most authentic travel experiences I have ever had, and I would strongly recommend this to anyone visiting the beautiful country of Morocco."

It was one of the best guided tours we've experienced. The highlights:- Said clearly cares about the comfort of his guests. He inspected the hotel rooms we stayed at before we entered and checked in with us frequently to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. Without us asking, he even requested a private Berber tent camp and small toilet for us for the one night we spent in the desert. The camp can sleep up to 40 or 50, so to have it all to ourselves was a huge luxury.- Said never rushed us or appeared bored. He seemed content to wait for us and work on a flexible schedule.- Excellent selection of activities and views. Our favorites were the ksar of Ait Ben Haddou, desert camping, and eating traditional tagine at his family's home. Other cool activities were searching for wild Barbary apes in the cedar forests of Azrou, having mint tea in the tent of a Berber nomad, and taking in all the amazing gorge views.- Excellent hotel and restaurant suggestions. We were very happy with Chez Pierre and Riad Madu (see my reviews) and every meal we ate.We have hired several tour guides in different countries and this is by far one of the best and most comprehensive. I would highly recommend Said and Soul Adventure 4x4!"

Our trip with Soul Adventure was not only a great adventure, but as well a trip during which we could learn a lot about the country and have fun at the same time. Our guide was very friendly and could explain us a lot about all the different parts of the country through which we were driving in order to get to our main destination, the Merzouga desert. We appreciated especially that out guide himself was born in the Merzouga desert and could thus tell us a lot of anectotes about the magig place. While he was speaking about his country, we could feel his enthousiasm and love for the country and the region. Also, he was always happy to answer all of our curious questions about tradition and culture. He was a very attentive, but respectful person, which made it pleasant to travel with him. During the trip, we had the chance to stop at many different, beautiful places in order to enjoy traditional food or the amazing view. All in all, our trip was a unique experience that we will never forget, and surely recommend to everyone!!"

The Country is beautiful and has an incredible variety of natural attractions, from the snow in the mountains area to the hot Saharan desert. We spent several days visiting all the most important cities and the numerous monuments, markets, restaurants and so on. We also bought beautiful and inexpensive artisanal handicrafts, ceramics, carpets and the like. Said was a great and very patient host, very accommodating for our needs and wishes, as well as his drivers and the guides that he selected in every place, all very competent and knowledgeable.I recommend this company to everybody willing to visit Morocco, any time of the year."

It was my wife & I on our honeymoon, we went to Spain then by ship to Morocco, the driver picked us up on time from the port, drove us to all the places we asked him for, we even needed to try things outside of our agreed upon trip (a Moroccan bath which I recommend anyone to ask for that in their trip) and he spent the extra time & effort to find us one of the quality hammams (tourists baths as they call them), we were even a bit picky on the food, and the driver accommodated all of our requests and took us to the right places (restaurants) to try the types of food we were craving. The hotels were so unique and awesome. He even helped us with bargaining with the locals at the market for the shopping we did. The other tour guides (because in the old parts of the cities we visited (Fes & Meknes), the company hired a dedicated tour guide and they were very friendly and knowledgable. Also the driver has the advantage of speaking the 2 main languages spoken in Morocco which is Arabic & Amazighi and his English was really good. I highly recommend this Soul Adventures and their private tours. And just to be fair the owner/manager of the company used to call the driver a few times a day to follow up on us and spoke with me a couple of times to check on us and make sure everything is ok and all is according to the plan.Now as for Morocco, it is a beautiful country, we only had 5 days to spend in Morocco but I wish we had more time to see more, the hotels we stayed at the majority of times were called (Riyad) and the manegers/owners of these Riyads were very friendly people, I remember there was a wedding in Meknes after midnight and I really wanted to see it, so the owner of that Riyad opened the door for me and let me record the wedding and watch the locals dancing in colourful clothing, was beautiful. I even wanted to try McDonald's while we were there and they sent their driver to get us a meal (we paid extra obviously but they were very accommodating).Just a general tip if you are going to Morocco:1. If you agree on paying by euros, make sure you bring euros with you. Same if you agree on US dollars then bring US dollars with you. I am from Canada and I did not bring Euros with me (which was a mistake) because the local exchange rates are different from the international rates. And on that note, Morocco is a very safe country, the people are not wealthy yet very friendly. And the driver is super trustworthy, he helped me many times in finding local currency exchanges to pay for things, I even made a mistake and paid him extra one time, and he corrected me and paid me back and that was very honest and kind of you, he really deserved every euro of tip I gave him.2. Cellular internet is not the best in Morocco (I mean the data on mobile phones) but at all the hotels they was wifi connections and it worked so that was good.That's it really, again, thank you Said from Soul Adventures and I look forward to coming to Morocco again for another trip (hopefully soon)."

His brother Said, who is also a tour guide was extremely nice as well and helpful arranging the trip before getting there. We chose this agency because some friends had already traveled with them in the past and highly recommended them and we were really happy that we followed their advice.

We passed through a diverse landscape full of wonder, including mountains, gorges, valleys, oases and sand dunes. He was willing to stop from time to time for us to take photos, and he showed us interesting things around the area. He also brought us to restaurants which served good local food. Having a native Berber guide who knows this area well is a great advantage. Mohammed and his family lives near the Sahara desert, and we could feel his genuine love and care for his fellow people. He took us to a nomad tent on the edge of the desert, and we had a glimpse of the hard life this nomadic family was living. We also visited a poor family who lived in a traditional Berber house in the mountains. These visits were invaluable chances for us to encounter Berber culture and lifestyle.Mohammed was a great travel companion too. He was cheerful, playful, and always weared a smile. His natural warmth and care impressed us a lot!"

Said and Mohammed are the best guides we could have asked for - friendly, unbelievably helpful and sweet, full of life and information about Morocco. We got a great feel of the place. The most important thing is that this tour is not very expensive and is well worth every penny you pay. The fact that we missed Said and Mohammed after our trip is enough to say how amazing our time with Soul Adventure was.

From the beginning they were extremely responsive and helpful, starting with the planning of the trip and continuing all the way to the end. With e-mails flying back and forth, Said took our rather vague preferences (we want to stay in riads and auberges and do a lot of walking\u2026 Oh, and also, not too many day in cities\u2026and we are interested in local food) and constructed a wonderful personalized 10 day tour of (mostly) Berber Morocco that was perfect for us. Their choices of \"riads and auberges\" for us to stay in were outstanding, truly Moroccan places of various kinds that pleased us immensely. Many were so out-of-the-way that we would never have found them on our own. They ranged from rather simple kasbahs to former palaces (one was even in a beautiful building parts of which dated to 1378!) but all were very clean and comfortable and every single one had friendly and welcoming management. Most were locally owned and operated, which I appreciate, both because I like to meet local people and because I prefer to spend my tourist dollars where they will benefit the local economy. Mohamed was a truly excellent driver--the best I've had in this kind of tour. I always felt completely safe whether we were moving at high speed on the highway, threading our way through chaotic city streets, or bumping down a rocky 4-wheel drive track leading to a nomad family camp. Said was with us too, and together the two of them took perfect care of us. They were friendly and good company, and showed us many facets of Morocco we would not have found on our own. They arranged local food (wonderful) for us and sought out local markets to show us. I was especially grateful for Said's help with bargaining; I always felt he was on our side in all transactions. Finally, the local guides they found and recommended for the cities and historical sites were always excellent. Overall, I can't think of a thing I would complain about.  I highly recommend SoulAdventure4x4 for your trip to Morocco -- Their prices were far lower than comparable tours arranged by USA or European travel companies and you will get a much better, more personalized experience."

It was life made easy without ever losing the feeling of adventure.

If you don\u2019t have a spirit of adventure and a very open mind you will not have embarked on this sort of journey. The scenery is breathtaking, ever-changing, fabulous .... I run out of adjectives! We each took over 500 photos. Mohamed speaks excellent Spanish and his English gets ever better, especially after being with us for ten days!

Our driver was extremely skilled, which matters a lot when driving through the hairpin turns of the High Atlas, and we always felt like Said was looking out for our best interests. Perhaps the best illustration of this was after we had eaten an overpriced lunch at a restaurant that did not deliver what it had promised, Said went in and negotiated a refund on our behalf. We didnt ask him to do this, but he noticed my husband's annoyance with the restaurant and just quietly solved the problem for us. This is just one example of the very high level of customer service we continually received. The hotels, restaurants and camel trek that Soul Adventures arranged for us were great, and we really felt like we got great value for our money with this trip. We highly recommend Soul Adventures."

Our guide (Mohammed) took us deep into the remote villages and valleys in the heart of Morrocco, shared with us his passion and knowledge of the people and their traditions. Because of his extremely personable personality, we were able to see first-hand how many of the nomads and other native Moroccans live. Where other guides and their clients would just walk or drive by a nomad camp, Mohammed would manage to get us invited in for tea. He was great with the kids and quickly felt like part of the family. He was very attentive to ensuring we were satisfied with the hotels and restaurants and went above and beyond in providing us a relaxing and adventure-filled vacation. Whenever the drive got a little long, Mohammed would pull over, crank up the tunes and get us all dancing and laughing.

We turned into company called Soul Adventure 4x4 and we have been met like friends, not random tourists. The agent (Said) has suggested us best places to see on the way to the desert and has spent with us 3 entire days, helping us around. Without him, we would never find some amazing place hiden in the middle \"of nowhere\" :)He has been kind and treated us as a part of his family, buy inviting us to his own house to make time, while the sun goes a bit down, for us to be able to handle the heat in the desert. Experience of having lunch in maroccan house with maroccan natives was so exciting. I am very greatful, wehave met these people! I suggest to everybody to use service of Soul Adventure 4x4"

My boyfriend and I just got back from a week in Morocco, and just to hit the punchline up front - we could not possibly imagine having enjoyed our trip without Lahcen, Said, and Mohammed, who together run Soul Adventure 4x4. Look no further for a guide \u2013 it\u2019s easy to be skeptical of these Tripadvisor posts but trust us when we say that these guys made our trip; they were easy to communicate with in advance, planned a fantastic trip, but most of all, were incredibly genuine, good people, and we left feeling as if we\u2019d made good friends in Morocco.We\u2019d done an exhaustive amount of research before leaving New York for our trip, both on TripAdvisor and elsewhere, for the right guide, since we had a pretty specific idea of what we were looking for. We had three days during which we wanted to start in Fez, drive all the way out to Merzouga and spend a night in the desert in the Erg Chebbi dunes, and then make our way back to Marrakech. Said was impressively responsive on email, and understood our needs and was accommodating in arranging the trip, and also made very helpful suggestions. Lahcen (who speaks five languages, including perfect English and French, among other things) was there waiting for us in Fez to start our trip, exactly as we had arranged, and ended up being a fantastic guide. They even welcomed us into their home on the drive out into the desert, where we had tea with their family, getting a true genuine experience.They arranged for a great night out in the desert (was just the two of us and our guide) and then we had a very easy drive back, spending the night in Ouarzazate, and then ending in Marrakech. To top it all off, Lahcen, who also happened to still be in Marrakech, even insisted on meeting us a day after our tour had ended to drive us to the airport from our riad in Marrakech.All in all, we can\u2019t speak highly enough of the team \u2013 we highly recommend Soul Adventure 4x4!"

Lachen and Mohammad were so easy to work with. They helped design the tour for the things we wanted to see and had good ideas about things we didn't know about. The price for a guide and private 4x4 was excellent. We were treated like guests and not like tourists. For those who want to see Morocco beyond the what t typical tourist company can arrange, I highly recommend this company."

I was not very involved in the planning of the trip, as my husband did all of the research and found Soul Adventure 4x4 through Trip Advisor. Said and Lahcens friendly faces greeted us at the airport and our adventure began. We toured many cities and covered very diverse terrain including the magnificent atlas mountains. I must say, driving those hairpin curves were best left to \"the experts\" and Lahcen's driving skills were nothing short of awe inspiring! I felt that we were in great hands with both of them. They were so accommodating and thoughtful and quickly became part of our family. We had a great time experiencing Morocco's many treasures: the beautiful and other-wordly landscapes, the amazing history, beautiful and inspiring design, archeological treasures, and the warm and welcoming people and their culture. I will always remember this vacation for the wonderful time we shared as a family , and for Said and Lachen's role in all of it!"

My husband and I recently visited Morocco and experienced the best vacation ever! i want to share my favorite part of our trip with anyone who is looking forward at visiting Morocco. my favorite destination was the desert of Merzouga, so here is what we experienced :After a peaceful night of sleep we departed with Said in his 4x4 to visit the local villages. In the village of Khamlia we watched the traditional dances and music of Gnawa. We visited bazaars and bought ourselves turbans to prepare for our afternoon camel trek into the dunes. For lunch Said took us to his family\u2019s home where we enjoyed a delicious homemade traditional dish of Kalia and tea made by his grandmother. After two hours of camel trekking into the highest dunes in the world we arrived at the oasis which is located bellow one of the highest dunes of the desert. We enjoyed a cup of tea while meeting other tourists from around the world. Dinner is prepared by the camel men that led us to the oasis. After dinner we enjoyed the dances and the music of the drums played the same men who cooked our meal. These camel men are truly amazing, they speak many languages, trek us through the dunes, cook our meals, entertain us with dancing and music, tell jokes and fix your turban! Very hospitable. Before we retired in our Berber tent for the evening we walked through dunes, enjoyed the stars and listened to the camels chewing. We awoke early the next morning to enjoy the sunrise over the dunes. It is amazing how the sand dunes changes color from beige to a yellow orange color during this time. After this we camel trekked back to the Kasbah for showers and breakfast. It was now time to say goodbye to Merzouga. If you ever plan on visiting Morocco, Merzouga is a must see. Our tour guide, Said, was one of the best guides I have ever had the privilege of dealing with, he was knowledgeable about all the destinations we visited, humorous and very gracious. Soul Adventure 4x4 made this trip absolutely enjoyable by making it completely carefree. My husband and I will definitely return to this beautiful country to experience more of what it has to offer and we will definitely use the same excursion company."

We stopped at the market first and then onto the Argan Oil Cooperative, both of which were really interesting, We also had a camel ride booked which was great fun and took lots of photos. We then moved on into the mountains and stopped to see several children on the way up. They love any small gifts from colouring pens to small rucksacks which they find very useful. The view on the way up was breathtaking and we could stop at any point to take photos. Adil took us to a Berber house for a wonderful lunch. The food was excellent and it was so interesting to see it all being cooked in clay tagine pots. The view for lunch was wonderful and we sat outside in a comfy seating area. The ladies preparing and cooking the food were lovely. Thank you Adil for such a memorable day in the Atlas Mountains which we will always remember. We will most certainly return some day.

It was really set to be the highlight of our trip.Our guide Aziz, was at our riad for 9am sharp as arranged, and we set off for our adevnture. When first sitting in the car, he pointed us to plenty of bottled water to keep ourselves hydrated, which was a nice touch.Our first stop was a once weekly traditional Berber market, that is held every sunday. Aziz had a fountain of information about the history of the market, that was interesting to hear, and an experience to see! Whilst walking around, I mentioned that I could have wheat, and we had a brief discussion about this. He then made a phone call to our lunch location, where he made sureI had plenty to eat. I was extremely pleased with this, and found it incredibly thoughtful. He even took the time to ask what parts of the markets we would like to look at, taking into consideration the vegetarians in our group. He asked if we would like to avoid the cattle, and butchery. for example. Again, a very lovely gesture.We stopped at several places to get some good photo opportunities, and Aziz was always happy to wait, but also to give us some history of the areas.Our next stop was for a mint tea at what i can only describe as a roadside cafe. Located at the foothills of the Atas Mountains. There were tables and chairs placed in and around the water, where you could take in the surroundings, and get some refreshment.Our next stop was the Argan Oil Cooperative, where he told us that we could use a nice toilet, which by this point, was much welcomed! It was a very intersting place to visit. I am trying not to go into too much detail of the content of these visits, as it's for everyone to experience in their own way. We certainly enjoyed them, and found them a positive addition to our trip.The journey to the mountains was one of beauty and splendour, with the most breathtaking views I have seen, and we were becoming more and more excited about our arrival, as a tummys were rumbling! Nothing can prepare you for the setting where we had our lunch, and we will truly never forget our time there. The food was sublime, and the setting was something we were totally in awe of. The trip was well organised, fairly priced, and our guide Aziz was a real gentleman. He stopped by the roadside to buy us fruit, he served us tea, and he even helped us across the busy road. He was funny, kind, and very knowledgeable, with a bit of a thing for Celine Dion. Well no one is perfect!I highly reccomend this trip, and ther is so much more I could write. But i urge you to experience it for yourself! I know you wont be disappointed!Thank you Aziz and Adil, you made our day very special!"

It was a superb day, hosted by Aziz, who is an extremely knowledgable and kind local man who used to live in a Berber village. The 4x4 was very comfortable with proper seat belts and plenty of water and Aziz was a great driver...there are a lot of very windy roads, best not to look down too much!We visited a weekly farmers market which was a real eye opener and sold everything from second hand crocs to cow's hooves and you could find farriers to dentists there!! As it was a genuine market for villagers we weren't hassled at all, it was a fantastic cultural experience and the children learnt lots. We visited an Argan cooperative, had a fun camel ride and a very memorable lunch at the wonderful home of a Berber couple, eating a beautifully cooked chicken tagine, 6000 feet up in the Atlas Mountains. I couldn't recommend this more highly."

Before going into the trip I have to mention the booking of this I contacted Adil via email to ask questions about the trip he always responded very quickly and with everything I needed to know. I didn't have to pay for the trip up front I paid cash to the guide on the day after I had been on the trip.I can't recommend this trip enough for anyone that wants to visit and see the real Marrakesh. My husband and I were collected on time by our excellent tour guide Abdou Alah. We were picked up in a immaculate Toyota 4x4 with a bottle of cold water for both of us. Abdou spoke excellent English and was very knowledgable about the area and the people. Our first stop was the market, and for those of you that have visited the market in the city, this is nothing like that it is a market to walk around and witness the real lives of the Berber people.The next stop the camel ride which was a wonderful experience we were taken off road on the camels on our own so no problem with traffic etc. It was obvious by the condition of the camels they were well taken care of. We were on the camels for about 20 minutes finishing to have tea under a Berber tent.After a short drive we were at the Argan oil cooperative. This is a locally produced oil found only in Morocco and hand made by women which is very labour intensive, here you have the opportunity to buy product but no pressure is ever put on you to do so.We followed the mountain road through many villages meeting lots of locals including children. We had taken Adil's advice and had taken pencils, pens and pads to give to the children, the delight on their faces when they had a new pen and pencil to go into school with was priceless.Lunch was served at a family Berber house overlooking a local village and with a fantastic view of the Toubkal mountain. You couldn't ask for a better place and view to have lunch and the traditionally cooked food was fantastic.After lunch we took the mountain road back into Marrakesh and were dropped off at our hotel.During the trip there were lots of opportunities to take photos, stop when you wanted to and ask any questions you have.Another positive about this is you see how much Adil is giving back to the community.I guarantee that when you have been on this trip you will have a different opinion of Marrakesh and hopefully it will be the highlight of your trip like it was ours."

We learned much about the Berber people, the valleys and the Atlas mountains throughout the day, whether it was touring the Berber markets, stopping to take in the breathtaking views across the valleys and the river, meeting the Berber children in the mountains (please do take Adil's recommendation of taking some stationary or school supplies for the Berber children - you'll see just how difficult it is for them to obtain these things when you visit, and the children see the car coming and will all come rushing out their houses to wave at you) touring the Argan oil co-operative or having lunch at a Berber house with the most amazing view - everything on the tour is considered and benefits the local community.

After visiting a local market, we drove through the Atlas mountains and stopped at an Argan Oil cooperative. We learnt a lot about the hard work involved in producing the oil. At no time we felt pressured to buy products, but we wanted to. The women working in the cooperative are divorced or widowed and by purchasing their products you support them in raising their families. On the way we made multiple stops every time we wanted to take pictures or stretch out. In the afternoon we had lunch in a traditional berber house with a wonderful view. The food was one of the most delicious I had in Morocco - all cooked with ingredients from their garden that we toured around. Adil is doing a great job in supporting the locals by bringing tourists to experience the real berber's life. Well spent money on this experience."

He did a commentary as we journeyed towards the mountains quite happy to answer our questions whether related to the trip or about morocco in general. He was happy to stop for photographic opportunities or just to watch and enjoy something of interest. First stop the food market in a local village. Fascinating to see how the locals buy and sell their produce and to hear how it all works. If you are squeamish then let your guide know - they do things differently here!Next stop a carpet and ceramics place. Yes they showed us their wares but absolutely no pressure and were keen for us to see the views from the hilltops and drink mint tea. Adil gave us the option of tar or off road - we chose the latter and he drove superbly on narrow dirt roads. Lunch in a superb spot in the mountains overlooking a valley.

We were treated to mint tea with nuts and dates, etc and shown the various wares. Obviously they are keen that you would buy something but there really was no pressure. The gentleman who showed the carpets was just that, a gentleman; quiet and respectful. We also went to an argan oil cooperative and saw the traditional method by which the women would get oil from the nuts. Interesting little tour and it was openly and politely explained to us at the beginning that we would be shown their wares as this was how they kept the coop going. There are some nice things but they are eye-wateringly expensive. Again, little pressure to buy but I was less comfortable there.Lunch was at a beautiful and intensely peaceful spot, where we were sat outside and brought freshly baked Moroccan flat bread, traditional tomato salad, couscous and chicken tagine with vegetables; all delicious!Aside from that we stopped in numerous places to take photos and Adil was more than happy to take pictures of us: quite a photographer!

I did my research before leaving home, and wanted to see the real Morocco, and I loved the reviews on here.From the moment Adil no2 met us from our Riad door we knew we were in for a treat.Prior to leaving I had brilliant communications from Adil via email and detailed explanations of what to expect, which made me feel comfortable.Adil no 2 walked us to the comfort of the luxury 4x4, when approached by street hassles he firmly reacted, and explained how and why it was unacceptable.Adil took us to the tranquil mountains, to meet the camel folk who did not hassle but welcomed us, a vast difference from the old town of Marrakech.We loved the camel trek and tea after.We then stopped at a local shop on my request to look at a rug, with no pressure sales, and Adil even helped me barter over half the price off all my wears.Adil then took us round a Berber Market which was a proper friendly place with no pressure to buy anything, we just absorbed the local experience, smells and wears. This followed by a comfortable journey into the mountains to witness unique hand made Aegean products, again information and no pressure to buy, but just sample the benefits of the products.We stopped along the way in the remote areas to give gifts to the Berber children of books, pencils and pens which they were very grateful for and you feel like you have given a little back.We went through the beautiful mountains to go to a traditional Berber home for the most welcoming beautiful lunch.Traditional salad and bread starter, Chicken tagine and vegetable cous cous, followed by mint tea and sweet bread.Amazing food, Stunning setting and time to relax before heading back to Marrakech.Adil no2 was so informative, helpful, skilful and friendly.You must experience this trip if you can to see the real Morocco.Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful culture."

We were very glad we booked the tour because it was the highlight of our Morocco experience. We were able to visit the local market which was neat to see in contrast to the tourist areas. We had great views during the whole trip and learned a lot from Adil (#2) who was driving us. The car and ride was very comfortable. In general the roads are actually very smooth and in good condition. The lunch was also amazing, way more food than we could eat but our best meal during our time in Morocco! There were great views during lunch and it was very relaxing to enjoy the meal outside in the mountains. Adil also helped us buy some fresh figs during the trip which were wonderful to try and they were right in season. My only tip is when you go the Argan Oil Co-op ask the prices of the items before you decide what to buy. We thought the samples were delicious and decided to get a number of things to bring home as souvenirs but due to the high cost wished we would have purchased less."

We were having breakfast at 9AM when our guide arrived perfectly on time but he was courteous enough to let us finish before taking us to the car. The Toyota Land cruiser used was in excellent condition and was spotlessly clean inside and out.We then set off on a 30 minute drive to the mountains where we were talked though the vast history of Morocco which I will not spoil for anyone taking the tour. Before going up the mountain we got to ride camels which was entertaining. The drive up the mountain is truly breathtaking and so different to the crazy atmosphere within the Medina. You see Berber kids travelling to school smiling and waving who are so happy with so little which should give anyone from the west a different perspective on their life.We were taken to the Berber markets were the food and spices smelled amazing! After a trek up the mountain of which we stopped many times to take photos and with some of the best views I've ever seen we arrived at the restaurant were we got to see our food prepared fresh for us. We had finely chopped tomato, coriander and onion salad which was seasoned to perfection and served with the bread which was still hot. A chicken Tagine was then served with slow cooked carrots and potatoes which was just fantastic. After that we received cous cous with more vegetable we were absolutely stuffed! To finish we had mint tea with some home made biscuits.I could go on for hours but you get the point- do it! You won't regret it. I was told during the trip that they have other packages were you camp out up the mountain get to see the galaxy as the atmosphere is so thin and there's little light pollution. I'll definitely be back cheers from Ireland!"

Adil responded quickly and we agreed everything over email. 2 days later we were met in our hotel by Adil no.2. and taken on a wonderful day trip to the atlas mountains.Adil no.2 was brilliant and his local knowledge and historical understanding was impressive. Adil really made us feel extra special, he explained so much about morroco and the berber people. You really get a local person who knows everything about the area and knows the locals well.The tour consisted of driving about an hr to the atlas mountains but Adil was so informative and relaxed it was a pleasure in beautiful scenery. We visited a local berber market where the villagers went for food and clothes it was very interesting and we were totally comfortable with Adil leading the way. We then went on a nice 20 min camel ride around the valley hills it was lovely with super nice locals and amazing scenery felt really authentic topped off with tea under shade with the camel herder paid 200 dirnham for the camel ride extra well worth it. As ever Adil no.2 was looking out for us and ran after us when we started and asked the camel herder to change my camel as he felt it didn't want to work..the other camel was much better and I had a more comfortable ride. This shows a little of how eager they were to make the day special. We then drove through the mountains to a women's cooperative for argan oil was made to feel very welcome and it was interesting to see how they produce the oil by hand, it was a bit pricey in their shop but we felt it was good to have the money go directly to the locals paid 500 dirnham for a lovely gift box.At our request Adil stopped at a locals shop whom he knew well and stated he wouldn't hassle us. The owner was lovely and not like the stall owners in marrakech. Prices were better then marrakech and Adil had told us the level of haggling that was expected so we got a great Deal, as we were with Adil we also sat down for tea with the owner whilst he showed us samples of his rugs and Adil translated it was brilliant and even though we didn't buy any the owner was still very happy.We then drove through the mountains and I can't describe how beautifully stunning it was there with all the villages dotted around. Do try and take notebooks, pencils and colouring pens for the kids they are often on the road and their faces light up when we or Adil gave them stuff..again part of the experience and you meet more locals this way. The lunch in the mountains was wonderful probably the best we had. We met the family and helpers and made to feel welcome with a tour around the house. We went back to marrakech with Adil 2 and one of the family members with a number of stops as I wanted cigs and despite 3 shops not having my brand Adil insisted on trying others..he was great throughout. Long review but thought it should be to show what you get and hopefully you decide to use them as it was the highlight of our 7 day stay..forget about the tours from the hotel do this one it might be a bit more expensive but it is your own tour with local people who speak great English and really look after you!"

Adil was very quick in responding to our email, and answered all of our questions prior to the tour. At 9am the following morning we were picked up by Aziz from our hotel and we headed out on our tour of the Atlas Mountains. We first visited the Farmers Market at the foot of the mountains, truly eye opening (and non of the usual haggling like in the Medina). It was a great experience. This was where all of the locals from the surrounding villages visited on a Sunday to sell their produce and socialise, there's even a pop-up barbers and dentist, as health care is really expensive in Morocco. We then visited a Berber Museum in a local Berber village, the Museum was in a building that used to house the village Chief some time ago, but now a Mayor takes his place, taking care of a group of villages. The young guy who walked us around had grown up in the village, we learnt so much about the Berber heritage and their ways of life. Travelling further into the Atlas Mountains, we met a group of women who produce Argan Oil with their bare hands! (It takes them a week to produce 1 litre)!! We carried on through the valleys for our lunch stop with a local berber family, the location was absolutely breathtaking - looking over the Atlas Mountains whilst we enjoyed a meal that was better than any of the restaurants in the Medina we'd eaten at! We would stop along the way to take in the awe inspiring views and Aziz would speak to the local children, and even hand them gifts at times! A really nice touch.The tour was so informative and relaxed, we learnt so much over the course of the day. I'd highly recommend this once in a lifetime tour if you're visiting Marrakech. Thank you Aziz and Adil for a great day!"

He even comforted us that we won't be pressured into buying things or doing anything we didn't want. What is lovely is that he asks you to bring books, pens, etc for the kids which is really nice. We took sweets, books and pens and it was heartwarming to see the children get excited. However, lunch with the most breathtaking view was the best part of it all. It was so relaxing and just beautiful! Highly recommend this trip!"

Great food and beautiful location for a late lunch towards the end of the tour. I would recommend that the prices are lowered at the women's cooperative. THe products were clearly of a high quality but were x2/x3 more expensive than they would be England which just seemed way over priced. TIp for couples... Invite another couple along from your riad! The price is significantly lowered and you can enjoy their company also, the car is full which feels more ethical and Adil is happy too! Great memories, thank you!"

During that time the main person had an accident and tore her anterior cruciate ligament and although there is no hiking during the tour she was told a week before we went to Marrakech by her doctor that she couldn't do any light walking either. So although i am unable to comment on the tour itself, from the moment i made the enquiry until we cancelled, Adil was absolutely brilliant... he replied quickly to emails/enquiries i had about the tour and was very understanding when i explained the situation and had to cancel. He even offered his help if we needed it or recommendations during our stay. We were all upset we couldn't do this tour but hope to do it one day ;-) Thank you again Adil for being so understanding."

This is a proper professional company and both of drivers were very knowledgeable with good command of English which made our tour more enjoyable. First of all thanks to our nephew who booked everything by emailing them and he told us they were very professional and helpful they didn't even ask for any up front payments all was done via emails. During our trip to Marrakesh there were 10 of us so the company sent two 4x4 to pick us up from our hotel. Very efficient both drivers were on time and very friendly. Our day trip to Atlas Mountains started with stop over for camel ride around the valleys of Marrakech then a drive to the Berber village where we had enough time to explore the local market. Then we stopped to see the organ oil cooperative factory/ store which is managed by ladies. There was no pressure from anyone to buy any of the products it was all up to us. Both of drivers stopped the cars at so many different a points in order to give us plenty of opportunities to take photos it so was relaxing that we didn't feel any pressure of rushing as you would do when you go with a large group of tours. By the afternoon we reached the top of the Atlas Mountains where we were taken to a Berber house and the ladies there prepared home cooked food for our lunch. It was one of the best most delicious traditional Moroccan couscous with chicken and vegetable tajeen we've ever had! All prepared from the freshest ingredients and organically sourced from their own tiny garden. The scene from their house was breath taking. I've never experienced so much calmness and heartfelt peace in my life before! Sigh! Sadly the day had to come to an end so we were driven back and dropped to our hotel by 5pm. Overall it was an awesome experience with value for money I think it costed us around \u00a342-\u00a345 per person. I highly recommend this tour just remember to ask if there's any extra cost as the camel ride was at a separate charge. I Forgot to mention you may like to take some snacks with you on your day trip as the lunch was served around 2pm. But it was worth waiting for!"

Having booked a last minute holiday to Marrakech, I looked at TA to see what there was to do other than sit around the pool, but it needed to be something that would be suitable for 2 adults and 2 boys (16 & 11 years old) \u2013 no small feat keeping everyone happy! 4x4 Camel was number 1 on the list, so I contacted Adil - he was friendly and speedy in his response - really good communications, so we booked and awaited our expedition!At a little before 9am on the day of our trip, Adil#2 arrived at our hotel in a lovely air conditioned Land Cruiser, ready to take us on our trip.He told us so much about the history of Morocco, of Marrakech and about the various religions in the country; a real lesson, which we all very much enjoyed.Our route out of Marrakech towards the mountains cut through the Gardens of Agdal, which was beautiful, then we headed to the Berber Market. This was a real eye opener - so different from the market in Marrakech medina. He advised us not to take pictures, as the people were going about their normal business and were sensitive to their privacy. There were very few women (about 6) in the whole market, and Adil#2 told us that this was normal as it is usually the men that do the weeks shopping. The market was a real assault on the senses with the smells of the tagines and kofte cooking, the sounds of the people and the mules (there was a donkey park at the top of the hill!)Our second stop was the camel ride \u2013 where we were taken around an area of wasteland on our camels \u2013 the camel driver was very pleasant, although he did not speak any English, but we got by with our limited French. We rode around for about 20 minutes \u2013 a fun thing to do! Hubby had the deluxe camel \u2013 complete with water bottle holder, youngest son\u2019s camel appeared to have the wind \u2013 which lead to much hilarity!Back into the car and we headed up into the mountains, passing through the Ourika valley, and seeing what is the local resort \u2013 Adil#2 told us all about the area, how people come from all around to visit the river and the little man-made waterfall (which was only about a foot from the ground). The colours and sounds were again very vibrant.From here we drove further and stopped at a small shop which sold lots of tagines, leather goods, jewellery and pottery along with carpets. The owner invited us to join him for mint tea, which was very kind, he then showed us the various textiles produced by the different \u2018tribes\u2019 of Berber women, the designs were specific to each area, and the techniques used were so skilled. Having gone in hoping to buy a bag, I left with a small carpet instead \u2013 after some serious haggling!Our next stop along the road was the Argan Oil Co-operative. Although this was an enjoyable visit, it did feel very commercial and staged, not at all what I had expected from a co-operative. The information talk was very professional, and the samples we were shown were wonderful \u2013 the products themselves were lovely, but expensive and not open to haggling. \u00a350 for a small pot of cream and \u00a314 for a very small jar of honey.Back into the car and off to the Berber house for our lunch, the roads are a bit hairy \u2013 wiggly, windy, hair pin bends. So I arrived at the house with slightly wobbly legs! Adil#2 showed us around the house, which was very basic, but comfortable. It was very clean and tidy, and it struck us that it didn\u2019t feel very \u2018lived in\u2019 as there were no \u2018nil naks\u2019 or trinkets anywhere, which seemed a bit odd to us, especially as we were told that a family of 9 live in the house.We were taken to the back of the house, to a wonderful sheltered veranda, with low level tables & cushions to sit on. We were served tomato salad and fresh, homemade bread to start with, followed by tagines & couscous for main. Hubby & boys had the chicken tagine; silence prevailed followed by \u201cyummy\u201d, \u201cbest chicken ever!\u201d and \u201ccan I take some home?!\u201d I had the vegetable tagine, which again was delightful \u2013 I never realize pumpkin could be so tasty \u2013 the spices and flavours were so rounded and delicious. There was so much food; we couldn\u2019t finish it all \u2013 which is unheard of with our boys! Melon was served for dessert, followed by mint tea & biscus fennel biscuits.Having rested for a short while looking over Mount Toubkal, we headed back to the car to make the journey back down the mountain and into the Asni Valley, and back to the hotel.The views along the way were breathtaking, and Adil#2 was able to tell us some information about the area, he didn\u2019t constantly talk though, he waited for us to ask. He also pulled over to show us certain areas and landmarks to enable us to take photos.All in all a very enjoyable experience \u2013 thank you so much!"

I had done my homework before traveling and the endless 5 star reviews for this company were enough to convince me that this was the only option for us.So early on a Friday morning, my Son (13) by wife and myself were collected from our hotel by Aziz in a clean and modern Toyota LandCruiserThere is little to say that hasn't been said already but I will tryThe traditional market was truly eye opening and gave a real glimpse into a totally different world from the one we live in. At all times however Aziz was with us providing information and also guiding us in the right direction so that even in the chaos or the market, we always felt safe.The camel ride was exactly what you expected it to be. Something to cross off our bucket list and just as uncomfortable as everybody says but the camels appeared happy and as we trekked across the landscape, far away from anything, it really was quite an experience.Onwards and upwards into the mountains, stopping occasionally for photos and to admire the stunning views with Aziz always providing information and answering questions.The Argon Oil cooperative again gave a view into a different world and straight after that, we stopped to enjoy mint tea at the side of the river.Again we climbed higher into the mountains and eventually came to the Berber house where lunch was served and what a lunch it was. Totally authentic and something I could eat time and time again. Who thought something as simple as chicken and a few vegetables could taste so good but then again, the view whilst eating was totally spectacular.From there is was a steady return down the mountains, along a few valley floors, through various small towns and villages and back into the city and our hotel for around 4:30pmWe had an amazing day out, we got to see a totally different world to the one we live in, Aziz was the perfect guide full of relevant information and at all times ensured we were both safe and comfortable.At \u00a3150 for the 3 of us, for a private all day tour including a good lunch this experience offers great value for money and it is easy to see why 4x4 Camel is number 1 on Trip Advisor.If you are looking for a private tour when in Marrakech, I cannot recommend this one highly enough."

Our first stop was a farmer's market which was an interesting experience. A bit further on we had the option of a 20 min camel ride and was served tea. We stopped by an argan oil exhibition and saw it being made from the nut. We had samples and ended up buying a few products. We drove on through numerous Berber villages until we were nearer the top of the mountains, and would often stop to take photos. The highlight of the tour was having freshly prepared lunch at a Berber family's house overlooking the Atlas mountains. The view was AMAZING and so tranquil.The tour is worth every dirham and I would highly recommend."

And we asked for good tajines to buy and he told us not to buy it on the berber market which was on the programm but he drove us extra to a lovely shop where we got one for 70!!! So great quality and great service. And it said thag we were back at 4 o clock but because of all the extras he did with us like the fruit and the tajines shopping we finished at 17:15 so they really try to make the trip as good as possible for you!!!

A fabulous education given to us by a very knowledgable, sincere and kind man, a real tribute to his people and his country. The Berber meal high in the Atlas Mountains was promised to be the best tagine we would have in Morocco, and it most certainly was! Even our fussy son rated it very highly ... he said \"the best meal since we left NZ\" 2.5 months ago on our round-the-world tour! Thank you Abdullah and many blessings to you and your family.

I have read many reviews on TripAdvisor and have contacted all of the highly-rated tour operators. It appears to me that 4*4 Camel is by far the best. (1) They don't over- charge. They charge \u20ac180 with lunch included VS other highly-rated ones charging \u20ac220-\u20ac300 with lunch excluded. Then you have to pay \u20ac15-30 extra per person for lunch and it adds up to the a big difference. (2) Their service is good. Came to our Riad on time and Aziz, our guide was very pleasant. He went with our flow instead of rushing us from one spot to another. We had a tea break by a river and my young boys got very excited and decided to go for a swim. We spent about an hour there and he never pushed us to leave. (3) The lunch we had was very good. It was in a beautifully decorated home. It was one of the best meals we had in our trip and it was included in the tour price! (4) We visited a local market and my children were happy to see the sheep and chicken etc. People were very friendly there. (5) The car was clean and comfortable (6) The trip didn't appear to be a tourist trap. (7) Even my 5 and 7 years old boys had a great time! If you want to go to the Atlas Mountains, look no further. Different tour operators are slightly different but this one is really good enough."

He sat and had tea with us, bought us bottled water when we asked to stop and get some, and regularly checked throughout the tour if we were okay. The meal at the Berber family home was delicious and in an incredible location. It was so peaceful to sit there, eating incredible food and looking over the mountains. It's also far cooler up there than in Marrakech. A really great way to see the 'real' Morocco. Highly recommend it both for warmer weather and in the cooler months (you can then go and play in the snow on the mountains!). Thanks Aziz for being so great and to Adil for all your help.

We were picked up by from our hotel by Alid 2 (there are two Alids who work at 4x4 Camel) in an Air Conditioned 4WD. Alid took us to our first stop, which was our camel ride. This was a lot of fun! We paid extra for this and rode on camels for around half an hour. We then made a pit stop for a bathroom break at a Berber rug store where we were lucky enough to see and learn all about the amazing handmade rugs. From there we made our way to a market and walked around the stalls that sold everything from spices to haircuts.It was the Women's Co-operative where they produce Argan Oil which was a highlight. A lot of the Argan Oil sold in downtown Marrakech has been watered down, but what is sold here is purely made. The product is made only by women and the funds raised go to these women and their families. I bought some Argan Oil for cosmetic use which cost around 300 Dirhams (cheap really if you think about how much we spend on hair and skin care).We then drove through the valleys and had lunch cooked for us up high in the mountains by a Berger family. The lunch was the best meal we had on the whole trip! The food was organic and slow cooked for hours. The view overlooking the mountains was spectacular, so I highly recommend this if you are after a \"lunch with a view\".On the way back to Marrakech, I was not feeling well as I was starting to develop a bad cold. Alid offered to take me to a pharmacy where he could help me get some cold and flu medicine. Not only did Alid go out of his way to take me to the pharmacy, but he told us all about the history of the Berber people and pointed out things like apple, olive and cherry trees.If you are wanting to get out of Marrakech, the Atlas Mountains are definetly worth visiting. I highly recommend 4x4 Camel Private tours and Alid 2 as your guide."

Adil picked us up at 9.30 as arranged and started with a drive and a history of the Berber people. Adil spoke about keeping safe and how to deal with anyone that hassled us, wise words as someone decided to follow us for quite some time!! We stopped firstly at a Berber market and I wanted to buy some spices so he took us into the market to a stall I would never have found otherwise. It was so interesting and lots to take in. Next up was a camel ride, only the boys wanted to ride which they really enjoyed. We told Adil we wanted to buy a tagine for cooking in and he took us to a shop along the road and the man was brilliant making us mint tea too. We ended up buying a small rug as well that just about squeezed into our suitcase on the way home!! We then headed to the Argan cooperative (take lots of money as oil starts at \u00a345 but well worth it). This was good to see and worth spending money to support them. After that we headed further up into the mountains for lunch. The views were amazing and the food was fantastic and would have fed 8! We felt awful leaving so much of it but we couldn't physically fit anymore in!! We would have done more with this company had budget and time allowed. The kids enjoyed it which meant we had a good day and my 15 year old said it was his best day in Morocco. Thank you so much for an amazing day and memories that will last a lifetime. If we come back to Marrakesh we will book with you again!!"

Ok, I will admit it, I thought it was really fun too.)We went to a small Berber museum that showed how the Berber people have lived. We were especially impressed with the bee pot where they could harvest honey from the wall of their house and the bees lived on the other side. We also got to see an all women's argon oil production coop, a history of the rugs and textiles of the Berbers and as mentioned in the other posts, lunch at a Berber family home.It was a perfect day and I would recommend this tour for anyone who would like to know a bit more about the local culture.

All this in full view of the spectacular Atlas Mountains. A peaceful, tranquil and magical moment - broken only by the crowing of the village cockerel! Another highlight of our one-day trip was seeing the fresh, eager faces of the children as they reach out in glee for little treats, like pencils, stationery and finger puppets.

During the booking process, Adil was clear and prompt to respond (putting auto-replies to shame!) and accommodated my request to take a solo tour even though he usually cater to groups of two or more. On the day of the tour, I was greeted by Aziz, one of the most knowledgeable, professional, and friendly tour guides I\u2019ve ever met. Our first stop was at a local traditional market just outside of the city, followed by a 30-minute camel ride off the beaten path (note that this comes at an additional fee of about 100 MAD, which Adil had informed me about in advance of the trip). As we switch-backed our way through the countryside, Aziz offered eye-opening tidbits about Moroccan culture and a rich narration of the story of each village that we came across. Around midday, we arrived at our lunch site \u2013 the modest yet beautiful home of a local Berber family whose backyard gives way to a panoramic view of the Atlas Mountains. The taste and presentation of the three-course meal would blow the likes of Anthony Bourdain away! On our way back to the city via the Asni Valley, we topped off the tour with a visit to a women\u2019s argan oil cooperative.

The tour guide (Adil) was very professional, experienced and calm, he knew lots about the different parts of the tour and ensured that we were happy and comfortable. The sights we saw were breathtaking, from stunning views of the Atlas Mountains to a walk down a humble Berber market. It was nothing like we'd seen before and we would say it has been the highlight of our trip to Morroco (Marakesh). If you can afford it, treat yourself to this tour... you will not be disappointed! It's not just for couples I can see families or groups of friends enjoying it too!"

It was a wonderful experience seeing the delightful views of the Atlas Mountains, visiting the Berber Museum, seeing Argan oil being created. Best of all was eating lunch at the house of a Berber lady - the food was fantastic and we sat outside with a perfect view of the highest peak of the Atlas Mountain covered in snow. I would highly recommend this tour - especially being able to ask the driver to stop when I was desperate to take a snap of the beautiful landscape. Luis and Sita"

Promptly picked us up at our Riad at 9am and instantly we were chatting history, family, culture and politics, answering all of our questions. The drive was beautiful and lush in greens and reds. We stopped at a local market on the way to the Atlas Mountains. We decided to ride the camels and met Rashid our camel guy who took us all around the area, I highly recommend adding this experience. We then shared mint tea under a Berber tent and headed off to the Womens Argan Oil Co-op, an amazing place that supports the local women of the Ourika Valley, purchased a few products and headed up the mountains. Along the way we came in contact with so many adorable children, I highly recommend bringing a bag of candy or something small to pass out and getting out to high five them. Lunch in the Berber hut, mountain views and delicious moroccan cuisine was the perfect way to end the trip. Breathtaking views, relaxed atmosphere, be prepared to want to nap right there on the mountains, it was a surreal experience we all highly recommend you take. I also agree taking this trip earlier in your travels to learn more about the history and culture outside of the city."

We primarily chose this organization due to the outstanding reputation that the team had via Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. After booking the tour, we were not prepared for his prompt 9AM pick up at our Riad. The Riad offered us breakfast, and we were regretfully declining the meal as we rushed to meet our guide, Adil. Adil insisted we enjoy the breakfast, and waited 45 minutes for us to have what ended up being a fantastic breakfast. He did not display any disappointment or attitude for our delay; he was actually genuinely interested in our interpretations of Moroccan cuisine! We began his tour by driving outside Medina\u2019s ancient walls towards the Atlas mountains. Our drive started with the distinct Moroccan environment, of sandy tones and red buildings; however, transitioned to lush, green landscapes as we closed the distance between the mountains and us. Our travels stopped between 45 to 60 km away, and we were invited to a camel ride. My fianc\u00e9 conducted a camel ride in Egypt, and she was prepared for a similar low-quality ten minute ride in a straight line. However, she and I were delighted during the ride as it defied her expectations. The website, I recall, cited a 20 minute camel ride for a fixed price. The price was true to the site, but we recall the ride feeling at least twice as long as advertised. The terrain that we camels walked transitioned from uphill, downhills, across spurs, through sheep, and the camel trainer/master had ideal spots to take photos of my lady and me. Afterwards, we resumed our drive via Adil\u2019s 4x4. Next was a stop to a production organization of Argan oil products; crafted by a small mutually supportive group of women in a collaborative firm. Adil handed us off to a lovely tour guide of the site, and she sold my fianc\u00e9 a gift set that is now intended for her grandmother. The site is located in a valley, adjacent to a river. Again, not the typical vision of Morocco, as the landscape was dominated by green plants and blue waters. We continued our drive through the Atlas mountains, took a walk at one point, and finished with a wonderful lunch. An hour after lunch, Adil returned us back to our Riad. I highly recommend this experience and this driver! This is a must, and is very refreshing after an experience in the Moroccan markets."

Our own driver Abdullah was exceptionally polite, answered all of our many questions and was happy to chat about any conversation topic.Abdullah was very careful throughout the tour of my girlfriend's nut allergy, including when we visited the local market, argan oil cooperative and lunch with the Berber household in the mountains. The local market outside of Marrakech and the lunch were my personal favourite moments across the entire four-day holiday.The tour is for both couples and for friends in pairs.The tour was absolutely worth the time and the money. I would recommend that if travellers have more time to spare that they look for a trip that is longer than one day. And I am pretty sure that Adil and his team have longer trips available too."

Amazing day, went to local markets which was very interesting (would not of gone on our own there) but we thoroughly enjoyed this and felt very safe with Adil. It was Two Valleys day trip and we were sent the full details by phone. Went to the Argon Oil Cooperative and we all spent quite alot here, just hope the money does go to the women but think we got carried away here to be honest and not convinced that it is actually made there but anyway we went along with this. Went to a Berber house and had an amazing meal so fresh and tasty and enjoyed the lovely mountains around. To be honest could of stayed there all day. Went back to the mountains and stopped to take some photos (there are quite a lot of stops for photos which is a great opportunity as the area is so lovely). We were on our way back when we had realised that we had left one of our bags so Adil had to race back and luckily it was there, we should of finished the day at 4.00 but didnt get back until 5, he was very knowledgable and did everything that he could for us, highly recommend this company and Adil for a great day out."

He gave us some history of the Berbers on the drive towards the mountains and was more than willing to stop off where we wanted to take pictures, etc. Even though I'm not fan of heights, Adil was always very reassuring and clearly an expert driver when it comes to the mountain terrain! Meeting the women of the Argan Cooperative was a real experience, and again we were made to feel very welcome. As for lunch - wow! We won't forget that experience for a long time, just amazing!

Firstly we were picked up from our Riad and driven around for a while until we reached the destination for our camel ride, this was really fun the camel owners even stop and take lots of pictures for you which is great! Also, if you're anything like me you'll love the phone pouch attached to the camel so that you have access to your phone for all those snap chats and Instagram pics. The ride lasts around 25 minutes to which you then sit and have some Moroccan tea with your driver and the camel owner. From there we drove some more and stopped off at a Berber market which was interesting. We then went to the argon oil factory where we met the ladies who hand make! Yes... Hand make the argon oil and there was a lovely lady who explained all to us. We also got to taste some of the oils with some lovely bread. From there we drove into the mountains where we got out of the car and went on a short walk to take in the scenery and get some more photos. We then went to a families house in the Berber village where a delicious traditional Moroccan lunch was cooked for us. The views from the table were beautiful. The family even took the time to bake me a birthday cake which was extremely nice and so unexpected. 100% recommend using 4x4 camel. All the staff are so lovely and extremely knowledgable and speak English perfectly! Adil and his team definitely go the extra mile to ensure that all visitors have the most amazing time."

Argan oil is always talked about but to have someone explain the process of getting the oil is fascinating. The lunch that was prepared by a Berber family was lovely.

HahaAt the Argan oil co-op it was amazing to see how much work goes into it. There is some pressure to buy the products but we wanted to anyway. As a guide we spend around \u00a310 on an Argan soap and \u00a320 on a beautiful face cream.We then drove through the mountains stopping to look at different views. We also stopped to give some stationary we had brought for the children. I'd suggest bringing all the same stuff to avoid squabbles- unfortunately we hadn't thought of this!After a short walk we drove to the place for lunch. It was great to get the chance to see how they live- their allotment definitely puts our veggie patch in the uk to shame!!!The view is spectacular and the food is absolutely delicious. A lady having lunch there at the same time had her birthday so they had made her a cake which was a lovely touch.I feel like I have already written an essay but I could go on as we had such a great day :-)!

I got back in touch to book the tour and Adil said his colleague would pick us up at our hotel at 9am and even said that he would have a Berber family bake my wife a surprise cake when we made our lunch stop ( lunch is included in the tour price) :-)The driver picked us up right on time and told us his name was Abdullah, he said as it was a Monday we could first of all visit the Berber farmers market. We drove there in a nice Toyota Land cruiser and along the way he explained all about the sights we saw along the way. Abdullah was not only greatly informative but is very polite and very funny. Both myself and my wife not only enjoyed his tour but we could not have had a better companion for our trip. We toured the market, then taken on a 20 minute camel tour (excellent fun) then onto see the Argan Oil being made by hand. We then drove off road through some breath taking scenery up into the Atlas Mountains where we stopped for our lunch with a Berber family who had their home with a view to die for. They made us a 3 course lunch that was absolutely delicious and then to top it off Adil appeared out of the Berber house with a cake topped with candles for my wife !!!!The tour was nothing short of brilliant and when Abdullah dropped us back off at 4pm we were sorry to see him go.

The 4x4 valley tour makes a brilliant day out and offers a welcome break from the chaos of Marrakech.Adil is the perfect host - informative, friendly and enthusiastic. He's not only a great guide, but also gives you time to yourselves (ie when you have lunch at the Berber house or go for a little walk).We felt so humbled that Adil knew and helped so many of the families en route - he stopped twice to give children medical treatment (bandages and creams etc) and it's touching to see them waiting patiently at the side of the road to spot his silver Toyota. Our only regret is that we didn't bring books, pens or clothes to give them as the children clearly have nothing up in these remote villages.The bumpy drive across the top of the mountains is not for the faint-hearted, but you feel completely safe in Adil's hands. We really enjoyed the various stops - the Argan oil cooperative and the Berber market show what life is really like for many locals, well away from the bustle of the souks. As for the lunch, it was the best thing we ate during our entire trip to Morocco and the views of the Atlas mountains are literally to die for.We did the camel ride and felt it was as humane as possible - they have really thought about the location so you're not just riding along a busy road but across a pretty track with impressive views all around. For an authentic experience which is also great value for money, you cannot beat Adil's tour. A truly memorable day."

Our tour guide was very nice and so knowledgeable. We had the most beautiful lunch break ever as it was in the mountain with an amazing view and the food and the family's home was just perfect, we felt so welcome there.Would definitely recommend that trip to everyone."

            "review": "Excellent tour - Highly recommend!!. This was a great day trip and well worth the money. I strongly suggest it. We enjoyed experiencing how different it was in the mountains than the hustle and bustle and craziness in the city. Even if we had taken our rental car out on our own, we would never have seen or experienced what we did on this guided trip.It was my husband and I and our kids 10 & 14. The whole family enjoyed it! Adil #2 was great and picked us up at our hotel. He was personable, friendly, told interesting stories of the history and spoke excellent english (even thought he only learned it 6 years ago). He drove us into the gorgeous Atlas Mountains where our first stop was the camel ride. This is not a long ride; however I highly recommend it. It is a true ride where you walk through the valley along a path and get to experience the beautiful views while on the back of a camel, which in Morocco is a must. Then we went to a local market where normally just locals would go so it is not touristy at all; however still not free of being hassled by the vendors. We observed an outdoor barbershop which was definitely unusual to see, haggled over some earrings, smelled some spices and were even offered 600 camels for our lovely daughter. :-) Then we went on to the Argan Oil co-op to see where the ladies make the oil by hand. This was nice and short, but very interesting at the same time. It is expensive because it takes so long to make it...one week with 5 women working to get 1 LITER of oil! Wow!! You get to sample it at the end and it really is good and I would have liked to have bought lots; however couldn't buy large bottles due to our carry-on limit on the airplane and frankly the price! But because it is for a good cause as well, we did buy one small bottle of the body oil and the peanut/oil/honey mixture. Wow, it was delicious! We wished it came larger!Then we made our way to lunch which took about an hour to get to and we realized why we needed the 4x4. It was a bumpy ride, but the views were fabulous! Passing lots of little children walking home from school, most recognizing the vehicle and waving, hoping we would stop to give them some sort of treat. Unfortunately, we were not prepared and didn't have much to offer. But when we stopped to take a photo and were surrounded by children, we were glad when we remembered the package of strawberries we had in the car. These children were so sweet and THANKFUL to each receive ONE strawberry! Wow, that was humbling! If you remember, try to bring something to give to the many, many children along the way.The highlight of our day was the lunch, where we ate at a local Berber family home. It doesn't get more authentic than this. This is one home that sits alone among the few scattered out and has the most beautiful view overlooking the Atlas Mountains. We had our choice of sitting on the back patio on blankets and pillows in the sunshine or under a little straw cabana in the corner which blocked the wind. We chose the quaint cosy cabana where they brought us blankets to keep warm. Our son wanted to sit in the warmth of the sun, so they brought him his own little table as if he was a prince. They really did treat us like royalty, leaving nothing to be desired. The food was the best we had the entire trip and we had tagine and couscous already a few times. This was the BEST and the portions were so enormous I wished I could have eaten half and brought the rest home! We laid back on the pillows after eating as we were so stuffed! This experience was like no other and was the highlight of our trip!!We then drove back and were home in time to relax by the pool a bit before dinner. Thank you to Adil for a great day!"

He picked us up at our hotel and even taught us a few tricks when navigating around The Medina before we took off on our tour.Adil was knowledgeable and passionate about Morocco's culture and history. He was also very friendly and had a great sense humor.The tour itself was very well run. It is nice to get out of the craziness of the city center to see the Berber villages. The highlights: we stopped to ride some camels in the Ourika valley, we had tea with some local rug merchants, we met a women's cooperative for Argan Oil crafting, and the best part was a lunch overlooking the Atlas Mountains. The lunch was one of the best views I have ever seen in my life. Oh, and the food was stellar.I would highly recommend this tour to everyone. I would also recommend taking this trip the first couple of days you are in Marrakech. My wife and I really benefited from learning the history and culture from Adil before exploring The Medina on our own."

The culmination of friendly and accommodating staff, is only bettered by the view that awaits you at the top of the mountain. From the market, you will experience the culture, the land and have a personalised explanation of the history of the land. Stopping as many times as you like to take pictures and meet the locals. This trip winds itself up the Atlas Mountains. Without the meal this trip would be superb, but the meal and waiting for you at the top is worth the wait. Great value for money. A view that will stay with you. Highly recommendable."

We met Adil throughout the day and he's such a great guy! If you're thinking of booking, DO IT! I asked about payment and Abdul just said to pay at the end of the day if we were happy. For me, that speaks volumes. This was easily the highlight of my YEAR"

The tour can be flexible based on what you want to do as he is very open minded. Our tour was: Berber market, camel ride, Argan oil cooperative, lunch in the Atlas mountains, and many picture stops along the way.Adil told us the history of his company (and answered all of my probably annoying questions) and he said he makes sure everyone is 1. Professional 2. Clean 3. Is outgoing enough to be a guide - so I think all of his 4-5 person team is probably excellent as well.We also read that the lunch in the Atlas mountains is the best people have all trip - they are correct. The view is something I will remember for the rest of my life, and the food was never beat. It's a very relaxing trip although you go to a lot of places. I would recommend it for families, young people, and older people. It seems hard to find a tour that fits everyone but Adil has done it!If you are going to Morocco... this is your tour company."

We had a fantastic day with Adil (the second) :) Adil is a great guy with a lot of knowledge of Morroco history, with pleasant stories to tell you as well as a very safe driving. The car is very confortable and the trip is worth every dirham we spent. We began with a ride to to base of the valley and an amusing camel ride. After that we visited the berbere women argan oil cooperative where we saw the argan manufacturing process and we have bought the top of the top argan/almond/honey marmelade! Then we have visited pleasant places and we took a quiet and safe walk in the valley. During our way to the lunch we met several children to whom we gave pencils and books ao they can be better at school. They were so happy to reciving those simple things. It fulfills you to contribute to their development. At last we got to the breathtaking mountain spot where we had one of the best meals in morroco with direct view to the highest morrocain mountain. The whole trip was very private and of course we met Adil (the first) a great champ and also a visionary for how to well receive and provide top experience to tourists. We do recomend this trip to everyone since you will have a unique experience to absorb and share! Filipa and David"

The woman were all so inviting and polite. After crossing the bridge of Jesus we went higher into the mountains and stopped at a magnificent location where we met Adil and had the most beautiful soup, tagine and mint tea with the most stunning views of the snow topped Atlas Mountains.

He was welcoming and very charming from the start.We immediately went off for the Berber villages and the surrounding valleys. Aziz's knowledge of the area was very good, he had a well rehearsed set of lines for the actual tour but when asked about anything non-tour related, we immediately felt that he knew what he was talking about. Aziz was very insightful and enlightened us with his humble background. The tour itself was stunning for all our senses, the wonderful colours of the mountains and valleys, the smell of the surrounding areas and the sound of peace and serenity was welcoming. We visited a couple of villages and got to see a market where the locals brought goods to trade for money. This was a great example of people who are self-sufficient and relied solely on community to make a living. A revealing look into how this country and their culture works.For lunch, we were taken to a village where the owner of the tour helped a young couple renovate their home. Here, we were cooked a delightful meal (by far my favourite meal of this trip). The view from their home was stunning. We were able to see the beautiful snow capped Atlas Mountains and the green landscape surrounding the village.If you want a day away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech, then book this day tour to see the tranquility of Morocco that is rarely found in Marrakech.A must do for anyone who has a day to spare in their trip to Marrakech."

The car was clean and the first thing our driver Sayeed did was stop and buy us all a bottle of water each. He was chatty and full of information about the area and the history.The Berber market was amazing, very rustic and down to earth. Probably not good for vegetarians, some stalls were very in your face.The trip through the Ourika valley was lovely, some amazing scenery and he was happy to atop wherever we wanted for photos. We visited the camels but didn't ride, we did fall in love with the baby one though! The womens argan oil co op was great and we all got to have a go at grinding the nuts. This is no easy task and how these women do this all day in such uncomfortable positions is beyond me! 60 kg of nuts make 1 litre of oil and this takes a whole week for one woman. Don't buy oil from the souk, its most likely fake or diluted, this is the place to go. We bought some for cooking and some for our hair. They also do sales by post email margane22@hotmail.comLunch was at a Berber farmhouse high up and facing the most beautiful mountain range. The lunch was lovely and very generous , you wont go hungry!! The sun was out and they suppplied us all with sun hats to relax on the terrace, it was wonderful! Then we drove down through another valley back to Marrakech and Sayeed dropped us back at our hotel. The hotel did organise trips but I am glad I found this company as our trip was far superior and individual to anything I saw anyone else in the hotel do pays it was very similar in price. We really loved it, probably the best day of our entire holiday and Sayeed was a great driver, Adil the boss was also lovely when we met him at lunch time. Highly recommend this company!!!!"

Our day pick up from our riad, included a camel ride (reasonable fee paid to camel leaders), eye-opening Berber market experience, visit to argan oil cooperative and a scenic drive into Berber villages and an authentic lunch in with a spectacular view of the snowcapped Atlas mountains. (snow melts by May). This company works with the people of the Berber villages and has build a positive working relationship with dozens of families along the mountain drive. We brought gently used clothing, shoes and small gifts (stickers) for the Berber children. Our guide, Adil's car was recognized by the many Berber children he has donated to over several years. He has developed business relationships with a few families to employ them to prepare a wonderful, abundant, Morrocan meal for us in a traditional home with amenities like clean WC's. Adil has sincerely made friendships with several village families living along the 60 minute scenic drive. He handed out the donations to the kids. Our clothing and shoe donations were distributed to about 20 children along the 1 hour journey we took into the mountains. This isn't something every visitor has to do, but our family happened to have the clothing we would have taken to a local charity shop and planned to bring it with us to Marrakech. Pencils, notebooks or paper would be greatly appreciated if there is space in your suitcase. We learned about argon oil women's cooperative and bought quality products that help women helping themselves. We stopped for spectacular photos over a beautiful mountain river view. Adil is well spoken about Moroccan history and culture and could answer our many questions about ancient culture, language, religion and current events. His 4x4 truck is comfortable and the trip had enough interesting stops that the day went quickly. We enjoyed our time with him and appreciated his knowledge and his sincere business relationships which improve some village families lives while we get to enjoy a day of learning about Berber life and the beauty of Morocco. We highly recommend Adil and 4x4 Camel Day trip tours. Well priced! Well worth a day amongst the beauty outside of Marrakech."

When booking the trip from the UK email correspondence with the manager (Adil) was prompt and comprehensive. He arrived on time at 9am at the reception of our Riad and immediately started answering our practical queries i.e. where the best exchange rates for MAD were to get some money for the day (it's hotel Ali near Jemaa el-Fnaa by the way). The 4X4 land cruiser was spacious, clean and comfortable and two bottles of water were provided. On the drive out of the city the itinerary was explained: firstly a stop at a Berber farmers market at Al Haouz in the Ourika valley which convenes once a week on a Monday. This was an eye-opener to say the least. The market was set out in an open plan over a large mud-flat area (open toed shoes not recommended) and exhibited a huge diversity of produce from vegetables, herbs, clothing, spices, food stalls etc. It was a stark contrast from the souks of the city as although foreigners stand-out nobody takes any notice of you despite the hundreds of people there (almost all men as Adil explained that it is primarily a male role to conduct business as well as a social hub of sorts). The butchery section was rather unpleasant (and that's putting it mildly) so certainly not recommended for children or animal lovers but we tried to keep an open mind and be non-judgemental regarding what was clearly a long-established part of life for these people. Nonetheless, we were glad to get out. Again, Adil was informative throughout with commentary on various aspects of life and the market as well as safety tips i.e. being cautious of pick-pockets. From here we went to the outskirts of the village to an area of countryside with lovely mountainous views for a 20 minute camel ride with a supplementary cost of 100 MAD pp (about \u00a37). This was a highlight of the trip for us! The camels were very charismatic and clearly very comfortable with people so we weren't nervous. The young man leading the camels was also lovely, weaving a camel-shaped decoration for my partner out of a dried palm leaf he had picked on the walk and taking lots of photos and videos with good nature. From here we requested a stop at a rug merchant to buy a traditional Berber rug from the spiritual locale of their conception in the High Atlas. It was here where Adil's knowledge really shone. As he has Berber heritage, he was able to identify all the Berber tribes responsible for each design and their location in the mountains which was amazing. After some hard-bargaining we were able to get two gorgeous, hand-made, door-mat sized rugs (one wool) for 650 MAD (about \u00a347) with a little help from Adil explaining in Arabic to the merchant that despite the unfavourable profit margin for him, as students interested in the Berber peoples we would be ambassadors for their culture. This was a real privilege and a fair price for what is essentially a superlative piece of craftsmanship and heritage and much better than the questionable heritage and quality of what is typically available in the souks. From here we went to a ladies argan oil cooperative in Sti Fadma. To be honest, we were a little disappointed with this as we were really hoping for a detailed explanation of the procedure and history of the process but little was said on this. The opportunity to interact with the ladies and perhaps have a go on the millstone etc would have been great but it was clear they would not have been receptive to this (at least not that day). We were then shown into the cooperative's shop and sampled a decent range of lovely hand-made products from edible and cosmetic oils to soaps, aftershave balms and nut butters. Certainly it was all quite pricey (even by European standards - 300 MAD/~\u00a322 for 0.5L oil) but there are a few things to consider here; firstly the process of extracting the oil is VERY labour intensive requiring kilos of nut kernels from trees which only grow in a certain area of the country to extract relatively little oil by volume, secondly all sale proceeds are distributed evenly among the women who joined the cooperative to get a better life after divorce or being widowed. This in our opinion justifies the price, but you are under no obligation to buy anything. They also ship their products worldwide and unlike some of the 'argan oil' concoctions available in the souks you are guaranteed a high-quality product. From here we drove up to higher altitudes of the range along a mix of surfaced roads and dirt-tracks which was quite fun but would be a bit nerve-wracking if you are an anxious passenger. There were loads of opportunities for stunning photos throughout, suggested and taken by Adil. Giving out sweets we had brought to kids playing alongside the roads and villages en route was also highly rewarding and to see their little faces light up was heart-warming. We stopped for lunch at the home of a Berber family in Asni and ate at a low table on the terrace against the stunning mountain backdrop. The food was delicious, a vegetable soup to start followed by two large tagines - one chicken with vegetables, the other tomato with cous cous. Desert was slices of orange seasoned with cinnamon and mint tea and to my surprise - birthday cake! It turned-out my partner had told Adil beforehand and the ladies made a lovely orange blossom semolina cake garnished with desiccated coconut which was a really kind, thoughtful gesture which epitomises Moroccan hospitality. The only negative to mention is the family were quite shy and not particularly interactive. Granted there were lots of other guests on tours there but it would have been nice to actually chat to the family and get to know them as people and their lives, as it was it felt a bit impersonal but nonetheless nice. From here we made our descent back to Marrakech, passing Richard Branson's luxury hotel (Kasbah Tamadot) as well as a spectacular river gorge in Tahannaout where Mission Impossible 5 was recently filmed with yet more photos being taken. The remainder of the drive was in a peaceful silence (perhaps lunch had made us sleepy!) but Adil was always open and receptive to chat and questions. On arriving back at our Riad we were tired but contented, both physically and sentimentally with what had been an amazing, quality experience we will always treasure. The role of Adil cannot be understated in all of this either as his character and knowledge really added to the whole thing. To anyone considering this excursion I would say unequivocally: do it! the memories will be priceless."

Thanks to Adil for organising the tour and our guide Aziz who was very knowledegable and a real gentleman. We were picked up in the morning in style in a new Toyota Landcruiser. We then proceeded to the local market which was a great experience of sound, colour and smells, I wish our food here was so fresh!! We then carried on for our camel ride which again was superb. We went out for the ride and then back to a tent for some of the famous peppermint tea with Aziz and Adil. Next top was the women's Argan oil cooperative which was very interesting and we bought some fantastic products from there. After that we had a beautiful drive through the breathtaking Atlas mountains to our lunch with a Berber family. The food was out of this world very much like the view of the tallest mountain in the Atlas range which we gazed upon from our dining table. Words cannot express how wonderful the experience was!!. We then headed home though the fantastic valleys along the road seen in mission impossible V. Our guide through out was very hospitable to the point where he stopped and bought us a Tagine out of his own pocket because we said we wanted one!!I cannot recommend highly enough this company for tours, we will remember it forever. Next time we will go on the 3 day Sahara trip as we will be coming back :)"

Our driver, Aziz, picked us up and was kind, friendly and informative all day - he really looked after us. The camel ride, market and Argan oil places were fun but the real highlight and the thing which makes this trip stand out as one of our best ever was the lunch at the Berber house. The view simply takes your breath away, we were speechless and that doesn't happen often. The food and service was delicious too. Only less positive comment is that you will spend a good 2-3 hours in the car and one hour will be twisty and bumpy as you climb the mountain. It was worth it for the views and lunch but if you're car sick, take pills before you go!"

We toured the Berber Museum, Argan Oil Cooperative, Berber Villages, and the lower Atlas range. Lastly, we ate the best Chicken Tagine at a local home in a pleasant, authentic atmosphere. Truly, the food was the best I ate in Morocco. The guide was very responsive in pacing the tour with what I wanted to do; I could ask to take photos and \"chill,\" at any time during the tour. What makes this the ideal tour is the operator's attention to details; Adil and Yahya treat you as if you are their family, which creates a very welcoming atmosphere. Very cool trip!

They were very helpful with lunch options as I am a celiac. Our driver arrived on time and lead us to our comfy 4X4 for the day. We started off with a camel ride before seeing the local markets, (only open on Thursdays), before heading up he mountain to see the most stunning scenery. You will stop off where they make argan oil and a big mistake we made was not bringing enough cash as it is expensive. A cream is 800 dirham and oils are circa 600 dirham. I am still kicking myself I didn\u2019t bring enough money along as the quality is top notch, as you would expect. A strong recommendation I would advice following from previous posts I\u2019ve seen is to head to the pound shop and spend at least \u00a320 on a bag of stationary or sunglasses for the kids who will stop the car on your journey up the mountain. We bought a good loot with us and still ran out and you will be crushed when you make it to the top of the mountain and see the kids gutted faces when they realise you have nothing for them. At the top of the mountain you will have lunch with a Berber family, this will provide you with the most stunning setting for dining that I think will be difficult to top, check out the photos to see this is no exaggeration. If there is one tour you choose in Marrakesh this should be it."

We agree with all positive reviews we read before booking our Atlas Mountain day excursion with Adil.Perfect in every way from the information he shared with us, the vehicle, the views. The delicious 3 course lunch organized for us was in a comfortable Berber home with a 180 degree view of the snow covered mountain in front of us. We ate on a lovely balcony warmed by the sun.The love 4x4 Camel has for their country made us full in love with it too!"

He explained everything in detail and delivered what he promised.This is a must do excursion after a couple of days in the Medina.Also if you ask your guide about getting gifts (stones ,fossils etc..) then he can help you negotiate a fantastic price with one of the traders in the valleys. I was much happier giving my money to them then the Marrakech traders.I also learnt so much about Morocco on this trip.All in all, Top marks. Adil and his team have got this nailed to perfection."

Water was provided and the driver told us the local history at each stage of the journey. We went to a local market - another world!, then on into the mountains ( L'Ourkha valley) via the women's Argan Oil co-operative. It had snowed the night before, and the local children were enjoying building snow men. The road became a snow covered track along the mountain so the 4x4 came into its own! Lunch with the local people - Berber house by the fire and with spectacular views over the Atlas Mountains. Then home along another valley to arrive back at the Riad about 4pm. This is a must for anyone spending more than 3 days in Marrakech."

Starting from the lovely 4x4 all to ourselves and the indepth knowledge and friendliness of Adil #2. We started driving through the mountains and were in awe of the amazing views and beautiful snow capped peaks. Adil gave us detailed historical facts throughout. The Berber Museum was the first stop and it was great to learn all about life in the mountains. We then went for a camel ride... what an experience! The kids were a bit unsure but once the ride began they loved it. Definitely an experience worth doing. We then drove on further distributing stationary gifts to the children as we went. We thought we couldn't be more amazed and then we arrived for lunch. Breathtaking is the is the only way to describe the view as we sat and ate our delicious lunch at 4000ft. Snowball fights in the brilliant sunshine followed and then a beautiful drive through canyons on the way home. Everything was superb and Adil's hospitality was remarkable. If you want to explore the Atlas Mountains this is the way to do it. Next time we come to Marrakech we will try the Sahara tour with these guys. 5 star service. Thank you so much to everyone at 4x4 camel and especially Adil#2 for making this a trip to remember always \u263a"

He clearly explained everything and kept us informed every step of the way. Being a Saturday, we were unable to visit the market but instead we went to the Berber museum, which in fact was a great experience and one which we thought we would have preferred anyway! The views were breathtaking and meeting all the children and giving them our gifts of pens, crayons, note pads, socks and hats were very gratefully received and a very humbling experience. Lunch with a view was included in our trip and what a lunch and view it was! A delicious chicken tagine served by a lovely family and a fantastic vista of the Atlas Mountains. we also had a trip to a womens Argan Oil co-operative which was very informative and typical of Adil's passion to help his people. Take care not to get carried away like we did, we spent far money money than we intended to on the Argan products!! This trip is a must do when in Marrakech"

One of the camel guides braided a camel out of grasses for me as were walking and then picked up a baby goat I was admiring to hold. Lunch at a Berber family home was simply perfect. Breathtaking view, delicious food, the family who served us met our every need and a lovely bathroom. Adil dropped us off at the airport in plenty of time to catch our plan.

Sounds a bit dull from the online description, but we were blown away by the scenery in combination with great visits (short enough to maintain interest) and well planned logistics (e.g. pointing out good bathroom stops). The lunch (included in the price) was very fresh and good and served in one of the most stunning locations I've ever lunched in; simple and absolutely fantastic.The guide/driver was very knowledgeable, punctual and pleasant - and a great driver. A big relief. New, clean, safe, comfy car, and although the roads at times are very curvy and somewhat washed away, I didn't even get carsick (which I normally do), as the driving was exceptionally considerate. At no point was there any pushiness to buy anything or give anything to people along the way. If narrow, windy, steep roads scare you, you might want to adjust the route to main roads, which is possible for all but maybe 30-40 minutes of the day's total driving. But do still take this trip!"

Adil was the perfect guide and wonderful company who treated us (me, husband and teenage son) like old friends and my son thought this trip was the best part of our stay in Morocco. The day culminated in lunch at a Berber family's house with delicious food and stunning views of snow capped mountains.

It feels so good knowing you are eating such humble food. All organic and fresh. You eat the soup with a wooden spoon, which is amazing.

From here heading out of the city into the mountains made for a nice change of pace from the city. Adil #2 answered any questions we had. The camel riding is a must do, we stopped at a Berber rug shop on the way into the hills and Adil #2 was brilliant in helping us make a deal in the traditional Berber way. The highlight of the tour for us was the lunch with a view of Toubkal the highest mountain in North Africa. The food was fantastic and the view was beautiful.

We opted for the camel ride because you just have to do it, and even though it was a short ride on a mountain incline, a 2 hour camel tour seems a bit excessive so this was just enough to check off the bucket list item. We didn't get to go to the argan oil cooperative or the market because of the day... but the mountain view panoramic lunch at a Berber house was unforgettable. The food was home cooked and perfectly fresh and delicious and the surroundings were spectacular. The winding ride home through the mountains was breathtaking and Adil felt like more of a friend than tour guide. We look forward to coming back to do it again!"

After reading very dissapointing comments about spending the night in Zagora (commonly known as the night in the Sahara desert), our group of 6 friends went to Atlas Mountains with our lovely guide Adil. The trip started just at the time (9 am) and the first stop was the Berber market, where we spent interesting 30 minutes. After that Adil took us to the Camel ride, which was not very long, but was enough to experience how is the feeling of doing it. After 20 minutes we continued our journey to the Ourika Valley, visit Argan cooperative, where we had a great time not only shopping, but also learning about the process of extracting the oil (they speak english, spanish and french). At 1 pm we had a wonderful lunch at a Berberian house with a great view of the valley. They had a private room for us, very warm, confortable and beautiful. I must say that this trip was awesome, in a very nice Toyota Landcruiser car and with a great and kind guide."

We were picked up from our Riad by Yaya (sorry if that's the wrong spelling!) by a Land Cruiser which was very comfortable. We visited the berber market first which was definitely an eye opener (in a good way), apart from another couple who were on a tour with Adil, we were the only westerners there. It was so interesting, full of colours and sights. Next we drove to the Argan oil cooperative to see how argan oil is made by local women. It really is such a labour intensive process. We got guided around the small \"factory\" by a very informative lady who told us more about it. There was a shop there where you could by all manner of argan oil things. We bought some things (the argan oil dip that tastes like peanut butter - exquisite and some soaps) but we felt that there was no pressure to buy if you didn't want to. We stopped along the way to take photos and stretch our legs. When you go, please take sweets and stationery if you can. The smiles on the kids faces as we gave out thesweets and stationery is a memory I will never forget. So, so grateful for just a pencil or a tiny bag of sweets. Next stop was the Berber house for lunch, overlooking the Atlas mountains. Such an amazing view! The food was so delicious as well, and plentiful - a tagine, cous cous, water and fruit. We learnt how Berbers live and what their homes are like. Our guide was excellent, very considerate and with very good English. He even dropped us off at Jardin Majorelle when we got back into Marrakech. 10/10, we both had an excellent day, please book up!"

We learned about the mountains, the Berber people, the history of the country and the culture. You can happily spend a small fortune buying all the beautiful products on sale at the Argan cooperative, handmade by the lovely local women who are out earning for their families. We were even treated to tea at the colourful roadside cafe by our guide, where he taught us how to make it and why it's so important to pour it from a height! The views. My goodness. You take lunch at the top of the mountains. Freshly prepared by two Berber girls, the tagine was the best we ate in our time in Morocco. Adil has created a magical place, given local people a steady income and tourists an experience of a lifetime. I won't say anymore, it will take away from the surprise. Thank you to all at 4x4 Camel.

We needed some special considerations as our young son gets very car sick. We were picked up promptly at 9am (actually a little earlier even!). Adil speaks great English, French and Arabic. His Toyota Land Cruiser was clean and even equipped with water. We did the 2 valley tour, camel ride and lunch at the Berber village. It was a wonderful day out, gorgeous scenery, friendly guide who was more than willing to stop many times for photographs. Our camel ride was great fun for the kids and lunch in the village was spectacular. Stunning views of the mountains, delicious food and a very authentic and personal experience. We loved every minute of it. Adil does this trip many times a week and has clearly established a very trusting relationship with the various village people. He was greeted warmly everywhere we went and it was heart wrenching to witness a young Berber mother flag him down on the road to show him the X-rays of her ailing husband. Adil took the time to jump out of the vehicle and stop in to visit the sick husband to offer what support he could. He was great with our kids and even took us to the bus station to buy our onward tickets. The $160 GBR while not inexpensive, was worth it for the wonderful experience we had. Highly recommend."

We were expecting to be collected by Adil, as we had booked based on reviews of him, but we were collected by another tour guide named Aziz who was amazing. Very knowledgeable, a real anthropologist! Knew his land so very well.We first visited a Berber Market, then a local Argan Oil Cooperative, then we made it to a beautiful house on a plateau midway up the mountain range and had lunch courtesy of a Berber couple. The lunch was incredible, stunning setting, and the food was delicious!Our tour guide was a Shepherd by trade! He was amazing, he really looked after us and intervened where necessary to stop us being pestered by locals or being ripped off in the market. Look forward to coming back for more tours. HIGHLY RECOMMEND GUYS! Make sure you pick this company for your tours! You are collected at your hotel and returned to your hotel."

We did the camel ride which was the perfect amount of time and enjoyed tea at the end of the ride. We stopped at a shop where Berber carpets are made, a Argan oil shop where they processed argan oil, and a market where they sold delicious dates. Then we made our way up the Atlas mountains. I am very afraid of heights and was having severe anxiety but Adil made me feel comfortable. He handled my fears very well and we stopped to take a few photos. When we made it to the top, it was so beautiful. There was a delicious lunch prepared for us with a beautiful view right in front of us. This tour was absolutely breathtaking and I highly recommend it."

Tripadvisor came up trumps with 4x4 camel and its high recommendations. We both really enjoyed the day and would recommend the day trip to others. I noticed that some day tips with other companies include a visit to some waterfalls, this tour does not include that and the reason is safety. Its re-assuring to know that they are not risking accidents by taking visitors to the waterfalls as the walk and climb to see them is treacherous. Adhil allowed us to take photographs along the route and he was a safe driver. I would rather have a guide show me then to try and navigate the roads myself even though I am a good driver with lots of experience driving abroad. Highly recommended. I have uploaded some images as well to help you see for yourself how stunning the views are."

            "review": "Something very different!. The \"deux vallees\" tour was a great break in our 5 day trip to Marrakech. We were picked up and dropped off at our hotel. On the drive up we stopped at a Berber market, which gives you a real feel for how local people live and interact. Then onto the the camel ride, which my fiancee was hesitant at first but then loved it when we were on the go. Topped off by a complimentary mint tea to warm up at the end. An interesting break was the Argan Oil Co-Op, where you see that they hire divorced women in the local community so they can provide for their children. The oil is manually hard work to produce and rich in Omega 3. It's a worthy cause and we bought a fair bit here as you can really trust the quality of the product as opposed to chancing it in the souks plus you're giving back to the community. Oh and another tip is to buy some pencils, sweets and paper to give to the children on the way. They do not expect it but are happy with small gifts. Then off to the house on the top of the mountain. Unfortunately at the top it was cloudy on our day so we did not get a clear view of the mountain range from the house where we had our meal but it was the best tagine I've had in Marrakech! Plus, Adil was good entertainment value. One of the most valuable parts of the trip was talking to our guide about local knowledge, cultures and customs whilst on the road, which was great. We were even shown Kasbah Tamadot (Richard Branson's luxury hotel) from a distance! on the return journey. All in all a nice day break from Marrakech and worth it in my opinion."

Adil is very friendly and knowledgeable, taught us a lot about Marrakesh, the local Berber people, and Islamic culture in general. We stopped for a brief camel ride which was fun, got some great photos. The best part of the trip by far is the lunch stop at a local house with stunning views and an amazing meal.

The entire day could not have gone better, all the way from booking the tour to its natural conclusion. Adil was highly communicative during the booking process, well spoken, highly customer service oriented and, all in all, runs an A+ company. One of the unexpected surprises was our lunch break, which occurred at a family's home overlooking the breathtaking Atlas Mountains. The meal, cooked by the residents of the home, was outstanding. I have been on many tours and almost alway find the meals to be subpar. That was not the case here. The meal was cooked to perfection and, frankly,, I would have been prepared to pay a considerable amount for such a meal at a restaurant. Even the optional camel ride excursion was wonderful. Adil has a relationship with a wonderful man who owns several camels and, frankly, it was also an unexpected positive surprise. if you travel to Marrakech and are looking for a tour, I strongly recommend you select this company. I know there are many tour company options, but I must strongly recommend that you should choose this company. BTW, I seldom give recommendations, but felt that I needed to share my great experience with you.Rich"

Then regretfully got ill on way to Morocco and had to change everything. Adil was very accommodating and gracious! Our guide was Azziz who was soft spoken, interesting and kind as well. He answered all our questions even the silly ones with no judgement. Also spoke very good English and was more than accommodating on the day trip to 3 valleys we ended up with. My son got car sick and he would stop every time we requested and even help my son himself very kindly! We met Adil on the tour with another group. He was very gracious and we were happy to put a face with a name. This group of tour guides is very professional, kind, informative and give you a 10 star tour! All the previous great reviews are spot on! Highly recommend, they are wonderful people! Very nice SUV's! Best food on our trip so far! Amazing sights, sounds, smells! My family is very grateful!"

We were taken on a private tour with our guide Adil who was very friendly, chatty and happy to talk about everything from Berber life, Moroccan politics, religion, weather and anything else that came up during the day. Part of the trip is through some of the more touristy parts of the Atlas, but Adil makes sure to spend most of the time on lesser travelled and more picturesque roads through the neighbouring valleys.Adil did a great job in combining a whole host of different activities without making it feel rushed or tiring. The final stop at a Berber house for a traditional meal is all about the view; a tasty meal looking across a panoramic landscape with the snow capped peaks of the high Atlas in the background. Breathtaking. Highly recommended."

Everything runs on time, the family that host you are lovely as is the food, and the escape to the mountains for the day is a welcome change.Starting the trip in a local market is a bit strange - imagine a wealthy tour group walking through your local supermarket watching you pic you groceries - however, it does give you a sense of the local life, real people (and an opportunity of your guide to do a bit of personal veg shopping! ;-))The guides will always stop and let you take photos as you go through the Atlas Mountains - it's really relaxed and informative on the way up.DO: take some small packed biscuits or nibbles for the children you meet en route, and stationery. We were not provided with bottles of water, which we were expecting considering the reviews and the amount we paid - it's just a bit of courtesy. So take some of your own. Luckily we had packed some. Don't forget it is altitude too, so if you know your ears are sensitive take some sweets or gum to help with the popping!A visit to the Argan oil Co-Op was nice, the ladies were jovial and used to being 'on show'. They didn't mind. The shop doesn't do a 'hard sell' for you to buy products. People swear by Argan Oil looking at the skin of people in the mountains - but don't forget, the air is cleaner, lifestyle healthier and water purer - so not just the about the miracle nectar! Go up the mountains anywhere and you find milky soft skin! That said, the stuff they produce here is pure and if you know you want to get some you're better off buying it here than some dodgy mix of who knows what in a market, and you're supporting the ladies too.Then on for lunch with on their terrace in the echo and peace of the mountains.A little more of a drive before heading down. There is a marked difference in the effort of attain an dialogue in comparison to going up - the excursion was certainly over, but aways remained polite and professional.The views are spectacular and you are reminded of the beauty and power of mother nature.There are many tour operators. With this one, you do get a good service from online booking and interaction. It's just not consistent between guides, however the intent and aim is very much about giving back to the local people."

The food was exquisite. Adil, the Owner of 4x4 Camel was there to meet and entertain us.

Then on to the Argan oil cooperate where we tasted argan peanut butter and honey. Rather pricey compared to souk's prices but then we knew the money would be going directly to those ladies who we were told are mostly divorced or widowed. The ride to the berber village was a tad long esp with for the kids. My daughter had so much fun giving away chocolate, sweets and crayons to the children we encountered. Habiba made the most delicious chicken tagine we had throughout the trip. Adil No1 and herself explained to me how to make it. Will surely try to replicate it at home. We encountered a slight drizzle on our way down the mountain. The temperature dropped to 19 degrees and was very pleasant.Quite an exhausting day out.

I felt very safe and Adil was providing lots of information but also making conversation with us . I would highly recommend this to others . Also there wasn't very much walking involved and overall a relaxing day out to see this beautiful country . The Berber food was excellent and even my boyfriend who doesn't like vegetables , had eaten his food and had mint tea."

Great stops at a local market and Women's Argan oil co-operative but the best was the stunning mountain scenery and lunch at a Berber village - best tagine of our trip and amazing glimpse of their lifestyle. Adil is a great and informative guide - thoroughly recommend this trip if you are in Marrakech but want to see a bit more of Morocco while you are there."

Firstly Adil our guide was friendly, attentive and filled with lots of wonderful knowledge that opened our eyes to the Moroccan culture. Our favourite part of the tour was eating a meal at a traditional Berber family home. The food was amazing, along with the setting, high in the Atlas Mountains, a truly beautiful and peaceful backdrop to a meal. We also got to see a genuine Argan Oil factory where widows made it all by hand, the Ourika Valley, the highest peak in Morocco and Richard Bransons hotel. One of the most inspiring things however was Adils sense of charity; we regularly stopped to speak to Berber children where Adil had formed relationships via gifts and this was truly heartwarming. 10/10 thoroughly recommend."

Very easy to book through E-mail with Adil no.1. Our guide was Adil no.2 and was very friendly and informative on what we were seeing around us and the local culture. The atlas mountains are a truly remarkable part of the world and the images simply don't do it justice, the marketplace in the village is so much better than that of the on in Jemaa el Fna. It is a must see part of Morocco and you qon't regret it. The guides are fluent in English and I believe French among other languages. They pick you up from your hotel in immaculately kept 4x4's.10/10 from us! Will be booking to do the desert tour when we come back! Thanks for a fantastic and unforgettable day, Craig and Leanne!"

He picked us up in a Toyota Four Runner (new and great condition) with water bottles and a warm smile. Right away, we knew we were in good hands and he made it clear we could ask him any and all questions we had about the Berber Villages and Moroccan Culture. The camel ride was fun even though we felt a bit silly. Make sure to go on a day of the Berber Village market as it is completely different from the Medina. Women, make sure to cover up, I did and I'm glad I did so. Bring cash for the argan oil cooperative and candy for the kids. The lunch we had was delicious and in a beautiful setting over looking the village. The entire experience was authentic and educational. It was so nice to get away from the hustle of Marrakech and see the peaceful lives of the Berber people in the Atlas Mountains.Thanks Abdul!"

            "review": "A day in the Valleys. I spent a day alone with my guide Aziz in his 4x4 exploring the 3 valleys. Aziz himself is a good bloke - I think maybe he was a little tired after coming off 5 days in the desert on another trip - but I enjoyed his company, we had a laugh, he looked after me well and I found him knowledgeable and especially good with the kids we encountered along the way.He collected my from my Riad on time and our first stop was with the camels. I don't think there's a choice in whether you ride the camels or not! These guys make there living from it, so I hopped on and enjoyed 20 minutes of being led around some dirt tracks. My camel seemed well looked after and happy, so that was good. None of the camels were linked together or badly treated from what I could see.After that the market - or Facebook for Berbers as my guide explained, as it's the social hub to hang out. The market was culturally fascinating, particularly when I learned that the hairdressers also pull teeth... healthcare is expensive and unaffordable for many, which is a big problem for the country. It was evident that people have a tough life in the valleys. I had a good time chatting with the ladies at the Argan oil co-operative. I think one of them wanted me to marry their daughter... The work of making the oil looks painfully laborious - I had a go and after 5 minutes I was knackered. I did buy some oil, which to be honest I thought was expensive, but if it helps the lovely ladies then I'm happy to take a hit in my wallet for them. Only recently in Morocco women can divorce their husbands... so unsurprisingly we came upon many women's co-operatives involving argan oil. The rest of the trip was very scenic and the tagine lunch I had in the home was unforgettable - one of the best lunch experiences I've had to be honest. But here is the most important tip I can give you for the trip - BRING LOTS OF STUFF FOR THE KIDS.I had already brought quite a lot with me - pens, sweets, note pads - and I thought we'd just come across one small group of children, but no, we must have come across at least 5 groups of kids on the roads and towards the end I was running out of stuff to give fast. Perhaps on one hand it's not good that they rely on hand-outs from tourist... but when you see how little there is around the valleys and how hard life is, you wish you'd brought a truck of toys and school equipment. So take lots of individual gifts to share out and spread some joy.Thanks 4x4 and especially Aziz for an unforgettable day. Keep up the good work and I look forward to going to the desert with you one day."

No question that the reviews SEEM to suggest that this is an amazing experience and all we can add here is that the comments on TripAdvisor are very accurate indeed.We spent 7 days in Morocco at a supposedly 5* resort and booked various trips through the hotel. This tour was not one that was recommended by the hotel. In fact we booked it from a recommendation by a friend and we were very glad we did.Overall, the tour blew away anything we booked through the hotels 'recommended' tours. Our guide Aziz, was fantastic and informative throughout the day. The tour of the mountains, the camel ride, Berber museum, the Argan oil factory and the lunch with in the Berber family in the village was all perfect. Even the car was comfortable and spacious. Not something that is a given when booking a trip in Morocco!The best value trip we ever had, even if it was twice the amount we paid we would have recommended this trip to anyone.FANTASTIC. A must for anyone wanting some of the culture and amazing views.If we could give you guys 6 stars we would have.........In fact TripAdvisor should adjust the ratings to take you into account. 5 stars just are not enough!!!!My advice.....ignore the hotels recommendations and book this. In fact, book anything these guys arrange. The best......A+++++++++++++++"

Took us to the 4x4 vehicle (Mitsubishi Shogun) parked around the corner, which was very comfortable and clean. We spent all day with Yahya who spoke excellent English and was very knowledgeable with regards to the history, culture and current affairs of Marrakech. For lunch he took us to a traditional Berber house which was delicious, all organic and fresh. Lovely tomato and red onion salad with a traditional chicken tagine. We also had a stop at the female co-operative Argan oil factory. The mountains were beautiful and very scenic. We would definitely recommend to use 4x4 Camel for a tour of the mountains, they were very professional, friendly and knowledgeable. A great day out!"

The atlas is.gorgeous and you should never fall asleep after lunch like a lot of people do because it's a blessing to look at such beautiful scenery. It's also very cool to be picked up and dropped off at our riad .

My friend and I booked for the day tour of the Atlas Mountains and were shown around by Adil no.2.The trip was lovely, Adil is very knowledgeable about the area and is great company for the day. He knew all of the best spots for photos etc. The lunch was beautiful. Quite probably the best meal of our holiday. What we loved most about the day was a bit or respite from all of the bartering. It was very relaxing and allowed us to enjoy the beautiful scenery. Whilst Adil did take us to a range of places; tea by the river; the argon oil ladies; a pottery and carpet shop, we did not feel the need to buy anything. We did make purchases, but at no point did we feel pressure to. We also had a camel ride as part of our tour. This was, as some people had previously said, a little touristy. However that is to be expected and is pretty unavoidable. It was in a lovely area and was great fun. Would defiantly recommend it.We organised the trip with a couple of days notice via email with Adil whilst we were in Marrakech. It was very quick and easy to plan and payment was taken right at the end of the day when we were dropped back to our hotel.Overall, we would both highly recommend this. It shows a different side to Morocco which you don't see in central Marrakech. Great value for money, very easy to organise, incredibly relaxing and the highlight of the holiday!"

            "review": "Really worth it. First of all, I would really recommend this tour. It is a fairly basic tour apparently, what Moroccans call \"of the 3 valleys\" as I was told, but if you have never been outside of Marrakech or if this is your first time there, you should definitely do it.Our guide was waiting for us at our hotel reception, he was very punctual and courteous. He introduced himself, we went to his car and drove off. He immediately starts telling you all about the history of Marrakech (in French or English, whatever you prefer) and you have a nice conversation with him along the way.We then arrived at the Berber market, which is truly authentic. We were two girls dressed in shorts and t-shirt (we would have made an effort out of respect, but it was 50\u00b0C for Pete's sake) and were repeatedly groped. To be fair, I think this place really opened our eyes on the reality of these people's lives and we were too dumbfounded to think about going towards some of them to talk, which I really regret, since I am sure our guide would have happily helped us translate. We did get treated to some very juicy Indian figs. And I have to say, discretion is advised for animal lovers.We then went to the camels. The guide there is really nice and will happily talk to you during the ride, take photos and videos of you on the camel. He also treated us to some more Indian figs, without forgetting to give one to our camel. This said.... my friend's camel was tied rather closely to mine's rear (you can see it on some of the pictures); he couldn't move like he wanted to. My friend was actually afraid her camel would trip because he couldn\u2019t see a thing and had to follow my camel blindly... I tried googling about camel rides in Morocco before going (having been quite shocked by the living conditions of elephants tortured into being tourist attractions in India), but didn't find anything. So I'm still not sure whether these animals are being treated fairly or not, as my question about their welfare was waived off with a laugh and I didn't dare to ask more...After a nice cup of tea, we were back on the road, going up in the mountains, to the women-run Argan Oil Cooperative. The production site in itself is interesting, seeing these women work so hard. Yes, as someone said in his review, the products aren\u2019t cheap, but they are unique and when you see all they go through to obtain just a drop of it, you\u2019ll understand why it\u2019s pricy! After visiting the \u2018factory\u2019 (6 women sitting on the floor in a barn, using primitive tools and their bare hands), you\u2019ll be led to the shop where they\u2019ll repeatedly tell you there is no purchase obligation. We absolutely didn\u2019t feel pressured into buying anything, but I dare you not to after tasting it! We were then treated to a nice cup of tea along the river, a very peaceful and beautiful place to be, I wouldn\u2019t have objected to spending some more time there.There we go again, to the home of a Berber family, where we would also have our lunch. This was magnificent. I am glad some families are able to make a living welcoming tourists in their homes and serving them their delicious food. After a visit of the house (their living room and hammam are worth seeing and you can admire the tagines cooking, the smell will make you drool), our starter was served on the roof terrace with a superb view of the Atlas. We started with a Moroccan salad, followed by no less than two mains, comprised of a tagine and a couscous. We also got fresh water and tea with dessert.After our guide bought some sweets for the local children, we were off again, back to Marrakech, with some nice breaks to admire the view and take pictures.All in all, some aspects could be improved (being more integrated in the market life, having more info on the camels\u2019 wellbeing, maybe participate a bit in the production of Argan oil), and it is certainly difficult to offer a package including activities that would satisfy everyone. At \u20ac75 per person and \u20ac10 per person for the camel ride, I would certainly recommend it, if only to escape Marrakesh for one peaceful day in the mountains!"

You really get a little bit of everything on this tour. We went through the Atlas mountains driving through and stopping in Berber villages, we saw Kasbahs, palm groves, gorges and finally we rode on a camel in the Sahara, watched the sun set and camped in a Berber tent. It was an amazing experience, one I will never forget. Be aware that there are two desert trips on offer in Morocco but 4x4 camel offer the only one that is officailly part of the Sahara, the Erg Chebbi dunes. It is breathtaking. This was a private tour with just me, my husband and our driver/guide Adil in a 4x4. As is usual on tours like this you do stop at pre-arranged places where you can have a demonstration by local people on how they make Argan oil or rose water and then you can opt to buy some if you wish. I know that people can get annoyed with things like this sometimes but this is a way of ensuring that local people in the villages that you pass through benefit from tourism in some way. I never felt pressured to buy anything and found the pit stops welcome and enjoyable.We took pens, pencils, notepads and swetts with us and asked Adil to stop whenever he saw children walking though the mountains and I would recommend that you do this is possible as they really appreciate things like this in the remote villages. If you cannot bring anything with you it is easy to buy things like this in the Souks.Our first night's accommodation was absolutely perfect. The owner could not do enough for us, the room was beautiful and so spacious and there was a lovely terrace with views of the palm groves along with a pool. The second night's accommodation was a tent but it had a shower and toilet with a really comfortable bed in such a lovely setting and the night's food and entertainment were superb although we were completely shattered after all the camel riding! Be aware that when you are given the option to either go back to camp after the sunset on your camel or take the 4x4 back you will be on that camel for close to an hour in the pitch black. It was an unforgettable experience as the sky is so clear and your eyes play tricks on you in the dark which is fun but I could barely walk afterwards!All in all an amazing, unforgettable, once in a lifetime experience that is definitely worth the time and money if you can spare both. Thank you Adil!"

This tour will take you high into the Atlas mountains, showing you the variations in the environment and a bit of Berber village life; great if you're a rock/geology enthusiast, as you get a tour of the different levels of the mountains and their makeup!The guides are fun and friendly, and give you lots of information, and really philanthropic as they encourage you to bring stationary to give to the local children of the villages you pass in the mountains.A 20 minute camel ride is also available for an extra 100dirhams (10euros).The tour also takes you to visit a cooperative argan oil factory, run by women who are either widowed or divorced. You see their product being made and can buy directly from their store. While it's quite expensive, it's worth spending the money here if you have it, as the profits are shared between the women who work there. Lunch is included and is prepared by a family in one of the villages, traditional moroccan salad, tagine and couscous.This was the best meal we had! Compliments to the chefs. A part of the money also goes to this family :).Be prepared if you are prone to travel sickness as the mountain roads are pretty winding, especially higher up. I got pretty ill which dampened the experience for me. Travel sickness pills advised!We did the tour as a couple and had a great time, but I would also recommend it for groups or friends, or families with older children (not great for young kids, as there is a lot of sitting in the car). Thanks for Yahyah and Adil for an awesome experience!! :)"

We really can't thank Adil enough for organising the trip and for Yaya who was such a friendly informative lovely guide, a real stalwart. I urge you to book this marvellous experience and really experience Marrakech! Before I commence this review when you do book try to pack some sweets or small tours or stationery for the Berber children as the joy on their faces is indescribable as they have so little.Our journey started when Yaya collected us from our hotel the Eden Andalou in his lovely air conditioned 4x4. He is such a thoughtful man, even stopping to buy us soft drinks.He took us to a traditional Berber market first, don't expect to buy souvenirs , but you will find luscious fruit, dried dates and figs that we don't see back home, meat fish a whole plethora of items used by the community, a medieval market so to speak. Barbers, iron workers, as well as grocers. Please note however this is not a typical tourist attraction and the market traders are not overtly keen on being photographed . The produce is not only fresh and wholesome but so remark lay cheap too.Next we went on to what made this our favourite trip ever the camel rides! I opted for Shakira a gentle camel with beautiful eyes, my hubsnd's camel was called Armenia . We were helped on to these lovely creatures and deli gently led about a mile or so on a path through the Andes by a thou roughly limbless young camel herd dressed in colourful traditional costume. Such wonderful staff keen throughout to reassure us (this was our first ever camel ride) and put our needs and comfort foremost, marvellous!Then we went to the Berber village high up in the Andes, where Yaya showed us his favourite spot to contemplate where you could heat children playing in the next village. Everything so thoroughly and thoughtfully organised to ensure that we had a memorable experience, and made the most of our day,again I commend this marvellous company.The Berber householders were very welcoming and we enjoyed our wonderfully delicious lunch of freshly baked bread and tomato salad, chicken tangible ( the chicken was raised on the farm) and finally refreshing melon and soothing mint tea poured by the elder daughter of the household.the Berbers we met were so gentle and hospitable.Finally we were taken to the women's Agranulocytosis oil commune where I sat with the woen and hand milled the agranulocytosis nuts to produce a sticky agran paste, it was such a privilege to experience their lives for just a little while. Our guide wad informative and welcomed our questions. The gist shop is a must for agranu oil, elegant agran soap sets, handmade bags and cosmetics and you know that any monies spent are going to help the community remain self sufficient.The memory of Berber children will remain with me as I mentioned before they were so great flu for our small gifts and so likeable .The landscape we past with rushing rivers, semi Deseret, cacti, the very -Andes mountains are so breathtakingly beautiful but to do it justice you must see it.Although this has been a lengthy review, I really hope to have encapsulated our exhilarating day. Once again heartfelt thanks to Adil and Yaya we wish you continued success we can't wait to book more tours with you when we wet run to Marrakech."

            "review": "Fantastic day trip. I can only echo all the other wonderful reviews on here. I did this day trip with my 17yr old daughter and we both had the best day of our 4 day break. Our guide for the day was Abdullah and he was lovely. Turned up 10 minutes early, spoke brilliant English and was a knowledgeable, friendly, funny guide. He was very open about his family and faith during Ramadan too which was very interesting and we really enjoyed his company. The trip as everyone says is just brilliant. The views, the lunch, the camel ride, the women's cooperative, the market all so interesting and worthwhile. You really feel like you have done loads in one day but it doesn't feel rushed either. I was disappointed we didn't see more children (not the tours fault!) as I had taken a suitcase full of clothes and school supplies. The children we did see however were so grateful and delighted with whatever you gave them it made us feel rather humble & emotional. Our guide said he would take all the clothes and school supplies left over to a women's cooperative for us and I have no reason to doubt that he did as he seemed like a very genuine, honest person. We had such a wonderful day and I plan to return to Morocco next April - I will definitely be doing another private tour with this company as the professionalism and overall experience was outstanding."

            "review": "Absolutely BRILLIANT! Best part of our holiday!. The reviews don't lie - this is the absolute best day out. Our host, Abdullah, was great - he drove us around all day and ensured everything was perfect for us. The camel riding was terrific - short but enough! The meal was just as amazing as everyone says it was, and the argan oil co-operative was eye-opening. (Of course we bought tons - feels good to contribute, though!) Abdullah let us stop whenever we wanted to take photos, and even stopped by a roadside market in the end to buy us probably the freshest peaches we've ever eaten.This day trip was such incredible value and the absolute highlight of our time in Morocco. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I wouldn't hesitate!"

            "review": "Cool off in the summer ... head to the mountains!. We had an amazing day trip to the mountains with 4x4 camel. All communications via email were handled promptly & professionally. Our guide arrived at our Riad in the middle of the medina on time and led us our to a nicely air conditioned Toyota 4x4 (Land Cruiser?). The 4x4 part is important ... when we crossed on the high road from one valley to the next, it came into play! We enjoyed especially handing out school supplies to the children who came running from the villages along the high road when they heard the car .. make sure you bring some! It seemed as though our guide really enjoyed this part of his job as well. The weekly market that we visited was just what you would expect a market to be - what appears to be chaos & confusion is simply commerce taking place. Fascinating! We also had a wonderful traditional tangine lunch in a Berber home in one of the mountain villages - the home of the imam from the local mosque. The trip was one of our best days in Morocco, and the cool weather in July in the mountains was a refreshing break from the heat in Marrakech."

            "review": "Amazing day, loved loved loved it!. From my first email with Adil he was so helpful, and he speaks perfect English which was very helpful. We were collected promptly by our guide Aziz from our hotel, Aziz also spoke fabulous english and was so knowledgable about the areas we visited, and answered all the questions we had. It was only my sister and I on the tour as all the tours are private, and we felt completely comfortable with Aziz. The valleys are so beautiful words just cannot describe, and pictures do not do them justice. The camels are well cared for, in good condition, which for me was important, and the camel guides are very helpful answering all our questions. The argan oil cooperative is a great place, and the products are amazing, the labour involved to make the oil is insane, so the products are not cheap, but they really are woth every penny! Our guide there was very informative and helpful, and not at all pushy. Tea by the river was refreshing and theres a lovely breeze in the mountains. The food with the Berber family is by far the best food I've ever had, absolutely amazing! The children in the valleys were very grateful for the pens we took, and all very politely said thank you. Overall an absolutely amazing experience, very humblng, interesting and worth every penny! Thank you so much to Aziz for a fabulous day and to Adil for organising it. If you are considering this trip, do not think twice! It's AMAZING!"

On the way up to the mountains the children come to the side of the road to greet you as they see the car coming up. It was recommended in one of the previous reviews to take colouring books and crayons with you to hand out to the children and I'm so glad we did, they were so sweet and happy. Our guide yayer was great, we stopped at a small market on the way and he helped me buy the right green tea for Moroccan mint tea! He was a fantastic guide and very knowledgeable! The argan oil was a great experience and while we were there we bought some of the argan oil peanut butter mmm! And some amber, wow - that smell is amazing (and is burning in my home now)! The meal that you have at the last stop of the tour is guaranteed to be the best food you will eat during your stay. And the portions are so big..i was a very happy girl! Really enjoyed this tour. Thank you."

What a fabulous day, we booked last minute after reading the reviews on trip advisor and they are so rightWe were collected at the agreed time, from our hotel, our driver who was also our guide spoke excellent English and was knowledgeable, entertaining and interesting, he spoke just the right amount.All the places visited were very interesting the oil co-operative was good and we bought some really good oil, there is no pressure to do so, but it was so good very hard to resistThe mountains were amazing, and the views spectacular, but I would warn that it's not for the faint hearted, I swapped seats with my daughter's boyfriend as the edges were a little much for me, I did however feel very safe, and was always driven with care, anyway what can you expect, its a mountain trip bound to be edges!!!Then the lunch in the village house was so good, the best meal we have ever had in Morocco, and the family so generous to allow us to come into their home and cook for us it topped off a great dayI would recommend this trip to all, great value for money"

We were picked up by our lovely tour guide on time & driven round in a clean, comfy land cruiser. We did a 20 minute camel ride which was great & the staff were lovely. We then drove further into the Atlas Mountains & visited the Argan Oil Co-operative. Our guide treated us to some mint tea by the river after this then it was straight back in the car to drive through the many different valleys to a small Berber village where we stopped for lunch in a family home. The family & the food they cooked for us was exceptional. We could not fault this trip what so ever. Our guide was so nice & very informative. I'd also recommend this to a group of girls, you would feel safe & comfortable. 5 stars !!!!"

You really see a lot in one day and the experience is unforgettable. We were picked up shortly after 9am and on our way. Our guide was very friendly, knowledgeable and a pleasure to spend time with. Our first stop was the market just outside Marrakech and it really was something to see. They sell everything you can imagine there. We probably could have spent hours just at the market alone. From there we ventured out into the valley for our camel ride (approx 20 minutes). The camel ride as so much fun! We then went to the Argan Oil Cooperative - such a wonderful experience. I had a great time with the ladies working there. They were in good spirits and a lot of fun. We got our try at breaking the nuts (first step in making the Argan oil). Then we went further up the mountains and towards Berber Village for our traditional Moroccan lunch. The lunch was delicious and such a beautiful setting to eat in! The traditional home was interesting to see and a nice place to stop. Well worth the price!***** If you can, bring items to donate as there's a ton of children in need. Clothes, school supplies and treats would be much appreciated! We brought a suitcase full of items to donate and still ran out."

            "review": "Berber Village and Atlas mountain day tour. Myself and my boyfriend were looking to book a last minute day tour. We found Adil on TripAdvisor and saw all the great reviews he had (all of which are absolutely correct) We e-mailed him about organising a tour and he responded very quickly even arranging a tour for us the very next day. Adil picked us up from our hotel and and from the start he was friendly and enthusiastic. As this was our first time in Morrocco he asked had we seen the sites near our hotel. One in particular was the Jardin De Majourelle. This was not in the plan for the day tour but Adil was more than happy to make a stop and allow us some time to have a look around. From there we began our journey to the Atlas mountains. Along the way Adil gave us lots of information and some history of Morroco. He was more than happy to stop at any location to let us take photos. We stopped at one site on the way and he warned us before we got out that we would be approached by locals trying to sell us their goods. This turned out to be very true! Adil was quick to step in when they became more \"enthusiastic\" their selling. It was great to have a guide in situations like this as we found it a little hard to communicate. The drive was lovely. Our first stop was the Berber village. Here we visited a traditional Berber home and met the women who lived there. We got a chance to sample their home made mint tea and natural honey. ... It was amazing! We were given time to take some pictures and look around. We then went to see the women's co-operat8ve in the same village. Our journey continued into the Atlas mountains. Here we were handed over to Jamal, a local guide. His English was perfect and he was very plesent. He allowed us as much time as went wanted to walk around, take photos and even go swimming under the waterfall. Lunch was included in the tour price. We sat in a lovely restaurant in the river. We had a traditional Morrocan meal (which was lovely!) and all drinks were covered too. Again we had as much time as we liked there. I cannot recommend Adil enough. He was professional yet very friendly. We had a great day and would certainly advise anyone who is looking to do a tour to book with Adil. Not only did he provide us with a great day tour we also had to arrange transport to the airport as we felt our original transfer was going to be too late. We contacted Adil last minute and he was more than happy to accommodate us. Again his service was excellent, even helping bring our bags to the terminal and making sure we knew where we were going. 10/10 for service!! Highly recommended!"

            "review": "Best day of our hol. The best decision for our visit to Morocco was to book this trip to the Atlas Mountains. Adil 2 picked us up from the hotel and spoke excellent English. He firstly took us to a traditional Berber market which was completely different to the souks and medina with no hassle. The butchers section was an eye opening experience. On the way there Adil 2 gave us so much information about Morocco and an insight into life there. Next we took a camel ride around the mountains which was so peaceful and picturesque. We went on to the cooperative and spent a small fortune on argan oil products however we know the money is going straight to the workers so we did not begrudge this at all. We had mint tea in a beautiful location and went higher up the mountains to the Berber house for lunch. As all other reviews have said- this was the best meal of our trip and cooked to perfection with beautiful views. Glad we took sweets for the children who were waiting by the roadsides. Nice that something so small can put s smile on their faces. As we were 2 young females we would like to mention we felt incredibly safe with Adil 2 and there is a reason for the high ratings of these tours. I just wished we had booked this one earlier so we could then book the Sahara tour too which sounds amazing. We would love to do this on a return trip."

Firstly before I even go into the review I'm just gonna say, book it..just do it! You will not be disappointed& Abdallah was the best!Firstly booking this was very easy through email conversations and Adil was very helpful. Ok so a friend and I went on this cruise tour up the Altlas mountain with Abdallah. He picked us up from our hotel which was a little out of the centre with no problem at 9am on the dot. We made our way on the cruise in a lovely 4x4 which gave a really nice feel to the tour instead of a crappy van lol. Being a private tour, you can't really go wrong, our tour guide just went with the flow, if we wanted to stop and take pictures, put the air con on, drink some tea it's your call which was nice. The views up to the mountain was unreal and so beautiful. We got to see the Berber markets, camel ride, the argan oil company and buy some oil (hair feels amazing btw), all breathtaking views up to the mountain, traditional Berber lunch was very tasty and the rooftop mountain view was beautiful! Lunch being the peak of the tour I'd say even going down the mountain was gorgeous - you obviously take another route so the beautiful views keep on coming. I loved that Abdallah also let us walk for a bit whilst he drove off a little further so we could really take in the view, really good touch! The tour took the whole day and I tell you know, day well spent!! If you're wondering, you pay for the tour at the end when you reach your hotel. I'd maybe recommend booking this tour earlier on in your holiday - we did this and found was a good idea as we could then arrange pool days and city adventures after.I must say our tour driver Abdallah was amesome! The atmosphere in the car was really chilled and we had some good conversations - 100% added to the experience! Thanks Abdallah and Adil!! 10/10 - booooook it!"

We headed out of Marrakech in a comfy LandRover (with A/C) and visited a locals-only fresh market. Aziz was fantastic, super knowledgeable and fun, sharing tons of stories and history with us and giving us real insight into Moroccan life. After the market, we headed towards the Atlas Mountains, and stopped for a camel ride through the gorgeous, lush countryside, with rolling hills around us, the mountains as our amazing backdrop. Then we off-roaded up the mountains and headed to a women's Argan oil cooperative, where we got to meet the ladies, watch them in their processes and were able to buy some products before we left. Stopped for some yummy mint tea beside a beautiful brook, then headed up the mountains through the Berber villages. Absolutely beautiful scenery, it was spectacular, we practically touched the clouds. Stopped for lunch at a local Berber family home and had some of the best meals ever. The entire experience was magical and Aziz was just wonderful, showing us Morocco like we never imagined. We emphatically recommend this tour for really seeing the beauty of the Moroccan countryside, its locals and its majestic mountains."

We didn't want a 'coach style' trip so opted for a day trip of the Two Valleys and Berber life and we had the best time. Personally collected from our Riad, our private tour guide Adil was friendly and very knowledgeable of the areas we visited. Our first stop was a true Berber market to experience the weekly shopping, which I found fascinating and we were treated to a taster of slow cooked goat and mint tea. As females, this was not the norm however we were warmly welcomed. Moving onto an optional camel ride, which was very funny then onto the Argan Oil Cooperative were a guide told us how they made their products, there wasn't any pressure to buy if you didn't want to. Now to travel through the valleys and meet the local children........a tip to take with you pencils, books, notepads and sweets to handout for the kids. Lunch was a feast of tomato salad, bread, chicken tagine, couscous and fresh fruit! Before traveling back to Marrakesh though the second valley. I highly recommend this trip for a more personal insight to local Berber life."

My wife and I learnt of this tour from a couple who shared our Riad, upon returning from the trip they were extremely enthusiastic, we then enquired via email with Adil if it was possible to undertake a tour within our 6 days in Marrakech and he was able to offer a suitable day by responding very quickly and clearly.We were collected from the Riad exactly on time and enjoyed not only a full day tour, which included, 20 min camel ride, Berber market, women's cooperative argan oil workshop, cafe stop in a mountain river location and lunch in a berber family home.Adil's knowledge and love of his country is clear, with his knowledge passed on throughout the day by pleasant and friendly conversation.At all stops throughout the day we were made to feel very welcome and it is clear that Adil's company are very well respected by the hosts, making us as guests feel very welcome also.The true surprise for us came from the support which Adil gives the local Berber community especially helping the children. We took simple children's reading books to give to children and some sweets, of course and took great pleasure in seeing real appreciation from the children. Adil helps with nursery education in the mountains and it is clear helps wherever he can. We even gave a young boy a football on the mountain road and enjoyed an impromptu game of football !After a few days in the medina this tour was a real tonic and provided wonderful scenery, great food and a warm glow inside.Well done Adil and colleaguesGreg and Becky, Bath, UK"

It's hard to put in to words just how great a day we had on the 4x4 Atlas Mountains tour, but if you are considering (which we definitely recommend) let us talk you through some of our highlights:- we were conveniently picked up from the front of our hotel at 9am by the charming Aziz - he immediately made us feel comfortable and spoke brilliant English- the car was great, really high quality, felt Very safe and a nice touch when we were both offered a bottle of water- we were driven to a relatively rural area where locals were working the fields and were offered the opportunity to ride a camel - we did not feel pressured to take this up in anyway but it was great - the scenery was stunning and our guide was very entertaining- from here we were driven to a local Berber market and Aziz gave us a tour around - there were some really interesting things on sale! It was great to see locals going about their day to day business- after this we were driven around the Ourika valley - visually stunning and very peaceful - we had the chance to take a few photos of the surrounding mountains and Aziz had no problem stopping for us to get a good shot- next we visited the Argan Oil Co-operative where women (either divorced or widowed) are given the chance to live an independent life through the hand made production of Argan Oil - we were given a guided tour of the facility and sampled a variety of products (some of which we bought) - it felt great to support this initiative- after this we had lunch at a traditional Berber home - this was brilliant and quite possibly the best meal we've had in Marrakech!! - from here we were driven back towards our hotel via the stunning Asni valley, with great commentary from Aziz as always!Overall an absolutely brilliant day - can't recommend highly enough and we would definitely use their services again on a return trip to Marrakech!!"

Email responses from Adil when booking the tour from the UK were speedy and helpful. Ahmed/yehyeh was our guide and careful driver, quietly spoken with a relaxed manner picked us up from the Sofitel on time.The market visit was like a scene from James Bond - nothing touristy here - the real deal. Spent more than I bargained for at the women's co-operative because the goods on sale were amazing. Had (free) herbal tea in a random outdoor cafe in a river bed. Lunch - which we were all a bit wary of for reasons unknown - was fantastic. A rare opportunity to eat a generous and very good tagine home cooked on a rooftop area with a Berber family, overlooking a beautiful valley - truly memorable. We asked Adil in advance what the Berber children would like as gifts and as a result took gloves, pens and paper, which were gratefully received. The charitable side of Adil's operation is admirable. Tips - You need to take Euros to pay at the end of the day; wear stout shoes and take layers of clothing; take water, take your camera - if you can take panoramic shots, so much the better. 100% deserving of longstanding top place on TripAdvisor."

I was a bit concerned about it being just my friend and I (two 22 year old girls) going up into the mountains and it not being a group tour... But i am so glad we went for it!Not only was Adil quick to respond to my initial email, but he was very helpful in negotiating the best day to suit us... being taken to the Berber Market that only happened on a Monday (where Adil knew the locals making us feel very safe).He was a humerus fountain of knowledge and a joy to spend the day with! (bottle of water provided for us both) He was happy skip some parts of the trip if it was not of interest to you and also to spend more time in certain places if you so wished!Along the way we stopped at the Berber family house up in the mountains where Adil's colleagues and their explorers joined for the most incredible traditional lunch on a beautiful terrace looking over the mountains.Adil is very passionate about his country and about sharing his knowledge with everyone, i learnt a lot, saw some beautiful things and had a great laugh along the way!At no point did i feel uncomfortable... which i was concerned about (being two young girls). We had explained to Adil during our trip how we had struggled to find good places to eat in the evening... so on our way back to the hotel Adil kindly took a slight detour to point out some good local traditional restaurants. He even refused our tip at the end of the journey... because he is such a lovely honest guy!I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND ADIL'S TOURS TO EVERYONE! (optional camel ride well worth doing...PERFECT... only 20mins across the mountains and the camels didn't spit or smell!!!)Had a fantastic day... and next time ill do the Sahara Tour!Thanks Adil, for a great day and your kindness!"

Both of us gulped quietly a little concerned being in the car all day with him.However, the conversation flowed, I was sneezing big style and we then realised that\" high fever\" was thankfully hay fever!What an interesting and thought provoking day. The local market was really interesting with a little fun at the barber/dentist along the way.The veg and fruit looked fresh and especially some of the meat killed before your eyes..not for the faint hearted.Onwards into the mountains passing through the villages and giving gifts of pens/paper to the sweet appreciative children along the way. Be warned.. Save some for the chidren in the higher villages. We'd run out by the time we got to them and felt awful.Loved the 20min camel ride..

Aziz was a wonderful guide - so full of information as well as being friendly and a very careful driver - especially important on those mountain roads. We stopped for a camel ride which was eventful and a great photo opportunity - then visited an argan oil co-operative, drank delicious mint tea by a bubbling brook and drove through stunning mountainous countryside to a traditional Berber house for lunch - sat cross legged on the shady roof terrace - and ate the most delicious home made bread, tomato and coriander salad, chicken tagine, fruit and mint tea. Make sure you take some sweets, tooth brushes, stationary etc and any spare winter clothes for the beautiful local children - it gets very cold in the mountains in the winter and they lead a tough life - but are very grateful for anything you may have brought out with you. There was snow on the mountains and Aziz was full of really interesting information such as pointing out the village Brad Pitt had provided electricity for and 'Brad's Pylon'! We would love to do a longer tour next time - camping under the stars in a tent and visiting the village known as the 'Hollywood of Marrakech' where many of the blockbuster movies have been filmed. If you have more than 3 days in Marrakech we would highly recommend this tour and company - especially Aziz our driver. It added another whole dimension to our trip to Marrakech."

We skipped the camels having done before but the market was really interesting. I bought beans to plant in my garden so cheap! We had a superb meal in the imans house, the best tangine all our time in morroco. Aziz was a great guide, careful driver and humorous. Its so bumpy in the hills and he says you get a berber massage! Thanks guys really left lots of memories"

            "review": "The best way to experience the REAL Atlas Mountains.... We booked the Deux Vallees tour of the Atlas mountains based on the Trip Advisor reviews and we were not disappointed. Adil (there are 3 but we got number 1), from the moment he picked us up at the hotel, to dropping us off, treated us like new friends that he wanted to share his passion for his country, his and the Berber community way of life, his family philosophy with. He succeeded, and did it with class and quality. We had a ball just talking about life.Back to the tour, the Berber market was interesting, especially the Berber physiotherapist/homeopath/masseur/osteopath/healer and his techniques and it was nice to take photos of all the food and produce with no hassles.We stopped at a caf\u00e9 besides a raging river and over a Mint tea discussed education and children before heading off into the mountains. The views were fantastic and we had great weather, stopping frequently for photos, and even had a 30 minute walk after our \"massage\" (Adil's definition of our time in the 4 wheel drive over fairly rough ground) which allowed us to soak in the colours and peacefulness.On the way to the Berber village for lunch we did the school run where we gave the kids pencils and paper etc. and the delight of their faces was priceless. The Berbers, young and old exude a real gentleness that just makes you want to relax.The meal at the family house was fantastic, the best Moroccan food we had in Morocco, and a real highlight of the trip, and we met two other couples on the same tour, with Adil (1)'s team driving them around. All of us were in unison about our opportunity to have this unique experience (we all said we would recommend this to our friends).My wife was impressed with the toilet, from a cleanliness perspective but she struggled with her English sensibilities in getting the job done ! :) (I am Australian, we are open about these sort of things!). All new experiences are good experiences. We recommend this trip to everyone, you will have a great time."

Adil no 2 (there is 2 Adil's) took my wife and I on a day trip to Atlas mountains. The whole trip is well thought out and really interacts with the local community. We drove in a Toyota Prado Land Cruiser just the 3 of us so it was very intimate and you can ask Adil anything about Morocco (and life...haha). Was amazing to have traditional dishes at the Berber house high up in the mountains. We were a bit unlucky with the weather as it was very misty and we could not see much...my friend went a couple of months before me with same guide and i saw his pictures which was breathtaking....i could only imagine what was before me. Adil was kind enough to stretch the tour a bit so we drove a different route back to Marrakech to see as much possible at a bit lower altiture (under the mist and fog). This just shows how much they are willing to go out of their way to make the trip enjoyable.Defnitely worth it and an eye opener into the lives of the Berber people in Morocco."

The stunning scenery, humbling people, and excellent company combined to make this a truly memorable day. Highly recommended."

Ask him about his family and history, so interesting! We began the tour visiting the Berber market. It was a bit intimidating to begin with as it was very very busy, animals everywhere. But it became very clear that everyone is very kind and fun! We had a few pics with the sellers, it was great. The meat section was very interesting indeed, that's all I'll say!Next we had a camel ride. For \u20ac10 extra each, it was a brilliant. We then went to the argon oil co-operative. We loved seeing how the women make the oil. We bought some olive oil, face cream and a few other bits from the shop. Finally we had lunch at a families home in a Berber village. It was the best tagine and couscous we had in the whole of our stay! The view from the terrace was incredible. The whole trip was absolutely incredible. Aziz would stop anywhere we wanted him to to take pictures. He gave us lots of interesting information about the different Berber villages. We had forgotten to bring the supplies we bought for the Berber children so he helped us buy some sweets from the market. All in all, this is absolutely worth your money. We stayed in marrakech for ten days and this was our favourite, most memorable and most talked about! We highly recommend."

The two Adils and their partners have created something very special with this company. Adil knows everyone along the route through the mountains and around the Berber villages. The sights were amazing, but it was the people we met that made this such a memorable day out. This company is helping local people by hiring them to invite tourists into their homes for a meal; in return, the villagers are expected to, as Adil put it, \"show an amelioration in their lives.\" For example, the eldest boy in the family with whom we ate is now studying in university. Adil hopes he will become a leader of some kind in his Berber community. A perfect, thought-provoking, humbling, memorable experience. Highly, highly recommended."

I could've done without the argan oil cooperative, but it was interesting to learn the process nonetheless. For someone who struggles with the desert heat, the escape to the mountains was a welcome chance to cool off and see a more authentic side of Morocco than the bustle of Marrakech.

We did the one day tour,on march 30th, Adil picked us up at our hotel Naoura Barriere in Marrakech at 9am and brought us back a little after 4pm.He was super nice and acomodating, i asked for him to be our guide and it was very nice to see Adil himself showing up at our hotel.The tour was super fun, and the 7 hours went by really fast.We went to the Atlas mountain, visited a market full of locals, smelled the fresh fruits, vegetables, walked around just as if we were part of the comunnity.We also went to visit a Berber village, we brought a lot of toys and candies for the berber village kids and we were able to give the gifts to the kids throughout our trip...Adil knows the kids and families by name and the kids are so polite and thankful. It is so cool to see how he tries to help his comunnity.We had lunch at a berber home, everything was clean and nicely presented...and the food was delicious, we went to some of the best restaurants there and let me tell you...the lunch at the berber home was super delicious.We told Adil we were interested in buying rugs and may be sculptures and he took us to a big moroccan store near the Atlas mountain, kind of a hidden gem kinda place...we ended up buying 1 big beautiful imperial rug, a leather rug and a white beautiful wool rug...an amazing side table with camel bones and stones and a copper beautiful vase. ADIL was very helpful and he bargained the price and got us very good deals (he saved us a lot of money)- he had our backs.We also did a camel ride, This will cost u an extra 20 euros for 2 people and it takes 20 minutes...our boy guide was adorable and very kind...make sure to tip him...they were very polite and he offered to take pics of us...he took like 40 pics....very good ones!Adil took a lot of pics of us also, he was gracious, kind, knowledgeable, punctual and funny.i had a mini early bday celebration and we went to the only michelin star restaurant in Marrakech, GastroMK, he knows the owners, the food was incredible and i got 2 glasses of champagne from him as a surprise, (make sure u go to this restaurant).When we go back to morocco, we will do another of the tours he offers.Make sure to reserve your spot in advance, there is a reason his company has 475 , 5 star reviews!!!To summarize my review:Book your tour, enjoy it, it is a unique experience! And a must Do... i am a very picky guy, and i loved the whole tour! ^_^"

Having booked 4x4 Camel via email only a week earlier, Adil had not been able to confirm who would be our guide for the day. But we were delighted when Adil himself turned up at our Riad ten minutes earlier than we'd expected. He was thoroughly professional, amusing and very informative throughout the day. It was so interesting going round the Berber market and my husband was even persuaded to go on a camel ride, something he'd sworn he would never do again after an experience in Egypt! We then went up into the Atlas mountains and had a first stop at an Argan oil cooperative which was interesting. We brought home a jar of paste to eat and had thought it might not taste as good as it had done in Morocco, but we were not disappointed. We also bought some for hair and skin but only time will tell on that front! Our lunch on a rooftop in a tiny village was absolutely delicious and plentiful and this was all included in the price. We had plenty of opportunities to stop and take photos. All in all, a great day and one which we would highly recommend especially if you are staying in the Medina and just fancy a day away from the mayhem."

Nothing was too much trouble and a tour to the Atlas Mountains and return airport transfers were arranged in no time. We went on the Two Valleys trip and it was incredible. We were picked up promptly by Adil #2 in a comfortable 4x4 and started our trip. We stopped off lots of times to take photos and the scenery was breathtaking, especially the snow covered mountains. Adil really is knowledgeable and told us lots about Moroccan history and stories about the places we were visiting. The Argan Oil Cooperative was very interesting and I could not believe the amount of work it took to produce the oil. I did buy quite a few products so can vouch for the quality. Definitely better than the oil available in the main square in Marrakech. The absolute highlight was lunch at a Berber home. We were made to feel so welcome and the food was delicious. We met lots of children along the way so if you can then maybe take along some pens, pencils, school supplies and a few sweets. They really will be appreciated. This really was the highlight of the trip. Marrakech is a busy and vibrant place so to escape to somewhere as beautiful as this and to get a glimpse into Berber life really was special. If I ever visit again I will be booking other tours with 4x4."

Adil(2) was the most fantastic guide - he was at our hotel ready for us early and the whole day from beginning to end was brilliant. We had been disappointed with the level of commercial tourism that is on offer in the medina, it's so tacky in places and some of the goods cheap, insincere etc but with Camel 4 x 4 everything was truly authentic in every sense of the word. The weekly market, the Berber village, lunch, the mountains were just stunning!!! The roads were untouched in many areas and we really felt that we were seeing parts of hidden Morocco. The Berber children were so cute and lovely. Adil was truly brilliant at explaining the history and answering any questions we had, so patient and helpful. I cannot recommend this tour highly enough. Breathtakingly beautiful in places - we are so glad that we escaped Marrakech!! Thank you! We will recommend this to everyone we know!"

We had booked the three valleys trip and was not disappointed. Our driver/guide Majid was great company throughout the day and very attentive to our needs . We chose to visit the Berber Museum rather than a camel ride and so glad we did as it was a lovley way to meet local villagers and learn the traditional method of family living. Make sure you take plenty of pens/pencils for the local children as they wait on every bend of the ascent of the mountain road on the way up the valley. Visited the local weekly Berber market then onto the Argan Oil Womans Co-operative to learn the art of producing the oil (for both beauty and food) from the nut. As many others have already stated its more expensive than the manufactured oil but there was no pressure to purchase. As there had been floods a few days earlier some roads were blocked by fallen boulders, trees or flowing water. The canyon and ravine had rapids of red water but this all added to the beauty of the valley and what was yet to come. The drive from the green/red valley up to the snow cap mountains was amazing the views are breathtaking with many stops to take in the scenery and photographs although to be honest they really do not do justice to the view that you stand in awe of. 3 hours after leaving the bustling city of Marrakesh we found ourselves walking/slipping through snow to get to the Berber home that was to host our traditional lunch and the most amazing views of the day. This was the highlight of the trip. The family were so welcoming and the homemade lunch was the best meal of our whole holiday. Even when we left the house and made the journey back to Marrakesh there were still further views and scenery to take your breath away. We cannot recommend this trip enough. This was the highlight of our holiday."

The day trip to the Atlas Mountains was an immensely enjoyable experience and something I would highly recommend to anyone planning a visit to Marrakech.The correspondence with Adil through email was always very prompt, friendly and informative. Our guide Aziz was also very patient and helpful, he arrived at 9 on the dot whilst we were still eating breakfast and patiently waited for us with no word of complaint.We were feeling groggy throughout the day so were content to just admire the scenery from the car which was really comfortable and airy. Aziz offered to stop the car anytime we wanted for photo opportunities and answered any questions and queries we had.The camel ride and visiting Ourika valley were probably the highlights of our trip, we only wished we had drunk from the spring. The camel ride was extremely comfy and non smelly which was a pleasant surprise for us as we had expected it to be a little bumpy, it was, however, far more comfortable than sitting on a horse.Visiting the Argan Oil Cooperative was very insightful and all the women we met were warm and friendly. We even had practice crushing a nut which was a lot harder than it looked but eventually we all managed to crack one. There were plenty of Berber children around, seeing their smiling faces after handing them sweets and toys was extremely warming. I think everyone who is thinking of taking this tour should bring plenty of toys, books etc for the children as they really appreciate it. However whilst we had bought plenty of sweets and toys we still ended up running out and felt a little guilty so I would recommend that people hand items out in small quantities to ensure that more children receive something.The lunch we had at the Berber house was amazing especially the soup and tangine, easily the best we had on our trip. The oranges served too were juicy and sweet and our hosts really friendly and welcoming. The view on the roof made the meal all the more enjoyable.There was a small issue regarding money confusion on our end as we had to convert the currency twice but both Aziz and Adil, through email, were very helpful in sorting through the confusion. Overall I would say that the trip had been a great one and we hope to book other excursions with 4x4 on any further trips we might take to Morrocco."

Right from the start we were very impressed with the prompt reply when we submitted a request for the atlas mountain day trip via email, I don't think I've ever had anyone reply to an email so quickly! The company was very organised and professional. We had Adil (no: 2) as our driver/ tour guide, he was extremely helpful and informative about Moroccan and particularly Berber culture. The Berber market was an amazing experience nothing like the medina, nobody pestered you or tried to get you to buy, you could look without hassle. The animals- there were so many animals everywhere, goats, sheep, chicken you name it! It seemed to be very much a way of Berber life, I found it hilarious when a local on a bike had his goat sitting with him bleat by way of a horn- only in Morocco! The Berber children we met up the mountain were adorable- be sure to bring some sweets/ school supplies as they really are appreciated. The lunch at the local Berber house was delicious traditional soup and chicken tangine. Also if you can do the optional camel ride it's a great experience. Adil (2) went out of his way for us, we had a problem getting money out with our card, so he let us keep the money for the trip till we got back to hotel where he patiently waited for reception to sort it out for us, we really appreciated that and thanks again Adil for your kindness and patience.It's not the most cheapest of excursions but it's worth it, the scenery views were beautiful and seeing the real Berber culture and how they make a living the carpets shop too was an insight into story behind carpet/ rug weaving. You should definetly book with 4x4 camels, you won't regret it."

This tour is truly a must and Camel 4x4 is definitely the best company in terms of value and service.We will consider the company for booking a different tour in the future.Thank you so much - You have made our trip very special!"

We did a day trip to Atlas Mountains, Ourika valley, and Berber villages and it turned out to be a great day, would definitely recommend it to others. You'll see a different side of Morocco, more scenic, more quiet but just as interesting as the Medina in Marrakech.PROS:- Communication with Adil (the tour organizer) is fast and goes really smoothly.- Fun and interesting places and activities on the way: local market (totally different from the souks in the Medina, at least ours was), optional camel ride, Women Argan Oil Cooperative.- BEST chicken tajine and couscous we had on our trip to Morocco. We scraped the tajine pot as clean as possible. CONS:- Communication with the driver was somewhat limited. He did introduce the things we saw, told stories, talked about the facts and made stops but it took us a while until we understood everything he was saying and therefore we didn't step into conversation with him very often. (But there should be several drivers.)"

Saw many different parts of the Atlas Mountains, visited a local market where we were the only tourists and also a women's co operative making and selling Argan oil. Then went to a village where we were served lunch in the home of one of the villagers out on the terrace with stunning view of the mountains. There were two other couples who joined us for the meal but we each had our own tables. The food was delicious. Would recommend this trip to everyone."

We are so glad we booked this trip, from the email communication with Adil to picking us up at our Riad on time, the trip was perfect. We learnt so much about the history and culture and Adil was happy to answer any questions we had. We visited a Berber market which was fascinating, then driving up into the mountains - they really are stunning. We stopped for a camel ride which was great and we have some amazing photos. We visited the Argan Oil cooperative and then onto a traditional Berber house for a homemade lunch on their terrace with the most amazing views. We were picked up at 9.00am and dropped back at the medina at 4.00pm, the cost was 150 euros for the two of us - well worth every penny. We can't recommend highly enough, thanks again Adil"

We were astonished when, after a delicious lunch overlooking a stunning view, a huge birthday cake arrived! Home cooked by the kindly Berber woman and complete with candles.

The tour to the Atlas mountains was a private tour. We where collected from our hotel and Our driver was very helpful and went ut of his way to help. An example - I needed to know where I could purchase a plug socket for my charger. We where taken to a store where I purchased the item. The trip then proceeded. The market was eye opening - images will remain with me! It is a hard life in the mountains. We did participate in the camel ride - great picture opportunity. The day we visited the mountains it rained!! But the mist did clear and we where able to gain some insight into mountain life. The berber meal in the family home was awesome and very humbling. You are asked to bring sweets/ clothes to hand out for the children on the routes - I wish I had taken things for the schools. Infants attend the morning classes and junior/senior go to school in the afternoons.Because of the poor weather conditions our driver took us further - an unexpected bonus. There are toilets on the way."

Adil and his team are so professional, from the moment we booked the tour I knew by the way they handle their business we were going to enjoy the adventure. We were collected in our Riad and transported by a very comfortable new Toyota Landcruiser which made the journey very comfortable. We were given the option of a camal ride or a visit to the Berber museum and we opted for the museum trip which was so informative and enjoyable, where we leaned about Berber carpets and traditions. We then visited the womens cooperative for making Argan Oil and continued through the stunning High Atlas for the rest of the day. The scenery is breathtaking and we really felt we were getting off the beaten track with Adil's expert knowledge and driving skills. Prior to the tour it was subtly suggested we might bring pencils and stationary for the Berber children we met along the way, which we did. However we really wished we had brought so much more. This children are living in such remote parts and really have nothing. It was a truly humbling experience giving them what we had brought. Adil also brought some clothes and socks which he was giving out as well. This company really promotes sustainable and responsible tourism and I can not recommend the tour highly enough. We finished our day with a delicious lunch in a traditional Berber home, the food was amazing and it was another highlight. You will not be disappointed if you book this trip. It is so worth it."

What more could we ask?!We also chose to make the short camel ride, a well trodden tourist path, but huge fun.Our gifted stationery and sweets were received with genuine gratitude and politeness by the local kids (and the widowed and divorced women at the Cooperative). This seems an accepted additional way for tourism to benefit the villagers.The views driving through the valleys were spectacular. We have beautiful photos and very fond memories. Thank you."

            "review": "\"The Best Experience in Marrakech \". And that is a direct quote from my 12 and 10 year olds. If you don't book a trip with 4x4 Camel Tours, you will miss out on the beautiful Berber country, a day full of history and an over all wonderful experience. Adil was a great guide. He is full of passion, energy and knowledge. With a great personality and fluent English, he kept the kids engaged. The Berber market, camel ride, argon oil cooperative were great experiences. Seeing the Berber children and having lunch in a true Berber home is enough to make you book the trip. Honestly, like the other reviews said, you won't get a better meal in a more beautiful and authentic location.....well worth the cost in itself. Make sure you bring sweets for the kids....they see the cars coming and look forward to the treats. If possible bring school supplies or clothing, it is needed and appreciated. Adil was great. We wanted a true Berber rug and he told us to buy in the mountains where they are made and cut out the middle man. He helped us buy an authentic rug and educated us on the ways of Moroccan commerce.....Thank Adil. We will think of you and the Berbers every time we see the rug.If you do only one thing in Marrakech, you must do the Atlas Mountain Tour with 4x4 Camel Tours......it was the best. You won't be disappointed."

            "review": "Outstanding Tour of Atlas Mountains. Based on the amazing reviews on tripadvisor, we booked the \"Deux Valleys\" trip into the Atlas Mountains. This was probably the highlight of our trip to Morocco. The hustle and bustle of Marrakech is great, but it was wonderful to see so much more via this tour. Pre-coordination was easy via email. We had a 1 year child with us, and the company provided a car seat which made the trip possible for us. Our driver Adil who was right on time at the hotel. The SUV was clean and comfortable with 3 rows of seating so it can fit 5-6 people. We had two in the 3rd row seating in the back, and at times they had a little difficulty hearing Adil on occasion, but nothing too problematic. After maybe 45 minutes drive, the first stop was for the camel ride. It's obviously for tourists, but way better than some of the similar camel ride stops we passed. The camels were calm and followed an offroad walking path. I was able to hold my 1 year old in front of me on the camel - he loved it! Kept wanting to pet the camel. Later we stopped for mint tea (included) at a nice outdoor location with a great view. We stopped at an argan oil place where they showed us how they made it and offered us the opportunity to buy some, but this was not a high pressure sale. Throughout the drive the scenery was amazing, and Adil was happy to stop occasionally for picture taking. We stopped for lunch at a berber village about 1pm. It was probably the best meal we had in Morocco, and was such an amazing cultural experience. The family was very hospitable. And again, the view was incredible. In the email coordination, Adil recommended we bring something to give to children as we drove through villages, such as candies or school supplies. We brought pencils and paper and enjoyed giving them out to the eager and polite children along the road. I would estimate there were 30 kids in total, usually in groups of 3-4, if you want to plan your items accordingly. Most were about 4-8 in age I think. In total, there were probably about 20 minutes worth of real off-road driving due to poor mountainous roads in case this makes you nervous. I never felt unsafe in the vehicle though, especially since Adil drives these roads every day. He had us back the hotel right about 4pm as promised."

We booked this day trip on our 4 day holiday to Marrakech on the strength of other reviews and on the very helpful friendly and prompt email replies to our enquiries and we were not disappointed. We visited Morocco pre children 15 years ago and hired a car and did a similar tour but this despite our scepticism was so much better. For our children 12,10 and 8 it was a great cultural and exciting experience; no hassle , no worries , just a great day out. I would definitely recommend this trip if you, have children , just a short time in Morocco, or both or neither! Adil (number 2) picked us up from our Riad promptly and was lovely and friendly. He was also a very careful and steady driver (perfect as 3 out of 5 of us get travel sick). He was informative and amusing on the history of Morocco and answered all our questions. The market town was a genuine local market and great to be immersed in normality. Hardly anyone bothered us or hassled us and Adil negotiated a great Djlellaba for my son (who wore it for the rest of the holiday! The kids enjoyed the camel ride immensely and we walked alongside - perfect length and pretty scenery in the foothills. The Argan oil factory was informative, the ladies allowed the kids to have a go cracking the nuts, and whilst of course we did feel obliged to buy something (delicious oil though pricey) we did this gladly as it is such a great scheme supporting divorced and widowed women in working and gaining independent -quite enlightened for a Muslim country according to Adil. The drive through the mountains was fun with amazing scenery and we stopped frequently to give the local children sweets and stationery which we had brought - again especially humbling for our children who were amazed at the boy and his pre school sister walking miles after their school day ended to collect the family firewood. Lunch at a Berber house was delicious and there was so much to eat ( we did feel slightly embarrassed leaving some of it)and the atmosphere , eating outside siting on Berber rugs on the terrace looking towards the snow covered peaks was perfect. Another stunning drive back to Marrakech with more great views. A great day and the highlight of our trip . Thank you all!"

We started out from our Riad in Marrakesh, stopped along the way for a 20 minute camel ride (great fun, certainly long enough to be riding a camel), then drove up into the stunning Atlas Mountains, spending about 30 minutes off road. Along the route, we stopped at a women's collective which produced cosmetics, and had lunch in a private home in a Berber village, which was surprisingly pleasant.The scenery was breathtaking! As advised when we booked this, we took with us paper, pencils and sweets which we gave to the children (many of whom Adil #2 knew by name) and they certainly seemed to need them. I have experienced many tours all over the world, but this certainly stands out as being one of the best.

It was my first time on a camel and the 20 minutes was by far enough time. This was my least favourite part of the tour, but worth it if you want to get your token photo on a camel. We then travelled through several valleys with breathtaking views. Adil was very accommodating and stopped several times so we could take photos. Our next stop was at an Argan oil cooperative where we saw how the products are made - we brought home Argan oil and peanut butter and they're great! Finally, we stopped for lunch at a Berber family's home and had a traditional lunch of couscous and tagine chicken. Not only was the food some of the best we had during our entire stay, the views and surroundings were breathtaking. This trip is highly recommended!"

            "review": "Great day money well spent. Our day started promptly at 9 am we were picked up by our guide for the day adil who was well spoken friendly and knowledgeable guy . His english was great so no problems what so ever. We headed out of marrakech in the Toyota 4x4 first stop was a traditional barber weekly market where we saw the locals doing their weekly shopping and trading coming and going on donkey back very interesting.Then we headed further out towards the mountains the weather was lovely next stop camel ride great again up and down the hills lots of photos the camel guide offered to take photo no problems great experience . After which we visited the Aragon oil Fectory toured by a very nice young lady nice place bought some soaps etc. after that we headed off road up the mountains stopped at every opportunity to take photo our guide Adil always offering to take photos not rushing .breathtaking scenery . Next stop at a local house for lunch what can I say got exactly what we wanted home cooked chicken tagin /couscous /soup fresh bread nice then we sat on terrace overlooking the mountain and had some mint tea and fresh local orenges nice Very nice. Then the drive back we were all quite tired slept all the way back . Overall a great day out will defenetly do it againI really like the way 4x4 operate small groups mostly 4 or 2 people per guide and vehicle which I think is good as I have been on other tours where you get paired with others makes it quite difficult if they speak a different lengauge can't communicate so well done to the guys at 4x4 hope they carry on with the same serviceThanks for making our trip so memorable."

If you are researching a trip to do while in Marrakech, stop wasting your time and just book this one, you won't be disappointed!I'd read other Trip Advisor reports for this 4x4 excursion before we went, so it already had a lot to live up to. It achieved this and more. I'd exchanged emails with Adill, the boss man, but on the day, we were met by one of his drivers, Aziz. I was initially a little concerned, because it wasn't the driver I'd expected, but this was unfounded as Aziz is a fantastic guide. I think there are three drivers. I've not met the other two, but Aziz is the best! :-)The views on this trip were FANTASTIC! And because we were in a 'private' trip, we could stop where & when we wanted to take photos or simply admire the stunning scenery. Some people in our hotel did the Thomson tour. It cost the same, didn't do as much and because they were multiple people in the vehicle and in a 'convoy', they weren't able to just stop randomly. Aziz is an excellent guide, talking from personal experiences of his country. For example, how this multi-lingual man was illiterate until conscripted to the army, where he initially learned to read, then moved on to foreign languages. Or how he had been a support vehicle driver for the Paris-Dakar races. The high point of the day, literally & metaphorically was lunch at a Berber village. We were on the roof of the Imam's house looking down the valley or across to the snow capped mountains. The food was traditional and delightful but the key element to the experience is that somehow my vision had been switched from 'standard' to 'high definition'. Everything just looked clearer, brighter, sharper. Beautiful.All in all, a fantastic experience that I can't possibly recommend highly enough. Now stop reading reviews and go book this trip!"

            "review": "Wonderful Experience. We did the \"Deux Vallees\" tour, and had initially been hesitant about booking it as we don't normally do escorted tours, preferring to travel independently. However, I am so glad that we did it, we could never have done this by ourselves, particularly not with our 10 year old son. It was a fantastic and memorable experience from beginning to end. We had seen that the weather forecast was bad for the day we had booked to go, and Adil was very helpful and accommodating in changing the day of our trip for us at very short notice. The whole tour was very thoughtful, with great consideration for ourselves and for the local communities that we were visiting. The car we travelled in was clean and comfortable. We had Adil 2 as our guide and he was very friendly and incredibly knowledgeable about the history of Marrakech and Morocco in general, and was a very safe and careful driver. The scenery and views of the snow-capped mountains were incredible. The journey did not feel too long as it was broken up with several stops, including a camel ride (the highlight of my son's holiday !), a visit to a small Berber market, which was an amazing contrast to Marrakech, and a visit to the Argan Oil cooperative. As mentioned in other reviews, the Argan oil products are relatively expensive, but reflect the true cost of production, and we felt that buying from here was a good way to contribute. The meal at the Berber house is something that we will always remember - peaceful, quiet, amazing views from the terrace and lovely food, and hopefully a positive contribution to the Berber family. We also visited a local primary school where Adil 2 gave the pens and pencils that we had brought to the teacher to give out as he thought appropriate. It would have been nice to do a bit more walking, which I am sure we could have done if we had asked, but there was so much to see that we didn't want to stop for too long in one place. The whole trip was excellent, and was the highlight of our short visit to Morocco. I would really recommend going with this company, they are well-organised and thoughtful, and seem to be very concerned about the communities that they travel within."

We booked this tour for Sunday after New Years and were lucky to have Adil as our tour guide as he is very friendly, knowledgable and passionate about his work. As he told us \"Your day goes by quick when you really enjoy what you do.\" There were 4 of us in total (2 couples) and the trip came out to 50 Euro p/person + 10 Euro p/p for camel rides. (The minimum cost is 150 Euro for 2 people). Adil met us at our Riad, then drove us to the local Berber market, an Argan oil cooperative, through the Atlas mountains, then to a local Berber home where we had lunch on their beautiful terrace. The lunch was home cooked and delicious! What was so touching and inspirational was that Adil found a way to bring tourism and an income to Berber people that may not otherwise have this opportunity. When Adil emailed back saying that we could bring notebooks, used clothing, sweets, etc. for the local children, we did not understand how much this was needed. We brought with us 2 coloring books, 2 pack of crayons, 2 packs of markers and a bag of chocolates. We really wish we brought more! As you drive through the villages the children are playing on the sides of the roads because they have nowhere else. We would stop along the way giving each child 1 marker and/or 1 chocolate and that small gesture made them light up. We asked Adil if we could send things for the children after we return home but he said that it's not worth the price because the package gets stopped at the border and then he has to still pay the taxes for the items. Which is ridiculous. The tour was really incredible and I recommend it to anyone that wants a local, genuine and inspirational experience. It was truly amazing! Thank you Adil!"

Like everyone has mentioned, Adil was easy to get a hold of and gave us clear instructions on how to find his colleague, Aziz, for the pickup. If you have the option, schedule the excursion on a Tuesday as that is the day of the Berber day market. Visiting that market is an experience in itself. My favorite was seeing the \"donkey parking lot;\" a sea of donkeys that the villagers take to the market. The day was followed by a trip to a co-op, Moroccon Tea by the river, and a traditional Berber lunch at a house in one of the villages. Remember to bring some goodies to give the local children. This is a must do in Marrakech. Don't miss out!"

We booked this super last minute (4 days out) and were fortunate they were able to accommodate us. It was our favorite activity in Morocco by far. About $120 USD per person and then we tipped pretty heavily because they were incredible.Our guide was Adil 2, but we also met Adil 1 (who emailed back and forth with us). Both men were incredibly genuine, friendly and knowledgable. Their love for their country is evident and they were super welcoming and hospitable. We spent the entire day together and the tour was perfectly planned - a well-oiled machine, really! From Adil picking us up promptly at 9AM until around 4:30/5pm when he showed us a dinner spot then dropped us back off, it was amazing. Beautiful scenery, friendly people, delicious food...I mean really, I have nothing negative to say except that I wish it never ended :)We are two mid-twenties American females and felt safe and looked after the entire time and were even given tips on Marrakech dining and nightlife. I also loved that they care so much for the local Berber people. They mention (very low-pressure and you don't feel obligated) that tourists can bring small gifts like pencils, markers or school supplies for the children. They passed these out to the children along the way.Side note, they also offered to plan multiple-day trips around Morocco to various cities if (....WHEN...because we loved Morocco and are definitely going back to Morocco!) we come back to visit again. I highly recommend this company and would jump at the chance to tour with them again."

While Marrakech was beautiful and we loved our time there, the tour felt like the perfect match to show us the beautiful Atlas mountains, learn more about the Moroccan culture, visit a local market and take in amazing scenery. We were lucky and went on a Monday- so we visited a weekly market that really showed us how locals lived and shopped. We went through 3 valleys and were constantly amazed by the beautiful scenery and the difference in how it felt compared to the hustle and bustle of the Old City. The highlight of the tour was definitely the meal in the Berber village on a roof top terrace. Best food of our time in Morocco and a stunning view. Adil was very kind and always eager to share his country, take photos for us, and be an amazing guide. Highly recommend!"

Our tour started with camel rides which I was hesitant about but thoroughly enjoyed in the end. We visited a river cafe with a beautiful waterfall for tea and then drove up into the mountains and saw so many berber villages and children along the way to whom we gave pens and pencils that we brought with us and it was a pleasure to see their faces light up. (Please if you are going to do this trip take some thing either pens, pencils, colouring pens even old clothes for the children) The argan oil cooperative was informative with some lovely products. The highlight of my day was lunch at the Berber house where we met up with the two other groups that were out that day but we still felt as if we were on our own as we all had our own sections of the terrace area where we ate some wonderful food such as soup, fresh bread, chicken tagine, cous cous and vegetables, fruit and of course washed it all down with mint tea. The best meal I had in Marrakech topped off with beautiful views of the mountains with their snowcapped peaks.The views of the Atlas mountains with their snow topped peaks were wonderful.My teenage son thoroughly enjoyed this day and loved the knowledge that was imparted by Adil. I would have no hesitation to do another tour with Adil and company and would highly recommend.Thank you for making our first trip to Marrakech so very enjoyable."

We visited a Berber market, had tea right by a waterfall, visited the oil co-operative (lovely products), met some of the village children (Adil distributed the felt tips and coloured pencils we had brought) and had a delicious lunch (soup, tagine, cous cous and oranges), kindly cooked by Fatima, on the terrace of a village house with a beautiful view.

However, after some research we discovered that many people didn't like this trip, so we scrambled to find a day trip to replace the Zagora trip. I accidentally came across the Trip Advisor page for 4X4 Camel, and I AM SO GLAD I DID!I couldn't believe how many positive reviews Adil had, and knew we had to get a booking with him. It was very last minute, and seeing as there is only Adil and his two other co-workers, I was worried he would not have an availability to accommodate 5 of us. HOWEVER, Adil was very prompt in replying via email and phone...we booked a trip right away, and we found out during the trip that Adil was actually working on his day off! Adil was such a genuine guy, he knew a lot about the areas, and would stop the car every time we saw kids of the village and he actually got out of the car to talk to the little children of the Village and gave them pens, pencils, books and clothing. Price wise: the trip was definitely worth it. As a group of students, we ended up paying about 40 euros each and honestly, none of us complained at the end of the day since the whole day was amazing. At the end, we were saying to each other how we didn't want to go back to Marrakech and have the day end! All in all, it was a beautiful day. We drove up to see the Oureka and Asni valleys, stopped for mint tea along the way. But the best part was honestly having lunch at the Berber family's house--it was the best tagine and soup we've ever had. But what made it so special was that they had prepared everything for us on their rooftop terrace, and as you ate lunch you could see the snowcapped mountains, the houses of the Berber village, and green rolling hills. Just absolutely breathtaking! Would definitely recommend this tour to all my friends going to Marrakech, and if I ever go back, I know who to call!Thank you so much Adil!!"

These women deserve our support.The Atlas mountains are spectacular. It is fascinating to see how the geology influences the built environment. It is also encouraging to see that people still want to live in rural areas - there were so many kids. It was great to meet them and be able to give them small gifts. I know it can seem patronising and feel uncomfortable for us 'first worlders' but the smiles on their faces said the kids loved it, and that's all that matters.Visiting a genuine Berber home and having food cooked for us was wonderful. We were lucky to have great weather, and sat out on the roof terrace, enjoying the magnificent view while eating our tagine and cous cous.When I heard about how this 4x4 enterprise is helping to change the lives of families, by giving them the chance to earn some income, and showing us visitors how the people really live, I was very impressed. Well done Adil and everyone involved.This is a great project, good value for money, and was the best thing we did in Marrakech."

The view was great and food was good but we have had better.Just to clarify we are originally from south asia and the berber village/market was nothing new for us, the views and the argan oil factory was though interesting. Overall it came to just more then \u00a360pp and once you add the camel ride its nearly \u00a370pp.I have been to Dubai and had a full days experience there which is cheaper and you get more attractions more food.

The guide picked us up from our hostel at 9am and drove towards the Atlas mountains, stopping wherever we wanted to get photos of the beautiful landscape en route. 1st stop was a Berber village market which was an eye-opening experience. The guide was very kind and generous in covering all the tips for the locals that we took photos with (e.g. local dentist, barber and donkey park owner) and he did this in a subtle and tasteful manner. Took us right through the market and explained in detail what each stall was selling. We had visited an Argan oil store on a previous trip so the guide skipped this part of the tour for us, but is worthwhile seeing how it is made & getting a chance to buy some of the products. We then stopped at the foothills of the mountains to enjoy a 20min camel ride, which was an optional addition to the tour and cost a bit extra. They don't take you around a particularly scenic route but if you've never been on a camel before and you're with a friend/in a group it's fun nonetheless. We then drove up into the mountains to enjoy the beautiful scenery, with the guide offering very interesting facts about the history and culture of Berbers and Arabs. We were advised before the tour to bring pencils and pens to hand out to local kids along the route up the mountain - glad we did as the kids loved it and on the most part were very appreciative. I recommend that you take sweets as well and avoid taking putty/rubbers as the kids confused these for edible sweets. The driver dropped us off at a particularly scenic part of the Ourika valley which allowed us to walk up the mountain and take in the views. We later caught up with him to drive to the final destination which was a Berber house where we ate our lunch. This was the most delicious meal we had in Marrakech. Never thought Moroccan salad (essentially tomato, onion and seasoning) could taste so good, and the tagine was also the best we'd had in Morocco. This trip was worth every penny and was the highlight of our week."

Once Adil found out that my friend and I didn't have breakfast that morning, he immediately stopped at a gorgeous restaurant that overlooked the valley and bought us a delicious Morrocan breakfast. It was so sweet of Adil and really shows how he's willing to go the extra mile to ensure that his customers are satisfied. I don't want to spoil the excursion for you because Adil likes to surprise his customers, but basically the rest of our day consisted of a camel ride (costs an extra 10 euros/ person), a stop at an argon oil cooperative (we never felt pressured to buy anything), and an incredible home cooked lunch with a Berber family overlooking the Atlas Mountains (best part of the day! But come hungry because they cook a lot of food!!!)The thing that I liked most about this experience was that Adil was so flexible. He will literally do whatever you want-- you just need to tell him! For example, if you want to spend more time at the market, you can spend more time there. If you want Adil to stop the car so you can take a picture of the gorgeous scenery, he'll stop the car. The entire day is personally tailored to your likings. Other notes:The cost of the tour is 150 euros per GROUP, not per person, which is an excellent deal! He can fit up to four passengers in his car. I'm sure he can still accommodate you if you have a larger group. It was very safe. As two females traveling alone, safety was a concern of ours, and Adil made us feel very safe. This is a great excursions for anyone, including families with children, solo travelers, couples, etc. Overall, it was a great escape from the chaos of Marrakech and definitely the highlight of our trip!! Thank you Adil for the great memories!"

Throughout the whole journey we never stopped learning, and were completely at ease with our host. Something that particularly stood out to us, was that this tour incorporated numerous social projects. The thought that had gone into the whole day was amazing and rather than just awkwardly observing way of life, we were immersed into it."

We weren't but he was happy to wait until we were ready. On the way, Adil talked us through the day and told us many facts and stories about Marrakesh and Morocco in general. Very interesting and entertaining. We stopped at a first market and that wasn't the best part of the trip really but interesting (that's just my point of view and a lot of people seemed to have loved this part of the trip). Then we did some camel ride and that was great! The lunch was absolutely amazing! On the way back, we asked him to stop at Jardin Majorelle instead of our hotel and he did it very nicely! Very happy about everything. All in all very happy about his company and friendliness! :) We read on the internet that you can find the same kind of trip by renting a car and a chauffeur for far less money. However, it wouldn't include the lunch and Adil was so friendly that the additional money was totally worth it. :) Would highly recommend it."

Recent weather had meant rivers bursting their banks and bridges being swept away, so there was some trepidation as to whether the tour would actually take place. Advil understood this and we kept in close contact during my stay.I was a sole traveller and booked the tour as such. Ya Ya collected me from my RIad promptly at 9am and I enjoyed his narrative as well as the stops at the small market, Argan cooperative and Berber family for lunch. The views are amazing, and timed right as snow had arrived on the higher mountains earlier in the week. We stopped as needed for photos and nothing was too much hassle for Ya Ya. Chocolates and kids clothes were well received by the Berber children and brought a smile to all.I'd happily book with Adil and his company again for further excursions should I return to Marrakech in future."

We started at a really local market and had the opoortunity to experience this especially unique atmosphere. Adil helped us buying toys (and toothbrushes!) for the children who ran after our car already waiting for the goods things they would get. There was an optional camel ride which we enjoyed very much and also the presentation of argan oil (you are not onbliged to buy, but it makes a fine gift and as a support it is for a good purpose). After a trip through the mountains we had lunch with a local family and my personal highlight was to get a birthday cake even though my birthday was only one day later! Normally lunch is served on the roof terrace but, unfortunately, we were not so lucky about the weather. But having lunch sitting (almost) on the floor in a typical Berber living room is also a very interesting experience and we loved it! After that we returned to Marrakech where we arrived even one half an hour later than advised. It was a great day and a perfect start to our stay in Marrakech, which, after having got all these informations from Adil, we could enjoy even more intensely!"

Following a recommendation from a colleague I heard that a day trip to the Atlas Mountains was doable and Adil and his team were good.This was 100% the case, our driver Aziz was very knowledgeable about the towns, valleys and communities we passed. We were a group of 4 that were very comfortable in the 4*4. We drove through three valleys stopping at authentic berber villages, markets and view points. There were so many highlights, for me stopping for tea by a mountain river and learning how Moroccan tea is made was great, having lunch in the Imam's family house in the berber village and eating traditional Morrocan tagines was great. Stopping to give children pens in the mountains and learning about the produce of the mountains and seeing snow cap peaks. All amazing.This trip really provides a contrast to Marrakech and I would say that even if you only have a couple of days, 100% do the tour. Aziz was charming and I highly recommend regardless of whether you are alone or in a group.Top tip: You will have an opportunity to give something back to the villages you pass through, something as simple as a pen will light up the faces of the kids."

We also thought the Argan oil co-operative part of the trip was very interesting.

We were picked up at our hotel at 9 by Adil's coworker. Driving out of the city center, we learned so much, and our driver told us a lot about the history of Marrakech, Marroco in general and the Berber people. Very interesting! Our first stop was the camels. It was a bit scary at first, but an amazing experience. The boy that were in charge of our camles took loads of pictures of us, and we are so happy about that. The camels were a lot of fun, and they are really cute! The next stop was the local Berber marked, which was interesting. And then we stopped at the Argan oil cooperative. It's not very cheap here, but as others have written before us - when you buy stuff here, it's for a good cause. We got several gifts and where very happy with the girl that showes us around. On the way to the family for lunch we stopped several places to admire the view, and our driver took several pictures of us! And when you travel as a couple it's always nice to come home with a picture with both of you in it! So thanks again to our wonderful guide!The lunch at the Berber family was amazing. Sitting on the floor, eating amazing food and just looking at the beautiful nature! One of our highlights of the trip! It was an amazing day, although we were pretty tired on our way back to the hotel. I am so glad we did this trip, and I'll make sure to book other trips with Adil and his co-workers if we'll be so lucky to come back to Marrakech again!"

I always wanted to experience a camel ride - glad I did, but never again....... The roads up into the mountains and the subsequent drive out were very scary. There are no crash barriers and Ya Ya insisted on expressing with one hand whilst talking and turning to look at us which was nerve wracking at times!

Looking back I wish that I had asked our guide to barter for some of the amazing spices as he would have got a better deal than we managed in the square the previous day! The market was fascinating.The next stop was an optional camel ride in the dessert. I absolutely loved it and could not stop smiling. After the ride we went to an argan oil cooperative. I was invited up to take part in the manufacturing, and didn't exactly do England proud!We stopped for lunch at a Berber house in the village where we were served a 3 course meal on a terrace overlooking the Atlas Mountains. The memory of that stunning view is something that will stay with me forever.Along the way we stopped off at various points to admire the beautiful valleys. The guide was kind enough to take pictures of us throughout. We also bought pens to hand out to the local children.Without a doubt the most memorable day of any holiday. Such an unique experience.

About a week ago my friend and I went with Adil (2) on a day trip through the Ourika Valley, the Atlas Mountains, visiting a Berber village with lunch in a families home and then back to Marrakesh. Everything about it was perfect. He picked us up at our Riad at 9am sharp and off we went. Adil speaks wonderful English and we loved hearing him talk about the history of Marrakesh, his culture, his people, and everything Moroccan. He clearly loves his work and he loves sharing his amazing country with the people who come to visit it. We couldn't have asked for a more wonderful day or a better guide. We noted that he is registered with government and holds all the necessary licenses with the city and the tourism police so rest assured that he is totally legitimate, knows what he is doing and is fully legal.The mountains and valley are both breathtaking and handing out candy & school supplies to the children of the villages was extremely rewarding. The lunch we had in a families home was DELICIOUS! By far the best food we enjoyed the entire trip.Not only was it a wonderful day all in all but we also love that in the process we have made a new friend! We will be back to Marrakesh and Adil will be my first e-mail!"

We went first to the local Berber market which was fascinating. A genuine local market for the locals rather than the tourists....cooking pots, animal feed, fruit and vegetables. I bought some lovely dates for 25 dirhams for a kilo. They are delicious. We then went to the Argan co-operative where a lovely lady who spoke very good English explained the process to us and then we have the opportunity to purchase a range of products. They are not cheap but good quality genuine article. We then sat beside the river and drank our peppermint tea. We then went off road and Adil asked us if we would like to walk for a little while to take in the lovely views and peacefulness of the mountain road ahead. We met some lovely children along the way up to the Berber village - if you book ahead as we did do take some things with you...for example we had sweets, books, crayons, pencils, toothbrushes, hair slides. The children are delightful and so appreciative of what you give to them. Lunch is served in a Berber house with the most fabulous view over the valley. What a meal it is - so delicious with soup, tagine, and fresh fruit. Best tagine of all our holiday. Adil is a great host and very friendly and easy to talk too.

It was just the two of us, nice and private and super informative! I have traveled all over the world, visited more than 30 countries, been on countless \"day trips to villages\" and this is by far one of my favorites! Adil shows you a day in the life of a berber person and its truly wonderful. We were lucky enough to see a berber market, ten times better than the markets in Marrakech, more unique and true to the berber culture. Then we continued up through the mountains, stopped at a carpet shop that had an outrageous view, met with many berber children along the way and then enjoyed one of the best meals we had in Morocco! Our gracious hosts were so kind and loving, allowing us to take pictures and make ourselves at home! If you are on your way to Morocco and you take this trip with Adil, PLEASE bring English speaking books (for children). Adil is helping the kids to learn English and if I go back to Morocco I want to bring a wealth of items to take to the children! They need crayons (pens/pencils), coloring books and they love sweets ;-) or course! The trip was well priced and 100% worth it! I should have written this review 2 months ago, sorry Adil! Miss you and everyone from Morocco! Amazing place to visit!IN A NUT SHELL1. this is not a \"touristy\" attraction, well thoughtout and not overdone. you can tell its genuine and a a passion of Adils to better the life of the berber village people2. takes a full day3. he stopped at proper restrooms along the way for us4. he drives a 4x4 - seats 4 people, we only had two, I'm not sure if he can take more than 4 at a time5. if you don't bring/buy candy/sweets before hand and you would like to, Adil will stop on the way and you can grab some for cheap 6. I believe its cash only7. Try to go on a day when they have the market, it was really amazing to see the medicine man selling his herbs, the doctor who fixes everything (with no modern medicine) and the bartering of various items 8. No specific dress code or shoes are necessary (no hikes or unstable grounds), just be respectful of the people and dress properly9. Adil can stop at a market so you can get water 10. The lunch is plenty of food - and GREAT food"

We had Adil No 2 and found him to be a very courteous gentle man with a great sense of humour. He gave us all moroccan names and charmed my cynical teenage daughter (who he named princess Raschida) into complying with his wishes when she declined photo opportunities for us!Adil told us many interesting facts about Moroccan history and politics,and kept us totally informed about the trip agenda. We took a camel ride which the kids loved and then rode in the 4 x 4 (which was very comfy and roomy perfect for my huge son) up through the mountains to the Argan oil factory. There a Berber lady who spoke good English gave us a tour and gently charmed us into parting with our Euros. The Berber ladies allowed us to take their photos and were happy for us to see them making the oil. The scenery here is breath taking. There are the most amazing cafes next to the river with couches and tables in vibrant colours,all reached via rickety Indiana Jones style bridges.We then reached the Ourika Valley, as we wanted to see the waterfalls. We met our guide Omar who was sweeeeeet, but I'm afraid we didnt make it to them as the walk was very very steep and strenuous and no amount of coaxing from Omar could persuade princess Raschida to go up a LADDER to the next and last climb to the Ourika waterfalls! You needed goat legs to get up there and if I'd known this I may not have asked to see them. if it had been hot we may have had to leave it but we made it to the first set of falls, which was enough! All the way up these steep paths are people trying to sell you stuff as you wheeze your way up the slippery stones.We came down and Adil showed us to some nice loos next to a restaurant, as he said there'd only be stones to squat behind after this!! We rode up to the Berber village,stopping to give kids who spotted the car, toys and some sweets.Some were really sweet and said thanks others snatched them without a word.When we got to the village, we handed out,the clothes Adil had asked me if I could bring for the children.This was a very humbling experience and my daughter found it upsetting watching the kids grabbing the clothes and clutching them as if their lives depended on it. We then went into the Berber house for lunch.The lady was incredibly sweet and kind. It felt wrong having her wait on us,but the food was awesome and the view from the incredibly simple but gorgeous terrace was unforgetable. We were so lucky to have been allowed to enter her house and eat there. Afterwards we drove back down through the high peaks and Adil told us he'd stop at any time for photos. This was a very wonderful and well organised trip. I can only say they should warn people of the steep and strenous nature of the waterfall walk and although there is no obligation to do anything at all it would save some people from disappointment as you need to be quite fit to do it. A long but wonderfully exhiliarating and interesting day, our hardto please teenagers loved it and I would highly recommend it to anyone. We were very well looked after and it was a wonderful experience!"

Thanks to reading all the reviews on Trip Advisor I booked the 4X4 Camel day trip, in order to be organised I spoke with Adil a number of times, we had 8 guys on the trip and all were blown away by the day's experience. Adil and his colleague works incredibly hard to ensure you capture ever moment and do not miss any opportunities for photographs. We crammed so much into this trip, firstly wedid the camel ride (its a must if you have never done it before) then we travelled to the factory to see oil famous to this part of the world is made. We also stopped for tea by a mountain stream, which was significant for its indiana jones bridge. We enjoyed a walk in the mountains which gave us the appetite for what was one of the best Chicken dishes I have ever tasted. Perhaps the highlight though the trip up the mountain handing out gifts we had brought with us to the local children. Adil was really keen to see all the kids got something and we enjoyed seeing this mean so much to the kids and Adil. When we were dropped off one of the boys had left his coat in the back of the van, Adil made a specal trip on the Sunday to return it. I would highly recommend this trip defnately the highlight of our visit to Marrakech."

Prior to the trip, he was quick to answer my many emails. (I am a bit of a nervous traveler, so I had many questions.) During the trip, he was prompt, courteous and a wealth of knowledge \u2013 talking about the people, culture and geography. He also had a great sense of humor \u2013 adding smiles/chuckles to the trip. The accommodations were basic but wonderful \u2013 full of charm and a sense of the local culture. The staff was warm and welcoming.Our car was clean, spacious and comfortable. The food was really good. Adil was great at assisting us with the menus and ordering. All and all - it was the highlight of our holiday. Our only regret \u2013 we did not hire 4x4 Camel for our 1 day trip to Essaouira. Thank you 4 x 4 Camel for memories that will last a life time!"

Really glad we booked this trip with Adil (in fact it was one of his colleagues that took us as Adil was with an Italian family) We were picked up from our Riad then taken to a local market, on to the Argan Oil coop, into the mountains where we had a superb lunch at a Berber house then back to the RiadThere was four of us and we all enjoyed the experience. Our guide was excellent and could answer any questions that we had. The views were spectacular and The lunch was superbI would thoroughly recommend this trip and it was a nice change from the hustle and bustle of the Medina."

He was very accommodating and stopped when we asked to look at something, as we were a couple on holiday he let us walk for a bit alone and explore. The mountains were breathtaking and the argan oil cooperative was very interesting. Lunch at the Berber house was really great, we didn't need to eat for the rest of the day!!! And the views from the terrace we ate from were astounding. Definitely recommend bringing some small gifts for the village children, we took some pens. Well worth the money, we highly recommend this trip especially getting away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech."

Yahya was our tour guide on the day. He was great, very kind and informative. Our first stop was a camel ride which was great. Then we stopped at an Argan Oil Cooperative. It is very expensive so bring cash with you, you will definitely want to buy something as it's all manual work and the money goes for the women that work there (their husbands have passed away or left so they need the money to raise their kids). You will have lunch at a Berber's family home. The lunch was the best meal we had during the holiday, so worth it. We brought a big bag full of toys, colour pencils and lollies for the kids. Seeing the faces of the kids light up when given the toys & gifts was priceless, I will never forget the experience. Please, please bring some toys, sweets, clothes/shoes with you for the kids. They will really appreciate it."

Having booked a short 4 day trip in Marrakech I wanted to experience something more than the souks and sights and wanted to experience more so having come across 4x4 Camel on tripadvisor and reading the rave reviews I decided to contact Adil and see what experience we could do which would involve visiting the Atlas Mountains, as well as have a camel ride (I was very intent on going on one!). Adil came back to me very quickly with itinerary from 9am-4pm which was a private tour for me and my sisters and I wasn't disappointed.To start our tour guide Yahya met us at the hotel then our journey began whereby we visited two valleys; the first is the Ourika valley. On the way we stopped to experience a 20mins camel ride in the countryside, which was very wobbly(!) but absolutely loved it. After that we then visited the Argan oil women's cooperative, whereby they locally produce Argan oil. The process was explained to us and we were taken to their shop with option to buy various products which we got to try before buying. After we headed towards the second valley (Asni valley) where we stopped at times to take photos and admire the scenic views.Having read various reviews a lot of posters suggested bringing stationary for the local village Berber children so we had quite a few pens/pencils/felt tips which we gave to the local kids for which after we then headed to a traditional family house for a delicious lunch which was first tomato and onion salad, bread and olive oil, the main was a steamed veg couscous which chiken tagine and bread followed by local Berber apples and then some delicious sweet mint tea. The food was phenomenal and with the Atlas mountains as our view whilst eating al fresco was truly something else I will never forget.After we left the Berber home we headed back to city and stopped at times to take amazing pictures then reached our hotel around 4.30pm.It was a wonderful experience, Yahya was brilliant and I would definately recommend using 4x4 to others and did when I met others during my tour at Bahia Palace.Thanks again to Adil and Yahya for this truly great experience."

We enjoy cultural tours that are private and out of the ordinary and preferably away from other tourists, and this was that. Our guide was a great source of information. He was most importantly a good mountain driver so we felt very safe. The experience offered of visiting a village market, riding camels, having lunch in a berber village, stopping along the mountain side for strolls and views, was the perfect combination. We particularly enjoyed our authentic lunch in the home of one of the locals, it was so humbling and exquisitely beautiful. I am glad that they offer this authentic experience and highly recommend it to anyone! Stay true to your business model of authenticity and genuine hosting as it really is an incomparable experience not to be forgotten, and unique."

Then we worked our way up into the mountains and stopped for mint tea in a cafe across a very rickerty rope bridge! The views throughout the day were incredible and we were given plenty of time to take pictures. We stopped off at a traditional village house for lunch; the best chicken we had all holiday! So succulent. Although initially a little uncomfortable about being in someone's home as a tourist, our guide reassured us that our money had enabled the family to extend their house, modify it and send their son to university; the first child in the family to do so. We forgot but any small treats for the children or clothes would be well received by the families. The whole day was so great and I would thoroughly recommend everyone to do it."

I would like to add that personally we have been to over 50 countries, including some remote areas in South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand so when I say that this was one of the best and authentic days we've experienced it's a real commendation of the wonderful day that Adil organised for us.I think what made it particularly special was his sincerity and passion for the people living in the Berber villages. It's inspiring to see him trying to make their lives better whilst at the same time ensuring his guests have an enjoyable and unforgettable day. The lunch was undoubtedly the best food we had in Morocco! The visits to the Argan Oil factory and the market were great fun and we never felt under pressure to buy anything - we just enjoyed the vitality from these lovely people that was so energising.We transferred from Marrakech to Kasbah Taramot via this trip and this was a brilliant way of not wasting a day. So, if you're thinking of a two centre holiday, please do this as we enjoyed this day best of all! Well done Adil - keep supporting the locals as your stories of doing so are very special.Please go on this trip as I truly think you will have one of the best travel days of your life."

This prior information was very helpful and reassuring, and gave us a lot of confidence to book. Yahya picked us up from our hotel at 9am. He is a very knowledgeable man with a nice sense of humour, and gave us facts about the region, and advice about travel.We stopped off at the market (and I had forgotten my cardigan at the hotel) Adil in the car in front gave me a jean jacket that I was really grateful for as it was not only chilly but the locals do stare a bit. We walked through the market... which was an experience... and very interesting. I liked the tagines in the corner which were used by most villagers for day long cooking. I went on the Camel ride (my boyfriend didn't as the camels didn't look very willing to take him on after 3 candidates turned him down) mine was beautiful and calm. I'm a bit scared of heights.... so although nerve racking at times it was really fun... and we have some nice photos of me looking worried. We visited the Argan Oil factory, which is a place where women are able to work and earn a living for their families. We could see every part of the process where every part of the nut was used. The shop allowed us to test the products. Although not obligated to buy anything, we could think of no better souvenir for our mums than Argan oil, where money was helping a great cause. Lunch was fantastic! The ingredients were so fresh and tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the house. The weather wasn't that great when we went up, but the mountains were beautiful nonetheless (as Yahya said) some really did look like tiramisu. He also stopped at points for us to take photos. You'll find... especially in the Medina.. It can be difficult to know who to trust. It was lovely to meet such nice gentlemen on this excursion like Adil and Yahya.Also...thanks Yahya for recommending some great restaurants."

Really nice 4/4 (new toyota land cruiser). We headed off and he relayed the itinerary to us as we drove out of Marrkech.Can't recall all the details of the itinerary but it was great. A lot of driving though and by 3pm I was falling asleep in the 4x4. The lunch with the berber family was a highlight as was handing out treats to the berber kids on the roads up to the village. They were adorable and very well mannered.Adil was a hugely informative host and its clear he genuinely cares about the berber villagers and particular the lovely family where we stopped for lunch.I would absolutely recommend this tour. Only one small thing - Adil -you need to stop smoking! We aren't smokers and we really don't like the smell. Maybe other customers are more tolerant but we found it a bit distasteful."

The family that opened their doors to us had an amazing view on their covered patio and prepared the delectable, farm-to-table meal for us.

The smells of the spices and herbs were out of this world and the abundance of fresh fruit and vegetables was great to see. I can't wait to try the ras el hanout I bought from this market.The Ourika valley was beautiful and green. Understanding the process of Argan oil and it's benefits was really interesting (but it was shame to hear that the mass seller in the UK adds other oils and takes away the Argan purity!) it was really nice to see the Argan process at the women's cooperative and that the money spent goes back to them.As we headed up the mountains, I can't say anything more than spectacular. You really get an appreciation for the natural beauty of Morocco. We also had the opportunity to pass our books and counting sticks the the Berber children.Lunch with the Berber family was out of this world. The food was delicious and coupled with the traditional seating and view made for a wonderful lunch.Adil was a fantastic guide full of knowledge and experiences. His English is perfect.

We went on the camel ride which I was very worried about as the local animals don't seem to be very well looked after, however these camels all looked healthy and happy, the 15 min ride was great the the 'camel man' took lots of photos on our camera of us while we were doing it. We then went to a local Argan oil co-op to see it being made. The prices here are quite dear, but as it's made by the locals and the money goes back to the locals we didn't mind. (There is a decent toilet to use here). The Argan peanut butter is yummy. Next we stopped by a local stream for mint tea, this was fantastic. We sat in the shade and went for a paddle. I mentioned to Adil that I wanted to try the prickly pear fruit but was unsure which are the best ones, it was a lovely surprise that he arranged for us to have some with our mint tea. Lots of locals were here too enjoying the water and having a picnic. If it's good enough for them then it's good enough for us! We then went off road up into the mountains, lots of winding roads which made our ears pop! We drove through some Berber villages and saw lots of local children, luckily I have read the reviews and had bought lots and lots of pens and pencils for them. Which we gave out while passing, my only criticism is that I felt wrong to just pass them out through the window, looking back I wish we had got out of the car and met them properly, it did seem a unfriendly way to do it. The best bit was lunch at the Berber house, wow! We had a vegetarian Tagine which was the best meal of the holiday, followed by melon and mint tea. The setting is magical, you can see for miles and we could also see and hear a thunder storm over the mountains. It's a real privilege to be welcomed into a families home like this.(There is a very clean French style toilet to use here if needed) Adil is thinking of arranging for lunch to be served as it would in the home, sitting on a rug on the floor, instead of tables and chairs, I would say that this is a great idea, and to possibly go as far as to encourage those taking part to eat with their fingers too. I'm sure that this would add to the experience as well. It was then back in the car for the decent back down the mountain. I really can't fault this experience, we learnt so much about the Atlas Mountains and the surrounding areas, the 6 hours went so fast. The cost of the tour is not nearly enough, it's about the same price as the 'Thomason'tour but so much better as it's very personalised, it was just me my husband and Adil. If you are looking for something to do, don't just book up with the holiday company guide to the Atlas Mountains, do this instead, it's a must. Enjoy. "

We drove for about an hour out of Marrakech until we arrived at the Ourika valley; here we stopped at the Berber market which was a real experience, especially the meat section with goat and cow heads all over the place. From here we got back in the car and drove about 2mins up the road where we were given the opportunity to go on a Camel ride (Something that my son had wanted to do since we decided we were going to Marrakech). We went on a half hour ride and got some lovely photos taken by the guide and all for 100dhm each. From here we drove further into the valley and stopped at an argon oil cooperative to see the women making the oil, paste and other goods. While we had stopped we popped over the river and had a glass of mint tea at the restaurant. After the tea we set off to the next Valley on a road that can only be described as a dirt track through the mountains but even though you are only a foot or two from the side of a shear drop the views make you forget about it (unless you are my wife who clung on to anything she could). Some of the views you would honestly think you were driving through the Rockies or the Alps. At about 1 O\u2019clock and at pretty much the highest point of our tour we stopped at a Berber village and went for lunch at the local Imam\u2019s house. We sat on the roof terrace and I can honestly say it was one of the most amazing places I have eaten and the food itself was lovely. As others had said it was by far the best meal we ate while in Morocco. We had tomato salad with bread to start and then chicken & vegetable Tajine and cous-cous for main before having melon and mint tea to finish. After the meal we got back in the 4x4 and set off downhill and onto Asni valley where you see all the fruit groves and orchards. We didn\u2019t stop here but you get to see everything from the car and again on the way through, the views are just incredible. We arrived back at the hotel at about 4pm. This really is a great trip and the scenery is just amazing. Also our guide, Aziz was so polite and friendly all trip and very knowledgeable and a great person to be around. If you are staying in Marrakech then this is simply a must do and for the same price as a generic group tour you can have your own personal tour of the High Atlas mountains."

His English was extremely impressive, especially considering he had just picked it up from \"life experience\". He was incredibly insightful, knowing every answer to the many questions we asked about the Atlas mountains and Morocco as a whole. Aziz was lovely to be in the company of all day. The lunch that was cooked for us in the mountains was some of the best food we ate all week, cooked for us by a 17 year old girl in her house, the family home where we ate also provided us with one of the best view points of the week, overlooking the stunning High Atlas mountains. All in all the day was just fantastic, its was so interesting learning about the different valleys, the Berber people, the Argen Oil women's cooperative and enjoying a fun camel ride, with again, a very nice camel tour guide."

Great Day Trip to escape the hustle & bustle of Djemma el Fnna & to see a little more of Marakkech. Aziz was our Guide who was very nice, spoke great English, was polite and informative. Packed so much in but never felt rushed. Visited Berber Markets, enjoyed Mint Tea whilst our feet took a dip, plus saw how Argan Oil was made & the highlight was the lunch at a Berber Family home high in the Mountains with stunning views!! Excellent day."

It was easy and straight forward and Adil confirmed that his colleague Aziz would collect us at our hotel at 9am - and he did! It was the most fantastic experience. Aziz was a great guide, he was so friendly and told us so much about Morocco and Marrakesh, it's history and the life of the people in the mountains. It was a Tuesday which was Berber market day so Aziz took us to the market which was quite an eye-opener. We also fitted a 1/2 hour camel ride in which was great fun, and I would say long enough to get a feeling of what it's like to sit on a camel. The scenery on the whole trip was amazing and Aziz often stopped so that we could take pictures. We also stopped for some lovely mint tee and visited a Women's argan oil cooperative which was really interesting, and for lunch we were taken to a Berber family where the wife of the village's Iman cooked us the most wonderful traditional meal in her house. Many thanks to Aziz for a wonderful day! (August 2014)"

            "review": "Everything that everyone else has said about 4x4 Camel is consistently true. I can't really add much more to what everyone else has said about this activity. On the day my daughter and I booked this trip, we had Yahya as our guide but we met Adil along the way as he was taking another group. We kept meeting at different points which was lovely, actually. Everything that everyone else has said about the trip, 4x4 Camel, and the guides is consistently true. They work incredibly hard to make the event very special and while you know that they do this regularly, they seem to manage to keep it very fresh. What I particularly liked though, was the warmth and desire to share the experience of their culture. My daughter, who is 17 and was experiencing her first trip out of Europe, said that she had learnt more about culture and Islam than she ever had in years If RE classes. Albeit as tourists, there was no cynicism and although while at the Women's argan oil cooperative, you are brought to the shop and shown all the products, I never felt pressurised into buying anything. I had fully intended to buy some oil in any case - my only difficulty was trying to decide what to buy! What would be useful is if they could provide a list of their products with prices when you leave, as they are willing to take orders via email but it's difficult to remember all the products.The only small point I would make is that our guide never asked us if we would like to get out and walk around at any point while driving through the mountains, and I was also hoping to visit the waterfall in the Ourika Valley that I had heard about. However, I should say that I am sure Yahya would happily have given us the opportunity to walk around had we asked. Also, as I am unfamiliar with the orientation and distances within the valley, it may well be that the tour we booked (there are a couple of options) took us in a different direction from the waterfall.This is a truly wonderful experience, and Adil is extraordinarily attentive. My advice would be to book up well in advance, because with the kind of reviews his company is getting, 4x4 is likely to become increasingly popular. The next time I return to Marrakech, I want to do the desert trip so look out for my booking Adil! I wish you and your guides continued success. You deserve it."

Doing an overnight camel tour through the Sahara definitely sounded appealing, but getting there from Marrakech would have been a challenge had we tried to do it ourselves (especially since Verizon and AT&T do not have data plans in Africa and hence no access to Google maps.) So we hired Adil, and couldn't have been more satisfied with decision. You're riding in style in a Land Cruiser, you're learning about the Moroccan landscape and culture on the way, and you're not getting lost. Most folks do this trip in three days. We asked Adil to do it in two and he obliged because in general he was willing to work with us.. but it's a lot. The man even slept in a sandstorm outside and made the 8 hr trek back the next day with no issues. He's made of iron. Definitely worth hiring and spending time with. A knowledgeable, gracious host and guide."

Adil, in excellent English, explained all about Marrakech and the Berber people. The day was truly wonderful, we stopped for mint tea, saw how argan oil is made but the absolute highlight was the meal cooked for us by the Berber family in the Atlas mountains. My friend and I are both vegetarian and the tagine and couscous that was cooked for us was out of this world, with an amazing view too boot! I thoroughly recommend Adil's day out. Our hotel also had a tour but because Adil only takes one party at a time the experience was more tailored to us and had a very special feel to it. A fabulous day out!"

I stayed in a lovely Riad in Marrakech but wanted to have a day trip out of the town - I'd booked with Adil before the trip, had really good communication, no issue with us being veggies for the food on the trip. I had a good feeling about this and wasn't disappointed. Adil arrived bang on time, my two teenage lads were having issues getting breakfast and getting ready on time (yeah, really, image that!), not an issue - take your time. Hey, I was the client and he made us feel like nothing was an issue. The car I commented on as probably being the cleanest in town - I'm thinking this gets a daily clean, another tick. We set off to the valleys having bought a bag full of sweets, school notepads, pens, marbles etc for the kids we'd encounter along the way. My 14 year old was looking forward to this part of the trip and our only regret was that we didn't bring more or bring clothes - must have seen 25 kids along the route, all really polite and it was a real pleasure giving out little treats for them. The day consisted of a camel ride for 20 mins (that was long enough) - we all loved that. We went on to the Argan oil collective and blew far too much money at the shop, travelled on and stopped at several scenic points including lunch at the Imans house in hillside village. I was a little put off by the rubbish around the village - not being snobby but you know it's a little disconcerting when you're going somewhere to eat. But aside from that, the food was plentiful and tasty, family were lovely and attentive. Adil was great fun with my boys and took us to a hillside car park on the way back to have a stone flinging competition - nice touch and I got a big thumbs up from my lads for arranging the day (which wasn't really any effort). At well under 50 quid per person including food, it was a good value day out."

Then off to the second valley we stopped on the way to give children sweets and crayons that we brought with us it was nice seeing there faces light up. We tgen stopped for lunch at a berber house they were a lovely family and it was a lovely lunch even the teens enjoyed it we had a chance to meet adil he was very friendly and helpful.

We got picked up right outside our hotel and whisked off to the two valleys. The car ride was smooth even right up to the highest point of Atlas mountains and so safe. Adil was an absolute gentleman! so lovely and chatty and knew the people and the places so well! We couldn't have asked for a better guide thank you so much! The first stop was the berber market, a traditional market which we were lucky to visit just before the end of Ramadan when it was buzzing! The people were friendly and we got to meet a traditional dentist. We drove a little further and took a camel ride over hills with amazing views, the ride was smooth, such an experience loved it! Next we hit Ourika valley which was beautiful with little huts and villages sitting on carved out terraces in the side of the mountains we took so many photos and Adil stopped at all the best photo ops! We visited a cooperative of lovely ladies which produced pure Argan oil in both cosmetic and edible form so interesting to see how its done! We traveled through the Atlas mountains stopping to take in the views. We had lunch high in the mountains in a traditional house of a lovely family the food was absolutely beautiful and we felt so well looked after by the wonderful Hariba and of course Adil. We were back at the door of our hotel that evening. This is not a run of the mill tourist tour like so many others we felt we were taken off the beaten track and really got to see Morocco. I honestly couldnt recommend a better thing to do in Marrakesh when we go back we will be booking another trip with 4x4 camel private tours!"

We were taken to a traditional Berber market and Aziz showed us around.We travelled through three different valleys stopping for a safe but exciting camel ride,mint tea by the river,a visit to a woman's co_operative where they made and sold argan oil,saw many unusual authentic mountain villages including famous ones! And the icing on the cake; lunch with the village Iman's wife who grew and cooked everything herself!! At one point in the trip you are driven off road,the part that my daughter didn't tell me as I don't do heights or hairy scary driving.I had nothing to worry about Aziz made me feel very safe,a very good experienced driver who took no unnecessary risks.All said this trip was fantastic...made the holiday,felt safe throughout ,saw authentic Morocco, ate authentic gorgeous food and it was very good value for money.Shop at the souk's by all means BUT don't leave Marrakech without taking this trip .Thank-you Aziz for a wonderful day.Dawn, Phil and daughters."

We added on camel riding to our trip which was a fantastic way to incorporate the activity on our trip agenda.

This review is long overdue but my husband and I have told several people by word-of-mouth who've booked the tour and not been disappointed.We love travelling and one of our favourite things to do is to try to experience 'local life' when we're in a new country. Whilst slowly getting used to the bustle of Marrakech we also wanted to appreciate the wider countryside and see how the Berber people of Morocco live. We were blown away by the trip with Adil (1), who took us and another British couple on a tour up into the High Atlas mountains, stopping at an argan oil co-operative on the way and culminating in lunch at a Berber home. This was by far our favourite day of the holiday - sitting on the family's terrace looking out over a small village and the mountains just beyond - absolutely incredible. The food was incredible as well.Adil was friendly, professional, knowledgeable and enthusiastic. He obviously has a great rapport with the locals and suggested beforehand we might bring along some toys/colouring books etc. from the UK for the schoolchildren. It was a delight to do so.We cannot recommend this tour highly enough and hope to visit again some day so that we can do the overnight Sahara trip!"

We were shown the cooking mounds and the animals being brought in to be sold. Which l have to say was a bit of a shock to my 12 year old who has never really thought about how it ends up on his plate! We visited a woman's co operative where Argan oil is made and sold and also stopped for mint tea in a local restaurant which we got to across a rickety bridge - all part of the fun. We visited the three valleys in the Atlas Mountains where my son gave out sweets, pens, pencils, some of his old grown out of hats (absolute must take something if you go) and tried out his French with the local Berber children. This to us was the highlight of the day. We also had the chance to have a short walk which was lovely and visited a local family to have tasty homemade food on a terrace overlooking the mountains.

On our way to the Berber village where our lunch was planned we stopped numerous times to hand out coloured pencils, markers and paper to the children that were walking to/from school. Seeing the smiles on their faces was priceless. We also took footballs that we handed out with one such stop at a village where Adil personally knew four teenagers who have grown up together. We even had the opportunity to play football with them. The chicken tagine we had for lunch was easily the best meal we had Morocco. I would recommend 4x4 Camel without reservation."

            "review": "Friendly & Knowledgeable Guide to the \"Real\" Morocco.. We were in Marrakech for a week & wanted to get to see something of the real Morocco. We found 4x4 Camel on Trip Adviser & made contact with Adil. Right from the first email he was professional & helpful, so we really looked forward to the trip. Adil picked my partner, 10 year old son & me up from our hotel promptly and even stopped off at a nearby pharmacy at my request before the tour started. We visited a typical Berber market day- nothing like the touristy Souks - a really interesting insight into local life and my son loved the \"donkey park\". Then we stopped off for a camel ride & a quick mint tea with their owner- all the camels were very clean & good natured. We then continued through the 1st valley & into the High Atlas, stopping off at a women's cooperative making Argan oil where the ladies let my son have a go at grinding the nuts. Then it was off to a local Berber village- the 4x4 was definitely needed for this! Adil was greeted by groups of children both approaching & in the village and we had some sweets and crayons with us which my son was able to hand out. He was also able to visit the village school and handed out pencils, erasers & sharpeners. It was an excellent experience for him to see how other children who aren't as fortunate as him live. We then ate our lunch on the terrace of a local family overlooking the mountains. The home made food was plentiful & delicious- and my vegetarian partner was well catered for. We headed home through the second valley in the afternoon. Again great views & good company. I would thoroughly recommend spending a day with Adil if you are visiting Morocco."

From the first email contact with Adil, I knew that my daughter and I were in safe hands and going to have a great day out.We were picked up at 9am from our Riad, by Bashir, who was to be our guide for the day.Bashir, is a highly intelligent , knowledgable , polite , funny young man. His English was superb, and he went out of his way to make sure both my daughter and I got the most out of the day and saw everything we wanted to see. And we saw a lot !! We did camel riding, we went to see how the Argan oil is made, we had mint tea on cushions on the riverside, we went to a Berber market , we met the loveliest Berber children, who were genuinely so pleased to see us and so gracious when we gave them sweets. We had a wonderful lunch in a Berber house, with amazing views and scenery. We stopped numerous times to take pictures of the Atlas Mountains and valleys. All the time we were in the car we were kept aware of where we were and the history and background of what we were looking at. The love Bashir has for his country and people really shone through, and was very infectious.A big thank you to both Adil and Bashir for what became the highlight of our far too short trip to Marrakech - we will be back :)"

This private tour for the 2 of us ladies was excellent, informative, good use of time, and covered all our priorities. We wanted a Camel ride, which he added on for us as well. We visited the Ourika and Asni Valley, visited the Berber village, had lunch there on the terrace. We wanted to see school children, so he took us to visit a school and give them some stationary, pencil cases, & supplies. We had taken some hats, clothes, candy etc which was all very appreciated. I love the fact that he makes the suggestions of what we can do, and how he helps us give to the community/village children. We visited the Argan oil Co-op as well, it was a shopping day at the Berber market - which was an interesting visit. They don't like pictures being taken, so you have to be respectful of that. All in all, it was an excellent way to spend the day (as we only had 3 days in Marrakech) and get a taste of the Morrocon life. Thank you Adil."

The guide, Bashir, was well mannered, spoke good English and had a fantastic knowledge of Morocco, the culture, history and even local laws. He also explained the Berber history, culture, lifestyle and their recent moves to improve education for their young, as well turn Berber into a unified written language.The vehicle was a new luxury Toyota land cruiser, which was very comfortable. Having the private vehicle is definitely worth it, you can stop where you want and travel at your own pace.The route was amazing with incredible views and a chance to step back in time. It is really goods that the company encourage tourists to bring books for the local school kids, it is brilliant to see a company helping the community.The meal at the Berber house, was the best I had in Morocco and is in there as one of the best meals I've ever had.I could go on and on. In short, if you need to go on a tour, talk to this company.K"

I have just returned from my wonderful day trip with Adil into the Atlas mountains.He picked us up from our hotel at 9a.m as promised in his beautiful Toyota Land Cruiser.We enjoyed a relaxing drive out to the Berber market where Adil gave us a guided tour and explained all that was taking place..... a truly amazing place that sold everything for fruit to donkey's. Upon leaving the market we headed for our camel ride which lasted a good twenty minutes which for someone who has never ridden one before was quiet enough but it was still a good experience with same lovely views to look at as you ride along. We then headed into the mountains where we stopped at the argon oil factory seeing how it made and some of the products it is used in.Next came the best parts of the trip...... The children and the wonderful meal cooked for us by Habiba.We headed up the mountain looking out on amazing views stopping frequently to take photos.After reading lots of other reviews I knew to bring sweets and school supplies for the local children. As we drove further we encountered some children so Adil stopped so we give them some sweets .We then went on to the school to give them pencils and chalk etc. all of which they are really grateful for.....I have never seen a child so grateful just to receive a pencil. Upon leaving the school we headed to Habiba's home for lunch.... you are welcomed into her home with a very warm smile and after a tour of her home you are lead out onto the terrace with the most amazing views which is where you eat lunch.The meal Habiba cooked for us was by far the best meal we had eaten all the time we were in Morocco, it started with Morrocan salad and bread followed by a chicken tagine with peppers and potatoes with couscous and vegetables, desert was melon and after we had mint tea... All of which was wonderful... I would gladly eat here everyday. After lunch we headed back down the mountains again stopping for photos along the way. The day with Adil was very special and I loved every minute and if my wife had told me in advanced I could have had a cookery lesson with Habiba learning how to cook a real Morrocan tagine I would have jumped at the chance.....oh well I guess it will have to wait until next time."

Please note, this tour may not be for everyone - especially if you're going to the traditional berber market - keep in mind this is Moroccan culture and may be vastly different from ours so it was wise for us to keep an open mind. We purchased the most delicious watermelon from the market! Adil was super prompt and picked us up at our desired meeting point. Adil was nice and explained our itinerary and answered questions we had. We visited an argan oil co op, as everyone else does and I found the prices to be quite reasonable for the quality. I'm a female and have purchased organic Argan oil online for many years..not the big name products but small crops, and found this to be high quality at the co op. I just wish the girl showing us had more enthusiasm, we could tell she had done the same song and dance hundreds of times and it was depressing. She spoke impeccable English. Since I've already used up half of my bottle (it was only 4 days ago) I wish I had purchased more oil to be honest. :) Expect 200dh for an Advil sized bottle (I think it was 120ml? but don't quote me!) I purchased some from the co op and from a reputable vendor back in Marrakech and I much prefer the co op. Anyway..the views were fantastic and the berber lunch was amazing. I donated most of my clothes to the young girls (I wish I had more for the boys) and we had colored pencils. When one of the children acted out of line (undoubtedly wanting more than colored pencils), Adil stopped the car to talk to him about it. The camel ride was terrifying and I probably would skip that..I ride horses but these camels were tripping over themselves, just scary. I got incredibly car sick, so I wouldn't recommend going without proper medicine. Adil did an awesome job of driving slow and stopping when needed. As others have stated, the ride home was quiet and we were wiped out. It was a nice day overall."

I wish we could have bought and brought more things for the Berber village kids. We would strongly recommend that you bring some stationary or sweets for the children. If you don't want to carry them from your home country buy them from Marrakesh.

We took colouring books, pencils and bouncy balls and the children seemed delighted (the most humbling part of my trip to Morocco), the boys really want footballs, and in hindsight, I wish I'd bought some in the main square to take with me (the ground is very rocky and the kids love football but they burst quite easily).

We drove to a local Berber market (which was on a Tuesday morning), here we got to see an array of different things and we saw how some Moroccans really live which was fascinating. There was then a chance for us to see some camels and ride them, after this we began driving up the mountains where we visited an argan oil co-operative which was really interesting, the only downside is that the shop was a bit expensive but there is no pressure to buy anything. After this we drove up the mountain where we got to stop and take photos, the views were amazing! We stopped off to buys sweets for the children which we gave to them as we saw them in the mountains, they were all so lovely and thankful.Finally our last stop was at a Berber house where we had a genuine Berber lunch in a family home, the views from the house were stunning and it was by far the best food we had eaten whilst in Morocco (even when we'd been to some pretty expensive/recommended restaurants!). Adil then drove us back to Marrakech and delivered us safely back to our hotel by 4pm!Adil was an excellent tour guide and the experience was very interesting and easy.

I contacted Adil via email from the UK with a request for a private tour (myself and my wife) and detailed email responses came back quickly. Picked up from our riad in a large, new 4X4. Adil was very informative during the drive and we learned much about Moroccan culture, modern lifestyle, Islam, the Berbers and anything else we could think to ask. We enjoyed the drive and stops along the way and the lunch at the Berber home was very good. We had purchased small color pencil packs with a dozen pencils each and brought out two dozen to give out to the local Berber kids which was much appreciated.We always arrange for local private tour and guide wherever we visit which can be hit or miss but I would highly recommend Adil and his company if you would like to get out of Marrakech for the day."

            "review": "An unforgettable experience. We booked a day trip with Adil after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor. He picked us up at our Riad by 9am, and we went to the Berber market (a local wet market). Then to the argan oil co-operative, the products are expensive but not forced to buy anything. We took sweets, books, pens and crayons for the children of berber villages. We were so happy to meet the children and to see their smile faces. It's main reason we booked this tour. After meeting the children we had a lovely home cooking lunch in berber village. If we'd say a negative point is the tour ended with fairly quite, 2hrs drive back to Marrakech by 16:00. And also, it'd be cost effective if you'd join other people in this tour as paid 170 euro for 2 persons including lunch for only 7hrs (including nearly 4hrs in driving). Overall, Adil seems to care the children of berber villages, which we think is admirable and very respectful. It's a great opportunity to experience the meaning of different life."

Adil was a great host - very informative and friendly, as he drove us towards the Atlas mountains. We had a great day seeing the high peaks, spending time at the Berber market, and to top it all off, a delicious homemade lunch in the house of a lovely Berber woman. And as Adil knew it was my partner's birthday he'd arranged for a cake. It was lovely to see him blowing out the candles with the Atlas mountains as a backdrop.I have previously done other Atlas mountain tours that focus on the more touristy Ourika valley, and the difference with this tour is that Adil takes you a bit off the beaten track so you get a more authentic and peaceful tour. I would highly recommend Adil and 4x4 camel!"

Everything about the trip was excellent and I really can't recommend it highly enough. Adil is fun and informative and takes you to see a side of Morrocan life that you simply would not be able to visit on your own. I particularly want to mention the lunch we had in the Berger village, as the food and views were simply sensational. If you have any flexibility on your travel dates, I'd recommend to try and take the tour on a Saturday, so that you are also able to visit the weekly Berger Market (another amazing experience)."

First, we went to the Ourika valley, excited for the tour. There Adil took us to the berber market made every monday on the valley which was so authentic and they had everything you could imagine from goats to hairdressers to natural viks vaporub to second hand clothes or even mobile phones! Everything was so cheap! We had so much fun and afterwards we were heading to the Argan oil cooperative. At the cooperative we met the women who make the oil and which is then transforms into a great variety of products like honey, and the best facial creams in the world in my opinion. We met Malika who spoke Spanish better than some Spanish people hahah she was fascinating. Also, we made the camel ride for like 20 minutes or so and the berbers were so kind and polite to us we were very comfortable. Last but not least we were heading to the Atlas mountains to the berber village to have lunch there at the house of a family who has this wonderful relation with Adil. We ate better than any place we tried in Marrakech and the views were breathtaking. Really, the best trip I have ever done in a foreign country and only in one day! On the way back to the riad 2 of us were already sleeping in the car but we were having real talk with Adil, I wish him the best I think this could not be better organized he knows what he does. 100% Recommendable. If you know how to take the best out of life experiences you will not regret a trip like this and I will sure repeat when I return to Marrakech someday."

Had prepared a little snack with cookies and a bottle of water for each in the car (clean, good car). Adil has great knowledge about most things and are glad to share and answer questions. Fun camel ride! Not very long, but in a relaxing, safe enviroment Stopped at the Berber marked, which unfortunately was closed due to bad weather, but still an interesting sight. Had the traditional tea at a restaurant.The Argan Oil Company was interesting to see, but extremely overpriced. Left a small donation instead of buying anything. There was a blizzard in the mountains when we went in late January, wich was an amazing sight! Hip high snow everywhere (and thank Heaven for our skilled driver, who got us safely through the snow covered, winding roads of the Atlas mountains ;P ). Even had a snowball fight when we made a stop for photographs!We ate inside at the Berber families house. Food galore and of really good quality! Tasted sooo, so good!Adil was a great tour guide the entire trip and such a nice person - easy to talk to and very open hearted and -minded. He explained many cultural things for us and was a good conversational partner.The 4x4 Camel Tour is more expensive than so many other trips you can buy of the street in Marrakech (we booked ours from home), but it is easily worth the extra money, since the company is very professional, welcoming and organised. Although Morrocans are a nice in general, many tries to cheat you if you look wealthy (being a group of four tall, blonde, young people does that trick) and it was such a welcome not to be hassled for an entire day, when we were on the tour. Adil was honest and just for his company, our little group of Scandinavian students will warmly recommend 4x4 Camel Tour."

            "review": "Fabulous day...worth every penny. We contacted Adil at short notice but he was able to provide his colleague Aziz (I think, sorry if I've got name wrong). My daughter and I were picked up promptly near our riad. We went first to a Berber market on the outskirts of Marrakech. The first part was like a car boot sale, but then we were shown the donkey carpark, the hay and straw market, the meat market, the veg market, the restaurant area and the fascinating dentist/barber area. It was very muddy, so Aziz was a bit concerned that we were happy to go, and also checked we weren't squeamish at the meat. We were driven up some pretty rough roads in the mountains, that I wouldn't have liked to try driving on myself, and were able to stop for photos whenever we liked. We saw many children and gave them small gifts, but were unable to visit the school as the children were not in..I think it being a Friday. The visit to the Argan oil coop was, as others have said, interesting but products were expensive and quite difficult not to make a purchase. However, I hope the coop does benefit the divorced/single women who run it. The lunch was wonderful; such a good lunch with that amazing view in a Berber house high in the mountains. After lunch Aziz showed us the traditional way to make mint tea. We enjoyed our camel ride, which led us across open ground where a girl was goat herding, towards the mountains and back by a small stream. It seemed longer than the time stated for 10euro each and, although near the road, we seemed to get out into countryside. Aziz spoke perfect English and told us much interesting information as we travelled. If you're going to splash out on this type of excursion then I don't think you could do better than 4x4camel. Enjoy!"

            "review": "A welcome respite from the Medina's chaos.. We booked our trip in advance since New Years is such a high season in Morocco and Adil, our tourguide, was very accomodating during the booking process. We decided to do the Atlas Mountain/2 Valley tour with the traditional Berber lunch at the summit. He picked us up on Monday morning, which turned out to be perfect since the region's weekly market is held on Mondays. Throughout the tour, Adil was very flexible and accomodating - my buddy was carsick the entire ride up, so we stopped often. Instead of going to the usual Argon Oil Cooperative, we stopped at a rug coop and Adil served as our advisor in strategizing for a great deal on the rugs. We also made an unplanned stop at a roadside artist's studio when some of his scrap metal sculptures caught our eye. Adil was so accommodating, in fact, that after the tour was complete, he arranged for us to meet back up with the artist near an ATM so we could purchase one of the sculptures. We also took the camel ride, which was surprisingly inexpensive, yet lengthy enough to be worthwile (hope for an adult to escort your camels - we had a young boy with a short stride and were forced to go at his pace). We brought school supplies and candy for the children, who recognize Adil's SUV and come running as we pass through their villages. He really has an amazing heart for the people and has cultivated relationships with many of the children and their parents along the route. In my opinion, tangible goods would be more meaningful than candy was - these kids need winter clothes and typical school supplies. Adil had extra beanies and socks in his trunk when we ran out of gifts so that the kids closer to the end of the route wouldn't be disappointed. Once we arrived at the Berber family's home, we were given a quick tour and then escorted onto a sun-soaked deck with fantastic views of the village and mountains. Our hostess served Tagine and couscous that could not have been more fresh or more flavorful. We stayed less than an hour and then headed back down to Marrakech. I can't tell you how that part went since we both fell asleep, but I can tell you that the entire day (about 8 hours) was an absolute blast. Adil is easy to converse with and really good company; we've actually stayed in touch a bit since our visit last month. Book the trip - you'll be glad you did."

            "review": "Customized to Perfection. My husband, 3 year old daughter, and I did two tours with 4x4 Camel over the past week. We originally planned on a trip to the Atlas Mountains on Sunday followed by a Monday half day tour to some of the Marrakesh highlights, but when Bashir (sp?) met us on Sunday, he recommended that we switch days due to rain. We took his advice, and had the time of our lives.Bashir's English was great, his driving was perfect, he was laid back but efficient, and shared fascinating details about Morocco's history, culture, religions, and even his own upbringing. When he found out that our little girl was really into animals, he ensured that during the two days we spent together she met, rode, and/or pet camels, sheep, goats, mules, donkeys, and cats. He really charmed her and she happily let him carry her around as we toured.We brought some clothes and other gifts for the kids in a village in the mountains, and Bashir helped our daughter distribute them. It was a great learning experience followed by a hearty lunch prepared by a Berber family. We loved every minute.It's worth mention that within Marakesh (i.e. on the city tour), 4x4 Camel doesn't enter the sites, and they advised me of that well in advance when I was booking the tour. Instead, Bashir helped us identify what interested us (he made recommendations and gave us options), took us there, got us situated to enter, and then waited for us to come back out. For us, this was ideal because if our daughter lost interest, we could move on at our own pace and there wasn't a lot of \"boring grown up talk,\" but if you want someone narrating everything, you might want to use a different company within the city. Some tips if you go on the mountain tour at this time of year (January): Bring some layers and old shoes. It was not freezing (at least not compared to the East Coast of the US), but it's pretty chilly inside the Berber house and layers were more comfortable than a huge bulky coat. The village market was a complete sheet of mud - like the kind of mud that tries to suck your shoes off your feet as you walk. There is no avoiding it, and we had to spend time cleaning mud off the soles, sides, and even tops of our shoes when we returned to our riad (hotel). Oh, and don't be surprised that the bathrooms are squat toilets during the mountain tour. My husband and I have lived in a country where squat toilets were pretty standard so we were used to them, but I do understand that some people who have never used them before might be taken off guard without a heads up. In truth, I find them cleaner than rural public sit down toilets, but intelligent minds can disagree :-)We highly recommend this company, especially if you are traveling with young children or toddlers. It's the customization that made it so special, and we really liked being able to lock into the two tours in advance, but then tailor our day as we went rather than having to commit to a rigid schedule way in advance. Thank you to Bashir and 4x4 Camel for showing us such a great time around Marrakesh!"

You've likely all been on tours that consist of a series of stops at the guide's favourite shops. Our tour was exactly as advertised and we were able to take in the beautiful scenery of the Ourika Valley (including a nice 20 minute camel-borne circuit) and an informative visit to a women's Argan oil co-op. We skipped the offer of tea and headed straight towards our next stop via very picturesque low traffic roads that let us take in the breathtaking scenery. Shortly after our turn off the main road, we were dropped off for an easy 30 minute walk that let us take in views of several small villages before Adil picked us up further down the road. We stopped several times along the road to give children some of the small gifts of school supplies and balloons that we had brought for them. It's wonderful to see the rapport that Adil has established with these normally shy children and to see their bright smiles as they got a pen or a copy book. A high point of the day came, as many have said, when we stopped in a small berber village within the Toubkal National Park for lunch. Adil has had a relaionship with this particular family since 2009. Their home is simple but impeccable. Our lunch consisted of (chick pea?) soup, a chicken tajine, a vegetable couscous, Moroccan tea and local apples - all delicious! Along our way home, we stopped at a lively Berber market that was selling mostly vegetables. All in all a very interesting and informative day guided by a very personable Adil."

We are keen on our pictures so he took us to some amazing spots to photograph.The Berber market was great to see, completely different to the medina.The camel ride was in such a great location in the mountains, not like all the other roadside ones we had seen everywhere.The mountains were stunning!The argan oil factory was a bit of a sales gimmick in my opinion but the other half was happy with her purchase and it didnt take long.The meal and stop in the berber house was sublime and the views are out of this world!If you are planning on booking with Adil then be sure to take plenty of little gifts like sweets, crayons and colouring in bits to hand out to the local kids. The smiles on their faces for such a small gift gives such an uplifting feeling. We just spent about \u00a38 in poundland before we went. If you are able to take a cheap football then the big groups of boys will love you, I wish I would have thought of it!Adil is also very trustworthy and very willing to take photos for you, which was great for me and my girlfriend so we could get some pictures of us in the stunning surroundings.To sum it all up, Adil's tour is something you MUST do if you are planning a trip to Morocco. We loved it and looking through the pictures gives us such a great feeling. We would not hesitate to book again.Thank you Adil"

As with the other reviews, we thought the trip was worth the price paid (\u20ac60pp). We also opted for the additional camel ride for \u20ac10 which was a good experience. The highlight was the drive around the Atlas Mountains where we stopped numerous times to hand out coloured pens to children Adil personally knew. We brought a tub of 100 coloured pens and gave them to some 80+ children along the way - some reviews mentioned not seeing children, but perhaps it was because it is currently school holidays so there were many children around.Lunch at a Berber family's home was wonderful - we had chicken tagine on their terrace. It was a very rural setting and a stark contrast to Marrakech and also where we normally live. We had plenty of time to relax and enjoy the peaceful place.Adil was knowledgeable and although we visited an Argan cooperative, it was not touristy or pushy. We learnt about the extraction process of the oil from the Argan nut. We did buy some Argan oil but there was no hard sell at all. Adil also met us at our riad and was punctual."

We were picked up promptly from the Riad in his brand new car which contained bottled water and biscuits for us which was very thoughtful. The first stop was the Berber market, through which he guided us with a fascinating commentary on what was happening. After this we headed up to the mountains and rode camels for 20 mins which was a fun experience/photo opportunity! We then visited an Argan oil cooperative which was interesting if pricey and finished up having lunch in a local Berber village. We had come equipped with sweets and pens for the kids and it was lovely to see them talking with Adil. The meal was delicious and was enjoyed on the terrace with stunning views of the mountains. The meal culminated in a 'tutorial' (and tasting of) mint tea before we wound our way back to Marrakech. Throughout the day it was great to chat to Adil about life in Morocco and gain an insight into the 'real' country rather than the more touristy and intense feeling of Marrakech itself. Adil was friendly, professional and made sure our day was action packed, relaxed and varied. Very many thanks!"

He took us to the real life Berber villages and see things that you wouldnt normally with a tour trip. It was lovely to see the children coming up to Adil's car and being happy to receive a sweet or two. We had lunch at a local house which was the best food I tasted in Marrakech (I was a bit worried before hand as you hear many stories of people getting ill but there was nothing to worry about! it was very clean and nice and the view we had was fantastic.) Marrakech city is lovely but its not real, theres too much tourism. It was nice to get away from that and see the real life."

We were picked up at our Riad in the city and taken off to the first stop which was the Berber Market. This was a fascinating place, even if the weather was a little inclement at the time. Its such an odd experience for us Europeans to see a market entirely populated by men. We then moved off up to the high Atlas and on to the school. I had taken a lot of school things (books, pens, pencils etc. etc.) The school had no power, no heating no nothing very much, so the things i took were well received. My advice is take as much as you can, and also take warm clothes for young children - the children here have very little.From the school, off to a Berber home for lunch. Warning, go prepared for an enormous amount of truly delicious food - best tagine and couscous I ate in Morocco. Then it was a slow drive back to Marrakech.Throughout the trip Adil was a great host/guide. He pointed out all the things of interest and answered all of our questions. It was a great day and I highly recommend it. Oh, and we had a short camel ride as well!"

We did the two valleys day with Adil, which included a visit to a Berber market, the Argan oil cooperative and a meal in a Berber family house in the Atlas mountains. This was the highlight of our visit to Marrakech - it was great to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city to sample the more peaceful surroundings in the Atlas mountains. Adil was an excellent guide and could not have been more helpful. We arranged the trip by email from the UK on the recommendation of friends and we were not disappointed. We had taken some sweets, pencils and notebooks for the Berber children and it was a delight to see the expressions on their faces when we gave them these small gifts. The meal in the family house was one of the best we had during our stay - more tasty than some of the bland offerings in the city - and the views from the terrace were breathtaking. Our only wish is that the trip could have been longer. Thanks again to Adil for a wonderful day."

He didnt ask for any payment until the day of the trip, so no fiddling about with paypal ! We chose to do the Berber villages trip which included a trip to a Berber market which was fascinating. Adils English is very good and he gave us loads of information as we drove along in his comfortable 4x4 car. We were supplied with water and snacks free of charge during the journey. We visited an Argon oil factory, lots of lovely things to buy and no pressure to buy if you don't want to. We opted for a camel trek, which was great. The camel rides in Marrakech just walk you around a field on the outskirts of the city, but this trip we were taken up the little paths above the village we were at and there was just the two of us and the guide, so it was very quiet and peaceful. I would def recommend doing this.We had a fun off road trip up to the Berber villages to a house where the lady cooked us a fabulous lunch, in fact it was the best chicken tagine of the holiday and sitting overlooking the Atlas Mountains was wonderful.The Berber people are VERY poor, and after reading other people comments we decided to take a big box of celebrations sweets to hand out. (We didn't take jelly sweets cos they have gelatine in them , not suitable for Muslim children) Adil gave one sweet to each child and they seemed delighted with their treat. We also bought lots of woolly hats and gloves as the mountains get very cold in winter. Def recommend this trip to see the real Morocco."

            "review": "Day trip out of Marrakech. We used 4x4 Camel for a day trip out of Marrakech as well as for airport pickup/drop off on a recent trip to Morocco. Adil was very easy to coordinate with vai email prior to our trip and we felt like we were well taken care druing our time with him and his company.What we did:We selected what we wanted to do on our day trip based on the reviews on TA and suggestions from Adil. Our planned itinerary (which sounds typical of a lot of day trips with Adil) was to leave from the hotel, head into the Atlas mountains, visit a Berber market, visit a Moroccan oil cooperative, have lunch at a Berber home, and stop at a Berber school to hand out some school supplies before heading back into Marrakech with an expected trip time to be 4 to 6 hours. Based on the conversations I had via email with Adil we choose to bring some school supplies with us and purchased some candy for the kids once we got into Marrakech. This is something that certainly wasn\u2019t required but my family wanted to interact with the local Berber population as much as we could to get a better idea what it was like to live in Morocco. There certainly wasn\u2019t any pressure to bring these items and I feel like if we hadn\u2019t it would not have even been brought up once were in the 4x4 and under way.Adil picked up us promptly at 9 am and we were on our way. He had bottled water and some snacks in the vehicle which was a nice touch. Our first stop was at a local Berber market which was a far different from the big market in Marrakech. This one was more of a farmer\u2019s market where all of the local population would go to get the things/food they needed for the coming week. It was very interesting and well worth the stop. I think we ended up spending about 30 mintues of so here.We then headed further into the mountains where we stopped at an Argan Oil cooperative run by local women who derive all of their income from the production of this salad/hair/body oil. This stop was fine as we learned a bit about the labor intensive process used to produce the oil. We then had the opportunity to try some samples and purchase some of the products. This was fine although the oil products were rather expensive and maybe for the quality it is worth it but as a man, I didn't necessarily see the value (but I'm told it was good stuff). After leaving the oil cooperative, we went off road up into the mountains where we had the opportunity to take some pictures (it is beautiful!) and see several villages on the way to where we were going to have lunch. Along the way we started seeing childen running towards our vehicle. Adil has a pretty good reputation with the locals and the kids have gotten used to getting a candy or two when he passes through (hence the mention of candy above). The kids we interacted with were all very polite and genuinely happy to see us. I think we handed out several bags of candy (almost like reverse halloween trick or treating in the states).Lunch was the best meal we had during our time in Morocco. Adil has an agreement with a Berber family to provide a traditional meal and everything was very good. This meal consisted of tangine cooked chicken, veggies, couscous, bread, and fruit. The meal was served in a Berber house on the patio overlooking a beautiful valley. The only thing I would have changed for this part of the day would have been to interact more with the Berber family. As it was, we were alone on the patio and the family members would bring out the various food times to us which was fine but we got more of a sense of being in a restaurant than being in someones home.After lunch, we started to head back to Marrakech with a couple of more photo stops along the way. The trip back was along a different route than the one we took out of town in the morning so we really got see a lot of the countryside which was very nice. For some reason, and I'm not sure why even now, but we did not stop at the school to hand out the school supplies we brought with us. We assumed (obviously incorrectly) that we would be doing that after lunch but by the time we realized were out of the mountains and back into the outskirts of Marrakech it was too late to have turned around. My wife and kids were disappointed that we were unable to do this as they were looking forward to it. Adil did say that he would make sure that the items would be given to the school the next time he was near there. Overall this was a very good experience and not one you could have if you stay in the city. The differences between the Berber people and metropolitan folks in town is quite striking. Also, Adil is a good host and has obviously worked to develop relationships with the locals and that showed in the smiles of the children when we drove by. I would recommend this trip as a part of your time in Morocco."

Adil was a great tour guide, very chatty and interesting, and showed us the best parts of the Atlas mountains. Instead of just going to the Ourika/Asni valleys like many of the group tours, we were taken high into the mountains for some amazing views. Lunch at the berber family house was delicious (best food of the trip) and not to be missed! Adil also arranged a birthday cake for my boyfriend's birthday!We also asked to do a walk which, although quite scary, was amazing and we had great views of one of the waterfalls! This turned out to be my favourite part of the day.The whole day went very smoothly as we were picked up and dropped off at our riad.Don't hestitate, book now, you won't regret it."

            "review": "Unique and unforgettable adventure. If you only had 2 days in Marrakech - make sure that you spend at least 1 day doing this trip out to the Atlas Mountains.You can read the rest of the reviews and we would happily echo everything positive that has already been said. But we would like to add, that without question, it would not be possible to experience all of the sights, sounds, tastes and smiles that we did, without the expert guidance of Ya Ya - our guide. As with other reviewers, all email communication in advance with Adil was both prompt, informative and helpful. On the morning, an immaculately presented, safe and modern Toyota Landcruiser was at our riad early, which meant that we too were early to depart on our adventure. Within the space of a few hours, we had left the flat and baron surroundings of Marrakech and were climbing into the unique and ever changing landscape of the Atlas Mountains. A short stop for a camel ride and some photos, followed by a visit to learn more about the production of Argan Oil at a local co-operative (which we had a go to experience how hard this process really is) and then at the end of the first road for a short trek to waterfalls at Siti Fatma - all along with the friendly approach and fluent English of our guide.From the waterfalls (where some other tours turn back to Marrakech), we continued into the Atlas Mountains further, stopping along the way for photos and also to share some gifts with the local children (sweets, pencils, pens, colouring books, balloons) - every one of them polite, gracious and thankful, even for the smallest of items. Next stop, after winding our way through the mountains, was a private lunch in a Berber Village, cooked by some locals and sharing a delicious salad, tagine and cous cous, followed by fruit and fresh tea. An experience of a lifetime.Throughout our journey, there was a clear respect for our guide amongst the other locals that we interacted with. The camel herders were friendly and always with a smile, the explanation at the Argan Oil co-operative was good and our trek guide, Jamal, was like a mountain goat himself, but always ready to lend a hand on the climb or suggest or take a photo along the way.We did spend some money along the journey, in addition to the standard fee for the day. We paid extra for the camel ride, we purchased some Argan Oil products, we paid our waterfall guide and purchased some stone carved items on the waterfall trek. The best part, even after some haggling, was that we were making a contribution to the communities that we visited; communities that were not pushy or sales hungry. And at no point in our tour, did our guide push a sale on us. Highlights for the day - if we had to narrow them down - certainly our lunch in a private Berber Village home and interaction with the local children. But overall, the entire experience and 8 hours from start to finish was professional, unique, memorable and an unforgettable adventure. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

Adil arrived early to pick us up at our riad in the heart of the souks. He was crisp in appearance, articulate with perfect English, his vehicle was immaculate with water and snacks (for purchase). Our trip was as we had arranged and included the obligatory camel ride for my benefit. We stopped at a carpet place, Aragon oil women's cooperative, drove into the Atlas mountains, had a Berber lunch and began our trip with a visit to a local market. Adil was well known by the vendors and seemed respected. He stick-handled persistent vendors for us when it was clear they would not leave us alone. Most outstanding for us was along our tour through the mountains, we would stop and children would run up to our vehicle. Adil would always give the children something, money, cookies whatever he had in the car. He has a clear relationship with the Berber family that provided us lunch that he has chosen for its cleanliness. The family has benefited from his stops by Adil providing them with a fridge and other small amenities over the years. The lunch, by the way, was amazing. All in all, a distinct highlight of our Moroccan trip. A note for this day trip, bring small change for tips and plan to bring deflated soccer balls or school supplies for the children. They will be very much appreciated. Adil's fee for the day is very reasonable. I highly recommend this small company and wouldn't hesitate to use 4x4 Camel again."

I just wanted to add another glowing and positive review. This truly was an amazing day for us, and the highlight of a short break in Marrakech. Adil was a wonderful guide and as a party of two females we felt totally safe in his care, happily wondering off alone up a mountain leaving all our possessions in his immaculate land rover and trusting him when he said he'd pick us up in 15 minutes!The argan oil co-operative was expensive (around \u00a320 ish for small bottle of oil for face/hair, but worth it.) The meal in the Berber family's house was delicious and we felt very privileged to be guests in their home. The local children were wonderful, but do ask Adil for guidance as to what to bring. Our day trip coincided with a school holiday and we must have met more than 100 children. We really wished we'd spent a few more pounds on more sweets as we could only give them one each. The felt tip pens and crayons were also appreciated. A wonderful day, worth every penny. Thank you Adil!"

I did have some reservations initially, as this wasn't the first day trip I've booked that has rave reviews and I've merely found the service good, if nothing spectacular. So we contacted Adil and arranged a price, after a bit of bartering which seems to be the Moroccan thing and set a date.As the rating suggests, there was no need for any scepticism. Adil was a great host, very friendly and talkative despite not being too well at the time, and a very good driver. Our needs were taken into account, and we got to go for a hike around the waterfalls, going at a time when it was less busy. The scenery and views are great, but what was the highlight for me was the lunch at the Berber house. Again I wasn't expecting much but it turned into the best meal I had during our stay, and this includes eating at some decent restaurants in Marrakech rated quite highly on here and in the guide books. Also what was clearly evident is that Adil clearly cares for the people in this region, stopping briefly once or twice to speak with them and exchange gifts, something he'll tell you about and share with you. It's a heartwarming touch you'd be hard pressed to find with many other guides. As other reviewers mention, do bring some gifts with you for the local children (pencils, pens, paints sets etc), just mention to Adil beforehand if you have as he won't ask you during the trip, it is entirely your choice (but you'll be glad you did).At the end of the tour we ended up paying Adil the original amount he quoted, it was worth every penny.One bit of advice is if you do ask to hike around the waterfalls, do wear sensible footwear, as it is a bit of a scrabble up and down at times, with some of the rocks wet - you won't want to be doing this in flip-flops or high heeled shoes, as many tourists seemed to be!"

The day started with Adil collecting us from our hotel at 9am and driving to the mountains, stopping at a Berber market on the way. In the car Adil gave us background and information about the day as well as taking an interest in us and our experience in Marrakech. The Berber market was great to see, really unusual, we were lucky as I believe it is only on certain days of the week. We stopped to do the camel ride which we recommend doing, it was a bit scary at first as the camel stood up but when you get used to it it is really peaceful and enjoyable. We drove into the mountains and Adil pointed out things of interest and gave informative facts about the area and the people. Adil let us walk for about 30 minutes to enjoy the views ourselves before picking us up again. We had lunch in a Berber house which was just amazing! I am vegetarian and was fully catered for. We had tagines, cous cous, salad and bread and the lady who owned the house and cooked was lovely!! Her house was spotlessly clean and tidy. We also stopped at a place that made Argan oil products which was interesting, a good taste demonstration and then chance to browse and buy. The tour ended with Adil dropping us off to our hotel around 4.30pm ish. We can\u2019t recommend this tour enough, Adil has the perfect personality and attitude to run this business, he was polite, informative, knowledgeable and friendly and displayed perfect customer service.

Thank you to all the 4x4 crew (the mint tea demonstration was another special moment :))."

He was at our hotel waiting for us at the appointed time and took us straight to a Berber market, what an eye opener, you have to see it to believe it.Yahya took us around the market showing us all the items for sale some that you would never see in England.The next stop was for us to try and buy a tea light but as there wasn't one that I liked and Yahya spoke to the sellers and we were not given any hassle.Then it was off to the camels, we didn't actually have a ride but they did allow us to sit on them and for us to have our picture taken even though my camel had attitude and kept moving.Then it was off to Argan oil cooperative. This was again an eye opener as they do all the work by hand. The lady that shows you around speaks very good English.You can also try the oils for eating and the oils for the skin and hair.The price is high but when you think that you have 100% Argan oil not mixed with any other chemicals and the money doe's go to a good cause.After this we drove through the mountains on roads that didn't look wide enough but Yahya was a confident driver ( I was just glad no-one came the other way).As the car approached the villages the children were already waiting or came running from their houses.We gave them sweets and the smiles were all the reward you needed.The way they live is unbelievable but they seem happy.Then it was off for lunch in the Berber families house for lunch and what a meal.It was the best meal we had all the holiday.First it was a salad of tomatoes with onions and coriander served with freshly made bread and olive oil.Then it was a chicken tagine served with cous cous and yet more bread, next we had apples picked straight from the trees and they were fantastic.Then Yahya showed us how to make mint tea.I never realized it took so long.You do have to pay the family 200 dirhams directly.We were then driven back to Marrakech through the Atlas mountains with Yahya answering our many questions and was always smiling and happy.You do not have to pay any money until you get back to the hotel.(it is best to pay in Moroccan money but they do accept euros).We spent a fantastic day seeing the other side of Marrkech.So all in all I would like to say a BIG thank you to both Adil and Yahya.If you want a good day out then book though this company, sit back and relax."

We chose to book a trip with Adil after reading all the great reviews on here and we were certainly not disappointed. He picked us up from our hotel on time and drove us firstly to the berber market. This was probably the highlight of my day, as it was very authentic and so different to any other market I had visited before. Adil was very knowledgeable about the market and all the products and so was able to talk us through the traditions and the products as we walked around. The next stop was a camel ride, which was so fun and the people who took us on the walk were lovely and took so many photos of us with my camera! We then visited the Argan co-operative, this was really interesting to see and the ladies who worked there and showed you around were so friendly and helpful and we didn't feel pressured into buying anything, even though we did all end up buying something from there. After this we drove higher into the mountains and as Adil's car drove closer to the villages you could see all the children running up the hills to see him. Luckily we were equipped with lots of pencils and sweets as there were so many children! We then had lunch at the Berber family's house, which was incredible. They were so friendly and cooked the most amazing food and the backdrop whilst eating was beautiful - I would definitely recommend eating here! I would 100% recommend this trip to anyone, Adil was a great driver and we felt completely safe the whole day. He knows so much about the mountains and Morocco and was happy answering all the questions I had for him. Thanks so much again and I will definitely be booking another trip with you when I return!"

            "review": "Amazing Day !. What can i say, the day was amazing, Adil was an excellent host & certainly knows how to make the day special. He arrived at our hotel on time to take us off into the Atlas Mountains, an area he obviously loves and knows so well. On the way he was constantly answering questions that we were asking about life in Marrakech and what an average day was like for the local people. On the way up into the mountains we stopped off to ride a camel, Adil again thought of everything as he had sun hats in the car in case we'd forgot our own. The camel ride was fun and was well worth doing, we were only on the camel for 30mins but believe me that is long enough,especially when your in shorts & the sun is so hot, we were all glad to get back to the air conditioned car ! Next we visited the Argan oil co-operative and watched the ladies making the oil, from shelling the nuts to the finished product, we took some amazing photos of our family on the production line, but none of us got the job ! Next we went into the shop where we learnt about the different products that it can be made into, needless to say we bought most ! Then it was time to head into the mountains where we were due to stop for lunch, but on route we stopped at local villages & handed out gifts to the children who were so grateful. This was so sad, seeing these children happy to receive a pen and a notebook when teenagers in our country expect the latest xbox game, maybe we should do a exchange scheme for a month ! All i can say is take gifts, lots of them, these children really don't get much but thanks to Adil, they get more than some & they can spot him from a distance,even to the point of running when they see his car. Lunch in the family house was very good (lots of it) & again it was so nice to meet the local people who Adil has helped, i dont think i will ever eat a meal with such a beautiful view again. We returned to the car to continue our tour of the mountains, stopping to take lots of photos on the way, Adil even drove off when i suggested leaving one of our party at the roadside, the look of fear in her face was a picture, it made a change to see a lady running up to the car instead of children ! It was soon time to head back to the hustle of Marrakech & leave the beautiful mountains, but we will return the next time we are in Morocco, with more gifts. Adil made our fantastic day so special, to him i must say \"thank you\", book this tour you will not be disappointed ."

Even though this wasn't something Adil usually does he arranged it for us and it was amazing, I would thoroughly recommend it. The guide was brilliant too.The sights are fantastic and it gives you an insight into the real Morocco. Lunch at the Berber home was delicious and I have never eaten anywhere with such extraordinary 360 degree views. If you're thinking about going, then do it! Well worth the money."

So glad we booked it up with him as it was the best trip ever. Adil picked us up first thing and then we went to a local Berber market. This I thought was the best bit about the trip as I did not know what to expect. Did not get hassled as there were only locals shopping so no souvenir in the market. There were cattle being sold, spices being sold and absolutely anything being sold!! Also men being shaved (it was equivalent to a barber in the market). No women around. We then went to the Argan Oil Corporation where the pure argan oil is made. Went mad and bought loads. Spent quite a bit in there although the bottles of argan oil are big and you know its the real stuff. After went to a lovely Berber house in the Atlas mountains where we were made to feel at home. They were lovely and fed us really well. We struggled to eat everything. The trip round the Atlas mountains were lovely. Definately worth booking with Adil as he speaks perfect English and what a host."

By our request, Adil met us the morning of our tour in a location near our Riad which was easy for both of us.Our first stop was the Berber Market which was absolutely amazing to walk though. Very real experience and obviously not a typical tourist stop as I felt we were the only tourists passing through. This was a great eye opener to start the day. Adil was very informative and explained all about the Berber Market while we were there. Second stop was for the camel ride! We stopped on our way heading into the mountains. I was pleased that the camels appeared very healthy and were very well taken care of. Our guide took us privately on a 20-25 minute walk and stopped half way and took some great pictures of us with an amazing view behind.Next we visited the Argan Oil Cooperative. This was very interesting. Adil walked inside with us and introduced us to one of the women who spoke wonderful English. She explained the entire process of how the Argan Oil is made and we were allowed to take pictures freely. After the educational portion we were allowed to browse in the shop and also we were also able to taste the oils and try the lotions and scents. There was absolutely no pressure to buy anything. The women were very friendly.My favorite part of the trip was lunch. We stopped in a small Berber Vilage where a very generous family cooked us a fabulous lunch. My favorite meal during our entire stay in Marrakech! A tomato salad with bread for appetizer, Tagine Chicken and Vegetables and Couscous for main course, Honey Melon and Mint tea for dessert. It was absolutely delicious, not to mention that the view from the terrace of the mountians was completely stunning. We were allowed to look around the home and felt very comfortable there.All along the way, we stopped many other times to take pictures of the beautiful scenery. Adil explained to us all about the culture and the different areas of the mountains. We enjoyed every stop! Another very exciting part of our day was the children. Before we even arrived to Marrakech Adil told us we would have the opportunity to give gifts to the children if we would like. We packed: pencils, paper, lollipops and candy. during our stops in the mountains (even out in the middle of what seemed like nowhere) children would run to see us. It was very heartwarming to give them the little gifts and see the excited expressions on their faces. My only regret is that we hadn't packed more. I loved giving them away :)We were comfortable all day and enjoyed Adil's company very much. I definitely recommend the 4X4 Camel to everyone. This was the perfect experience to get a taste of the Berber Culture and a nice break from the city. Thank you Adil for making our trip to Marrakech a memorable one!"

We visited a Berber market and a place where Argon oil is made. We were then driven through the Atlas Mountains and were treated to some stunning views. We also had a fabulous lunch provided by a lovely Berber family in their own house. All in all it was a wonderful day out and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Marrakech."

            "review": "Wonderful guide and visit to Berber village. I booked this tour after seeing rave reviews on Trip Advisor. The owner, Adil is amazing. From the moment I contacted him via email he was helpful and genuinely interested in our trip to Morocco. We booked for just my husband and myself, but since we were visiting during the end of Ramadan Adil asked if we would combine the tour with another couple. No problem- and it cut the cost by half. This tour is intended to be a unique experience for each person who books. You will visit the Argo cooperative, ride a camel, drink mint tea, visit some popular and beautiful valleys and go into a local Berber village for lunch. We went to the Asni valley as well as the Ourika valley- both beautiful. On the way to the Berber village we drove on an amazing dirt track that took us high above the valley which provided great views of the towns below. The track was something that I cannot see other tours doing, and for me, this was the most unique portion of the trip. Adil asks that you bring something for the children in the village- school supplies, gently used clothing, etc. I stocked up on school supplies before travelling and was so glad I did. The children know the rout Adil takes and they come from miles around to see what his guests have brought them. One thing to note- bring many small items that can be distributed individually- think one colored pencil/one piece of paper/one set of stickers per child. There are so many who come out- I had no idea! We met about 60 children along the way- so be prepared for this with your gifts. They really do need clothing as well, but of course this can be difficult when travelling with weight restrictions. There are many boys who were desperate for soccer balls and items like this- wish I had known in advance as I would have been happy to buy some before leaving. Adil himself is a great tour guide and very knowledgeable. He was happy to chat with us and answer our questions for the entire day about anything we could dream up to ask. It's great having a local guide who can give you information that you would not find elsewhere. He is also very invested in the local community and I was impressed to hear about all he has done for the village- with his help the woman who cooks the local Berber meal has been able to purchase a fridge. Once you see the village you will know how much of a big deal this is. He also knew so many things about the people we saw along the way. He knew what some children were studying in school, who liked to paint pictures, and what medication some children were taken (which he himself purchases from time to time and delivers). What an amazing man. his intentions were wonderful and his interactions and concerns for the locals were commendable. The Argon cooperative is interesting, but we knew in advance that we were not interested in purchasing anything. We spent out time on the terrace enjoying the scenery. The mini-tour is nice, and the women there speak great English and are very informative. You get to taste a bit of the oil and some other items as well as try lotions and such made with the Argon nut. There is no pressure to buy at all. The tour was supposed to include a stop at a local market, which I was really looking forward to, but due to Ramadan, the market was closed. No one's fault. The camel ride is 10 Euros- it is what we expected...geared towards tourists and short. You basically hop on a camel, then get lead in a line for a short walk. I imagines sand dunes and a longer ride, but this wasn't that. You do get really great photos and the guide is more than happy to stop as many times as you need to shoot pictures for you. When you are done you can pet and visit with the camels for a decent amount of time- they had the sweetest baby so we took tons of pictures with him. We stopped for mint tea which was nice as it was along the river in the valley, but the bees were so persistent that we were unable to drink the tea. Instead we ended up with a cupful of drowned bees.....we were unable to get away from them, so we just went on a short walk instead.In the village you will eat with a local family- we really enjoyed this. The terrace you eat on is serene and the view of the village is very pretty. The food she provided was great- best couscous we had on the trip by a long shot. The meal included more food than we could eat between the 4 of us, so come hungry! This visit also cost 10 Euro and in my opinion, it was well worth the cost. For the effort she put into the meal it was a great deal.I was satisfied with the tour, but in my opinion the price is high (150 Euro for the car) and we did visit many places that the major tour companies were going to. We were really looking for a 100% unique, off the beaten path, tour. I imagine that if my husband and I had gone with only the two of us that we might have gotten more of a unique experience. While we did enjoy the day, it felt touristy still and we stopped at the same places as everyone else from the other companies."

            "review": "Excellence X 3!. I planned a holiday in Marrakech with my sister for July and I started looking for things to do while there. I saw this activity by chance on the website, and this was the best chance for my holiday that happened to me. I was impressed by all these great reviews and I knew it can\u2019t be coincidence. So I contacted Adil straight away and booked a trip for the end of July. He was very helpful, he explained to me everything of how the trip will go and what places we will visit and what activities we will do. So on the day, he waited for us in front of the hotel in a 4x4, equipped with water for us and hats to use in case we didn\u2019t bring any ( as the sun in July is very strong in Marrakech ). Basically, he thought of everything. First, we went for the camel rides which was an amazing experience and I recommend it to everybody. It lasted about half an hour during which you can enjoy the stunning views of the Atlas Mountains. After that, we went to the Berber markets where you can get a good sense of what the Berber culture is like, together with the useful explanation of our guide. We also went to see how the women are making argan oil and we got involved in the process, too. It is great to see the whole process from scratch, everything is hand-made and the products are very good quality \u2013 nothing to do with what you\u2019d get from the medina. We bought some nice body lotion but they have a huge variety of argan oil products \u2013 both for cooking/eating and cosmetics. And while you are there, do go on the top of the building and I am sure you will gasp by the scenery that will come in front of you- the staggering Atlas Mountains. Our favourite part of the trip, even before we started it, was visiting a typical Berber family and having lunch at their house. It is so nice to get a glimpse of what the real Morocco is like and we were very much looking forward to it. Hands down, this was the best lunch during our whole holiday; the salad, the chicken tajine, the melon for dessert and not to forget the fabulous Moroccan tea. I am a big fan of the Moroccan tea anyway, so this was the best finish of the lunch there. Did I mention that the view was amazing again? On the way to the family house, we did many stops where we had a chance to give candies and stationary such as pencils and crayons to the local children. They are just lovely; the look on their faces when they see you is just priceless; and so cute when being shy. Do pack yourselves with lots of candies for them beforehand. You will love it. Also, you can get gifts for the family that you will visit for lunch. On the way back, we passed by some markets and Adil was so kind to get fruits for himself and for us, too. He also offered to take us to the Majorel Gardens, but sadly my sister was too tired for more sightseeing for the day. However, this is the best guide I\u2019ve ever had; he was helpful after the trip as well and the day we spent with him was the best day in Morocco. Overall, the trip was amazing; there is no room for regret if you book it. If you like adventures, and want to see the real side of Morocco with all its uniqueness, then this is definitely for you. Excellent trip, excellent guide, excellent experience - Excellence X 3! Thank you for everything, Adil!"

My boyfriend and I spent a FABULOUS day with our guide, starting with collection from our hotel, a short camel ride (on well looked after camels) and then driving for a further hour for a walk in the hills to the waterfalls. The guide took us walking along paths, climbing up rocks, cooling down under waterfalls and experiencing breath taking scenery. There were a number of options that we could have taken depending on fitness levels, and our guide who spoke excellent English checked what we wanted to do regularly while providing us with information about the local area. We walked for a couple of hours in July heat (me 5 months pregnant) and the waterfalls were a welcome break!We visited the ladies producing oil which was very interesting. We did spend some money on products but a total of \u00a350 was a fraction of the cost of buying the same products in London and good to know the money was going to local people. After a further hour drive through more gorgeous scenery we arrived at a small village where a local family prepared the best food I think we ate during our stay in Marrakech. It was delicious and far more than we could eat. Vegetarians catered for. Adil was excellent at arranging everything at quite short notice as we only decided 24 hours prior that we wanted to make the day excursion (9.30-5pm) and had everything arranged that we could have wanted. I would highly recommend 4x4 Camel for anyone visiting Marrakech!"

There were three of us on the tour. It cost 150 euros for all of us, this was without lunch or the camel ride, and was well worth the money it cost. We had a brilliant time, Adil arranged for a driver in a 4 x 4 - air conditioned which was very much needed as the temperature was well into the 40's- to pick us up from our hotel. We had Yahyah who arrived well before 9.30 am and was Brilliant, he spoke very good English and took us firstly to the camels so that myself and my daughter could go on a camel ride, this was for approx 20 mins. After this we made our way to the Atlas Mountains where a guide took us 1850 metres up the mountains, this was absolutely amazing, terrific views. He helped us up parts and explained aspects of the mountain and scenery all the way up. We had a couple of stops on the way for drinks and a rest and there was no time limit to get up the mountain. I would recommend to wear some good trainers or walking boots as it can be a bit slippy at times. We then proceeded to see the Argan Oil factory which was good and no pressure to buy, then we went onto the Berber Home for lunch and the food was amazing, best meal of the week. The views were absolutely terriffic and i would thoroughly recommend this tour to anyone going to Morocco. Thank you so much Adil and Yahyah and also to the guide who took us up the mountains whose name i cannot remember. This was the highlight of our holiday. Many Thanks."

I am travelling by myself and went on a tour to the Atlas Mountains with a mother and daughter from Norway who were kind enough to let me join their day. Adil is such a great guide, so organised, friendly, knowledgeable and patient, with fantastic English. We went to the Berber village market where we bought tagines cheaper than in Marrakesh. We also visited the Argan oil cooperative where the women showed us around and explained the process to us, let us taste Argan oil also. I didn't feel pressured at all to buy anything even though I did as most oil you buy in the souks is heavily diluted so better to get it from the source and support the divorced and abused women of the co-op. The camel ride was interesting as I've never even ridden a horse and we were in 50+ degree heat! Great photos though. The drive up through the mountains was absolutely stunning. The mountains consist of many different colours and it gets much cooler the higher you go (we went up to about 1800m above sea level). We had lunch at the Berber family home. We got a tour of the home and ate lunch on the balcony/patio overlooking the Berber village and mountains. So quiet and peaceful! It was much cooler and the tagine and couscous was the best I have had in Morocco. They gave us so much food we couldn't even finish it all. On the way up to lunch we stopped many times to give Berber children gifts of clothes, pencils, lollies and ice-blocks. Adil has such a great rapport with these children and you can see their faces light up as they run down the road once spotting Adil's 4WD, which by the way is air-conditioned comfort in which I felt totally safe the entire time. I would definitely recommend you take this tour and experience Morocco outside of Marrakesh. I will never forget it! Thank you Adil :)"

We were keen to get out of the city for a day but had reservations about how practical this might be. I contacted Adil from the UK and he was fantastic at advising what might be suitable, altitued limitations etc. On arrival in Marrakech he cam to our hotel to meet us and to assess what might be suitable and in the end we had a fantastic day in the mountains, saw lots, visited a Berber village for lunch and a super argan oil co-operative. We had a super day, probably the most memorable of the holiday, and without Adil's reassurances we wouldn't have gone ahead. Adil was also very informative, chatty and interesting company.I highly recommend 4x4 Camel for tailor made, interesting and fun days out for all ages and mobility levels and send our sincere thanks for all your care and attention."

We found camel tours from trip advisor and e mailed him when we were in Marrakech.He replied quickly and was able to fit a trip in on one of our days there.We wanted to visit Telouet and Ait Benhaddou and so Adil was happy to do a personalised tour.He arrived on time ,his English was excellent, the car was a very comfy Land Cruiser with air con.He even came with bottles of water and bread a nice touch.Adil was a really good guide, very informative but also gave you space.We visted Telouet a magnificent Kasbah with superb views.We had lunch at a good restaurant Adil took us to, he recommended a local dish of beef and fried egg which was nice.We then went to Ait Benhaddou where Amil had arranged a local guide to take us around.Liked the fact he used a local person thus helping local people.This kasbah was amazing so beatiful and well worth visiting.The scenery en route was superb,you got to see the real Morocco in all its beauty and was the highlight of our holiday.The roads were very windy and Adil liked to drive very close to the car in front,those of a nervous disposition may find this scary, despite him being a good driver.All in all an excellent tour and well worth booking with him."

My guide was Yahya, and he was most accomodating, personable, and friendly, even though it was the beginning of Ramadan. The scenery in the Atlas Mounatins were breathtaking, the camel ride was an experience to cherish, the lunch in the Berber home is not to be missed, and the Berber people were endearing. Plus, the weather up high in the mountains was also fantstic despite being int he middle of summer. It was a totally private tour as I was travelling alone. As a single woman there, I felt 101% safe in Yahya's care, and Yahya was also willing to adjust the suggested itinerary to my request. I consider this trip an enrichng experience not to be missed. No complaints whatsoever, except I would skip the Argon oil stop, as I found it pricey and not particularly interesting, and that was my only negative of the day which was well spent. The Berber market was an experience with its hdtle and bustle plus the local way of trades. Bring Dirhan instead of Euros. I would do it again in a heartbeat, and maybe go to the Imlil Village instead.I have heard Imlil is even more beautiful. Next time, I shall :-)"

He was also very accommodating and picked us up at our resort in Lalla Takerkoust! We started off the tour going to a Berber market which was an eye-opening experience and very different from the touristy markets of Marrakech! We then continued on to the beautiful valleys of the Atlas Mountains and stopped at an Argan Oil Women's Cooperative! As we made our way up the hill the views were breathtaking. The Berber village we stopped in for lunch was very remote- be sure to bring little gifts for the village children (lollipops or pencils or clothes). The lunch was delicious and the host family very kind. We had an awesome tour- this is a must-do experience if you are in the Marrakech area of Morocco!!"

He speaks excellent English, handles the winding, mountain roads with aplomb and knows the people and places of the High Atlas Mountains really well.Booking was easy (by email) and Adil was happy to alter the usual tour to suit us (we didn't want to ride camels but did want to visit the waterfalls of the Ourika Valley) and he (and our Berber hostesses) accommodated our differing food requirements with gracious ease (one of us eats meat, the other is vegetarian).The meal in the Berber village was a highlight - the food was delicious, plentiful and beautifully presented and our hostesses charming.The waterfalls were delightfully cool and refreshing after a steep climb with a charming, strong and helpful local guide - take swimsuits if you want to make the most of them. And it was amazing to drive right up into the mountains and see snow in the distance at the top of the highest peak (the 2nd highest in the whole of Africa) - especially in July when Marrakech was so intensely hot.Taking pencils and/or sweets (individually wrapped sweets are best) was a small but great way of connecting with the children along the way. Adil is like the pied piper - all the children know him and flock to the roadside when they see his car. Adil's car was clean, comfortable and more than capable of managing the rough tracks high up in the mountains. He also provided bottled water all day, something we really appreciated.All in all, this was a brilliant way of seeing something of Morocco beyond the very particular nature of Marrakech. Adil helped us understand his country, its traditions and people so much better than we could ever have done alone. And that's what a tour is all about for me..."

            "review": "Fun in the Atlas mountains. We booked this tour based on glowing Trip Advisor reviews, which seldom let us down. While Adil confirmed that he could accommodate our timing request when we booked, he later emailed to say that he could not make it and would have a colleague take us instead. While his colleague was very accommodating, I am not sure that his language skills were quite as good as Adil's, which really limits the ability to learn and enjoy the full range of the experience. That part was disappointing. The tour itself takes you through fantastic country in the High Atlas. It's really beautiful to behold. The guide let us hike for a bit, which was a very welcome break from the car--I would recommend planning on that. A great part of the experience was having lunch at a Berber home. The food was great and the experience of being in a home in a Berber village, rather than going to a restaurant, was one that we and the kids will remember for a long time. Only one other nit to pick: On the way up into the mountains, the guide stopped at a women's collective. While it's interesting to see how people traditionally use local nuts to create a variety of soaps, lotions, etc., and while I hope that there is a legitimate social purpose being served here (i.e., I am hoping that these places truly are collectives, returning all profit to the local community), this falls into the typical enforced-shopping-disguised-as-tour modality that is so common in Morocco. The setting of a women's collective is intended to disarm criticism (and, as above, I hope that the place is legitimate)--but the prices charged there are a multiple of what the same products cost in a market in town. That did not stop us from spending a lot of money there, in hopes that the cause was legitimate, but I did leave feeling that this part of the experience was somewhat coercive--and that it would be refreshing for the guides to at least disclose more about this stop before it happens."

Our guide, Yahyah, arrived at our hotel at the appointed time, 7:30 a.m. We went directly to the Berber Market in one of villages located near the base of the mountain range. We wandered through the market and witnessed Berber commerce and customs take place before our eyes. The Market is an experience not to be missed. From the Market, we went on and stopped for a short camel ride. After the camel ride, Yahyah drove us to the Argan oil cooperative, where of course, we spent about $300 on their fine products. A word of warning here: this stuff is not cheap, even at the coop. From the Argan oil coop, we drove into the High Atlas Mountains where we were met by Berber children who rushed to our car in hopes of receiving sweets and candies. Ofcourse, per 4x4's recommendation, we had candy ready for them.  Later, we had lunch in a home of a Berber family while overlooking a Berber village nestled against the mountain range. What an incredible experience..... My only near-complaint is that our guide's accent made it a little difficult to understand what he was saying. In sum, though, a fantastic experience with a well-organized tour guide operator. Highly recommended."

After much research me and my firends decided to book adil for our trip to see the atlas mountains as his tour seemed so highly rated by travelers and we were not diss-pointed . Booking was very easy , i just emailed adil and before i knew it everything was finalized. Adil was a pleasure to book with as the whole booking went so smooth :) We were piked up at our hotel in a very comfortable air conditioned 4x4, our guide for the day was YahYha. Yahyha was an amazing guide, he was so knowledgeable and seem to have a real passion for the tour and also a real pleasure to be around, easy to talk to , we wern't short of a few laughs along the way, he was allot of fun to be around. He was very accommodating allowed us to stop whenever we wanted along the route which allowed us to discover a very old mosque that we had a look inside words cannot describe the beauty. Yaha stopped at the best view points without us prompting him and allowed us to take in the spectacular view and sum snaps of course. On route up the first mountain we stopped to ride some Camels, this was an awsome experience. short but sweet and allot of fun :) We also stopped to visit the argan oil factory were we really got a chance to see the hard work that was put in to deriving the oil, the tour guide in the factory was very good, she explained everything very well and answered any question we had. We also got to grab ourselves a few bargains.The tour was full of beautiful spectacular views , i can not describe the beauty of the atlas mountains you have to see it to believe it. Yhayha allowed us to stop to buy some sweet and footballs for the berber children, but we couldn't resist having a bit of a kick about at the peak of the mountains ourselves lol, giving sweets and footballs to the berber children was a very fulfilling experience, my advice is buy lots of sweets because we seemed to run out :(The highlight of tour was definitely food at the Berber household. We eat on an outside terrace overlooking the spectacular views an experience unlike any other. The food was amazing by far one of the best meals of our trip. The family were very accommodating and allowed us to make our prayers in the living area. yhayha then made us some berber tea, which i videoed him explaining the relevance of the tea and demonstrating how to make it properly.... i must say was on a jammie oliver, rick stein level lol On our descent from the mountains we stopped at a Berber market, a chance to see how they live, and i got a chance to buy sum authentic berber tea :) overall the tour was amazing .... i would say the best tour of our trip to Marrakesh by far . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED..!!!!! Thnx yahyah and adil for the experience.. SHUKRAN .. :)"

Adil replied within half an hour of us emailing, and described the trip well, detailing what the day trip would consist of. We're extremely happy to have chosen this trip, rather than those you can book through the holiday reps.We were picked up by Yahya at 9am on the dot, who drove us out of Marrakech and stopped off at a market in a small town. This was a real eye opener, and showed us a traditional market, which is a contrast to those you see in the medina in Marrakech. Next we travelled up into the High Atlas Mountains. Yahya was extremely knowledgable, and told us everything we needed to know, ranging from information on Berber culture, music, geography and much more. We stopped on the way, taking pictures and having a small walk up the mountain itself. The Argan Oil co-operative was excellent - we had a tour from a very knowledgable guide, who showed us the way the different types of Argan Oil products were produced, as well as allowing us to try samples (both cosmetic and edible!).We then travelled over to the 2nd mountain. One thing I would suggest to bring on the trip is a bag of sweets and/or pens and pencils for the children in the villages - Adil mentioned this in his email to us, and it's a nice touch.The camel ride was great! We were taken on a twenty minute ride on 'Aisha' and 'Shakira', whilst having the opportunity for pictures to be taken, a great experience and one that provides many photos for when you get home. The meal with the Beber family topped the trip off. We sat on an open terrace in the middle of an absolutely stunning landscape, eating the freshest food you could imagine. Having mentioned that me and my partner are vegetarians, Adil and Yahya organised a vegetable tagine to be prepared by the family, which tasted better than anything we tried in the Jemaa El Fna. By the end of the meal, we were very well fed, the meal included a delicious starter and the main course (tagine) was followed by fresh watermelon and mint tea. After this, we had a relaxing drive back into Marrakech, with a small sleep on the way.We can only thank Yahya and Adil for being such gracious hosts and for providing us with the highlight of our holiday. I can highly recommend this trip to anybody that is travelling to Marrakech. This trip will take you away from the hectic centre of Marrakech, and show you a completely different side to an already beautiful country."

I must say that it was the right decision not to book through Thomson, as it was not only cheaper, though Adil and his colleague(profuse apologies as I cannot remeber his name) were both fantastic guides. The information was excellent, the pace of the trip just perfect. We had a number of stops along the trip, and it became apparent that Adil really has a strong interest in trying to support real local people benefit from the advantages of tourism. We stopped at a womans co-operative where they produce a wide range of argan oil goods - The range was fantastic and in fact I've tried these at home and they are just delicious! This is done in a way which is sympathetic to the local people and I never feel pressured into buying anything. We also stopped at a Berber market which was an expereince in itself. The sights, sound and smells are incredicle, though the meat section was quite a sight! You do have to ex[ereince all of this to get a real feel for how the Berber people live. The lunch with the Berber family was just the icing on the cake...The food was out of this world, the service great, laid back and extremely friendly. My 16 year old son and 17 year old daughter thought it was a fantastic day, so take from that what a superb trip this was. We actually went on the trip with a family we met from the hotel, Terry, Helen, Lexi and Ellie....this just made the trip even better. It was lovely to share such a unique experience with another family. I could not recommend this trip highly enough. The guides were great, the views were simply breathtaking. In summary a fantastic day for all sorts of groups and suggest that you consider using Adil and 4X4 camel as this is not only business for him, though it is also clearly contributing to the real indigenous people of Morroco...a must for anyone going to Marrakesh. Please do not listen to any negative reviews, as this trip was just fantastic!!!"

Things started out well, our driver, a colleague of Adil arrived in good time to pick us up from our hotel. We were given a brief itinerary of what was in store for us and our first stop was a small town about half an hour outside Marrakech.The market turned out a little more than a car boot sale. Our tour guide simply walked us through the market, including some areas where cruelty to animals was very much evident. Once he did his shopping we turned around and went back to the car. The next stop was nearer to the Atlas mountains where we went on a camel ride (not included in the tour). This was fun, but not as some as the pictures on here suggest. Not much else to say about this really, it was a camel ride for 20 minutes and we took a few photos.We then headed towards a place where they produced argan oil. There was a brief talk about what argan oil is and how it's made. After this we were shooed into their store and had one of their sellers follow us around. We felt very pressured to buy something and it wasn't cheap either. So we headed back to the car.The next couple of hours we drove upwards into the Atlas mountains, and our driver gave us a chance to take some pictures. Our driver also had some cold water, which was nice. He explained to us about the colours of the rocks and the layouts of some of the villages.Our final stop was at the L'oliveraie de marigha. They had a swimming pool with a beautiful view which we could have used. Sadly neither Adil nor our driver explained to us in our email correspondence or before the tour began, to bring our swimming costumes, which was a shame. We both ordered steak and fries but could not enjoy this for two reasons. First the steak was full of gristle and tough even though we ordered it medium rare and secondly, flies were landing on our food and buzzing around our heads. In the end neither of us ate the steaks or fries and left it to the flies. We had sorbet for desert which, as sorbet tends to be, nice and refreshing, but let's face it, it's hard to get it wrong. I think Gordon Ramsay needs to pay this place a visit on his kitchen nightmares programme. There's no point to al fresco dining if you're not going to do anything about the fliesThe tour ended with a fairly quiet two hour drive back to Marrakech. I suggest to anyone looking to do a tour of the Atlas mountains (if you're not afraid of heights) to hire a car and do it yourself."

It sounded very good and very good value too compared to other companies or booking through your travel agent. We decided to book it, because of the good reviews.We didn't really know what to expect. They told us roughly what we were gonna do and what places we were going to visit. Yahya picked us up from our hotel and we drove towards the Atlas Mountains. The first stop was a market. It was great to see where the local people get their shopping from. Everything so fresh and so different than any market in Europe. I never seen anything like it and it was a very good start of the trip. On our way to the Atlas Mountains, Yahya told us a lot about the villages and history of the area. It was all very interesting. We stopped at a place to ride camels, which was so much fun and not scary at all! Totally worth the 100 DH!On our way we also met Adil who was guiding a family and doing the same route as us. We then drove to the Argan Oil place which was also very interesting. The products seemed quite overpriced, but remember you also support the women working all day long. We bought this kind of 'peanutbutter' which taste very very good and so pure! We were also welcome to take pictures and use the toilets for free.After that we drove through the valley near the 'river', which was hardly a river because of the heath, but still very beautiful. We drove higher up into the mountains and Yahya stopped once in a while so we could take pictures and walk for a bit if we wanted to. Which was very nice and we loved it! He made sure he did whatever we wanted to do and he had so much knowledge about the nature, villages and people.At last we arrived at the Berber village. Never seen anything like it in real life. But it didn't seem very poor. The people had their farm and food and everything was very clean! The people are very welcoming. They showed us their house and their kitchen. Adil and his group were there too and we all had lunch together. We sat on a terrace on the building with an amazing view over the mountains. Then they served our food. And honestly, it was the best food we've ever eaten in our lives! So much taste to it and so fresh. Me and my boyfriend are vegetarians so we got a vegetable tagine. There was so much food and it was all perfectly prepared. We got mint tea and watermelon afterwards. Which tasted a hundred times better than a watermelon in England.We stayed for a bit and had a very nice chat with Adil and Yahya. They are very nice and their English is amazing.We definitely want to do this again! It really made our holiday and that is thanks to Adil an Yahya and of course the Berber family that made our amazing lunch. Don't forget to bring something for the kids. Like stationary or sweets. The kids are very thankful and it makes them so happy.I recommend this to anyone who wants to see more of the country and doesn't want to go with an overpriced travel agency trip. This was the best thing we did on our holiday. The good thing was that we didn't know exactly what to expect. It was all a surprise which made it extra fun.Thanks again Yahya and Adil. We definitely come back!"

I was also apprehensive after a rip-off experience by a Medina guide the Sofitel concierge recommended. Well I'm glad I chanced it. Adil was my guide and from start to finish I had a great, safe time. He was such an easy conversationalist I felt more like I was hanging out with an old school friend. He was also a decent driver, which was important to me given that I can be prone to motion sickness.We covered the same stops mentioned in earlier reviews - maybe not exactly in the order he first listed in his email to me, but the activities were pretty much all there. These included the camel ride, the visit to the Berber village market, the Argan oil cooperative, and lunch at a Berber house.What I really liked about it was that it felt a little more authentic, especially when I found myself sitting down to lunch in a house built from clay and mud - incidentally the best meal I had in Marrakech. I'd had two tagine dishes earlier in the week, and it beat the posh restaurants in town hands down - succulent, tender chicken steaming in a rich, delicious gravy. I'm hungry now just thinking about it. Adil was very concerned I ate it properly too - showing me how to dip the bread in the stew. I'd also recommend the camel ride - I did mine at the start, and Adil had come properly equipped with chilled water and a hat, so I was well taken care of. The flowers the camel handler picked for me along the way were a nice touch.You won't be getting waterfalls on this tour, but then again you're not likely to be missing much...This was easily the highlight of my week in Marrakech."

We have just returned from a day trip to the Atlas Mountains visiting and lunching with a Berber family and the experience was absolutely amazing. As everybody else on this page, I cannot recommend this trip highly enough and definitely anybody visiting Marrakech should first contact Adil to see what part of your visit he can organise for you. He is a true professional, very prompt in his responses and a man really trying to contribute to his community, whilst being a wonderful entrepeneur. Tremendously good value and a totally authentic day. The lunch with the Berber family - the wonderful Habibba and her gorgeous daughters was a real highlight and the tanjine was mouth-wateringly good - cooked in a scruplously clean kitchen and accompanied by tomato salad and couscous...DELICIOUS and at a true honest price. Even though Adil had suggested to bring some sweets, paints, colouring books, or clothes for the kids in his e-mail response, I totally forgot (in fact didn't read the e-mail from Adil properly) - but we could stop to buy some small things in a shop - if you can remember do buy / bring things for the kids - they are so gorgeous and really get delighted with these small gifts and Amil has a wonderful rapport with them Truly lunch with the Berber Family is an experience not to be missed and it appears that Adil makes no extra commission from this which is admirable. Adil was extremely polite, very patient in answering all our questions and made wonderful suggestions for dinners and hotels for future visits. The transport (4x4 land rover) was extremely comfortable and when we asked where we could buy some wine, Adil took us to buy some wonderful Moroccan wine on the way back to the hotel. For me, this has been the highlight of my trip to Marrakech - it is a really wonderful place but next time I come back I will certainly leave some extra days for a trip to tha Sahara, Essouaire and without any doubt I will be making my arrangements with Adil....."

As expected after reading other comments, my girlfriend and I spent a very good day in the Ourika valley and Asni valley!Adil was not available the day we had the trip so his colleague Yahya who guided us in the valleys.He is a very nice person who knows a lot about the Atlas and the Berber culture.We were hosted by a berber familly for lunch with very good home made tajine and couscous.We really recommend the trip with 4x4 Camel and we advise you if you are a couple to find another couple to go with you as it will decrease the costs for you. Even with a 2 persons trip, the costs will be cheaper than going there through excursion agencies or hotel partners.To book it is easy, simply send an email to Adil. When I did it he answered in less than 2 days!Thank you Adil and Yahya, we will come back to you when we next stay in Marrakech."

Our guide was very knowledgable but was also quiet so you can take in all the beautiful scenery, we would stop for photos whenever we wanted and toilet breaks! The market was brilliant! We went to the meat market too, and as vegetarians we shouldn't have although he did say to us i know you both are vegetarian , do you want to see it for some reason my husband said yes! Lots of great information whilst walking round here from our guide too. We done the camel ride which I was abit worried about due to going on one years who in Egypt but I'm so glad we did it it was brilliant! The man walking us round stopped a lot to take photos for us and was a very happy man! After the camels, we went for lunch at a family home in the mounts s. it was incredible the food was delicious (vegetable tagine) bread, tomato salsa and melon for after all washed down with moroccan tea which our guide showed us how to do it the moroccan way. We went to give the berber children some pens and sweets but they wasn't there so we stopped further down the mountain and giving these children something so little was incredible, I could go on and one about this tour but see for yourself, it was brilliant we can't fault it in anyway. We done it on our first day which was good I think so you know how people live all from the comfort of a 4x4 by a guide who knows a lot! Enjoy"

The arrangements were easy to make via the Internet. Adil was prompt in his response to all inquiries. A couple of days before our trip, he contacted us to see if we would mind if another couple joined us. I found the inquiry not only thoughtful, but very professional. My daughter and I were fine with the addition -- a young couple from London -- who were charming and interesting. The day passed quickly and the itinerary included experiences one would never have without a knowledgable and well established guide like Adil. He patiently answered our many questions and gave us insight into the Berber way of life.He had suggested we bring sweets for the many children up in the village and we did. It was one of the many highlights. The children were obviously familiar with Adil and they rushed out to greet us as we traveled along the road to our lunch destination. The interaction between Adil and the children was wonderful to watch. Our family lunch was delicious. It was presented to us as we sat overlooking the beautiful view from an outdoor terrace. We felt like we had a true glimpse into the culture of the Berber people and would highly recommend taking this day trip."

I emailed Adil just a week before our travel dates and he replied my emails very promptly and was able to accommodate us into his very busy schedule. He was very polite, and gave us the best deal for the tour. He usually does private tours, but we agreed to go on a shared tour with a lovely French couple. Our tour guide was Aziz, who spoke fluent English and was very fun to be with on the tour. He has a good sense of humour and was very knowledgeable about culture, the people and the traditions in Marrakech. We stopped at the Argan oil cooperative to learn of how the women made pure argan oil by hand, it was all very impressive. We had a chance to ride on camels, which was personally the highlight of my trip. Aziz was very reliable as he took care of our belongings while the four of us rode on camels, a 30-minute journey around the mountains and across the bridge and streams of water. Our camel tour guide was very friendly and he made numerous stops and took pictures of all of us. Indeed, an unforgettable experience. Along the way, Aziz stopped for children who were waiting by the side of the road as we donated some colour pencils, crayons and clothes for them. We then stopped at a local Berber house where we were warmly welcomed and they cooked a very tasty lunch for all of us. We ate traditional Morrocan food on the terrace overlooking the mountains. Aziz, who was very talented in making Mint tea showed us a step-by-step procedure which we all enjoyed watching and drinking. Along the way, Aziz stopped at many sceneries which were worth to be photographed and allowed us to take pictures while he patiently waited. The most memorable was the 'Brad Pitt village', the Fertility centre and the many contrasting colours of the mountains, which to find out more about it, you should definitely join the tour as we did. Our last stop before heading back was the village of Asni which was the administrative village and we watched the locals from the car as they go through their daily routine. Overall, the tour was not only enjoyable, but very memorable, and I would highly recommend the tour to anyone and everyone of every age, no second thoughts! It is definitely a must-do in the beautiful town of Marrakech. Many thanks to both Adil and Aziz and we wish you all the best and hope to go back on another tour with you in the near future."

We toured with his colleague, Yahya (spelling?), who was extremely knowledgable, friendly, and a great guide. The highlights were seeing the behind the scenes Berber culture and some of our conversations with Yahya. We bought some pencils and sweets for the children -- which was one of he most rewarding experiences when we saw them smile. I only wish we had been ale to plan ahead to bring them some soccer balls or other toys.

We had seen on trip advisor that 4X4 Camel was highly rated and they ran private tours which is exactly what we were looking for. We booked a tour of the Atlas mountains. Adil was very quick to respond to all email enquiries with a friendly and professional manner. Our tour started with a stop at a Berbere market, which was an amazing experience and one we were both pleased to have been apart of. The vast array of products on sale was brilliant. We then opted to have a camel ride on our way up into the mountains which was an excellent experience (even with the cheeky thing trying to bite your bottom). The highlight of the trip was stopping off at a village and eating the most wonderful lunch in a Berbere home. Incredible setting, with amazing views. The food was the best we experienced during our whole stay in Morocco. We had read the reviews suggesting taking sweets and pens/paper/books etc, which we did, however I wish I had taken more. The children were lovely and very friendly. Im sure they had a good giggle as I tried hard to say a few words to them in Arabic (VERY badly). Adil was the perfect tour guide, well respected by the locals, knowledgeable, and extremely friendly. We felt comfortable and well looked after throughout, which included myself getting nippy and Adil kindly finding me a jacket to wear. We had such an amazing day and one we will not be forgetting. We would highly recommend to anybody heading to Marrakesh to book themselves a tour with Adil. We will be contacting him again to book another tour next time we head to Morocco. Thank you so much!"

Then we visited the Argan Oil Co-operative which was very interesting and the women friendly. You can also buy oil there if you wish. (The toilet there is also modern!) The lunch at the Berber house was our favourite though \u2013 so authentic and an amazing view! The family were friendly and smiley! The kids you meet along the roads also were so grateful of pens, paper & sweets! We really recommend you take these \u2013 they have the most gorgeous appreciative little faces!

As has already been said in the many reviews Adil the owner/guide was brilliant from the moment I contacted him. The day was excellent and we saw all the things already mentioned, Berber market, argan oil being produced, breathtaking views etc. Adil was kind enough to stop when we said we wanted a traditional tagine, he took us to a pottery workshop and even did the bartering for us !!The argan production was very informative and the ladies working there were very sweet. The Berber market was interesting with Adil talking us through a number of sections... But don't head to the meat area if vegetarian !!We stopped for a camel ride and Adil helped choose two calmer camels as some looked like, and were behaving like teenagers !We then continued 'off road' high into the Atlas Mountains seeing a number of local berber children who were so happy to receive a few sweets, they obviously know Adil as he spoke to many of them even stopping at one point to apply a plaster to a small boy who had cut his finger.We then stopped for lunch at a Berber families home, which was lovely both the views and the food. After lunch we came back through another valley.All in all this was a good trip I would recommend it. I feel a little more information about Marrakech and the Berber traditions would have been helpful but ultimately that's not what this trip was about....it was about seeing into the lives of Berber people and seeing what happens outside the new town and the souks. This was really what Marrakech is, nice people, living simple happy lives. If only our own children could see what makes these children smile ....Adil is a really nice friendly relaxed guy and whether travelling as a family or even lone females, I couldn't recommend him enough"

Adil is one of those people. He provided an experience for us that was completely customized to our needs and wants for the day - this was no \"cookie-cutter\" tour at all. Right from the beginning, Adil was prompt in replying to my many emails and queries, and was extremely flexible and professional.More than anything, he is trustworthy - a trait extremely precious and rare in my experiences dealing with tour guides. The word I would use to describe our day with Adil would be best described saying \"authentic\". Adil is obviously respected by everyone who knows him - both in the city and in the mountains. His commitment and his vision for making the lives of those living in Marrakech, those women working in cooperatives, and the children he has gotten to know so well is truly inspiring. Adil was on time (even early - my husband loved this!) and always responded to all emails and questions promptly and effeciently. We were able to add two more people to the tour at the last minute (we met them randomly on our trip and we were so happy they were able to join us, as I'm sure they enjoyed the day as much as we did!)We learned about the culture, the troubles, the beauty, the rituals, the daily lives of those living there. It was beautiful, and it was honest. Adil is truly an incredible person - and he very clearly has found his calling.I read from the other reviewers to bring toys, books, etc. for the kids on the tour, and I cannot stress enough how very valuable these things are to these children. I'm so happy we brought things along, and I would strongly recommend anyone planning a tour with 4x4 camel do the same. Some of the things that would be most valuable would be notebooks, pencils, pens, crayons, pencil crayons, balls, sturdy water bottles (like Nalgene or Thermos) (they have little access to fresh water, so a water bottle to carry their water would be beneficial), any protective clothing to help shield from the elements (windbreakers, etc.), books to help with reading/letters/alphabet/math.As someone who loves to travel, I am always looking forward to my next journey and another new country to explore. After leaving Marrakech, the next trip I want to do is to return back to Marrakech, find Adil again, and do more tours! He does overnights in the desert, lots of different valley/waterfall exploration, cooperative tours, and knows many of the best places to eat, find beautiful kaftans, find ceramics, carpets, and even spices. I would have spent my entire week in Marrakech with Adil if I could have! This experience will be remembered forever. Thank you Adil."

Yaya was telling us about what life was like in Marrakech and he spoke very good English. We visted the Argan oil factory and how the old woman made the oil. As we climbed higher we stopped and all of sudden all these children came to see us and we gave them pens,pencils,books they were over the moon with them and the joy on their faces was lovely to see. We stopped for a four course lunch in a Berber house and the family couldnt do enough for us.The food was lovely. After lunch we headed back on the road and came down the other side of the mountain.

We visited a Berber market - it was interesting to see a genuine market for the Berber people ( not the same as the Souks in Marrakech) and Adil explained interesting facts along the way. He was very flexible and easy going and stopped on route at a carpet shop as we requested. We had also arranged with Adil to stop at an Argan Oil Cooperative where the ladies were very friendly. Adil arranged for us to have a wonderful home cooked tagine and couscous in a Berber village ( made by a local lady and served in her home), We went off road to head out to the villages. It was a delight to see the village children run out when they heard Adil's car coming and it was a pleasure to see the children so grateful to receive the sweets, pencils and pens that we had bought along. The scenery was stunning, the driving safe, Adil is well suited to his job - he is friendly, informative and confident. I would book another tour with Adil in a flash- A good way to see the authentic Berber villages- without being ripped off. I Highly recommend Adil and his 4x4 camel tours!"

We met the locals and even had the opportunity to visit and had lunch with a Berber family at a minimum cost. It was heartwarming to learn that this lady cook collects $$ by feeding travelers and sent it to her son for higher education in the city. We also brought candies and some color pencils to distribute to kids along the way on the mountain street. Remember to take some sugar free candies as you do come across kids with Juvenile diabetes.

It was a real experience for our privileged Western children to see how pleased the local children were with simple gifts. The local children seemed a little offhand at first, but Adil explained they were just a little shy, and the moment we waved or smiled at them, they beamed back.The lunchtime meal was excellent, with quite stunning views from the terrace.Overall, excellent trip, Good value compared to the Thomson ones, and the highlight of our trip."

We are absolutely thrilled that we took this tour. We started at about 09:00 A.M. and our first stop was the weekly local Berber Market (every Sunday). It's similar to a farmer's market but truly authentic Berber souk. We bought some dates from the market and found them to be very cheap compared to the souks in Djemma el Fna. Even the orange juice at the Berber Market was fresh and not sweetened (unlike what you may find at the souks). We did the usual - Ourika Valley, Asni Valley, Argan Cooperatif and other sights. My husband and I enjoy photography and Adil was kind to make some unscheduled stops so we could capture the beautiful landscape and macro photos of local flora. The best part of the trip was undoubtedly the visit to the Berber village. It is really heartwarming to meet the lovely children. Very down to heart, wide smiles and very honest. We had taken pencils, crayons, erasers, stickers (kids loved these!) and a few other items. If the kids had already received a gift from us and say, we lost track of who all we had given the gift and offered another one, they wouldnt accept it and show us the item (gift) they had already been given. I wish I had known the ages of the children in the village. It would have been so useful when we were purchasing items to carry with us. We must have met roughly about 60 children and they were between the ages of 2-10; so stationary items are good but I imagine balls and other simple toys would also be appreciated. My husband really appreciated what Adil was doing for his society. He is not only promoting Moroccan culture and providing value to the tourists but also helping in the upliftment/development of the village folks. And it's not like, its only the tourists who bring gifts. During our trip, we found Adil also bringing items for the locals to use. The Berber family we visited were really humble and I had the best chicken tagine and couscous there. My husband's a vegetarian but there was no problem as Adil had ensured Veg tagine was also prepared. The locals adore Adil and one 8-yr old boy gifted Adil clay items which he had made on his own. Adil was extremely kind to let us have 2 items as memoirs. Adil is a great guide too - we discussed several topics and learnt a lot about Morocco's history, culture, religion orientation, etc that is hard to find in travel books. Overall, a wonderful time and unforgettable day. Thanks Adil for your hospitality."

            "review": "A Moroccan day trip with a personal touch. Highly recommend the day tour with Adil as its an unique and authentic Moroccan experience. We were very lucky as Adil managed to squeeze us in on a day his wife and son were also visiting so we got to spend the day with them too. It started with a brief camel tour up and down a hill which was just enough to experience but without a sore bum! We visited the Argan oil cooperative and it was interesting to watch the women cracking the nuts to make the oil. There's plenty to buy in the shop but bring cash as its not cheap but the hand cream is lovely. My favourite part was spending time in the Berbere village and with all of the children. They were all very polite and Adil is very popular as he obviously does a lot for the village. We're grateful he told us to bring gifts for the children (we took along coloured pencils and stickers) as it was a pleasure giving them. Adil bought footballs so if you can't bring anything with you ask him to take you to the shop to buy them. If you can bring gifts from home bring children's clothes and shoes. We had lunch with a local family and the chicken tagine was the best we had during our trip. Plenty of scenic photo opportunities in the hills during the day and good value for money. Our top tip: Make sure you book it before you go as he only does 1:1 tours so they get booked up fast."

After reading all of his glowing reviews prior to arriving in Marrakech, we told Adil that he had a very good reputation to uphold and he did not disappoint! The day we spent with Adil was truly one of the best experiences we had during our trip to Marrakech. It was obvious during our time with Adil how much he is loved and respected by the communities in which he serves \u2013 and for good reason. From the moment he picked us up at our hotel he was a true gentleman and an extremely knowledgeable guide. His tour of traditional Berber village life is a fascinating compliment to hustle and bustle of Marrakech and an experience we will never forget. If you are fortunate enough to take a trip with Adil, don't forget to bring along a few sweets, school supplies, clothes, etc., to distribute to the many local children you will surely see during your tour \u2013 you will never forget the grateful expressions on their faces. Thank you and keep up the good work you're doing Adil, we can't wait to come back to beautiful Morocco!"

Interestingly, another group from our riad were setting out on a similar day trip when we climbed into Adil's spacious 4X4 in the morning. Off we went towards the hills when suddenly our friends took a different route ...\"where are they going?\" I asked Adil, our wonderful guide and driver, \"to collect others\" he replied. That is one of the best things about this company - it's just you - your party - and what YOU want to do. No following the well worn tourist trail for us. Off we bumped, off road and left the trail of tourist mini buses far behind. Adil knows the locals, takes clothes and sweets for the children and has helped a local family to build a kitchen and bathroom as others have stated. We ate one of the best meals we had in Marrakech in the Berbere village with our guide, saw everything we could have desired to and never felt pressured to buy anything. If you are going to Marrakech you won't do any better than Adil and his 4x4. When we met up with the others from our riad in the evening, sure enough they had joined up with a group of Canadian tourists and travelled round in a big group. Not for us! So glad we read about 4x4 Camel on Trip Advisor first and so will you be. Book ahead to avoid disappointment. Thanks so much for a great day, Adil."

            "review": "Make a wish, Adil will make your dream trip come true... I have to say, I might be one of Adil's most difficult to satisfy clients. Morroco is a country quite far to travel from where I am originally. Given the opportunity to travel to Marrakech, I was determined to arrange the best possible arrangement to see the majestic Atlas mountain with family. Even before we met, I was exchanging emails with Adil in great detail. He responded to every questions I had promptly, no matter how petty the questions were. We wanted the trip to be as authentic as it can be, Adil made it possible for us. Our trip was a little bit different from Adil's usual itinerary because we actually combined it with the cooking lesson with Habiba ( I have separate review for her session, Berber cuisine) Due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to cancel my first booking with him. He was a gentleman. He did not request for any compensation for his loss. Fortunately, my family & I had the opportunity to travel to Marrakech afterwards. Reminded by his professionalism when we had to cancel previously, we decided to reserve for his trip. I am glad that we made that decision. The trip to Atlas Mountain with Adil was definitely an experience of a lifetime. To begin with, Adil is a punctual person. We agreed to start the journey at 8.30am, he arrived 10minutes earlier. He also spoke good English. He also tried hard to satisfy his client. My husband was asking him for advice on where to buy good leather jackets, instead of telling us, he brought us to the shop at the end of the trip. At the end of our journey, we accidentally left the clay turtle which my 3yrs son adores (gift from Habiba), Adil kindly returned the ' turtle' to us the next day. Some of the places in the mountains he included in his trips are not reachable by bus. You will definitely need a 4x4 & an experienced driver. The trip we had was definitely authentic. I echoed the comments of previous reviewers on the Berber market. Definitely an eye opener. Very colourful and much in contrast with other markets we have been, including the Souks of Medina. Colourful painted lorries used as 'buses', donkey carts trespassing small lanes in between stalls, traditional doctors & barbers, fruits & vegetables, basically a one stop centre for everything you need for living in the Atlas mountain.We bought our spices here and glad we did. Not only that the price is cheaper but also the quality of the spices. My daughter & I really enjoyed our cooking lessons with Habiba (I have also written a separate review for habiba's lesson : Berber cuisine) . The lesson itself was as authentic as it can be. Not the usual cooking school :) Our cooking lesson with Habit was arranged by our guide Adil (4x4 camel). The lessons are private (only me & my daughter) Unlike the usual cooking class, we learn to cook in a real Berber kitchen. No formalities, unpretentious, more fun & personal touch. Habiba did not speak English. But that was not a barrier for us. Her gestures are comprehensible plus Adil was with us acting as a translator and also helping my daughter cook. My daughter was inspired by the Junior Masterchef so she requested if she can make her own tangine instead of just helping me. Habiba & Adil arranged for my daughter to have a small table for her to cook her own small chicken tangine. Suffice to say we had more than what we bargained for. Great views, excellent food (best Tangine & Zaalok so far) and we experience the generosity of the Berber people who had so little but give so much. I do not speak the same language as Habiba & vice versa but I can feel Habiba's warmth and kindness towards her guests. I am humbled by her, there was an incident worth mentioning, As I saw Habiba's basic kitchen, lacking of modern utensils but full of labour & love, I was wondering if I can give her something. How I wished I have brought some token for her from home. So, I thought to myself and then discussed with my husband, what if we offer to buy from her the tangine set that we used in the cooking lesson at a good price. In our mind we were thinking, with that, we can have the memories and she can have a new one. I have also checked beforehand that she did have many tangine sets in her kitchen so it is not a trouble for her if we buy one of them.Little did I know that she refused my money and gave me the tangine set as a gift. Humbled, I tried to find a valuable thing to give from my purse apart from money, I did not have any. So I gave her my brooch which I am embarrassed to confess that was of little value. It is more for her to keep as memories. As we were leaving her house, again I was humbled by her gift to my son, a clay turtle which my son fondly played whilst we were cooking. Camel rides afterwards was enjoyable. Adil really knows how to 'select' which camel man for his client. I had the experience of riding a camel before. But this was much more fun for the whole family this time mostly because of the camel man. We went camel riding with the background of Atlas mountain. It was raining slightly but that did not dampen our mood. My children were sleepy but I woke them up anyway because they were looking forward to the ride. The camel man was very kind. Helped with my daughter's shoes which was untied. Singing along whilst we were riding the camel. Actually, he was only chanting: very good.. Very good.. Marhaba.. Marhaba.. Engaging my kids to participate in his chant. My kids really enjoyed the ride that they wanted more at the end of it :) And the camel man took nice pictures as well. The scenery of the Asni & Ourika valley on the journey was amazing, the mud-houses blending with the mountains, small rivers, cactuses, blooming flowers..We regret that it was raining that we couldn't take as many scenery pictures of the mountains as we like. We told Adil about it via email once we were back home.I am surprised to receive his call from Marrakech the same day that I wrote the email. He made a promise to snap us some scenery pictures the next time he goes there and email us the pictures. Adil, we are looking forward for that & really appreciate the gesture.For us, it really shows that Adil really try to give his best for his client. We hope Adil will be pleased to know that each family member had a great time. An experience of a lifetime and of course, VERY authentic indeed..Thank you Adil! ~ a detail review dedicated to Adil from your 'detail' client ;)"

If you are reading this review, you are more thank likely researching the many tour guides to take you on a trip to the Atlas Mountains in Marrakech. However, if you want to give something back, and pay something forward to the Moroccan and Berber people - Adil at 4x4 Camels is the right choice for you!Adil was extremely prompt and helpful during our various email exchanges in arranging our trip, which would inlcude a visit to a local Berber Market, the Argan Oil Co-Operative and lunch with a local Berber Family. He also gently suggested we may like to bring some treats with us to give to the local Berber children.So armed with pens, pencils, crayons and sweeties and felt trip pens, Adil met us at our Riad in the morning and we set off for a magical day. First we stopped off at the Berber Market where we spied two footballs - given we had seen so many children playing with something that hardly resembed a ball during our 8-day visit in Morocco- we bought the two footballs to add to our cache of treats!As we drove up the Mountains, the local children spotted Adil's (very comfortable) 4x4 and we stopped to share some of the small gifts we had bought for them. Having lived in Southern Africa for many years, I am always consious of the fine line between being patronising - and offering kindness, so it ws heart-warming to see the local children receive our small treats with gentle, shy smiles. Adil also took us to a local school where we met and spoke with the local teachers and were able to give them some more crayons and pencils. The relationship Adil has with the teachers is of such respect - and his efforts and drive to help and them can only be admired.Lunch with the wife of the local Iman was something I will treasure for a long time - beautiful food, and stunning scenery. Over time, Adil explained by bringing guests to her home, who pay a nominal fee for lunch, she has managed to put windows in her house, upgrade her kitchen and make other home improvements. The visit to the Argan Oil Co-Operative was also extremely interesting and a great example of what eco-toruism can deliver..So, if you want a grand day out - you could choose any of the many tour guides you may find on TripAdvisor. However, if you want to give something back, and pay it forward and help Adil in his amazing efforts to bring about positive change and happiness to the local Berber people and their children - 4x4 Camels is definitely your only choice.Best wishes to you Adil - may you grow from strength to strength and may light and goodness always shine on you and the local Berber people and their families."

He responded promptly to my email and suggested a suitable itinerary for my husband and I. Adil collected us on time from our hotel and we set off for the Atlas mountains. Our first stop was for a camel ride. Our Berber guide led us on our camels up red tracks cut into the green hills. This was great fun. Both Adil and our Berber guide took plenty of photographs for us. We then visited a weekly Berber market and saw the different goods being traded from carpets and low tables in a field. Next stop was the women's cooperative where they make oil from the nuts of the argan tree. The women do all the work by hand and the gave us an informative demonstration. I purchased some of the argan oil and face cream. These products are remarkable, pure and far superior to their mass produced counterparts. We then continued our drive up into the mountain where we stopped at a tiny village shop to buy some lollipops and biscuits for the local children. Then, onto the highlight of our day, a meal at a Berber family's home. The food was outstanding. We ate our meal on the rooftop terrace in the sunshine looking out to the valley and the mountains. The food and the view combined made a better dining experience than any restaurant. It was a privilege to be invited into the family home. We then headed back down through the mountains and back to Marrakech. I cannot endorse this tour enough. Adil is charming company and extremely knowledgeable. He is very sincere and his respect and affinity for the Berber people is evident. Our trip was faultless and I highly recommend Adil to anyone visiting Marrakech. A memorable day."

We found reviews here by chance, and after reading what others had to say, we immediately contacted Adil, who promptly responded to our various questions. My husband and I were travelling with our 14-month old son, but this was not a problem for Adil. He picked us up on time and also had an appropriate infant car seat ready for us in his comfortable 4x4. Throughout the day Adil always checked to make sure our son was ok, for example that the sun was not in streaming into his face through the car window, taking special care on the very bumpy off-road parts of the drive and generally playing with him and keeping him entertained. We really appreciated this. It was clear to us that Adil is a reliable and genuine tour guide who shows great care and respect for the Berber people. We firstly visited the Berber market which was fascinating - the scenery of the mountains and stream as we crossed the bridge to the market along with the locals was really something special. We really enjoyed seeing the range of goods on sale at the market and watching the bustle of the locals trading. We then stopped for the camel ride - we had requested to just have a photo opportunity rather than a whole ride and the local camel men kindly helped us with getting our 14-month old son up on to the camel with me for the photo and then safely down again. He loved it - it was such a fun experience and done with care to ensure our son was safe. The camels are a very exciting highlight even if you just do a quick photo opportunity.We then headed to the Argan oil women's cooperative and on up into the mountains. Adil kindly stopped for us at a small village shop on our way up the mountains, so that we could buy chocolate bars and footballs to give to the village children we met. You come across up to 70 children so it is worth bringing enough for everyone - some of the children we came across were on their own out in the middle of nowhere, working to keep a watch on the animals on the land below. It was nice to be able to offer these children something to play with and to eat. Adil always had a personal conversation with the children, who know him and listen to what he says. If you have room in your suitcase, contact Adil to find out what other items would be appreciated (eg clothing or school supplies).As others have written, the absolute highlight was having the lunch at the Berber family's home - it is an honour to have the chance to visit a home and to gain an insight into different cultural lifestyles. The food was absolutely outstanding - we really enjoyed it, as did our 14-month old son! You don't need to be worried about if the food is safe to eat etc - of course it is! It was so fresh and delicious, everything is grown locally and it was excellent. It was a real highlight to enjoy this food whilst sitting on their patio in the glorious sun, overlooking the mountains. We can highly recommend this tour! We felt the tour offered excellent value - it was a fantastic day. Adil is a great guy and he will ensure you have a wonderful and memorable experience."

All were worth doing but the highlight of the day was the journey up high into the hills and lunch in the Berber village. Yahya knew loads of great vantage points to take photos and the scenery was stunning. At times we were higher than the clouds and basking in the sunshine.

We visited two valleys which had breathtaking views and the trip gave us a real insight into how the locals live in this area, Adil stopped whenever we liked (and it was safe to do so of course) to let us take photographs.Adil is friendly and very knowledgeable about the area and it was lovely to have our own private guide, it really is worth it so please book with Adil if you are thinking of doing a tour like this one. At one point we saw a whole coach party going up the mountains and they had to stop as their bus couldn't go any further because the roads are too narrow, but we could in the 4x4! The coach party tour were all part of a huge group but we were sitting by the river enjoying a mint tea with Adil, this made us really appreciate the fact that we had booked a private tour with Adil rather than an impersonal group tour.We visited some ladies who make Argan Oil and we had a look around the shop and we able to take some photos with the ladies. The relationship that Adil has with the locals is lovely to see and from what we understand he keeps his eyes and ears open on his visits and if there is anyone that needs a little extra helping hand he takes clothes and sweets and toys as gifts. The adults and the children clearly love him! It really was nice to see such compassion and next time we will bring a whole load of clothes as it was amazing to see how gratefully received these items were. We also really enjoyed the camel ride which took about 20 minutes, the guide was very nice and his camels seemed very well looked after. The camels were also suprisingly comfortable (!).The best part of our day was having dinner at a Berber family's house. The house was very basic inside and it was amazing to see when we are used to so many creature comforts ourselves, the hospitality and the food were second to none and we had dinner and drank mint tea with spectacular views over the valley which was a really great experience and one which we thoroughly enjoyed. Thank you Adil!!!"

On holiday we always like to get out and see some of the country we are visiting and prefer to find a local company than do trips via our holiday reps. This was definitely the right decision \u2013 what can be better than a tour with your own personal guide, than herded with the masses of coach parties?! We were able to make stops for photos whenever we asked and ask many questions. There are many reviews of Adil on here and at first I was slightly disappointed that he was unable to take us on our chosen day as it seems most reviews are about him. However we should not have worried though as we had a great day with Yahya and it seems whichever driver/guide you have you will be in safe hands. As everyone else has said, we communicated by email to Adil who replied quickly and with a suggested itenary, including Berber Market, Argan Oil Co-operative, Camel ride and lunch at family house and we also requested that we include a trip to the local school which Adil advised could be included. (Yahya kindly took us to two schools). After reading previous reviews and advice from Adil we took lots of pens, pencils, colouring books and notebooks, small toys, sweets, a few childrens clothes and footballs! We gave many items to the schools but as you climb the mountains you will also see lots of children who you can give sweets etc to and they are so appreciative of them. I cannot really add more about the day because everyone has mentioned the views, the safe driving etc other than to mention that the food in the Berber house was fantastic (although you could chose a restaurant instead we were so glad we didn\u2019t). Do not have any worries about the cleanliness or quality of the meal, I do not like spicy food so was slightly worried about this, but the food was delicious, fresh and flavoursome without being spicy and served by very friendly hosts. Even thoughit was February and there was snow high on the mountains it was warmer than we expected so we enjoyed our lunch on the terrace in the sun overlooking the mountains. On arrival Adil was already at the house with another group of 4 female guests\u2026.one of them mentioned it was her birthday. After the meal the most gorgeous birthday cake arrived for her (I believe very kindly organised by Adil)\u2026 and we also got to share this, so thank you very much. I have nothing other to add as I feel everyone has said everything about the trips in other reviews, other than to say thank you Adil and especially Yahya and don\u2019t hesitate just contact Adil and book a wonderful day out!! Next time we visit we would love to do an overnight trip to go further into the desert and will definitely contact Camel 4 x 4 for this trip"

Another thing, stop at a supermarket before the tour to buy chocolate and school material for the kids you will see along the way, because they will stop the car to ask for it, and they certainly need it more than you need the money, so don\u00b4t be cheap.

His responses were very professional and prompt.Adil arrived at our riad on time and led us to his clean and comfortable 4x4 Toyota Land Cruiser. His English is excellent and he is very chatty and interesting and we were soon at our ease.We had requested a short camel ride (typical tourists!) and we spent 20 minutes riding safely off the road on some open land. It was good fun and the camel handlers were very friendly.After this we headed to the Ourika valley which is very beautiful. Adil suggested calling in to the Argan oil women's co-operative - interesting but be careful not to get carried away and spend lots (we did!).Adil had arranged a local guide, Mustapha, to take us on a walk to some waterfalls. He was very helpful and assisted the less fit members of the group to climb up. We recommend that you wear walking boots and we took coats and jumpers but didn't need them even though it was February. There are a number of local people selling tourist souveniers on the way and some people might find it a little over commercialised. We went on a one and half hour walk to the closest waterfalls which were pretty but not overly spectacular, however it was an enjoyable walk and well worth doing.We then headed off-road over the mountains to a Berber village for lunch. We stopped to hand out sweets, paper and pencils to many children along the way, most of whom Adil seemed to know. The Berber family that Adil had arranged for us to visit were very friendly and welcomed us into their home. The father is the local Imam and speaks a little French. The view from the terrace where we ate lunch was spectacular. We were served a tomato and onion salad with bread, a chicken tagine, vegetable couscous, fresh fruit and mint tea. It was delicious!We would highly recommend this trip - it was enjoyed by every member of the family including stroppy teenagers! It was the highlight of our visit to Marrakech, and although it may seem expensive, at the end of the adventure we felt we'd had excellent value for money."

Adil picked us up promptly at 9am at our hotel. He then took us to a Berber market where we saw so many interesting things. We even got to meet the local doctor. Then it was off to ride camels! This was so much fun and the setting was breath taking! Our guide for the camel ride offered to stop several times to take our picture. We also stopped at an Argan oil cooperative where we saw first hand how the famous Argan oil is made. The women even invited me to sit down with them to help. Next was lunch at a Berber family's house. This was fantastic! We got to see first hand how they live. We enjoyed a delicious lunch of chicken tangine, couscous, tea, water and sweet oranges. Hands down the best meal we had in Morocco! We enjoyed riding through the two valleys and through our journey, children would be waiting for Adil's vehicle to come by. It was fun handing out lollipops to the children. They appreciated it, but I wish I had brought three times as many because I ran out. I highly recommend this tour with Adil. It was a private tour, just my husband and I. Adil's 4x4 was very comfortable and Adil speaks excellent English. Thanks for a fabulous time, Adil!"

We were picked up from our hotel on time and were safley driven throughout the day. Our first stop was a Burbere market which was an experience and a great assault on the senses! Then on up to the mountains where on the way we stopped to purchase a traditional clay tagine. Next stop an opportunity to see argan oil being produced with the chance to purchase the product along with other locally produced ointments. Continuing our journey we were given information about the areas we travelled through and stopped in order to take in the views and photographs.Highlight of the day was a visit to a Burbere family home for lunch of a chicken tagine which was eaten on a terrace with a fantastic view of the Atlas mountains capped with snow. highly reccomended trip."

Adil was waiting for us on the day at our hotel and we had a fantastic but educational day. We also got to meet the local families and children (take pencils, pens, clothes and anything else).The market was a step back in time and definitely not Tescos pre-packed and a good reminder of where our meat comes from!The meal we had with a local family was very nice and humbling to see how the Burbere live and survive day to day.Adil was very knowledgeable, compassionate and professional and I highly recommend this trip, nothing was to much of a problem for him and if you would like to do something different to the itinery, just say."

Instead of focusing on the places where all the tourists were, he took us off the road to meet the Berber people. Adil clearly cares about these people and urges you to bring pencils and paper for the children, each of which he knows personally. The second day, we went with Adil's friend Amine to cross the Tichka pass towards Ait Benhaddou, a very long and incredibly impressive day. Both Adil as well as Amine know a lot about their country, and they are smart, helpful, and funny. We will always remember these two days."

First stop the market - an eye opener - particularly the meat section! We then set off into the Ourika Valley passing beautiful streams and landscape with our amazingly friendly guide and driver. We stopped and bought a tagine at a bargain price of about \u00a38 and then stopped at the Argan co-operative where we tasted and brought some argan oil. Then on more beautiful drives through stunning scenery and stopping for lunch with a local Berber family. We are so pleased we chose to do this. The meal and setting were absolutely wonderful and we felt welcome and well looked after. The food was delicious and plentiful. We set off again and saw more wonderful countryside and had lots of information given to us. For us this was the highligh of our time in Marrakesh. We cannot recommend highly enough to book this trip - you won't regret it and it will be a wonderful day. Thank you Adil for organising this and to our wonderful driver (so sorry can't remember his name :( but he was fantastic)!."

Adil took us to a women's co operative where they make and sell Argan oil and then on up into the mountains where we had a fantastic walk. Adil drops you off and you then walk for an agreed amount of time. He then comes and picks you up and you drive on through the mountains making stops for photos of the amazing scenery. We arrived at a Berber village for the best meal we had whilst in Morocco. Lunch was a fabulous Moroccan salad with bread and olive oil, followed by chicken tagine and vegetable cous cous with oranges for desert. Lunch was eaten whilst admiring the beautiful mountain scenery....wonderful!We saw places on this trip that you could never see by taking a taxi into the mountains. Some of the roads we went on were only passable by 4x4 or donkey and very off the beaten track. I would highly recommend this trip. It is a fascinating insight into life in the mountain villages informed by a very knowledgable guide. The scenery is amazing on the remote mountain roads and the tranquility of the mountains is also a very welcome relief from the mayhem of Marrakech."

On the second day we were picked up from our Riad by Azziz, one of the drivers employed by Adil, the owner of 4x4 Camel. We were very impressed by the reviews on Trip Advisor and after an exhilarating day spent in the Atlas Mountains we both felt that the reviews provide a very accurate description of this wonderful experience of hidden Morocco. The highlight of the many highlights was the opportunity to have lunch with the Berber family in a remote mountain village. The food was the best we had on our trip and the view from our outdoor lunch table overlooking the snow clad Atlas mountain range was amazing. The 4x4 experience is an absolute must for anyone visiting Marrakech and will provide lifetime memories of a unique glimpse of the real Morocco away from the tourist treadmill."

His responses were fast and he was very helpful as we decided what type of tour would best fit our family. He was early to our hotel and ready for our adventure. We took a tour through the Atlas Mountains to Skoura with stops at some kasbahs and for shopping and a camel ride. He was aways helpful and informative and worked very hard to ensure that we were having a good time. The kasbah we stayed at in Skoura was lovely and the food was amazing. In addition to our lovely tour, I was struck by how much Adil cared for the people of the Berber villages. He brought along some small gifts for the children and he obviously cared for these hard working people. He never minded an additional stop (it is a long way through the mountains) and he helped us barter on our purchases which we appreciated. Upon getting back to Marrakech, he made sure that the staff of our Riad was there to meet us and that we were all set. If you want a well organized, pleasant and interesting tour of Marrakech, call Adil!"

Because it\u2019s not a tourist place we felt an authentic local colour. Picturesque scenery of Ourika Valley and breath taking landscape of Atlas make your camera very busy. But be careful when you taking photos from camel back:). My wife couldn\u2019t have been more excited to stroke a baby camel.Berber villages sprinkled over the mountains slopes and connected with rough, rocky paths make you realize how hard is to live there. Berber kids appear on twisty roads hoping you brought some treats. It was amazing to see smile on these little faces when they thanked you for crayons or sweets. Some of them didn\u2019t know what sticker was.Lunch in one of these villages with Berber family was definitely a highlight of our trip. Fantastic scenery and delicious authentic local food give you a real taste of Atlas Mountains and local culture. Chicken tajine we had there was the best we\u2019ve tried in Morocco and I\u2019ve tried loads. Our guide Yahya couldn\u2019t have been better guide. Very helpful and informative. His knowledge of local culture, history and architecture is impressive. Most of the time he was anticipating our questions giving us a precise explanation. We felt very safe with him and more like with friend showing us around then a hired guide. It was a big shame we didn\u2019t have enough time to go for a Ozoud Cascades excoursion with 4x4 Camel.  Thoroughly enjoyed our trip, it was better than we had imagined! Aggi and Mariusz"

We found Adil through a friend who had been on a trip last year. We started the day travelling towards the Atlas Mountains which looked beautiful. We stopped at a Berber Market which was fascinating , a usually men only sort of place very few women there. You will need to take a wrap or jacket of some sort (women that is) just to respect their culture. We went through the meat part of the market not for the faint hearted as I don't think I or my sister will look at a camel in the same light again!! The turkeys could have feed a small thur world country! They were that big! Lol. We also visited the Argan oil co operative where the ladies sit all day and make the argen oil from the fruits of the tree. Very interesting to learn about it. We also went to the Berber village and had lunch at a typical Berber Home. The lunch was totally delicious and well worth visiting. The whole atmosphere was fantastic it was so quiet all we could hear were the chickens and a couple of children playing in a nearby hill. The sound of innocence was really lovely to hear. Adil was a perfect guide and very informative. As you go up into the mountains the children come to run and greet you it's a good idea to taken some packets of sweets and pens pencils to give to them. Very small items for us but the look of pure joy on the children's faces is lovely to see. The scenery is stunning and on a whole the best day for me of our holiday. They best meal too!!! I would totally recommend Adil and 4x4 Camel as a guide and friendly guy. Brilliant time thank you Adil . He was also the one who told us about Maison MK which is a fabulous restaurant. See my other review on that one!"

Adil the driver and guide was able to converse easily in english and swapped to french when we wanted to try ours out. He took us to a really interesting berber market where only men shop ( all the women are doing the backbreaking work in the fields) all forms of food, alive and dead, are on sale and where the most busy shop was the one selling mobile phones! Amazing to see subsistence farming in the terraces of the Atlas mountains but with every 600 year old mud and straw house being the pedestal for a giant satellite dish! Go figure....We had a wonderful tagine at a berber house at a tiny village where the only sound you could hear was the bleating of a herd of sheep from the next hillside. When adil was stopped by a crowd of boys we were able to leave them with a $2 soccer ball so they could play a game of football on the mountaintops. They were enthralled! We also bought a carpet from cooperative (La source de Tapis) and some argan oil and peanut butter from a cooperative of women who only employed divorced or seperated women so as to provide them with an income and some self esteem. Really interesting trip from many perspectives particulary the scenery and the entree into the world of the berber farmers. Can't recommed it more highly"

The views from the drive into the mountains were amazing and Adil was great at letting us stop for several photo opportunities. We opted not to have lunch with the local family and instead ate at L'Oliveraie de Marigha which provided the most spectacular scenery for devouring a great tagine.I'd definitely contact Adil again on my next trip to Marrakech, it was the highlight of our stay and provides some great memories."

On way back we stopped at Berber Market and was blown away with the market doctor and barber who will also pull your teeth! In conclusion, Adil was a truly inspiring man with his local knowledge and the good work he does for the really poor Berber family. I seriously cannot recomend this day out enough if you want to see the \"real Morocco\" and not what tour operators offer. We will be in touch with Adil on our next vist."

This review os for a 3-day desert trip to Merzouga.First of all, it seems like they are 4 drivers working together, so even if you make correspondance with Adil, you might get another driver.Our driver was Yahya, an adult man of app.50 years old (just guessing), but even though we didn't have much in common (we are a couple in early 30'ies), our 3-day desert trip was great. Adil called us on the last day in order to check up if everything was allright - this is nice customer service indeed.The correspondance with Adil was fast and effiecient. His prices are reasonable, and accommodations offered were great. The best thing for us was that we didn't have to pay any deposits for the trip in advance. Many other tour companies require this.Our driver Yahya was very good in English, he drove carefully (except the last 1-2 hours, where everybody just wanted to get back to Marrakech after sitting in a car for 10 hours). He showed us the sights that were worth seeing, the nature was indeed amazing. He was also very flexible with stops under our request. We stopped at many tourist sights, and all tours were booked for us in advance - at no time we had to wait for a guide. Very proffesionalThe best part of this trip was of course the desert itself. We were astonished by the level of accommodation in the middle of nowhere. Seriously, after an hour on a camel back, you reach a 4-tent camp of amazing standard. You get a room with normal beds, clean white sheets and towels, plenty of blankets, normal toilet and even normal shower, if you wish!Everything wass very clean both inside and outside, people running the camp were welcoming and friendly. Dinner was very good, it was served nicely, and there was plenty of it (I think we got like 4 dishes, one of them is traditional tagine, which was the best of what I had tasted before).We can totally recommend this trip with 4x4 Camel. So one more great reccommendation for this company on TA:)"

We booked our trip with Adiel (sorry for spelling?!) whilst in Marrakech, especially as the trip similar offered with Thomson was much more expensive, with more people and included less, and also based on great reviews online. My husband organised it all via email and along with myself and his parents we were collected by Adiel at our hotel a couple of days later at 9am - one thing I'd say is to book to avoid disappoint,net, we were lucky as we were there in December when it's a little quieter. Once we were picked up we were given options of what to do - Adiel was flexible with what we would like to do which made it more personal - waterfall or mountains. We picked mountains which took us via Berber markets, shops to stop off along the way to buy carpets/tagines etc if you wanted to then lunch. We were asked where we would like to go for lunch, restaurant or a family's home in a Berber village in the Atlas mountains, we picked the latter which was THE BEST decision! The view, the food and the lovely opportunity to visit such a nice family was great and far better than any restaurant could've been. This was 50dh each but 3 course with mint tea - I'd have paid double though. Adiel is an amazing guy. Very friendly genuine and will look after you. He's also very kind and encourages you, with no obligation, to bring some paper/pens/sweets/clothing/soaps etc for the kids who have very little that we pass on the way up the mountain. Do this trip if nothing else while in Marrakech - it was our highlight :)"

He firstly took us to a traditional berber market, which was a great experience and a real eye opener. People had started queing outside of a little tin/mud hut, Adil explained that they were waiting for the local doctor. After the market we started to move up into the mountains - stopping on the way at the Argan Oil Co-operative (where only local women work), ofcourse I had to indulge as it was so lovely on the skin and not greasy at all.I explained to Adil that I loved crystal and rocks. He kindly stopped at another shop on the way up the mountains where they had the most gorgeous crystals e.g. amethyst etc, I ended up buying a large crystal and a lovely fossil - all apparently found throughout the atlas mountains. Adil really catered the trip to anything that we wanted to see.I had taken with me some pencils and sweets for the local children. They were so cute - and excited at receiving some sweets. Adil introduced us to the local school, were we had the opportunity to meet the children and give the pencils to them. I would have loved to have took my kids on this trip as it would have opened their eyes to how little these kids have and yet how happy they seem.The last part of the day was eating with a berber family - the food was great and the lady even made an omellette for my husband as he doesn't eat spicy food - it was such a great experience.Thanks Adil - it was fabulous - I would highly reccomend this trip to anyone and everyone.If there is one trip you do in Marrakesh - make sure its this one.

This cream is the best cream you will ever buy. The day was one of the best days we have ever had. The scenery is amazing and with Aziz's knowledge it was incredibly interesting. The lunch at the Berber family home was the tastiest we had had in Marrakech and they were also very friendly.

We will be going back to Marrakech and will definitely be in contact with Adil to either do the same trip again or whatever else he has to offer. Great, Great, Great."

We stayed in the medina, and the most relaxing day by far was with Aadil. He took us through the valleys and the mountains, let us ask him a million questions about Islam, introduced us to amazing women making argan oil, brought us on our great camel journey and to lunch at a Berber home. Even though he must do this trip very often, it does not feel like this at all. He is such a sweet man and was fluent to converse with us in both English and French, which was great. He obviously has an incredible relationship with the Berber people and we (3 women from 27-33) felt totally in awe of him and his work that he does to help the Berber children especially. I felt incredibly lucky to be in the presence of someone who gives so much fo himself and shared so much of his culture with us Americans and Brits. Absolutely, above and beyond the best thing in Morocco was Adil. We are all professional tour guides and for us to be impressed is pretty difficult, and we were not only THOROUGHLY impressed but also changed from our experiences with these amazing people. :-)"

We were picked up from our hotel by the welcoming Yaya, in a comfortable 4 x 4 and whisked away to the Atlas mountains. Yaya was so full of information as we drove and answered many of the questions we had about Morocco and Marrakesh. The roads are unexpectedly good and we made swift progress.Our first stop was to a women\u2019s cooperative to see how Argan oil was made. This was so interesting and the women were just so nice and welcoming. The additional benefit was that the oil was of great quality and much cheaper than in the UK. From there we went up into the mountains. The scenery was spectacular and the people very welcoming. Words cannot really describe this trip. Being in the 4x4 we travelled through many areas that are in accessible to many vehicles. Yaya stopped anywhere we wanted to stop and take a picture or just enjoy the scenery, also he stopped and pointed out many beautiful and interesting things. Occasionally some sellers would come around the 4x4 and try to sell necklaces etc. Yaya was good at stopping them being too pushy, but was also good at bartering to get you a good price. The scenery is just breath taking and I found it amazing that the villages were almost invisible until you got up close.We walked a bit and just took in the fresh air and the whole ambience, as we got higher towards the snow covered peaks. At lunch time we went to a Berber village and to the home of family for a traditional meal. The family were welcoming and we had the best meal ever, after being showed around the home and taking in the view from their terrace.We continued taking in the wonderful scenery and went down the mountains to a Berber market, before going back to our hotel.Wow, what a day! The whole day was very informative, entertaining and emotional. If you only take one trip whilst in Morocco, do this one. Yaya was so informative and such a nice guy. The tour was very personal, as it was just the two of us, with Yaya, which made us feel very special, almost like royalty. I do not remember ever spending such a wonderful day. I don\u2019t know what I expected, but this trip excelled any expectations. I would like to say a big thank you to Yaya for our day and to Adil for organising it."

We emailed Aadil the day before we wanted to go the atlas mountains and he replied within the hour and we had organised the day within a few hours. A colleage of his took us around for the day - he was lovely and very knowledgeable about Morocco. The food we had at a Berber house was definitely the best Moroccan food we have had so far! Definitely recommend 4x4 camel and have thoroughly enjoyed the day!"

We went in one 4 wheel driven car. Super private tour. He spoke fairly good english and told us about berber life and history. We asked for a coffee break and stopped at a beautiful kasbah , in one of the vallys. Toilet visits at various exotic places..( bring paper). Our visit to the argan female cooperate was very interesting - with lots of purchases.The camel ride was fun and exciting. The tour to the vallys and berber villages was breathtaking. Lunch at a berber home will always be remembered. Delicious food, nice and clean. Bring some chocolate for the children. Also writing material is apreciated and warm clothes. They have nothing and the driver will distribute to the various schools and children. An unforgetable trip and a must when in Marrakesh.This tour is highly recommended with 4x4 Camel. You will not be disappointed."

We arranged our day with Adil here in the UK, Adil replied promplty to e.mails and it was really easy to set things up, he is a really friendly guy. Driving our of Marrakech we soon came across smaller villages, and stopped after about half an hour for our camel ride, which Adil had arranged for us. This was a great taster, with views over Marrakech and the mountains behind, we all enjoyed it. Adil asked us to pay the camel owner directly which we thought was good. The Ourika valley we drove through was really beautiful, and the Argan oil co-operative was an interesting place to stop for half an hour. What we enjoyed the most was being in the villages of the Atlas Mountains, stopping for the children who recognized Adil's car, and raced each other down the hill to see what we had brought for them. Adil had a great collection of bouncy balls and hair bands to add to our sweets that we handed out as we journeyed through. The Berber lunch was fantastic. We sat on their terrace overlooking the mountains drinking mint tea, and enjoying the fresh, delightful food. Again we paid the family directly for this, and Adil explained how much this money is helping the family to invest in their home, which is still very simple. Our afternoon was spent exploring other villages, there are no markets on Wednesdays, so we didn't get to experience the madness of that. Instead we explored more places off the beaten track. It was get out of the city, and in a small way help the people trying to earn a living in the mountains. Adil is doing a great job."

We arranged our trip using email whilst already in Marrakesh, luckily Adil was free on the Thursday and we made arrangements to meet as our Riad was in the Kasbah.Adil was punctual, as were we, and that was the start of the best day of our week in Morocco.I've read the other reviews and was aware that anything I write wouldn't do justice to just how much I enjoyed the day. There were 5 of us, ages 66, 39, 38, 13 and 4.We asked for a camel ride, our 4 year old was desperate, Adil's choice was a perfect location, 100 Dirhams each for a 20 minute ride in an area with nice views.There is a caveat to enjoying the day, this is in the form of the spice and oil stores/co-ops that you come across on the way to the Atlas.All of these places, no matter which one you stop in, are tourist traps. As long as you appreciate that before you set off, you'll feel better about them.Spend a bit of cash on some spices (prices are cheaper than a supermarket in the UK) and drink some mint tea.In the Arkan Oil co-op, I recommend the Almond Nut Butter (sandwich spread), although it is expensive.Then a drive into the mountains, there had been some destructive floods the day before and the drive through the devastation was sobering, but we did get a chance for a bit of proper 4x4ing in Adil's Land Cruiser.Then we drive through the Berber villages, as we'd arranged the trip whilst in Marrakesh, we hadn't been able to act on Adil's advice to bring up some old kids clothes. We took some biscuits for the Berber kids and felt completely inadequate at my efforts, I could have brought so much more. I ended up rummaging around in my bag for packets of mints or apples to give the kids. I apologise to the lad that got my Trebor Strong Mints..Giving away a few items of clothes my daughter wouldn't have worn again was just too little effort on our part.Then to the Berber family and lunch, genuinely the best meal I had in Morocco. The chicken tagine was stunningly tasty, fresh couscous and warm bread.I enjoyed the meal so much I paid twice, the least I could do.The 135Euro price tag for Adils driving was good value, especially as there were 5 of us.We will return to Marrakesh again next year and will contact Adil again, if only to take a suitcase full of clothes for the kids in the mountains.A beautiful day, stunning scenery and Adil is excellent company. But also a day to make my kids realise the privileged life they live and a day to remind me not to take what I have for granted."

The market where the locals shopped, the women making the argan oil, the children and eating in a berber home. In addition to this Adil has a real heart for helping people, the women in the factory, the family cooking the meal and what a delight to see the excited children when they recognised the van!

We recently travelled to Marrakech for a short weekend break and booked this trip in advance following the positive reviews on trip advisor.Dealing with Adil via email was easy to do and as promised our driver was there to meet us at our Riad door at 9am (which is rare in itself as many tours refuse to collect directly from Riads!)I must admit that we were a little nervous about the tour as the thought of a private trip can sometimes be a bit pressured and we worried that the lunch in the Berber home would also be put on for show, but this was definitely not the case. The tour was very well organised and timed and although there is a lot of driving involved, it didn't feel too tiring. I often get travel sick especially when driving on winding roads but I was fine for the while journey.The weather was unfortunately very grey and wet for our tour but this did not dampen the atmosphere at all and to be honest enabled us to see how some of the more remote villages cope in the wetter weather. I would however recommend taking some sensible walking shoes as the ground can be quite muddy around the village market and around the Berber homes. Our guide provided us with some helpful insight into the villages and village life and I would recommend asking lots of questions. The optional camel ride for me was the only slightly negative point as the camels were at the side of the main road but this is optional and you don't need to do this as you pay extra for it. Another optional extra is having lunch in a Berber home. This is an option that you must definitely do. The welcome and hospitality was quite shy but the food was amazing. Definitely tastier than anything we had eaten in restaurants in town. It was lovely to see a local home and cooking techniques and it did not feel awkward or uncomfortable at all. Adil offers a range of different tours in Morocco and therefore if you fancy doing something a bit different I would recommend speaking to him first (I promise I'm not on commission!)This is a definite must do for anyone travelling to Marrkech."

I researched many Atlas mountain trips and decided to go with Camel 4x4 as it seemed different to all the other trips and indeed it was the highlight of our holiday. Adil picked us up at the Riad - a very difficult place to find! and took us towards the mountains. We started our day out with a camel ride. A lot of laughter ensued. We then travelled to the Argon Cooperative which was very interesting - make sure you have plenty of euros - proper Argon oil. Avoid buying some in the Souks. Travelling off road and then following winding roads we travelled further into the mountains. We hardly saw another sight seeing tour - fantastic. We stopped for lots of photos and Adil was very informative. He has a great love for the Berbers and does a lot for the local school. Children came running when they saw his car. We stopped at the local school and watched how the teachers taught their classes whilst one lady even had her own toddler with her to look after. Adil brought books and chalk for the school. Unfortunately we forgot to bring books and pens for them, please make sure you bring some if the can, you can see where they will be put to good use. Lunch at the Berber family house was lovely. Very tasty food, and to experience the local culture was fantastic. Again you can see how your money can make a difference to the family, increasing the size of the house and a 'proper' kitchen. Travelling back in the comfort of the car we saw stunning scenery and snow topped mountains (and the Branson family Kasbah - from a distance). If you decide on a trip to the Atlas mountains I absolutely recommend this one. Adil is lovely and quickly replied to my emails. Fabulous day out. Please be careful when looking for camel 4x4 as someone is using a very similar name. This is the site you want."

We started our trip camel riding (which was a lot of fun - definitely worth it!) before heading up the mountains and visiting a local Berber market and then onto a local Argon oil cooperative. After some off-road driving up the mountains we went to a local village where we were treated to a wonderful lunch with a Berber family, by far the best meal we had during our time in Marrakech. I really could not recommend Adil and 4x4 Camels anymore highly: we thoroughly enjoyed our day tip - Adil was kind and informative and the trip to the Atlas Mountains was breathtaking and interesting.

We met many Berbers, enjoying a frisbee toss with two adorable little girls at one of our stops, as well as a stop at a cooperative selling argon oil, another cooperative where we purchased a rug, and great places to eat. Based on interactions with other travelers that we met, that were having some digestive issues, we were more than pleased that Adil took us to places where we had no problems with the food. Although we unfortunately did not get a chance to eat with a Berber family like other clients of Adil, the food was just incredible. At one place adjacent to a centuries old kasbah, we had a chicken tagine with black figs (a combination I did not think I would like) that added a nice sweet flavor to the chicken. Adil was the perfect guide, and it was a rewarding experience learning about the Berber culture and enjoying the breathtaking countryside. Adil was very knowledgeable and made the trip fun and relaxing. Anyone planning a trip to Marrakech should consider taking a day tour with Adil."

One of the highlights is the reaction from the local children as you drive through the mountains. They all recognise Adil. We had taken some crayons and colouring books which we passed around, along with clothes and sweets that Adil had. We returned to our hotel very tired but relaxed just after 4pm.

We were not disappointed at all - it was the highlight of my Marrakech city break. We were picked up promptly from our hotel in Adil's 4x4 and taken to the market which was an insight into Berber life that we never would have got on our own. It was fascinating to see people going about their day to day lives and we were able to buy some stationery supplies for the Berber children. Adil also arranged a camel ride around some scenic parts. One of my favourite parts of the day was lunch in the home of 2 ladies in the village - delicious food in a homely setting. We also saw the oil cooperative and Adil even made a special stop at a roadside tagine pot seller to get us a good deal on the pots we had said we wanted. The scenery was stunning and there were plenty of opportunities to stop on request for photos. Adil's personal support for the local community and his own donations of supplies along the way was touching. A piece of advice for anyone going is to try to get enough sweets/rubber/sharpeners at the market for the approx 40 children you see along the way as we didn't quite get enough not knowing and then wished we had more when we saw more children who were clearly very appreciative of any supply donations for their education.Overall I look back at the day as my favourite part of the trip and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a day out of the hustle and bustle of Marrakech to see how the Berber families live and to get some experiences that you'd struggle to get alone. Thank you Adil for a great time."

Thanks again Adil for a great day out, anyone who is visting marrakesh I would highly recommed this trip."

We contacted Adil the day before we wanted to do his day trip to the Atlas Mountains, he arranged his colleague to take us, we had a thoroughly enjoyable and educational day. We took sweets for the children and also crayons, pencils and writing pads, although we didn't get to visit the school as it was a saturday and they finished early, but 'Yaya' (our guide, not his correct name, as we couldn't pronounce it) said he would ensure that the school received them. The trip was leisurely, we could stop for photos whenever we wanted, the lunch at the Berber home was delicious, we were lucky enough to stop at a local regional market day and have a tour around it, that was amazing, very busy, loud, and fun. I would recommend this tour to anyone holidaying in Marrakech."

My partner and I booked this trip after reading all the brilliant reviews, and after 3 hectic days in Marrakech this was the perfect chilled out mountain experience we were after for our final day.. Adil's Colleague Yaha picked us up from our Riad promptly at at 9am.. We were then whisked off in his extremely comfortable 4x4..The whole day was chilled out, the scenery was incredible, the pictures dont do it justice.. Yaha was informative about the Berber culture, we looked around the market, the Argan oil Co Op, & had a delicious home cooked meal in a family home way up in the mountains..will definatley be in contact with Adil & Yaha on return to Marrakech in a year or so... A splendidly chilled out but informative trip with lovely people :)"

Adil has gone to great lengths to support local communities and show you real morocco. The lunch we ate with the burner family was the best we had all holiday and it was great to see the money they were making, being used to improve their home. we forgot to bring things for the children and really regretted it! We had a truly memorable day and highly reccomend Adil. Book now :)"

We rode camels, went to an argan oil cooperative and visited a berber village and market. The meal at the village was the best we had all holiday, cooked with beautiful fresh ingredients. Yahya himself was very interesting to talk to and you could tell he had a real emotional attachment to the mountains and the people there. He was kind and informative all day and we felt very safe in the 4x4 with him. We had been concerned it might be a bit of a hair-raising day but it genuinely wasn't - only an enlightening and unforgettable insight into Berber culture."

We booked a day trip tot he Atlas mountains with Adil whilst we out in Marrakech based on the other fantastic reviews on this site - and we weren't disappointed. Our trip was with one of Adil's partners Aziz although we did meet up with Adil on the trip. Both Adil and Aziz were friendly, spoke very good English and were great tour guides - explaining the culture, places and areas usually unseen by tourists. The trip was fantastic value for money and truly insightful, we got to ride a camel, visit a local market and Argan oil co-operative as well as visit a local village where we had lunch in a family home - which was delicious!! Try your best to get supplies for the children - we took notepads and pens but wished we had a football or two to hand out. All in all this is one thing you must do if you visit Marrakech!!!"

As mentioned in most other reviews ours followed a similar routing although opting not to go on the camels. I won't go too much into each section as most other reviews explain this thoroughly but the whole trip was well routed, with each section providing great information, amazing views and scenery, interesting people and tasty food in the middle (vegetarians be sure to mention to Adil prior to the trip). What I found most refershing about the trip was what Adil puts back into the local community. With a boot full of clothes exported from England he regularly stops to give to local people whilst advising us to bring sweets along for the kids. Although just a gesture he does whilst on his trip it's amazing to see the appreciation on the faces of people who have close to nothing. I couldn't recommend the trip more."

I agree with other reviewers' comments - Adil was a very friendly guide & this tour was a good insight into seeing another side to Morocco, usually unseen by tourists. Some of the tour was a bit touristy - the Argan Oil co-operative was all set up for tourists but the visit to the Berber village was excellent. It gave my family a chance to see life in the 3rd world at first hand. The meal we had of tomatoes, couscous, chicken tagine & melon was very simple but absolutely delicious - better than a similar one we had later in the holiday at an expensive riad restaurant. It was lovely to meet all the children & were glad we had taken 30 gifts as they all went ! Adil was very accommodating & informative. He did spend a lot of time on his phones while driving but we felt safe & would recommend his services to anyone visiting Marrakech but not wanting to pay hotel prices. Our tour was 140 euros & 30 euros for the meal & 30 euros for the camel ride.Shukran (thank you) Adil !"

His English wasn't as good as Adil's but it wasn't a real problem either. We still enjoyed our day through the Atlas mountains and the Berber village. Going in August when the heat could be extremely unbearable at times, the cool breezes from the mountains and the river was a great break. For this day trip, Yaya arrived promptly and took us to see where the Argon oil was made. There, we met up with Adil and his group. The women who work to make the oil were very opened to show us the products and even let us attempt at breaking nuts. It was also a great place for pictures. Since the market was closed due to the first day of Eid, our guide and Adil took us hiking to see a nearby waterfall. It was nice to cool off but my only suggestion would be is to where a good pair of shoes equipped for trekking and climbing over slippery rocks. Sneakers are fine. The meal at the Berber home was excellent. Very tasty and plenty to go around. Like the previous reviews said, be ready to have children approach you. We brought some soccer balls but wished we could have brought more. Overall this excursion is a must. It is a great experience which my husband I enjoyed very much and it could not have been done without a guide."

We then headed the local berber market which was great to see and they didnt hassle you like in the medina. The atlas mountains were stunning, so many opportunties for photographs. We stopped at a carpet shop, where we not pressured to buy anything but the views from the balcony were stunning and the owner was a very nice man. For an extra 100 Dirhams we enjoyed a camel ride at the bottom of the atlas mountains, it was fab! We visited the argan oil co-operative where we watched the women make this and learnt about the different products. The products were not particulary cheap but your not forced to buy anything and we enjoyed this experience. We took sweets, colouring books and crayons for the children but we wish we had taken some more sweets, Adil has a fantastic relationship with the children and they are so happy to see him and grateful for the gifts. The meal with the berber family was delicious and plentiful and the money went towards developing the families house. If i could say 1 negative at all was the length of the journey and the winding roads back down the mountains on the return journey so if you get car sick take some tablets!Overall a fantastic trip during our time in morroco and Adil was a great guide. Would recommend this if you want something authentic, we had a great day!"

The company offer lots of trips but if you have only a week in Marrakech I recommend their day long Atlas mountain trip with the optional extra Camel Ride and Meal at the Berber Village.Was picked up at 930 by Adil in his 4*4 from our hotel (Al Fassia) really nice guy and nice comfy / safe vehicle. He had a good chat with us and gave us some great information that I was really interested in. We stopped for a camel ride (additional charge is about \u20ac10 each) which we both loved, give your guide your camel and he takes loads of great pics (we gave him a nice tip for this)Our second stop was the Berbere Village Market which I personally loved, its life in the raw and expect to see lots of butchers with strange meats for sale (goats legs and sheep stomachs !) There are chicks and chickens within the market that makes it looks and smell like a real part of Morocco, We spent about 30 minutes there and bought some Rocks (break open with crystal inside) and loved the rawness of the place, it makes you wonder about the 'sterile' world we live in with our plastic covered fruit and meat compared with their fly infested foods.The trip continues up the Ourika Valley which is beautiful to the Argan oil cooperative: expect to see lots of old women breaking nuts to be used to create the oil that is used within foods and massage oil. I found this interesting and we ended up buying soap / massage oils / food oil / peanut butter and honey with this oil - we paid a silly amount of money for them and I hope they are as healthy for you as they claim :) Things like this always look overpriced when you get them home but the 'tour' of the place is free and its nice to taste their bread with the oils and honey / butter.Along the route you have chance to buy sweets for the kids and recommend you do this, other things they love is empty water bottles, old clothes, pencils / balls. Apparently the very best gifts are 'runners water bottles' the ones you put your hands through as they children can hold them and climb.Lunch at the Berber village was great, good value and tasty. (additional charge is about \u20ac10 each) You are naturally worried that the hygiene standards are not the same as ours but we both thought the food was delicious (and great value) and you eat it in a nice location - love the views from this places with the chickens and sheep in the compound next to the house giving us about 20 minutes of pleasure just by feeding the animals (with bread and plumbs !)Really great trip - worth every penny and nearly considered doing it again within our 7 days. See the photos with this review that highlight the parts of the trip mentioned above.We paid in British Pounds (\u00a3) to Adil for this trip and paid in local currency for the camel ride and Berber village lunch."

Spent the day yesterday with Adil who was a great host and very friendly and cares a lot about his customers and the service he provides.We went on a Tuesday which coincidentally fell on the same day as the Berber market which he took us round. I would certainly recommend doing this as it was very interesting. Especially the meat market.The views from the top of the Atlas mountains are absolutely incredible and Adil takes you to 2 different valleys in his 4x4. There is a few extras you can opt in for on the way which is an Argan oil stop and a camel ride. We did the camel ride which was a good experience and there are some good photo opportunities.What I will never forget is being invited to the village and having a beautifully cooked meal (I won't ruin the surprise and tell you what it was) in a local Berbers house. As it was Ramadan we ate alone but I suspect usually they would eat with you. It was still nice either way. What I particularly liked about this experience is that the family make an earning from visitors eating in their home and after a brief tour of the house and a bit of history I could see the benefits of what Adil is doing. It's nice to have such a traditional experience and help a family at the same time. The thing to remember about this outing is that you can customise it to how you want but I would urge you to not bother with the restaurant and visit the Berbers instead.Thanks Adil!"

I got in touch with Adil a few days before we arrived on email and he was quick to reply and really helpful with ideas and places we could visit while in Marrakech. I chose to go with 4x4 Camel as it seemed the other tours were longer that one day and I found that when I tried to get information about the day it was difficult to fully understand what we would be doing.Adil was clear about the programe and clear about the cost too.He picked us up from our villa at 9.30 and we went off in his car towards the Atlas mountains in his 4x4. Adil was really nice, very friendly, knowledgable and made sure we did the things we wanted to do. The landscapes were beautiful and Adil told us all about the local area and conversation flowed freely.Our first stop was at the Argan oil cooperative where we saw how oil was made and what the oil was put into in the form of end products. It was quite interesting to see how women made a living and I also got to have a go too!We continued on the winding passes, Adil an excellent driver stopped along the way at various stops so that we could take photos- the landscapes were just beautiful. We drove past the Berber market and the deeper into the Berber villages.We brought some sweets from London and handed them out to the local children who were SO cute and very appreciative of the sweets.We then went into a Berber house and had a typical lunch, it was an amazing experience to be invited into a home and to experience a typical meal.Overall the whole tour was fantastic, we loved every minute of it and Adil was a great guide.We will come back and do a 2 day tour through the dessert and sleep in a tent- that would be awesome!Thanks Adil!"

When I booked a short trip to Marrakech, I truly wanted to understand a little more about Moroccan culture outside the Medina and to see the natural beauty of Morocco (and I only had a day to do it). \u00a0\u00a0All I can say after my day with Adil in the mountains is \"Don't miss this very unique opportunity.\" \u00a0The trip was easy to set up and turned out to be my most relaxing day in Morocco. \u00a0It also put my life in a little more perspective. \u00a0I emailed Adil after learning about him through Trip Advisor. \u00a0He replied to my e-mail promptly. \u00a0We scheduled our meeting time and pick up location, and he was there as committed. \u00a0He never asked me for a deposit. \u00a0In fact, he had to take me to an ATM machine on the way home. \u00a0His 4x4 was very comfortable and clean....and off we went. \u00a0His tour was a world away from my guide from the Medina the previous day. Both were wonderful in their own way, however, \u00a0Adil is very thoughtful in what he says and has a very calming demeanor, and after a day with him, his intentions are above reproach(Not something you will say about everyone you meet in the Medina). Adil is not going to talk the entire trip, but he does seem to want you to ask him questions. This does not seem to be a \"history of Morocco\" tour. \u00a0For me, this ended up more about connecting with the local people and natural beauty of the people. \u00a0\u00a0My favorite part about Adil is his care for the Berber people. \u00a0Everywhere we drove, children ran to him. He knew them all by name. He knew their ailments. \u00a0Two children who were tending goats at least 300 meters down a steep valley ran all the way up for water and a piece of candy apiece. To watch their smiling faces against the backdrop of one of the most beautiful views I have ever seen was unforgettable. \u00a0Instead of begging for money, the children in the Atlas Mountains fought over pieces of candy and pencils. \u00a0\u00a0As Adil will advise you, bring individual wrapped candies, pencils, hats, a football for the village....trust me, the authentic smiles are worth it. \u00a0\u00a0Adil does not give money to anyone in the villages. He says that you are welcome to do what you wish, but I didn't, and I would advise against it as well after having been there. \u00a0\u00a0I brought candy, but left wishing I had brought more. Adil did take me to do a quick camel ride on the way up. \u00a0\u00a0An easy 20 minutes. No drama. \u00a0\u00a0Camels seemed well behaved and well cared for. \u00a0100 dirham. \u00a0Lunch in the Berber village was wonderful and authentic. \u00a0As it is Ramadan and \u00a0AdiI and his partner were fasting, I ate with a couple from Chicago, and we had a very pleasant lunch, sharing our travel experiences. \u00a0It is VERY authentic so expect a fly and a small cat or two, but also expect a good tangine and even better couscous. \u00a0You will not leave hungry. \u00a0Another piece of advice, if you are looking for rugs, I highly advise the shop were he will take you in the mountains, if you want to go. \u00a0\u00a0I got no pressure whatsoever. \u00a0In fact, because I bought in the Medina the day before, I had him bypass the carpet shop, which was no problem, but I asked him to turn back. \u00a0\u00a0I bought two more as the prices were so reasonable. \u00a0The shop is as nice and as big as any in Marrakech, very low pressure, and they ship. The prices were significantly less for comprobable quality and a much better view than the Medina. Watching the ladies make Argan oil was special as well. I advise that. It seems to be a true cooperative, so it benefits the local women. \u00a0\u00a0It was obvious that Adil has a special spirit wants to truly wants improve life in the villages. He is passionate about it. \u00a0One of the neatest parts of the day is that there is a little boy in one of the villages with diabetes. \u00a0Adil had purchased syringes for the boy to take his insulin. \u00a0When we drove into the boy's village, the other kids went to find him (after getting their piece of candy). He ran to the car, thanked Adil profusely and we were off again. Lastly, the beauty of the mountains is difficult to describe, and pictures barely do it justice. Though some of the roads were narrow and rocky, I always felt very safe. The views were worth it. Also, remember that this is not a 4 hour excursion to the very touristy Ourika Valley. \u00a0I priced those as well. \u00a0There are many guides who will do that. \u00a0My Medina guide wanted to take me; however, Adil's tour is unique. We drove through the valley, but it was not the primary tour, though I believe that Adil will take you wherever you want to go. Everyone there asked for money and wanted to sell us something. \u00a0The real beauty of this trip lies much higher in the Atlas Mountains where few people go. \u00a0For me it was a good way to spend 1 day. \u00a0In short: Easy to organize. No hassles. \u00a0Pure beauty. Purer intentions. \u00a0I hope to take my children with me on the tour one day. \u00a0\u00a0A don't miss.Sent from my iPhone"

Adil is great with the kids in the mountain. we brought some sweets for them. they were so grateful.i wish i brought more stuff to give to the children. the trip was an insight into the berber culture and to see the poverty up in the mountain.we stopped and had lunch in Berber house. the tangine and couscous were the best i ever had. the best meal in Morocco. We actually gave extra money for the meal, as it was helping the community.the tour with Adil was not commercial. he is working and also helping the people in the mountains. He has excellent knowledge of the roads and place. we felt very safe in the back of his 4x4 esp on the treacherous off road routes he took.if we go back to Marrakesh, we will definitely contact him again fr another trip. we also recommend him to anyone who is planning a trip to Marrakesh"

My girlfriend and I booked a tour of the Atlas Mountains with Adil for early June, and we couldn't have been happier with the trip. We were picked up and went for a gorgeous drive up through the scenic mountains, stopping at the Argan Oil Coop and spending some time with a the women who press it by hand. If you go, buy tons, since the product is great (far cheaper than in the US) and goes to help the women who craft it. We also traveled up through the villages, and up to the local school, where we had the opportunity to give lots of pens, markers and other writing supplies to the local kids. What a wonderful, sweet group up there. If you go, make sure to bring some small things to share. The kids really appreciate it. With how much good he does for the community, Adil is clearly a local hero.We also had dinner with one of the local families, where we had easily the best tagine in Morocco (even better than the fancier restaurants). Since we just so happened to be taking this tour on my birthday, apparently Adil let the family know ahead of time, and they made me a special cake. It was really, really touching. Easily out of everything we did during our two weeks in Morocco, this was our favorite part. Adil's passion and deep care for the people of the Atlas villages comes through, and is something that we will have with us as a wonderful memory for life.If you're thinking about going to the Marrakesh area, don't hesitate to go on this tour.Thank you again!Martin & Lisa"

            "review": "A personal itinery and local knowledge from a gracious guide. We recommend Adil.. My wife and I spent our honeymoon in Morocco, staying in Marrakesh (Oct 2011). We were looking at tripadvisor came across a review of 4 x 4 camel. So we emailed Adil to explain we were coming on honeymoon and would like to arrange something special.Adil gave us some available dates, we communitcated by email and eventually agreed a day and all charges in advance. As agreed he met us on the day at our hotel once we had arrived.Adil is a gracious and very knowledgeable guide and able to make suggestions and give options on places that we might like to visit. He was flexible about the day and had suggested in advance that we might prefer to come with him on Berber market day and meet local people rather than the tourists market.We had an amazing tour of the Atlas Mountains, meeting local Berber people, loved the Berber market - Adil had also organised lunch with a Berber family from a mountain hamlet - this was an agreed extra cost and was very reasonably priced. Adil advised that we bring some sweets or colouring pencils for the many children that we would meet travelling through villages and hamlets. Indeed the children were quite lovely, intrigued by new visitors and grateful for such small gifts. We brought some wrapped boiled sweets and few other bits but clearly needed and extra bag or two. We were grateful that Adil had also brought some gifts for the children too as we soon ran out. We were really blessed by our day with Adil and having a chance to meet and greet some lovely local people, families and children. The culture is very different but some of the values and customs were quite precious. We are grateful to Adil for his friendship and kindness, in showing us such interesting people and places and making our honeymoon a memorable one."

We started by being picked up and going for a scenic drive through villages. We had a camel ride with fiesty camels. We then went to a collective where Argan oil is made. We loved the demonstrations and really finding out how Argan oil is made. We loved being able to shop but also know that the money would go toward a good cause. Adil took care of us and even spotted us a few dollars when we were short. The most amazing part of the trip was going up to the Berber village. We had brought many school supplies with us and it warmed our hearts to be able to give it away. It was so amazing that the chldren were so grateful and so interested in us. We wished that we had brought some clothes as well. We ate at the Berber house and it was incredible. It was very clean and very authentic and we were blessed to meet our hosts who were wonderful. The most wonderful part of the trip is Adil. He is so enthusiastic about what we can do to help the Berber people. We plan to go back and bring our significant others. It was an incredible experience and we will do it again."

            "review": "Amazing Insight into the Berber Culture, highlight of our trip!. The trip with Adil to the Atlas mountains was definitely the highlight of our trip to Marrakech. Every new place we go we try to book a tour of the surrounding area, this one in particular was considerably better than anyone we've been on prior. Most tours put you on a bus that has a pretty rigid schedule. This is not one of those. Adil gives you the flexibility to see whatever you may want to visit. If you don't have any ideas about what you want to see he'll suggest some sights, which won't disappoint! Multiple times on the trip we asked Adil to pul over so we could snap some quick photos of the beautiful scenery you'll encounter. Our trip included Camel Rides, a Berber Market Place, the Ourika Valley for some tea, a woman's Argan Oil Co-Op, some off roading in the land cruiser (hence the name Camel 4x4) and lunch at a Berber House. The camel rides were a lot of fun but a little scary at times. The Berber Market was a complete assault of your senses. I don't believe I'll ever forget that place, loved the experience! Tea in the Ourika Valley was serene. Here we talked with Adil about Moroccan and Berber culture as well as our own. I find it truly fascinating learning about other cultures way of life. The woman's Argan Oil Co-Op was interesting as well. They educate you on how the oil is made and let you sample some of the different products made from Argan Oil. At no point are you pressured to buy anything, which is a refreshing change from the Souks of the Medina. Next Adil takes you where no tour bus has been before! You start heading up the side of a mountain on a gravel \"road\". I use road in a loose sense because some parts where rather bumpy, which added to the experience. Here you can get some great scenery shots of the valley and the mountains. At this point in the trip is when you start to come across some Berber Children. After reading some other reviews about this trip we knew to bring some school supplies and sweets for the children, which Adil also mentioned. You can tell Adil really cares about the people living out this way, who would otherwise not feel the impact of Morocco's #1 industry - tourism. We were more than happy to pick up some colored pencils, coloring books, notebooks, and candy before we left for Morocco. Adil would slow down as we came up to groups of kids to hand out our presents. The excitement on their face over 1 piece of candy and a pencil is something worth seeing. Adil makes sure everyone gets an equal share and that they don't get too much. They recently found out two of the children in the village are diabetic so Adil make sure they don't receive any candy and instead get something more than a pencil - a coloring book and some colored pencils in this case! If anyone reads this review before going please bring some school supplies and sweets for the children. Up next was lunch at a Berber House. This was a really cool experience. The family cooked you lunch and you got to see how they lived. The food was the best we had while in Morocco and the view from their terrace was spectacular. The money for lunch is paid directly to the family and with that money they have been able to upgrade their home and purchase a fridge. Just another example of Adil trying his best to make sure tourism benefits people outside the major cities. It's worth noting that before the trip we were hesitant to do this instead of the restaurant option. I couldn't be happier that we picked this instead of the restaurant. If you're on the fence here just do the Berber House, you won't regret it. The ride home featured more stunning scenery and was very relaxing. When we make another trip to Marrakech we definitely plan on doing the dessert tour with Adil. Thanks again Adil! -Brandon and Rachel"

            "review": "Excellent!. We booked 4x4 on the basis of reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed, the tour is everything you would want because Adil will tailor make the day to suit your needs. I will attempt to use this review to fill in some gaps that I have not seen on previous reviews. The tour is very good value for money, the stops at the Berber market and camel ride are all optional so tell Adil what you would like from your day and he will be happy to accommodate you. The meal with the family was the best we tasted while in Marrakech and very good value, the income these meals bring in has made a big impact on the family household and you are made to feel so welcome. Take Dirham to pay for the meal, camel ride etc as, although you will be quoted in Euros it is difficult for the locals to change them, you will also meet some local sellers at the market who have some lovely goods, but again you will need Dirham to pay.The local children really appreciate what you take them as anything over the basics is a luxury. I took sweets that could be shared and T-shirts from age 4 years to 12 years. Pencils and crayons are good for their school work, also the children walk a great deal so there are water taps everywhere and I thought some water bottles would have been light to pack, pretty hair scrunchies for the girls.I wouldn't hesitate to book again and would be happy to answer any questions."

We stopped at a Berber market, Argan oil coorporative, Berber village, had lunch at a Berber home, trip through the valleys, a mountain village and lastly a camel ride in the valley that looked like the dessert. We were advised to bring sweets for the Berber children and they were so excited to see Adil and receive the sweets. Adil tailored the trip to accomodate our toddler son. He gave us great insight on the areas we visited, very accomodating (stopped for us to take photos, late check out at our hotel between valleys) and very friendly (our son took to him). The cool air was a welcome, a good break from Marrakesh, it was nice to witness the everyday life of the locals, see beautiful Morroccain landscape and meet the people. We highly recommend it. Thank you Adil for a memorable trip."

Adil also explained how the money paid for meals has helped to develop the family home and it felt nice to be making a contribution. Adil is clearly held in very high regard by the local people and does A LOT to help the local people which was clear in the way they responded to him (especially the kids - amazing to see!).Overall a clear highlight of our holiday and we would highly recommend Adil as a tour guide - by offering private tours he is able to shape the trip to meet your wishes and truly make it a wonderful experience.

This is particularly important as this is a private tour with just you and Adil, so is important.First stop is a tour around the Berbere Market, which is an incredible awakening for the senses, the Market is frantic, scary at times, but Adil ensured we were comfortable at all times, and we got to see a slice if every day Berbere life. A camel ride, and a trip to an Argan oil co operative followed which were both fantastic. However, the highlight by far was lunch in a home of one of the local people within. A Berbere valley at the top of the mountains, great food, and stories from Adil about Berbere culture and lifestyle.We forgot to take pens, sweets, any old clothes, as there are loads of opportunities to give these away to local children which is great.All in all, an extremely authentic insight in Berbere life, amazing views of the atlas mountains, great food, camel ride and Argan oil plant visitA truly great day, and a \"must do\" on any tip to Marrakech."

Adil is an interesting and informative guide, with a real love for his country and the Berber people and this came across throughout the day.The market was ... an experience, don't expect too many stalls selling your usual UK market stuff etc. This a market for local people and if you can fit it in, definitely do it.Rather than do a huge review of everything we did, all I'd do is agree with everything that people have posted about Adil and 4x4 Camel. If you want a personal experience of Morrocco rather than jumping on your hotel's excursion bus with someone whos is there for the summer season, then I can't recommend Adil highly enough and me and my wife will have happy memories (and photos) for years."

He picked us up at our hotel and we drove towards the Atlast mountains. En route we stopped at a Berber market, where Adil showed us around. The sardine bread snack which Adil recommended was very good. The market was interesting, full of things one would not expect to see. I got acquainted with one of the friendly sheep there. Afterwards, we went on a camel ride (my fav bit) before touring the Argan Oil cooperative in the Ourika valley. The valley was very pretty although it was dry season so not as much water around as it usually perhaps would. The scenery was stunning from high up inthe mountains. Afterwards we went along the road to a Berber village where we bumped into some very sweet kids and also dropped by a school. Its a good idea to bring along stationery and sweets for the kids (cos they love it/ ??slightly expected??) Lunch at the Berber family house was very pleasant and their views from the rooftop was impressive. After lunch, we toured the Asni valley- we spotted Richard Branson's luxury hotel acrossthe valley!! After some more amazing photo stops, including the snow capped peaks of the mountains at 4000m!! we headed backto Marrakesh. A trip well worth and Adil was an excellent guide to our journey. Expect about 120 euros for the trip for two. the camel ride costs around 200 dirhams for two and the meal 200 dirhams. Argan oil cooperative products expect prices on par with the the UK high street. Hope you enjoy your journey!! PS Adil only does private tours and he cater to individual tour needs so if you have any requests- please discuss early with him. (eg touring waterfalls etc)"

After the market, we had a 30mins camel ride in the valley which was superb, followed by a visit to the oil cooperative. We then headed up the mountains to see some amazing views which climaxed with our lunch with the Berber family....amazing!

Great value and Adil is passionate about the social aspects of bringing people to the mountains and likes to ensure that isolated villages have a fair share of the tourism which i think is admirable. You do see some sad situations e.g a young boy who had lost his sight recently following a fall but Adil really seems to care about the welfare and impact of his business on the traditional way of life and is very respectful of this. Although Adil asks that you take jumpers and pencils the children wanted sweets and footballs! i would take these if i went again. I know some websites say this is not advisable but in reality they dont get sweets every day and Adil does ensure that they are given sparingly. My advice would be to take some clothes for young children i.e. under 12 years old and also some sweets and toys if you can find room in your cases. Just be careful at the oil cooperative as they wrapped my item in sticky tape and when i got home it wasnt the item i had wanted but this could have genuinely been my mistake."

We also chose not to have lunch in the berber village but to stop at a restaurant at Lake Lac instead. However, Adil thought we might like to visit the berber market and he was right, our friend survived a genuine berber lather and shave and we all had the best fresh bbq'd sardine burger we've ever had.

We also benefitted from seeing the good he does by bringing tourists into berber homes as the tourist dollars spent here go a long way. It was obvious that the small gratuity we were leaving meant a lot to the comfort of these villagers, I'm not talking a flat screened TV here, I'm talking about a newly bought fridge and a concreted roof!In addition, Adil opened a large pack of small crayons which he passed to groups of young children along the way. He is something of a pied piper to these kids, they were so excited to receive one small crayon, I'm afraid my children would be exactly the opposite. We all were humbled by this and were happy to witness such selflessness.Adil stopped at some particularly scenic spots where we took photos; it's beautiful up there.Upon returning to Marrakech Adil helped me find some good quality tea glasses. Overall, Adil was the perfect guide.NB If you plan on booking a trip with Adil and you have some space in your suitcase the berber kiddies will take anything useful you can give, especially old children's clothes or art and craft supplies, please consider it."

I am another pleased customer and would 100% recommend Adil and his tours to others. We chose Adil and his 1 day Atlas mountains tour based on the recommendations on here and we weren't disappointed. The tour was one of the highlights of our holiday to Marrakech. The meal in the Berber house was something we will never forget - the experience was unique, authentic and so delicious (one of our nicest meals on the holiday).It was evident that Adil cares about the Berber children, the local people and their community and giving something back to the community.He has excellent English and explained so much about Morocco and it's culture, allowed us to fill in the gaps for lots of questions we had about what we had seen so far in our holiday.For around \u00a350 each (for a group of 3), it was fantastic value. Book now and you won't be disappointed."

We chose Adil to take us on a excursion to the Atlas Mountains and we were incredibly happy we chose him.As a private tour guide Adil comes highly recommended. He is personable, speaks great English and has a great sense of humour!We felt really comfortable in his company and were impressed with his knowledge and stories- he kept us entertained and engaged all day.We also appreciated Adil's ability to give us space as a group to explore things by ourselves- whilst always making sure that we knew where we were going and felt ok with the plans. We feel we definately benefitted from having a local show us around as he was able to show us local customs and steer us away from tourist traps.On our day with him we visited a Berber market, continued onto lalla takerkoust and Asni valley then onto an absolutely incredible lunch with a Berber family. Wow!After filling our bellies with the most delicious meal we had in all our time in Marrakech, we continued on to Ourika Valley and the Argan Oil Co-operative.This trip was definately one of the highlights of our trip and we would not hesitate to recommend Adil as a fantastic guide for anybody wishing to have a really excellent tour in all respects. Worth every dirham!! :)"

After several days in the hustle and bustle of the city it was so relaxing to escape to the Atlas, take in the scenery, enjoy the food and meet the people. Adil picked us up in his immaculate 4x4 (such a change from Marrakech taxis!) at 9:15 and in approx 1hr we were in the mountains learning about the production and use if Argan oil. We then had a delicious tea by the river and continued up the mountains stopping for various photos and giving sweets to excited children. We bought 100 lollies and only 1 was left at the end!We then stopped to have a lunch in a Berber home. We had a delicious tomato salad, chicken and vegetable tagines, bread and cous cous. The food Habiba made was delicious and I was so grateful that it was no problem to make a vegetarian option. We had lunch on the terrace in the sun and then had the sweetest oranges I have ever tasted! We then said bye to the kids and headed back down, with Adil stopping to give a young boy clothes along the way and passing various overloaded trucks on their way back from the Market!This was a thoroughly enjoyable trip which I would recommend to anyone who has a few days in Marrakech. Adil was a great guide, with an excellent knowledge of Marrakech & the Atlas. The donations he brings for the Berber families are also great - I recommend bringing clothes, stationary & toys for the kids - we only brought sweets and regretted it! They are so appreciative of anything you give them."

After several disappointing days in Marrakesh, my partner & I were wishing we had chosen a different holiday location. Luckily we came across the previous reviews and decided to book a half day tour with Adil. This was definitely the best decision we had made since arriving in Marrakesh and our trip to the Ourika Valley was the highlight of our holiday. Adil is a charming, friendly and intuitive guide with an excellent knowledge of the area, the Berbers and all things Moroccan. He provided a highly personalised service that was tailor made to suit us. I could write pages but will resist the urge to describe every detail about our time with him. All I will say is that if you do decide to book Adil you will not be disappointed. He is a lovely man who will show you the real sights and sounds of Morocco. I know that I will return to Marrakesh and will book a 2 day tour with him next time. Shukran Adil!"

I completely agree with everything from the promptness of his responses to the specifically catered day trip. When booking my trip, Adil recommended that we schedule it for Monday. I learned upon his arrival at our riad that he recommended this day specifically because we'd be able to walk through a Berber market which only happens weekly. That was so thoughtful to me. He knew that we were really interested in seeing how the people live and work, and that's exactly what he showed us. Additionally, we told him that we wanted to purchase Argan oil (don't leave Morocco without it), tagines, and silver. Not only did he take us to places where we could purchase these items, but he took us to the best place he knew of with the most authentic materials. The place where we purchased the Argan oil was a co-operative which supports women who are either divorced or widowed by providing them jobs making the oil by hand. It was amazing. If you get to go here, make sure you try the argan honey and the argan butter...YUM!The last part of our trip was to the Berber house for lunch. The journey there took us through amazing mountains views, and we stopped a few times along the way to take pictures. These were the most beautiful sights we saw in Morocco. There were grassy hills with the Atlas Mountains in the background. Absolutely stunning. Once we arrived in the Berber village where our meal was being prepared, we began to see the children. Adil's connection with these children is amazing. They were SO excited to see him. One little boy, no more than 4-years-old, practically jumped in the car with excitement. I was so happy that we brought candy and pencils for them. They loved it. The meal at the Berber house was the highlight of our entire trip. It was \"fantabulous\"! LOL! The best meal we had in Morocco...and that's not to say that our other meals weren't great. This homemade meal was just above and beyond. Chicken tagine, cous cous, everything.Bottom-line, book with Adil. You won't regret it. :) We met as strangers in a business arrangement, and we parted as friends. I will cherish this trip forever."

After the hectic life of Marrakech my boyfriend and I hired Adil for the day to take us into the Atlas Mountains, hoping for a change of scenery! Adil offers a range of options of tours, so the flexibility to choose what you want to do is very liberating. From the moment he arrived Adil was incredibly professional. He picked us up from our hotel in a clean and safe 4x4 and drove us into the Mountains. He's extremely knowledgable about Berber culture and Moroccan life in general and was happy to talk while driving us around. We visited a berber market (where we were not pressued to buy anything). It was a great taste of traditional berber life and was full of amazing smells, sights and tastes! We visited the Argan Oil Cooperative, run entirely by women, and again, no pressure to buy the product. This was enlightening and empowering. Heading deeper into the mountains, we visited some Berber villages and stopped to have lunch in the home of a lovely family. They were very welcoming, and the views were spectacular over the valley. The food was delicious (typical Moroccan) and meeting the family gave us a chance to ask Adil about the way of life of people who live in the Atlas mountain region. We had looked at reviews before we arrived and had brought sweets and pencils for the children of the village. They really appreciated the gesture and was great to see them interact together. Just a tip for anyone thinking of going!The whole day was very well organised, professional and very interesting. Getting out into the tranquil mountains was a welcome break from the craziness of Marrakech. Adil's tour of the Atlas mountains was culturally sensitive and he has a deep connection with the people who live in the region. If you want a real taste of Moroccan life, don't look elsewhere, Adil's tailor made trips are perfect!"

Besides making his living with his business, he has respect for the Berber families and children and cares for them in an honest way.

We stayed the night in the desert and drove back the next day.Adil looked after us splendidly. The drive took 7 hours from door to camel. Adil picked us up in the Djema early in the morning and began the drive over the mountains. The scenery throughout the drive was incredible! The roads were pretty well looked after but Adil was such a great driver that when there were road blocks or problems we were never worried. While in the mountains we stopped to buy argan oil from a small specialised shop. We often stopped to take pictures which was never a problem because there was very little traffic. The camel trek was enjoyable and took approximately 2 hours, including a stop for the sunset. The camp we arrived at was nice, with beds and fully functioning bathrooms and showers. The camp was very quiet, and we were there with only one other couple. The only problem was the fact that it was so cold at night, but that was easily solved by drinking tea and bundling up. The next day we started early, afraid that the pass through the mountains would close due to snow, but on the way we stopped at a ksar unesco heritage site. The buildings were incredible and Adil was a great tour guide.Adil was very accommodating, easy to talk to and knew a lot about morocco. We had a wonderful trip and highly recommend it!"

We actually negotiated a slightly longer trip a little further into the desert, and I'm so glad we did.Adil collected us promptly from our respective hotels in his smart and well equipped 4x4. Right from the start he was helpful and friendly and we quickly realised that we were in good hands.Our trip took us across the snow-capped Atlas mountains, through some stunning scenery, stopping off a a few well-chosen spots for some very nice refreshments along the way (Adil clearly knows the places well, and always picked very nice places for us).Toward the end of the first day we were in the edges of the Sahara and it was time to leave our 4x4 for the last stage of our journey as we made our way towards camp on camel through the desert as the sun set gently - it was a magical experience. The camp with tents and real beds in the desert was lovely. A good mix of other visitors, and we all sang long into the night round the fire.Up early for the most gorgeous and peaceful sunrise, then off out of the desert and back toward Marrakech in Adil's 4x4 (REALLY needed to get around there!), stopping at more interesting locations including a spot used for filming many big films including Gladiator, James Bond and much more.Adil was an excellent guide and host the whole way through, always picking great locations for views, exploring or eating. Nothing was ever too much trouble for him, and he did so much to make our trip very enjoyable.I would definitely employ his services again if I am ever back in Marrakech and want to explore!"

We want to thank Adil for giving us such a fantastic day in the Atlas mountains, an experience we would not have had without his knowledge and guidance. Our day was similar to previous reviews: picked up in Adil's 4x4 and taken to the first stop, a bustling market at the foot of the Atlas mountains, then a camel ride, a visit to mountain herbs and an argan oil women's cooperative before heading on to a family run restaurant for a very enjoyable lunch by the riverside. The fun then began when we made our way over the mountain track with spectacular views and very narrow routes which seemed to last forever! With several photo stops en route we stopped at a mountain village to meet the children and gave football tops to the boys, necklaces to the girls and sweets to all. They had so little and were extremely happy with their gifts, we only wish we had taken more to give. Tea at the Berber household was lovely and we were made to feel very welcome drinking a eating on their roof top terrace. We returned back to Marrakesh after a full but extremely enjoyable day that we will not forget. Thank you to Adil and the people he introduced us to along the way!"

He speaks great English, French, Arabic and even some Berber. He was knowledgable and able to answer questions regarding Moroccan culture. We drove for about an hour up to the foothills of the atlas mountains. We stopped at a Berber market. What an experience! We then kept driving into the mountains and stopped at a female cooperative for argan oil to see how this difficult fruit is cultivated. Then for the fun of off roading up the mountain with spectacular views around every turn. We finally came to the Berber village where we were to have lunch in a Berber family home. We had read the previous reviews which recommended bringing sweets/ candies for the children of the village. They were waiting for us when we exited the car and surrounded us. They were so excited. They seem to look forward to Adil bringing his guests here. He has also bought them boots in the past. We thought perhaps had we known we would have tried to bring other items as well. The lunch was wonderful. We were sitting on a terrace with a view of the village and mountains. We had chicken tangine and couscous and of course fresh mint tea. Then it was time to head back to the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. All in all it was a beautiful experience and would recommend it to anyone wanting a different vantage point of morocco."

Along with the most amazing lunch by the river, food all recommended by Adil and was absolutely delicious!

At this time of the year there is snow on the High Atlas Mountains, which made the views even more breathtaking. Once across the mountains, the scenery is amazing. Every bend brings another fantastic view.We travelled down to the desert, and enjoyed the last 90 minutes of the journey on a real camel, led by the most caring and charming young man from the Berber campsite we were heading to. We had the extra pleasure of watching the new crescent moon and Venus light the sky as darkness fell. There is nothing like the sight of the star-filled desert sky once night falls. Sitting by the fire, after our delicious meal, we saw shooting stars too. The Berber community who ran the campsite were charming and we had a lot of fun making music around the campfire. The tents surpassed our expectations with real beds! it was a cold, cold night, but we had all anticipated that, so had enough clothing to stay warm. Thermals, scarves and gloves are a big help!Getting up at 6.00 am to see the sunrise was a real treat. Only a few of us did so, but the pure magic of standing a top a high sand dune, in the silence of the desert, as the sun rose and turned those dunes an incredible shade of pink is not to be missed.Breakfast was simple, but excellent, and the coffee and tea piping hot. We left the campsite, and headed off across the desert towards the road. Yes, it was exciting! We all loved it.On the way back we stopped at the fabulous Kasbah used in several films, including the Gladiators. A real WOW experience.Adil is a great guide. He speaks excellent English and is a very skilful driver. You are in safe hands with his really nice guy.

Adil responded quickly to emails and made some suggestions, with no pressure and flexibility to decide on the day. He met us right on time at the riad and set off towards the Ourika Valley and the mountains, with the option of a camel ride on the way - great fun with well tempered camels and friendly guides. After a fascinating visit to a women's oil making co-operative, we went off-road through the hills, joining a minor road past Berber villages, where Adil arranged for us to walk alone for an hour, meeting Berber children on the way. Adil suggested bringing some sweets to offer as a greeting (one only per child) and this felt appropriate. The highlight was lunch with a charming Berber family - the most delicious tagine and couscous on a terrace looking out to the mountains, the silence broken only by a cock crowing. Later we wound our way down to another valley, past Berbers returning from market with laden donkeys or balancing precariously on shared minivans. Adil's vehicle was comfortable and well-maintained and his driving always felt safe. He is very knowledgeable about the local people and clearly a trusted friend to local families and children, giving impromptu map-reading lessons with tourist maps of the area and stopping once to sort out what was bothering a crying child. On the main road down the mountain, we encountered a queue of cars watching helplessly while a car belched smoke on the verge of combusting. Adil leaped out apologetically, grabbed his fire extinguisher, and ran to the rescue to douse the flames - apparently not the first time this has happened. Adil's English is very good and he responded to our interests and questions rather than in any way having a prepared script. Knowing we had just two days in Morocco, he managed to pack in a lot of experiences while leaving us feeling entirely refreshed at the end of the day. His price and those of the activities were very reasonable and clear ahead. 4 x 4 Camel is a one-person business and if you book Adil, you will get him. We would definitely recomment this exceptional man for day or longer trips and would trust him to construct a memorable itinerary for any traveller to Morocco."

During this trip we saw such different aspects of Morocco one could never explore without a knowing guide. Adil was just that and much more. He takes you outside of the touristic tracks, to truly authentic Berber villages where the people's only concern is to make your stay and trip as enjoyable as possible. He speaks English very well, so language is not an issue. What is also nice about Adil's company is that he does not (normally) make group tours, so you only travel and share the experience with people you know and choose to go with.We started off our trip in Marrakech, and drove towards Southern parts of Morocco, making occasional stops in places with beautiful views or culturally remarkable sights (D'Argan Oil producing village, old kasbahs). The first night we spent in a beautiful Rose Valley, in the most charming hotel I've ever been to. It was a very small hotel with only a few visitors in addition to our group with clean and cozy rooms. The food was absolutely delicious, and after dinner the hotel personnel entertained us with their traditional music instruments and toothpick riddles. It is hard to believe how fast a few hours can pass by even without TV or Wifi connection. It almost felt like a home stay rather than a hotel visit, and we were sad to leave the next morning.But our schedule required us to move on, and the next day we drove to the desert of Sahara, which was just amazing. We rode camels and did sand boarding, renting a quad would also have been possible. After having fun in the sand and watching the beautiful sunset, we took off on our camels again and rode to our camping site, as we had decided to do camping that night (hotel stay during the whole trip is also possible). Similar to the night before, the camping area was extremely nice with fire inside the tent and 4 blankets to keep us warm (though it should be mentioned that specially at this time of the year, December, it still gets super cold so be prepared!). Again we had amazing dinner accompanied with music and games by the bonfire, under the sky full of stars. The next morning we woke up early to see the sunrise, had delicious breakfast (again! Food on this trip is amazing! And everything but lunch is included in the price), and get to the car to head back to Marrakech. Even on this long trip we stopped a couple of times, and the drive never gets boring with the beautiful scenery of the Atlas mountains and soothing music in the background.All in all I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this trip, it was the most exciting and amazing travel experience I've had. Adil knows what he's doing, taking you to places you'd never find alone. Also, he's incredibly flexible, so the trip can be made very customized according to what you want. He, among other things, accommodated one of our vegetarian friends with fresh and great food, and made a sand board available in the desert upon request.I HIGHLY recommend Adil's tour if you want to do something completely different with a reliable, friendly and extremely committed guide, who allows you to see the authentic lifestyle of the Berbers. Enjoy a few days without worrying about the time or e-mails. An ultimately eye-opening and relaxing, yet exciting experience.For further information, Adil's e-mail address is mfadil3@yahoo.com. He replies very fast!"

Having read positive reviews for Adil's company on tripadvisor, we were pretty confident with the booking and our expectations were high. Adil exceeded our expectations in every possible way. He picked us up from our hostel, and made the entire experience a very enjoyable one. His english is fantastic and this was helpful as none of our group members knew Arabic. His native experience was essential in getting a great cultural immersion during our three day tour into the Sahara. He maintained great professionalism throughout our trip, and did his best to accomodate our wishes. We were all sad to leave Adil at the end of our journey. Last of all, his prices were very fair and we appreciated his kindness the most. Thank you Adil, hope to see you again in the future next time we visit. Best,Parth"

Adil picked us up from the Riad, he is a friendly guy with a smiley face, a true gentleman. we wanted to go to A\u00eft Benhaddou, which is a 4 hour drive from Marrakesh, so he suggested we have breakfast on the way. he was a great guide, patient throughout and really pleasant. he knows English very well, his car is very clean and he told us to tell him if we wanted to stop anywhere to take pictures. we felt like we were all friends, and not a group with a guide, he was one of us, which made the trip even more enjoyable. I would definitely recommend him to everyone, because truly, he has made the trip magical and memorable. thank you Adil."

After that we drove through some of the remote villages where he dropped off some shoes for children. Apparently a friend had sent them to him to take to the children. I wish I had of known about this as I would have loved to contribute, but Adil was not at all pressuring about this as it seemed to be something he did from the heart. He also did not pressure us to eat at the Berber family home versus the restaurant, but allowed us the choice. Once we chose the family home, he related that he felt it was a good experience for folks to have and it helped out the family, but, again, he didn't say this before we made our choice. The camel ride was nice and with a neat view, but the highlights for me were the mountains and the time in the Berber home with the delicious meal!!"

We were in Marrakech for a short break and I can honestly say that the trip with him has created the warmest of memories and was the highlight of the trip.Booking the trip via email was very easy and Adil made sure all of my numerous queries were answered in full. The day of the trip I wasn't feeling my best (having indulged in too much wine at the previous nights dinner!) When Adil learned of this he made sure that I felt comfortable and asked if everything was ok, at the medicinal herb village he mentioned 'my condition!' to one of the staff and they made me a mint tea with an additional herb that is meant to help soothe tender heads and fragile tummys! (possibly thyme but i can't remember !)Having dinner in the Berber village high in the mountains was a wonderful experience, the tagine & meal we ate was the best one I tasted during my time in Marrakech and we ate at some of the more expensive popular restaurants.We brought stationary items and sweets for the children and Adil knew them all by name and clearly cared about their welfare.i would whole heartedly advise booking Adil to be your guide and when (not if!) i go back to marrakech i would book him again."

He then drove us to a local Market where we started with the local dentist, barber, doctor then we went through the meat section which was an eye opener. We ended up in the clothing area where we bought some clothes for the local children in the village we were visiting. Next stop was a restaurant by the river for lunch. The restaurant was lovely and good setting. Next we travelled to the Aryan oil co-operative which was a little expensive then made our way up through the mountains to a village Adil visits. All the children came out to see us and as we had brought some sweets, balloons, pens and pencils for them we also gave them clothes which we had bought at the local Market. The children loved the sweets and balloons then we stopped at local house for tea. It was certainly good to go into the mountains and see how they how they live away from the towns and certainly made our kids appreciate things in life. Adil picked us up at 9am and we were back at our hotel for 5pm. Good worthwhile trip and good to do if visiting morocco."

            "review": "The best part of the trip and a wonderful man!. After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor I spoke with Adil by email to book him for October - I think i first spoke to him in July to arrange it. He was always very quick to reply and helpful, even recommending Riads to stay in after our trip.Just before we got to Morocco I received an email to ask whether we would be happy sharing the trip with anouther similar aged couple - this was entirely our decision but we accpeted the company and they were lovely too.Adil picked us up from the airport and immediately whisked us up into the Altas mountains - we stopped for photos at hand picked locations and Adil told us about the area. We stopped at an Argan oil cooperative and sampled their argan oil with honey and almond paste - strangely delightful. We travelled on to a quiet and remote Kasbah in the mountians which was beautiful and very cheap to look around. Here we also stopped for the best lunch of the whole holiday! We had a beef, prune, fig and fresh walnut tagine - but you have whatever they got in the morning. it was delicious with all the cinamon and boiled eggs on top... mmmmmWe travelled on and the scenery changed at we came to the Rose Valley - there we staooped for the night at an incredible place - I won't say too much as i wouldn't want to ruin the suprise for you. But my advise: bring a song - something happy and easy - our minds went blank!In the morning we got in the car again and travelled down to Tatna Gorge, we got there before the tourists - it was beautiful. Jumping in the car again we stopped for lunch and then drove off into the desert. After some time we arrived at the dunes, it had recently rained and so there was a lake - it was very picturesque, like you'd see in the films.We rode some camels into the dunes (and then walked the last bit) to watch the sun set, it was so calm and beautiful, and gets chilly pretty quickly once the sun has gone down. We rode the camels back to camp - this takes a while - Take a jumper to sit on! the saddles are not comfortable like horses' saddles! We were very lucky that there was a full moon and so even in the middle of the night the whole place was a magical silver colour. We had another fiendly evening with like minded travellers - and got up at 6 to watch the sun rise in the morning. Children come to sell you things - they are vey polite and patient and don't bother you - that is my one regret, not buying something from them!From here we had a mamoth journey back to Marrakech but it was still broken up with a trip to a real berber market - it was date season too so it was heaving. A picnic in a village oasis and a visit to an epicier!We arrived in Marrakech in the dark - and this is where the drama happened! I realised at this point that I had lost my wallet with 700Euro in it!! Adil took us into our Riad and we searched our bags for the money - no where to be seen. We took the car apart too but nothing. Adil told us to be calm and even called a friend in England to cancel all my cards!!! He wouldn't take any money and told us that we would find a way to settle this once we were home. He was a star. Here's where it gets weird, Adil found the wallet - with the money in it! He called me (i was back in the UK) and told me that he would be in the UK to hand it back to me - he took the money i owed him and even payed the Riad that I owed too and then we met in London at a Christmas Fair (that i had already booked!!) and he gave me back my wallet!! Spooky huh!?! Adil certainly went the extra mile and I cannot recommend the trip enough - Go you will love it."

I wanted a short camel ride, so Adil stopped off for me to do this on our way to the Atlas mountains. During our day, we visited a local Berber market, a womens Argan oil co-operative, a Berber house for tea (fantastic!) and a walk up the waterfalls. We took pencils, sweets and hairbands for the children of the villages and these were greeted with gratful smiles and thank yous.We ate at a restaurant recommended in the village near the waterfalls and this was probably our only slight disappointment of the day. It was a fixed price of 120 dirhams each and we felt it was overpriced. In hindsight we wished we had eaten with the Berber family as was offered at the start of the day.Adil was a brilliant guide with fantastic English and a great sense of humour.It was probably the best day of our holiday, however, it did work out an expensive day when you take into account the meal, the fee for the guide to the waterfall, the camel ride and what i spent in the Argan oil shop!!I would thoroughly recommend Adil to anyone looking for a guide, he was great and delivered everything we had asked for."

            "review": "A real taste of Morocco away from the hustle and bustle of tourist groups.. I got in contact with Adil about a month or so before myself and my partner were heading to Marrakech to ask him details about his tour. Adil replied promptly to all my emails and his English was very good.On the day of our excursion with Adil we had arranged to be picked up outside our hotel at 08.30, Adil rang the hotel to tell the staff at reception he was on his way and the message was passed on to us. This reassured us quite a bit knowing that we were'nt just waiting and potentially wasting our time.When Adil turned up he was very pleasant and the 4x4 he had was roomy and clean. As we drove, Adil gave us a summary of what we would be doing throughout the course of the excursion. He was really chatty and my partner and I were really relaxed with him asking him questions about some of the strange customs and sights we had experienced in Marrakech, later we also talked about his family and where he has been on his holidays, which made it feel like we were pretty much chatting to a friend. Heading towards the atlas mountains (which look amazing even from a distance) our first stop was a huge local market. Adil explained that this market was were the locals came to buy their food and traders came to sell their wares. This was one crazy experience, a far cry from any market you will experience in the UK. We then headed on to Ourika valley where we stopped a few times for photos, Adil told us to just give him a shout if we wanted to stop at any point for photos. We also visited an Argan Oil co-operative, where we got to see how the oils are made and their many uses after trying some of the edible forms of the oils we had to buy some.After driving on further we stopped close to a village so that we could meet the local children and Adil handed out footballs to them. A short drive on we stopped in a berber village where we had lunch with a berber family. The meal was amazing, by far the best food we had in Morocco. After chatting with Adil at the table and joking that I always have a nap after such big meals, the berber family were more than happy to let us have a sleep before continuing on our trip.The rest of the trip involved driving around the picturesque asni valley, before heading back to the hotel for about 5.00pm. Basically Adil and the trip made the holiday to Marrakech and we wouldn't hesitate recommending or booking him again (he does other trips on request)."

I'd recommend anyone visiting Marrakech to give Adil a call and really experience the Atlas Mountains. Like all the reviews say here, Adil is friendly, flexible and very informative. Just tell him where you want to go and what you want to see and he'll take you there - and answer any questions along the way.First we saw a huge and pretty crazy Berber market, where Adil sorted us out some breakfast (deep fried kippers and chips...) and had a very interesting look around an argan oil women's co-operative. After that we had an unhurried and tasty lunch by the riverside before being shown around a herb garden. Then my favourite bit - he took us high up into the spectacular Atlas mountains, where we were able to stop whenever we wanted for photos - Adil even posed in a few for us!Little kids from the villages ran around the 4x4 and Adil knew all their names. We came prepared with a few toys to hand out and they were really pleased to receive them. We finished things off with some Berber tea in a villager's house, which was really peaceful.My girlfriend is vegetarian and he kept that in mind everwhere he took us to eat. We were also pretty tired from sightseeing the previous day so he took us places we wouldn't have to walk too much - like I said, very flexible and works around what you want. It cost us about \u00a3100 and the meal was about \u00a320. We spent a bit on things from the oil co-operative and left a tip for our Berber tea. But definitely worth the money.All in all, it was the best bit of our holiday."

            "review": "This could be the highlight of your entire trip!. I had read about Adil on Trip Advisor. We were travelling to Marrakech and had absolutely no intention of driving ourselves so hiring someone to drive us for a day trip into the mountains was an appealing idea. Just in case you don\u2019t make it to the end of this review [I don\u2019t do concise. After all if you are reading this you want information!] let me state here and now that we can recommend Adil and 4 x 4 Camel to you without reservation! We do have some essential recommendations however [further on] based on our experience with him.We communicated with Adil by email. No money was asked for up front and at the end of our day with him we paid him in Dirham although he accepts Euros. Adhil offered us two trips into the Atlas mountains the first would take in the Ourika valley and Setti Fatma and then backtrack and head into the next valley [Asni] on route we would have lunch in a Berber home and then visit a market. The second was a trip further afield to Ouarzazate. As the latter would involve many more hours simply travelling and we only wanted to take out one day we chose the first trip. We agreed a price of 110 Euros.All the emails we had from Adil [he is great at replying to enquiries or questions] told us that he would do/show us/organise anything we wanted. He genuinely means this. The problem comes if you have not been to Morocco and in particular the Atlas Mountains before you don\u2019t know what to do and need to rely on other peoples recommendations. So for what it is worth this is the suggestion for the itinerary and order we would choose now based on our experience of this particular trip. 1] Berber market.2] Travel into Asni valley. 3] Enjoy the stunning scenery and peace of the valley both before and after Lunch.4] Lunch in a Berber home. Time to look around and spend a little more time with the family.6] Head into the Ourika Valley which is nice but far from peaceful as it is full of tourists and day tripping Moroccans\u2019 and consequently lots and lots of traffic, cafe\u2019s, restaurants and places selling souvenirs.7] Visit the waterfalls at Setti Fatma in late afternoon you will maybe only manage one or perhaps two in the time but it was an experience climbing up the valley through all the cafes and shops perched along the way.8] Take a camel ride in the valley but ask to do it in the most attractive place possible. First of all Adil said he would be at our Riad at 9am and he kept his promise. The car was clean spacious and seemed fairly new. Adil is a good driver and is very friendly and easy to get along with. We went on a Tuesday which does affect the site of the market as they move around so the itinerary above may have to be tweaked accordingly but don\u2019t leave the market till last. We saw the market at Tahnaout but arrived in late afternoon when it was all but over. Tell Adil in detail what you want to do and the order you would like to do it!The highlight of our day and probably of the entire trip was meeting the Berber family who were so very hospitable. They were genuinely warm and friendly, gave us a memorable lunch and allowed us to share their home for a short while. Something of a humbling experience. Many people in other reviews will tell you to take things for the village children. We took apples from our garden in England [ this was day two of our trip] as a token for the family where we ate lunch [good dates or olives could be a suitable gift of this nature but Adil could advise you] and some pens and sweets and a few tubs of blowing bubbles. On reflection this was not enough and we could so easily have taken more! Do try and make room in your cases for some good cast off clothing for kids of about 3-10 years of age. If you don\u2019t have kids that age get friends to collect stuff for you. I promise you will not regret making the effort. Now we know what conditions are like this is what we will be doing in the future and we do hope to make another visit at some point. Some of the kids don\u2019t have decent footwear so if you can, this would also help! Adil himself does give gifts to the village so this is not just a case of tourist generosity. The villagers live in what we in England would consider considerable material poverty. We visited in summer and they have it tough. God knows what it is like for them in winter! They will appreciate your gifts but perhaps all the more the spirit of friendship in which they are given.  Practical stuff to be aware of:1] Lunch is extra. We paid 200dh. You will not get a fresher salad a tastier Tagine or a more authentic couscous during your stay mint tea and fresh fruit to enjoy to finish and all this in someone\u2019s home. It was special!2] Take a change of footwear to hike up Setti Fatma and see the waterfall /s. You will need proper walking shoes or strong supportive footwear to be safe. My wife managed it just in walking sandals but would not do it again. A local guide will be arranged by Adil. He only uses two local guides which he will pre-arrange another reason why telling him in advance exactly what you want is vital. Mustapha cost 100dh on top of Adil\u2019s fee. Mustapha was charming, honest and very helpful in getting us up there. My wife walks every weekend and I am a cricketer so both fit but I would not have gone up there without his guidance. He did not try to sell us anything and we were not hassled in his company. 3] If you want to do a camel ride [and why not] it will cost extra anyway so maybe save yourself the taxi fares into the Palmeraie and do it here. We did it first and in retrospect I would do it at the end of the day around sunset [more atmospheric] to cap off the day. Via Adil I negotiated from 200dh for 20 minutes for two down to 150 dh for two for 40 minutes. This was achieved mostly by not appearing very keen and telling Adil not to worry and lets drive on. The camels were clean [Adils main concern] and 40 minutes was long enough to tick it off as an experience. 4] I would personally not bother with the Argan Oil Co Operative [sorry Adil] unless you want to make time on the way out of the valley [prior to a camel ride however so be sure you have the time]. This was the second thing we did on our day. There is not a lot to it apart from a charming girl offering you an opportunity to buy some rather expensive [to my mind] soap or oil. You absolutely do not have to and it\u2019s a very soft sell but it is basically going to take time from your day that you will probably want to use elsewhere. Just my opinion.Finally before committing to Adil I did not just accept what I read on Trip Advisor at face value but asked three of the reviewers some very direct questions about their experience with him. The two who responded wrote in even more glowing terms about Adil\u2019s character and one had not only met with him prior to agreeing to hire him but had also inspected his vehicle! Adil works with a partner who we also met and they both drive matching Toyota Landcruisers. I was booking Adil from 1200 miles away on the basis of exchanging some emails so felt that this reference in particular was important. You are probably doing the same so let us add to his growing list of satisfied customers in giving him a glowing reference. We found Adil to be honest and trustworthy considerate and reliable. It\u2019s true he is a very genuine and nice guy. His colleague who we met briefly seems to be the same.Taking a trip into the mountains was something we certainly wanted to do and I did explore the alternatives to hiring Adil which are: a bus [good luck] a grand taxi (who knows what condition the car is in and you will be sharing with up to 4 other people in a car designed to carry 5 not 7 unless you hire the whole taxi yourself!) or joining a tour for the morning/ afternoon or day, which, while more comfortable than the other two, still places you in the hands of someone else\u2019s itinerary and in a vehicle with a bunch of strangers who may not share your interests and in all cases will probably only take you into the Ourika Valley. Also when we looked at comparative costs choosing Adil made sense. Adil and 4x4 Camel was the best bespoke option we could find and we would not hesitate to use Adil again during any future trip to Marrakech or Essaouira."

As we left the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh old city we chatted away getting to know each other and hearing all about the way of life in one of the most exciting places in the world. We wee asked how we wanted to spend the day and since we were limited on time we asked to stop at a shop to buy gifts for peope back home. We travelled for about half an hour and stopped at the foot of the Atlas mountains to find an Aladdins cave of treasures! We were not pressured like you would be in the souks of the city and bought some well made products made by the co-operatives in and around the area. It was not cheap but we knew what we were getting. We then moved on to an argan oil factory shop where we were shown how the oil is obtained by several women who were sat in a row shelling nuts, grinding them and extracting the oil. A time staking job which reflected on the prices of the different products on offer ie honey, soap, moisturiser etc. We then off roaded up in to the mountains. The roads were unstable and very high but felt very safe in the 4x4 and Adils driving was excellent. We arrived at the first village to be greeted by lots of happy children who did not appeat to be affected by the lack of materials. But were extremely grateful when we handed to them pens, pencils, toys and sweets. If we had the chance, we would have taken more, especially educational toys and backpacks for their schooling. It was the highlight of our trip just to see their tiny little faces. We then trvalled up to the next village where we sat and had lunch in a traditional berber village house. The food was very basic but was great to experience traditional home made cuisine! We then drove down to the next valley where we would have visited the markets but because it was a saturday was not possible. Then drove back to the city as the day came to a close. All in all, the best experince EVER and I would recommend to anyone. Have fun x"

Especially for a trip that is to take place thousands of miles away. Luckily, the moment I booked with Adil, I knew we made the right choice. I received a kind, fluent-in-English email minutes later that was helpful in every way I needed. Adil recommended the perfect trip for our needs (a two day, overnight stay through the Atlas mountains, visits to and inside the beautiful Kasbahs, and a stay in a beautiful Skoura village oasis). It was an utter blast. Adil is knowledgeable, he loves his country and its people, and he put together a night of great accommodations. This is better than any tour company I could have booked since its so individualized and Adil clearly has friends all over the country, which allowed us to make very interesting pit stops. Not only did Adil take us on the perfect trip, but I asked a favor of him in advance of my arrival to Marrakesh and he came through in a huge way! The phrase \"above and beyond\" doesn't even begin to cover it. Thanks for a great two days, Adil. If anyone is thinking of taking a day trip or overnight trip in Morocco, this is your guide. You won't be disappointed. Adil, if you ever come to California, please look us up. Best,Andrew"

We ended up confirming our booking for the day after we arrived. Adil arrived in his 4x4 to pick us up at our hotel perfectly on time and spoke great English. Our day consisted of a trip to the Ourika valley, where we visited the local Berber village market where local people gather for their weekly shopping. We then went on to visit an Argan oil women\u2019s cooperative. After this we went off road, to drive up into the mountains, which was a bit hairy at times, but we had complete confidence in Adil who obviously new what he was doing. We then stopped at a Berber village and had a wonderful home cooked lunch of couscous, chicken tagine and melon and of course mint tea. We met lots of local children and gave them some sweets and pencils which Adil had mentioned in his email that we might like to bring with us. I wish I had had the time to be more organised and take more things with us as these children had very little and were so happy and grateful to see us. After lunch we drove back to Marrakech via the Asni valley and the Toubkale mountains. Throughout the day Adil was the most pleasant and kind hearted guide and companion, he has a genuine desire to help the local people and is obviously well respected by all the people we met. All in all a lovely day in which we felt we had seen some of the the real side of Marrakech. I would highly recommend Adil to anyone travelling to Marrakech."

As per the other reviews, our trip with Adil was really amazing and I can't thank him enough for the wonderful day he gave us.We went on Tuesday 9th August, and the week in Morocco was for our honeymoon. He picked us up at 9am from our hotel and took us out of Marrakesh firstly to a village market - we had already visited the city souks briefly on the Monday and the difference is really quite astounding, as we clambered the makeshift paths through the market to see the fruit laid on blankets, the herbs and spices in wicker baskets, the donkeys waiting at the top of the hill for their owners to finish shopping. This was what real Morocco was all about, and we'd only been with Adil for about an hour! He introduced us to the village 'doctor', dentists and hairdressers, and explained how the markets worked.We then got back in the 4x4 (very comfy) and headed through Ourika Valley towards the mountains. We stopped at a shop in the middle of nowhere that sold the most amazing huge rugs, and had really grand views. The lady making the rugs showed me what she was doing and I did a couple of the knots with her.The next stop was an Argan Oil women's co-operative.. where we learnt about (and watched in action) moroccan berber ladies literally squashing and grinding the oil from the argan almond nuts (?), and we bought some of the amazing 'marmalade stage' oil which tastes like peanut butter, and some orange blossom argan oil used for insomnia (it definately works, i've been using it we've got home!). I would highly recommend buying any Argan Oil from these ladies rather than from the city souks.. it's real quality stuff, I mean you watch them actually make it so how much more pure can you get. After some more crazy mountain top single track roads, we are nearly at our berber village and Adil pulls over and we're wondering why, but there were a few guys playing in a little stream of water, and with Morocco being so newly hot to us we had been splashing in fountains at any given opportunity.. so we were quite impressed when Adil took us past the water we could see, up and along the mountain side a bit, and along a track to a waterfall :) a small waterfall but it was so fresh and welcome, and you have a moment of clarity for a second that you are standing in a waterfall on a mountain in Morocco LOL. We then walked back, but this time through the water trough (it was clean) barefooted.. (though I chickened out halfway and put my shoes back on when we got to stones). By this point Adil had encoutered a few berber children and handed out sweets and a football :)We headed up to the village where we had decided to have lunch in a berber house, and honestly it was the best decision we had made not to eat in a restaurant - best meal of the week. The village was very random and seemingly in the middle of nowhere, but the lady who cooked for us was so accomodating and the food was amazing. We had a tagine, with couscous and veg, tomato salad (gorgeous), tomato and carrot soup, and bread.. and a pot of mint tea :) I felt terrible because the lady only spoke arabic despite my best attempt at french (and Adil's help to teach me a few things in arabic in the car), and because of Ramadam we were the only two eating and I know how long it must have taken her to cook for us as Adil had to ring in advance.. aww. Before leaving the village we gave a few things to the children, like some clothes and a few packs of crayons and lego, and the smiles on their faces to receive the smallest things.. they really don't have anything but yet seem so content with their lives because they haven't lived any other way - would highly recommend if you are going, to take a few things for them (aged between 2 and 10), they really appreciate it and especially like balls.On the way back we went via a second valley (Asni?) and then back to the smoke of Marrakesh. The day we spent with Adil really was the best day we had all week.. and we're really glad we booked with him. We would never have been able to do a trip like that in quite the way we did, with such a personal touch. You haven't experienced the real untouristy Morocco until you've been out to the berber villages, and Adil's tour really did make our holiday for us.Thank you again Adil for an amazing day."

We contacted Adil before we arrived and arranged for him to pick us up from our hotel.He arrived promptly and was extremely welcoming and spoke excellent English.We set off at 9 am and headed towards the Atlas Mountains taking in the spectacular views. We stopped at a Berber village for a rest in a very quaint Berber house, where we had a cup of thyme tea with bread and olives. When we left we gave the children of the village some sweets and colouring books and crayons which we had brought with us. I was overwhelmed by the look of pleasure on their faces by such small gifts. A memory both my husband and I will hold for a long time. We then headed on and stopped a couple of times to look at a little water fall and Adil gave a couple of footballs out to a few local boys. These too where greatly received. We went to the oil co-operative which was extremely interesting seeing the ladies work so hard. We had a light lunch overlooking a beautiful valley and then went on to a herb garden. Throughout the day Adil looked after us extremely well and went to great trouble to ensure we did everything we wanted to, even arranging a short camel ride for me. We arrived back at the hotel around 5pm. A thoughly fantastic, enjoyable and memorable day out. Dominic and Lesley"

After that we went off road and visited a Berber village where we had tea in a Berber house and we were back at Marrakech by 6.30 - he even made a detour to a supermarket so that we could buy some beers!

            "review": "Fantastic day out of Marrakech - highly recommended!. We were staying in Marrakech for one week in mid July and went with Adil for a day trip to the Atlas Mountains. Echoing the sentiments of the previous reviews - it was well worth the trip; a great contrast to Marrakech in both landscape and culture. We started the day early, following a similar itinerary to the previous reviews. First stop was a Berber market with fantastic fruit and veg, tagines, dentists (willing to pose for photos) and an abattoir complete with entire cow's head on a wall outside. It was a completely non-touristy and none of the hard sell of Marrakech. Next stop was the Ourika valley. We went to the Argan oil co-operative, had a go at breaking up the Argan nut with the widowed women and were given a demonstration of all the various products they created. No hard sell and a lovely shop. Stopped on a wooden bridge across the valley (see picture) and then onto the waterfall where a guide helped us do a short circuit to see it , much appreciated as it involved quite a lot of climbing/ crossing water, but lots of Moroccans including kids and elderly women were managing it so not too difficult. We then went for a lovely three course lunch by the river for 120 dh, very good food. Next was a drive over into the next valley which was far drier and more remote than the busy Ourika valley. We took an off-road route to get to it which was quite exhilarating and had some great views. Adil is a very good driver and obviously knows the roads really well. We stopped at a couple of good viewpoints and ended in a Berber house for afternoon tea. Rather than sweet mint tea we had thyme which was lovely and they even gave us some dried thyme to take away. The family were incredibly welcoming despite the mother being in the middle of doing her washing and not knowing we were coming cleared everything for us to sit! I'd been concerned that visiting a local family would be a bit condescending or very touristy. However it is a genuine means for the women of the house to earn some extra money in a remote area where there isn't much income. We gave them 100 dh for the tea, but I'd recommend taking some other presents for the kids in the village to leave something a bit more permanent. We hadn't planned to go to the village before we set off for the day, so weren't prepared but Adil tactfully brought a load of footballs for the kids. Although we got stuck in traffic going back to Marrakech, Adil still agreed to stop at a supermarket for us on the way back and answered all of our probing questions about Morocco and tourism in the area. I'd highly recommend this as a day trip or longer trip out of Marrakech, Adil is a great guide, very knowledgeable, accommodating and generous with his time. We even left something in the car and he brought it back to our riad for us. Thank you Adil for a great day out!"

My girlfriend and I booked this from the trip advisor reviews direct with Adil (the contact and tour guide for the day... although he is much more than a tour guide!)We had excellent email responses and I was also able to txt him for confirmation the day before we were due to go on the trip. Adil met us at our Riad on the day (around 8:30) and took us for a full days tour. We had asked to do a few specifc things, and Adil did not disappoint! We were taken to a local Berber market (meat stalls were eye opening!), an Arragan oil co-op, climbed a waterfall, visited a herb centre (which was a last minute addition to the day after we had driven past it!) then went for lunch in a local Berber house. This was great as we got to see a local village, inside their homes and were made to feel very welcome. His tour and knowledge of the area were great! and he was always willing to adapt plans on the day to suit how we felt. He is known in the area (from how many people he said hello to!) and i would recommend tis tour. We had a great day out! Thanks Adil!"

He quickly got the measure of the kind of people we are and the style and nature of things we wanted to see/places we wanted to stay and his recommendations were, without exception, exactly what we were after. He was honest and forthright and didn't try to sell us anything or take us to his cousin's hotel/restaurant etc.We started in Marrakech, drove to Imlil in the Atlas and he organised for us to climb Jebel Toubkal with a great local guide. We then drove through the Atlas, stopping off at beautiful viewpoints and lovely local restaurants (delicious lamb and fig tagine at Lion D'Or) and Kasbahs (the spectacular Telouet), through Ourzazate and to a great place near Skoura above the Oasis called Chez Talout. We drove back through Marrakech, went to a very local restaurant that I would never have considered going to independently, but was phenomenal. A butcher's with skinned goat/lamb carcasses hanging, testicles n'all, out front, a grill and a kitchen full of tagines and the freshest tastiest lamb chops and succulent salad. En route to Essaouira we visited a women's Argan cooperative and even though we were running a little late, having stopped at a Patisserie in Marrakech for delicious cakes, he had persuaded them to stay open for us, He dropped us off by the coast, where he had booked a lovely little place called Dar Liouba, which was centrally located, clean, colourful, simple and great value. Exactly what we were looking for.Overall the 3 days were expensive but we could never have done or organised the things we did without him nor planned such an itinerary where not one second was wasted, niether on a disappointing restaurant nor experience, and yet we never felt rushed. Adil was the perfecting balance between charming guide and companion, with local insights and knowledge, but also gave us our privacy so that it never felt awkward or uncomfortable travelling with him as a couple.Highly recommended."

Very comfortable, with great aircon! The route was all explained and agreed in advance.

It's taken me a month to find the time to sit down and write this review, but my experience was so magically surreal, that I felt it improper not to recommend Adil's services to the rest of the world!There are a plethora of guides to choose from, and selecting a guide to give you a detailed, cost efficient tour can be tricky when trying to make sense of the various options presented. Fortunately, I left this to task to Kyla (my gf) and I'm glad I did!Adil has to be one of the friendliest and most customer focused individuals I've met in my life. He will genuinely go to lengths to ensure the comfort and contentment of his customers and his intimate knowledge of Marrakech's deep, culturally rich history is second to none. Adil will personalise your trip and, rather than pushing a \"standard\" trip onto you, presents various options allowing you to tailor your trip to suit your needs. His enthusiasm and zest for life makes your day(s) with him truly unforgettable. Breath taking scenery, excellent cuisine with local Berbers in their village homes, and frenzied markets are just some of the experiences you'll enjoy with Adil and I'd recommend him to anybody who's sitting on the \"proverbial fence\" trying to select a guide.If I were to return to Marrakech, I wouldn't hesitate to call him again to see more of the beautiful surroundings we missed (there aren't enough hours in the day) and I sincerely recommend his services to those who wish to have an unforgettable adventure."

He is very friendly, with excellent English speaking skills and generally made us feel like we were traveling with a friend. He set up our day trip through emails, offered several alternatives and suggestions and customized the day to our interests. We had a great visit to a Berber market, shopped a little, got some great fried fish and generally saw an interesting counterpoint to the souks of Marrakech. He arranged for a fantastic tagine lunch with a local family in the mountains, even having them prepare a second, egg tagine for our daughter who does not eat meat. Along the way he made stops at an oil and soap coop, an herb coop and some pottery spots, but only at our request, and we definitely felt neither pressured or that he was going to receive a kickback. Later in the week, he drove us from Marrakech to Fes. Because of bad weather (it poured), we elected to take the highway, but he made it interesting, by filling us in about culture and politics and finding a great lunch spot that was clearly a locals favorite. We only had a week in Morocco, so we couldn't do an extended Atlas Mt. / desert trip, but he would definitely be our first choice for any tour or transportation needs in Marrakech if we go back."

            "review": "Adil 4x4 Camel for a real Moroccan adventure!!. If you want a truly amazing adventure with a kind and genuine guide then the only option is Adil 4x4 camel. We recently had an amazing short break in Marrakech which was made extra special by our day trip to the Atlas Mountains with Adil. Adil offers trips in and around the Marrakech area in his new and comfortable 4x4; his prices are good, the level of service is extremely high, trips are tailored to your needs, and you get to see real Morocco. After our adventure in the mountains with Adil I couldn\u2019t imagine how boring a coach trip with 20 other tourists would seem. Firstly we went to a Beber market in a village at the foothill of the Atlas Mountains. It was extremely interesting; Adil took us around the different areas of the market explaining about the people, the place and the different market services. He introduced us to a couple of the vendors who were very friendly and chatty (Adil translated), and he bought us a tasty fried sardine snack which I wouldn\u2019t of dared to try if he hadn\u2019t been with us. My partner even had a shave by the market barber/dentist! He was a lovely man who encouraged us to take jokey photographs of my partner having dental work in the middle of the market! After the market we drove further into the mountains to an Argan oil cooperative. I was concerned this might be a touristy venture, with an emphasis on buying, however I needn\u2019t have been concerned as the cooperative was more of a learning experience. I had heard much about the oil and wanted to know more about it and was given a very informative tour of the cooperative which was run by women only. After seeing the women at work and having listened to the tour guide explain about Argan and the process of turning it into oil for either food or cosmetics, we were taken for a taste test and skin test. The shop itself had fixed prices and there was no pressure to buy. However, after tasting the yummy Argan oil it was hard to resist! We bought a sample of the edible oil and of the massage oil which is supposed to be great for the skin. The next stage of our trip was deep into the Atlas Mountains; and here our adventures really began! We happened to be in Marrakech during the first rains of six months which meant Adil had to constantly adapt the tour due to fallen trees, loss of visibility and roads turning into rivers. We were disappointed not to see the stunning view points which Adil had wanted to show us; however the off-road adventures we ended up experiencing made the trip truly unique. The scenery was still dramatic (misty, lush mountains) and Adil\u2019s 4x4 meant we could travel into the heart of the mountains where we didn\u2019t see another tourist for hours! Due to the hazardous weather it took us a longer than planned to get to the Beber village where we were to meet a Beber family and have lunch with them. However, it was a fantastic journey, constantly stopping to take photos of goats, shepherds, Beber villages and fallen trees in our path. It felt like we got to see a side of Morocco that many tourists don\u2019t; fantastic in our view. When we did get to the village it was amazing to actually walk around the red terracotta streets and to actually see around the Beber villages we had passed on our journey; many tourists only see the villages from a distance. The Beber family were very welcoming and we had the most amazing tagine; better than any of the other food we had had in Marrakech. Adil translated for us and we could ask the family questions about their lives in the mountains and the traditions of the Bebers. It was a truly unique experience. After dinner we went to meet the children of the village. Adil had recommended we bring some sweets, crayons, etc., which we gave to the very grateful, smiley children. You could tell Adil had a really affinity with the people of the village and what a genuine person he is. The experience was uplifting and amazing and we travelled back on a real high. We had a unique and brilliant trip with Adil and plan to keep in touch with him. Adil is knowledgeable, easy going, genuine and very kind. For example, we hadn\u2019t packed clothes for the bad weather so he lent us his jackets and went without. Although our trip was a real adventure, he would be happy to cater for those less adventurous; he asks you what you want and adapts to you. We really cannot recommend him enough! He can be contacted on mfadil3@yahoo.com or adil.camel@gmail.com."

By grace of their flawless customer-friendly experience, the tough terrain of dry and arid arid deserts appears to be a cakewalk. The thrills and spills of life in Marrakech can be never experienced up to the hilt without Marrakech Quad Evasion. They are so cordial and hospitable that one can feel easily at home with them even when they have arrived from distant locations. Two of my friends, who were once nothing short of dummies in bike riding in their earlier days, have now fallen in blind love with this activity so much, and all credit goes to the proficiency and might of their exceptionally talented guides. Moreover, their seamless fluency in English and French is another pivotal factor why I would recommend this firm to people all over the world."

Taking a short break in Marrakech, we were a party of six decided on a quad bike afternoon.So many companies to choose from but these guys were able to help out at short notice. Hotel pick up was a little late but no worries there, then a journey of approx 1/2 hour out to a village and into a small garage / workshop. The quads were waiting, quick demo, after gloves and helmet fitting and we were off. Through the town and into the rocky desert, amazing open space, but the weather was changing, on the the horizon a storm was approaching these guys were prepared with waterproofs for us all to wear, not the weather we were expecting in Morroco. It added a different feel to the afternoon and a memory I shall never forget, incredible trip with really nice staff, very focused on safety and vigilant of our welfare and enjoyment of the afternoon. Give these guys a go."

We shared 3 quads and two of us rode singly. We arranged the excursion from UK by email - responses were quick and courteous. On the day of our trip we were met by one of the team who arrived at the hotel on time. Again he was patient and courteous. Our transport was in a clean minivan and he drove safely to our destination, which took about an hour. After a brief safety check and supervised riding near the lake we went on our journey with one of the guys at the front and another catching up from time to time. The quads themselves are quality machines and safety was always paramount. The guys took us across some breathtaking scenery including the mountains and lakes. The whole experience was around 3 hours. At the end they took us to a local house for some sweet tea and bread overlooking the lake which again was a brilliant end to the day. Our whole group was buzzing and said if they were to ever return to Marrakesh they would want to do the whole day. I try to quad whenever I go abroad and I have to say these guys were excellent. Top marks"

Definitely wear covered shoes and trousers as the heat from the sun and possibly the engine can really get to your legs if your are going in the warm season. Otherwise a loose breezy top will be fine and cooling as the wind blows against you.The mint tea and crepes with honey were a refreshing and well thought out break snack. Definitely recommend.

Have been lucky to go quad biking in Marrakech twice before with another company but fancied a different experience this time so booked the half day quad bkiing near the mountains, lakes and Agafay desert. Booked direct via email. Had a quick response and all booked in. Was told driver would collect from hotel at 9am and we could pay on the day in euros, English pounds or dirhams.On the day the driver was there a few minutes before pick up and drove us for about 40 minutes to the start point. Once there a quick demo, all equipment supplied, forms signed, money handed over and we were on our way. Off up the road to a little area to get used to the bikes then off on our ride we went. Our guide spoke little English but enough to get by. I explained that quite often I tend to veer off and he had me up the front behind him and whenever he felt I needed it he gestured which way to lean etc. No more veering off for me!! (Ended up in a vegetable patch on previous occasions!)The scenery was amazing, much better then our previous trip. We had a stop twice for water (freezing cold and supplied) and at the end you go to a lovely little place for tea and pancakes (even though it was Ramadan we were well catered for). I can honestly say that the views on this particular trip are amazing and the stop near the end overlooking the lake really took my breath away. Once it was over we were driven back to our hotel. There was no photos taken by the company but our guide offered to take loads for us.Tip: wear long trousers as the engines get hot and take plenty of sunscreen !! I really cannot recommend these people highly enough. There were 6 of us ages ranging from 16-61 and every single one of us said it was the highlight of our holiday. Thanks Quad Evasion!!"

We were the only 2 on the trip which added to the personal experience. Very good value also, we paid approx. 700mad each for the half day trip up to Lake Agfay, including gloves, helmet and glasses, plus tea and crepes at a local village (very tasty aswell!), a lot cheaper than many others when we looked. This is a perfect way to spend a few hours seeing the real Marrakech while getting the adrenaline going."

Neither of us had ever been on a quad bike before but what a location to take your first trip - Lake Takerkoust and the Agafay Desert with the backdrop of the Atlas mountains. WOW. We booked the day trip a couple of months prior to arriving in Marrakech but bang on 9am, Youssef was waiting outside our hotel as arranged and drove us out to a little town where we were kitted out. In a matter of minutes, we had been given our safety demo and were ready to go! The morning flew by and we were having lunch before we knew it. The restaurant we dined at (le Relais du Lac) was beautiful and in an idyllic setting. The food was incredible although we have absolutely no idea what we ordered as the waiter couldn't speak any English. It was a surprise when it came but like I said, it was really great. The afternoon passed as quickly as the morning as we weaved through villages and into what felt like the middle of nowhere. The desert really is stunning and so peaceful. We ended our day at a small cafe for crepes and mint tea which was shared with chickens and a cat. Lovely. Overall, an enjoyable break from the busy Medina and brilliant value for what is a full day out including meals. I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Marrakech. Oh, and we also received photos of our day by email when we arrived back to the UK - a nice touch.If I did have a small criticism though, it would be that our guide Ahmed's English wasn't great so he didn't understand a lot of our questions but his English is a lot better than my Arabic so I can't really complain."

I simply emailed Youssef from the hotel and asked if he had any availability, luckily he was able to squeeze the two of us onto a half day excursion near the Atlas Mountains. The price was extremely reasonable (our hotel offered quad biking but we later discovered that it was only around the Palmeraie and they wanted more for it!) The excursion was fantastic from start to finish and every little detail was thought of. Having never been on a quad before I was very nervous but Youssef was fantastic and made sure I knew what I was doing! I absolutely loved it and so did my partner.

The location is good, there are toilet facilities onsite but no payment by credit card so we paid cash on the day. The driver is willing to stop by an ATM should you need to get money out. Our quad bike guide was Zacharias and although his english wasn't perfect we had no problem communicating with him during the afternoon bike ride we had. They are safety conscious and will give you a full briefing about the bike as well as doing some test driving near the site before you go 'off road'.we have a brilliant 2.5 hours of quad biking and had 2-3 stops along the way. About half way there are refreshments at a berber village with tea and bread/olive oil. Our day is was very sunny and quite dusty so you do get dirty so dress appropriately. At the end of the day we were given a blow clean by a an air pressure hose, which got rid of most of the dust in our clothes.We all had great fun and found the staff friendly and helpful. A great half-day experience."

Having walked around the Medina for 2 days exploring major sites, we wanted to change of pace. Quad Evasion was very fast to respond to our last minute inquiry. It was a no hassle booking and Youssef was very punctual to pick us up in the morning for our Lake Tour (he played good tunes during the 40 min ride). I don't drive and haven't been on a bike for a while so was slow to start. Ahmed kindly split up the group of 4 so that I could go a bit slower. I felt safe the entire time even after gaining some speed and definitely had a memorable experience. Tips: 1) you'll be using your right thumb a lot 2) bring a scarf to wrap your face with since it gets dusty."

We booked quad bikes, dune buggies, scooters, jet ski, excursions to casablanca, atlas mountain, essouria and ouzud falls all in 7days!!

He speaks brilliant English and was very laid back, helpful and informative. He even took photos of us whilst we drove along and emailed them to us. Not something you think about doing whilst you trying to manage a quad bike. If you looking for a truly amazing experience, with good quality quad bikes then book this. It\u2019s worth every penny. The sights and fun we had will forever be etched in our memory. I highly recommend him and his team and they deliver exactly what it says in the information.

After reading reviews on here and emailing the company I opted for the shortest trip as It was my first time on a quad bike. I wore jeans as other people said your leg gets hot and mine did so I was grateful for my jeans, I wore a t shirt too and they provide a helmet. We just got dusty but if it rains you may get muddy too, so take old clothes. We were picked up from our hotel on time and driven about 15 minutes. Brief safety talk and then we all got on our quads and had a little practice. I was the only girl in my group and I wasn't the best. They asked me would I like to join a smaller group or go on the back of my husband and as I didn't want to spoil it for my husband by screaming slow down in his ear I opted for the slower group. I was so glad I did as there were girls and a family with them. I went slow at first and was quite scared but the guides are very patient and if you are Uncomfortable they will help you move your quad. By the end of the trip I had my foot down and enjoyed and felt pleased that I went on my own. Personally I wouldn't say it was easy as it was way outside my comfort zone but explain to the guides and they understand and will accommodate you. We stopped in a lovely ladies house for pancakes and mint tea which was lovely. Take wet wipes just to wipe your hands and face of dust, I always carry these and toilet paper in Morocco. My husband said it was the best quad trip he has been on, for a first timer myself I think I was very good. Paid for this in person once taken to the quad bike site in cash."

Was a little surprised to ride on road for some of the trip but most was off road and it all felt really safe and most of all was fun! We stopped off a couple of times to take pictures which was good and finished by having a drink and some crepes in a local caf\u00e9 overlooking a lake which was lovely.As others have said, you get covered in dust so don't wear anything decent. However, they do blast you with air at the end to try and get rid of most of the dust which was a nice idea and a little surprising! I wore shorts which in hindsight wasn't the best idea as my legs started to burn next to part of the engine block which got quite hot so I do recommend wearing trousers.All in all a lovely morning (probably had around 2hrs on the bike) and definitely recommend it."

We had a prompt start, getting picked up at 9am ready to go to the Lake. Our driver, Marfoud was very punctual and on time. The lake took 40 minutes to get to, but worth every minute of it. The landscapes and scenes were lovely to see as it was a lot different to where we had been before as we had only been in the centre of Marrakech until then. When we arrived at the base, our quads were all ready to go. We put safety helmets on and had demonstrations on how to work the quad bikes properly. I had never ridden a quad bike before so i was a little apprehensive as to how i was going to get on. After we got going, it was very easy to pick up how to control the bikes. Our guide was very nice and gave us hand signals all of the way on whether we needed to slow down or not. We stopped along the way to take pictures and thankfully i now have some beautiful shots of some of the places we stopped. To end the exciting morning, we stopped at a lovely authentic restaurant looking straight onto the lake where we had traditional mint tea and crepes. It really was the best day of our holiday and my friends are all in agreement with me that we are glad we went with the company we did."

Everything was easy i got picked up from my hotel then a 15 min drive out to the desert then maybe 2.5 - 3 hours on the quads the views are amazing the guide was brilliant. He starts the group of slowly to let you get the hang of the quad and slowly builds up speed but by the end your hooning it over all kinds of terrain he was funny and very kind. Dont worry if you feel like you might not be skilled enough on a quad to do this trip, we had a very young girl in our group who was orginally a passenger with her mum but the guide let her drive his quad with him on the back and at one point i checked the speedo and it read 50mph across sand. We stopped at the best locations to take photos. We stopped at a berber village briefly for tea and bread which was really nice. I would highly recommend this quad experience above any others out there. Take my word you will %100 love it and value for money is insane. My advice would be to wear old clothes because you get very dusty and take a rucksack to carry water in."

We climbed steep slopes and raced along riverbeds. At the end we have tea and pancakes before Mafoud returned us to our hotel. It was so good we booked via A quick email to Youssef for a different adventure a few days later. Again we were picked up bang on time and off we went to the palms. This morning was even better than the first. Achmed was our guide this time and we had a ball, crazy running through the desert and palms as well as some impromptu tracks and up some rocky hills. Safety always came first but we were also allowed to really have fun. We have quad biked in many countries around the world but this was the best by far.

I must say I was slightly nervous as I have never done this before however I needn't worry as we had a wonderful young man taking very good care of us throughout the trip. We felt safe and in good hands. It was great driving through the different terrains and even a local village. We stopped a few times and our guide has patiently taken several photos. We were provided with plenty of water and even cola from a road side cafe. At the end we had the opportunity to try some local crepes with apricot jam and mint tea. Loved the local cafe, beautifully decorated and top hospitality.

He explained how to work the quads (in French AND english!) then we set off. The group was split into two as I was a little slower than the others, so we ended up a group of 3 with Mafoud leading. I soon picked up speed!It was a totally awesome experience! Some of the hills were quite steep and was scary at times coming down the steep ones and trying to turn into the corners at the bottom! I totally recommend it!! Especially if you're a beginner, like me, as they cater for all experiences.Tea and crepes at the end was a nice touch!"

I booked a few days before via the website and Youssef came back to me within a couple of hours with confirmation & advising pick up times etc. It was just the two of us lead by Youssef and we had amazing fun, we were on the quads for approx. 2 hours and stopped 3 or 4 times en route for a breather & photo opportunities, the views were beautiful. The route was full of a few steep hills and many bends but we felt very safe under Youssef's supervision, and he was good at picking up on our capabilities so sped it up when he was confident in our driving.The quad bike engine becomes very hot and i wore shorts, the heat became unbearable at times against the inside of my lower leg, i would suggest wearing long trousers!The pancakes and tea at the lake afterwards were delicious and with a lovely view overlooking the lake too.Thank you for a great morning Youssef :)"

Quads (350cc Yamaha grizzly) were in good condition and worked a treat. Did some quite steep/bendy/bumpy tracks and visited the lake which was lovely. About 2 hours on the quads in total, there were only 4 of us in total. Mint tea and cr\u00eapes were lovely to finish with. Not cheap at 700 dirhams for a quad each (about \u00a346) but perhaps a bit more adventurous than others - all round lots of fun!"

Everything was great: we were picked up on time, had a smooth drive into the mountains, got a nice instruction concerning the quads and how to ride them and were accompanied by a great guide. It was just the two of us (luxury!) and our guide made a lot of pictures with our camera and did not expect anything in return. Beautiful scenery and a nice mint tea with pastries on the shore of the lake to top a great experience!"

After a short while our guide realised that all of our small group only 5 quads could ride (very fortunate) and the pace picked up Flat Out!!! Dried River Beds,Rocks,Hills and Tracks at each obstacle we re-grouped and went through safely more often than not more challenging routes.With stops to catch our breath and photographs a great afternoon for adrenalin junkies.Tea and a snack back at the lake with great views."

Communication with Youssef before the trip was excellent: I originally made the booking for 14 people but changed it a couple of times as some people dropped out and others opted in, and he was always quick to respond and his English is great. On the day itself we got picked up on time from our riad in two comfortable jeeps and taken about 30 minutes outside of Marrakech to the Agafay desert. Most of us had never done quad biking before but we got the hang of it pretty quickly and enjoyed a couple of hours on an excellent route over dirt tacks, scrub land and through a nice old village before ending near a beautiful lake. The views of the Atlas mountains were amazing throughout so I'd recommend it for this alone. The quads can get up to a good pace and the route can be fairly challenging in places if you've not done quad biking before, but if you're up for this kind of thing I'm sure you'll love it."

The trip itself was excellent and wasn't just on flat ground and was up and down hills making the driving interesting and fun. It lasted for about 2 hours and the views were sensational with a few good photo opportunities.After this we went for a very nice crepe and mint tea overlooking the lake.All in all a great trip and would definitely recommend these guys/company for quad biking.Ian (North East, England)."

We booked this the day before the trip an booking was easy, just exchanged a few emails and were picked up from the hotel the next day. Had a brief tutorial on how the quads worked and then 5 minutes of driving an a circle to get the hang of it. Then we were off, this is were the fun begins, we were lead on a trail through the desert area, over bumps, around trunks, through towns, and then up a hill for a great view. The guide was great constant looking back to make sure everyone was doing well and keeping up. He adjusted the speed depending on how fast we were keeping up. It really fulfilled the ability to go fast, and also to go over bumps and through varied terrain. The tracks used were obvious and there were many other groups of quads within this area, but there were so many trails we never interest cited with any of them. Despite having 20 people booked that morning for the trip we were all split into small groups of 4-5 which made it really fun. Half way through you have some tea at a charming house in one of the local villages, and a nice western style bathroom is there. Then you are lead through a small obstacle type course with some really fun bumps and turns, then back to the main area. They then get some of the dust of with an air hose that helps to clean clothes and shoes. I have done this before while traveling and the quads were in rough shape, these quads are in great shape, work well, are fast, and look fairly new which was very nice. It was a great experience a very fun trip and definitely one of our highlights."

Due to a local festival no one had booked in for the afternoon group so rather than move us Youssef gave us our own personal tour (just our small group of 4!). Our tour was lead by our extremely friendly guide also called \"Youssef\" who showed us the ropes and then we were off winding through the desert and small Berber villages. There was a stop to get a panoramic view of the desert and take pics (Youssef was somewhat of budding photographer!) You can also go for a mule ride but we opted out on that as it's not our thing. Next stop was in a Berber village for some lovely local Moroccan \"Whiskey!\" (aka. sweet mint tea!) Then it was blast going through the small dunes and Oasis again stopping for photo shoots with Youssef! Once back at the HQ you're power sprayed with air to rid you of the coating of dust and sand (my brand new airmax were caked! and then suddenly brand new again!)

We paid at the end of the excursion.They were punctual and picked us up from our hotel and they dropped us back as agreed.When I arrived it looked like barren land then I saw the quad biking area which is where we had a short briefing on instructions and safety. The quads are really simple to use as there are only basic functions brakes like accelerate and brake etc so I did not feel nervous (as I initially had). Helmets and hairnets are all provided.As a group, we stopped at a small Berber village where they offered us mint tea(extremely sweet as expected in Marrakech but it felt well deserved and a satisfying break). There I saw the small children who are so adorable and seem oblivious that we had stopped by their village(I\u2019m assuming the children are used to seeing tourists but I felt privileged to be able to be involved in their everyday lives.) I bought some sweets from a shop an old man owned and the children were so excitable when I shared them out. I definitely feel this was a great memory and due to the quad biking excursion was able to experience this.After leaving the village we continued on. The best part of the quad biking is the feel of the Moroccan sun hitting your body whilst riding across the dusty land and absorbing the beautiful scenery around. I did manage to trail off at one point when taking a turn but that was because I was trying to be a daredevil and I learnt speeding around bumps or turns is not a great idea! I would advise not to take turns fast for obvious reasons but if you feel worried there is no need as the instructor is always checking his group members are safe and I noticed he frequently did head counts.After quad biking my husband and I, each had a one hour ride on the camel which was really relaxing. I would suggest trying and having the camel ride booked after around 4pm as even though the ride is relaxing, the blazing heat did affect me. Quad biking really made my trip in Marrakech and the team at Quad Biking Evasion are friendly, organised and I recommend this to anyone who wants to have a mini Moroccan adventure.\u20ac65 each, for 2 hours quad biking and one hour camel ride. Worth every euro!"

Absolutely enjoyed every minute of the trip. The driver picked us up from the apartment promptly and the journey was calm and smooth. Once we got to the location, we were greeted exceptionally and the staff were very friendly. We were given step by step instructions on how to use the quads and the quads worked efficiently and we had an extremely great experience.The staff were great and Youssef in particular is an amazing guy. The camel ride was a great experience and we had a great time and activity altogether. Youssef is extremely friendly and is a very down to earth person and his company and staff are excellent. Marrakech Quad Evasion is highly recommended and is definitely worth the price. Would definantly visit Marrakech Quad evasion again."

            "review": "Astonishing & absolutely outstanding day!. I would highly recommend Marrakech Quad Evasion to everyone who is looking to have a fantastic day quad biking within the desert. We booked half a day of quad biking and camel riding no pressure to pay up front so felt very safe. We were highly delighted with the service which was provided, we were picked form our apartment in a nice clean mini-bus with A/C and traditional pleasant music the driver was very nice, polite and punctual. We were greeted by Youssef when we arrived he gave us an introduction on how to use and drive the quad bikes, where and what we will encounter on the way. The quad bikes were clean, excellent working condition, really easy to operate, helmets with sanitary hairnets and goggles were also provided. There was brief practice period with our guide and put in small groups of 5-6 quad bikes this gave us an opportunity to mix and meet new people. Our guide was very vigilant kept making sure everyone was safe and kept the weak drivers close to him. We drove through the dessert which was combined with sand, stones and plants which made the drive interesting. We stopped at a hill which had some stunning views overlooked Marrakech and opportunity to take some pictures. Then we made our way back to the small village where we had some amazing traditional green tea which was all included within the price. After that we made our way back to base to go on doing camel riding. This again was outstanding, well organized. After camel riding Youssef came to pick us up in his stunning 4x4 and took us back to our apartment. Youssef was a very nice person he was very friendly and welcoming throughout the day he constantly made sure we had a good time not even once he mentioned or asked us regarding money.I would highly recommend Quad Evasion to all I can guarantee you will have a fabulous time and won\u2019t be disappointed. Thanks Youssef, you deserve your high rankings"

Thank you!Booking was quick and easy via e-mail - responses from Youssef were very quick, mine were slow due to dodgy wifi at our hotel, but we booked in the next morning with no problems. No pressure to pay up front so felt very safe.Pick from hotel included in price, punctual, courteous, air conditioned.Intersting drive through marrakech and out the other side to the base. (Our hotel was out of town on the airport side) transfer for us about 40 mins. Quicker if you start in town.Quad bikes looked new, functioned well, easy automatics. Some for singles some larger for two. We had the bigger one and were fine with two on board. Helmets with sanitary hairnets, goggles etc, all included.Quick, effective multilingual instruction and brief practice period. Our young guide was very vigilant throughout the trip, placed those with kids closest to him and kept looking around to check all okay.Terrain fun, exciting to drive over, interesting to look at. This was just a half day trip, mind, just a quick go. The 'desert' planted with wheat, pale lilac flowers, bright red poppies, a camel trip over in the distance, smiling kids in quiet villages. A brief pause for photos atop a small hill - gorgeous views - then down and on towards a glass of mint tea in a village. All included. Knick knacks for sale here but quite surprised by lack of pressure to buy (we'd been to the souks, so were prepared,) Only then do i realise i haven't even paid for the trip yet. Youssef obviously trusts his clientele.Back to base and an intriguing method of blasting some of the dust from our clothes via a gizmo that blows pressurised air. Ineffective, but a nice attempt! Very much enjoyed our trip back to the hotel, again, any drive here gives plenty to see if you love maroccan architecture...Thanks, Youssef, you deserve your high ranking!"

We actually had a private tour, only me and my husband, as the rest of the group would be late, and that was very nice of Youssef that we didn't need to wait. The ride is worth every penny and we would highly recommend it! But look for Youssef, as there are other people offering this kind of experience, but for sure they won't be as nice.

The scenery was spectacular and the people at the village were very hospitable. Youssef collected my group from our Riad and was on hand to answer any questions we had.

Riding the quad bikes was really fun, neither of us had done it before but the group spent some time at the starting point getting used to them. The equipment was well-maintained and we felt safe. Our guide, Youssef, then took us out on the drive. He was very experienced, and took us through a few different types of terrain which was fun. Although we had a great time, we didn't give it 5 stars as we felt that the village stopping point was a bit dull, although recognise that it is probably good to have a restroom stop. Also, there possibly could have been some more in depth information given out before we headed out or whilst we stopped to tell us a bit more about the areas we were seeing.Overall, we recommend it highly and would definitely do it again! There are some really great views and it was nice to get out of the medina."

Saw people advertising quads in the market so came on trip advisor to ensure we got a good one. This was highly recommended and I completely agree. Emailed the day before wanting to come, fast response and happy to accept payment in Dirhams, UK pounds or euros (handy since our last morning and were out of local currency).Picked up on time and we were really lucky that we got a guide just for our group, 3 people. Always felt safe and in control and the bikes looked well kept. A number of opportunities to get photos and our guide was excellent, taking photos of all of us. Me and my husband had shared a bike and for the last bit back to base our guide said I could drive his bike with him on the back which was a really nice touch. If I could give the team 10 stars I would. The price was also cheaper than the touts in the market and no haggling needed so don't waste your time. Book directly here and you won't be disappointed.Thanks again for making my dads Birthday super memorable!"

Unfortunately my dates didn't work for his own personal tour but after telling him my budget he promised me he would get me into another reputable group. When I met him after, he had an associate get me from my Riad to avoid confusion and he informed me I had paid an extra 300 Dirhams which was included in our agreed upon price for a different camp and accommodations than the rest of the group I joined. Wow was I EVER glad he did that. My camp was unreal with my own personal tent with a toilet and shower. I was quite shocked because I didn't expect much in the desert and for the price. The next morning I met back up with my group and their experience was very different than mine. They had shared accomodation and not very nice toilet facilities. They also had to be up really early and spend a few hours on a camel in the morning as well which , for me, the day before was enough. I was grateful to wake up, watch the sunrise at 7:10 and after breakfast had the option to take a jeep back into town to meet the rest of the group who weren't overly impressed with there camp. Thanks again Rachid, you rock and came through for me with an unforgettable experience at a very good price. I am not familiar with dealing with the rest of the company but if they are anything like Rachid they are very professional and really care about the clients experience!"

He even took me to Starbucks at the end of the trip! We got to play in the sand dunes and the camp was more like \"glamping\" than real camping. But...I have to remove a star because nothing was on time. I understand there were variables that could not be controlled (construction, etc.). However, the itinerary said that we would be back between 6-7pm but we didn't get back until 10pm. The reason was that we didn't leave Zagora on time (it was about 2 hours later than we had agreed). We also took an unexpected trip to a spice store and to a pottery store. Every time we stopped, the driver decided to have tea and a snack, so bathroom breaks turned into half an hour excursions. My sister and I had to cancel our reservations for a dinner show because the driver could not keep to a schedule. Also, we did not arrive to Zagora on time because the driver was late in picking everyone up. We had to take the camel ride in the dark - not exactly the trip I was planning. Every time I mentioned that we need to hurry up and get there, I was shut down and told to \"stop being fast fast like a Ferrari\" whatever that means. I am very type A, so maybe this trip would work for someone who is more relaxed, but it didn't work for me."

Myself and my son took the 2 day private tour from Marrakesh which saw us staying overnight in the Dunes of Tinfou which was an amazing experience. With a driver and guide, day 1 included a visit to the UNESCO listed kasbah at Ait Ben Haddou, which is worth a visit in itself. Just beyond the village of Tamagroute, we transferred from 4x4 to camel (dromedary, actually) for a short ride to the camp. Although just on the edge of the Sahara, Tinfou does include a small selection of dunes to give that authentic desert experience. We then settled into our tented camp for the night where we were the only paying guests which was wonderful and which included a fantastic authentic meal and drumming entertainment,The following morning, we climbed the highest dune to watch the sunrise and tried a bit of dune boarding, before breakfast perched on the dunes - what a wonderful memory. This was a well organised trip with the overnight experience well away from the main tourist destinations. There was the obligatory visit to a local community/collective pottery project in Tamagroute (thank you Tariq) but the pressure to buy was not too great and this added some interest to the experience.This was definitely an experience to remember. Thank you Rachid, Lahcen, Karim and Tariq."

Less hassle from vendors although you need to keep your wits about you not to get drawn into unwanted activities such as henna tattoo or cuddling a snake. I felt safe everywhere and we did explore off the beaten track on occasions. Check prices of things like taxis before the start of activities. Beware non French or Arabic speakers - not all the taxi drivers speak English - thank goodness I had my daughter with me for the first taxi ride we took. The biggest con you are likely to experience is exchanging money at a UK airport. They quoted 8 dirham per \u00a31 but got 12 at Marrakech airport. Very easy and quick. We would have lost a third of our money. Change currency back at the same place as difficult to do so in UK. Also if you have the time do a two centre stay - Marrakech and Essaouira for instance - wish we had."

It was a beautifull trip, through the most beautiful drive to the different landscapes. Our guide, Youssef, was really a nice and fun guy. He drove safely and took the time at the places where we stopped. We never felt pressured (what we sometimes heated with bigger groups) and if we wanted to stop at other places was no problem. He also taught us more about the country. We booked this trip one day in advanced and Rachid replied really quick and was very friendly.The trip itself is worth going and we thought this company had a really good price for the amount of people you were traveling with. We started in Marrakech and wanted to finish in Fez. Only they found out the day before that our bus was not leaving to Fez until the evening. Racjid and Youssef did everything they could to arrange a other option (with more people in a taxi to Fez). So that was also a good service.The only thing i could think of is that with four persons in a car there is not too much space. So i hope for the bigger people they have bigger cars :pYes, like almost every organised trip abroad, this is very touristic. This means you get to places (restaurants, sights) there are lots of tourist. Touristic also means you get to see the most beautiful places. If you don't like this, you can better go private with or without guide.Thanks again Youssef and Rachid."

Rachid is also very fast answering all kinds of questions as it felt at almost any time. We didn't hesitate to tell him any of our concerns. He was always very friendly and professional. On the day of the tour we had a very early start with Kamal, our driver and guide, who is an extremely cool and knowledgable guy, who even went out of his way for one of the meals, when we wanted to eat some sandwiches instead of sitting in a restaurant, and took us to a really nice snack place. I also got my best souvenir from the trip from him. You can ask him about it. The camp itself was amazing and Nordin (the chocolate guy as they call him) and the gang there made for a great reception and even lovelier night with drums, fire and star gazing.

Went to Morocco for the first time with one friend, having 10 days to spend along the southwest and a lot of options to choose from, when booking a trip to the desert.From the whole lot of offers, Morocco Discover Tours offered exactly what we wanted: 3 days trips, with plenty to see in a tight but flexible schedule, at what seemed a fairly reasonable price, at the moment. As I write this review, I actually think it was the best spent money in all the trip.Rachid is a young, funny and versatile guide. He will not just present you Morocco as it is written in the books or just point out through the window what you're supposed to watch... He actually teaches you the way of living in Morocco, the mixed cultures, the less turisctic aspects and has a fair share of surprises under the sleeve (have you ever heard about the Berber pizza?). We were actually very lucky to be able to travel in a small pack (5 tourists + Rachid + driver) - and after the first day together, you're like family! - since it gave us the chance to personalize the tour and discuss many options and places to visit. It was a great way to experience the desert, the mountains, the monuments, the people and end up feeling like you've grown a fair share of knowledge and a secret or two about the places you visited, after only 3 days. And for solid Rachid will be the guy who has your back: he'll make sure you have fresh food every day, he'll know where to stop, he'll know what to show you and you'll fell rewarded for your choice.I really hope to come back to Morocco to a Northern/East trip to explore more of this magnificient country... And I know I'll call Rachid.Safe trips!"

He drove us through the high Atlas mountain and the mid Atlas. The views are stunning and he would stop frequently for us at good spots for pictures and as and when we needed a drink or to use the washroom. He is quite patient, I must admit because at times we did take our own sweet time with washroom breaks and he was totally fine with it. He is probably one of the few ppl I can say who has beyond excellent driving skills down winding roads, maneuviring with precision. That is how much of a careful driver he is. He has an exceptionally clean car with air conditioning and it's a brand new Ford, so very comfortable. He also made us an excellent sheesha and chilled with all of us, just cause we said we would liked to do that. Many companies offer this very trip to see the ait Ben haddou, ouarzazate, rose valley, Dades valley and night spent in Sahara Desert camp, but rest assure with Ismail you are guaranteed an awesome time."

PS: if you're thinking of renting a car and head out to Merzouga on your own, I'd advise against. Me and my friend did so on another part of the country: money-wise it was practically the same but experience-wise we ended up missing some gems on our trip. Trust Rachid, he knows where to stop, he'll show and talk about all the hidden places, he'll make sure your food is fresh and you won't be tired from driving for hours and hours (which means you'll take more out of what he shows you)."

Morocco is such a beautiful country and we highly recommend this trip and Discover Morocco. Their guides are friendly, intelligent and helpful. The trips can be tailored to your interests so make sure you talk to your guide and let them know if you do not want to do something. For example, we preferred to get back to Marrakech earlier rather than see the TV studios so we skipped that! They are not intrusive and will give you more/less information where you show interest. Read the small print - it is a long journey so be prepared to spend around 12 hours on the road although there are plenty of stops of interest along the way and lots of information from your guide. The guides speak multiple languages. Camping is in the desert and we had a tent to ourselves, food is great and there is music and a fire afterwards. Highlights included the camel trek, the stars in the night sky (unbelievable), the sunset and sunrise in the dunes and the scenery during the drive. Would highly recommend this company (and the transfers to and from the airport are great)!"

My 2D-1N at the desert birthday experience:Friends recommended me the tour with them, specially Rachid, and it was the best advice I have been given in various years. Rachid was very responsive and keen to help even from before we formally booked the trip, recommending hotels and everything. This would only increase and get better along the trip. He and Risham picked us up from the airport and got us to our hotel. Next day picked us up early morning for a nice history lesson along the way and along a great music mix of anything you can think of. We made a great bonding since the beginning and dance in the car and everything. Breakfast was perfect, Risham's driving was exceptional, Rachid's stories, history lessons, funny anecdotes and fun facts made our morning. We stopped couple times to enjoy the views of the mountains, Berber culture, etc. We enjoyed of the famous Ait-ben-haddou where we went to a Berber's house, saw techniques of art and a lot of time to enjoy and take pics. We then headed to the desert where it was one of my best experiences of my life. On my bday getting to a camel a ride it for 1hr+ then got treated like a king by very friendly, charismatic, funny, humble and most unique Berber people, specially Negrito por el mundo. We gave ourselves nicknames, made jokes, talked about life, etc. it was full moon amd the view couldn't get better. We had dinner made and served by the Berber, which was the best I ate at Marrakech, on top of a dune with wine which Rachid helped us picking. After that we had the bonfire and music. I engaged playing percussion and guitar and to be honest I felt home, like I was spending my bday with friends and family.For my surprise they started singing happy birthday in various languages and one of them picked me up to the restaurant and there was a bday cake. That reassured me that I was part of them and they were part pf me, as well that the decision to book this tour was the best decision ever. Next day woke up early, after sleeping well in the tent, to watch the sunrise and they got us a full-on breakfst. We made our way back to Marrakesh with some stops to see the culture, how the Berber made their living, etc. it all ended dropping us to the hotel. Next day they picked us up and dropped us at the airport. Finally, I will definitely recommend this experience to everyone I meet. And even to myself, bc we all need a break like this from the stress at work or simply life. I feel really grateful and blessed for the service, gifts and efforts done by Rachid and Risham. Will never forget what we lived through and it is virtually impossible to top this birthday trip. Thanks to both for everything and making me feel at home and with friends and family. Rauluy"

Youseff took care of us and we all really enjoyed this trip. I must say it was the best part of my 7 days in the country. We saw a huge part of Morocco, and end up in Merzouga desert that was even better than in the pics. It was a 2/3 days long trip where we ate with local people, dance, play music, talk and know by better hand the culture. It's a tour indeed for all the family, at it's not rough or too challenging. Maybe i missed a little bit that! :) A big huge to Youseff, and Rachid was at all time patience with me answering all my questions prior the journy. Reliable 100%"

He was very friendly and knowledge about the areas we visited. The drive through the Atlas Mountains towards Tinfou Dunes really demonstrated moroccos beautiful landscapes. We had mini tours in historical sites like Ait Ben Haddou and the Draa Valley with very knowledge local guides. The highlight was visiting Tinfou dunes for a camel ride and camping in a berber tent. The night there was magical! Everyone at the camp was friendly and professional providing food and music to round out the night. Mustafa got us back to the city safely and it felt like we took a trip with a friend not just a tour guide. The whole team at DiscoverMorocco are excellent! I would recommend any excursion with this company when visiting morocco. I wish we could have done more trips with them!!!"

            "review": "Best Birthday Surprise EVER- Thank you, Rachid for making us feel so SPECIAL and LOVED ! Expectations exceeded !. It was my second trip in Morocco so i have a good base to compare and i must say Rachid exceeded my expectations and managed to make me and my partner feel so special...The first time I did this crazy road trip, we were with a local guide on a private tour which was quite exotic (think sleeping on an old carpet in the middle of the palm trees with the muddy river as our luxury swimming pool in hot August).I must admit I had reservations if the group tour would be as good as the private one (i am a fan of authentic experiences) but being on a very tight budget and with limited time to organize, I started contacting the best tour operators on Trip Advisor...All of them said they don't organize group tours which is quite understandable considering it's half the price... and just when i thought it's impossible to go to the desert for less than 350 euros per person, Rachid replied- YES and i was so happy and excited...120 euros for 3 days including petrol, 2 breakfasts, 2 dinners and 2 nights, 2 guides... sounded more than reasonable... He replied to all my emails very quickly and accommodated even the smallest request- from organizing vegetarian meals to recommending a good hammam for our last night in Marrakesh...What i didn't expect was the BIG surprise Rachid had prepared for my birthday... In a country where so many people try to take as much as possible from the tourists (understandably so as this is their main source of income) and during their high season, Rachid decided to reduce the initially agreed price by 50% purely because he couldn't be our guide (his group tour was cancelled in the last minute but he didn't cancel ours). On the morning when he came to pick us up at the agreed time , he gave me a beautiful silver necklace with Fatima hand which i felt protected me throughout the whole trip (totally unexpected as i am just a stranger, a customer who happens to have a birthday) and then announced that the last surprise is that instead of being in the camp with the 2 groups (which we later discovered had no toilet, running water or any facilities but tents with 6 mattresses), we will be alone in a luxury camp as a birthday present.... What an experience- just the two of us on the camels in the middle of the sand dunes watching the sunset, a whole camp for us with 3 friendly, welcoming people waiting to serve a beautifully presented, delicious 3 course meal that we were trying to finish as it was so good but we were too full just after the delicious starters... the tent had a king size bed, en-suite bathroom with hot water powered by the solar panels just next to the camp, everything was immaculately clean and it was our best night in Morocco (even if we stayed in good riads in Marrakesh)... Just the perfect 5* gateway - Desert Camp Bouchedor True, the private tour allowed more freedom to explore many places... but did I feel like a princess? We saw so many things- beautiful canyons, high cliffs, green mountains, the highest desert dunes, exotic palm gardens- a diverse landscape offering so much to photographers like us that we beat our own record with the 1600 photos taken in just 4 days :) recommend it ? absolutely, undoubtedly, totally YES ! For couples, for friends, for families, for solo travelers.... You will all have an experience that will stay with you long after you are back home.... so different from the all inclusive type of holiday when all you do is sunbathe, eat and explore the souks in Marrakech (not that this is bad- it's ok for people who need a total break from everything) .... but this will give you MEMORIES FOR LIFE.... truly magical..."

Our experience within this tour and thanks to our private guide Youssef Ait Addi was simply an unique life's experience. Our adventure started in Marrakech to end in Tinfou Dunes.

On the way we also visit many point of historical interest. When we arrived there were camels waiting for us in our camp into the Dunes. We spent an unforgettable night with the guide and the Berber Trib, who were singing and playing bongos for us. Your guide to the desert and the people who you gonna meet there will be part of your journey so is very important choose the right person. Thats why we want to recommend this tour and Youssef as your guide: he is a good speaker of English, a good driver, is very available to any request and he knows how to be professional and close at the same time. He is going to take care of you!"

The evening with the Bedouin was great fun and we were surprised to have our own tent even though it was a group tour. The camel ride was good fun with the group. Being in a group wasn't a problem at all, I would definitely recommend this over a private tour, which is much more expensive. There were only 2things which were slightly disappointing: the food at the road-side stops was not very tasty, and tourists prices. Also the Tinfou Dunes are not massive, I was expecting Sahara-like landscape but the dune rises out of the flat rocky desert. But these things didn't ruin the trip and overall I would definitely recommend this tour. The Moroccans couldn't have made us feel more welcome and really made the experience enjoyable."

Kamar drove really well and was very patient when my daughter felt car sick. Eventually we were turned back as the snow had closed the road. So we regrouped and took another option to visit the waterfalls. The following day Rachid and Kamar took us to Essaouria for the day. We had a brilliant time. Rachid looked after us so well and organised a guide in Essaouria. He chose the best of the fish and seafood and had it cooked fresh for us. We all enjoyed an amazing lunch.

Never once did he make me feel rushed during our stops. When we arrived to our destination in the desert we kept our bags in his car so we wouldn't have to take them with us on the camel ride. After the camel ride he met us at our camp site right away and asked us how everything went. He seemed very receptive and intuitive to all of our needs and when we all wanted to have privacy within our group. On the trip back he was just as good about letting us stop whenever we wanted.

We were all in the same age.I like roadtrips and you drive a lot!!! For me it was the perfect way see the beautiful landscape of this country. Everyone in Marocco drives crazy. Our guide (forgot his name) was a very good driver. I felt nearly always safe except when he drove sometimes with 70 km/h just 2 m behind another car. But he saved our lifes as he evades very quick off the road as another car was falsely on our lane in a curve. That was very good, because the passenger airbags were turned off!!! We were also not allowed to turn them on!!! We did not get a lot of information about the country from our guide. Unfortunatelly I recognized only now that we neither visited the town Telouet nor the Atlas Film Studios!!! Instead we had lunch in overprized restaurants with dry chicken. Just at the third day we could conviced the guide to bring us to a local place. 6 people ate for the same price as one did in the other restaurants. He also brought us to shops, but himself bought his water and snacks somewhere else... this is embarrassing!!! We had also no chance to dicover A\u00eft-Ben-Haddou alone. We were pushed through the town by another guide without information.The first night was in a clean hotel. There was also a maroccan family and we did music until the night. This was very nice.I have no problem with stopping at local manufactures and cooperatives which want to sell blankets, argan oil and carpets, but then I also want to stop at a beautiful place to enjoy the landscape and do some photos.The tour to the berber camp by dromedary was organized very well. We had a spacious dinner with other young groups. Then there was music again but everything was agganged and inauthentic. We got very good information from the desert berber guide and enjoyed the incredible stars in the sky.The last day was just driving. I liked it, but we did actually just stopped for lunch.All in all a good way to see the country. I had a lot of luck with my group. The guide did a good job driving us around, but a very bad job giving us information about his country. That he also forgot to bring us to Telouet and the Film Studios brings me to the conclusion that I can not recommend this company! I also do not understand why the passenger airbags were turned of!

Speaking little French or Arabic, we were still able to interact with the locals. My daughter had a wonderful time playing with the village children. Overall, I feel that Discover Morocco offers us a peace of mind. no worries about pick up from the airport, getting from A to B, accommodation and what we are going to eat on a daily basis? its all pre-arranged to your personal preference. Personally, for me this is my ideal holiday/break. It takes you away from the daily routine of work etc in your normal daily life and truly gives you that relaxation that you need when you getaway! A word of thanks to Rachid, our lovely tour guide Abdellatif and all that we met who made our break so memorable. see you next time!"

We were only in Morocco for a short holiday and this was a great way to see the Atlas mountains and some of the Moroccan countryside. Booking the tour was easy, Rachid replied promptly and provided answers to any and all questions within 24 hours. Having a Moroccan driver/guide was great opportunity to ask questions and learn about Moroccan culture. We were encouraged to stop for pictures whenever we wanted. I was a little scared about what driving on the Moroccan mountain roads would be like but it was fine! Our driver was very safe, the car was comfortable, clean, and a newer model, the roads are in great condition and it was a beautiful scenic drive. If we ever go back I would book another tour with them again!"

In fact it exceed our expectations. Our first contact was with Rachid, with whom I communicate only via email. After a few discussion we agreed for a 2 days trip to Tinfou Desert and 1 day trip to Setti Fatma Waterfall.Both tours were great and one of the main reason for having this nice time was also our driver/ guide Youssef \u201cScorpion\u201d. Our experience did not start perfect in Marrakesh as we had to wait almost 3 hours at the passport control in airport. But Youssef was still waiting for us and he did not even received our SMS in which I was trying to let him know it will take a long time to get out from the airport.The road to the Tinfou Desert is long. So be prepare for a long drive but there are stops on the way were you can enjoy nice sceneries, villages and also there will be breakfast and lunch breaks.In the last day we enjoyed a lot the visit we made to the traditional Berber house and the breakfast was wonderful.I was together with 3 girls (one teenager) and we did not had any kind of problems. Marrakesh city was also a really nice surprise (except Medina part that was too crowded for us and did not spend much time there).Thanks again Rachid and Youssef and hope we manage to see each other again in the near future."

Rachid was quick to reply and I had a very smooth pre-trip arranging for this tour. Our driverguide for the trip, Abdellatif, was really amazing as well! He was super humorous and informative, and we were very entertained by him throughout the tour. He spoke good English, and was accommodating to stopping the vehicle whenever we want to take photos(: He was also great in giving food recommendations. We tried all the exotic food he recommended and were not disappointed! Sunrise, sunset and the night sky were gorgeous too.Everything about this tour was great except for a small incident: After the nomad camp stay, we were brought to a mini pottery tour. Everything was great until the pottery tour guy explicitly asked for tips when we refused to buy any souvenirs from him. It was quite ridiculous because he had this small talk with us the previous night, saying stuff like he just wants to make friends and not be concerned about money. And in less 12 hours he's asking us for money?!That aside. I would strongly recommend this tour to people visiting Morocco! (but we felt that 2D1N was a litte too short)"

When my friend and I decided to take a tour to the desert while visiting Marrakesh, we got overwhelm by the tons of offering available in the market. After reviewing some of the options, we decided to book a 2 days desert tour with Discover Morocco Day Tours as its review were quite nice and the price was very competitive. Communication was very good before the trip.The day of the tour, we got pick up at our Riad right on time and transportations was very comfortable. Rachid was with us all the time and he proved to be very knowledgeable regarding the different points of interest and the berber culture. When we got to the desert, we were immediately greeted by our rides, in other words, Dromadaires. The \"camel treck\" lasted around 1 hours and allowed us to enjoy the beautiful sunset and the moon coming up. Priceless! After the camel ride, we got to our camp that it was run by nomads. They prepared delicious food for us! We also gather by a bonfire and dance to the rhythm of their drums and other musical instruments. I had so much fun, that the night passed by so fast. I would definitely won't forget that night.On our way back we visited Kasbah, which is a famous location where movies are filmed. If you have seen movies like Cleopatra, Gladiator, just to mention some of the bunch, you have definitely seen this on the tv or movie screen. It was surreal been there.My friend and I had one of the most wonderful experiences and were very please that we pick this tour company for our desert experience. Rachid was always going the extra mile. Definitely, the best tour guide that I have ever had. Totally would recommended this tour!"

Prior to booking this trip, my friend and I searched many companies offering a very similar experience throught the Atlas Mountains and Zagora Desert. Several were far more expensive and seemed to offer the same exact thing. After reading reviews, pricing and communicating with the others, we chose Discover Morocco Day Tours and the 2-day Tour to the Desert. Rachid was fantastic in completing our booking, confirmed with us the day before and was punctual when he sent for someone to pick us up promptly the morning of the tour. Our guide, spoke fantastic English, had a great sense of humor and was incredibly knowledgeable of every town and culture of the \"Berbers\". The first stop was in Ait Berka for Breakfast of which was a cute spot with fantastic tea and coffee overlooking the mountains, next we passed through Aglmous Village then stopped for lunch in Ourzazate. The drive continued through the vast mountain range passing through Ait Souen, Agdez, Zagoura City and then we arrived in Tinfou Desert. Upon arriving in Tinfou Desert we were immediately greeted with two Dromadaire (Camels with one hump not two) I quickly learned! Lol. We rode them for about 45-60 min and our guide for the ride was adorable he would stop in several spots to take pictures of us. As the sun came down it was quite unique to see the moon coming up over the mountains at the same time. As the ride concluded we were greeted by our tour guide and the Berber community at this camp. We had a great dinner, bonfire, music (they are so talented!) and slept in a tent. In the morning, we were served tea/coffee and pastries before we hit the road. On the way back we stopped in Kasbah for lunch and the tour of a famous location where many movies were filmed. In fact, they were filming one while we were there. The village is elevated of what appears to be in a mountain and centuries old that certainly takes you back! It was a wonderful and very memorable experience and I would certainly do it again! Thank you Rachid for your wonderful hospitality and for making this experience possible!"

I have chosen this travel agency after all great review on Tripadvisor.I was ready to pay more, and when you are ready to pay more YOU MUST READY TO RECEIVE MORE\u2026Unfortunately it did not happen and besides the service received, also the tour itself, it is not such a great tour,At the end I would say, be ready to find the cheapest tour as all of them offer the same service, at least you will not feel robbed.Here my personal comments1) The promised English speaking guide turned out to be an elementary English knowledge guide.2) As the lunch was not included, I would expect to have the possibility either to eat with the entire group or to eat somewhere else, or go for a walkHe always took us in the restaurants he wanted without giving us any alternative. On the way back we stopped for Lunch in a stranded place, in the middle of nowhere.Therefore no other places, or possibility to do something different.3) We were promised to have a private tent, for 2, when we arrived the guardian told us that all of tent are for 4 people and he would not have cared.Besides he was smoking JOINTS..yes JOINTS...he even asked my gf a rolling paper, in front of us, and the guide left us to go to the camp on ourselves with locals without any support. At least he would had came with us and check if everything was fineBefore leaving all group alone. We were told: other companies are cheaper because they offered tent for 8 people. The real truth is that ALL TENT ARE FOR 4\u20264) Food quality in the desert is really poor from Dinner to Breakfast5) You ride the camels just before the sunset is over.6) The camp is just located on the border of the desert just a couple of Dunes, if your expect to be surrounded by Dunes, forget it7) Ait Ben Haddou, the only place, which was worth visiting and maybe staying there to have lunch walk around, I gently asked: why do not we have lunch here? The guide answer: because we take you to a placeWhich we trust\u2026.well we ended up in a small caf\u00e8/restaurant in the middle of no where\u20268) The tour should be tailored IN A BETTER WAY\u2026I talked to Rachid and he offered me a compensation of 400 Dirham, which was a good-gesture form his side, and he felt sorry, however instead of the compensation he tried to offer me a complimentary taxi to the airportAffirming that for a transfer to the airport at 04.30am next morning, would had cost euro 30/35\u2026well I gently denied his offer and I took back the 400 Dirham, in fact the taxi cost me JUST 70 DIRHAM/7 euro\u2026At the end I would suggest, if you really want to make this kind of trip (I will not do it again even for FREE..LONG DRIVE..all curves/bends), check for the cheapest company which offer you the same tour for 50/55 euros. You can also have (asking) the transfer from airport upon arrival to your accommodation. At least you would not be disappointed with all great expectations."

My boyfriend and I booked the 3 day Desert Tour with Rachid after we compared many different tour & excursion companies online. Not only was the price the best out of 6 that we asked, Rachid was the only one who was patient with all of our questions and emails. You'll be amazed by how fast he replies! The trip was amazing from beginning to end. On our first day, Rachid came and picked us up from our riad on time like he said, helped carry our heavy backpacks to the car, introduced us to the friendliest driver, and our wonderful journey begun. Every stop we made on our way to the Sahara was amazing. Rachid would explain the area and sites to us, give us as much time as we like to explore the place, and even help take wonderful photos for us. & because of Rachid, we also met some of the most amazing people, including the local Nomads, Berbers, and our camel ride guide Hassam. By the end of this tour, we truly became good friends and promised he'll always have a place to stay if he came to visit us in Canada! If you are considering any type of excursions or tour in Morocco, definitely go with Discover Morocco Tours! After a long 3 weeks of visiting Italy, France, and Morocco, my boyfriend and I both agree that the 3 day Desert Tour was definitely the best part of it all. Thank you again, our Moroccan brother Rachid!"

Our guide Abdel was amazing - his knowledge of the Morrocan history and landscape was astounding. Not to mention he was a really fun guy. To top it all off, after the tour, Rasheed, the owner, invited us into his home for dinner (homemade Tagine). It was clear this was way more than a business transaction to them.

From the moment we sent our inquiries, Rachid was very prompt in answering all our many questions before we even booked their service. We are very pleased we decided to go with Discover Morocco. From the time we were collected in our Riad at Marrakech, to our many significant stops at the Atlas Mountains, Rachid made everything as smooth as possible, he was very knowledgeable, flexible with the schedule and our route. Each step of the tour has its unique and amazing impact on me and my wife. Particularly noteworthy to us is how Rachid involves locals outsourcing so they would also earn and the local economy benefits. We stopped at a local cooperative at the Atlas mountains, Rachid worked with locals in the Sahara, from the camel ride guides, to the nomad camp where we stayed. On the way back the following day Rachid involved another local guide when we stopped at Ait Ben Haddou. We had an amazing time from start to finish. We learned a lot from Rachid, met amazing people, partake into the local culture and totally enjoyed the sights and sound of the Sahara. First hand experience from picking dates from trees, stopping at Henna farms and showing us some local cotton trees. I rarely give a 5 star rating. Discover Morocco has exceeded my expectations and deserves the 5 star rating. Its all worth it. If we are to have another trip to Moroccco I would not have second thoughts booking another tour with Rachid."

Our first day we drove through the Arlas mountains and filled our eyes with amazing sights. We also stopped at a woman run Argan cooperative and my biggest regret for the trip was I didn't bring cash to buy the products - they were amazing and the woman who showed us the process was very informative. You cannot believe it but we actually got rained out of the Sahara desert the first evening so we could not to ride the camels to the camp but Rachid rearranged for a dawn ride which was amazing! In stead we had impromptu delicious tea at his friends house and shop and then we drove to camp where we honestly ate the best Tagine we've ever tasted. We were serenaded by drumming and songs by a campfire under stars that night. And we woke up the next day to watch the sun rise from the top of a sand dune - and of course ride the camels! The second day was equally fantastic - Rachid stopped to buy us the best dates from the Draa Valley and we even stopped and picked them fresh off the trees. We also visited Ait Ben Haddou and had a personal tour of it and inside a local home. At all times Rachid was full of local and personal knowledge about the Berber people and culture, and ever ready to answer my many questions. We can't thank Rachid enough for our amazing time!

From the moment, we landed in Marrakesh, we were well looked after by Discover Morocco . The friendliness and hospitality was really lovely especially since we were travelling with our children. The whole booking and organisation of the tour was really good. Also, I feel what made it so special is that our input of what places we wanted to visit was taken in account. A copy of the Lonely planet was good to have as a guide when discussing with the tour operators of what and where to go!Overall, we travelled north to Fez visiting many places en route with plenty of breaks which made it quite a chilled out experience. It didn't feel that you were always in the car! Amazing views we saw as we took the Atlas mountain scenic route.Two days in Fez was wonderful. To experience the wonderful historical and cultural experience with our city tour guide. Quite a contrast from the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh. In my opinion, Fez was quite laid back and relaxing while staying in a beautiful Riad in the old Medina. Our journey took us south to the Merzouga desert with daily activities en route. Observing the monkeys and horse rides. Again, the journey was long but well-planned so there were sufficient breaks to relax with the locals. I've experience desert camping before but Merzouga experience was out of this world. A camel ride to our camp, which took 2hr and then greeted with Morocco Tea on arrival. The food was like a banquet and the accommodation was clean with excellent bathroom facilities. The camp fire and the singing was uplifting to experience.The rest of the tour involved travelling west back to Marrakesh. Gorges, mountain villages etc. After an overnight stay in Marrakesh, we were travelled for a few days to Agadir which was arranged by us but, Discover Morocco arranged the transport.. Since, we travelled from London to Marrakesh, we had our outbound flight from Marrakesh. we phoned Discover Morocco who arranged transport back to the airport.what more can I say except I'm going back at Christmas!!!!!"

We were collected at our hotel by Abdull spot on 8am and taken to our transport for the day. He was great at explaining what we were going to do and in what order and sharing information as we went.Our first stop was at a Berber house for breakfast, I am always sceptical about these types of visits as ones I have been to in the past feel like set up houses but this felt so real. We wandered down a path through a gate in a wall and were inside a little compound, the family greeted him as a long lost friend and there was a genuine warmth on both sides. He showed us their personal Hamman and how they would light the fire to heat the water for it, onto the animal area where there were a couple of cows and a week old calf. Back to the house and he showed us where the stream outside had been channelled through the wall for washing and then into the kitchen area. The cooking area was two open fires where pots, tagines, trays could be placed over them. We were taught how to make mint tea, which was lovely and watched as our bread was cooked on the open fire. It was served with butter from the cow we had just seen and was like cottage cheese in texture and just the most amazing taste, there was honey (local and the most amazing ever) and olive oil. I could have stayed there all day eating that!Then on to our camel ride, just 20mins and to be honest that was enough to say we had tried it, Abdull took some great photos of us and we had a little caravan going as there were 3 camel calves that wandered along with us. The owners were lovely and also took photos and encouraged us to hold the camels while they did, no hint for tips simply nice people. On to the Atlas Mountains and we met another guide who trekked with us up through two villages where we had lunch at the 3rd on a balcony with amazing views. More mint tea and a tagine as requested by Abdull when we expressed an interest in them.On the way back to Marrakech we stopped for our quad biking, which was fun but the goggles are not that clean so a bit hard to see through at times.When we got back to Marrakech as we were not sure how to get back to our Riad from where we had parked Abdull walked back with us without hesitation. We were contacted by Rachid afterwards to make sure we had enjoyed our day and offering a free airport transport if we wished, having already arranged the hotel we declined but otherwise it would have been brilliant. All together we had been out from 8am to 6.30 by the time we got back, what a day!"

He made our experience 10 times better and we were more prepared in the desert than any other tour. We were two teenage girls exploring and thanks to Abdellatif we never felt endangered. He knew how to fix every problem that we had with the upmost quality. I would recommend this tour to anyone and specifically Abdellatif."

Rachid was a good friend by the end of the day; he was gracious in telling us about the local area/sights as well as Moroccan and Berber culture, and answered all of our questions as well as just being very fun to chat and joke with!We had another guide for a small section of the tour around the waterfalls themselves and then met up with Rachid for lunch overlooking the falls (which was lovely, proper lamb tagine)..... Lunch/breakfast/drinks and things along the way Rachid paid for, he was incredibly generous and bought us souvenir gifts too and we got to meet some monkeys on the way back. Such a wonderful day, I couldn't recommend this more especially if you want to chat to somebody local and learn a bit about Morocco itself. Thank you so much Rachid, was an absolute pleasure meeting you!!"

The car was spacious and very comfortable we were asked if we preferred the air conditioning on or off which was nice.Our first stop was to a traditional berber house which was great, we had a look about and saw tea being made, after that we took a camel ride which was really fun! We then made our way up to the waterfall where a guide arranged by the driver guided us on the short trek to the waterfall. The guide was great very informative.We ate lunch in the river then returned back to our hotel.Our driver Kareem (sorry for the spelling!) was just great, he made sure we were at a comfortable temperature whilst in the car, he kept on telling us if we wanted to stop off anywhere then just say (which we did), he was full of information, just small things which it was nice to be able to ask a local.It was made more than clear at each point that everything was included in the price, there was no pressure at all to tip the different people that we came into contact with, of course we did as it is only polite and the people were wonderful, I thought it was just with noting literally everything is included in the good value cost of the trip!We spent 4 nights in Marrakech and this was the best part of the trip by far! We are already looking to return to Morocco and if we do then we will for sure make another trip with this company.If you have any questions message me."

We left early in the morning and arrived in Tangier by mid-morning. Not having selected a tour guide beforehand, upon our arrival we were greeted by several industrious but questionable people. But then an middle aged man approached us and assisted us navigating our way through customs. He showed us his credentials and we decided to use him as our tour guide. His name is Foad Bssari from Discover Morocco Tours. Foad proceeded to take us on a wonderful all day tour of Tangier. His English is excellent and he was not at all pushy. We had a magnificent, thoroughly enjoyable and easygoing, walking and driving tour for 6 hours or so. Our experience in Tangier wound up being one of the highlights of our entire vacation. We saw local markets, religious and cultural sites, did some sightseeing, a little shopping (where we picked up some amazing, authentic Moroccan spices that we cherished and enjoyed when we returned home), and had delicious coffee (the only thing we were brave enough to drink or eat while we there) at a local coffee shop. I cannot emphasize enough how wonderful Foad was with us. He is a true gentleman and a great ambassador for Tangier. I look forward to returning to Tangier and using him again."

Ouidad (i hope that is how her name is spelt), is an amazing tour guide, her English is brilliant, and she constantly asks if there is anything we need to know. Our group consisted, of myself an my wife, a group of 3 from USA, Ouidad and the driver. The vehicle used was brilliant, enough space for all, and powerful AC!We were picked up on time and then we went off on the tour, seeing the tombs, the palace, the gardens and many other things too.Lunch is provided on the tour, but I would not call it a lunch, its a FEAST, there was enough food to feed a small army, from little tapas plates of pickles, to breads and olives. Then the main course, then the dessert, then fruit, then tea. Simply amazing. Ouidad also took us to several shops that only the Moroccan use, where we got a few bargains, cheaper then the Souks.We cannot thank Rachid enough for this tour and in general for all the help with other things. He arranged to pick us up and take us to a Beautiful Hammam place, all off his back.Thank you Rachid for an amazing tour and for everything else. You are a great credit to your business."

My colleagues from the travel industry recommended Discover Morocco and we booked three trips with them. That was definitely the best decision, as we had a fabulous time with our guide Rachid and our driver Essaleh there. Both were very professional and disposed of a huge knowledge about the country, culture, history and locals and revealed a great sense of humor. Especially the fact that on all three tours it was only the two of us and no big groups was a huge bonus. Our trip to Morocco was my first, but certainly not my last one there... If anyone intended to travel to Morocco, I would definitely advise to book their tours with Discover Morocco, especially if anyone is looking for a tailor made, private tour. Even if there might be other companies which offer their trips for less: I doubt they can offer the same professionalism - Some I kept track on myself and they were noncompetitive by far and even gave wrong information about history and culture."

Rachid and his colleague did everything and beyond to make us comfortable and to show us as much of Morocco as possible. We not only visited the major sights, but also got an insight into the lives of local people, local cuisine and customs. The night in the desert was amazing! Tents were big and comfortable, we even had regular bathrooms, all in the middle of the desert.

We stopped at a Berber house first where Rachid explained the various rooms in the house and talked about the Berber people. We also went on a short camel ride which delighted my daughter.The walk through the valley to the waterfall was amazing. Rachid hired a fantastic guide for us who held our daughter's hand right through every tricky bit and made sure she was completely safe. We asked to turn back at one point, thinking it was getting too much for us, but he assured us that she could do it and she was SO glad she carried on! The views were spectacular and our son is now desperate to come back to Morocco to properly tour the country.Rachid was extremely efficient, from the first email to enquire about prices through picking us up from our riad. It's always a bit nerve wracking booking an unknown guide, but I would highly recommend Rachid. He made both children (and us!) very happy.(I have photos which I will add later!)"

We were fortunate to have Abdul as our driver and Rachid as our guide. The excellence of our tour started from the time we landed. Although we were only due to start our tour on the following day, Rachid arranged for us to be picked up from the airport and he also ensure we were brought to our hotel. He told us what time he would arrive the next morning and also kindly offered his personal contact number just in case we got lost in Marrakesh that afternoon. We started our tour travelling in a comfortable SUV car and I must compliment Abdul on his excellent driving even on the curve roads along the Altas mountains. There is quite a bit of travelling by car throughout this tour to get from one town to another however the end destination is always worth the long journey. Rachid would give small talks along the way while we drove in perfect English. As the tour was private , the start timings each day was flexible and we could ask to stop along the way at scenic places if needed. Off the road, Rachid is happy to share more about the local experience in Morocco - more of the current picture rather than the history which one can easily read off the internet. Hence why the title the Real Morocco as it was interesting to learn about Abdul and Rachid perspective of current issues. They were also always happy to answer any questions we have about the country and its culture. The choice of hotels during the tour were also fantastic - each having its own charm. The highlight of the tour for me had to be driving through the Altas mountains and seeing its majestic views - although slight warning to those who are prone to motion sickness that it might be a difficult ride. The overnight stay in the desert is also a once in a life time experience which I highly recommend. To end of our visit to morocco, Rachid extended his generosity on our last night back in Marrakesh with a home cook tagine meal and freshly brewed mint tea. This was not on the tour outline but an extension of friendliness of our guide. Overall, this is a fantastic tour company to go with if you want to experience the real and amazing morocco. Our group of 4 girls always felt safe on the tour and Abdul and Rachid made it their personal mission to keep us entertain during the long car rides and well feed with good moroccan food. I would highly recommend this tour ! Thank you Discover Morocco!"

We were originally meant to do the one night Zagora desert trip but the roads were impassable due to snow so instead we did a day trip to the Ourika Valley and a day trip to Essaouria. The Ourika Valley trip was amazing - the scenery was beautiful, we got to ride camels, hike to a waterfall, had lunch at a stunning restaurant and visit a Moroccan home. Ismail our guide was fantastic... a really genuinely lovely person! I could not recommend this tour company more highly and we will 100% be going back to Morocco to do a desert tour with them as soon as we can."

I was going to Morocco and a friend recommended me this company for the dessert, and I have to say that is AMAZING in every single way. 1. The tour guide was extremely friendly, spoke spanish, english, french and arab. He made sure we were having fun all the time and had a lot of knowledge. Also, he took us to some great spots on the middle of the road for pictures. 2. The firs night we went to Dades Valley and it was great! We slept at a hotel, very comfortable and food was delicious. 3. Second night we slept at the dessert. Unforgettable experience. We did the camel ride and had a great experience. The Berbers at the camp were super cool, friendly and fun. 4. One thing I love about this company is that the main thing they focus on is that you are having a great time and they care about you. 5. We also spend NYE with them and also they picked us at the airport and everything was GREAT! Do not hesitate to contact them if you are going to Morocco. They would make your experience even better!"

You can be in contact all the time before the tour with its friendly manager Rachid, who can gives all information you need to know. The tour was guided by also friendly guy called Othman and he introduced all interesting places all around Ouarzazate and Dades Valley stoping in nice places for lunch and a good hotel in Gorges de Dades for sleeping. The price was really the cheaper I have found there. No minimum problem and you will envoy all details during the three-days tour to Merzouga."

There are a number of Sahara tour of the same kind available on the internet.and I discovered that many of them actually take the exact same route, activities and even end up in the same camp in Sahara. So the important thing is who you book the tour with. In that sense, we were so lucky we booked with Rachid! He is a very responsible person, always care about his guests, making sure everything goes well for us. We did only Sahara tour with him due to our limited time in Marrakech, but if we had more time to explore, we would definitely have gone for other tours with him too - next time for sure. Totally recommend this tour!"

He then took us on a trip in his 4x4 SUV to the desert which included all meals, overnight camping and the camel ride. We were given lots of interesting information and taken to lots of interesting sites such as an ancient hill town made from mud blocks, an old Foreign Legion fortress, film studios, Argan oil producers and many more besides. I would very strongly recommend Rachid because he was so helpful and supportive. We got far more out of the trip with Rachid's great help. It was excellent value for money as well. Liam"

I bought some shampoo, which I can confirm does amazing things for your hair!! We then travelled on, stopping off at lots of places on the way for photos and then on to Ait Ben Haddou, where a fantastic guide had been arranged for us. The whole place is utterly amazing and well worth the visit. The camel trip into the desert was an interesting one. I am used to riding horses, but this was an entirely different experience. The camp was brilliant. The tents had proper beds and were beautifully decorated on the inside. Dinner was absolutely lovely and the music and dancing very entertaining. Waking to watch sunrise was very special. We were sad to say goodbye to Rachid and the driver, both of which had been really good company over the two days. I would definitely recommend using this company!"

We had an hour long camel trip to the tents and then returned to Marrakech the next day. They were great hosts very friendly, and good with children. We found it really interesting hearing about Morrocan culture and way of life. They also introduced us to some great music. Highly recommended if you are staying in Marrakech to get out of the city and see rural Morocco. Also if you are travelling independently they arrange for a driver to meet you at the airport which makes for a very easy start to the holiday. Nothing was too much trouble and they did their best to make the trip as interesting and comfortable as possible. Also we felt 100% safe - no need to have any concerns about leaving the city. Happy to answer any questions. Thanks again Rachid. Cath, Liam, Dom and Ollie."

We were initially drawn to the tour due to the variety of activities, all within one day, and the reasonable price (I did not come across any other tours like this whilst researching online). From the moment I enquired about the tour, Rachid was incredibly helpful and not only booked us in on the day we had suggested but also arranged to meet us at the airport on our arrival (despite arriving two nights before the date of the tour).

We took a 1 night excursion to the town of Mhamid which is situated south of the Atlas mountains and is the last town before the Algerian border. It was a truly unforgettable experience and I highly recommed Discover Morocco Tours. We paid 4,600 Dirhams (about 460 Euros) for two people in cash because paying by card would have incurred an extra 45 Euros charge from the bank in Morocco. Our only recommendation to Discover Morocco Tours is to try and find a way to reduce the commission as paying by card would have been so much easier and convenient for us. A few days before, we had gone on a terrible excursion with one of the cheaper tour companies to the Ourika valley and completely regretted it. They just wanted us to spend money at many stops and didnt care about our experience. Discover Morocco Day Tours on the other hand, was the opposite! Rachid is very friendly, knowledgeable and keeps his promises. Rachid and his driver picked us up at 7am as promised. The journey through the Atlas mountains is long and heavy going, but his land cruiser is very comfotable and it made the 10 hours (in one day) a lot more bearable. We took many bathrooms stops and the cultural stops were insteresting and there wasn't any pressure to spend money. The scenery on the way to the desert is just stunning.When we arrived in M'hammid (around 5pm) we were greeted by Ismail, one of the Berber guides. We went by camel into the desert and arrived at the berber camp in time for sunset. Needless to say we took many (many!) photos. There was full moon and the peace and light of the desert is something everyone should experience!Ismail served us tea when we were finished with our photo taking and he seemed genuinely interested in talking to us. His helpers cooked us a tasty tangine and the singing began to the beat of the African drum. We had our turn on the drums and didn't do quite as well but it was fun and we had a lovely evening. The boys then took our beds out of the tent and we slept in the open air. Again, magical, romantic.... we loved it! We set the alarm for sunrise (6am) and after taking so many photos of the morning light on the dunes (again, stunning!) we headed back to M'hammid town on our trusty camels and then onto Marrakech by car. We were truly exhuasted on the journey back but Rachid couldn't have been more kind, helpful and attentive. Thank you Rachid for being an honest and accomodating guide. We highly recommend this tour company!"

            "review": "Great trip with Brother Rachid. After deciding on Morocco for our honeymoon, we knew we wanted someone to take us around the city of Marrakech and the countryside of Morocco. Reading the reviews on TripAdvisors, we found nothing but great reviews on Discover Morocco Day Tours and a guide named Rachid. I had emailed many different tour groups in Morocco and Rachid was the first to get back to me. Not only the first time, but ever time we emailed him with any questions, he would get right back to us without hesitation. I found that very comforting in a tour guide. From the day we got there, Rachid was waiting for us at the airport with a sign that had our name on it. He gathered our bags and we were off. From the moment we met him, we knew that we were in good hands. After a brief ride through the city, we arrived at the Souks where our Riad was located. Instead of dropping us off to find our way, Rachid walked us through the labyrinth of Marrakech markets to our hotel. On our walk, we mentioned that we wanted someone to take us through the Souks and he said that he would take care of it. Sure enough, the next morning we had a lovely gentleman named Mohammad waiting for us at our hotel to tour us through the Souks. It was an extra charge for the tour through the souks but well worth it. Mohammad spoke perfect english and was very informative as we toured.The next day, Rachid arrived promptly to our Riad at 7:20am for our Sahara Desert adventure. We jumped in the very clean and comfortable LandCruiser and were off! The journey to the Sahara was a long ride (about 8-10 hours) but the scenery was breathtaking. We drove over mountains that could rival the Colorado Rockies and next to cliffs that resembled the Grand Canyon. We stopped plenty of times for bathroom breaks and places that Rachid thought we would find interesting. We also stopped for a delicious lunch that was included in our package. Finally we arrived at the Sahara Desert (make sure you have plenty of water!) and our next mode of transportation, camels! Rachid and the driver let us out and we were then led by the Berber people on camel back to our camp site. Rachid and the driver drove themselves and all of our luggage in the car to the campsite. That was very nice because our other camp mates had to carry their own. The camel ride was about one hour through scrub and up and down sand dunes. It was beautiful and so much fun.After a lovely night sleeping under the stars (we pulled the beds out of the tent), we had an early start back in the car with Rachid and the driver. We skipped the camel ride back to the town and just got back in the car. Rachid had even more points of interest to show us on the drive back. We stopped at Ait Ben Addouh and took a great tour of the Kasbah, dozed off and on in the car and before your knew it, we were back in Marrakech. Rachid dropped us off at our next hotel, we said our goodbyes. It was hard to part ways after such a great couple of days! There is nothing better than taking a shower after a night in the desert. Once we had rinsed off at the hotel, we had to begin to make plans to get to the airport a couple days later. Our hotel was going to charge us 30 Euros for 5 minute ride to the airport. Obviously we did not want to pay that so I emailed Rachid to ask him what we should pay a taxi driver to get to the airport. Of course he got right back to us and said that he would send a driver and not to worry about what it costs. It was such a kind gesture to take of us like that. We did tip the driver but it did not seem necessary.All in all, Rachid literally was like a guardian watching over us the whole time we were in Morocco. He treated us like family. Even though we always felt safe, it was nice to have Brother Rachid looking out for us in such a foreign country. He said that once you do a trip to the desert, you are now family and that is why he will always be Brother Rachid to us. We highly recommend booking any tour with Rachid. He will exceed your expectations and made our trip to Morocco an incredible, once in a lifetime experience!"

As 4 females, we felt safe and confident walking around the Souks, seeing the day come to life - most fascinating. We also took in the Majorelle Gardens (Yves San Laurent's), a much welcome oasis amongst the heat and speed of pace in the Medina. Our second day, was a trip out through the Atlas Mountains to Ait benhaddou. With Rachid as our guide, we were well looked after with plenty of water, photography stops and local information (and much laughter!)

We met some people in our Riad who had booked this tour (two nights and a camel trek into the Sahara), and the day before they were set to leave, I phoned Rachid and asked him if we could come along. They managed to fit us in with no trouble whatsoever, much to our delight! Our guide for the trip was actually Kamal who was absolutely brilliant. As other people have said, nothing was too much trouble and we were able to stop whenever and wherever we wanted to. During our trip we stopped at a Kasbah which we were guided around (for an extra 15 dirham, I think). It was actually a very interesting visit with panoramic views of the surrounding landscape and a beautiful little town to look and shop around. After our visit to the Kasbah we went to a restaurant and were able to have a swim in the pool - a very needed cool off. Later that day we visited the Dades Gorge where we stayed the night in a nice hotel that was very welcome after a long day's drive. We had tagine for dinner and were then seranaded by a group of drummers which was really fun! The next day we drove down to the Sahara and, after our drive, went for a swim in a hotel swimming pool before our trek into the desert. We got onto camels and trekked into the desert where we stayed in a very authentic camp (although thankfully it had beds!). Overall we had a fantastic experience and, as one of the cheapest tours offered around Marrakech, it was certainly worth the money we paid for it. Kamal was the perfect guide and although he drove us over 400 miles, remained 100% happy and helpful. He also navigated the bends of the Atlas mountains expertly! I would definitely recommend this tour company and would use them again if I were to return to Morocco. Thanks Kamal and Rachid from Rachel and Zanny"

Our guide, Kamal was extremely helpful, happy and friendly. He also turned out to be a pretty good driver as he navigated his way around lorries on the mountain roads and kept us all safe in the car! We travelled in a 4x4 as there were only 6 of us on the trip which also meant that we could drive across a river and up to a few view points to get some good photos. The Riad was also good. The only thing I could say that was bad about it was that we had no hot water in our room but the staff were very friendly and we were serenaded after dinner by some Berber boys playing the drums. We then travelled towards the desert and got to have a swim in a pool before getting on our camels to ride into the desert at sunset. The Berber camp that we went to was great: friendly men and a fun camel ride with great pictures. We also had a good tagine and couscous dinner. We then travelled back to Marrakech the next day which was a long drive (10ish hours) but Kamal stopped enough times along the way to have breaks etc. I would recommend this tour to anyone and after doing some research into it, it looks like it's a pretty good price (120\u20ac) each. Kamal was a great guide and the company was very trustworthy. We had a great time and it really made our trip to morocco a bit more special."

            "review": "Marrakech & Merzouga Desert. This was our first visit to Morocco and Discover Morocco Tours made it such a memorable trip. We had only a few days and wanted to see as much as possible. Rachid put together an itinerary and made sure that every last detail was taken care of for us. MARRAKECH:We flew into Marrakech and Rachid was at the airport waiting with transportation to our riad (primary form of accommodation: equivalent to a b&b or guest house). We stayed in the heart of the medina (which was amazing) but vehicles can only take you so far. When we reached the gates Rachid had arranged for someone to meet us with a hand-pulled cart for our luggage. We were very grateful for this as it was still a good 10 minute walk through the narrow busy streets/alleyways of the medina to reach our riad. He gave us a little time to settle into our accommodation then arranged for an orientation city tour of Marrakech with a local guide who specialized in Marrakech walking tours. This was a good way to start the trip. We were able to see the different areas of the city, visit the palace, learn some history, see some of the local handcrafts in progress and shop in the market. If we hadn't taken this tour we would most likely not have ventured outside the medina on our own so it was great to see a little more of the city. Our time in Marrakech was amazing but the primary reason we chose Discover Morocco Tours was to see more of Morocco and visit the desert. Rachid met us at our riad early in the morning and off we went on our road trip! He had arranged a driver with a spacious van. We left Marrakech and began our adventure over the Atlas mountains into the desert.ROAD TRIP ACROSS MOROCCO:We chose the Merzouga desert trip because of the red sand. This was the Sahara we had always pictured. The Merzouga desert is almost twice the distance from Marrakech compared to the Zagora desert (the other option with white sand / smaller dunes). So the itinerary we were interested in is usually a long excursion. That said, we only had a few days in Morocco. Rachid was amazing and worked with us to put together an excursion that would allow us to visit Merzouga in our timeframe and budget. The downside would be a lot of traveling in a short time (hundreds of miles in a matter of days) but we were prepared to deal with that and Rachid did his best to break it up for us. Considering how far we had to go we still saw so much! It's incredible how different the mountains, villages and deserts are from the Morocco we experienced in Marrakech. The stops that Rachid chose gave an incredible taste of the country. It was a really good balance of known attractions and \"real Morocco\". At most of the stops Rachid accompanied us as the guide but for some sites he arranged a local guide to take us around. These local guides rely on tour companies to bring visitors to see their villages so we were happy to learn from the locals.DESERT CAMPING:It took two days to get to the red desert. Rachid arranged accommodation at a hotel just outside the Dades Gorges for us the first night (which was excellent). When we reached Merzouga the next day we established base at a desert hotel. The camels and desert camping excursions are all associated with hotels just outside the dunes so that there is a place for the drivers to stay while visitors are in the desert. This arrangement also permits visitors to lock up their belongings and allows use of the facilities (showers) when visitors return which we were very grateful for. Merzouga is actually the name of the town where these hotels that offer desert excursions are located. The dunes themselves are called Erg Chebbi. The desert was worth every second spent on the road to get there. We were met at the hotel by one of the Berbers from the camp. He had a camel for each of us and led us over the dunes into the Sahara. About an hour into the camel trek we stopped to watch the sunset. We were already deep enough into the desert that nothing but dunes could be seen whichever direction you looked and the sun hitting the red sand is like nothing I could ever describe. I can't imagine anything in our lifetime will compare to the half hour spent on top of that dune. Ever.When we were ready we continued our trek into the desert. It was another hour before we reached camp but when you are on a camel trek in the Sahara you take in every minute. The sky was so clear that the moon and the stars provided plenty of light. In fact when we reached camp we spent the first half hour laying in the dunes watching shooting stars.Dinner was delicious. Typical Moroccan tagine: bread, meat, potatoes and vegetables with fruit for dessert. After dinner a campfire was built. There were five other groups from all over staying at the camp so we all tried to introduce ourselves. Then the berber men joined the campfire and performed traditional berber music for about an hour. They got us up dancing and even passed their instruments around for everyone to try. It was fantastic.We did not know what to expect from the camping experience but it was very enjoyable. Sleeping tents were all together and faced inward to a communal area. We had our own tent complete with cots dressed in blankets and pillows. Dinner was served in a large tent at the front of camp decorated in beautiful moroccan textiles with tables and chairs. And there were outhouse-style toilets just outside the tents. It definitely exceeded our expectations.On the morning we left our camels were waiting for us outside of camp. I will admit that this second camel ride was felt far more than our first. Despite the padding from the blankets on the harness, riding camels will leave it's mark on your inner thighs. But despite a little discomfort the views of the Sahara were no less spectacular on the way out.Because of our limited timeframe we had to head directly back to Marrakech from Merzouga. It was a long drive (12+hrs) but the views along the way were incredible. When we arrived Rachid walked with us to our riad, making sure we found it in the dark. The following morning he met us for breakfast where we marked our travels on a map bought in the market and he arranged transport back to the airport in time for our flight. Rachid walked with us all the way to the check-in desk. By this time we were saying goodbye to a friend, not just our guide. You will not get an experience like this with any old tour company.If we are fortunate enough to return to Morocco in the near future we wouldn't think twice before booking with Discover Morocco Tours again. We had such a fantastic experience. Thank you Rachid!!!"

I can quite easily say it was the best part of our time in Morocco. We were picked up by Kamal who was our host for the two days. Kamal was a fantastic tour guide. He was easy going, had a great sense of humour and always made sure we were comfortable. We stopped at a number of different places to explore and take photos. He was very knowledgeable and was happy to answer any questions we had. I would highly recommend Kamal to anyone thinking about doing a tour with Discover Morocco Tours. If you have 4-5 days in Marrakesh, this tour is perfect. We were joined by another couple from Britain which we got on with very well. The landscape on the way to Zagoura is truly breathtaking and the people were friendly wherever we went. We eventually reached Zagoura and were picked by the Berbers who provided the camel ride and night in the desert. We stayed in the Berber camp and had a great time. The dinner, atmosphere and morning sunsets were all fantastic. The next day Kamal picked us up and we commenced the journey back to Marrakesh.Many thanks to Kamal and the team. You guys provided a memorable experience.Shane and NicolaSydney, Australia"

We then hiked for an hour and a half in Ourkia valley to a wonderful waterfall (this was tough work in the heat but well worth it!). The day finished with a great lunch by the river. Our driver and tour guide were very kind and helpful - they also played some great music on the drive between stops! We very much enjoyed the day and highly recommend this tour company."

I went to Marrakech with 2 friends, at first we weren't sure if we wanted to visit the desert, partly because the drive was so long and many of the tours were really expensive. Luckily my friend found out about Discover Morocco Tours. We booked through email and Rachid was really patient and informative to respond to all our questions. They even arranged a driver to pick us up at the airport. The 2 day trip to Zagoura Desert was definitely the best part of our trip. We stop every hour or so to take pictures of the gorgeous scenery and to stretch our legs. We even visited the Berber villages where many movies were shot. This made the 8 hr drive pass by in a blink. When we arrived at the desert we rode camels to the camp which was another exciting experience. We were expecting to have to sleep in sleeping bags in the tent, but the camp was a lot better than what we were expecting with electricity and actual beds! Looking at the stars in the middle of the desert was another unforgettable experience. We woke up early to see the sunrise in the desert the next morning and they served nice coffee, mint tea and bread for breakfast. The drive back to Marrakech was comfortable with the friendly driver and Rachid who is very genuine, helpful and made us feel very welcomed. I would definitely recommend Discover Morocco tours and hope to go back and see more of Morocco!"

The Trip started with Rachid (our host) and Abdul (our driver) coming to our Riad (Matham) to pick us up, so we wouldn't get lost trying to find them. The kindness didn't stop there, throughout the two days with Rachid and Abdul both went out of their way to make our trip great even when they didn't have to. From little gestures such as buying us Moroccan sweets we had never tried before, to bigger such as secretly getting a birthday cake for my dads birthday with his name written on it - and getting the whole camp to sing happy birthday. He was touched by Rachid's kindness and I was grateful for the gesture. As for the trip itself, we made lots of stops at interesting places which I won't go into, but as a photographer, they were all awesome.We took a camel ride (my first experience of this) through the Zogora desert at sunset which was beautiful, then stayed over night in a tent which was a massive surprise - It wasn't cold, wasn't cover in desert bugs, and was actually quite comfortable. Food was also provided at night and in the morning. Was a lot of fun!I recommend this to anyone, even people who aren't so 'outdoorsy'. Thanks Rachid for a great trip."

I have just returned from a week long trip to Marrakech for my honeymoon with my wife and chose discover Morocco tours after wading through various options on trip advisor. I wasn't disappointed. I was in contact with Rachid before the honeymoon and he was extremely helpful and patient in asking my numerous questions (I wanted to get it right!) and so that filled me with confidence before getting out there. We chose the 2 day trips to the Ozud waterfalls and the 3 valleys and they were really worth it, we both thoroughly enjoyed the trips and gave us a good flavour of Morocco life. What particularly struck us about Rachid and our driver Abdul was how professional and knowledgeable they were but also so down to earth, friendly and good fun they were too, and they seemed to get the balance perfectly. We liked how they were leaving us to chat and be by ourselves for a lot of the time too - they weren't in our faces all the time, like I guess some tour guides might be, and we appreciated that. Rachid was flexible too when we decided to change one of our trips and we thought this might be a problem but he was fine with it. What was also good was how it really felt like we were incontrol and he accommodated us so well - from giving us a chance to stop and take pics etc whenever we wanted to picking us up bang on time at our Riad and giving us lots of helpful info about life in Marrakech. 2 things that also impressed me about this compared with other options were that Rachid picked us up and took us back to the airport as part of the package, and the money for the day trips was for everything - lunch and drinks included, so we didn't have to worry about anything.All in all a brilliant time with Rachid and Abdul who felt more like friends than guides by the end of the week. We are keen to return one day."

The following morning Amanar took us on our overnight trip to the desert and we had a great time, he went above and beyond, he has a great sense of humour and was very knowledgeable. On the 2nd day he found us a donkey to have pictures with as I had mentioned it the day before. We stopped at many stalls/shops on the way through the mountains and he was patient whilst us girls shopped! Finally both Amanar and Rachid met us on our last day to get us back to the airport.

Rachid answered very promptly and was more than willing to tailor the trip to our needs. I booked two trips (12th/13th Feb 2014). One was a day tour around Marrakech and the main attractions and souks. This was by a local guide and not Rachid. This really gave me and my husband a real life in sight into the medina. This was a trip by foot and we saw many famous sights and also went deep into hidden souks. On the second day we had arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains/three valleys. The day started at 7.50am. We were with Rachid and his friend Abdul. We travelled first to have camel ride. We then went to eat breakfast in a Berber house where we were really looked after and had fresh home made traditional food. We then stopped at various places on our journey to see beautiful picturesque views. The next stop was a mountain bike ride. Me and my husband have never laughed so much. We are slim but unfit and in our late 20's and attempting to do a mountain bike ride! Although physically difficult for us (we also wore jeans and it was really hot!) the views and experience was incredible. After this we needed some much needed lunch! Rachid and Abdul treated us to some traditional street food which was gorgeous - think of a spiced barbecued burger. The day did not end here. We then went on to finish the day quad biking! This was fantastic. The views were stunning and Rachid really knew the best spots! We were back to our hotel by 5.15pm despite such a busy day.Throughout the day Rachid and Abdul were always joking with us and answered any questions. We spoke about the Moroccan culture, politics and religion. No question was left unanswered. They were open minded and like they both said they treat you like family! Would definitely recommend Rachid and his company. I will never forget these memories!"

We can stop whenever we want; we are the king! In addition Rachid would be very happy to take our picture. The hotels provided during the tour were top class. We couldnt ask for more!I would very much recommend Rachid as your guide when you have the chance to visit Marocco. Thanks Rachid! I would really love to visit Marocco again."

Call into a Berber house on the way for mint tea, fresh baked bread and local honey.And then a camel ride. Definitely worth it although I warn you the hike/climb up is not for faint hearts or those who are totally unfit. Wear suitable footwear. There is in fact an easier way which you come down by. Our guide Rachid was a pleasure to meet and helped make it a great day out."

He was there to pick us up in front of our riad, right on time. He was very friendly and had a good sense of humor. The tour was just what we needed for a nice get-away from Marrakech.

I also felt that his rates were quite competitive. Go for it!! Have a blast!"

Rachid and the driver picked us up at our hotel at the exact time he said he would, and drove us about an hour outside of Marrakech and showed us a great day. We did so many different things (ride camel, hike to waterfalls, eat traditional food, dress in traditional garb) which made the trip exciting. I would absolutely recommend him, he was a lot of fun, very honest and very kind. He even bought the two of us bracelets on his own!"

We booked two tours with him and were not disappointed. He accompanied us on both. The first tour was to Ait Ben-Haddou with another couple. It was a long day but worth it. We had an off-road adventure and were able to stop wherever we asked. Breakfast and lunch were included and well-worth it. Best tour meals I've ever had. The second trip was to the Ourika Valley, a lovely place. This time we were with three other people, so the tour was extremely personal. Again, breakfast and lunch included. Rachid is a wonderful host. The tour is well worth the money and his prices are extremely competitive. We have made a friend for life!"

Rachid out-sourced this, and we got the impression he is trying to find the right guides for this particular tour to meet his high standards. Our guide was ok - not bad, but certainly not great... The tour finishes early afternoon. The second tour was the Ait benhaddou/Ouarzazate/Atlas mountain trip. A long day from 8am to 9pm, but what a day. Rachid and his outstanding driver took us not only to the highlights of this special tour, but also took time to do some extras (taking a more scenic route there, doing a great 4x4 \"race\" across the desert towards Ouarzazate, etc.). I would HIGHLY recommend this day out with Rachid. The 3rd tour was the Ourika Valley trip, which was pretty good, particularly the last climb from the first waterfall up. Overall we really like Rachid. He is clearly proud of his tradition and country, and we got a small taste of this beautiful place with his warm hospitality and engaging character! I regret not doing a 2 day trip into the desert with him - other reviews seem to be raving about that too!"

The trip was amazing, we went through Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah, Ouarzazate, Todgha to the Todra Gorge, Tinjdad and finally to Merzouga. The landscape changed every 20 minuten, and so did the colors. The hotel was good, and the nomad camp was even better. Great camel ride watching the sunset and sunrise, lovely food, nice berber music and the sky full of stars was amazing! The last day Rachid joined us and guided us back to Marrakech. He was great company, and offered to help us at any time, apart from the desert trip. We really felt comfortable with this tour agency and its guides, they really love their work and know a lot about the Morrocan culture and sites. We would definitely book this tour or another tour at this agency again!"

I had seen some very good reviews of Rachid on the internet and I was not disappointed to have booked with him!! He took my girlfriend and me on an excursion to Ait Benhaddou and made it the experience of a lifetime!Rachid is very knowledgeable, friendly and funny! From the start of the day until we returned to Marrakech, he made it a fun, exciting and interesting day. He gave us lots of information about the Berber culture, Moroccan history and the sights we were seeing; he answered all of our questions and was an endless source of knowledge.We stopped at many places on our journey through the Atlas mountains: for a Berber breakfast (which was included in the price of the tour), to see some amazing and interesting settlements and views, at a place where they made argan oil (a lady there gave us a short tour and explained how they produced the various oils used for cosmetics and eating), to stop for coffee breaks, and at a number of Berber stalls selling souvenirs and the likes.The driver was very safe and experienced but managed to take make the journey quick and pleasant. His car was very comfortable with air conditioning; Rachid chatted with us throughout the journey and even played Berber music for us on the car stereo!When we reached Ait Benhaddou we stopped for a delicious lunch (also included) and enjoyed views of the Kasbah before proceeding to see it up close. Rachid showed me how to tie a Berber style turban (I think it is called a Shesh or Chan) which helped protect me from the bright sun. He let us take our time and stop to look at things that we took interest in, he never rushed us.I cannot explain what a great man Rachid is, he is very down to earth and has an amazing outlook on life! He told us of some of his life experiences, some of which are very moving. He is a Berber himself and knew most of the people we met along our journey. He explained that some guides are in cahoots with the traders and will take tourists to places that overcharge you and give commission back to the guide. He doesn't take any commission from any of the traders and even told us which places were overcharging customers and not to buy anything from them.If you get a chance to take an excursion with Rachid then you simply must do it! You will not regret it!! If I am able to go back in Marrakech again then I will definitely go on an excursion to the dessert with Rachid as I would love to spend a night or two trekking through the dunes and seeing the stars!Thank you Rachid, this was the highlight of our holiday!"

We booked this trip with complete ease - we contacted Rachid the evening before the trip and had a reply within hours confirming that we would be able to travel the next day, which we didnt expect. We initially chose Rachid due to the great price that was offered, and we weren't disappointed. We were picked up from our Riad on time by our friendly, English-speaking guide and taken to Rachid's comfortable mini-van with seatbelts and air conditioning. We then proceeded to drive out of Marrakech with our guide explaining a few things about the Berbers and Morocco. He was polite and friendly and Rachid drives very well and is very careful. The hour and a half journey is split well, meaning we weren't in the minivan for the full time before we were seeing our attractions.Our first stop consisted of visiting a traditional Berber family home, where we were provided with a tour as well as a delicious breakfast made by the family themselves. Although there were other tourists there, it did not seem overcrowded or make much of a difference. The people and the sights from the house were wonderful.Following our stop here, we continued ahead to our camel ride, which was a little shorter than stated on the website, but not by much. We were still pleased with the amount of riding we got to do, with beautiful views either side. We also stopped at a small place where Argan Oil is produced and sold, with an English speaking lady who provided all the information we needed.Our final stop was in the Ourika Valley itself, where we walked to the waterfalls. It was quite a journey, which took around 50 minutes each way but the sights were excellent and we felt well looked after by our guide who was friendly and chatty throughout. We seemed to pass the touristy waterfall and headed to another one which was more secluded and private, which was great. After we had walked back down we were provided with a delicious free three course lunch, where we only had to pay for our own drinks and a tip.This concluded our trip and we were escorted back to our Riad by Rachid and our guide. The drive back was pleasant and a well deserved sit down!"

Rachid always delivered what he promised.My two kids got on with him great."

It was an amazing trip where we got in touch with the Berber culture: living in the desert and in the Atlas mountains. A minibus brought us to several places where we could enjoy the view, taste the local food and learn about the culture. We were accompanied by a sympathetic guide (Rachid), who showed us the most beautiful places and entertained us with his humor and open-minded view. We did a long distance, but that didn\u2019t really bother because we stopped so much. We\u2019ve also seen Ouerazate, a Kasbah town were the gladiator (and many more) was filmed. The most exciting part of the journey was the camel ride through the Sahara and the feast afterwards in the Berber camp. We ate traditional food and we danced the camel dance under the moonlight.It was an amazing experience, that I would surely recomand!The price is fair and all-included (food, sleeping place, camel ride, transportation\u2026)We did this during ramadan and this was not a problem."

The price is more than fair and Rachid doesn't waste your time taking you to nonsense places to make commission. He's an honest and genuine guy, as is his driver. Wicked tour and an awesome time.

Had the chance to visit a Berber family and was treated to traditional breakfast (all the meals included in the price!) and got to see how Moroccan mint tea is prepared and served. Got to ride camels too and visited an institute where Moroccan oil and other natural remedies are being made. The height of the day was however the hike up the mountains to see the waterfalls. It was cool in the mountains and the scenery was extremely beautiful. It wasn't an entirely easy hike but our guide made sure that everyone safely made it up to the waterfalls. Really recommend this day trip! A memorable experience and a great way to either have fun with friends or make new ones!"

It was hands-down our best decision during our entire stay in Marrakesh. During our trip we visited the Merzouga Desert and had an amazing sunset camel ride through the red sands and giant dunes. We got to stay with a berber camp and look at the stars, which are simply stunning in the Sahara Desert. Our trip was lead by the owner of the company Rachid, and he was an amazing guide. In my previous trip to Morocco (a couple of years back) my guide simply pointed out landscapes without much explanation but during this trip we were very lucky to have Rachid, who is very knowledgeable and made an effort to tell us about the history and culture of the places we were visiting. Rachid made everything in our trip run smoothly and he even made a point to help us with other logistics of our trip after the excursion was over. Rachid and Discover Morocco helped make our trip a wonderful and memorable experience and I recommend Discover Morocco to anyone planning a trip to Marrakesh. I also recommend taking time to visit the Merzouga Desert which is the desert you see in photographs of the Sahara (orange sand, large sand dunes). During my previous trip I visited the Zagoura Desert which was still a great trip though not quite as gorgeous and memorable as the Merzouga. Thanks so much Rachid for an amazing trip and experience!! -Ana from California"

We found Rachid to be warm, friendly, easy to talk too and very responsive to our emails and questions; plus he and his assistants were punctual (which clients always appreciate). He was flexible enough to work with us so as to deviate a bit from the norm and include a trip to an authentic Berber market - which we found facinating. Unfortuanlty, Rachid could not be with us all day but his partner was just a professional and knowlegable. All-in-all a great day.

I did the 3 day, 2 night excursion to the Merzouga Desert (has beautiful red sand, large dunes) and it's for sure one of the best trips I've ever been on. There was suppose to be another group joining the tour but they cancelled last minute and instead of cancelling the tour altogether, our guide Rachid still did it (for the same price) but with just me and my two friends. He always went out of his way to accommodate our needs and made sure we were always comfortable throughout our trip. Rachid, along with the driver who were both very considerate and always had our best interest at heart, made us feel more like family than just another regular tour group. Rachid was very knowledgeable in Berber culture and Morocco's history, and we were able to see everything from the Kasbah to the gorges and the Atlas Mountains. The camel ride to the Merzouga desert was incredible, you start right before sunset (and get to stop while the sun's setting to take some epic photos) and the return ride is right before sunrise. We had a hilarious nomad guide that led our camels to the campsite and when we arrived we were served a nice traditional dinner along with live music and dancing. On the way back we were able to shower and change at a hotel so the overall trip is well thought out and very accommodating. Rachid is hands down the best guide you could ask for, so I strongly recommend this tour (he is the owner) as well as doing the 3 day, 2 night excursion to get to the Merzouga Desert (it's worth the extra day!!) This is definitely going down as one of my most memorable experiences. Thanks Rachid!! -Natasha, USA"

Firstly we would like to thank Rachid and his colleague, a very responsible and smart driver, for everything they did on the trip.Before coming to Marrakech, we contacted like 20 different travel agencies with the same quote: 3 days, 2 nights in Merzouga (Erg Chebbi sand dunes). Rachid (Discover Morocco Tours) gave us an offer we couldn't resist: the price was really good, the tour was private (for 4 people), we didn't have to worry about anything apart from memorizing all that interesting information our guide was giving us. I have to point out the fact that everything was included in the price (a night in a hotel, three meals per day, a camel ride, night in a tent in nomad's camp). Because most agencies only include one or two meals. You can get a better price from other tour agencies if you join a shared tour with many people. But in this case you will not get a guide (only a driver) and no freedom at all. And we could freely ask to stop and have a short break in some scenic areas on the way to the desert, we could ask about anything and Rachid would answer as he's very knowledgeable and attentive.Thank you and hope to meet you again!Lithuanians:)"

Beside the wonderful experience in a Berber House( breakfast) beside of the views and the camel ride, the guide , Rishard Amallah was very freindly all the time. He was a very good representative of his country, not only teach us everything about his culture but also helping us even to bargain!All the guys I meet that day became my friends and we discovered Marrakesh together the following days. So that was one of the most interesting tour I have done there. The meal was wonderful as well Really worthy!!! thanks for making those days in Marroco really amazing..Hugs from BRAZIL"

Everything was beautiful and exciting, but the thing we loved the most was the journey to the waterfalls with Rachid and his driver. We really enjoyed the tour, the taxi was clean, Rachid was smart and helpful and show us what it means to be a berber, free people, in 21th century. It means to be passionate, have a strong ethic and be honest with tourists, and help them to understand what are the real things to do in Morocco. He's like a friend, he doesn't take you to useless shops, we smiled a lot. Great experience!!"

We emailed 2 days before going and Rachid gave us 2 quotes, one to go with a group and one to go by ourselves. We went with the group and Rachid was the best value of 4 other quotes apart from one which we didn't trust. He came to the hotel the next morning to discuss what we wanted to do and we wanted to stay in a Berber tent, ride camels (still got camel bum) and visit Ait Ben Haidou.Rachid looked after us very well. He has had experience managing a hotel and it shows because he is very professional. He has been brought up on a strong set of Berber ethics and seems to be reluctant to charge for his service! He is a good tour guide as well with previous agency experience and being brought up in the mountains he knows his stuff. His English is good but a little hard to understand at first. Rachid will quickly become your friend rather than a guide. I am particularly grateful for him getting my bag back after leaving it on the wrong bus!Other tour guides will take you to shops where you will be pressured to buy stuff but Rachid isn't interested in commission. Instead he uses his network to get you the best price. All the restaurants or cafes were good quality and Rachid will pay for it for you which makes things a lot easier. He is quick to buy you drinks even if you don't really want one! But it is all included. The best value though is Rachids time. Despite paying group price, Rachid was our private guide, we only piggybacked another vehicle to keep costs down."

Right away, Rachid calmed our worries about the hectic and unfamiliar city, and sat down with us to show us on a map where we were and how to get to key attractions such as Djemaa el Fna and the souks. He even lent us his cell phone so that we could call for help if we got lost! That really impressed us, since he showed such great trust and hospitality before even getting to know us. Later on in the trip, my fiance got kind of sick (probably from some bad food at the food stalls). My fiance didn't feel up to trying to find food ourselves while he was sick, and we didn't have a lot of money, so we talked to Rachid and Rachid took us to a reliable, clean little local restaurant (not catering to tourists). Rachid helped us order and buy some roast chicken with bread and veggies. Nothing fancy, but very solid and we knew we could trust its cleanliness and quality because of Rachid. Overall, Rachid is extremely friendly, personable, considerate, knowledgeable, and helpful for anything you might need. He speaks good English, and you will not regret taking a tour with him. You will feel like you've made a great friend in Morocco--one you'll want to hang on to. I highly recommend his services."

For the rest of the time I had no time getting around the city and the surrounding area. Rachid knows so many people and places and has such a loving family, that you will feel like you belong in Morocco! Traveling around Morocco can be a bit daunting, but Rachid, with such a kind heart and open arms, can make anyone's trip wonderful. It helps to have his knowledge of the Atlas mountains, Marrakech and Morocco to feel like you've really seen Morocco, really gotten a feeling for its people and culture. I recommend taking a tour with him if you visiting Morocco. It will be the highlight of your trip.\u0634\u0643\u0631 Rachid"

Rishard set up and took me and 2 friends on this awesome trip to check out waterfalls and some of the beautiful wilderness in the interior of morocco. We had a private car pick us up at the hotel and drive us a couple hours. Just the car ride alone was great since Rishard is the man and made the trip feel like 2 minutes. Hes the nicest guy. After we did some hiking and saw the waterfalls, we had a beautiful authentic moroccan tajin lunch with monkeys running around the all-outdoors restaurant and the waterfalls as our view. This could have been the highlight of the trip since we were all just chilling enjoying the food, friends, and scenery. Life doesnt get better. Anyways, we did some more hiking and sight seeing and loved it all. We also took a 30 minute rafting adventure down one of the rivers which was chill. Overall, i'd recommend doing this trip again, but make sure you do it with Rishard. He made the trip go smoothly & memorably."

We had some frequent stops but he stopped at resting areas with either great food or views. After a whole day of driving, we finally arrived at the camel site. We got to choose and name our camels (mine was Momo). Even though we had to trek through a sandstorm, Adil saved us all with his excellent navigation skills. We arrived at the campsite to some amazing tagine chicken for dinner. After the storm passed, the sky cleared up which was the perfect time for us to stargaze. We had a lot of fun with singing and playing their drums.What I loved the most about this trip was our tour guide. Adil was relatable to us as we all were in the same age group (we've all attended college). We've played games, shared a ton of stories traveling and even shared our most embarrassing moments. We also had a lot of questions about Morocco which he was always happy to answer. Secondly, the tagine chicken skewers were my favorite meal in any restaurant we stopped at. It's flavorful and fulfilling.Since this is a two-day trip and you're staying in for 1 night, I would recommend packing some basic hygiene (toothbrush, soap, and shampoo) as they do have a bathroom with toilets and showers. Pack in some light cotton pajamas if you're going there during the summer. Additionally, wear light cotton clothing that covers you so that you don't get sunburn on your arms and legs. If a sandstorm ever hits you, make sure you bring something to cover your head and eyes! Also, I would recommend wearing close-toed shoes since the sand is hot as well."

Everyone is there to help personalise your tour and make it memorable from the Top Desert crew to the Hotel in the Dades gorge, the places they stop for food especially the Ksar Timney because that is exactly what they did for us. The transport is luxurious and air conditioning amazing even on a 38 degree day. Mubarack is the safest driver. We felt we were in great hands from our pick up till drop off. During this time we had gone from driver and guide to friend. He was always smiling and happy. During the trip we never felt rushed and he gauged our interests such as fossils and geography so took us to places that were of interest to us. Between the four of us we can not say one thing was our favourite as so many things were. Up there in the list is the camel ride to and from the desert, the Kasbah, the fossil visit and seeing the huge diversity in scenery as you travel through MoroccoOverall we wish to thank Mubarack for making our trip full of memories and we hope to be back one day."

We did the 3 day 2 night private Luxury Desert Tour from Marrakech to Fez. Our tour guide Abdou was wonderful. From the moment he picked us up he made us feel so comfortable and we bonded straight away. He was funny, kind and told us many interesting stories. He picked us up in a 4x4 brand new clean and very spacious car with air-conditioning which made every hour of the journey in the car comfortable. On our way to the desert we made many stops at gorges, small towns and beautiful valleys. Abdou knew how much we loved animals and the little stalls on the roadside and always stopped and showed us things he knew we would enjoy. The desert itself was the most incredible thing I have ever experienced. Seeing the sand dunes for the first time really is completely breathtaking! The luxury camp was everything I pictured plus more. The whole set up was beautiful, our rooms were spacious and having a private toilet and shower was great. Everyone involved was so friendly and the food was the best we had in Morocco.Our whole experience with Top Desert was faultless. They are professional, flexible, always prompt in replying to emails and most of all they care about what their customers want and go above and beyond to make the experience memorable.Abdou, thank you so much for being our guide in this tour. Kind-hearted, gracious and humorous - You are one of a kind!! We will miss our sing-alongs in the car with you and we cannot wait to come back to Morocco to visit you one day or for you to come to Australia! :) Grace & Brendan"

            "review": "Comfort and serenity in an exotic location. From the start, my experience with Top Desert inspired confidence and ease. Moha, the Top Desert agent, was able to tailor a trip to our needs even though most of the packages are three days or more and we only had two days. Our tour guides, Brahmin and Rashid, picked us up in a brand new and comfortable Toyota Land Cruiser and drove us twelve hours through the Atlas Mountains and the desert ( no roads in the desert, just riding across the sand). They stopped often at interesting spots, and even planned a nomad's picnic lunch. The scenery is beautiful and our conversation was so delightful that getting to know these two men was as much a highlight as the desert. As a young child, Rashid grew up in the desert, and his family has been nomads for generations, so the desert is his pride and home. Brahim is an extraordinary driver negotiating the mountain driving with ease and somehow never getting tired. We felt totally safe with him at the wheel. When we were an hour from camp, we were met by camel's and rode the last hour through the Sahara on camel. It sounds like a touristy thing to do, but really riding through the endless waves of sand dunes on the back of my calm camel in the total silence was a powerful and profound experience. I glanced over and there was Rashid, walking along like a desert prince back in his home. The tent camp is definitely glamming, with a comfortable bed, toilet and shower. We just happened to be the only people in the camp that night, so we had four or five friendly and polite men attentive to our every need and it was almost embarrassing to be that indulged. We sat in front of our tent as the sun went down, chatting with Brahim and Rashid, and it felt as if we were with friends. We were served a huge portion of lamb tagine and couscous for dinner. We arose early to watch the sunrise over the dunes, and after breakfast, we started the twelve hour ride back with lovely stops, and at the end, I was sad to say goodbye to my new friends. I highly recommend this experience to see an essential part of Morocco."

We selected to take the two day trip through Draa valley, the berber villages and stayed in Erg Lihoudi dunes.The experience was truly something we will remember for a lifetime. The Draa valley and the drive to the Berber villages through the Atlas mountains was mesmerising. The whole nomad camp experience, sunrise and sunset in the dunes was stunning!All the people involved, from driver, tour assistant, the people running the camp and the camel owner was perfect.the only feedback (not negative) we need to give is the rushed driving to the dunes - which made us a bit nauseated but it makes sense as we merely made the sunset by 30 mins.Thanks u all"

It began with a very easy-to-use website and very clear communication before arriving in Morocco. They contacted our Riad before we arrived in Marrakech to ensure someone would be available when they came to pick us up at 4am. They made special accommodations as we wanted to go to the big dunes and just spend one night in the desert because we were short on time.Our driver Brahim and guide Rachid were excellent. We felt safe driving the long distance over the atlas mountains and through the desert with brahim. He was prompt with timing and an excellent driver. On the ride out to the dunes we stopped in a few towns as we requested for tea and coffee and to see the local culture. We stopped at a few lookout points along the way as well. They were very flexible with stops as we drove. Rachid was very knowledgeable about the landscape, architecture, and Berber culture. Upon arrival at the dunes our accommodations were excellent. We were able to sandboard and explore. Rachid and Omer made an amazing dinner with traditional soup and lamb tagine. Truly excellent food. Brahim and Rachid graced us with some Berber drum music around the fire following dinner.The drive home was also exciting with stops in the village with a female carpet cooperative. Beautiful carpets and reasonable prices. Overall Brahim and Rachid really made our Chegaga experience everything we could have wanted and more. They were knowledgable and enjoyable to be around. Would definitely choose Rachid and Brahim to guide our trip again!Just an FYI that this trip is typically done in 3 days/2 nights but we had limited time in morroco. If you're open to the drive though it can be done by an early am departure on day one. These guys made it work and it didn't seem rushed at all. Michael and Varsha"

Both were extremely attentive and answered all our questions. They made sure we were enjoying ourselves at all times. The tour itself is very comprehensive. To me, it was the best way to get from one city to another, as it gives you the opportunity to see different berber villages, visit old kasbahs, cross the Atlas Mountains, and most importantly visit Erg Chebbi! A definite must!"

TopDesert organised it very well and provided a large minibus for the 7 of us which was very comfortable for the entire journey. Moubarak, our host, was a great guide and made sure that we made the most of our trip. The sites, food and hotel were all terrific.

Well done to Moubarak and his colleague who drove us more than 1200km. We had an amazing experience."

            "review": "Sahara desert in the summer. After reading countless of forum posts on tripadvisor and contacting a few other companies, we ultimately decided to book with TopDesert because Moha was always attentive and quick to reply to our e-mails and the package they offered was very competitive in relation to the price. It was a decision we definitely do not regret and would encourage everyone to book with TopDesert because of the hospitality offered by the guides! TopDesert is a small family company and both our driver and guide Moubarak & Mukha were very hospitable and did their best to accommodate to our requests. They were always ready to answer any questions we had & Moubarak was keen to share his vast knowledge of Morocco with us. As Morocco gets really hot in summer (reaching 40 degrees in the afternoon) and we were not able to deal with the heat well, Moubarak was able to plan our schedule such that we had lunch in the late afternoon to avoid the blazing heat! On the first day, Moubarak & Mukha arrived at our Riad exactly on time to pick us up and waited patiently for us to finish our breakfast before heading off. Throughout the trip, Moubarak was very accommodating of our requests and did his very best to make our trip as comfortable as possible. CarWe were picked up in a 4x4 vehicle which was very comfortable and had ample space for both of us. You can choose between airconditioning or natural fresh air and if you wanted a/c, don't hesitate to tell the guides! They are very friendly and the aircon worked well and helped us cool down when the weather was blazing. In addition, the car was clean and neat when we first went in, which meant that they had it cleaned up as they just finished a tour a day before. Accommodation The accommodation provided to us on the first night was perfect for the price we paid. The Aircon was working, which is something important in this 40 degrees weather. In addition, the toilet and shower was clean and working well. We had a comfortable night and had a good rest. To top it off, we were greeted with an amazing view of the waterfall from our room. Dinner and breakfast served were large in portions, and with quality.On the second night, we stayed in the desert and due to the heat, we decided to sleep on the pillows and beds laid out in the open in the desert with the guides and locals as it was too hot in the tent. We enjoyed the starry night & the Berber music the desert staff shared with us. Food served by the desert hosts were decent, with ample portions. The toilets and showers were surprisingly clean, and toilet flushes well, although the pressure in the shower could have been a little stronger . However, keep in mind that we are in the desert and so it is probably a lot harder to provide the same amenities. That said, Moubarak constantly checked on us to make sure that we were comfortable & even woke us up in the morning so we could catch the sunrise!Throughout the long car journey, there were a lot of photo stops made so that the journey did not feel so long. We visited the places included in the itinerary & they absolutely blew us away! Moubarak was always there to ask if we wanted a photo and a huge bonus was his great photography skills!! Thanks to him, we now have a lot of photos to look back fondly upon! All in all, if the weather had been better, we would definitely rate this trip 10/10! Thank you Moubarak for your hospitality & I encourage everyone to book your trip with TopDesert! You will not be disappointed! "

We were very lucky to have had Moubarak as our tourguide, we couldn't have wished anyone else. Throughout the entire trip, he told us the most interesting facts that made us able to understand Morrocan culture as well as the nature and history. We also got the opportunity to see the real, true Morroco. Moubarak was always in the best mood and couldn't get that funny smile from his face. He treated us like friends and made us feel welcome everywhere we went. By listening to his visions and stories, it became clear that our tourguide was someone with a beatiful, warm character. The first day of the tour we crossed the Atlas Mountains through a wonderful route and Moubarak stopped the car on the best places so we could take as many pictures as we wanted. At night we stayed in a nice hotel in the Dadesvalley. We received a warm welcome, the staff there was very friendly. The next morning we crossed another part of the Atlas Mountains and in the evening we arrived to the Sahara. After an epic camel ride through the Sahara, we stayed in a camp in the desert. The food there was absolutely delicious! The best and most pure Morrocan food, better than the food in all the recommended restaurants of Marrakesh, truly. After our meal, we had a perfect evening. Three lovely toearegs danced, sang and played music with us under a magical heaven full of stars. After a while Moubarak joined us too, which made it even more fun. The toearegs were so kind, welcoming and funny that I will remember that evening for the rest of my life! We got the chance to sleep outside under the stars. The last day we drove back to the Atlas Mountains through another route and we arrived back in Marrakesh in the evening. During the whole trip, there wasn't a single moment I was bored or not having fun. The landscapes were unbelievebly enchanting and we had the best company so it would be impossible to not have loved the tour. Thank you Top desert, Moubarak, the staff of the Dadeshotel and the toearegs for giving me three of the best days of my life.One essential tip for those who have planned a tour with Moubarak: if you download 'Helo' by Adele and lots of songs by Years&Years, the car will be turned into a real party and your gide will be the most happy man in Morocco!Lots of kisses, DJ Kato"

We had read that this desert and sand dunes is more magical than Zagora so we chose to do this tour. We woke up at 3 am to be picked up at 4 am with our driver Abdul. We couldn`t find any tours that had only 1 night as we were only in Morocco for 4 days and Top Desert was kind to arrange what they usually do in 3 days/2 nights to 2 days/1 night. It was a lot of driving but we are used to travelling long distances. We were able to visit Ait Benhaddou at 08h00 and there were only about 4 ppl there which was great. Our driver informed us that about 1000 people visit this location a day so we got to beat the rush! Abdul was very funny and knowledgeable. We are 2 young Canadians in our late 20`s and early 30`s and felt very safe! We ended up being the only 2 going into the desert with this tour company with camels and were a bit worried at first spending the night alone with a bunch of men but no one bothered us. Also there are many other camps that are very near by! Everyone was really kind and they sang us songs. They asked us to do something Canadian and we randomly did the ``Chicken Dance`` and explained many ppl do this at weddings for fun. While on our drive back I woke up to see our driver and my friend doing the ``chicken dance`` in the car. It became our joke. The supper at the berber camps was delicious!! It was a called Tajin. It was the best stew I have ever had and my father went to Morocco 40 years ago and said it was the best stew he has ever had as well! Would highly recommend it! However would recommend doing the 3 day/2 night tour if don`t want to drive 8-10 hours + a day.P.S. If your an animal lover, please bring some treats (all the animals eat soft cheese - even the cats (very soft cheese almost like philadelphia cream cheese type that I saved from the Riad) and I saved lots of uneaten cooked chicken or fish to feed the cats/dogs. I did learn that next time I visit a country with many strays I would bring some small containers and bring water - I don`t know where the animals drink in some of these hot places). So please do that, these animals would very much appreciate it! Thanks!"

We had an awesome guide named Moubarak who took great care of us in all aspects of the trip. The best part of this company was the interaction with local people in the Sahara and on the way there and back. We visited small villages and were given multiple opportunities to interact with locals and really feel the culture and spirit (which is entirely different to Marrakech!) Our guide helped us to learn basic language and inform us on all aspects of life in Morocco. The accommodation and restaurants we visited all had a local feeling and you didn't feel like a tourist and were always treated well by the staff. The Sahara is amazing. We spent a day in the local Oasis after riding there by camel, then returned to camp by camel at sunset. The sunsets and sunrise are great and the night sky is filled with stars. The staff in the camp were great, Hamid cooked great meals and cleaned up all the unwanted sand while we were out and our camel guide Mustapha also cooked an epic Tagine for us in the oasis. Overall we absolutely loved the trip and want to thank all the staff for there consistent hard work and attitude while also managing Ramadan, we really appreciate everything you did for us. The way they care for the local community and their attitude and commitment to making sure everyone is cared for is amazing and we will be taking that away with us. All the best to the top desert team and Moubarak, always take the weather with you!"

            "review": "Wonderful desert - poor driving!. Having picked this tour group from the many\u00a0 positive reviews on trip advisor, we had high expectations going on our 3 day, 2 nights tour to the desert from marrakech. The majority of this tour has met (or we would go so far as to say exceeded) our expectations although we did experience some issues. Our driver (Mubarak) picked us up an hour late, which wasn't a great start. However, shortly after pick up, we were driven to numerous beautiful sights on our way to the desert.The first thing we noticed in the 40 degree + heat in June, was that although our car had the option of air con, it wasn't used until we had to put it on ourselves (around 5 hours into our 7 hour drive as we couldn't take the heat any longer). Other than a very small part of our three day journey, the driver preferred to have the windows down (blowing oven hot air into the car) and so we were rather hot and uncomfortable throughout.\u00a0 My hair was also a windblown mess, sitting in the back seat.We were able to take some great pictures.\u00a0 The driver pointed out different sights to us but no explanations were given as to the history of what we were seeing.\u00a0 There were also a few times that we did feel a little scared with the driving - we were overtaking every car we came across round bends on the mountains, tailgating cars and the driver talked on his mobile whilst doing the driving - but thankfully there were no incidents other than oncoming vehicles flashing their lights at us for being so close to hitting each other. The driver also had his moroccan music on so loud that it gave us both a headache, although to his credit, he did turn it down when asked.\u00a0 We did raise the driving as an issue but we were told that if he hadn't been driving the way he had, then we wouldn't get anywhere. I was also mocked by the driver for being scared (he made reference to me as a woman which I found to be both sexist and very offensive) and was told that I should \"place my trust in god\" and basically deal with it, which was neither appreciated nor a useful response or indeed professional. There were several rest breaks put in for our incredibly long journey. At one point the driver drove off without notifying us,\u00a0 we believed he left to carry out personal shopping/errands. Our suitcase, belongings including our wallets were in the car with him and we had no idea whther he was going to come back to get us. He would also stop at markets to carry out personal shopping.\u00a0 Despite the above, we were thankful for the effort put in by the team especially during Ramadan, which we appreciate is a tough month. Once we arrived at the desert, we couldn't\u00a0 believe how beautiful it was. We stayed in absolute luxury in the Sahara desert. We were\u00a0 not expecting such comfort in the middle of no where, we had fully plumbed washing facilities, personal sun loungers, a private fire side traditional music experience and all of this was under the beautiful starry sky (it's worth waiting up to see the Milky way in all its glory).We were even able to celebrate our 30th birthday with a cake provided complimentary by the team!The team in the desert were amazing! They couldn't do enough to help and make our trip as enjoyable as possible and we absolutely loved it!We have never been more glad to get back to marrakech in one piece.\u00a0 We would rate the desert experience as 5 stars as we could not fault anything once we arrived. However, the driving did let us down a lot and so overall, we would rate this experience as 3 stars. "

My fianc\u00e9 booked our day excursion to Essaouira through Top Dessert, leaving from Marrakech.We had Moubarak as our driver for the two of us in his very spacious and comfortable car. We couldn't have asked for a better person to take us. He is a very kind, caring and generous man, who treated us more like old friends rather than paying customers. He made us feel very comfortable and welcome, and the trip was a pleasure to share with him. He was very happy to answer any questions we had and we also felt he taught us a lot about Moroccan culture and history.Our day started with Moubarak meeting us at our Riad in the Medina of Marrakech at 8am. He welcomed us and explained our itinerary for the day.The overall journey to Essaouira took about 3 - 3.5 hours with various stops along the way. The first stop being for coffee and breakfast in a nice cafe in a small village.From there our second stop was a short stop in the countryside to see the goats that climb the argan trees, which we both enjoyed very much and was a sight we had never seen before. The experience was only made better by getting to hold the most adorable baby goat.After that Moubarak took us to a woman's co-oprative where they make the argan oil. A very friendly lady took us to see the women at work where she talked us through the process and the different uses of the nut. She then took us to the shop where we sampled the different cosmetic and edible oils and butters, where these can be bought if you wish.It was then back in the car where we enjoyed more conversation and good Moroccan music with Moubarak. It was then a short drive to our last stop before Essaouira which was a view point looking over Essaouira and the coast. Here we took photos and you could ride camels if you wanted.Then the final leg of the trip took us to the Medina wall of Essaouira where Moubarak gave us a short walk around the Medina explaining the area then he walked us down to the port where he suggested we had lunch, which we did. He then left us to it to have a look around the town for about 4 hours, which was plenty of time. We had a lovely lunch on the port where we got to chose our fish, which had all been caught that morning. We then casually walked around the Medina and did some shopping. For any music lover you must visit Bob's music, which was a hidden gem.After our time in Essaouira we met Moubarrk back at the car to make our journey back to Marrakech.All in all we would highly recommend this trip and if you have Moubarak as your driver you are in safe hands and will have a lot of fun along the way! Also to add my fianc\u00e9 said Moha was fantastically helpful when it came to organising the trip. We wanted a trip to Essaoaira as my fianc\u00e9's mother had been and Moha helpfully recommended that a day trip would be the perfect amount of time to take it all in which it was. He was very responsive and helpful. Highly recommend without a doubt!! Sean and Noemie"

It will be wrong today that this is a once in a lifetime experience as it is very affordable all things inclusive and we would certainly like to relive this wonderful experience again one day. Our guide Mubarak is very experienced and highly knowledgeable. He never failed to make sure we were comfortable and he always wore a smile. Highlights of the trip included Camel trekking in the Sahara, sand boarding in the dunes. We were also serenaded by Berber music around the campfire under a starlit night sky. We were also shown the varying landscapes of morocco and had the opportunity to see the way of life of the locals. It was truly an eye opening experience and I would highly recommend anyone intending to visit Morocco to do so, and to do so with TOP desert tours."

We were a bit concerned how it would be with only three people in the car but our driver, Salah, quickly changed our mind on this.As a guide he is laid back and gives you the privacy you need whilst having great knowledge of the country and sites that you visit. He pulled out a little hidden gem en route to the desert which enabled us to see the water well canals between the mountains and Oasis - a great little extra.The vehicle was very comfortable and made the longer journeys that bit easier.Would highly recommend both Top Desert and Salah to anyone who asked.The trip itself - highlights were Erg Chebbi dunes, Telouet Kasbah and Todra Gorge but the whole trip had loads to see along the way.Top tip - finish it off with a bit of luxury - it's a busy 3 days!Will definitely return."

No question a camel trek across the Erg Chebbi dunes would be memorable - but it's the people you share it with that really makes such an excursion exceptional! Our guides Moubarak and Adil, as well as Ibrahim (driver coach - excellent job!), were wonderful hosts. Their knowledge, friendliness, and enthusiasm made us feel like partners in this adventure, as opposed to only paying customers. No request, big or small, was turned down (ex: \"isn't there a solar farm out that way? Yes, there is - so let's go find it!\") and they did their very best to ensure we were comfortable, well fed, safe and seeing all the key sights. Two notes: these guides were not only excellent drivers over the 1100+ km trip, but they could really sing (Moubarak) and drum (Adil)! We really enjoyed this three day trip - I would highly recommend signing up with Top Desert for this tour. Don't forget to ask for Moubarak and Adil!"

            "review": "Adventure of a lifetime; A very generous and kind \"business\". Moubarak, our guide, is and will likely remain one of the most kind, generous, thoughtful and optimistic individuals I have had the good fortune of coming into contact with. Five friends accompanied me as we traveled to Marrakech, all of us experiencing our first trip to the African continent in our young lives. Immediately we were blown away by the culture shock that makes up that hectic city, but not soon after inspired by the open and vibrant nature of the people there. We had been in contact with \"Moha\" and embarked on our (3 day) \"Marrakech desert trip to Erg Chegaga dunes\" the morning after our initial arrival (I would recommend doing what we did and dedicating 2 days to see Marrakesh itself; we returned for another night after the tour). Moubarak picked us up at our hostel's doors and immediately began conversing and getting to know all of us. He frequently told us stories, and never ceased to spread his contagious optimism about life as we traversed many many miles throughout the Moroccan countryside. He knows his country. That can be concluded without a doubt. He and other members of Top Desert have not placed \"profit\" or \"business\" as their greatest priorities. No, instead Moubarak's philosophy towards life is one where he can share stories, spread cheer, and as clich\u00e9 as this all sounds: see to it that the world consistently progresses towards being a better place. Throughout your stay he will take you to see snow in the Atlas mountains, the Saharan desert, and countless Berber villages. Knowing the country and being an excellent driver allowed him to allow us to see a large portion of the southern third of the country. Too, he never left us uninformed about cultural or historical significance behind the places we visited. The night in the desert is truly harmonious; no modern buildings to block your sights or smog to prevent the night sky from being draped in bright stars. My only complaint about my trip with Top Desert stems from my own foolishness - only allowing myself a week to traverse this remarkable country, and only allotting enough funds to spend three days with top desert. I hope to return to Morocco one day, hopefully alongside family or close friends, and when I do I will most certainly be looking into contacting Top Desert. There is something for everyone in Morocco - brilliant landscapes, cultural hubs, forests, mountains, and ocean. The Moroccans know their country best, so it never hurts to allow a new friend such as Moubarak guide you in a manner that allows you to see so much of it in such little time."

Added to this, his car was air conditioned and comfortable. The road through the Atlas mountains does twist and turn though so those suffering from travel sickness may wish to take tablets.Camel riding through the desert edge and small dunes was good fun and we arrived at camp in time to climb a massive dune and watch the sun set over the Sahara desert - a memory to keep forever!The camp itself was comfortable, with beautiful tents complete with proper beds, plentiful blankets and electricity. There was even a shower block and toilets which were kept very clean.The food, served in a lovely communal tent, was very tasty, as was the tea! The traditional music after dinner was another happy memory as well.On the journey home Abba was his usual happy, helpful self, stopping at many places for stunning photograph opportunities, the film studios, Kasbah and lunch."

Initially, we had a problem with a change in flight time and before we even arrived to Morocco they were helpful and accommodating. Once we were there, it was nothing short of spectacular. Our sherpa was Abdul who is knowledgeable, funny and stopped at nothing to ensure we had an amazing trip. We did the two day one night trip to Erg Lihoudi Dunes. We were able to ride camels, go sand boarding and camp for the night. The food provided was delicious- they even accommodated for some dietary restrictions. The tents were comfortable and the sherpas even moved around beds so that my friends and I could stay together. Each of the two days we had a 9 hour car ride which was pretty long but the views along the way were beautiful and Abdul stopped whenever we were hungry or needed to use the restroom and also provided an aux cord. In addition, Abdul had his brother pick us up from our hotel and drive us to the airport even after our tour was over. I would recommend this company to absolutely anyone, especially Abdul."

We opted for the 3 day, 2 night excursion from Marrakech to Fes with a night in the desert at Erg Chebbi. From the beginning, everything was seamless. Rabii \u2013 an incredibly nice, wise, and philosophical guy that we had endless fun with! \u2013 met us at the airport and we departed from there. The tour was very comfortable; the first day was packed with beautiful sights and caf\u00e9s or spots to rest. We stayed that night in the most idyllic riad in a fairly secluded valley. Waking up in that valley was otherworldly. We then departed to the desert. We took camels to a beautiful tent camp from which you could see the border with Algeria. (Sandboarding, drumming, dancing, and stargazing all part of the fun.) The last day dropped us in Fes, stopping in various small cities along the way.We planned to stay in Fes one day, and graciously, Rabii offered to stay a day and take us back to Marrakech the next (not usually covered in the tour). We worked it out so that we paid Rabii the same amount we would pay the Moroccan coach. This was perfect for all of us, and it was bittersweet to say goodbye to Rabii at the end.This was the highlight of our week. I wouldn't have done it any other way. Through talking with Rabii and the locals, I feel like I got an accurate and insightful look into what Morocco means to them, which is what I find most meaningful.To clarify, we were four students, and this was a very good use of time and money on a student budget."

Right from my first contact with Moha, I was extremely well guided and all questions patiently answered. Adil and Ibrahim, the 2 Berber guides/Chauffeur made made my trip extremely special with their kindness and super friendly approach. we also had wonderful discussions all along the way. The Landcruiser provided was very comfortable. The highlight of the tour was certainly the Sahara Desert, which was a dream-come-true for me. I couldn't imagine such a great desert camp right in-between the dunes. The Camp is like a miracle (tastefully done accommodation, flowing hot water etc..). Overall, Top desert must your choice, if you are looking for interaction with locals, understand Berber culture and feel one among them. After all, this trip means much more than just clicking photos at beautiful spots on the way. Well done Top Desert Tours and high respects from me!"

With plenty of oppurtunities to take pictures and stretch your legs.Once at the dunes you must savour every moment as you don't get long there. We chose to quad bike for an hour, I 100% recommend this!! Then we rode a camel. The dunes are absolutely amazing and the sunset was so peaceful and beautiful. I would totally redo the trip just for to do it all again. Also, the boy who was working at the camp at the dunes was timid but very likeable and made our time at the dunes relaxing and comfortable. I would recommend this trip to anyone. Accommodation and food through out was good. I have a few tips if you are to go:1. Bring sweeties for the nomad and Berber children2. Don't go to the gallery, this was the only negative about our trip. They say you are obliged not to buy anything but don't take no for an answer and are quite brash and forceful in getting a yes3. If you have sensitive skin bring a full set of pjs for the tent. I have sensitive skin and have come up in a rash from the sheets while my bf is fine. I can't hold this against them as my skin is ultra sensitive! "

Top Desert provides smooth, magic carpet trips through the mountains, past Kasbahs and gorges to the dunes of the south. And back, sadly. A magic carpet Land Cruiser picks you up and whisks you away from bustling airport or chaotic Marrakech, stopping where you wish en route. Your driver, in our case Excellent Abdul, provides commentary and explanation where and when you need it. And the number of beautiful things to see is phenomenal. It's worth being aware that there's a lot of driving involved (although you can also spend days, lazy or active, as you wish, in the desert). Certainly in early spring the nights are really cold.

I will start by saying that that was our single favorite experience in Morocco.We chose to do a 3 days tour to Erg Chergaga and everything went as smoothly as possible. Moha was really helpful with the booking and he always answered every e-mail or WhatsApp message right away.We got picked up at our Riad in Marrakesh right on time and we made the trip in a very confortable, very big and new Land Rover. On the way to the desert we stopped at a lot of beautiful sites, including the place where they shoot a lot of famous movies like The Gladiator and Game of Thrones!The road to the desert is really really beautiful.. we drove by all those really brown moutains with all these really green and lush oasis on its feet. It was one of the most beautiful landscapes we ever saw!Then we got to the Sahara Desert. SO. AMAZING.I wanted to cry when we got there, I wanted to cry when we watched the sunset overlooking miles and miles of sand dunes. I wanted to cry when the night came and we were greeted with THE MOST AMAZING starry sky of our lives! There were zillions of stars EVERYWHERE we looked. The sky was SO BIG, you had a perfect 360\u00ba view of the horizon. I never felt so connected with nature, SO BLESSED by its beauty.And then I have to talk about our guide and driver, Abdoul. I'll start by saying that you are actually NOT our guide and driver, you are family.We couldn't have asked for a better person to spend these 3 days with. He know so much about Morocco, he is so smart, so funny, so friendly! He played soccer with my dad and my sister, he played and sang berber songs for us, he told us stories and played charades with us. He gave my dad his turban as a sign of friendship and he now has a Brazil shirt to remember us! We named the desert dog together (Astolfo, remember? hahaha). And on the way back, when me and my father were feeling sick, he even took care of us and gave us medicine. You were amazing, Abdoul! Thank you so much for everything! And remember that when you come to Brazil, you have a home here! And also you have to come because we need to play soccer again, the re-match! hahahaWe would also like to thank everyone else that spent the night at the desert with us.. Ali, you were so great helping go up at the dunes and bringing us water when we felt like passing out hahaha and thank you for sharing the sunset with us! We have photos together that I will e-mail to Moha later, so you can see :)Anyway.. if I could give one advise for those planning a trip to Morocco, that would be it: GO TO THE SAHARA. Watch the sunset over the dunes. Stay up at night admiring the most amazing sky. And do that with TOP DESERT and Abdoul. I assure you, you will never forget this experience.(The person from Top Desert who reads this, could you please show it to Abdoul and Ali? It would really mean a lot to us!)"

There's no way you'll know everything that you want to do before you get here, and their flexibility and ability to plan activities and reservations on the spot was mind-blowing. We were picked-up at the airport by our main guide, Abdul, who was outstanding, and considered a good friend to all of us now. He went far out of his way for us on numerous occasions and was just incredible. He was also a safe and great driver, something I can absolutely appreciate now, afterwards.Before going on our desert tour, we also expressed interest in hiking the Atlas mountains (Toubkal). They set us up with incredible and hospitable guides that took care of everything. We also ate lunch and slept in a Berber village--an incredible experience. In addition to answering about a thousand of our questions about Marrakesh and Morocco in general, we drove to Erg Chebbi (in a nice Land Cruiser) and spent the night in the desert, rode camels, 4x4s, sand-boarding, etc. They made it all happen without issue and always asking for our feedback. There were also several places, food, shopping and experiences before, during and after the desert and hiking trips that they helped us out with and just made the entire trip amazing.

An old work colleague recommended Top Desert, having just traveled with them. I emailed Moha, who handles the bookings, and his communication was excellent. We requested Moubarak, as my friend had spoken really highly of him. Top Desert was really flexible, allowing us to put together a slightly different itinerary. We had the entire trip booked a week in advance - very short notice, but Top Desert delivered. We spent 10 days in Morocco and 7 of them with Moubarak. Our itinerary took us from Marrakech to Erg Chebbi in the Sahara, traveling via the Dades Gorge. After Erg Chebbi we went up to Fes, stayed a night, and then went on to Chefchaouen for one night (to see the famous blue Medina) before returning to Fes and flying out. Essentially we took the 5-day desert tour from Marrakech to Fes, and added a two return trip to Chefchaouen. I highly recommend it. It's worth noting that Moubarak didn't have the necessary paperwork to be our guide for Fes or Chefchaouen, as it wasn't really part of their set tour. We were told of that in advance, and it was not an issue as both of those places we were eager to explore solo. In terms of handling the bookings, Moha did a fantastic job, and there was constant communication between he and Moubarak throughout the trip to make sure things we running smoothly. While on our trip we met another Top Desert guide, Abdou, who was with another group. We found a deck of cards and played a few games of cards with him. He's an absolute legend.But now some things about Moubarak. He's a very safe and experienced driver. At the very beginning of our journey, heading into the Atlas mountains we got stuck behind a convoy carrying all the King's horses (literally). We crept along behind the convoy for a good 40 minutes until Moubarak found a moment where it was safe to overtake. He has the patience of a saint. He is from the south, specifically Merzouga, so he knows the people and region he's showing you. He knows where the best view is. Where the cleanest, tastiest food is. He also knows an incredible amount about Morocco's history and geography - as we found out later in our journey, Moubarak has also studied many of the major philosophers. Come armed with questions, because Moubarak is a knowledgable man. He likes music - bring a good playlist and an aux cord, and make sure \"Stand By Me\" and \"Hotel California\" are on there. Oh, and \"Know Yourself\" by Drake. He'll help you put together your Moroccan playlist.He likes to stop and buy fruit from the farmers along the road. And it's really, really good.He knows a backroad in the cedar forest of Azrou that will bring you up close and personal with some incredible wildlife. He does an incredible amount behind the scenes. I got a sinus infection in the desert and my nose swelled up instantly. By the time we got back from our camel trek Moubarak had made a return trip to the pharmacy in Merzouga and brought back medicine. I didn't ask, he just went. I had some antibiotics and was fine within a day. Choose Top Desert. You'll be glad you did when you're sitting comfortable in your Toyota Landcruiser, watching the giant tour buses navigating the narrow passes. You'll be glad you did when you see that of all the desert camps, you're staying in the best one. But mostly you'll be glad you did because you'll have the time of your life, and you'll make at least one new friend.Thank you Moubarak, thank you Moha!"

Our guide, Abdoul, was knowledgable, showing us every point of interest over our 3-day trip and helping us capture memories with great photos! He was very friendly and the tour wouldn't have been the same without his guidance and familiarity with the desert. Also, as a group of women, he made us feel very safe and secure in a country we were unfamiliar with, which is invaluable. Top Desert is a family company and you feel that in the authentic experience that is delivered. The tours provided by Top Desert really help you see Morocco from a local's point of view and our experience was unforgettable. Morocco is beautiful and Top Desert is the way to see it! I'm so glad we traveled with Top Desert - I would do it again without hesitation!!!"

            "review": "Exceeded Expectations!! - 3 Day Private Desert Tour from Marrakech to Fes. The Top Desert website is very detailed, so I will save you all the redundancy of describing the itinerary and focus more on the quality of the amazing experience. :) This is my first review on anything (ever!) so you know that this company must be absolutely fantastic enough for me to even create this profile in the first place.I originally sent an email inquiry for the tour for a group of 3, and Moha was more than accommodating in answering my million questions and helping to sort out the payment method (I didn't realize Visa 3D secure was different than regular Visa.)Once we got the trip sorted out, we didn't have to do anything else! Our driver and guide, Abdoul, met us at our Riad in Marrakech at 7am on the dot, and the rest is history. Not only was the Land Cruiser itself quite comfortable (and we were in it for a long time), but Abdoul made sure we were good every km of the way, from letting us listen to our Western music (we switched it up and grooved to some Moroccan tunes too), to stopping for our countless photo opportunities, to making sure we were getting the best deals on all of the souvenirs and goods we wanted to buy.I have not laughed as much as I have on this trip in awhile. Abdoul went above and beyond, and always put our safety and well-being first, but he couldn't prevent the stomach pain and tears from our countless belly laughs ;) and he is a great percussionist to boot!Our camel trek was about 2 hours long, and another guide, Aziz, led our group through the desert, had us stop for an epic sunset (which turned into a photoshoot), and took us to the Berber camp. The camels were very docile and i even had a selfie session with my camel, Bob Marley, but man, make sure you stretch before and after! Those Camel Massages are no joke!The food, the accommodations, and the destinations were all top-notch, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves every minute of the tour. When Abdoul dropped us off at our Riad in Fes, it was one of the hardest goodbyes we've ever had to do!Moha and Abdoul, I commend you for creating this family-oriented tour company, and for giving the best customer service I've ever received. I know the two other girls in our group feel the same, but they want to write their own reviews just so we can all give 5 stars :)Thank you for giving us the tour of a lifetime!kathy"

Very responsive with arrangements through email and wattsapp, and they delivered on what they said they would - a very smooth, professional experience. Khalid is a lovely guy, very knowlegeable and willing to go the extra mile to make sure we had a wonderful time. The desert camp was right on the edge of the desert, and apart from the poor (ie unusable) state of the sandboards and boots, it was a really cool place - great food (our 'tent' even had a shower with hot water!) and in a wonderful location.We would recommend Khalid, Moha and Top Desert without hesitation.

Our camel trekking was a once in a lifetime experience. We chose to \"glamp\" and all felt it was worth the extra money.

We strongly recommend them.All the comments in tripadvisor were important for us to make a decision at the time.

I'm a city girl who doesn't like dirt, nature, camping or really anything related to outdoors. But I am open-minded and willing to try things because I've only got this one life. I'm glad I visited Morocco and experienced this tour. I felt safe and welcomed. Not showering for a couple days was a choice I made, and I'd do it again for an experience like this. Like pretty much everyone who is heading to a new country for the first time, I had a lot of questions and worries. Moha is the one who answers emails, and he is very prompt and amenable to tailoring the tour to our needs. We did the 4 day/3 night tour. We were picked up at our Riad in Marrakesh (Hotel Arabe). We spent two nights in the desert and one night in a Riad on the way back. He even dropped us at the airport!Our driver was great. He drove fast to get us to the desert in time for the sunset on day 1. The off-roading was bumpy but it was clear he was in his element. He knew what he was doing, and we were in a safe car.The desert campsite is beautiful. We were there 2 nights and decided not to shower so can't comment on those. The toilets are ok. They don't flush, and you pour water down when done. Dinners were always great. Breakfast was adequate. I would recommend bringing your own soap. The soap for washing your hands wasn't that great, and I'm wondering if that is what got us sick by the end of the trip.One of the days we did a camel tour to a nomad's home for lunch. It was 2.5 hours on the camel each way. We ended up with bruised bums and incredibly sore muscles. I'll never ride a camel again, but this one experience was worth the pain. The nomad and his family only spoke Arabic. The teenage daughter spoke some French, so I was able to communicate with her a bit but overall we just simply chilled at their temporary home for a few hours for tea, biscuits and lunch. A goat ultimately ate all my biscuits, but that's ok. It was the most authentic experience we had and awesome!I would not recommend riding a camel for longer than 30-45 minutes at a time... unless you want seriously painful thigh gap. Therefore, ask for the shorter camel ride to watch the sunrise in the morning or to a nearby desert restaurant for lunch. My camel did take a nose dive and popped right back up. I wasn't thrown thanks to holding on for dear life, but that was pretty scary!The sunrises, sunsets and stars at night are the best part of the trip. We stayed in the luxury tents and they were great. Lighting isn't the best, so make sure to use your iphone flashlight or bring one. Keep your phones on airport mode so you can use necessary features like alarms and flashlights without losing too much battery. On the way back, we stayed at Ellouze Riad relatively close to Ourzazate. It was a decent riad with adequate showers, a beautiful garden and view, and a decent pool. The owner is French and the food was great. The next day on the drive to the airport, we stopped for lunch at a restaurant recommended by our guide in Marrakesh before heading to the airport. It was some of the best couscous I've ever eaten. Then he dropped us off at the airport with plenty of time before our flight.We gave our guide a big tip at the end because the whole trip really was above and beyond. I'll post some pics when I get a chance, but I assure you a picture could never capture our amazing experience. So what are you waiting for? BOOK NOW!"

I was a bit apprehensive before the trip since I'm paying such a large downpayment to a company I don't know in a foreign country, but I'm glad that the tour exceeded my expectations. Moha, the owner, was responsive and answered my \"numerous\" \"numerous\" questions and gave me all the information I needed to customize the trip. Moha, our driver and guide, exceeded our expectations. Without him, the trip experience would not have been the same. Not only did he look like a well seasoned tour guide, he had alot of experience, had a great personality and took care of us very well. I had asked the owner for a guide who could speak english well and our guide exceeded my expectations.The camel ride was a bit different than I expected. While still in America planning the trip, the owner told me that the camel ride would be 1.5 - 2 hrs but our camel ride was only about 25 minutes total... I was fine with the short camel ride, but if I had known that the camel ride was only 25 minutes, I wouldn't have bought desert gear when I was still in America.My opted for the luxury tents and it also exceeded our expectations. The onsite staff were awesome. The tents were great and I had no complaints about the tent, bathroom, showers, and mattress. The food at dinner was great but the breakfast wasn't very good. We were told by the staff that we should wake up early to see the sunset and that they would take us at a specific time in the morning, but when morning came, no one took us to see the sunset; we had to go on our own.The only real minus of the trip was that we never got to do sandboarding even when I had specifically mentioned it to our guide. This was partly because we wasted alot of time at 2 \"sales\" visits - ie, visits to 2 establishments that were packaged as cultural visits but they really wanted us to buy stuff. The most annoying sales visit was to a carpet store that took more than an hour. We did get a nice demo of their many many carpets, but even though the host insisted that buying was not necessary, his staff didn't take no for an answer and were doing hard sells and used many other pressure tactics. They wouldn't leave me alone even though I had no intention of buying any rugs. For the record, their rugs were very expensive and I didn't buy any.Despite some of the minuses that I mentioned, which were not egregious, I would absolutely recommend Top Desert. They are reputable and provide high quality tours."

We did not get a tour guide as we thought we would but our driver was pretty good at giving us some history and facts about the areas we went through. We did not feel rushed through anything and was given as much time as we needed at each stop. the ride through the Atlas mountains was amazing and the hotel was fantastic. Everyone staff member was polite and very easy going. The trip to the dessert was amazing! We did not get a offer for sand boarding but we were not interested. The dunes and the view of the Algerian boarder were phenomenal! I have been camping lots but nothing like sleeping under the stars in the Sahara. The food at every place was at least good most were excellent. We were introduced to many locals who of course always had a pitch but we never felt pressure to but a thing. We actually were welcomed into the home of some carpet makers got to see first hand how they did there work. Now of course we were offered to by a rug or 2 after tea and conversation but when we could not buy one there were no hard feelings. The experience in that mans home actually motivated us to find the money to bring a large carpet home. So I guess his pitch worked :). Over all this was a great experience but be ready for a lot of time in the truck! it is a long drive but so much to see."

We opted for Top desert, because they quickly responded to questions and delivered customer service to which you feel comfortable to fully prepay the trips.On a Monday we went to Ouzoud. Our driver, Khalid, is very nice, careful driver and knowledgeable about his country. He actually recommended us to change our 3-day desert tour from erg chagaga to erg chebbi. The reason is that erg chebbi has beautiful red colored dunes, so we were sold. The day tour to Ouzoud was a great experience. We did not opt for a tourguide, and stupid us, we got lost. So you might want to be less 'adventures' and opt for the guide.Khalid was also our driver for the 3-day desert tour starting on Wednesday and you can hear he is passionate about his country. We had ample opportunity to take pictures or take potty breaks. You will visit the high atlas mountains, its kasbahs, the Telouet kasbah and the world heritage protected ait benhaddou kasbah. The hotel on the first night was in Ourzazate and it was beautiful and comfortable. The second night was in a camp, and it was an experience we will never forget. It is wonderful to be in the desert, but we are a little bit high maintenance, so the very simple toilet and shower threw us off a bit. However, that did not stop us from enjoying this experience. The third day you drive back to Marrakech, which is a very long ride, but possible to do. Just sit back and enjoy the view, because it is just gorgeous.Thank you Moha, for your quick and professional services during the reservations and a special thanks to Khalid, who is so kind and customer focused, you cannot not feel comfortable sitting next to him for three days. Thank you Top Desert, for delivering us a once in a lifetime experience."

Since the camel ride at the sunset, our conversations under the sky full of stars, the dinner (the best tagine that I ate at Morrocco), the songs and the games after the dinner, the sunrise at the dunes.. We loved it! :) And the sky... That sky! The most starry sky that I've ever seen.. And the silence.. Wonderful!

The car was nice and clean and the driver (Habib) and guide (Muhammad) were excellent. We did the 2 night/3 day Erg Chebbi Sahara tour and were advised that if there was ANYTHING we wanted to do on the way or anything we wanted to know, that we were to ask as it was \"our trip\". We stopped off every hour or two, sometimes just to take pics and sometimes for a little break from driving. The places we stopped off were beautiful and the guide had so much to tell us. Any question we asked he had a wealth of knowledge about and usually a funny story to go with it. The place we stayed on the first night was unbelievable. We spotted a waterfall close by which we went to and had a dip in the water. Great place for photographs too. We then had dinner and relaxed on the terrace with an amazing view. The food was delicious and we were treated like kings by the lovely staff. We all agreed that if the trip was to end before we even got to the desert that we would have been happy with paying the amount we did. So when we actually did arrive at the drop off spot for the desert we were super excited, and it didn't disappoint!When we arrived in the desert after our camel ride and picture taking we had dinner, and then after that we relaxed with our guides and a few locals. They played some music for us and then they went to bed, leaving us to explore a bit. We lay on one of the dunes looking up at the clear star filled sky while having a few beers that we picked up on the way, until the early hours. It was the most peaceful experience I've had and probably the best night of my life! The trip continued for another day and we were happy enough to be finishing it off as there was so much driving. I would recommend anyone considering this tour to go with this company and if possible ask for the same guide that we had (Muhammad) as we were in no way disappointed."

They always stopped whenever I wanted to take a picture, and if I needed anything out of the ordinary, they always helped track it down for me. I was there for 15 days and visited about 85% of the country. The highlights were, of course, the Erg Chebbi dunes where I went camel trekking and dune buggying. They were both great, but the dune buggying was incredible!! I also went hot-air ballooning near Marrakech for the very 1st time (and I've been to 64 countries). I also checked prices and compared them to other companies out there, and their prices were very competitive with the companies I checked, but they really excelled in helping me plan my trip and Moha was able to get back to me via email ASAP to make any necessary changes we had to make. The riads were clean and comfortable and centrally located to the tourist areas. I highly recommend Top Desert...and if you ever had any doubts about travelling to Morocco...I felt very safe (and walked around, many times after midnight), the people were friendly and easy-going.

Booking was smooth and they respond well to our emails and make accommodations if asked. They were prompt and on time to pick us up and we had a great time with our driver! He spoke English well and knew all the sites along the way and treated us very kindly. Once we reached their camp site, they made us tea and we went on the camels and went sandboarding! They made us dinner and entertained us around a campfire in the night. We got to see sunrise the next morning and then headed back to the city. It was a very great and awesome experience!"

Our guide Khaled was nice, accommodating and knowledgeable. We did a tour from Fez to Marrakesh via camping (glamping really) Erg Chebbi - our highlight. Star gazzing round a camp fire into the dessert sky was really a great experience. Highly recommended."

            "review": "The Highlight of the Journey. The cheerful, knowledgeable Abdul from the Top Dessert team picked us up in the Riad for the standard Atlas Mountain - Sahara Desert Tour. We booked 4 days and three nights. This reduces the time spent in the car a bit, which was great for our two teenage sons. The first day we went over the (still partially snow covered) Atlas Mountains and saw picturesque Berber Villages and the amazing Kasbah in Telouet. After a night in Quarzazat we went through the sheer endless Oasis of the Draa Valley into the dessert and stayed overnight in tents in the Erg Chegaga Sand Dunes. That afternoon and night in the dunes was one of the most magical travel experiences of my life. In a landscape straight out of the \"English Patient\", Abdul organised a sunset Camel ride and arranged dinner for the family in a secluded spot in the dunes, lit by millions of stars. We slept in spartan, but comfortable Touareg tents.The next day we drove back to Bab Rimal and after a relaxing for one last night in the Oasis drove back to Marrakech.The best part is: Before this trip my boys liked going on holidays, after our time with Abdul, they can't wait until we go travelling to far places."

It was a very good experience, with a comfortable Toyota, Land Cruiser and and excellent driver-quide (Hamid - I highly recommend him). He gave us a lot of good tips and showed us some great places to eat. He was able to communicate fluently in 2 languages (english and french) and helped us to communicate with the locals.The night in the dessert was very nice. Even if we stayed in a traditional tent there were all needed facilities (toiled, shower, current water) and an excellent food. The only negative aspect was the accommodation on the first night in the Dar Essyaha Hotel, where was very cold and we had tasteless food for dinner. Over all I recommend Top Desert."

The tour involved a lot of driving but the views and terrain visible from the car were very interesting. The desert camp was very cool -nestled in against the dunes and the guys entertained us with music around the campfire that evening. Our guide was very friendly and gave us a free lift to the airport the day after the tour. Stopping at A\u00eft Ben Haddou on the way back was very interesting and the drive through the back roads into the Atlas mountains from there was stunning.If you've only got 2 days free then this is a good option but you will spend a lot of time driving. February was a good time to visit as the weather was a pleasant improvement from Europe bu t the streets weren't overcrowded with tourists."

            "review": "Excellent desert and other tour operator. We took the two-night desert tour, and also a day trip to Essaouira. Most of the review relates to the desert tour, as essentially the Essaouira trip was primarily a transport service.The most importAnt aspect of the trip was the guide, and Salah was fantastic - really cautious driver, very easy-going, friendly, knowedgeable about Morocco, its people, the desert and just about everything else. The cherry on the icing on the cake was when my other half forgot her sunglasses in the car after our last trip, and he came to give them to us the next day at no extra cost.The vehicle was also excellent - clearly a purpose-built all-terrain 4x4 (Toyota Land Cruiser), reliable in the desert terrain but also very comfortable.If I had to make a negative comment I'd say some of the venues chosen for stopovers on the way to the desert could have been better - the food was generally pretty poor - but then I guess there were probably limited options in those towns and villages. Not enough to knock off a star!The locations in the desert (the lunch stop and the camp) were very nice - the desert camp with decent sanitary facilities (although do use bottled water to brush your teeth!) and the lunch stop a very nice little oasis. And the food prepared by the cooks in those places was some of the best we had: succulent chicken skewers for lunch, and an excellent tagine for supper (despite it having been prepared in a sandstorm!)And finally - the main event, camel trekking and sandboarding in the dunes, is amazing - mainly for the views over the rolling sea of sand. My one regret is that in 'M Hamid (the last village before the desert, where you spend the first night) we didn't venture into town. There are a few cafes serving desert tourists, but other than that it's a proper desert town with few of the trappings of Western civilisation - we saw it through the windows of our car. You have time for a walk around on the morning of your second day before driving off into the Sahara but we missed out through sheer ignorance.All in all, a wonderful excursion, very worthwhile!"

I am a college student and was studying abroad in Europe for the summer of 2014. 5 of us (2 girls and 3 boys) really wanted to go to Africa and sleep in the Sahara. We did a lot of research and I ended up contacting Top Desert, and I ended up talking to Moha who is probably the best customer service agent I have ever spoken with. He worked with our cramped time schedule, responded quickly, and answered the million questions I asked about the tour. Our group flew into Casablanca, took a train to Marrakech, and despite the fact that we arrived and hour after we had previously told Moha, our tour guide Sala (not sure of the spelling) was waiting for us at the train station with a sign with my name. The vehicle was super nice (a Four Runner if I remember correctly) and he was a great driver. Very safe. He drove us out of Marrakech and into the Sahara. It is a very long ride, but it seems short and relaxing because we took a break about every hour it seemed to stop at various sites along the way. All of the stops were amazing and even just the scenery while driving was breath taking! After learning a lot about Morocco, eating lunch in front of the kasbah where they filmed Gladiator (so cool), climbing the kasbah, making argon oil, and so much more, we made it out to the desert! The Sahara is awesome! There we arrived at a camp where there was no one but one guy who works there. It was really cool! We rode camels around the dunes, watched the sunset, ate a delicious, homeade (by the two guides) meal, and watched for shooting stars (we saw 5!). In the morning we woke up to see the sunrise (worth it!) and headed back to Marrakech with stops along the way.I really hope to go back and stay longer because a weekend was just enough to fall in love with Morocco! Thank you so much to Top Desert for the trip of a lifetime! I posted some pictures too!"

We didn't expect such a great trip and specially the professionalism of TopDesert tour. During the reservation process we were always guided by Moha. He was very nice and he always answered all of our questions. Our guide Salah was a great guy. He was very respectful and even being the Ramadan days, he always respected us and let us have our snacks during the trip. Even though it was a long trip to the desert, he made several stops to take pictures, to have a coffe or a drink, to use a bathroom or to visit places of interest. This really helped us to stretch once in a while and made the trip much more confortable. Salah always looked for places with internet connection (Wi-Fi), so we could be in contact with our loved ones or to post pictures of our great adventure on Facebook :) The breakfasts and dinners included were delicious tipycal food. The hotel in Dades was phenomenal, the staff was great and the rooms were amazingly decorated and spotless clean. Sincerely, we didn't expect such a great night in the desert, even thought it was very hot during the night, we slept outside the tents under the sky and it was amazing (it is important to remember that a trip to the desert involves sand, high temperatures, bugs and a lot of adrenaline). The experience in the dunes was really magical. We highly recommended this tour. Salah, our guide, was professional, funny and respectful. Thank you Salah and thank you TopDesert tours."

            "review": "3 Day Erg Chebbi Desert Trip. We went on this tour last week. We booked the tour through Moha who answered all our emails and sent us detailed itineraries. Considering what seemed quite a high price for this tour (380 EUR per person), there were some problems. On the day we were picked up at our Riad by our guide (we think his name was Wahid, not sure how to spell it) and then went to meet our driver Rachid. On our way to the hotel for the first night we stopped at a lot of excellent viewpoints which were also good opportunities to stretch our legs as we naively had not realised how much travelling and sitting in the car was involved in the trip. We also stopped at a couple of kasbahs including Ait Benhaddou. We enjoyed these sights and walking round Ait Benhaddou, although felt that our guide did not give us a lot of information about the history of the places. We also stopped at the movie studios in Ouarzazate. Although we didn't want to do the hour-long tour here our guide told us we didn't have the time. This seemed a bit strange as we were then at our hotel for the night by 4:30!The hotel (Xaluca Dades) was fabulous, really nice with great facilities, food, and views. On the second day we also did lots of travelling and stopped and walked around a mosque and 2 spectacular gorges. We were glad to arrive at the desert and were welcomed with some mint tea on our arrival and then straight to our camel ride to watch the sunset. The camel ride in the dunes was amazing, the dunes were very impressive and the local berber guide for the camel ride was very knowledgeable and told us all about the animals he sees in the desert. This was the highlight of our tour. We slept in the tent and had an opportunity to sleep outside. We were told to be at breakfast at eight, at breakfast we were then informed by our guide that it was time to leave. We were confused at this as our itinerary had clearly said sandboarding in the morning which was one of the reasons we had booked this tour. Our guide said that if we had wanted to do the activity we shouldhave gotten up at five when the sand was cooler but this had not been explained to us. After discussion, our guide said that we could go off into the dunes alone to try sandboarding and found us one pair of skis between us to go and try out. This wasn't really what we had in mind as we had no idea what we were doing and were left to our own devices with one pair of skis (and no boots to fit them) between us. This was one of those 'amusingly bad' experiences. Although it was entertaining to see each other fall over on the dunes we were dissappointed to not have any guide, tutoring, or in fact boards for our sandboarding. We had emailed Moha before the trip to confirm with us that we would get the opportunity to try this activity as it may be a once in a lifetime opportunity for us. On the way back we stopped at more places to look at. Overall, we enjoyed the trip and found our guide and driver to be polite but did experience a communication barrier on a couple of occasions as we don't think our guide had understood what we had asked, and perhaps his English was slightly too limited to pass on local and historical knowledge. The dunes and the camel ride were amazing, as were the gorges en route, however we do feel that the itinerary should have been gone through with us by our guide so that everyone was clear on the activities etc. Missing out on a proper sandboarding experience was very disappointing."

Once at our destination we stopped for a meal, then Salah guided us to the summit at Ait Benhaddou. Stunning scenery and fierce heat, so remember to take plenty of water ! Lastly an hour camel ride along the dried up river bed. It felt very special coming back up towards the Kasbah as it loomed up out of the red sand. This is a long day trip (at least 6 hours in the 4x4) but was made entertaining by our hosts Salah and Rachid. We played word games, laughing both at our attempted solutions and at the antics of some of the other road users. Cost was 220 Euros for myself, wife and two teenagers.

It was excellent.I asked them to pick up my family, 2 adults, three large teenagers, at the Kasbah du Toubkal which is located at the base of the Atlas Mountains and 90kms from Marrakesch. (2 nights at this Kasbah, using a guide to go into the Toubkal National Park, highly recommended. Kasbah can arrange transfer from Marrkesch airport).Picked us up in a new, large 4x4 wheel car. With small people can fit 7, with us it was tight but comfortable. All luggage was carried on top of the car, covered with a canvas to avoid the dust and possible rain.We then drove 10 hours to M'Hamid! Our teenagers worst nightmare except that the trip was very interesting. First with the driver and guide who were from the Berber tribe and taught us a lot about the desert. Then we stopped on the way at fascinating places and locations including for lunch.Arrived at M'hamid by night only to find (to my horror) that I had booked the standard hotel (like a one star) instead of the luxury hotel (4 star). As it was my fault I asked them to take me to the 4 star note and I paid the extra charge which was not much. The luxury version of the hotel (you have to remember that M'Hamid is the last town before the deep desert was called Kazbah Azalay and we loved it. Next morning we drove for two hours into the fantastic desert. Started through a sand storm, lunch at an oasis, met berber people on the way and finally reached the impressive dunes where we camped. Moha, who is the person who organizes everything was constantly calling the team to make sure all was OK. The luxury campsite was fully booked so we had the standard campsite. We were able to look a luxury campsite on the way and were happy we got the standard. Luxury campsite si not by the really high dunes (where our kids were able to sand board!) Luxury campsite has a toilet in your tent, but personally I preferred to walk from our tents to a clean little house with several bathrooms. Our camp had approximately 20 tents, with people from all over the world. Food was good and at night we all sat around the campfire with Berber musicians entertaining us. Nights get cool but the (real ) beds in our tents had plenty of blankets. In the morning the must see thing is the sunrise. It is something out of this world. Go early and climb the highest dune for a view you will remember for the rest of your life. We only spent one night. We were able to have a camel ride that was real fun. Had we spent another night we could have explored the desert more and probably hired quads.Drove back through the amazing dried up lake and on the Paris Dakar rally trails. It is a long trip back to Marrakesch but you stop on the way and it was really worth it.I felt safe at all times. Our driver and guide were great."

It was really cool, the food was nice and the accommodation was comfortable too.I really enjoyed this trip, the best trip I've never had."

He had very short time but they arrange everything to make us comfortable and enjoy. We got the luxury accommodation which I really recommend since it is absolutely amazing! The guys who work at the desert camp are so helpful and very polite, they made everything they could to make us have a wonderful experience. Our guide Halid Arib was always very helpful and proud of his job so we really appreciate all the efforts from him. Our driver drove more than1.500 km with excellent care and attention and was always very careful and kind. This was a fantastic experience and I do recommend Top Desert to everyone who wants excellent service and very professional people during a desert trip!!!"

I was on my own but they made me feel comfortable and secure. Going through the atlas mountains was amazing and further my stay at the desert camp was great as well. It was one of my dreams to be able to sleep out in the desert and hopefully next time I can go for a longer trip."

From Marrkesh to Foum Zguid Desert, via Ait Benhaddou, overnight at the desert camp, next day, back to Marrakesh, via Oarzazate. In a word, it was amazing. Salah, our guide, was funny and very friendly (as well as fluent in every language on Earth!). Two days of the most stunning scenery imaginable, culminating with a night in the desert, including a camel ride. Star lit night, with the wind whispering over the dunes. It was a magical 48h, and we could not be happier with our experience. Take loads of bottle water, and be prepared to walk. Do it, you will not regret it!"

            "review": "Amazing 4 day (3 night) private tour from Marrakech to Erg Chigaga.. Just got back from an excellent trip with Top Desert from Marrakech to Erg Chigaga dunes camp. We're a family of 4 (children age 7&9). Our driver was Racheed who was excellent. A really good driver, so friendly & nice with the children too. He picked us up bang on time. Racheed spoke some English; enough to have little chats & find out where we were going to next etc. Those wanting historical details about the places visited might want a more fluent English speaker, but Racheed was perfect for us.Day 1 we travelled, with stops, for 11 hours. If I'd have read this before, I'd be put off but the stops are frequent and interesting, and the scenery is amazing and varied so we all found the journey fine. We visited an argan oil co-op, a couple of Kasbahs (Ait Benhaddou was excellent, great walk to top of hill, superb views - a good break from the driving). We appreciated the very quick look at the studios in Ouarzazate. Viewing from the outside was interesting enough.Riad Lamane in Zagora was brilliant - beautiful gardens etc. Wish we could have stayed longer.In fact, this bit was the only negative: Day 2, we left at 10am for a drive to M'Hamid, then hang around in a hot cafe for 3 hours waiting for it to cool down enough for the drive off road to Erg Chigaga camp. Would have been better to have an extra 2 hours at riad, (it has a pool that we had no time to use) and only stop in M'Hamid for 1 hour lunch. We had to work hard at keeping kids entertained playing cards etc at the cafe.It took nearly 3 hours of off road driving to reach camp. But it was absolutely worth it. The dunes are beautiful & I couldn't get enough of looking at them in the changing light of day/eve/night. Sandboarding was much fun. Take plenty of water - we could have done with more due to the exertion more than the heat.The camp itself was fab. We had one of about 10 tents. We had beds! And a door! Not what I expected. The marquee type communal tent was nice too, with tables & chairs. The toilets were basic as you'd expect in a desert with little/no water. Although there was a shower & sink it was very basic - take plenty of babywipes for freshening up etc. The food was good - lamb tagine one night, chicken another. Soup to start & fruit after. After dinner the fire was lit & we enjoyed 15mins of drumming & singing by the guys in the camp. Sunset was of course spent up on the dunes. Wow!Day 3 was spent chilling in the desert, as advised my Moha who we booked through. We initially wanted a 3 day trip but Moha thought the children would be better off with more time in the desert before the long car trip back. For us, this did work out best. This was largely due to the presence of a cat & 4 kittens in camp, which kept the kids entertained for hours. The morning was spent in camp, followed by several hours lazing under shade in an oasis 30 mins drive away. We had books, cards, played hopscotch etc so for us it was a nice chilled day but others might have been bored. At 5pm it was cool enough to return to camp for dromedary ride & more sandboarding. Much fun on both counts!Day 4 was the long drive back. We went a different route which was again, surprisingly interesting. We had a few stops: lunch, carpet co-op, Hills Have Eyes film location... but otherwise kept going & were back in Marrakech by 6pm.I'd really recommend top desert. Moha was pretty slick replying to queries by email before we booked. Racheed, our driver, was outstanding. Morocco itself is amazing and there is so much to see, its great to go with a company like Top Desert that take care of everything & obviously know what the are doing."

We called Moha of Top Desert on very short notice, as we wanted to take a tour to Erg Chigaga from Zagora where we were staying. He was able to put a tour together that was perfect for us two. We were picked up by our french speaking driver Hussain from our Riad in Zagora, where he took us to the stunning dunes via M'hamid. The car was a comfortable 4x4, and Hussain clearly a great driver. We arrived at the basic, 10- tent camp that was shared with other guests and other companies, but as comfortable as it gets in the middle of the desert. (They also offer a more luxurious, private camp, but we opted for the shared camp for economical reasons) We took a dromedary ride for about an hour until sunset, which was amazing. The dinner that was prepared was tasty, and the drivers and guides then played us music under the stars. Bring warm pajamas or your own sleeping bag, because it gets very cold at night! Our english speaking guide Mourad joined us between M'Hamid and Erg Chigaga, very nice guy and fun to talk to. Including tips, we paid about 2300 dirham for the two day - one night trip, and it was worth every penny."

We arranged a 3 day / 2 night tour through Top Desert from Marrakech to the Sahara. The person who handles all of the arrangements (Moha) did an excellent job of communicating and setting up the tour for us over email. At first, we were only planning a 1 night tour to the Tinfou dunes but Moha strongly suggested a 2 night tour to the Erg Chegaga dunes. This is the BEST advice we could have received. We drove past the Tinfou \"dunes\" for the 1 night tour and then I totally understood why he strongly suggested a 2 night tour or longer. I think we would have been really disappointed if we only did the 1 night tour.Our tour guide (Abdul) was absolutely amazing. We spent 3 full days with him and could not have been more happy. The first day and the last day were long days of driving including windy roads through the mountains and offroad driving in the desert. We made nice stops along the way which were very interesting to see and learn about. But for sure the highlight is the time in the desert. Abdul was absolutely fantastic and took such great care of us! It was all perfect! I cannot recommend this tour enough.One last note, my wife and I have a 1 year old child and we were very glad that we left him at home with his grandparents for this trip. It is a lot of driving including offroad driving through the desert. This was so fun for us but definitely better for couples and/or families with older children."

Yes, 12 days all over Morocco, with meet-ups in Rabat to pick up and drop off my son. I made all arrangements with Moha via e-mail. My son lives in Rabat and we are in the USA. There were quite a few places my son wanted us to visit. Moha met every challenge I gave him without a hitch and filled in the rest of our vacation with a wonderful assortment of experiences. We didn't have to worry about a thing from the time our driver picked us up at the airport until the end of our tour. They took care of every detail. All accommodations were perfect, travel arrangements were perfect, desert trip was perfect. If it had not rained in Fez, I would have guessed that Moha even arranged the weather for us!!! Moha was a most gracious person to deal with and he went out of his way to meet our requests and make us feel so welcomed in his country. Our guide and driver, Abdoul, was awesome! He was polite and helpful in every way, almost sensing our needs and yet he was never intrusive. He was knowledgeable and answered all our questions. He seemed to know exactly when we needed a break - pulling over to the side of the road for a fantastic view or to stop for a cup of tea. He was a wonderful driver as well, especially through the Atlas mountains (breath-taking views along with breath-taking curves). He recommended fantastic places to eat, shop or just take a walk. He even took us on a late night run to the store and found us some camel milk! He is such a patient person with a great sense of humor. He was always smiling! It was such a pleasure to have him with us on our journey! Moha also set us up with a local guide, Syed, in the old city of Marrakesh. Syed was great and is very knowledgeable! He explained many of the nuances of Moroccan culture and customs along with traditions and their roots. We also had a local guide in Fez.I just can't say enough about Top Desert. All of the staff we worked with were kind, generous, patient and AWESOME! They took care of everything for us. Moha always responded quickly when we were in the planning stages. We had absolutely no problems. I think we traveled about 2000km and the car (4x4) was very comfortable. Abdoul was an excellent and safe driver. All of the riads they reserved for us were great. The excursions and experiences we had will last us a lifetime!"

From Marrakech we really wanted to go into the desert but didn't have that much time. Top Desert arranged a trip that was perfect for our needs. It was easily arranged and we were taken care of the whole time. Our driver into the desert (Mahjoub) was excellent and the scenery was gorgeous. He was very friendly and we learnt so much about Moroccan culture and people. Driving through the High Atlas Mountains and seeing how Moroccans live there was unbelievable. Our time in the desert was beautiful, even though we didn't go that far into the Sahara. Everyone took care of us and it was (almost) the best accommodations of our trip, considering we were in the desert. It was a very unique experience and gave us a whole different view of Morocco. The sunset and sunrise was gorgeous and we spent the night around the campfire listening to the staff sing and play instruments. It is definitely an incredible experience that is worth trying out when visiting Morocco. I would recommend going farther into the desert and taking two to three days if you want a more real experience of the desert. I would definitely go again with Top Desert and I hope to do so again in the future. They have many options available and are happy to help you find the right one for you."

Moha responded to our questions in a timely manner and arranged for us to be collected at the airport in Marrakech and driven to our riad.

Once we saw where the riad was, right in the middle of the Medina, we quickly understood why! Moha also arranged a separate guide, Said, who guided us around the Medina for the only afternoon we had available in Marrakech. He was a wealth of knowledge and looked after our every need and we felt very safe with him. He also showed us how to find our way to and from our riad, at our request, and we would highly recommend Said to anyone who wanted to hear about some of the history of Marrakech. Thank you Said!We would really like to thank Abdoul (our driver) & Mourad (our guide) who were very kind and caring during our 3 day trip to the dunes.

We had an excellent time with our great guides, Abdoul and Majoub (2 comfy aircon cars) who accommodated many photo stops. They turned up at our Riad on time and returned us efficiently to a well hidden riad on our return to Marrakech.The journey south took us through fantastic scenery and we ate typical tasty Moroccan food. We over nighted in a secluded desert camp site (south of Foum-Zguid), accessed by camel ride into the sunset.A simple meal was followed by a berber jam session, with a bit of Les Mis from our kids. We slept under the stunning desert stars as the tents were too hot, although our concerns of night crawlers were not realised. Be aware of the sand getting under the sheets though if the wind picks up! We all watched the sunrise whilst attempting dune surfing, followed by a second camel trek as the sun rose further over the mountains. Breakfast, showers and a swim at a nearby hotel was greatly appreciated.The outward trip over the high Atlas mountains visited the remote but beautiful Kazbah Des Glaoui at Telouet, still decked in stunning original mosaic (similar to India's Agra style), not expected from the outside image of a semi ruin. The return trip took us through scenery as stunning as the Utah desert. Our short trip did not allow an extended visit to Ait Ben Haddou although we passed by and stopped for lunch. 2 other stops allowed for rug buying and Argan oil testing.Thank you to Abdoul and Majoub for an exciting and cultural trip!"

            "review": "Wonderful experience. When we decided to go on vacation to Morocco, we wanted to see the desert. After a long time surfing on the internet we booked our 4 day trip to the desert with Top Desert. There are so many tour operators who offer you trips to the Sahara what makes it difficult to pick one. When we planned our vacation to Morocco and the excursion we had some questions, and Moha helped us by email before we booked our desert trip. That gave us a very good idea about the organisation. They helped you wherever they could.Abdoul was our driver and guide during the four days and we liked him all very much. Great sence of humour, a perfect driver and he thought a lot about the wishes of our four children! He told us a lot about Morocco, his culture and living in the desert. He knew the most beautiful views for the photo's and he showed us a lot of amazing places.Near Erg Chebbi, we stopped at a well where the children could get water for the camels to drink, they were resting in the sun. It was a magnificent and refreshing moment! Now we are back home, one of the best memories left of our wonderful vacation.The camel ride to see the sunset, the colours of the Sahara, sleeping under the stars and even a little sandstorm made our desert experience complete and very special. It was a magical evening and night in the desert. Abdoul, his colleague Lachzen and some boys who work their made Berber music for us, and we tried to played some instruments and although we have to confess we are bad musicians, we joined and made a lot of fun, and even learned a Berber dance, It was a perfect evening in the desert.We are so glad that we chose Top Desert! The tour was perfect and everything was organised well! We love this beautiful country so much, and all the nice people and their culture. We really hope to come back to Morocco again and to discover more of it. Without a second thought we will book a tour by Top Desert again !!!!Abdoul, thanks again, we will never forget this wonderful trip!"

Even though I was a solo traveller, and he couldn't find another group for me to go with, he arranged a private trip for me within my budget. I was worried about my safety since I was traveling alone so he personally came to the Riad I was staying at to explain everything to me. He made me feel so comfortable which was a breath of fresh air after how I was treated by the taxistas, people in the Souks and in the streets of Marrakesh. He arranged for his brother Rachid to take me on the 3 day tour to the desert and back, door to door service. Rachid was amazing! He stopped at all the great places to take pictures and he always had my comfort and well-being in mind. He speaks several languages (Berber, Arabic, French and Spanish) and was well-versed in the areas we travelled through. After going through several cool cities and seeing century old Kasbahs, we arrived to the Gorges du Dades and stayed the night at the lovely Albuerge Chez Pierre. The people there were equally kind to me and the meals were fabulous! The next day, when we arrived at the desert, the people Rachid and Abdu work with were so also nice and hospitable. I was so impressed with the sheer beauty and serenity of the area. Everything everybody says about this particular 3-day trip is true, so many gorgeous things to see and eat! I would HIGHLY recommend this tour with Rachid and/or Abdu without a single doubt in my mind! I loved every single minute of it and am so glad I chose them!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~On another note, after telling Rachid all about my bad experiences walking around Marrakesh alone, he accompanied me everywhere! I am so incredibly thankful for what I consider \"special treatment\" because it renewed my faith in the people and diminished every single awful experience I had. Wonderful, exceptional treatment like none other, thank you SO much for everything guys!"

They met me the night before we left at my hotel and we discussed plans, concerns, and travel arrangements. They picked me up the next day in a beautiful Land Rover. Their English is great for discussing the country and culture. We travelled a long distance to the first town, where we had beautiful accomodations in a gorgeous riad. The second day we went into the heart of the desert and stayed at a magical tent camp with delicious food and memories I'll never forget. Halfway through the trip, I realized I was no longer traveling alone... I was traveling with friends. These 2 guys, Moha and Abdou, are amazing... good friends who have gone in together to create a top notch business that provides a magical experience for their customers. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. We would stop on the way when we'd see something neat on the side of the road. I'd recommend this company to anyone and can't wait until I can get back to Morocco so I can book another adventure with them. Highly, highly recommended!"

We travelled on a small relatively well air conditioned mini bus with 9 other people and our guide. The trip to the desert took 12 hours by bus and 2 hours on a camel. The journey out to the desert involved many stops to take pictures and for toilet breaks. On arrival to the desert we were welcomed with mint tea and a lovely tagine supper. We then spent hours lying under the stars before heading to sleep in our tent which we shared with another couple. We visited in June and at night the desert was still really hot and the temperature in our tent was quite uncomfortable, so don't worry about taking warm clothing with you. We woke at 6am to watch a beautiful sunrise and then headed back on the camels for one hour where we met the main road and our guide was waiting for us. The journey home took approximately 6 hours. All the roads to and from Zagora are very winding and I would recommend anti sickness for anyone who suffers from travel sickness. There are lots of opportunities to buy water along the way, and it's not necessary to purchase a cloth to wear as a head scarf when riding the camels, regardless of how much it is insisted on. Overall this was an absolutely amazing trip and I would recommend it to everyone as a must do tour whilt in morocco."

We created our own tour with Tenere, they made an itinerary at a great prices within a few hours, which allowed us to see everything we wanted to in Morocco. They even made suggestions throughout our trip to give us a better experience based off of the things we were enjoying the most throughout the tour. They were super accommodating to make changes while we were there to have less time in cities and more time in the desert. Our accommodations were great, everything was clean and everyone was so welcoming. The desert trip was outstanding, the camp was gorgeous, and the camel rides were definitely the highlight of our trip. We saw so much more culture than we ever thought we would, we felt like we really got an authentic experience with Tenere. My parents were super apprehensive to go to Morocco, but they loved it, it was the best vacation we have been on. For us what really made our trip special was our driver Ali. He was so genuine and amazing, he made sure we always were enjoying the trip, and that we were seeing everything we wanted to see! We truly feel he made the trip for us, and feel so lucky to have had him with us the whole 10 days ! The only thing my mom suggested was that we have a crash course on who to tip and how much we tip them. But, we also could have asked !Overall i highly recommend travelling with Tenere, Its the best travel experience i've ever had."

We had a few cities and sites in our mind and hence, we sent our requests for private customised tour via email to different companies. Tenere Tours responded in a matter of minutes, with the full itinerary with other must-go sites that we have missed. The most importantly, they offered a great price! Rachid was very helpful and quick in answering questions. With his help, our application for Morocco Visa went well. We arrived at Marrakech Airport on the same day but different time (5 in the morning and 1 in the evening), yet Rachid and Ali went twice to pick us all up to our riad and helped us in settling down. With a skillful driver (Ali) and a hospitable tour guide (Rachid), we travelled in a really comfortable way on a mini van through Marrakesh, Essaouira, Ouarzazate, Merzouga, Arfoud, Fes and others. They would tell us stories and histories about the cities, stopping at different spots for nice panoramic views and photo-taking session, and sometimes throwing us with jokes. The whole journey was full of laughter and we got close really quickly. Something worth mentioning was that, they would celebrate the Islamic festival (Eid Al-Adha) on 12th of September, 2016, and because of this, we had the chance to explore a few authentic local markets that were really busy with people trying to get ready for their big festival, buying and selling goats, sheeps and other spices. The stop at the market on our way from Marrakech to Essaouira was quite random, but in my opinion was the best part of the trip!! Buzzing through the crowd, observing the locals' way of living, their culture, religion, food... EVERYTHING! That was AMAZING!!Throughout the journey, I was amazed by the various landscapes in Morocco. Dry land with cactus; ground with troves of marine fossils; mountains of different colour (red, brown or black); Sahara deserts with shrubs; national park with trees just like those in tropical country (My hometown: Malaysia!). Moroccan cuisine such as tagine, couscous, zaalouk, b'stilla, all tasted amazing! They are not spicy and hence, no worries. Their mint tea was refreshing and I think I am addicted to it (they called it Moroccan whiskey with zero alcohol, LOL!!) Rachid recommended us to local restaurants with tasty food at a reasonable price. He even helped us to bargain as we do have language barrier with the locals. The accommodation arranged by Rachid was brilliant. The staffs at the hotels and haimas were all helpful and warming, greeting us with smiles and always welcome us with their mint tea. Breakfasts were included and the hotels are all at the right spots, allowing us to walk around and explore the town by ourselves. The night in sahara was lively with their traditional musics, songs and board game. Rachid was a really responsible tour guide. When one of my friends fell sick in Sahara desert (probably due to motion sickness after riding the camel, or maybe because of the heat), he rushed to us, took good care of my friend, and stayed all night with us. His sincerity in making friends and his generosity show us the best side and also the beauty of Morocco. Once again, thanks a lot for the trip of a lifetime!!!!! We highly recommend this company to anyone.  Tips: - Travel in a larger group comes a better price. - Ask for permission if you would like to take photos of their stalls, or else you might end up being scolded."

Hassan replied to our email in a matter of minutes and he helped organize the tour and later, when we arrived late to Marrakech due to a delay in the airport, his brother Rashid picked us up and personally took us to our beautiful Riad. Despite it being very late in the evening, Rashid sat down with us, and while sharing tea, got to know us and reviewed what we wanted to do over the course of the 9 days- very professional and courteous. He introduced us to our driver Ali, who was responsible for taking us to our sites throughout the country. Ali was super friendly, knowledgeable, generous and most importantly accommodating. My wife and I weren't interested in waking up too early in the morning, so Ali would come and pick us up at 9:30/10:00. When we had to be at the port of Tangier early in the AM, Ali was ready at 4:30AM. We went during Ramadan, and despite not eating/drinking anything for the entire day, Ali was always cheerful, helpful, knowledgeable and engaging. We got to learn so much more about the culture, history and traditions just by being with him for the entire tour. In addition, we met professional and certified tour guides in each major city (Marrakesh, Fez, even the dessert), who taught us a great deal and even bargained for us! Our two nights in the desert were unforgettable. We rode camels, drove over the duns, visited Berber and Bedouin families, enjoyed traditional Berber music under the desert ski and enjoyed incredible service. While on the road, we crossed paths with Rashid and a tourist from Chile. Rashid stop his car, came and greeted us and even the tourist got out of the car to say hello.

He always responded very quickly to emails and was easy to correspond with the entire time, making sure that we were getting exactly what we had in mind for our trip. Even when I arrived and got delayed in the airport, I reached out to Rachid and he was quick to calm my worries and make us feel comfortable before we even stepped out of the airport. As if Rachid hadn't already impressed us enough, our tour guide Hassan made our 2 week adventure even better. He was always very prompt, made sure we always had what we needed, answered any questions we had along the way, provided advice along the way that helped make our experience the very best, and of course kept us safe as we traveled from Casablanca to Rabat, to Chefchaouen, to Fes, to the Sahara, to Essouira, and finally to Marrakech. It was like we were traveling with a friend, which made the experience all the more fun and comfortable the entire time. Not to mention, Hassan is well versed in several languages, which makes him that much more approachable and capable of connecting with people from around the world. I think its not only impressive, but a huge asset for travelers who come from different places around the world. All in all, Tenere Tours, especially Hassan as our guide, made our Morocco adventure outstanding and my favorite travel experience yet. I did a lot of research before booking and I have no doubt in my mind that these are the best guys to see Morocco with. If you are debating about booking, DO IT! You won't regret.

Rashid ( who helped us organizing and also was our guide for our 10 day trip), was extremely responsive to all our questions and flexible with our requests. He designed a trip to ensure we would experience pretty much everything this Country has to offer : mountains, desert, beaches, good food, music, chaotic cities, charming towns and very nice people. We were able to appreciate and learn about their culture, way of leaving, religion, history and food. We drove a little less of 2,500 kms for 10 days. Their 4x4 SUVs are in good condition and they know the roads very well. Roads are a mixed of good highways and more local roads. We were 3 adults, and as we had a driver & a guide the 3 of us had to share the back seat, this is something to consider depending on who is traveling. We travel during the month of Ramadan. 2 advantages: first, you get to see in deep how they live this month and the importance of the religion in their culture; also, I understand is a less \"touristy' time, so there is less congestion. The only downfall is that most of the good restaurants in the big cities are not open for lunch, and at night if you are an early bird (like we are), you have to wait after 8 pm to get served in many places. The only thing that I would do different, is maybe go a little more upscale in the hotels. In general they are decent and clean, good service and food, but having been there, I now think with a little more money is worth the upgrade. If you travel during the summer sunblock, sunglasses and a good hat is a must! We reached temperatures over 45 Celsius in the desert. Overall we had a great experience, and left Morocco feeling is a Country rich in culture and history, with very kind people that understand the important role that tourism plays in their economy. Both Rashid and Hassan were very attentive, punctual, organized. Always making sure we were having a great time! They are fun to travel with and very knowledgeable of their culture and Country."

Luckly, weeks before, 3 of my friends and i found a chance to visit Morocco in our final year summer vacation and we had planned to visit this mysterious country for so long and fortunately we found Tenere Local Tours as our priority. The tour took us for 6 days, we acrossed and visited the places from Marrakech to Sahara Desert and then to Fes. Although the date of the trip was not quite enough as we have other schedule to go after 29/5, Rachid Ait Khouya (The local tour guy from Tenere Tours) compressed the trip with keeping the most important attractiones for us. Also, he brought us to visit the local market that 4 of us were only Asian in there which was quite weired lol. Overall, high recommend for Tenere Tour if any of you visit Morcocco as the price and the quality of the service are so cheap and professional. Lastly,Thank you again Rachid Ait Khouya for treating us as your family members and thank you for all the memories in the trip. Hoping that we can meet you soon in the future, my friend. Leo"

And our trip via camel into the desert camp was probably the highlight. The camp was just fabulous with electricity, hot and cold running water, flushing toilets and a standup shower!

One difference is Tenere is a lot cheaper and I was worried there was something awry. Lucky we took the punt, we had an awesome time! Rachid was our host of a group of 11 guys and gals in their late 20s-late 30s (mostly Aussies) and we loved it. We started in Marrakech and made our way to the Sahara and back seeing the Atlas Mountains and a number of unesco sites on the way. My only criticism is that there is a fair amount of time on the road but that's no fault of the Tenere, it's just the way of the land. I am also unsure how different a 3 day vs 4 day (we did the 4 day) tour as we had mates do a 3 day and they did most of our highlights. Either way, the Sahara is phenomenal and not to be missed, definitely the highlight of Morocco. Rachid as a tour guide is hilarious too, couldnt ask for a better guide, definitely makes a difference."

We saw all these amazing sites, little towns, Atlas mountains, to camping in the Sahara desert, stopping for a night in the Dades Gorge, and the big cities of Fez and Casablanca to the fascinating inner ancient & active Medina's that thrive within these modern cities.First, you have to visit Morocco. It's truly unique, and the hospitality across the country is fantastic. Everyone was so nice! We've traveled to many places around the world (Singapore, Turkey, Egypt, all over Europe, all over Mexico, all over the Caribbean, U.S, Canada, etc...), all worth visiting, but this Morocco trip really stands out.Second, you have to use Hassan's team.

Most of us are Bulgarians,but we have a Czech guy and a Swiss girl in the group as well. In this episode, we decide to go somewhere for New Year and spent a few days there. Fast forward a few episodes. We've had numerous arguments and debates about the dates, places, length of the trip and so on. We've settled for 3-5 days after the 3rd of January, and we're deciding mainly between Morocco and Russia. After final look at the offers we have, we choose Morocco. 8 of us are going, between the 3rd and the 7th. The agency-Tenere Tours Morocco. The guide-the main protagonist in the series-Rachid! And the second part of the TV season is like an ecranisation of \"One Thousand and One Nights\". Beautiful old cities and villages, busy markets, where you forge bargains with the merchants for their handcrafted treasures, places where movies like \"The Mummy\", \"Laurence of Arabia\", \"Gladiator\" and \"Babel\" were shot, \"Game of Thrones\" scenes as well, smiling and frienly people... At least two episodes have to be dedicated to the desert camp trip and the night spend there. Never have I seen so many stars n the sky, and the drum party organised by our hosts was mesmerising, pure magic! From the largest North African palm grove to the UNESCO cite of Ait Ben Haddou, from Marrakech to Sahara, this was a maginificent journey. And it wouldn't have been even close to this without Rachid and this agency. They knew all the best places, wanted us to see everything possible, while having fun at the same time. And we met iterally hundreds of people, who knew Rachid and greeted him warmly, made discounts for us and so on. The untainted luxury in the hotels and the desert camp was beyond our imagination, when we paid for the trip. We were often wondering how did we manage to get all of this so cheap. Grab warm clothes for the winter, and go for the adventure of your life! And we're already thinking about the second season of our much beloved \"Everybody Loves Rachid\" series! ^^"

Having had the opportunity to visit this beautiful country back in 2006, I didn't think the private group tour we had booked would show me anything I hadn't already experienced previously but I was proved wrong! From the start, our guide (Rachid) was extremely friendly, personable and always on hand to answer any queries we had. We were shown plenty of amazing sights and delights along the way, as well as spots off the beaten track that only a local would know. He made me see these places in a whole new light and reinvigorate my interest in destinations that I had visited already.One of the highlights for me was the trek into the Sahara desert on the camels and spending a night in a nomadic Berber camp watching the sunset and moon rising as well as singing and dancing around the camp fire well into the night! Rachid's jovial nature added a light-hearted mood to our tour experience which suited our group very well - he was so easy to get along with and was always there if we needed any assistance. He is multi-lingual and was happy to even let me practise my limited Spanish on him throughout the tour! :)Highly recommend Rachid and Tenere Tour Morocco to anyone wanting to gain a wonderful insight into an amazing country and its people, culture, food and lifestyle.

We met Ali from Tenere Tours in Marrakech and drove down to Ait Ben Haddou to meet up with Rachid in a private car. Rachid and Ali were not only excellent tour guides who were very knowledgeable about all aspects of Moroccan culture and destinations but they were also extremely easy and pleasant to be around. We instantly liked them both and felt like we could trust them. We wanted to get out of the cities and touristy areas and that is what we did! Rachid took us to his small Berber village in the middle of the desert and into other local market places and villages that really gave us a taste of real Moroccan life. After our tour was scheduled to end we asked Rachid if he could take us on for another 5 days as we really appreciated his knowledge of the country and trusted his taste. We highly recommend Rachid at Tenere Tours and really think he is the best guy for the job!"

The tour guides picked up my group directly from the gate at the airport and off we went. Our primary tour guide, Rashid, was the best. A local of the entire region, he was able to point out and recommend the best places for everything, including points of interest, photo opportunities, and fabulous food. The guides were a blast, keeping the trip fun and exciting. They remained flexible by letting us stop anywhere we asked.In conclusion, Morocco is a wonderful place. Everywhere the tour took us to was great and a lot of fun. The hotels where awesome, the towns and markets are a portal to another world, and the mighty Sahara itself was grand. Tenere Tours, thank you for the wonderful memories, I can't wait to go back."

We went for almost five days, we went to a lot of places, one of my favorite ones was the dessert, sleeping in there was an incredible experience. You have the chance to meet so many people, people with a completely different way of thinking that it makes you start seeing live in a totally different way. Besides the beautiful places we met, the experience was completed with beautiful people such as Rachid and Hassan, I can't explain the amazing time we had together, we became friends in matter of days.There's something I can totally say.

Morocco is something that everyone should experience but having the right guides could make or break the experience. I am not one to typiclly hire a guide while on vacation but I've changed my mindset on that after our experience with Arenas 4x4. They personalized the tour in everyway to where we went and how long we needed at each stop. Everything from great food, cultural insights and the best jokes we are still telling.Thanks for an incredible expereince in the Sahara!"

Look no further than the crew at Tenere Tours Morocco for proof! Our amazing guide, Rachid, took us from Marrakech to the Sahara and back, not only stopping at all of our predetermined sites, but taking the time to share the hidden wonders as well. From ancient Casbahs and traditional, African cultural centers to Beduin tribes and local markets, we experienced things you won't read about in any guidebook. Things that would only have been possible with the assistance of an experienced and knowledgeable guide. With Rachid no request was too great, and no question went unanswered. We traveled in comfort and safety, and with Rachid the time spent in transit was nearly as entertaining as the time spent exploring.You could certainly explore Morocco on your own, but why would you want to when you can arrange an infinitely customizable, efficient and affordable guide from Tenere Tours Morocco? I'll never visit Morocco without their assistance, and I can't recommend their service enough for inexperienced and experienced travelers alike."

So after a few days of soaking up the sun, my partner and I were ready to peel ourselves away from our sun beds and do something a bit more active! It was incredibly easy to book and pay (we paid online in advance) and Dunes & Desert provided all the information we needed ahead of time - pick up location, what to wear etc. The location, a dam built in the 1930s, is beautiful - the backdrop of the Atlas Mountains is so tranquil. Our guide, Mark, who runs the company, was incredibly warm and welcoming and instantly put us all at ease. We changed (you have to embrace wearing crocs!) and after some instruction, we hit the water. We'd never been paddle boarding before, but it's really easy for beginners to pick up, especially on such a calm lake, and Mark made it fun for everyone - even jumping in too when we all started to fall in (be prepared to get a bit wet and remember to bring some dry clothes!)After an hour or so of enjoying the scenery, we stopped off on a small island for a special treat, involving traditionally made mint tea (which is more difficult to make than you'd think!) - it was a lovely touch and showed real thought has gone into making the experience special.We returned to the water, and spent some time paddling out to look at some of the local wildlife - including an eagle. We then headed back to base to get changed and found a delicious lunch waiting for us, which was much appreciated after our time on the lake. All the food is included in the price of the experience, you just need to pay for drinks - we highly recommend the rose wine, it's great with the food and the sun!Overall, it was a great day, and we can't recommend this highly enough. Mark is a born host, who genuinely knows and loves the area - it's an enthusiasm which is completely infectious! We would have given this six stars if we could."

Unlike some other companies around there with this tour you really get to ride in a desert as suppose to right outside a suburb. The tea break felt authentic and the people at the Berber house were nice as well. The reason for the 4 instead of a 5 is because it was impossible to reach them to confirm pick up location as I was in the medina. It is stressful when you cannot communicate and wonder if you got scammed... But the driver was there on time at my hotel, so no big deal at the end of the day...I do wish I was told that your clothes ... And pretty much everything you bring gets including yourself will be covered in thick dust. It was amazing fun but do not bring anything you care about except family members or friends of course. They do offer a picture service and did a good job at it."

It was so easy to book and very well priced for everything we got! Highly recommend doing this experience.We were picked up outside our Riad and driven in a nice air conditioned van into the Atlas mountains where we were greeted by the most incredible view and nicest staff. We were fitted out with equipment which looked close to new and given a lesson on how to actually do stand up paddle boarding! The lesson must have been good considering it was both our first time and neither of us fell in.We were taken around the lake in the Atlas Mountains and stopped once for mint tea, where we were showed exactly how this was authentically made in Morocco, and other times where we relaxed on the boards and enjoyed the views. Once we were back on shore, a feast was prepared at the restaurant overlooking the lake. The meal at that restaurant is reason alone to do this experience, the actual paddle boarding is a bonus!A special thanks has to go to Mark who was our guide for the day and really went out of his way to ensure that we were both comfortable on the boards and having a great time. He showed this at the end of the day when he took us out in his own car over the dunes in the desert as we wanted to see it, something he definitely didn't have to do. It is also worth noting that he takes his Go Pro camera with him and takes pictures of you and emails you them all free of charge. Mark really made this day incredible for us and is a brilliant example of how great the staff are at Dunes and Desert."

We sent them an email, and they replied swiftly with details and prices. They're so good in arranging transport back and forth from where you're staying or close to it. Its all included in the prices. They have 2 options for timing, we went for the 9 o'clock take off, the weather was still great, not too hot. We wanted the quad biking only. I think this is the best activity to go with your mates. It was 4 of us, the driver was on time waiting for us, picked us up, then we travelled to pick up a french couple from another place then headed towards the desert, where we found the base, quad bikes, buggy cars, camels. The staff nice and welcoming, they speak in Arabic, French or English. They give a quick head up about whats going on, you have to sign a piece of paper that you agree to the risks etc. They have lockers to put your stuff in. They provide you with helmet. Then they give a brief lesson about how to drive a quad bike, every group has a guide. we felt we are lucky coz our group is made up of 5 bikes, with guide its 6. so the biggest at that day, they rest they were either 2 or 3. I felt it was quite fun to be chasing a bigger group and wait for each other. the first 10 mins was a warm up, the guide keeps an eye on you, then choose who will go behind and last. Then the journey starts, into the deep desert, into highways, in the middle of no where. 2 and a half hours of fun and thrill. during that time, there was a planned 3 stops, 1st one is to take a professional photo by their own photographer, which at the end if you want it, you can pay 50dhs \u00a34 for the copy, or you can ask them to send it via email for similar price.Then the second stop is on a hill, great view, they give you cold water, we met up with other people and had a good laugh. we continued the drive until we got to the place where they have a tent, and they offer you a snack, tea with pastry and honey(looks like crepe) , it was just delicious. Then, we headed back to base. It was just well organised, very caring guides, easy going, great adventure overall, wouldn't expect more from it."

We were picked up really close to where we were staying (couldn't get a van where we were staying) and were transported to the site. We were taken to a shaded area and given water, had some h&s forms to fill in and then all had our cheche scarfs put on. We then mounted the camels, 45 min or so to a berber house where we had mint tea and a snack. Delicious and fun! Then it was around 30 min or so back. The guides were entertaining and friendly. Constant supply of water as and when needed. They were happy to take photos along the way (with your camera, plus they had a company camera, and there was a professional photographer whom you could purchase photos off at the end). Once back, we had some more water, the option to purchase photos, and then were transported back to the point we were picked up from. It was a fun, picturesque and interesting trip and we were so glad we did it.My tip: It was so hot it didn't matter if you were covered up or not in terms of how much you sweat, but I would recommend covering up, there was no shade and it helps you stop getting burnt (I wore a linen shirt and light walking trousers). All in all a great trip, loved the camels (especially Madonna, my camel!), the guides were great, staff helpful. Would recommend!"

It looked good from the pictures and we really liked the sound of it. We were picked up and taken to meet up with our guide Jerome at lake Lalla Takerkoust in south Morocco, roughly around 45 minutes from Marrakech. The lake was a beautiful sight and very peaceful in the early morning. The paddle boarding was really good fun, you can go at your own pace over the lake whilst taking in a timid peaceful environment, with plenty of time to enjoy the views. We paddle boarded over the lake and as far possible down the river we could (this time of year the river has dried up a little however this did not affect the experience at all!). We stopped mid-morning for some Morrocan bread at a local persons garden, which was a great experience and then made our way back to where we began. This was around 14:00 where we could get cleaned down and changed in to our spare clothes ready for the lunch also included in the trip, which we enjoyed!Our guide Jerome is a really nice person and goes out of his way to make your day the most it can be. He took many pictures on his waterproof camera which he sent via email once we were home, free of charge. He enjoyed lunch with us and gave us more recommendations on places to eat, visit and transport services, if i went back i would like to meet him again!Thanks for a wonderful trip Jerome!Tom and Emma :)FYI - Dunes and desert have a facebook page with plenty of photos of this trip and all the other excursions they do!"

We then got split up into smaller groups, we were with 2 other people (4 of us altogether) but after maybe 10/15 mins, another of the staff members let my boyfriend and I go with him as he could see that we were 'very good' on the quads :) this made the experience absolutely INCREDIBLE!

Quad biking and camel riding on the same day is just brilliant. You get to meet so many different people from all walks of life and just enjoy a once in a lifetime experience in the desert together. Will recommend this particular excursion to everyone I know visiting Morocco. A few tips... bring shades, wear comfy clothes - you will get dusty, probably a good idea to book a hammam afterwards! Bring a camera but they do send you good quality pictures by email too. The instructor goes at your pace and although you are thrown in the deep end, they make sure you are comfortable riding the vehicle safely. The camels are nothing to be scared of, they are really clever and well looked after! Don't bother booking with cheaper agencies this one is the best! You are well fed, entertained and well equipped."

Everything was so well organised, we were picked up on time from our hotel in Marrakech, the bus journey was about an hour when we got there we were given traditional Moroccan tea, and a glass of water and someone sat down and explained what was going to happen to us, they spoke English, Arabic and French.We were then given traditional Moroccan scarves which they tied for us and given lockers to leave our bags in, in the middle of our camel ride we stopped at a Berber village for mint tea and yummy honey pancakes, everyone was so polite and welcoming. When we returned we were again offered tea and water and they have emailed us all the professional photos that were taken. Most wonderful experience."

Once we booked we were given full details and arrangements for pick up. Not only did they collect on time we had a phone call from their office telling us what minibus was picking us up.On arrival we were greeted by happy friendly staff offering us water after the short 30 minute transfer. Once the family was kitted out and the safety briefing was finished we set off following our guide. The whole experience was amazing as we passed local villages before stopping for a break. After the next leg we stopped outside a village and sat down to drink tea in the shade before exploring a locals house. If you are thinking about a trip this is a must and totally safe for your children as long as you drive safely.A big thanks to the great team who make this excursion such great fun."

The guide was fantastic and made sure we were always safe, but he didn't do this by making us go at snail speed. The pace was perfect, the terrain was magical and the experience was phenomenal! A definitely highlight of my trip to Morocco.It is great that they always have a maximum of 4 people per guide - so that way it doesn't get overcrowded and you're not waiting around for many people. The food and tea at the village completely hit the spot too.The tour we did was during ramadan and I don't know how the guides managed to not even drink any water or eat throughout! But it did not impact our experience at all.I would definitely recommend this to any and everyone travelling to Morocco. Next time I'd like to do the longer trips with the them!"

            "review": "Unforgettable Experience. The overall experience was amazing. We were a group of four and were picked up by an arranged transport (by dunes&desert exploration) from outside of our Riad in Marrakech. When we got to the base in the middle of the desert we had to fill up info forms for formality etc.After the whole induction thing we were clothed by the staff with a desert head scarf to protect us from the heat (looks awesome). Photos were then taken as a souvenir and you have the option of buying any official photos taken after the whole activity. First activity was a camel ride that takes you to the Berber village where you get a delicious snack of Moroccan pancakes and mint tea! The berber people provided a short entertainment of singing (as authentic as you can get). Camel ride back to the base after this. Quad biking takes up half of the day as the first session takes you back to the berber village for lunch (salad, bread, tajine and mint tea). After lunch there is nap time!!! You'd think it'd be roasting to take a nap in the middle of the desert but it was actually very breezy and the silence will put you right to sleep. Second part of the quad bike then takes you near the foot of the mountains...we stopped over to absorb the view and have a drink of water. It was then the quad bike trip back to the base.It's one of the experiences I will never forget. The staff are very helpful and takes care of you in all ways they can. To mention a few, Rasheed, Hamid and are really nice and welcoming. If you are going to Morocco make sure you do take on this dunes&desert experience as it will give you the real taste of morocco. The price for the camel ride and quad bike is very much worth it."

There's a break for water about 1/3 way through and another break at a remote house about 2/3 way through where they have carpets and shelter laid out in the sand and have tea and crepes laid on.

The van picked us up promptly and we were off to the location for the start of our ride. The welcome from the starting point was lovely too and it was the beginning of a great journey because we met a lovely couple who loved to travel. They provided shesh for everyone to wear to protect our heads from the sun. The one hour ride to the village as fairly comfortable as long as you shifted yourself in the saddle every 5 or so minutes. We were entertained with lots of songs and photos in between. Aziz, one of the guides also made us crafty camel rings he weaved using palm leaves. TIP: make sure to wear trousers when going on the camel ride! and no need to bring water bottles since they provide water and cups for the whole group.Once we got to the village, the family was very welcoming and we got to have some mint tea (which I adore, considering I do not drink tea at all) and some moroccan pancakes with honey and sesame seeds. While having tea, we were entertained with some local songs accompanied by drums and you got to participate by clapping along to the beat. The camel ride back was a lot faster. Although we weren't too keen on Aziz's suggestion to get the camels to a gallop, we enjoyed the journey back to the base, where we returned the shesh and grabbed our belongings that we placed in a locker provided. But the most wonderful service happened after the camel ride experience. We got dropped off at Jemaa al Fna with the van. It was silly of me but I dropped my mobile phone in the van and realized it several minutes after we got dropped off. I rang the company straight away and they were very helpful in taking in notes about my phone and told me they will contact me once they have heard back from the van driver if he saw my phone. Several minutes after and by God's grace through kind people, the company rang back to say they have found my phone and can return it at the same meeting place within 15 minutes. The van driver gave me back my phone and he refused the tip I wanted to give him, but I insisted he take it as a thank you for his kind act. I am very thankful for that kind person for returning my phone. God truly works in mysterious ways.Thank you for the lovely experience!"

            "review": "Camel/Quad Combo = FUN Day in Marrakech. This is a great company that I definitely plan on using during my next visit to Marrakech. Firstly, our pick up was scheduled for 8:45am and a fully air-conditioned van pulled up to our location at 8:45am. That NEVER happens with these types of excursions; they're usually late or you're suffocating the entire ride. D&D is located a short 20-30 minutes from the square so you're not wasting precious vacation time getting there either.I did the Camel/Quad combo and we started with the camel ride. The camels are friendly and amusing so, as long as you hold on when they tell you, you'll have a fun and unique experience. The guides were hilarious and had very good relationships with the camels. The crepes and mint tea we received were the best I've ever had. I'll be chasing that meal for the rest of my travelling life.The trip back was much like the trip there so I will skip ahead to the Quads. We got a safety and instruction brief and were off in no time. The only downfall of the day (which is a first world complaint like no other) is that we headed back to the house where we previously ate way to soon after our initial visit. We had an amazing lunch but couldn't enjoy it as much because we were so full from our amazing breakfast. The tagine was DELICIOUS; seriously, the best! Our quad ride was long but not too long. It was enough to let loose on the bikes and have a great time in a beautiful atmosphere. We stopped for a water and photo-op break in a peaceful and picturesque location.A photographer is there throughout your visit to capture your experience. Afterwards, some free pictures are posted to their FB and there are also some great shots available for sale (bring cash - Dirham - for these). I never buy pictures from anywhere but there were 2 shots that I couldn't leave without. D&D did not disappoint. I'll be back!"

However it was not the experience of a lifetime that many other reviewers posted about. The company is very professional and provide the services as expected. However it should be noted that the Agafay desert is very commercialized and has many farms. It is about a 20 to 30-minute drive from Marrakesh. The experience also depends on the type of people you go with in your group.thus everyone experience can be different. I would pick either the camel ride or the ATV not both. The camel ride is quite fun and exciting the first 10 minutes however many other people felt it was too long. The ATV was fun but not a unique experience like the camel ride."

The camel ride was great though could have covered more interesting areas The quads were well maintained and great fun, once again too much time on flat open terrain-more interesting routes needed. Previously we visited Marrakech and took quads into the Atlas Mountains, across a variety of terrain including villages etc which was really interesting, this we found a bit of a boring route without any challenges other than the final part where we were taken into sand dunes for about ten minutes riding into chicanes -that was great fun. The people were fun and appeared to enjoy our company which must be tough for them doing this all day every day I guess, but you'd never know it, they were happy and accommodating -typical of Marrakech people; full of respect and a pleasure to spend time with. All in all a good day out be aware the camel ride is fairly long and particularly the guys may end up walking like John Wayne by the end of it!!!"

It was a excellent experience driving along the rocky dunes in the desert and arriving at Saida's authentic three generations Berber house. She was thoughtful and caring and had a phenomenal spirit! The hike to the Berber village was not the easiest, but the view surely made up for it. Finally the home cooked meal after the hike was absolutely delicious - honestly one of my favourite meals in Morocco. What beats eating fresh produce as you gaze into the farm it's grown? I would definitely recommend this trip, for the view, the experience, and the food!"

FWIW, if you know much about car, bike, or chassis dynamics you're going to want to have way more fun on these things than the guides will let you; that's probably a good thing. The ATV's we took out were automatics but produced enough torque for plenty of power oversteer and took the hills like champs. The scenery was out of this world ranging from semi-arid hills and valleys to proper dessert to forested areas around the lake. This is an outstanding tour for photographers as you get diverse landscapes and even (if you're crazy) some pretty sweet action shots. Don't forget to bring a GoPro!"

Given a talk through of how to operate a quad bike and then taken for a small ride so we could get to grips with it. We were then taken for our tour. Altogether we were out on the bikes for about 3-4 hours. First we stopped off at the top of some hills where we had amazing views and could see to the Atlas Mountains. We then continued and stopped off at a locals house. He had made us pancakes with honey and tea. We then rode back to the start point. The views were amazing and everyone was happy to see you with the shepherds and children all waving and smiling at you. Great experience and excellent value for money, costing around \u00a3100 for 2 bikes for the whole afternoon. Highly recommend this trip!"

I learned about Dunes & Desert from a travel forum I frequent. I was a little nervous paying 100% upfront on the website (instead of simply putting down a deposit or paying the amount on the morning of), however the payment and booking process went smoothly (paypal) and they picked us up on time. First they took us to their main office where they had us sign a waiver and went over the basics of camel riding. The man working with us knew English very well. The whole \"intake\" process was extremely organized. We put our belongings in the lockers they provided, and then we went out to the camels. The camels were really cute, and were very easy to ride, even for a first-timer. Our guide didn't speak much English, however he was nice enough. My main issue with the camel ride is that it was LONG!! I believe they said it was 5 miles, but the camels walked SLOW and it seemed to take forever. It was enjoyable, but could have been cut down to an hour or so. If you have an adrenaline junky in your group, he may want to skip this part. Then you go to lunch at this nice outdoor area. It's very peaceful, and the tagine was ok. However, there is nothing for vegetarians to eat (unless you're ok with picking meat out of your food). Then we took the camel back to the office, and boarded the Quads after a short safety briefing. None of us had ridden quads before, so we were a little nervous, but it turned out to be the best part of the day! A driver guides you through various paths of varying difficulty and speed, including paths through villages. You start out slow, so you can get the hang of how to drive it, then you pick up speed and difficulty throughout the day. It was a rough ride at times, and we were a little sore the next day, but it was a LOT of fun!!! The views along the way were absolutely amazing! You stop at the top of this mountain to take pictures. I highly recommend it. One tip is to wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty. You will end up covered in dust. Also, they take pics of you throughout the day and sell them to you at the end. I forgot how much it was, but the price was moderate and they will negotiate. Also, the guides will take pics with your camera if you ask them. Overall it was a great experience that I highly recommend, even for beginners. The camel portion may be a little slow for people who like a little more action, but the Quads were amazing."

The first have of the tour was the camels. This fulfilled one of my childhood dreams of riding a camel into the desert. We rode the camels for about 2.5 hours round trip. 1 hour to a break site where we had a meal and then 1 hour back. There were 4 of us in total on the tour and the camels were tethered together. At the halfway point we met another group on tour. It was an amazing an scenic experience riding through the desert on these tall animals and our tour guides were very friendly, keeping the mood light and taking photographs using our cameras.The second half of the tour was the ATV quad bike tour. This lasted about 3 hours. It started with a safety brief an a quick familiarization of the vehicles before heading out. No driver's license required. It didn't take long to get used to the bikes and the tour took us through desert villages, past goat herders well into the desert. There was another break at the same location of the camel tour and then we proceeded further into the desert up into the Atlas mountains. The view from the mountains was epic and the day was just amazing in general. On the way back they took us through a technical course of winding dunes which took a little getting used to. I'm not gonna lie it was a little hair raising but very exhilarating. I really recommend the dunes & desert tour for a day filled with desert fun and hi-jinks."

The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. The camel ride involves a slow paced walk through the desert and oasis palm groves before ending up in a small Berber village where you have snacks and delicious tea before setting back.

I would highly recommend for a great day out from the city and a relaxing afternoon experiencing some local culture."

The walk was fantastic; not exactly a gentle stroll but not too robust and there were beautiful views and a fascinating insight of Berber life was provided by Saida. Once we returned to Saida's family home, we were given a wonderful meal while sitting outside contemplating the views.The journey back to Marrakech was just as good, there were plenty of opportunities to stop and take photos; Moha was an excellent and amusing guide and driver - the whole trip was the highlight of our Moroccan visit.

With their good humor and constant laughs, they made the experience exceptional. When it came to the quad portion, I got stuck at first with a small group that had never ridden so we went very slowly to our first stop for lunch. But seeing that I wanted more from the experience, the guide called his boss, who sent out a dedicated guide for me. My guide took me on the ride of a lifetime, running me at full throttle the entire way through the beautiful desert and through some grueling but fun terrain. My ride was more than I expected and I appreciated the fact that they accommodated my unique needs for speed and adventure...

We were collected on time and returned back to the drop off near our riad. Lunch was 3 courses - salad, beef tagine and fruit - in a small village away from the exploration centre. All excellent and would thoroughly recommend."

We were a family group of 10 and had an amazing time. The guides were terrific, they had everything under control and were great fun at the same time. 'Eddie Murphy' ( the name aptly given to our lead guide) was a laugh a minute. The stop for mint tea, pancakes and honey was great too. A perfect way of seeing something of the desert landscape outside the busy city. I would certainly recommend the camel trek to anyone going to Marrakech."

They pick you up at your hotel and drop you back off at the end. The included meals are on the small side but high quality and you wouldn't want to be stuffed with these activities anyway. The Staff was super nice and helpful always wiling to take pictures and answer questions. I got more time on the quad than I thought we would have. But my only complaint is that we couldn't have too much fun on the them, couldn't go too fast or do bumps or turns."

This isn't a trek through the Sahara its a tourist walk on a camel. The camel guides sang and laughed, lots of great photos, nice stop for tea,singing and a snack. A couple hours riding is all your thighs will need trust me.All this for around 30 euro including pickup and dropoff at your location. Great value, good memories.Thank you Banana(my camel) for a lot of great pictures and stories. (That is not me standing on the camel)"

It isn't really a desert, but it is perfect terrain for quad biking. We were picked up on time and arrived to be given mint tea and filled in forms etc. We were given a fairly quick talk on the bikes and suited up with helmets, goggles, over-jackets and some long socks. After a short practice we were off for miles of fun riding. We stopped for a drink of water a couple of times and were given a really nice tangine for lunch. We ate quite a few tangines in Marrakesh, but this was one of the best. My daughter and her partner had also booked a half day ride. I have to mention that if you are not a confident driver/rider then quad bikes are quite demanding. It seems obvious, but you have to remember to steer! If like me you are used to a motorcycle you have to learn a whole new way of driving, especially if you want to get a move on. You are following a guide all the way and he signals when to slow down and seems to adjust the pace according to how confident people are. My daughter found it quite difficult, so this is not for everyone. You get hot and sweaty and covered in dust which they used an air hose to blow off us at the end of the ride, (a new experience for me!). Altogether a really good experience and recommended provided you can manage the quad bikes."

We were picked up from the hotel and driven the short distance to the activity base where we were greeted with mint tea. After a short wait we were split off into our group and lead out to the camels. Having never ridden one I was a little dubious about how to get on but the guides were great in getting everyone on and off we went. The trek itself was fantastic, I wouldn't say the route was very scenic but still, there's something very relaxing about slowly trotting along on a camel. We picked the morning tour and heat was pleasant without being oppressive, I could imagine though in the height of summer or in the afternoon it might be a bit more of an issue. Throughout the guides were attentive and upbeat, helping people to relax and enjoy themselves. The stop for food was perfectly timed to give your legs and back a little break, and who can say no to pancakes with honey and mint tea?Overall a great experience, half a day seemed about right for a first time, though now having had a little experience I'd be tempted by the longer tours up into the mountains for a more scenic experience. Throughout we were looked after and the door to door service makes this completely no hassle to do."

We asked at our hotel desk (Le Kech Boutique) about going on a camel ride outside of the city, this was obviously a company they have some kind of deal with, but as the hotel we good, we had every faith this company would be also. We were given 2 time options, morning or afternoon and chose afternoon.We were slightly concerned about a few things, aside from having never ridden a camel before, we just didnt know what else to expect.If you want a good length camel ride, with great guides, that is made as easy as possible for you, choose these guys. We were picked up at our hotel right on time, we then picked up 2 other couples, i must admit having 2 other friendly brittish couples in the group probably helped make the trip.We were taken out into the desert where we got to their base, we were given water (out of a bottle of shop bought water) and were able to use the loos and then we set off.If you havent really ridden many animals before, this is the trip for you, because 2 hours sounds like no time at all, but when your legs and backside aren't used to it, 2 hours is enough, trust me here. Ths is also a great one for kids, we didnt have any kids in our group, but the family we joined up with for tea and pancakes did and the guides were brilliant with the children.After a short stop, it was back on the camels, who were very funny friendly creatures, back to base and a short minibus ride back to our hotel doorstep. I would reccomend this company to anyone that wanted a nice experience without any hassle."

When we arrived after our pick up everything was very organised and we were out into small groups, given lockers if needed and given helmets, goggles and socks to cover our legs from the heat of the engine. ( We signed a little contract too)We went out with a guide and he came up and spoke to us all individually about how the machines worked and how we felt about it / if we had done it before. i am not a driver and I have never been on a Quad so I was nervous and he made me feel relaxed and we went round for about 10 minutes close to the base just practising and getting used to driving which I found really useful. He then came over to double check that we all felt ok with it and I think he could see I was a bit nervous so he brought me to the front, just behind him, so I felt better. We then got going and went on a few different types of terrain and travelled approx 40-50km!! We stopped twice - once at the top of a small mountain where we could have a drink (provided) and take photographs. I didn't have a camera because I left it in the locker but the guide took photos and later emailed me them! The second stop was at a Berber tent where they provided local food and drink, berber Tea and lovely snack that I don't know the name of unfortunately but it was very good! We took more photos there too. I really lovely day out and the guide was awesome and so were all the other staff we came across at the base. Can't recommend them enough!"

I paid a small supplement to be picked up from the hotel, which was well worth it. My family had an amazing day for so many reasons. I know it's rare, but I have to say that I couldn't fault the package. It just flowed. There was time for excitement and time to relax and take it all in.The camel trek in the morning was a really relaxing experience away from the chaos of Marrakech. They made sure you looked the part for a camel adventure by setting you up with a desert Touareg turban\u2015 Lawrence of Arabia eat your heart out! With the Atlas Mountains as a spectacular back drop we set off through the dusty desert with our four friendly guides. We stopped after about an hour, which was perfect, and went to a Berber house for mint tea and pancakes with honey. We sat on the floor on big comfy cushions that were placed around low tables. It was simple but very traditional, with well-worn Moroccan rugs and a large hand-built wood and reed canopy to shade us from the sun. The Berber people were friendly and the service was great. I could've happily stayed there all day relaxing with my family. We went back a different way so it didn't get boring. The guides never stopped smiling and being cheerful. They regularly asked if we were ok and even found the time to weave camels out of palm tree leaves for the kids.I was a little concerned about safety on the quads, especially for my three children, but my fears were soon put to rest when I saw how seriously they took the safety side of things. We were kitted out with quality safety equipment and given a thorough briefing in English. Our guide was very friendly and experienced. He took it easy for the first 15 minutes to ensure we all had the skills to manoeuvre the quads.Happily, we went back to the same Berber house for a leisurely lunch. They were waiting outside with soap, water and a towel to freshen up before we treated to a delicious 3-course lunch (inc. a lamb & vegetable tagine), with plenty of water, soft drinks and mint tea on offer. The traditional homemade bread was to die for.This excursion was by far the highlight of our holiday and a fantastic way for our twins to celebrate a decade on this amazing planet \u2015and I have the photos to prove it!

This was my second time using D&D and like the first time it was certainly worth the money.For those complaining about not getting the required adrenaline rush when on the quads that might be because when you book a quad you go in a larger group, consequently you are only as fast as the slowest person in your group.I have always chosen to pay the extra to get the rhino buggy,that way it's just me,the Mrs and our guide. The only criteria is \"keep up\" and since both of us are not novices and love a bit of speed it means we get value for our cash.If you want fun that's what you need to do.Once again thank you very much D&D!"

Genuinely one of the nicest Moroccans we met on our holiday there.The booking process was very smooth and accomodating. Omar and Jerome were both very happy to help. Our transport picked us up from the hotel first thing and took us to the venue. We were the only couple on the bus on both legs of our journey - just goes to show the level of service on offer here. Very promising start.Upon arrival we were greeted, sat down and talked through the forms, given mint tea too which was a nice touch. After sorting out our locker we were introduced to the lovely Momo who was happy to help fitting us out with helmets etc.We had booked a 1 pilot & 1 passenger package for a half day through the desert, so after us both having a test to make sure we were comfortable with the controls we set off following our guide Momo. The views were great and andrenaline was flowing.Our first stop was up in the mountains were Momo was more than happy to take pictures for us and even going to the lengths of positioning our quad on some rocks to make the perfect back drop. He really went the extra mile. After consuming some water and the fantastic landscape views we set off again.The next stop was at a very traditional Berber Village. Momo shared his knowledge with us and took us inside where we met two lovely local women. We sat on the traditional cushions and had mint tea, pancakes and honey all made by the two women. A simple, yet wonderful experience, a real eye opener and break away from reality back in the UK. Upon leaving we thanked and tipped the women for allowing us in their home, the least we could do to say thank you.We then made our way back to the venue after exploring more of the landscapes and desert. What a fantastic experience we had! Once back at the venue we purchased a professional picture taken near the start of the trip for 50DH (5 EUR) which isn't a lot really. The trip was topped off by having the desert sand blown off us by Momo and an air gun. What a trip! We did this on Monday the 15th of June, which was also our last day in Morocco. It made our holiday and is both of our favourite memory of Marrakech. No hassle, no bother just great views, great experiences and great company.If you go on this trip,Thank you!Justin and Ellie"

Very full briefing on what we were going to do (Quad Biking) and how everything operates. The safety gear was of good quality - helmets, googles and balaclava. We were given a trial area to follow our guide (we had two at front and rear) and get used to our machines. We then set off. I initially wondered whether the trip would be worthwhile because it looked flat all the way to some far away hills. However this was through a rocky desert landscape, past small holdings and groups of houses. WE reached those far away hills and went through a small pass to eventually climb a small hill. This had a 360 degree view around a small farming valley with workers in the fields. We had a drink of water, took some photos and set off on the return. We stopped at a Berber house for tea and fried flat bread and honey - nice.The friendliness of this team made the expereience (even air hosing you down at the end to get most of the dust away. I am glad we did it in the morning as we got the morning cool as the heat built.We booked through Viator and have no complaints - recommended."

When we stopped for a break of delicious mint tea and crepes with honey, we were bit relieved. The camels were very friendly. The guides lovely and funny, we kept singing along and made jokes. They were willing to take pictures with our cameras and also took professional photos that we could purchase. One of the leaders kept encouraging the camels to trot - fun!

I forgot to book in advance and when I checked on Viator the day before it had sold out. Our riad called through and managed to get us booked onto the morning tour anyway and I was elated! They came and collected us from our riad at 9am and drove us to the place. Very small amount of time is taken having some mint tea and filling out a form. They got us started on our quad bikes and gave us a little warm up to get used to them and then off we go! we got to ride through the desserts, palm groves and Berber villages. The little children all run out and hold out their hands for you to touch - but try to avoid doing this as it is not safe for them. My boyfriend struggled with the speed we were all going, which to me was very fast, but as he is a motorbike rider and loves speed it wasn't exciting enough for him. That was okay though as the guides were fantastic and noticed this straight away and actually took him on a different route one on one, so he could really go fast and do all sorts jumps and tricks that I would not be willing to do! I thought this was very good of them to do for him.Half way through the tour you stop on a hill with incredible views where you get some water and lots of photo opportunities. The guides were fantastic even suggesting good poses to do to get the best pictures. The tour then continues as you stop at a Berber village home for some snacks and tea before heading back to base.This tour was fantastic. It was fun, different and exciting. Seeing the local Berber people was a good experience and the route we took on the tour was great. I was also thoroughly impressed with the flexibility of the guides and their willingness to accommodate my boyfriends speed need! Please don't worry that because of this it is a slow tour, it most definitely isn't - you still get to go fast. I recommend this tour to everyone!!Tips:Go toilet at base before starting, to ensure you are comfortable for the tourWear your worst clothes - you will get absolutely filthy! I mean dust EVERYWHERE!If it is a sunny day make sure you slap on a high factor sun cream or even better bring a light shirt or hoody to throw over for cover. Also if it is slightly windy you may get cold on the bike.Bring some spare money, the tour guides are fantastic and you will probably want to tip them. We made the mistake of bringing only the exact money and I was disappointing I could not show my true appreciation.Next time we will do the full day tour!"

After a phone call it was all sorted, but we were now 45 min. late starting the tour. The other persons riding camels had left so it was nice to know that they were not waiting for us. The workers were pleasant so when we arrived we got personalized attention. Introductions were done, we were given a white head dress, and walked to our camels.Our tour guide was a comedian. He would lie on the camel, stand on its back, and other tricks. The kids enjoyed watching him. The other guide would make camels from long grass for the kids.Tea was a nice break Once again our group was by itself, so we just really enjoyed the outdoors. I would recommend camel trekking for 2 hours for any group."

We had lovely crepes and mint tea mid morning and then back on the camels to head back to the main base prior to getting on the quads.

We had some trouble finding it and had to call the centre. The minibus then drove around Marrakesh and picked up 2 other groups of tourists - this wasn't the best start to the day and wasted about an hour.Dune Buggy Issues:Once we arrived at the Dunes and Desert base we were greeted and welcomed by the staff who were very nice. After signing a disclaimer which included assuming liability for any damage to the Dune Buggy/ ATV we were allowed to proceed. The Dune Buggy on offer was not as described or pictured and was more like a golf cart. It was explained to us that the Buggy was not as safe as previous models and had a habit of flipping over. We opted to ride an ATV instead although we asked for more money to have 2 ATVs. The terrain was mostly dry mountain paths. The experience itself was awesome:The views were unbelievable and there was an opportunity to stop for a photograph. Meeting the Berber family was a nice touch and the ATVs worked well.Overall:It felt like a few corners were being cut by the company which did affect our overall experience. Driving ATVs through the mountains is so fun and a slightly more polished customer service experience would make all the difference.Advice:Half day was plenty. We considered booking a full day but were glad to only do the half day because driving the ATVs does put a lot of pressure on wrist and thumb joints. Prepare to get very dusty!"

ABSOLUTLEY AMAZING. All details were sorted prior to our UK departure, (If you have any difficulty booking on the website just email them and they will email back and arrange everything).We were picked up on time and taken to the lake area which was approx 40mins drive from Marrakech. Once there we met Momo our guide for the day. He spoke very good English and gave us the full safety briefing for the quad bikes, provided helmets, goggles and gloves and also a protective smock/poncho to save your clothes from the dust. The quad bikes are easy to ride, even for me as I had never ridden one before. After a practice getting used to them we were off. The tour took us round part of the lake and through Berber villages and constantly changing countryside stopping for lunch with a Berber family in their home. Momo took us to areas not accessible to vehicles, on top of hills to look at the breath-taking views across Morocco. This was one of the best trips I have ever experienced and Momo was a star and a real professional. If you want more from a break to Marrakech than just the city then this is an absolute must.Tips:- Use the toilet before being picked up as it is a long morning without proper breaks \u2013 although water is provided and you can stop whenever you want for camera shots etc.Lesley & Tina"

Very affordable excursion and the guides are super accommodating and helpful!! Hands down was the best way to see the countryside and ride through local towns. Very well run and organized. They were flexible with their prices as well so if price is an issue shoot them an email and they will be accommodating! Must do Excursion!"

            "review": "An experience worth doing!. The quad biking experience for us was a particularly brilliant one as myself and my boyfriend were the only 2 booked for the afternoon.We were on the base camp for less than 20mins before we were on the quads and off! We had a quick but informative briefing on the dos and donts, safety advice and signals, were geared up and then followed in a line behind our guide all the way.The experience was a great one, you get to drive across quite a varied selection of terrains and the guide is constantly looking out for you to make sure you're all ok. The quads were easy to use and along various points we would stop and have our photos taken by the guide across the desert. We stopped on a hill top which gave beautiful views all round for a good 20minutes having a rest and drink. On the way back we stopped at a Burber house to have tea and pancakes which gave us a chance to experience and understand Burber life through the great knowledge of our brilliant guide.The whole experience lasted between 2-3hrs and afterwards we were contemplating booking the 1day tour as we enjoyed it that much! The bikes can be tricky, uncomfortable and difficult to master to start with if you've not used a quad before, as you're focusing on everything at once, but after a good few miles you easily learn how to control the bumps and bends and enjoy it much more easily!The guide we had was brilliant, he made you feel safe and confident and having been doing it for many years, knew the area and track perfectly! We would highly recommend this company if you're looking for a unique experience on the quads."

We could not have picked a better way to get to see the countryside - some of the best views we had while in the country. We were picked up at our hotel, despite it being somewhat outside the city proper. The guides did a great job of adjusting to different abilities. Lunch was a delicious tajine. Our suggestion would be to take the full day trip, a half day would have not been enough to see everything."

I was emailed shortly after with the details of the pick up point - which I am assuming is the closest point to where your accommodation is. We were staying in the kasbah so were collected from the tombs, the driver was on time and then we were on our way to collect others booked on the excursion. It was a relatively short drive to the quad station and when we arrived we were greeted with mint tea whilst completing a form. We were then give goggles, helmets and jacket, then was asked to stand around the quads whilst someone explained the basics. We were then led by a guide to the practice area and then off we went with the guide. Note: whilst riding your hands can get very cold so wear gloves, the guide was brilliant and let me use his gloves! What can I say about the quad biking - it was amazing, so too were the views! We made a stop at a Berber village for tea and crepes and then headed back to the station for our transfers back. They do take photos and say they will send them, but we were just sent a link to a Google plus site where I only found one photo of us, so make sure you take some photos of your own! I cannot fault the whole experience from start to finish. I would highly recommend dunes and deserts. Thanks for a brilliant morning :-)"

I was attending a business congress in Marrakech taling place at the Pullman Hotel and wanted to entertain an important client who is also a keen photographer. I approached the Dunes and Desert office and was helped by Soumia. I explained that I wanted something a little tailor-made with a flexible driver who was willing to stop while we took photos. We also wanted to see the 'real' Morocco. Soumia organised a day trip to a Berber village in the foothills of High Atlas. Our driver, Mohamed was very flexible, accommodating and fun to be with. We travelled through the foothills and stopped for both photos and a meal in a Berber household were we were hosted by Saida, After the meal, Saida took us up the mountain where we were able to take photographs and also understand the Berber way of life.The excursion was all we could have asked for and more."

After phoning the organisation we got told, they would send someone just to call back ten minutes later to tell us that no one is coming anymore. They asked us to rebook but since it was our last day in Marrakesh it wasn't an option for us. They promised to refund the money but it took them two more weeks and another email until I finally had my money back. We learned our lesson and rather book tours directly at the destination."

We drove to a little berber house for pancakes and mint tea, sooo tasty. Well worth the money aswell. We are not experienced drivers and these people definately put you at ease and you get used to driving after a few minutes so its suitable for anyone.

Our guide Younis tied the Moroccan style scarf so we can start the camel ride! It was quiet and peaceful. He offered to take pictures for us which was very kind. We arrived at a traditional house and were able to wash our hands (thank god!) and had crepes and more mint tea! The local man called Hisham taught us how to pour mint tea and let us practice (meaning we just made a huge mess and had a great laugh) Once we finished our break we headed back. On the way since we felt comfortable we asked to go faster and again more fun and laughter as the camels galloped! Younis tore some plant leaves off and we were wondering why but did not ask. 15 min later he presented us with the cutest camels made from those leaves. This was a thoughtful gesture :) Once we returned, we changed into the protective clothing and had the quad bike session. Our instructor was again very good and professional. He let us practice with him and also kept an eye out for the group. We stopped again at Hishams place for lunch (lamb tagine) and got fruit for dessert :) felt really welcomed :) Overall we will definitely go again but this time all get a quad bike each rather than sharing! :)"

The bikes and facility are in top shape, the staff welcoming and thorough, and the route fun and beautiful. My wife was apprehensive even as she started out on the tour. She even gave me a double thumbs down because she didn't know if she could control the bike. 5 minutes into it, she was as comfortable as if she'd been riding for yrs. The fact the bikes are automatic transmissions and that the tour leader takes us on a familiarization course at the start helped greatly.The scenery was gorgeous and I was trull blown away by the variety in sand, rocks and views. The villages were great to get up close and ride slowly through. The children wave and wave and wave. The guide planned relax stops at appropriate times and the break for tea and bread was opportune. At the end, my wife gave this two thumbs up and says she would definitely do this again on our next trip back to morocco.The owners of the company are great and very accommodating. They care about their guests and keep a tidy shop with skilled mechanics and staff. I highly recommend."

The guides spoke very good English which made us feel comfortable during our trip.We chose our bikes and were fitted with a balaclava, helmet and goggles. I would recommend taking a rucksack or sturdy camera case around your neck and nothing else, as there is no where to leave any bags whilst riding. We all engaged in a practice ride around a small track for a few circles to get used to the quad. Don't think you won't be able to do it, because that's what I thought and it was so easy and so so fun!The ride itself was fantastic, we saw the real Marrakech. Riding around farms with farmers and animals, small Berber villages, schools and over little dunes, seeing the locals and their way of life.After around an hour, we stopped for some mint tea, water and crepes in a little hut in the middle of the desert. Very surreal - but a great experience! We then rode back to the quad bike centre, where you are able to purchase a photo of yourself on board the quad for around 20 dirhams I believe, which is a nice souvenir.All in all, a fantastic half-day trip which allows you to see Marrakech beyond the little bubble of your hotel room, I would 100% recommend this trip!"

Admittedly as only travelled with hand luggage and booked while in Marrakech we didn't have exactly appropriate hiking footwear (Converse) or clothes (shorts and hoody). On arrival our guide noticed this and altered our trip accordingly and asked us if this was fine. He was a fantastic guide and as he was a local he gave us a fantastic insight into Berber life in the Atlas Mountains, such as Children walking for miles to go to school, how they conserve water, about their religion etc... He was very attentive and really looked after us. We went to a local homestay where lovely food was prepared for us and when it began to snow they lit the fire for us. The low clouds, and snow made the views spectacular! An amazing experience. No tips were expected or demanded and were genuienely great people! Would seriously reccomend this tour!

The company were very professional and helpful with all of the booking aspects. After arriving in Marrakech we discovered that rain was scheduled for the day we were due to go on the trek so we contacted the rep and there was no problem at all in changing the day.Our guide for the day Nourradine gave us the choice of 3 treks to do, and we chose to do the longest trek, around 6 hours of walking up to berber village at 2300m above sea level, setting off from the village of Setti Fatma in the Ourika Valley. I can only say that the entire experience was truly one of the most magical we have had. It was a beautiful day with no clouds in the sky and fresh snow had fallen to make it even more special. The views from the top of the walk were absolutely breathtaking. We stopped for lunch in the local berber village and ate with a local couple who were so welcoming and had cooked us a really special Tagine for lunch which we ate on their terrace overlooking the stunning scenery. The walk down was just as impressive and it was wonderful to see the locals going about their daily routine whilst we passed through. If you are looking for an authentic, eco-friendly and ethical trek into the Atlas mountains I would definitely recommend using Dunes & Desert."

We opted in for a half day camel ride followed by lunch and half day of quadbiking. Once we arrived we were briefed. Started off with a camelride through the dessert, amazing views of palm trees and fantastic hot weather. Our guide was funny, charasmatic and always smiling. He even gave us a little gift of a camel made out of tree leaves. The views of the lake and mountains were definitely one of a kind. Must say, the camel ride was a workout. Not the most comfortable but worth the experience.We were taken to the most spectacular places for great photos. After two hours of camel riding, we visited a small house for some Morrocan tea and delicious home made pancakes with syrup. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing and laidback, sharing laughs with the tour guides and taking photos all the way through.After a 20minute break, we were given a safety talk for the quadbiking. We headed upto another house for an hour lunch break. This consisted of delicious fresh vegetable starters, freshly baked bread, lamb dishes with potatoes and lentils and a desert of fruits. This allowed us to top up our tans inbetween the food and relax .After lunch we proceeded to a 2hour quadbike through the dessert. Such a thrilling experience, riding fast through potholes leading upto the mountains for an amazing landscape view. Be warned, this is not for the fainthearted. If you are like me, who is scared of heights. This is the best way to overcome them. We were taken to delightful views of mountains, farm animals and sceneries.Having reached the mountains, we were greeted with more Morrocan Tea and a catch up with the other groups. We then proceeded to the next mountain across the field. Must say the flooring is quite rough full of stones so being careful and knowing when to brake is a must.Once we reached the mountains, it was an hour quadbike back. The tour guided were fun and raced along with us. Amazing tour guides who were witty and hilarious. Always caring for us and making sure we were ok. Overall a fantastic experience, really made our trip to Marrakech a memorable fun experience. We were only in Marrakech for 2nights and 3days but this made our time there worthwhile. Highly recommend. Prepare to have mud smears on your face. "

This was a brilliant must do in Marrakech. I would recommend it to anyone. Safety is clearly a priority with these guys but they let adults and kids enjoy it along the way.

The process was fairly simple although I did have to call them to give them my credit card number which was a bit dodgy. The staff did make sure that they booked the correct tour that I wanted in the end.On the day of the tour they were supposed to pick us up at our hotel early in the morning. We hired a private driver and were told we were the only two people on the day tour. The company asked that we be down in the hotel lobby early so the driver would not have to wait. As it turns out we are the ones that had to wait an hour. I had to have the hotel concierge call the company a half hour after the pick up time to see what the status was and it was very clear that they had forgotten about our booking. It was the only excursion that I booked outside of the assistance of the hotel concierge and we ended up regretting it.When the driver did finally arrive an hour late, he did not mention anything about being late to pick us up or offer an apology. More importantly, he did not speak English and we reserved an English language tour. It was a very long drive to Essaouira and back. Along the way we had a chance to look at the small villages and towns where there wasn't a tourist in sight. It would have been nice if the driver was able to tell us what it was that we were seeing and elaborated on the landscape. This ended up being an issue that seriously impacted our experience because the drive was a majority of the tour time.When we arrived at Essaouira the tour guide met us promptly at the beach. The tour guide was very good and he managed to do a great job of showing us the areas of the city that we were most interested in. He took us to a lot of fantastic shops that had quality handmade goods. The city had a lot of shopping and a fantastic beach that deserved more than a day trip.There was some good parts of this tour which is why I didn't give it a one star rating despite my displeasure with the overall experience. An English-speaking representative of the company ended up calling us on the way back from Essaouira but at that point it was too late to salvage the impression.When we made it back to the hotel the driver even tried to increase the rate of the tour final payment amount without reason. I have to wait in the hotel lobby while he called the company so that I could speak to someone and advise them of their continued errors. I would not use this company again and I wouldn't recommend them for anything unless they can shore up their customer service."

I saw Dunes &b Desert advertised online and decided to give them a try after reading some very good reviews.We hired 2 Quad bikes - one for me and one for my fella - but you can share one bike and switch drivers if you prefer. The cost was 100 for both of us and it was truly worth every penny! Be prepared to get dusty as you're out in the desert but be prepared to have a completely awesome unforgettable experience too - amazing! The Dunes & Desert guys are so friendly and speak fantastic English (And French). There were lockers to leave your things in, although I took my camera on the ride, and provide you with all the equipment like helmets, goggles and a protective jacket. The ride starts with a quick lesson on how to drive the quad bikes (Very easy) and then you're off :) My fella got the hang of it alot quicker than I did but after about 20 mins, I found riding really easy too. The terrain and the views were amazing, from riding on sand to rocks to clay and being in the desert in one direction and mountains on the other. Simply breath-taking!The experience itself was amazing with the highlights being stopping at the top of a mountain at one point and having mint tea and pancakes with a local family too. This is a must-do for anybody visiting Marrakesh and if we go back next year as planned, we'll definitely be doing this or taking one of the buggies out with the guys at Dunes & Desert!"

The trip lasts for 4 hours in total, with traditional Moroccan crepes and mint tea in a village house half way through. The staff put in a lot of effort to provide great customer service and make you feel safe and well looked after."

We paid a 50% deposit upfront and the remainder on the day.We booked for 2 drivers on the half day Marrakech excursion. We were picked up from our Hotel (despite the hotel being a pain!!) and taken to meet up at the location. There were 3 others on our tour and the guys did a great job of getting us kitted up and explaining the bikes to the us. I'd quadded before but my girlfriend was a little nervous and they did a great job of encouraging her!We were on the bikes for around 2.30hrs and you cover a variety of terrains, driving through villages etc, roads, dirt, rocks, hills, sand etc. In my opinion it was a little flat but perfect for either novices or people that have never been on a bike before. Saying that, it was still very enjoyable!The bikes seemed to be in great condition and the guys were very conscious on the safety of the group, which was reassuring. There was cold water available for free throughout the trip and the stop in the Berber village for Tea and Pancakes was a welcome break and nice to soak up.Well recommended and would do the excursion again! Hopefully this time the girlfriend will go a little faster!!"

We were collected from our Riad in the center of the Medina and taken out to the desert where we were greeted by the full team of very friendly guides and managers and offered a mint tea.After the briefing and look over the quads themselves we got going and although the start was steady (Probably to suit our inexperience) it soon picked up and before we ate a massive and very tasty dinner in one of the villages we were really moving. After dinner the route took us past and through a number of villages as well as to a summit of one of the larger hills in the area.Over all a very smooth operation with some excellent machines which you no doubt will enjoy. We would recommend doing the full day to get a great dinner and seeing some more of the scenery in and around the villages.Blyth & Kate"

HIGHS:- the seriousness of the company about safety.- the material was in good condition.- the water and pancakes in the middle of the ride.- the kindness of the guides.- the free lockers.LOWS:- the landscape of the Palmeraie ride is not beautiful... there is only 1 beautiful view, the rest is just OK... we even past by a garbage spot by a dried river...- there are not dunes like in the pictures of the company website, not mountain landscape...- A bit boring for those used to ride motorbikes since you are not aloud to do and go wherever you want, go fast... you go on line... they are worried about your safety.TIPS:- Quads are very fun but very expensive so it's important to pick a beautiful landscape.- If you can choose another location for the quads like a desert with dunes in Essaouira, Ouarzazate... much better than the Palmeraie. If you are just staying in Marrakech and you have never ride a motorbike, you'll like it.- The heat during August was not a problem."

The staff are friendly and reassuring, and the stop offs half way through each took us to little family homes where we were able to rest, and they made us tea and pancakes. The quad biking was so much fun and the guides split us into ability to groups so the more confident people weren't held up by those who were a bit nervous and wanted to go a bit slower. There's a great mixture of sights and terrains, varying from going up a mountain to through a little village without electricity. An overall brilliant experience with a company wo clearly know their stuff. The camel ride was more relaxing though also lots of fun. Being close to the city, an not being able to get that far on a camel in an hour and a half, it's a bit of a stretch to say its in the desert, but la palmerie is a beautiful area and the trip they took us on was great. The camels looked a lot healthier and better looked after than others we saw, and they appeared to be treated well by the staff."

I booked the half day quad trip fairly last minute after reading the reviews and investigating other excursion companies, and,well... I'm very pleased I did. It was really faultless. From the beginning the booking process was very professional. Despite my last minute booking, the communication was very good and we were picked up on time at the agreed location. Upon arrival we were greeted by a nice gentleman who kindly made us a tea while we went through the formalities of the day. We were then fitted up with the gear, introduced to our 4-wheeled beast, and had a 5 minute training session in the open sand. Then, we were off. Due to the size of our group, they quite smartly broke us into two, and also very cleverly took different paths to end up at the same point. I felt free to go as fast as I pleased provided we didn't misbehave, and got to really experience the capabilities of the quad with a mixture of paved track, rock covered roads, sandy plains, and more rugged challenging terrain. The guide was always checking behind him so we didn't lose the slowest person, but as we seemed to have a fairly capable group, we kept the speed up. Before I knew it we had cruised through a few villages, stopped to give some people water, yielded to let a heard of sheep (I think) pass...before ascending the rocky hill to stop on top for a water / photo break. After we accumulated enough vanity shots to satisfy our social networking needs, it was down the hill for a mint tea and pancake break in a dwelling of sorts. After another 15 mins we were back at the HQ to de-dust and get transport back. It was definitely the highlight of the 4 days, and frankly, I'm already thinking about the full-day trip, or even the multi-day trip and a flight back. If you have the time, I'd suggest something longer, although I'm sure for those of you packing in alot to your trip, the half day will suffice. It's simply a blast - I can guarantee you'll talk about it for days to come..."

Our guide and im sorry i cant remember his name , was really nice , checked that we were ok and provided us with information on our stops . The villages you past thru give you a truly Morroccon feel , rounded off by a mint tea drink and Mezme (pancake).

We both had a great time enjoying the ride and the scenery. I definitely think it is fantastic for beginners.I would recommend paying the total price upfront as it cost \u00a310 fee from our bank to transfer the deposit the 3% card charge on the day - I just think it would have been easier to pay it all at the beginning.

We were lucky to be in a small group, just our family and the guide. It was a lot of fun, I can absolutely recommend it."

Very well organised, good focus on safety, well maintained vehicles and great guides plus the awesome scenery and the fact you are belting through the desert at up to 60kph makes this an excellent day out. The only sour note for me was the follow up email soliciting a 5 star review - not necessary and unprofessional."

However this turned out to be one of the highlights of the stay in Marrakech. The guide was really kind and friendly and the trip was fairly scenic for Marrakech. There was a toilet available (European style) at the start /finish point and one available at the stop-off (Morrocan). Also useful to know that there are lockers available. No complaints at all about the experience and would recommend. Five stars awarded by me for this experience...but then 1 star for the camels I am afraid:On the basis that we had such a great experience with tis company, we then booked the camel riding with them a couple of days later. (We rode camels a few years back in Egypt and had .loved it)unfortunately I can't think of much good to say about this one. The route was ugly, the camels were extraordinarily uncomfortable, ( my husband actually bailed out halfway and walked back!), and there was none of the friendly and informative interaction at we experienced with the Quad/buggy guide. There were NO Toilets available at any point and no lockers. We actually wondered if it was indeed run by the same company."

I went twice during our brief stay; the price is about right at around \u00a350 for a couple of hours of exhilarating fun. Mo was our guide, he certainly did not let any of the horses get unused and we had a break for pancakes and desert whiskey. There were four of us on my first trip and we opened up the accelerator on a few occasions bringing a smile that never left my face. I have to say quoting Miranda \u201cSuch Fun\u201d.The second trip was however was entwined with a Camel trip as well as Quad biking. All I will say is if you have a choice, leave the Camels at home it was more of a Camel carry than a Camel ride. They were tethered together so close the Camel behind might as well have hitched a ride with me. If he could (assuming a he) we could have had a great conversation. Disappointing; unlike the Quad biking of course, truly recommend it to young and old they vary the pace according to the group.If you have a choice drop the Camels and have the extra time on the Quads .\u201c Such Fun\u201d"

There we had a well received cup of local char with bread and honey.The quad bikes were next, the terrain is mostly flat so it was enjoyable but not challenging and was a good speed single file tour of the locality.

My fiance and I decided to take one of these quad tours on a whim and, to their credit, this company was able to accommodate us for a trip on the same day. Perhaps our problem was one of expectation because I have to say this simply wasn't what I expected. I was expecting, as pictured in the brochure, time to freewheel through sand dunes. What we got was the 4x4 equivalent of an escorted pony ride at the zoo. So, if you're expecting any type of adventure or independence, or anything more than driving single file through trails, then this isn't for you. Additionally, a majority of the tour includes \"visiting Berber towns\" which actually means tearing madly through peoples villages. It was great to see up close, but not really very socially responsible. Overall, I would recommend the tour especially for families but not for any avid quad riders or those looking for an authentic desert experience."

It was simple enough to book via the hotel, we were picked up promptly and transported to the HQ. There, they fitted us with helmets and gave us a little run on the quads. They cater for everyone - the more confident and the slightly more nervous riders. If you are a slightly nervous driver - they will sit with you on the quad and stay with you for the journey if you want them - it's all perfectly safe, don't worry about that. They will cater to every level. The actual journey on the bike is incredible. You're taken through the rock terrain, the desert and the villages - it's not an experience you will have again. There are times when you feel like you might topple over - but fear not, it won't happen. The staff are always with you and no one in our group (whether they were driving solo or not) felt anything but safe during the course of the day. And the final lap on the road - i got the chance to let loose and it felt amazing, going at that speed on the road - there's really nothing quite like the driver on those cars. All the staff there are beyond professional and really friendly. You stop for pictures on top of the mountain and a stop for tea and a some bread.

It was great to see the landscape and villages and you feel so much closer to it being on a quad bike compared to in an air conditioned 4x4. It was well organised and safe, but probably not one for less active people, otherwise get it booked, you won't regret it!"

We picked Desert & Dunes for a 4 night/5 day trip from Marrakech, 7 people of mixed ages, through the gorges and oases, to the desert and back. The trip was very well organized, and was a great value. The accommodations and food venues were great and unique, and our driver/guide was professional and knowledgable. We also had one day of hiking near Dades gorge, which was beautiful. It was nice not to feel a bit off the main tourist circuit."

My husband and two daughters, aged 12 and 13, spent 3 hours covering around 20 km with a guide and a couple of other tourists. The scenary was dramatic, and the terrain just perfect, and the girls got to drive themselves, with the guide behind one, and my husband behind the other. they absolutely loved it.The staff were very friendly, very safety conscious, and the equipment was all good.Wear stuff you don't mind getting VERY dusty, and also take your camera with you!

You arrange your day on the internet, then a rep meets you at your hotel, the day before to collect half of the money. A minibus picks you up on the day from your hotel.. Very nice people looking after you and your family.. The guides take you down some crazy and exciting roads and tracks, through villages, up hills, through the dessert.. The faster drivers are soon filtered out and put together to drive a faster route, while slower drivers and children drive an easier safer route.. My advice, put on the big coat cover when they offer you it.. I refused it, and wore my shorts and T-shirt, i was covered in dust, ha ha.. I will definetly go here again with my freinds and family next time... Jerome (Manchester UK)"

We (myself and 2 friends - all male - aged 23, 19 and 18) have just returned back from our trip to Marrakech. Our quad biking adventure (on the morning of Wednesday 19th December, 2012) was a real highlight to our trip. Having pre-read some top reviews about 'Dunes & Desert Exploration' prior to our visit, we had no doubts in booking the half day quad biking excursion - and it certainly didn't disappoint! We were collected on time (9am) from our hotel near the centre of Marrakech by a professionally presented driver in a new 12 seater mini bus. Following an approx. 45min drive to the outskirts of the town, arriving into more desert style surroundings, we reached our start point. After a few minutes of completing some paperwork, we were each fitted with helmets and goggles, and then taken to our quad bikes. A quick safety brief (in French and English) was followed by some practice circuits to familiarise ourselves with the quads (350cc Yamaha's - extremely powerful and very fast, especially on the straights!!), and then we were ready to depart with our guides.The adventure took us through the dusty desert, over rocky hill tops (with amazing views and photo opportunities), through some traditional berber villages, and even stopped halfway for Moroccan tea and pancakes served by a local in their house. Our guides were well experienced, great fun and ensured we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves - which we did!In total we spent approx. 3 hours on the quads, with the remaining time occupied by the collection and drop off transfer from our hotel (roughly 45mins each way), and the safety briefing/fitting of helmets etc..An overall superb experience, and a real highlight to our time in Marrakech. I would highly recommend this experience. It might not be the cheapest quad biking, but its definitely the most professional and well worth every penny! Just note - try to avoid wearing white clothes as you WILL be covered in orange/brown dust by the end of the trip!! Enjoy! :)"

We booked pretty late the night before but they were happy to accommodate us, and it ended up being only my girlfriend and I in the group. We were out with Mohammed who was a top guy - really happy and friendly. Beautiful scenery, crossing rivers, winding through tiny villages with cute kids who seem to have their day made if you wave back to them (and watch out for the chickens!), breathtaking views of the Atlas Mountains, and a great way to escape the money-grabbing madness of the medina for a while and see a very different side to Marrakech. I've been on lots of different tours previously and I really appreciate it when the people are lovely, put in the effort to make sure you enjoy it and dont let you feel like you're just a paying number (which happens depressingly often). From Marc picking us up, the people at the office, Mohammed on the tour and Marc's lovely wife dropping us off - we were made to feel really welcome, and this just adds to the experience.Top trip."

The journey to the site was easy, although it would have helped if the driver had had a list of names or some ID to show we were getting in the right vehicle as at first it seemed like he was trying to sell us a trip! When we got to the centre, everything was very slick and we were given protective helmets etc and a safety talk. It had rained heavily a couple of hours before we set off so, despite the waterproofs, we got completely soaked within a few minutes of being in the buggy! Stopping in the Berber hut was very welcome for some hot mint tea and a pancake and was also a great way to get to know the other people in our group.

We then went on to the Berber village and were lucky enough to see a wedding! We were shown around a mud hut and given pancakes and mint tea. We had lots of water throughout the whole trip as it was so hot which was such a blessing. We then got taken to the well and were told of life living in a Berber village before heading back to base camp. Overall, such an underated trip when in Morocco, highly highly recommended!

Our group consisted of one guide, a lady with two young sons and two couples (including us) which was a nice size and proved that it is an activity suitable for all ages.I don\u2019t repeat the same experiences very often but in this case, it would be top of my list for any future visit to Marrakech."

I end up seing so much more than what i tough. All this trip was well planed and well executed by a perfect driver who felt more like a travel buddy then a stranger driving us around. I can't wait to come back and try the 5 days experience!Thanks Dune & Deserts"

We were picked up on time from the hotel and driven directly to the Palmerie area of Marrakech where we met up with other members from another group who were also participating in this group activity. Our driver could not speak english so not much communication there or back but that didnt matter as he was only there to drop and pick usThe local guides (despite not being able to speak much english) were excellent and we had a wonderful 1.5hours of camel riding including a short stop for some wonderful mint tea and crepes at a local house.Our overall experience of the camel ride...was nothing short of excellent and a must do!!"

First off we were picked up by the instructor from our hotel and driven to the dunes, after going through the T&C's we got changed into our racing gear and set off for our 2hr journey through the dusty, unpredictable turns off the desert area. Great instructor, always checking to see if we were okay and giving us great advise on how to handle the buggy etc. To be fair it would have been better if there was more twists and turns and an actual desert, but im being picky as i did quad biking in Egypt where the curcuit was far more rougher and tougher..But all in all, a pretty good adventure, being 30 years of age, i still felt like a kid hitting the pedal to the metal! Mid point we were treated to crepes and some mint tea in an old traditional house in the middle of the desert, we were made to feel very welcome and took many pictures.Would defo recomend to anyone who goes to Marrakech"

We called the night before to book the half day quad adventure and was told \"no problem\" be outside the Cafe de France in the main square at 9am. We were collected on time and taken outside the city to a facility with the equipment. We were given a form to fill out and some mint tea. We paid (in cash as there is a 4% cc charge). We were then given a clean balaclava, a modern clean and comfortable helmet, some goggles, and some gloves. We were given a little explanation of the rules (follow the leader and leave a gap of 15m), hand signals, a lesson on the controls, and some safety advice. We then did some slow serpentine turns and the guide assesed our ability and chose an appropriate order. We then set off at a slow pace and travelled though some wonderful landscapes. We passed local outcrops of people, sheperds with their sheep, men and women working in the fields, a construction crew errcting a power line tower, and local kids. Most of the time it was just us, the trail and great views. The paths were fairly easy going with only a few potholes to navigate. The most challenging part was going up a steep rocky hill where we had a water break and a chance to take some pictures. We had a few chances to open up the throttle on some back roads but overall this was very well organized and safety was a priority. We had some tea and pancakes in a berber hut which was a nice rest. When we got back we were dusted off with some compressed air and then taken back to the main square. Overall this was a nice experience."

Dunes & Desert Exp laid on suitable transport to/from their headquarters, which wasn\u2019t too far from Marrakesh and in perfect quad biking territory. The staff who greeted us were all very friendly and multi lingual and made us feel at home with some refreshing mint tea. After suitably kitting us out with good quality head gear we were given a tutorial/practice of the bikes and then off we went at a decent pace into the rock deserts following tracks, dusty roads and occasionally the rougher stuff, which was all a blast with a couple of entertaining instructors/guides. Water breaks were provided. We passed through villages too, including relaxing inside one home with wonderful \u2018berber whiskey\u2019 and a sweet pancake. Overall the trip was superb and faultless, especially at such a good price with a very well organised company. We enjoyed every minute and I would highly recommend this excursion to anyone with an adventurous spirit who is also keen to experience the wilds of Morocco and its people.

Small added touches - like the free provision of parkas to shield our clothes from the dust, free transfers from our accommodation, and a high pressure air blow-down afterwards to take the dust off our pants/shoes/bags - were appreciated and set this experience apart from the rest.

We walked through villages where everything was going on on the street: from metalworking to whisker shaving. We paid a little extra to visit the inside of a family's home, and saw mum making bread in her dark, smoky little kitchen.

They are actually cheaper than the most of the other desert tours and that's probably because you share the tour with more people (our group had 12 people). And the van that took us around was very new and nice, and we were lucky that people in the group were very nice and fun. So we had a fabulous time. Our tour guide was awesome: Yusaf! They will not take you to go shopping nor anything like that and they won't even ask you for tips, but since the whole tour was so nice, we did tip the guide & the driver. We had a really great time! Camel ride was so fun but a bit painful to be honest, and sleeping in the tent could be cold (make sure you dress warm and highly recommend you to bring your own warm sleeping bag, too bad I didn't). Also, make sure you wear gloves, warm scarf, tuque (warm hats) and above all, warm socks and even probably hiking boots or shoes that keep you warm. And then enjoy the stars, the sand dunes :-)Their website is www.moroccanviews.com"

However, it's a 3-4 hour experience and even though we experienced heavy rain and it was cold we had a great time. The guide was very good and I had heard others complaining about similar trips which only last an hour. Would recommend as a fun experience that gets you quad biking in the rock desert."

            "review": "Fabulous tour - worth every cent. On our recent visit to Marrakech, we shopped around for a two night three day tour of the desert. There are many tour operators in the Medina around the Djema El Fena. Everyone quoted the standard 950 dirhams for the three day tour which included one night at a hotel, one night in the desert, breakfast & dinners. Some would reduce it to 900. Now it was a question of choosing the best operator. We decided to go with Hilali tours as he seemed more genuine and offered to provide me with a 4WD instead of the normal camel trek to the sand dunes as I had a bad back. I was a bit skeptical about this as most others refused to make any commitments about providing a 4WD.The next morning Mohammed arrived to our apartment promptly at 7 A.M and drove us to his office where a bigger vehicle awaited us. It was a fourteen seater which was filled up with others some of whom had booked the tour with other operators & some with Hilali tours. The driver Mr Youseff was a very nice gentleman who always made sure that everyone was comfortable. He couldn't speak English but spoke through another French speaking interpretor. My husband who was sitting at the rear end of the vehicle was suffering from travel sickness and Youseff would enquire every now & then if he should stop the vehicle and then he moved him to the front which really helped.After visiting Ourzazate, Ait Ben Haddou, the Kasbahs & the rose valley we stopped at a nice hotel for the night. Each of us were allocated a nice room with attached bath and a comfortable bed. The dinner was superb, the best chicken couscous that I've eaten, followed by fruit which was followed by plenty of music & dance entertainment by the staff of the hotel.The following morning after a lovely breakfast at the hotel we took off on the tour. We visited the Berber villages walking through a farm to the carpet weaving Berber co- operative where we were shown how carpets are woven, a couple of members purchased some lovely carpets & we moved on. Stopped for lunch at a nice place and after a lovely drive stopping and visiting some more attractions we reached our Merzouga hotel where we were refreshed with Mint tea. A string of camels awaited for the rest of the passengers in our van and as promised a 4WD awaited me. We took off to the sand dunes. The 4WD got stuck once in the sand and I had to walk a bit while the others came along on their camels. We got their at sunset, watched the sunset and sat around the tents on low round tables lit with lamps. A delicious tagine dinner and fresh fruit was served. Very romantic, very beautiful! Again we were entertained with some music on the drums. Then we were all shown our tents. Bedding & warm blankets were provided, we crept in & slept well. Next morning at 6 A.M we returned to the hotel for a nice breakfast. We took a taxi from Risani arranged by Youseff and left for Meknes while the rest of the group returned to Marrakech.All in all it was a very beautiful & most comfortable tour which was worth every dirham.Most highly recommended.Merzouga"

A driver picked us up from the riad, we had a quick safety briefing when we got there, paid and got on our quad-bikes. It was fun driving up and down hills, in mud (yeah you will get dirty), gravel and soil, and having mint tea in a berber house was a nice touch. The guys there are really nice and professional. Highly recommended!"

We had a really nice guide named Mohammed who knows the area really well and he was really safe. I saw so many little humble Berber villages which allows me know what it is like outside the buzzling centre of Marrakech. They seem to be very friendly people, everyone flag a hand when we pass, the women were courteous and put a smile when we need to pass. I also saw so many sheeps (the main meat in Morocco other than chicken) and donkeys, they are the cutest thing!! We had lunch midday in one of the villages and I truly had the best chicken tagine there compared to the one I had the night before in the famous touristy restaurant. It made me want to learn how to cook it!.My only criticism is that I wish my nice guide speaks more English as I would love to ask him many questions. But he was wonderful, caring and really tried to communicate regardless :)I also think that tourst should be reminded that the trip will be in the rock dessert instead of smooth sand dunes as i think many misunderstood :)Overall experience is great and i would come back for more"

The \"desert\" we were taken to did not have endless, smooth peaks of orange sand. It was more like a dried up, deserted area right out of Marrakech before you hit the mountains. The tour guide (who spoke very little English) took us to a Berber village in the \"desert\". The second we climbed down from our camels, we were swarmed by children from the ages of 3-10 begging for money. They kept pulling at my arm to get my attention which made me feel uncomfortable. We walked into the village and had a small snack prepared by one of the women who lives in the village. She made us Moroccan tea and grilled crepes. This was a great experience. She was so nice and it was quite interesting to see how they lived. After we finished, we went to get back on the camels where we were again bombarded by the children begging for money. It was raining so the \"desert\" became quite muddy and the camels had a hard time getting back on to their feet (took a good 20 minutes). Our tour guide got into a squabble with one of the locals and I had no idea what going on but they were about to throw punches! The local kid even picked up a large rock and went after our tour guide (he never ended up hitting him). Obviously, no one understood what the disagreement was about but it was quite scary as this went on for a good 10 minutes. I must say, our tour guide was definitely trying to diffuse the situation but it still made all of us on the tour uneasy. We finally got all of our camels to their feet and headed back to home base. The tour lasted about 3-3 1/2 hours. Overall, I give the experience 3 out 5. The poor weather was out of anyone's control but the disappointing \"desert\" and unexpected squabble during our tour was a turn off. The camels were also rather dirty. Was it a once in a life time experience...definitely. Do I regret doing this tour...no. But there are probably other desert camel rides that can top this!"

I would recommend these guys for activities as they are much better than other companies doing similar things. As an example, we went on a buggy ride with another company (I think their name was 'Touareg') and their service was poor compared to Dunes; the people were unfriendly and the ride was very boring.Thanks and enjoy."

I was particularly mesmerized by the colour on the doors and wished that we could have stopped at some places and took pictures, but the team was big and so could not, which is understandable.The hospitality offered was very good also."

Communication and payment of the deposit was easy and emails were responded to quickly. Whilst the primary European language spoke in Marakech is French, communication in English was excellent.They sent a driver to pick us up at a local supermarket, far easer than trying to find our riad, who was very friendly and informative. After arriving at the village on the outskirts of Marrakesh where the quads were based, we were given a drink of tea.As it looked like it might rain we were kitted out with waterproofs; while these were not very attractive they were comfortable and kept us warm (it didn't rain). It's worth pointing out that even if you are hot sitting around, don't underestimate the cooling effect of being on the move, sometimes at quite a good speed. Also your feet can get muddy and no gloves are supplied.We were two on one quad, pilot and passenger, and after a briefing and basic competence test we were off, following the tracks that cris cross the scrubland and we're rocky desert beyond. Our route took us through a palmeri and through several Berber villages to a small hill for a water stop (cool mineral water supplied). After meeting some local children, taking some photos and the opportunity to take in the landscape from this raised viewpoint. We set off again using a different route back towards the base, stopped off at a very basic Berber house where we were served tea and honey drizzled pancakes and had the opportunity to see how they live in these remote villages. We then returned to base and were driven back to our pickup point.The quads were quite powerful but stable and very simple to drive, even two up, with plenty of room for the passenger. All in all a thoroughly enjoyable morning and a great way to see the 'countryside' around the city and to do something a little different."

I contacted 'Dunes & Desert Exploration' through the internet and had a very helpful correspondence with them (options ranging from a single tandem flight up to a full week training course). We were picked up close to our Riad by Marc at 8:30 AM and driven to the take off location some 40 km outside Marrakech where we met with the very experienced instructors and other 'students'.I made a well guided solo flight and a instruction tandem flight until 1:00 PM. Time for a fantastic lunch with a local family, close to the flying spot. Due to thermic conditions less suitable for inexperienced flyers, we stayed at the house until 4:00 PM. Wind conditions became unsuitable for further flying and did not improve so we left the flying spot at approximately 18:00 PM. This is typical for paragliding, you have to have some luck with the weather, which is overall very suitable for paragliding at this location.Make sure you take water, sunscreening stuff, a pair of jeans, a cap/hat and suitable shoes (and gloves when you're flying) and you're all set for fine day away from the crowds in Marrakech."

The quad bikes worked perfectly and you could really pick up some speed in parts of the desert terrain - it gets REALLY dusty so wear some old clothes and be prepared. They provided mineral water which was very welcome.Highlight: driving through several tiny settlements in the middle of the desert - quite incredible to witness adults and children living in such harsh conditions. This really was authentic and having pancakes and tea in a local's home gives you a glimpse of what their homes are like.Gripe: quite expensive because Marrakesh is generally really cheap."

Just what I was hoping for and the best value for money trip/thing we did in Marrakech.My female friend was not convinced when I booked this (I did the panning) She\u2019s a very short Asian girl and insisted being booked as a passenger on my bike rather than driving her own. (Probably for the best as she\u2019s an awful driver!) As soon as we started she loved it, and was taking photographs as we drove along, though I wouldn\u2019t do this as her camera is clogged with dust and probably dangerous. By the end she was hanging on round my waist as we where going faster.The bikes where good standard, wet clutch, automatics, witch I found very easy to drive. Quite large, enough power, good tyres etc. (My friends parents own a farm so I\u2019ve driven geared one's before). If you\u2019re generally a good driver I don\u2019t think you would have any problems with these automatics.We got the helmets provided and a safety talk and description on how to drive etc. Then a slow drive doing zig zags so they could check we got it. Started at moderate speed, then got faster as the trip went on. To quite a fast speed. The other people on our trip where a group of French lads about the same age as us. Guessing they tailor the speed to the group as I read other peoples reviews on here before we went who took kids etc and seemed to enjoy it. We probably got up to 40-50mph at some points, at least it felt that fast, though also felt safe with the guides, the 2 guys where very good. Obviously slowing right down for villages, pedestrians, etc.The trek itself was good, driving on sand, through dried river beds, at bit of disserted gravel road, through villages etc. We stopped for a drink of water on a small rocky hilltop with great views. Then a small baber house for mint tea and a crepe/pancake thing. The 2 instructors nipped of to pray, while we where there. Which wasn\u2019t awkward at all and we just chatted between our selves for what seemed like a couple of minutes. Good bit of culture actually. Then back to base. We got to see a number of villages and a taste of what its really like in these small hamlets/villages in the dessert and all the little kids waving etc at you.Just a warning - you get quite dusty, I would book this towards the end of your trip, so you can just wash your clothes when you get back. I wore thin cargo/combat trousers and a long sleeved t-shirt.Did Marrakech by air in the morning which was also very, very good, and would recomend that as well, though its more pricey."

We were given a demonstration of the Quad bikes before being issued with a snood, helmet & goggles. The guide got the three of us to follow him so that he could see we was comfortable on the bikes. What then followed was a really enjoyable ride through the desert, as the guide could see we were doing ok we picked the speed up, which was excellent! I was at the back of the four and there was dust everywhere which only heightened the sensation of speed. We stopped up a steep incline for a cold drink before setting off again. Going through the small villages was a real contrast to the hustle and bustle of the City. We then stopped for tea, pancakes & a chat at a locals house. We continued our journey through the desert before reaching base. The bikes were in great condition & the guides couldn't have been more helpful. We was then given a air-hosing down before being dropped back off at our apartment. The whole day was fantastic, just remember to wear old clothes as they will end up covered in red dust.One note for the Dunes & Desert team, they should consider a photo service where you can purchase photos of the day as it was difficult getting pics on the move. I would have definitely bought some action shots!I would 100% recommend this trip, the best thing I did in Marrakech.Danny"

I have ridden quad bikes from a young age and was a little worried at the start that the pace would be a little too slow and boring, but we were soon speeding through the sand dunes and at some points I was even struggling to keep up! The route that we took was really interesting and combined rock desert terrain with tracks through the villages. We stopped to take photos at about half way and then on the way back stopped in one of the villages for some mint tea and pancakes...a lovely way to finish a great morning. All in all a great trip although don't expect to be riding the quads for a full half day - in total it was more like 2 hours plus the stops, transfers and instruction etc. TIP - take some sweets with you if you want to be very popular with the local children who will want to stop and 'high five' you as you pass the villages."

            "review": "Excellent Trip. I would recommend it to both beginners and more experienced riders alike.. I travelled to Marrakech with my Girlfriend in August 2011. Even before we left the UK, I had booked the half day quad biking excursion into the rock desert for both of us. I paid the deposit over the internet, and paid the remaining balance on the day of the excursion. I have driven quad bikes many times in the UK, and was really looking forward to the experience of driving them through the desert. I was not let down!!We were collected from our hotel (Riu Tikida Palmaraie) by two genuinely nice guys named Marc and Omar. Both of these guys had a fluent grasp of the English language and the conversation flowed between us all the way to our destination. Once there, we were given a brief safety talk, and were supplied with helmets, balaclavas and goggles for our own protection.20 minutes or so into the excursion, we were divided into 2 groups. The group I was placed into contained just four riders (me, my girlfriend and another couple), whilst the other group was slightly larger (a few of whom were younger people sharing a quad bike with their parents). Each group was given their own instructor/guide and the two groups took their seperate routes.We stopped a couple of times throughout the morning for water, and were even treated to mint tea with pancakes and honey during our second stop.Once the excursion had finished, we were able to have a quick wash from all the dust, and we were returned to our hotel without a problem.On the whole, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend this company to anyone! Both myself and my girlfriend felt as though we had been well looked after and were treated fantastically well by all of the personnel involvedI would gladly repeat this experience and would use this company again if i ever decided to return to Marrakech."

            "review": "Amazing experience. We booked the half day quad biking excursion by email and paid the deposit before we left the UK, and paid the balance the day of the excursion. Not sure whether I would enjoy the quad biking - it was really booked more for my husband and 15 year old son, but thought I'd just tag along to see what it was like. None of us had been quad biking before. We were given balaclavas to wear and a helmet and goggles, and were given a quick explanation of how the bikes work. We were then given the opportunity of trying them out before we started the excursion, and were divided into 2 groups. We were with a young couple, plus the instructer, so there were 6 of us in total. The other group had some younger children in it, and I assume they must have been passengers rather then drivers. They took a different route. We got up some good speeds and although I have no idea how fast we were going, it was fast enough and very exillerating. We stopped half way on a high point and took off our helmets, were offered water by the guides and took some photos. We had passed through a lot of villages on the way, and it was interesting to see the traditional way of life, that was evident even though we were only passing through.Stopped off at a local house for pancakes with honey and mint tea. The other group were already there. Overall it was great, and I would definitely recommend this company and the excursion. Even though I'd never quad biked before it was great and I loved it. They really look after you and we felt very safe and had an amazing time. Worth every penny."

The country side was beautiful, the quad bikes machines were in excellent shape, we stopped in a Moroccan house made of clay and the people were very friendly, etc.We had lot of fun with my friends and the guides. They don't speak perfect English but we could easily communicate with them and that was great because we learned little beth of Arabic.I give them the best rate because it was easy to book on Internet, the organization was perfect and the excursion was great.That's the best I did in Marrakech!

So very glad that we did. The cost was about \u00a3100 per person less to be a passenger. We were given full protective gear. One of our members realized that she felt a little claustrophobic with the full helmet. So she was given a half helmet. They were brilliant with her. We set off after full instructions were given. We were then given about a 15 minute lesson to make sure that we were happy with driving the Quad. we drove for about an hour then stopped and admired the views and drank some water. Set off again and drove for about another hour then we stopped in small village. Here we met some of the locals. One very kind lady saw how hungry one of our daughters were and brought out some Paw Paw Fruits and bread. We were amazed they were so friendly. So we stopped for a bit and chatted to the locals. We took some sweets with us and handed these out they went down a storm!!! We were also provided with a chocolate bar which delighted our kids no end!After some more time driving we stopped to have lunch. To be honest when we booked this the kids were a little unsure about this part!!!The family could not have been anymore welcoming. There were many bottles of water and cola to hand. We ate a small salad and bread. Which we first thought was the lunch but turned out to be the starter!! We were then given a very very large dish of Cous Cous chicken and vegetables. This was very tasty delicious. Then We were brought a selection of melons. Finally mint tea to finish!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We were amazed with the food.We thought that the conversation might be a little difficult. But we had such a laugh with them. They made us all very welcome in their family home. Thank so very much for letting us share that experience with your family! PS sorry about spilling the coke!! PPS Sophie still hungry!!! She never stops that girl...We finished the trip back at base about 4.30pm. What an amazing day. We were so very well looked after. WE had one guide to our party of five. He was brilliant. I felt a little sick due to the heat it was in the 40`s but he made sure that we had regular stops, that I had plenty of water and felt ok. We also stopped at natural springs which was a welcome relief. Great to paddle in, very cool and refreshing.We went over varied terrain. From very rough to some roads. Never did we get board, this has to be one of the most amazing experiences that we have ever had. They don't speak much English but the do try very very hard. You will pleasantly surprised. We had no credit card to pay before we got there. but they met us at the hotel and took a deposit. paid the rest on the day. We looked at quad biking when we got home. But to be honest we wont be doing it here. we paid \u00a3100 for the day back in England \u00a369.00 for ONE HOUR!!! We would go back any-day and try the rest of the trips. Well worth the money. DON'T BOOK WITH THE HOTELS THEY CHARGE \u00a365.00 FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS!! NO WHERE NEAR AS MUCH FUN!!PLEASE CONTACT US TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO HELPLISA AND ADAM BOOTHlisalashes123@hotmail.co.ukWE CANT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THE BEST TIME THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD WE WILL BE BACK!!!!!!!!!!!"

Picked up on time in air con mini bus. Quad bikes, safety equipment and safety briefing all first class. Duration was about three hours with stops for drinks and a snack, well over two hours driving, my older teenage kids loved it. Guides were helpful and really friendly.Highlight of the holiday. Would do full day next time.Camels were a little bit disappointing after that. Was ok and probably worth doing, It was a busy day and took ages to get everyone on board. About 90 mins on the camel and again stopped for drink and snack with the locals. Take some water with you on this one, as unlike the quad ride, none was supplied. Would definitelyuse this company again."

It was absolutely the best day of our trip and we couldn't recommend it enough!! The team picked us up from our hotel and took us to their base (which was a great adventure in itself!!) then we had a whole morning on the bikes- travelling through nearby villages, stopping off for tea and traditional pastries, and experiencing the breathtaking desert. The team were all very good fun, and the amount of time we spent on the quads was exceptionally good value for money- all in all a superb morning!We then were taken back to our hotel by the team and then collected for the afternoon session of camel riding. Getting dressed in traditional clothing added to the experience, and once again the guide was great fun. Again, a great price for the amount of time we got to spend on the camel, riding through the desert!Anyone planning a trip to Marrakesch must book a trip with Dunes and Desert- great value for money, great team and overall a really great experience!We look forward to using you guys again if we ever plan another trip to Morocco!Fatima and Mohammad(!)"

Did the half day quad excursion and it was a fun experience driving through the Palmeraie and the Berber villages. There are stretches of the route where you can go at a (relatively) high speed and get REALLY dusty (where you can't see a thing but the dust cloud in front of you created by the quad in front) but it all added to the thrill and fun of the ride! The only minus for me was that the 'guide' didn't speak any English and so it was a purely driving experience for me which can get a bit boring without someone explaining along the way. Would have been much better if the guide at least speaks 'some' English and was able to provide basic information when we stopped at various points on the way."

            "review": "Do not pass up this tour!!. We went on an overnight excursion with Mark and his crew with 4 other couples and can easily say it was one of the best trips we've ever been on. Even though we only had a 24 hour excursion planned, our itinerary was packed full and seemed twice as long as what it was. Here is what our group did so you can get an idea of what you can expect (although there are many options to choose from!):In the morning, we were picked up from the airport in two SUVs. Our luggage was secured to the top and wrapped in rain-proof tarps, so no worries for the rest of the trip. Our first leg was driving up through the ancient villages in the hills, on our way to the tallest point of civilization in Morocco. The scenery along the way was amazing and the guides provided an excellent history and cultural lesson to give us more context around what we were seeing. Upon arrive to the Atlas mountain village we took donkeys up to the highest point in the village. I probably wouldn't ride donkeys again because I'm a pretty large guy, but it was a very unique experience! Lunch was served on the roof of the highest point of the village with stunning views of the Atlas mountains and the villages below. Food was excellent and everything was served very traditionally.More driving through fantastic scenery brought us to a sunset camel ride (with the largest camels I've ever seen). We rode right to the tent compound where we were to spend the night. The compound was amazing, and we were treated like royalty. All food was included but drinks were purchased if needed. There were wood buring fires and a whole courtyard for us to hang out in all night if we wanted (it was a private compound to our group of 10). The tents were extremely luxurious and more than what we expected. The next morning we had breakfast and a quick visit to a nearby village family to learn a little bit about the typical living conditions and family life. We ended the tour with some off roading in the surrounding dunes - a great way to wrap things up. Then we were dropped off right near our hotel. Perfect.One of the best parts about the tour was Mark and his crew. He and his team of 3 others made the trip easy, comfortable, and exciting - everything you want with an organized tour. We never had to lift a finger, everything was taken care of. The best part is that he and his wife Paule who organized our trip, accompanied us at dinner a couple nights later when we were staying in downtown Marrakech. That is a great indicator of guides that truely care about giving their customers a personal and amazing experience, not just making a living. So...get outside of the souks and city walls and experience all that surrounding Morocco has to offer - a trip to Marrakech is not complete without it!"

While I did not make the reservation myself I can say that they were very professional in handling the reservation. We were picked up by a small bus from our hotel in Marrakech. The drive took no more than 20 minutes and got us in the middle of nowhere until we noticed a large number of quads standing outside the building. We got a quick lesson in handling the quads and got all the proper materials (helmet, goggles,facemask <-- these were all washed properly!!) needed for the trip. We started slow to get aqcuainted with the quads. And after 10 minutes we were already underway.I will not spoil the entire trip. The greatest element of the trip is to get to know all these exciting surroundings & people in an awesome way. We had 2 instructors with us driving along and maintaining the pace. In the beginning some persons were slowing the group down. The instructor noticed this and separated us in a faster and a slower group and we got off to a better start. The instructors were very, very kind and made the tour that much better to enjoy.I highly recommend Dunes & Desert to anyone who wants a welcome distraction from the souks. I must however emphasize that the Quad trip is not meant for the sole purpose of racing. You will have moments with some serious speed, but all in all it is a trip meant for discovering the beautiful surroundings the trip has to offer."

To be fair, that might well be the case, maybe I was in a bad group. I've ridden an ATV 15-20 times before, and although no expert I'm used to other motorized vehicles and prefer speed. I was travelling with 3 others who had never ridden an ATV before, and whilst the scenery was amazing and the guides were really good the lack of speed really killed it for me. I would advice you to ask them to be in an advanced group, and if that's not possible to maybe contact another company. I realize a lot of the way is riding through villages and crossing places were animals and small kids are, but a long portion of the allows for full-throttle driving but on this trip it simply was not possible.Oh, and I was on the 1/2 trip."

Their joy was infectious and the best part of the trip to Morocco was the part we spent with them, in their care. The drivers (separate from the Guides) were very friendly and professional, and excellent drivers (relatively smooth rides over rough roads). Marc was full of suggestions, even helping us book a dinner (for when we returned to Marrakech) at a very good, traditional restaurant.

We drove over the Atlas mountains, through the Draa valley and into the desert. The landscapes were breathtaking! Although we spent quite an amount of tim in the car every day the children did not get bored, and the places chosen to spend the night were very relaxing.All in all a well planned route (planned by D&D) with stops at interesting places.

They punctually picked us up at a pre decided location. We were taken outside the city to their office. Their quad bikes are clean and well maintained. After a qucik introduction, we were off. We passed 3 terrains - rock desert, palm groves and small villages. We made two stops, on a hillock with stunning views and in a berber villaged for mint tea and pancakes. This was a very fun way of going off road and enjoying the outskirts of the city. I was an absolute beginner and could not keep up with others. After riding as a passenger for half the trip, the instructor, Ridwan took me and my friend separately, riding at a slower speed to enable me to drive. Had it not been for his efforts, I would not be able to enjoy this adventure at all. All in all, a professionally run company with very helpful and friendly staff!"

We were met at our Riad at 8.30 am by our guide \"Norrie\", we were taken about 1 hour in a 4 wheel drive vehicle out to the Ourika Valley where we began our trek. We trekked for 5 hours with short breaks and had tea in a berber village house and then lunch in another. We saw no tourists the entire day and entered a truly different world. Our guide spoke perfect english and gave us a great insight into berber life, he loved his job and this was evident the whole day. He geared the day totally to our walking requirements and if you want a non-touristy experience that is unforgettable and great fun, then go with this company, at the end of the trip our berber was as good as his scottish!"

            "review": "Run Your Business Professionally. My fiance and I had scheduled two excursions with Dunes & Desert, one horseback riding and the other a quad excursion. When the driver came to pick us up for the horseback riding excursion, he told us that we had to pay $1,125 dollars immediately. This was of course $1000 more than what we were supposed to pay. After about 15 minuets of back and forth gestures (the driver spoke neither French or English) we were on our way. The horseback riding turned out to be a pleasurable experience.For the second excursion, we wanted to pay by credit card in order to avoid the same issues we had the previous day. We asked if we could come to the office and pay there. We were told that this was not an option because their TPE machine was not working and the only other option available was to pay n cash. We then cancelled the excursion well in advance of the scheduled rendez-vous. However, again there was a lack of communication and the driver came to pick us up. We obviously did not show because we had cancelled. We received a nasty email from someone and Dunes blaming us for making the driver and the other guests wait for thirty minuets. This is obviously not a business run by professionals. The individuals charged with dealing with clients should be polyglot and they should have the capacity in place to accept various types of payment methods. Communication between office staff and field staff should be improved to avoid any complications in dealing with clients. Furthermore, office staff should regularly check emails and other communications in order to avoid any inconvenience."

We booked a half day (9am pick up until about 1pm) quad biking excursion through dunes and desert at the end of November 2010. The only negative is that I wish we had booked a longer trip.The guys that organise it are French speaking but emailed details in English with no problem. Our guide on the day was French speaking so I would recommend brushing up before going although he spoke some English.I was nervous about this initially so only booked a half day but I would recommend going for longer. We rode a quad bike each although you have the option of being a passenger as well. Goggles, helmets and overclothes are provided - It gets extremely dusty and can be chilly once up to speed so I would take them up on the offer! Take a backpack with a camera, gloves, water, tissues (just in case!) and maybe extra warm clothing too in the winter. Wear warm layers and sensible shoes!We stopped at a Berber village for sweet mint tea and pancakes for a short while. The terrain is quite desolate but once up on the hills you get amazing views and winding between palm trees and Berber villages is still an experience not to be missed. Children run out to wave and you pass the occasional donkey carrying goods on the roads too."

I would highly recommend using this company for booking any trips in Morocco as every aspect of the trip was amazing. Even if you can find a tour cheaper from a local company, spend a little more and book the right trip with this company. We had our own 4x4 with a great guide. Drove by hundreds of tour buses and vans with tourist who probably paid a little less money and were crambed into a bus or van that couldn't do any of the off roading to the better destinations. Every restaurant that we stopped at (pre-arranged) and accomodation we used were outstanding. They have done their research and only use the best options available. We even had a question midway through our tour and they were avaiable by phone and email to help in making sure our experience was everything we hoped it would be.Don't waste your time looking anywhere else. Book your tours with this company.Liam (Canadian traveller)"

We chose to do the day trip to Imlil and Atlas mountains, which for me was unforgetable. It was about 2-hour trip each way, by our personal driver Abdul and then about 45-min with the donkey to a Berber village. We were headed straight to a restaurant in the middle of the mountain with awesome views! They served lamb tagine, which according to my husband was really delicious! Unfortunately I'm vegetarian, so didn't eat any of it, which would probably be one of my criticisms, as they could've checked dietary requirements. But I definetely recommend doing this trip!We also went to Essaouira to do quad biking in the dunes, and this was the highlight of our trip! 3 hours of riding the bikes up and down the dunes, including a couple of really steep ones, which tested our bravery and was an adrenaline rush.The last activity Dunes and Desert organized was paragliding, which was a great experience. The whole experience might seem a little short (10-20 mins) for the money paid and is not for the faint-hearted, but the duration apparently depends on weather conditions. Paragliding is done in tandem with the highly trained and experienced Michel Didriche.All in all I was really impressed by how they organized every detail of the trip starting from Paule's attentive correspondence and organization, to the restaurants they chose for us, our driver Abdul... etc. Our Moroccan trip was quite short but I'm really happy that Marc and Paule made it worthwhile!"

Our guide was very patient and kind. He explained everything to the detail and took us to some nice areas close to the desert. He took us to some small villages to know the way the people live in there. We even visited a traditional home and had fresh mint tea with pancakes.The following day we took a day trip to Ourika valley. Our guide Andy was awesome. He stayed with us all the time. We did some hiking to a nice waterfall, had camel riding and ate in a great restaurant. He also advised us on the best places to visit in Marrakech. Really worth it excursion.

We arrived at the site which was outside of the Medina on a flat outskirts of land near a small farming village.There was a group of seven flying and due to the last two we picked up in the 4x4 being late out of their accommodation the sun had already started to rise by the time we arrived at the site.Nevertheless we took off and Marco was knowledgable about the local area and not only expertly controlled the balloon flight path but also made the flight fun and interesting with trivia and jokes. He is very professional and I felt extremely safe with him in charge of the balloon. We had to land shortly after getting up in the sky as two more arrived late (making a total of seven passengers plus Marco) and Marco descended with precision, picked up the latecomers and had us back in the air in no time.We flew for an hour over the flatland as the wind did not pick up and carry is over Marrakech but the views were spectacular and you were right near the Atlas mountain range which was amazing.Post-flight we walked to the farming village where breakfast was all laid out and was a massive portion for those of us eating (Ramadam month right now so many weren't able to eat with us). After we all received formal certificates and took lots of photos before, during and after the balloon ride.I would highly recommend Marco above the other balloon companies listed as he takes safety extremely seriously and has an employment history as a pilot in Europe over many years so has the required skills and qualifications to fly balloons safely."

As Antonio explained no one feels vertigo on a hot air balloon and he was right. We were picked up from our Riad early in the morning around 5.00am and taken to a location which I cannot name...a stretch of land from where we were served coffee and watched the staff set the whole thing up....once our balloon was all ready we 'boarded' and were off. Taking off was smooth and until I looked down did not realise that we had actually taken off. The whole ride was memorable...an unforgettable experience. The crew (there were two on the balloon with us ) made sure to explain to us what was happening...how the balloon works ...the surroundings (amazing by the way) and what we were to expect. The whole tour took one hour...sometimes we were higher up sometimes we went low...the amount and quality of photos that you take from up there is incredible. Once landed we were then taken to a small village where we were served a typical Moroccan breakfast. All in all this experience is one that I will never forget .

Michel and Antonio looked after us really well. Both my youngest son and I are not the greatest with heights but knowing that these guys were experienced pilots made me feel at ease. We flew up to 3000 feet and the sunrise was spectacular as it slowly illuminated Marrakech in the distance. The main thing I will remember is the contrasting views of the snow capped Atlas mountains beyond the warm orange glow of Marrakech as the sun rose. The flight was rounded with a visit to one of the local villages for breakfast."

An early rise saw us collected from our Riad by Michel personally who drove us the launch site. On arrival there was hot drinks and snacks, a nice touch considering the early start. And a perfect addition when watching the balloon being inflated. The launch site itself is stunning in that it's remote and surrounded by the Atlas Mountains where you watch the sunrise.In the balloon the flight was smooth and once up the beauty of the surrounding area took my mind of the height. You could tell everyone on board was blown away as the silence was only broken occasionally by Michel when explaining ballooning as a process, or the experiences of the Berbers who lived in the villages below. Overall a great experience I would recommend anyone to do."

Thanks to Tripadvisor I had reviewed quite a few HAB operators and found Michel to be very approachable and trustworthy online. Michel picked us up from our Riad early in the morning and we were driven to the outskirts of Marrakech. Even the 4x4 ride in the wee hours of the morning was interesting enough. As the buildings disappeared we went into a field and were greeted with hot Tea and croissants! Only then did I tell my wife that its her Birthday surprise and she was thrilled or what ( it so happens that it was one of her things to do in her bucket list!) We were in the HAB and as it went up in the air it was the most magical experiences.. As you leave the earth behind, the noises disappear and a sense of calm sets in with such magical sights of the mountains,landscapes and Marrakech down below. Watching the sun rise over the Atlas mountains was amazing! I loved the landing too which was real fun!...Afterwards we were taken to a Berber village and were treated to a sumptuous breakfast. Thank you Michel for all the discretion and making this a wonderful experience for us!! it was one of our best adventures in Marrakech!! People - Dont miss it for the world!!"

Just to share an amazing adventure we experienced a few months ago in Marrakech when we visited friends last April for a few days.We had great fun (we hadn't seen our friends for nearly two years) and, although our stay was short (4 days) they brought us to visit so many incredible places in the city.Just to name a few: the Majorelle garden (beautiful plants and trees, the Yves St Laurent house and the museum), the Jemaa el Fna square (cannot be missed, its the heart of the city, full of life, people and animations: food, drinks, monkeys. snakes, singers, musicians, ..... just great to have a crowd bath in the evening before or after diner), the mosk and minaret of Koutoubia (you cannot enter but very nice from outside; you can even go in the evening if too hot during the day -spotlights are on), the Rahba Kedima square (colourful square in the souks where you'll find plenty of spices, handcraft, etc), the Royal Mansour Bar (very nice atmosphere), the Sofitel pool bar (expensive but great), the Rose bar (expensive but excellent music).....But the best was kept for the end! The day before leaving, our friends woke us up very early in the morning (night I should say) and without saying anything took us out of the house.There was a 4-wheel car waiting for us all with a 'Maroc Montgolfi\u00e8re' sign on it! Omg! (I'm scared about altitude!)The guy in the car drove use for about 30km out of the city, then gave us a cup of tea and a few croissants while him and colleagues started preparing ...a huge balloon! the sound was incredible at this time of the night brrrrr pshhhhhhhhhh vrrrroooom after a few cups of tea and a lot of anxiety, they came to get us into the 'cage'... I went there hesitating at each step.The colleague of our driver (his name was Michel -like me- and we learned afterwards he was the founder of 'Maroc Montgolfi\u00e8re') was always reassuring, always checking that we were (as) comfortable (as possible ...I'm speaking about me ;-) Anyway, he succeeded: I was in!And once you are in, no choice anymore, you cant go back! well, I wouldn't have done this for anything sunrise over the Atlas was simply amazing, astonishing, crazily beautiful, so woaww that I even forgot about all my fears I don't remember how long we spent up there. 1 hour? maybe 2 or 3 but time just didn't count ...until we came back down the sadness of being back on earth disappeared very fast. As soon as landing done, we entered a house where a incredible breakfast was waiting for us! we didn't stop speaking of this flight, just an amazing adventure....we are still speaking about it.If you go for it, a must: bring your camera. I hadn't mine and I regret it so deeply!"

He turned out to be a very funny man who then took us for a 20 mins ride into the countryside out of Marrakech, the sun slowly rising over the distant hills.We arrived at a small Berber house where we were offered mint tea and coffee, having met with a another couple of people who had booked for the flight.Within a few minutes we noticed the ballon arriving in the distance, got back into the 4x4 vehicles and drove to the ideal spot to clamber into the balloon basket.The pilot Hamid was a jovial character who made everyone feels at ease and reassure any misgivings we might have had about flying (it was our first balloon flight).And what a treat and an unforgettable adventure it turned out to be.As the balloon rises you are immediately struck by how peaceful and awe inspiring the ascent really is. You quite simply float silently over the surrounding countryside, the rising sun over the Atlas Mountains and the morning mist adding to the magical feel of the whole experience.We flew over Berber farmhouses, dry river beds, shepherds tending to their flocks, gently floating in the morning air in what turned out to be one of the most amazing experience of our lives.All too soon, albeit after good hour flight, it was time to descent and be met by the support team in their 4x4 vehicles.We were then taken to a Berber farmhouse where we were treated to an authentic and substantial Berber breakfast, reliving and discussing our flight experience with the other couples who took part. The drivers then took us back to our various hotels and riads in Marrakech where we were back by late morning.I personally have done many fascinating and fantastic things in my life but an early morning flight over the Atlas Mountains has to be one of the most memorable ever.I would heartily and sincerely recommend anyone looking for an unforgettable and memorable experience to take a balloon flight with Maroc Montgolfi\u00e8re."

Ayoub, the Moroccan guy who was at the booth, was so helpful and friendly. I'm Iraqi and he was excited to meet someone from Iraq who spoke the same language, albeit very different dialect, he took me on his bike after the booking to Medina and invited for lunch then dropped me off close to my Riad. During that, we just talked about differences and similarities in our countries which was an added bonus to a great experience :)"

The man in charge, Michel, has decades of experience in ballooning and from past reviews gave me the impression of the epitome of professionalism. Other companies I saw on you tube appeared a bit gung ho and a bit too relaxed. This company does not include a camel ride in the price, which was a plus as I had no interest in it. Our rendevous was in the middle of a wheat field just before sunrise and the setting was beautiful. Michel welcomed us warmly and the ballooning began. Great experience with michel providing interesting chat throughout. Breakfast at a village house wasn't fine dining but it filled a hole after a 0540hrs start. All in all a really good experience provided by a very professional chap."

Getting up at 4:50 AM while on holiday is not everyone\u2019s idea of how you should start the day, But an exception to this is to go Ballooning at the edge of the Atlas Mountains. We were picked up at our Hotel by Michel Ries, the pilot and with quite a bit of back roads and off-roading, arrived at our launch site. Whilst it was a cloudy day, we ascended through the clouds and witnessed a spectacular sunrise. From our Launch location, other balloons had also set off, but none ventured through the clouds. Had a very gentle landing (with the Basket remaining upright), followed by breakfast in a Berber village before being dropped back at our Hotel. Michel is an extremely competent and experienced pilot and gave us a wonderful morning\u2019s adventure. "

Can't fault the crew or the experience - our pilot even landed the balloon onto the back of the trailer! However, we declined the offer of a post-flight camel ride (extra 100 MDh each) - while the other group members went off on the camels, we were driven back to Marrakech - missing out on our Berber homestay local delicacy breakfast, and were back in the Djema el Fnaa by 9.30am."

I am mostly impressed by the fact that he is more safety driven than money driven. We had given more than half $ as a deposit. He couldve said \"i'll still fly since i already got paid\" Instead, upon arrival to Marrakech, he kept in contact with me via email and even had the pilot call me the day before to let me know that it was unsafe to fly due to the wind. Their website says that safety is their priority and it is 100% true. I received a refund for my deposit within 24 hours. Although it was disappointing that we had to cancel, i am very pleased that there are honest and cautious people out there.

We decided book the adventure ride.It is an amazing experience. Michel Ries who has nearly three decades of experience in Ballon ride picked us up from our Riad at 6 AM. They start early morning as that is the most suitable time.The pick up was clean and decent 4x4 . Then it is an hour drive to the outskirts of city close to a village. Michel provided information and facts about various places on the way along with history and life of the people in villages. He is doing a great job of giving important employment to local people. They love him. The ride itself is about an hour and you go close to a KM up in the air.At all the times we felt safe because of the expert procedures and skills of the Pilot Michel.It is a beautiful landscape and the view from above and the experience is once in a life time.We landed safe few Kms away and were again promptly picked up by the waiting crew. We were driven to a Berber village. We were skeptical about the breakfast there. But when we entered the Berber house it was so well lit and clean. The breakfast that was layed out looked hygienic and fresh. The taste was excellent. Local breads of different types, olives, olive oil,honey,some spices, etc.It was a healthy breakfast. We were dropped off to our Riad at about 10 AM. So overall about 4 hours. The prices were reasonable and less than any other companies , as we booked direct.I would highly recommend the balloon ride.

We flew the next day.We were picked up at the hotel lobby at 06:00 and after half an hour drive and half an hour of preparring the balloon (which was an attraction on its own) we went up to arrive at 1.000 mtr around 07:00, where we watched the sun appear from behind the Atlas mountains and shed its light on Marrakech. All whilst learning a thing or two about driving a hot air balloon.After an hours flight (the other balloons were already down) we had a soft landing and drove to the village in which one of the workers of Maroc Montgolfiere lives, inviting us for a traditional local breakfast in his own home. Michel informed us this is done every trip, allowing for the local people to make some profit as well. This allowed us to experience the life outside Marrakech and have an understanding of the live's circumstances of local Moroccans (the village where we were invited - no more than 10 houses, did not have electricity untill one year ago).Maroc Montgolfiere is run by Michel Ries, a Belgian pilot with 27 years of experience. Something which allowed him (or gave him the guts?) to fly far above the other balloons. We were very happy that we met Michel at the Jardin Majorelle and will definetely give him a ring next time when we are in Marrakech.To everybody doubting whether this is worth your money - it totally is!"

The fact that Michel has been flying the major balloon festivals around the world for quite some years made us decide to fly with \u201cMaroc Montgolfi\u00e8re\u201d. The fact that Michel is multilingual did help also of course.The years of experience do show. Preparing the balloon for flight was done quickly with an experienced team. Michel answered all our zillion questions, while coordinating the preparations in the meantime.The flight itself was superb, resulting in many many excellent photos.After the flight we had a local breakfast in the house of a Moroccan family (from one of the Crew). Culture shock, but a very nice breakfast & experience indeed.If you are thinking about going up, this is your chance. I know for sure you will arrive back at your Hotel or Tiswa, smiling."

            "review": "Must-do amazing experience. My friends and I were thinking about doing a hot-air ballooning trip, so kept one eye open for deals. Our hotel rep has tried to sell us one that was \u00a3250 per person, which we could not afford, so didn't think that it would be an option.We met Michel outside the Yves St Laurent gardens - he was very friendly and explained all about the trip, answered all of our questions, without pressuring us into it. We had a little think about it and soon decided that the price was very reasonable, and the trip sounded great.We got picked up at 5:15 the morning of the flight, and driven to the air field. Michel answered all our questions about not only the experience, but Marrakech too. He is very knowledgeable. He is a very experienced flyer with over 27 years experience - we all felt in very safe hands with him.Sunrise over the mountains was spectacular - as the sky lit up red and the sun rose, we all knew it was worth every penny. You get a good, solid hour of flying too, so you definitely get your money's worth. Michel explains all about how the flight works, so you really get to understand everything, and he points out interesting sights while you're up there too.After the flight, you go for breakfast with the group to a nearby Berber town, which was great - so nice to see how local people live, and lovely to think how Michel is helping them too. The local people help Michel with his balloon, so his business is great for their community, and he takes it in turns to go to each of their houses for breakfast after.This was such an enjoyable experience, and I can't recommend it highly enough. Thanks Michel for such an amazing trip!"

We met Michel on the first day of our trip outside Majorelle Gardens - he happily explained the experience and having never been on a hot air balloon before, myself and my friend were both reassured by the 27 years flying experience he had! It later came to the light that the price and experience Michel offered was the best one in Marrakech! He happily kept in touch with us regarding which day it would be best to fly and as promised arrived at our hotel at 5am in a registered marked 4x4. We drove to the balloon flying area where we were shown how the balloon was prepared before jumping in and enjoying the beautiful landscape of Marrakech inc the Atlas Mountains at sunrise! Michel was clear and confident the entire journey and we felt completely safe!Another highlight was having authentic moroccan breakfast in the home of a Moroccan villager. We were all given certificates and arrived back at our hotel by 10pm.All in all an absolutely fantastic fun experience which i would happily recommend! Definitely the best bit of our entire trip :)"

I had always wanted to go up in a hot air balloon and I thought that Marocco might be a good opportunity so I started to do some research. I decided to go with Maroc Montgolfiere because Michel (I think), the Belgium pilot, has over 25 yrs experience flying balloons and he also has a helicoptor licence - so I felt really confident about safety. What a treat! It was such fun and really well organised. A surprise highlight was having a traditional breakfast in the home of one of the balloon assistants. Overall a really great morning. So memorable and has left me with great photos."

We got as high as apx 2,500 feet and it was so quiet, so smooth and we felt no wind. At certain elevations, there was no wind and it was like we parked in mid air. I had no trepidation about leaning over the edge of the basket and looking at the ground below. The ride itself was not very long - maybe 40 minutes and maybe only five miles which was a bit disappointing. The balloon operator was excellent - very knowledgeable and his commentary was hilarious. We also got to watch them fill the balloon with air in preparation for our trip. Too much fun.Our tour also included a camel ride which was also very good. The camels were sweet and well trained/mannered. The tour also included a light snack before the balloon ride and Moroccan breakfast afterwards; both were better than expected."

When we arrived in the Berber village we were given pastries, coffee, tea, water, and hot chocolate in a lovely tent.The toilets have clearly been upgraded since some of the other views since it was an extremely clean, new, \"normal\" (British/American style) toilet which was a relief (pun intended).The breakfast was nice with breads, jams, honey, fruits, and eggs.Then we went on the balloon flight, this was wonderful, the captain was very funny and kept us entertained throughout, the rest of the crew all seem to be very friendly and consummate professionals, displaying a light heart and great teamwork.On the way back we stopped for a short camel ride (which was plenty long enough), I'm glad to have had the experience of riding a camel but will endeavour not to again.This experience has so far been the highlight of my trip, I can't recommend it enough."

So I stayed with him on land and watched my family in the air in a very nice view. So this was another opportunity for ME to actually FLY, not just watch. However, the price was much more higher than that in Egypt, but I found that it's almost the same range worldwide, only in Egpyt it was much cheaper, so I decided to take it. We were picked up at dawn from our Riadh promptly, joined the rest of the group, had complimentary pastries and tea while we chatted. They started blowing the balloon when we met our captain, he had great sense of humor and filled the flight with joyful jokes and humor. The scene was beautiful though I expected more greenery, it was more of sunrise in a desert- but it was still beautiful. The ride seemed shorter than expected, too, maybe time flies in happy moments. The staff was so friendly and kind, we had complimentary flying certificates and had tasty breakfast. Later, our group enjoyed a camel ride while we waited coz we've done that a lot in our country, Egpyt. We then returned to our Riadh ready for the rest of an eventful day"

We were picked up at our Riad at 5am and driven in a Land Rover down bumpy roads in the dark to a little tented camp where we were offered coffee/tea and croissants. We then moved to the launch site, the balloon was set up for the flight and before we knew it we were 500ft in the air and rising, eventually about 3,000ft. The views are amazing, even though you are some way from the Atlas mountains there is plenty to see and when the sun comes up it looks stunning with the back drop of the mountains. Our pilot, Hamid, was excellent, he gives off the feeling that he really knows what he is doing, and his humorous commentary, whilst maybe not to everyone's taste, was just a great way to add to the experience. One passenger, who had been very nervous before our flight, seemed to be put totally at ease by him.The balloon ride lasted about 45 minutes, being brought into land on the trailer of the Land Rover by the excellent support team; then it was back to the tented camp for a very tasty Berber breakfast, before the 30 minute drive back to Marrakech, along the roads with interesting sights of Moroccan daily life,The last part of the experience is the camel ride. It seems to get some negative comments but is quite simply a nice addition to the experience. Yes it only lasts 20 minutes, yes you are led round on camels roped together in a train and yes the scenery is bland. But camels are not comfy to ride so 20 minutes is plenty, the camels need to be tied together to keep them from wandering off and you are there for the experience of the ride not the scenery. This is not the main part of the tour, but is a nice addition to complete your day."

There are rides throughout the day, but be sure to take the first one, even though you feel like you're up in the middle of the night. Marrakech by Air will pick you up at or near your hotel or riad. First of all, you get to watch the balloons getting inflated which is amazing in itself. Then you're up in the air in time to watch the earth appear like a mirage as the sun comes up over the Atlas Mountains. I think we were up in the air about an hour, but it seemed to go so much faster! You'll be taking pictures every minute because the scenery changes constantly. Then you get to see the next group take off in the balloon. You're out, they're in and whoosh they're up in the air. By then you realize you're really hungry (although there was a little snack provided before the ride), and you go back to a Berber tent and have a Moroccan breakfast. But wait - there's more! Your next stop is the camel ride. It's fun to watch people get up on the camel and then it's your turn and you find out it's a lot harder than it looks (but the guides are helpful and make sure everyone is safe). The guided ride through palm trees and desert is about half an hour (just enough).The Marrakech by Air staff was wonderful and fun with all facets of our day. It was also enjoyable to meet and talk with others in our group. We had 8 people and we covered about 5 different countries, which is one of the things that makes travel so much fun!Taking the sunrise balloon ride is worth every penny--don't miss it!"

After a short drive (maybe 30 minutes) we arrived at the balloon site as dawn was breaking. There was time for a quick coffee and a pastry while the balloon was inflated, and then we were off. Our ascent was quick and smooth, our pilot a lovely, friendly character- who despite his terrible jokes, put us very much at ease. The flight itself was lovely - some stunning views very early in the morning. Worth the early start and the cost, in my opinion. After the flight (and also the extremely smooth descent and flawless landing) came a bigger breakfast before another drive and a camel ride. In short, loads of fun, a bit silly, but wouldn't have missed it for the world. Thank you for a memorable day."

The pilot made an entire show of it, on the ground but also in the air. He is a real fun guy, but also his co-workers are really friendly. The view is amazing and we really enjoyed when we saw the sunrise alongside the mountains when we were 900m up in the air! It was fantastic! Afterwards we got more breakfast and a short camelride. I normally never do tours because they always sell it as if you are doing a certain tour with only 5 people and then when you show up there are suddenly 60 people and you have to wait in line for every sightseeing stop, but seriously this is totally different!!

All 10 of us clambered into the basket and we were off...climbing to a height of about 900 meters. It was glorious! And not as cold as we thought it was going to be. The sun was rising in the east and the Atlas Mountains lay stretched, cold and serene, as far as the eye could see. The golden desert lay under us, and we even glimpsed a Berber village or two!Hamid, our pilot, was HILARIOUS! He had us in stitches for the whole entire ride which lasted about 45 minutes! It really made it all the more memorable!Then it was back to the tent for more food and then another 30 minute car ride to the next stop. Camel ride! That was great fun, too!

Hamid introduced himself then asked my wife & 2 American girls to lie in the basket as it lay on its side while he was inflating the balloon. The 5 men were as to help hold on to a rope as it rose to vertical then we climbed aboard & crouched inside. When we were told to stand we were amazed to be up & away. Hamid was a great source of information and sense of humour made everybody laugh & enjoy the flight in a relaxed manner. When we landed the crew took pics of us as Hamid signed our certs in Arabic.

So it is with Hamid and the team at Marrakesh by Air \u2013 you just have to do this balloon experience and you have to do it with Hamid to truly appreciate the sublime beauty of both the land and the charm of its people. Beyond just an amazing photo shoot (which it was) this is a sensory experience at every level and with Hamid at the controls a lot of fun. Brilliant!"

My only disappointment, and the reason I'm not giving this 5 stars, is we stayed really quite low the whole trip. The only time we went high was in the first few minutes of flight. That was pretty disappointing. Other than that, great experience."

The experience was unforgettable, largely helped by our pilot who was not only very good as his job, but talked and joked around making it more fun. It's hard to explain the feeling of floating in a hot air balloon, but up in the sky I felt very calm and still. It was fun watching the other balloons in the distance, disappearing into the clouds. We left early in the morning and it was only just getting light as we hopped into our basket (not very elegantly). Unfortunately it was cloudy that morning so the views weren't as good as we had hoped, but no one can control the weather!Great experience, would do it again!"

I thought we would be gliding over Marrakech, no. We drove almost an hour outside of town to the middle of nowhere, dropped outside a Berber home, offered coffee (horrible, it was powdered Nescafe!), waited 45 minutes before we were driven to the balloon. Went up, Marrakesh and the Atlas Mountains were WAY WAY off in the distance. The balloon guide was charismatic but not my type of humor. After the ride, went back to the Berber home, sat outside in a tent and had a pretty bad Berber breakfast, consisting of a lot of fried dough and bread with badly cooked hard boiled eggs, yuck. Waited around too long while the guys put all the balloon equipment away, back in the car for the trip back."

We were collected from our riad at 6am so that we didn't have to walk around so early alone. We drove for about 40 minutes to a small Berber settlement and met with tea and coffee along with pain au chocolate. The crew then started to inflate the balloon which was brilliant to watch. Then the fun really started, we were all helped into the basket and from that point the fun and laughter started! The pilot was so amusing and entertaining and put the nervous first timers at ease, so much so we were in the air and they hadn't realised! The flight was totally brilliant! But the most amazing thing was the skill of the pilot who landed us first time straight in the back of the trailer - this was my third flight and on previous occasions it's been a little bumpy landing in tall crops! We then went back and had a freshly prepared breakfast of local breads, tea and fruit. Then our journey began again to go riding the camels - more fun and laughter with the guides! I would recommend anyone to make time in their trip to undertake this tour. Well worth the money!"

This is one of the best things you'll do in Morocco, no doubt about it. Firstly, it's super well organized: Pick-up at your hotel, coffee/tea and croissants before the start, then the balloon ride itself, then an amazing Moroccon breakfast followed by a little camel ride.The ballon ride is just fantastic and the pilot is downright a stand-up comedian who will have you laughing in tears in 1300m heights. This guy is amazing and has a talent for making you feel really comfortable and safe, yet entertains you like Eddie Murphy in his best times.It is definitely one of the pricier activities you can do in Marrakech but worth every bit in my opintion.

It was interesting to watch the balloon inflate and then time to hop in and off we went. The pilot was entertaining and the flight went very quickly. Beautiful sunrise and views, and a very gentle and skilled landing. The traditional breakfast afterwards was good too. In all honesty, the camel ride could be skipped - it's a lethargic walk around some palm trees, nothing to be overexcited about, but a photo opportunity perhaps? The 5* rating is for the balloon ride and breakfast - well worth it and good value."

The driver picked us up at our hotel and drove us out through off road to the camp site where we had a prebreakfast. The little tent was cute, but there was no heat so were freezing. After the prebreakfast we were brought out to where they set up the balloons. It was incredible to watch the group of men fill up the balloon and well worth standing out in the cold for an extra fifteen minutes. The view from the balloon was incredible as was the Berber breakfast we were taken to afterward. Our group decided to forgo the camel ride as we were pressed for time and taken a camel ride through the desert eariler in our trip. My one disclaimer is that the basket was a little small. They brought nine people plus the pilot, so the quarters were cramped. If your clastrophoboic,I wouldn't recommend this trip."

We were only there for 4 days, and it was a really good use of time , as it starts so early. We were picked up at 5.30am right on time from our riad in a new land rover (sounds dumb to be impressed by that but the general standard of cars in Morroco is appalling). It was great to be out of the city in the stunning arid landscape under stars much brighter than in the UK.The sunrise was stunning, and you can see the second highest mountain in Africa from it. The flight probably wasn't an hour, maybe 45 mins, but it was still worth it. Breakfast was indifferent but hey, thats not why we went. maybe I was just sick of the ubiquitous bread and olives by then."

We didn't get in the air before sunrise because it was too windy, but this group found a protected place and got us in the air over 30 minutes earlier than the other 2 companies operating in the same area. Our pilot was awesome, very funny, spoke fluent French, English, and Arabic. Breakfast in tent was same food as everywhere else in Morocco. Could have done without the camel ride in the Palmerie. Short and pointless. Save yourself $25pp and book directly with the company instead of viator. Cash only when you get back to hotel. We withdrew extra from ATM a couple times to build up the money before the day we took the balloon."

The view had not much, and you will probably just have one other balloon, but still good. I was expecting to \"travel\", like start in one place and end in another, but it was not like that. We went up for some time and that was it. Still, the \"captain\" was a really great man, always making jokes and talking to us, which made it less wierd (since you are in a \"box\" with 4 other people, or around that.After that, we had a big Morroccain breakfast and we turned back to Marrakech.It was a great experience, and if you have the time (and the money), and the will to try it once in your life, I do recommend this one!"

The views and the experience are just fonominal to say the least . Land then after about 1 hour flight and back to the tent for lunch before being brought camel riding . One of the best things about this was our driver/guide for the day and our pilot. These have to be two of the nicest funniest people and just great craic that you could meet .

There are a couple of footholes in the basket and the inside is sectioned off into four sections... is a tight squeeze with a full basket but still enjoyable.Pilot was amusing and kept us entertained for the duration.The berber breakfast afterwards was beautiful, lots of options including veggie and vegan.... one of the best breakie's i've had!The premises where the balloon lifts off and you have refreshments is an actual berber house so prepare yourself for the toilet facilities.All in all a great morning spent having laughs, great food and amazing skyline views of sunrise... a great way to start the day!"

For starters they pick you from the hotel in the morning and take you to the deserted areas and you get some tea and coffe before you ride the ballon. I would recommend you take the first flight so you can see bout the sunrise and when they blow up the ballon. However the pilot is hilliarous and you get to have a great time on it. You ride for 45 minutes. Afterwards you get to eat an traditional marocain breakfast and after it you get to ride the camels. Oh yeah the chauffeur is also really funny making you feel relaxed. They both speak English so that's really good. I know my English isn't the best but I really recommend this experience if you have the time."

We had seen it advertised by an agency but were apprehensive about booking on line with them in case the flight would be cancelled due to wind or weather and we be offered an alternative date rather than our money back. So we looked at the reports on Trip Advisor and decided to go with Marrakesh by Air. This was perfect as they confirmed our place on the following day's flight, but didn't collect the money until they returned us to Marrakesh. The whole experience was great. A pre-flight coffee and croissant in the desert while we waited for the previous flight to land, then we boarded and were away. The pilot, Hamid, was a hoot, quite one of the most extrovert characters we have ever met. He joked the whole way through the flight and could do so because of his experience and mastery of the balloon. I was a little concerned at his choice of landing site - just short of a powerline! I needn't have worried however as he not only put it down in good time, but actually landed it on the transport trailer ( with minor help from the ground crew) After the flight we were served a full Berber breakfast which was very good. Then back to Marrakesh for a short camel ride before being returned to our pick-up points. The whole thing was a great experience and one that we would highly recommend as not only being highly enjoyable but also good value for money ( Dir1990 \u00a3135 each). "

            "review": "Hot air ballooning at the foot of the Atlas mountains is amazing. We arranged this well in advance directly with Marrakesh by Air. Our Riad spoke to them the night before to check everything was okay. There was a suggestion that the weather would not be optimal, but it was our last day so we couldn't change dates.They picked us up from the Riad nice and early (6am). It took a while to pick others up. Mohammed was our driver, and he was hilarious. We were then taken to the breakfast, which was really nice. By the time we finished breakfast it had gone 9.30am. The first group had already been up. We got in when they landed. There were 6 in the balloon, which was fine.Our ride only lasted 30 minutes because of the weather conditions. We were unlucky in this regard, but being up in the hot air balloon is a fabulous experience. The pilot is a great guy. We skipped the camel ride (as we had already done that in the desert). Tips to ensure a great experience:Book the trip for early in your holiday if you can (we couldn't as we were in the desert to start with). Get your Riad to ring them the night before, and rearrange to a later day it if they say that the weather conditions might not be perfect.If you want to see the balloon being inflated, etc. then ask to be in the first group (they take three groups up each morning)Check that no very young children are scheduled to be in your balloon, as this could affect your enjoyment in the balloon.If you take the above tips on board I would not hesitate in recommending Marrakech by Air, and I am sure it will be a highlight of your stay in Morocco."

We were picked up from our hotel in a nice car with seat belts (I say this as some cars we had in Morocco seemed like little deathtraps \u2013 this was not one of them!) and joined a lovely French family on a drive to the ballooning destination.Our driver was very entertaining and chatted to us the whole way, and once we got closer we joined a small convoy (the balloon vehicle and another car of ballooners). We were off the beaten track so it felt like we were off-roading, and the pilot even jumped out of his vehicle and ran alongside ours for laughs.On arrival to a humble base in what seemed like the middle of nowhere, there was a small breakfast and mint tea station which we chilled out at and enjoyed as the team fired the balloon up ready for our trip. Once the balloon was ready, we climbed into the compartmented baskets and took off.The journey in the air was exhilarating. My husband was afraid of heights, but enjoyed the whole thing. Myself on the other hand, held on tightly, even though I'm usually good with heights. The views were amazing, with the Atlas Mountains in the distance. It was nice to see the sun rise, and it was all very tranquil.The pilot was brilliant fun, joking about the quality (or lack thereof) of the basket, taking the mickey out of himself and the rest of us, and generally ensuring everybody was happy and having a good time. He took us up a lot higher than the 3 or 4 other balloons we could see in the distance were, and it felt like we were in the air longer than them too. When we finally landed, we did a 'trailer land', and the balloon was guided into the back of the trailer, rather than dropping to the ground. As the balloon hands did this, the pilot was very humorous, pretending to whip them and spit on them (don't worry, it was all play fun, done in good humour \u2013 no balloon hands were actually harmed!).We then settled back in for Breakfast 2 \u2013 we were given a lovely spread that was typically Moroccan with breads, pastries and mint tea. Perhaps a second breakfast wasn't needed...but it was certainly enjoyed!The second part of this trip was to go for a camel ride. This....wasn't for me. We were all tethered in a row, and my husband's camel kept trying to gnaw on me! It wasn't terrible, and a did have some fun, but wouldn't do it again. And I was in the minority, as the rest of the party, including children, really enjoyed riding the camels. One warning though: Go to the toilet before you leave the hotel. The facilities are what you might expect of a Moroccan building in the middle of nowhere.All in all, a brilliant morning."

The ascent into the air was smooth and effortless. The view of the Atlas mountains was mesmerizing and to top it off, the pilot was hilarious, cracking jokes constantly throughout the 45mins we were in the air. We didn't stop laughing until our landing... in a cactus field.However, this was not the end. We were taken to have a feast of a breakfast/brunch in a traditional berber tent, and driven again to each have a solo camel ride in the Palmeraie before being taken back to our Riad.

Back on the four wheel drive it was back to the village for a lovely breakfast of fruit, eggs ,a variety of traditional breads, honey etc etc. A splendid feast. After this another interesting drive along small quiet roads through rustic villages and on to the Palmerie just outside Marrakech.

The guide was hysterical - cracking (good) jokes throughout, the Berber breakfast was delicious and the camel ride a lot of fun. I loved the whole experience and would recommend to anyone who visits Marrakech."

He made us feel completely comfortable, me and my partner were joined by another group of 4 so we had a group of 6 altogether. The breakfast was superb with plenty on offer. The balloon flight was a breathtaking experience, Even though it was over cast we still had stunning views. The camel ride wasn't to our taste but there wasn't anything wrong with it. All in all, it was expensive for the short time in the air (30-45 mins) but still a really good experience."

The balloon ride was great, with some great views of Marrakech and the surrounding area. The breakfast, coffee, and tea were tasty and plentiful. We enjoyed interacting with the camels also. We are not camel experts, but these animals seemed well treated to us.This event was a bit spendy, but honestly, it was one of the best things we did while in Morocco."

            "review": "Another bucket list item checked off.. What can you say. This was a balloon ride.We were picked up at 5:20am and driven for miles after picking up another four flyers. The journey was full of cheesy chat from the driver, but it passed the time. (Red lights do not count in Marrakesh before 6am, be warned).We arrived just as the balloon was being filled with air. A great site for the un-initiated.Once the basket was upright, we clamber in, (having been treated to tea and a croissant). 8 in the basket, (plus the pilot with lots more cheesy gags) mean there is not much room. The silence is broken only by the whoosh of the flames from the propane cylinders as you climb high above the barren land below. Views are great and i was delighted the pilot was clearly very proficient as take-off and landing were immaculate. Sadly, we were in the air for considerably less than the scheduled hour and no excuse as to why was given. (35 minutes only!!).Back to camp for a Berber breakfast. (The words ''Taliban village'' became a somewhat overused expression to describe the ramshackle buildings in which we were housed). Excellent home made cuisine however, consisting mainly of wheat and egg based product, but all delicious.As an aside, the bathroom facility, as you might expect, is a hole in the ground. Be warned.Back into the 4X4 to be taken to another part of the City for a camel ride. Poor camels, you have to feel sorry for them, but it was an experience not to be forgotten.Finally, back to base and the comfort of our hotel after almost 6 hours where only 35 minutes had actually been spent in the air!!But, had we been in the UK, you wonder how many times the trip would have been cancelled before you even got off the ground?Expensive few hours, but what can I say, another check against my bucket list"

We have ballooned before and one needs to remember that the distance covered is not as much as that say in Italy as there is little wind. But with little wind chances of a successful trip are high! Beautiful camp setup for food and beverages before and after a lovely ride over Morocco. Pilot and team were very professional. The additional camel ride is a glorified pony ride. I would just do the ballooning. The camels were attached and led in a circle with a guide. It was off a main road and as an animal lover, I can't agree with their conditions and care. Balloon ride experience is well worth it!!!"

Due to the wonderful energy and constant humor of both Moustafa and Hamid this was an unforgettable part of our trip in Marrakech.After being picked up we were woken up and entertained by our hosts.The trip itself was so smooth it was crazy, didnt realise we had taken off at first and Moustafa was keen to show off his skills, doing various 'tricks' with his balloon including landing it in the back of the truck.The breakfast was picturesque in a little village out in the countryside. So happy we did this, half the cost of doing it in England and three times the excitement with door to door service.The camel ride was a little bit short and needed the touch of Moustafa to inject some humor and information to the area we walked around. Seemed a little but like ticking a box but was still fun and a good part of the day.Really amazing experience I would suggest everyone to take part in."

Having flown balloons in 5 other countries, I jumped at the chance. The price was reasonable as it was to include a 45 min balloon ride, a village Moroccan breakfast and a camel ride, as well as transportation from and to the hotel. Unfortunately, our tour was well after the sunrise and did not go very far. It ended a bit short of 1/2 hr as the wind changed and the captain said he could not chance going too near the city. We never got very close to the Atlas Mountains. All that said, Marrakech By Air did go out of their way to make our disappointment less. They refunded $50 and gave us a very nice gift. Also, since we had already left the hotel and were on our way to another city, the driver with the money followed us for about a 100 miles to catch up and give it to us. I would call that great customer service. As other reviewers said, the captain was entertaining, though I think there should have been some safety instructions as I had on all my other balloon tours. Overall, the good surpassed the bad, though this balloon ride fell short of the others I took,"

The pilot Hamid what can I say that hasn't before . He is a character very funny and very skilled.

After the landing we were taken to a Berber house and served another breakfast this time a traditional Berber breakfast and mint tea. Then lastly a camel ride. The whole morning was just perfect."

The SUV was full & the ride got a bit bumpy. We drove about 30 minutes outside the city. We had some croissants & coffee in a Berber tent. There is a bathroom facility but it is a pit bathroom, so be prepared. Since it was the first ride of the day, we got to see the guys unload the ballon & fill it with hot air. We got up in the air in time to see the sun rise over the Atlas Mountains. Very peaceful & beautiful. After about 1-1.5 hours in the air, we came down. Another group switched places with us in the basket & then we drove back to the Berber tent where there was a HUGE breakfast spread with mint tea & about 10 different food options. After the second breakfast, we drove about 25 minutes to the Palmeraie to ride camels. After the camel ride, we got driven back to our riad. Guides were a lot of fun. Thank you guys!

The pick up was easy and the journey made entertaining. We had coffee and pastries before the flight. The balloon team are proficient and quickly had the balloon ready to go, we jumped in and had a great sunrise flight experience. Of course it was over too quickly. That is in the nature of such a great experience. We had a full breakfast after in the warmth of the tent which was very nice.After you are transported to La Palmeraie for the camel ride. This is not my favourite sort of activity but was also quite fun. It is good to have experienced it. The handlers were also proficient and knew what they were doing. It is a bonus to get the activity along with the balloon I think.Definitely a highlight of the trip to Marrakech, get it done here with Hameed if you want to have a great experience."

Can't rave enough about the staff- everyone was hilarious from the driver to the guide in the hot air balloon, they made me so at ease I totally forgot about my fear of heights. The view from the hot air balloon was amazing and the camel ride through the beautiful palmerie was totally surreal. My favourite part though was hanging out at the bottom of the Atlas Mountains with people who lived there: they made us a huge and delicious breakfast and were kind enough to offer us some of their own food (which was one of our favourite meals from the holiday). Playing football with a lil Berber boy there is a memory I'll treasure forever. Unbelievable experience altogether at excellent value. Thank you marrakech by air!! "

You have to leave very early in the morning but you get breakfast before and afterwards.

We were picked up at 6am from our riad and in fact we were late and they were waiting for us for about ten mins ! Hamid drove us about 20-25 mins out of the city to the outskirts for the take off. We were promptly given tea / coffee and some croissants early on. It was a experience seeing the crew blow up the balloon and get it ready. The ride itself lasted about 45-50 mins and was amazing. We took off just in time to see the sunrise and it was spectacular. Hamid was a great pilot and kept us entertained throughout the journey. Once you are up there we could hardly even feel any movement almost seemed like we were floating in air. Post the ride we were treated to some traditional Berber breakfast with a huge spread of bread, pancakes, fruits, cakes, juice and coffee. Post that we were taken to the palm areas for a quick camel ride and some pictures. Overall I think it was a wonderful experience and I would absolutely recommend it !"

I booked this excursion as the main activity for us to do whilst we had a short stay in this fascinating city and everything was amazing from start to finish.Ahmed phoned me the day before to arrange a pickup time which would be convenient. The following day we were greeted by Mustafa asking us 'are you ready for your bungee jump?' which shocked my wife as her faced dropped, this was just the start of the great sense of humour that Mustafa has! The whole journey from pickup to being dropped off he had this huge spirit of humour and friendliness which enhanced our experience of the balloon ride.One of our guests was slightly late so we missed being in the balloon as the sun rose but it was still breathtaking as we rose into the sky and looked back at the atlas mountains with a thin cloud below them made for a very ethereal feeling. Ahmed, the balloon pilot, was also just as funny as Mustafa and telling many jokes! We had a great time which lasted around 40 mins in the air.As we landed we were took to a berber village and the journey was just like before, full of jokes and fun. We got to the village and had some traditional breads which were all quite sweet and tasty.Onward to this we then travelled another hour to where the rich and famous like Angela Jolie & Brad Pitt to have a camel ride.This was an 'interesting' experience and by the end of the 30 min ride my back was a bit sore for the experience but an experience non the less. I think to experience riding camels in an authentic way you need to ride them in the sahara and actually live the life of the ddesert people for a while.When back in the car Mustafas favourite song was 'divi-diva-day' which he sung along to and brainwashed us all as I continue to hum it now and again lol.This experience was the best and I am very grateful to both Mustafa & Ahmed for giving us such an amazing experience. Book this now! You will not regret it! :)"

            "review": "Marrakech By Air - Go for the Balloon, Come Back for Moustafa. I could tell this was going to be a next-level tour from the get-go. As my wife and I were waiting for the 4x4 to pick us up in the medina, a strange man pulled his vehicle up beside us and asked us if we were going bungee jumping. Slightly confused, we responded, \"No, hot air ballooning.\". After asking us multiple times if we were sure (and afer he saw that I'd noticed another couple chuckling from the back seats), he finally relented and revealed his most prized secret - that he was indeed with Marrakech by Air and that he was our driver. It seemed that soon we would experience all that was Moustafa... we were not wrong. During the drive, we ravenously ate up punch line after punch line. I can't say I've ever laughed so hard at such an ungodly hour of the morning. Moustafa's demeanor certainly put us at ease (let's just say I'm not so hot with heights in general), which I personally appreciated quite a bit.Very shortly after leaving Marrakech proper, we arrived at a small outpost for a light snack before heading out to the launch site. On the way, Moustafa hit us with what could only be described as comedic gold. \"I am taking you to a Taliban camp.\", was my personal favourite (picture an over-zealous driver sticking his head out the window at an unprepared local yelling, \"HELLO, TALIBAN!!!\"). Gold.On arrival, we were equally excited about the balloon and bummed that the comedy show was ending.The conditions were a little windier than our newly-introduced pilot would have liked, so many of us taking the flight were required to take a bit of an accelerated entry into the basket while the crew worked feverishly to inflate and point the balloon skywards. I was apparently quite ignorant to the fact that there is indeed a lot that goes into getting one of these suckers upright, as every inch appeared to be a struggle. I particularily appreciated the entire crew hanging off the basket to keep it from steamrolling us unsuspecting passengers prior to launch. The crew appeared to be well organized and trained, which gave me that little bit more confidence that we would ascend and descend safely. Eventually (albeit with a little struggle) we all haphazardly managed to climb into the basket and experienced a bit of a rough take-off, which was notably causing our pilot some grief. Like a consummate professional, he took it in stride, and we seemingly rocketed upwards in a smooth, almost unnoticable way in merely a matter of seconds. And that was that - smooth, silent, calm sailing. I was certainly taken aback at the sudden calm.Once we had an opportunity to refocus on our surroundings, we soon realized that we were missing the incredible view. The sun had just crept over the misty snow-dusted Atlas mountains in the distance, affording us all amazing photos of the horizon and newly-lit landscape below. Other balloons could be seen off in the distance, giving a real sense of perspective and altitude.The flight itself was informative, thanks to the pilot. We all learned a number of things, including in no small part how amazingly expensive it is to own and operate a balloon. These types of tidbits only served to extend our already-growing appreciation of the experience.Our flight couldn't have lasted more than 20-30 minutes, however it provided ample opportunity for photos and videos.Our pilot smartly advised us on the landing procedure well before and during the landing as we were about to experience what I'd assume to be a near-worst case scenario.After searching for an appropriate place to land, we descended at a speed that I (in my near-nil balloning experience) thought to be acceptable, hit the ground with a decidedly jarring scrrrrrape before eventually settling flat on the ground. We had thought our ride was over, but the wind can be an especially vindictive foe given the right circumstances. We exited the balloon one by one as directed, however the basket was tilting more and more towards the ground with every second. \"Body weight on the basket, please!\", the pilot shouted - those of us able to run after the basket to assist him did so and jumped on with reckless abandon. Eventually, some of us ended up on top or scattered around the basket as it was eventually stopped... everyone laughing and panting and amazed that we puny humans took on the mighty wind and won.After we'd all had an opportunity for a few more laughs and photos with the balloon pilot and crew, we had a quick stop back at the outpost for a full breakfast and bathroom break before returning back to the Palmerie for an opportunity to ride the resident dromidaries and take photos.Overall, it was a great experience and one I hope all reading this has the opportunity to try for themselves. Marrakech by Air was great from start to finish and we'd highly recommend them."

We were given early advice on some potential weather changes and offered the option of an earlier flight which was great. The whole crew was fantastic and kept us relaxed and laughing. The flight itself was very smooth and the landing was very soft. The views were absolutely magnificent and looking at it in the peaceful quiet surroundings made it very special.Salam to Captain Hamid, Mustapha and rest of the crew we wish you continued success, this was the highlight of our holiday in Marrakech."

Hamid and mustaffa (sorry if spelt wrong) are just the 2 best hosts and are entertaining from the minute they pick you up. Seeing the sunrise over the Atlas Mountains on the morning of my 40th birthday is some thing I will never forget. The ride was so smooth and just magical scenery all finished off with a lovely Berber breakfast and a rather amusing camel ride, just book it you won't regret it"

First day got cancelled due to unfavourable weather conditions but thankfully we went the next day and then straight to the airport and they took us there which was great! The team of guys were great fun, lots of hilarity and so put everyone at their ease and I didn't even know that we'd taken off! The guys were especially good at helping me, seeing as I'd sprained my ankle that morning and so they lifted me in and out of the balloon and we had a beautifully soft landing at the end. All in all a great experience."

It was the first time for me and my friend to try this kind of attraction... everything was just perfect from the beginning. Wonderful Berber breakfast, a pleasant camel ride, 4x4 tour... obviously the flight was the most amazing experience... you can enjoy the beautiful view on the Atlas mountains, feel the wind in your hair and admire the rising sun.... great opportunity to remind to yourself how beautiful the world is. The best thing about this attraction are the people who organise it, they are amazing... we were joking non stop during the whole trip... they definitely represent the warm and hospitable nature of Moroccan society. You can't miss this trip while being in Marrakech! Perfect experience for all those who love to feel the freedom..."

It was quite simply a fabulous fun filled morning. I am scared of heights and to say that I was frightened was an understatement. In fact I very nearly didn't get into the basket. However, Hamid (the balloon pilot) had me and the seven of my friends laughing so much that before I knew it I was in the basket and somehow a mile up in the air. A breathtaking experience both in terms of views and of how much we laughed!! From pick up, through breakfast (before and after the flight), the flight, camel ride and to the drop off, Hamid and his team could not have done more for us. A wonderful experience, worth every penny (or dhs!!)."

Unfortunately for us, we didn't make the sunrise flight (not sure if it's because we booked late) however we still had a great time. We were picked up promptly at our hotel and after another pick up whisked off to the balloon site. Our driver (sorry can't remember his name) was hilarious, his one liners reminded me of Del Boy from Only Fools & Horses!!. When we arrived we had tea and croissants and then we were introduced to the balloon pilot (again didn't catch his name) however I didn't think it was possible to find anyone funnier than the driver but again he was hilarious. Don't want to give too much away but they had a fantastic way with the customers and carried out some funny pranks!! The berber breakfast was a feast, there was more than enough to feed an army. Finally, we went onto the camel ride (around 15 mins) but to be fair I could have easily skipped that. The price for this trip on face value seems a bit expensive but the staff put their heart and soul into making sure you have a fantastic time making some great memories along the way of which you can't put a price on!!"

Aside from laughing until my sides ached the entire time, the whole trip was wonderfully organised and such a special place to be. The serenity of floating above the mountains was unlike anything I have experienced and it was breathtakingly beautiful to see the Atlas below and in such peace. The sunrise was spectacular, it was such a shame it had to end. The journey out to the desert was quick and comfortable and our driver/pilot, Hamid, was fantastically comical, he had everyone in stitches the whole time, both before and during the flight. The breakfast they served was delicious and the camels were not as uncomfortable as expected! Everyone was very warm and welcoming and I would definitely recommend adding this to your itinerary; it's certainly something I won't be forgetting."

We were very lucky in being the first flight of the season and the pilot/driver and the staff were amazing. We were collected from our Riad in the early hours of the morning and driven about 40 minutes outside Marrakech to a berber house where they had a gorgeous breakfast spread ready for us. Once we were finished we took another journey 5 minutes away to a dried up river bed, where we would take off that morning. It was fascinating watching them blow the balloon up. It was such a joy to be in as I thought it would be a quick take off like on a fair ground ride but no it was so slow and calm and relaxed that even if you were afraid of heights you wouldn't notice. Watching the sunrise over the Atlas Mountains was truly beautiful and to do it in a hot air balloon was even more memorable. After the journey we went back to the berber tent and were presented with more delicious food before heading back towards Marrakech. On the way we stopped for a camel ride, which lasted about 15 minutes, but honestly you wouldn't want to be on it any longer as it would be very boring and really all you may want it the photo op. Would highly recommend this company to fly with."

Hamid picked us up in his Land Rover Defender and made short work out of the road into the dessert for the early morning launch. I'm still rocking out to the souvenir CD he gave us en route. He is a great pilot and we felt safe all along. I only wish we had opted out of the camel ride as some others did. Seeing the camels chained along the side of the road really brought us down at the end of a otherwise wonderful morning. Perhaps a worthwhile add-on for the British all-inclusive set, but sophisticated travelers are better off skipping it. Five stars otherwise."

As they do two trips, we were lucky to go second and did the balloon chase first, which was good fun cruising along trying to keep up with the balloon. once it was our turn, Hamid our Pilot was fantastic. He pointed out many beautiful things that you normally wouldn't see from the ground. The landing was rather entertaining as the wind changed just before we touched down. It was amazing how soft and technical it was, but Hamid was an absolute professional at it. At the end we helped pack up the balloon, I was surprised at how quick it was to pack up and how big it is when it is lying on the ground.Great fun.Thank you"

Hamid was hilarious (though if you are initially afraid, he will certainly play on those fears with some unrelenting, yet innocent teasing). I felt in very capable hands and the sunrise was beautiful. Afterwards, we were driven back to where we started and had breakfast. Breakfast was just that, a Moroccan breakfast: multiple types of bread, jam, honey, and fruit.This is where the trip began it's downward trajectory. Here we are, in the countryside anticipating a camel ride, when we are ushered back in the land rover and taken back to civilization. Cue furrowed brow. We drive into an area called the Palmeraie, which if you look it up is where anyone who is anybody lives - the wealth of Morocco in all it's splendor. Nestled in between gated mansions we pull in to an empty lot filled with sad looking camels tied to their spots. Once we were all assisted onto these pity-evoking animals, a man led us around (did I mention he was walking and leaded with a rope, or what I might call a leash) for about 15 minutes. Now to be fair, if you simply want to say that you rode a camel then this may be perfect for you; however, if you want an even remotely authentic experience, this will make you cringe."

We waited in the hotel lobby for our transportation for 35min at 5:10am and no one arrived. We then went back to our room and received a phone call from the lobby stating our transportation was there. We spoke over the phone to the owner, he was very apologetic that a couple at the previous hotel had been late and this caused the tardiness. We decided to continue with the trip and had an amazing time. We were driven northeast of the city to a small village where tea and rolls were waiting for us. We watched them fill the ballon and his team was very efficient. The balloon ride was about 45 min and very enjoyable. We had a clear day so we were able to go up as high as the limit. You do not travel very far maybe 30km or so and the landing was very smooth on the the trailer of the awaiting truck. Then returned to the original village for a traditional breakfast which was very good. Then traveled back to the palmeria area for the camel ride. This part of the trip was so so. We have never ridden a camel before so that was fun. We did feel quite bad for the camels though as they looked a little malnourished and were tied down by there leg to one spot. The guide tied all the camels together and we were led along a trail for about 20 min. The guide stopped to take pictures for us during the journey. We were then returned to our hotel without any problems. All in all it was a fun experience we really did not see the owner much, initially when he picked us up and during the ballon ride, he then left after the ballon ride was done and we never saw him again."

My husband and I went on a balloon ride for our honeymoon and were very excited about it, as we booked it months before we arrived in Marrakech, We woke up late the morning of our balloon ride and were afraid that we would miss the balloon ride. However, Mustafa drove back to our riad to collect us and assured us that the balloon ride would still occur, and it did.Before the ride, we were treated to a nice Berber breakfast while Mustafa and his team assembled and inflated the balloon. Then, we were escorted into the balloon and up in the sky. The ride was so smooth and tranquil. You don't even feel the take off or the landing. Everything was very peaceful. We even watched the sun rise and were bale to take pictures and videos of the balloon ride. During the ride, Mustafa put everyone with fears at ease and has a great sense of humor. There is no reason to be afraid at all. Once we landed, we had a nice little award ceremony where everyone who flew received certificates of completion. Mustafa even wrote our names in Arabic when we asked him to.After the ride we had a Berber feast for breakfast with crepes, fresh fruits, breads, marmalades and jams, and eggs, among other foods. During this time, we engaged in some friendly conversation with our fellow balloon riders and had the opportunity to relax and then talk about what an amazing experience we had in the balloon. We were then escorted back to 4x4 and taken to ride the camels. The camels were a little temperamental, but the guide calmed them down. The ride lasted about 10-15 minutes and was a good experience. Overall, the entire experience was a good one and I would highly recommend booking the balloon ride and complimentary camel ride as soon as possible if you're going to be in Marrakech. You will not be disappointed and will have a great time."

The day we were meant to go it was raining so was cancelled however Hamid booked us in for another day. I was so apprehensive but he collected us at 6.20 am and straight away his sense of humour put me at ease. Watched the balloon inflate - for me the hardest part was actually getting in and out of the basket. We took off and as other reviewers have said you don't even realise it and it is so tranquil, spot on landing then off for breakfast. Then the camel ride where I hung on for dear life but another thing experienced and Hamid is absolutely the best host. Even if you are afraid of heights this is a must do in Marrakech. So to Hamid and his team thank you so much for a wonderful morning."

Mustafa and Hamid plus all of the team provided a great experience with a lot of fun and humour thrown in. Wasn't the least bit scary and once you're up in the air (you don't even realise you've left the ground it's that smooth) the calm and quiet is quite surreal and hard to compare to anything else. The extras provided like the lovely breakfasts (2, yes 2! One before and a feast afterwards) by the Berber family and then the finale, free camel ride just added to the experience. Don't hesitate to book it - you will not regret it."

We watched the balloon inflate whilst we had delicious croissant's & coffee and then up, up and away. You literally drift off before you realise they've released you. Hamid our pilot was extremely funny and made us all feel at ease whilst being an excellent pilot & landing our balloon on the trailer! (With the help of his ground crew!). The camel ride was a lot of fun too with the two month old baby camels following us. Would I do it again? Most definitely! Thanks very much to Pam & Donald for our 30th Wedding Anniversary present!"

Lots of care taken to ensure you enjoy the trip and get all the pictures you want. Breakfast is HUGE! bring an empty stomach. Camel ride is cheesy and you walk about 10mins on the camels before being ushered on the car and driven back. Recommend if you haven't been on a balloon ride."

Never having flown by hot air balloon before we really didn\u2019t know what to expect. And with an early morning start of 6.00am the kids were not really excited.Well that all changed when we met the crew, Mustafa and Hamid. Especially Hamid who quickly shook off any traces of sleep or tiredness in us all with his energy, enthusiasm and quick humour. Before we knew it we were wide awake and ready to go.The takeoff was really smooth and soon we were high up in the sky. Watching the sun rising over the mountains was amazing. And our balloon was the only one that made it up in the air before the sunrise. We saw 2 other balloons still trying to get into the air whilst we were enjoying the sunrise.After the traditional berber breakfast topped of with juicy watermelon we headed off for the camel ride. The great thing about this was that the kids were allowed to ride on their own camel and loved it, as well as meeting the baby camels.All we can say is if you come to Marrakech then definitely do the Balloon trip with Marrakech by Air as Hamid/Mustafa make it a memorable experience that you will never forget."

Mustafa picked us up from our riad and immediately set the tone for the day by joking with us. We enjoyed tea and croissants while watching the balloon being prepared, then had a fabulous ride in the balloon. After this we had a large traditional Berber breakfast (lots of different types of bread), before driving to the Palmerie to ride camels. Make sure you bring a jacket with you, as although it was 35 degrees during the day, at that time of the morning and in the air it's quite cold. Also, bathroom facilities are a hole in the ground at the Berber house! Mustafa and Hamid really make the whole experience laughing and joking all the way and we would definitely recommend this tour, it's well worth the money."

Hamid our pilot also had three children so knew how to look after ours brilliantly, they loved the whole experience. Hamid picked us up from the door of our villa, and drove us out to the launch site. There we had croissants and coffee and because hamid had noticed my cough I had hot milk with honey. We joined 4 other people for the balloon flight that was absolutely wonderful. When Hamid joked he was going to land the balloon on the trailer we all laughed as hamid spent the day making us all laugh. However, he's a brilliant pilot and was as good as his word. This is the third balloon trip my husband and I have done - the others in the UK and India and this was the best landing by far. Afterwards we had an amazing breakfast back at the tent before heading off for the camel ride. This was a 15 minute walk round but with baby camels to watch our kids were in heaven again. We all had our own camel to ride but the guides were happy to let the kids ride with us as well. The others on the trip commented that for the price, this trip represents the best value in Marrakech. With a lift back to our villa again from the hard working and very friendly Hamid, we couldn't fault it."

Everything was freshly baked by the lady who lives in the Berber house. We ended our excursion with a camel ride in la Palmerai, a beautiful place where they grow palm trees. We didn't have to worry about how to get there or how to return to our hotel because that was well taken care of by the crew of our captain Hamid.

A group of us booked Marrakech by Air and we stubbled out of bed early to enjoy the experience bleary-eyed and tired from a lovely diner the night previously.We were picked up by 2 4x4's who rapidly shuttled us out into the dessert, the landscape getting more arid and dry and bleak, after playing chicken with the odd truck and donkey on the road we veered off the road to cross farm land and little used roads. We'd now lost sight of all civilization and had resolutely decided we were the next people to appear on the internet being beheaded. Our pilot/company owner/comedian/lunatic actively encourages this his repertoire is in fact hilarious. We stopped next to a tent in the dark in the middle of nowhere where a huge breakfast spread was awaiting us. It was cold but very cosy (this was mid feb) there were boiled eggs, breads, teas, fruit etc a great start.After breakfast the sun was just struggling to make a solid appearance (like us it should be noted) but now full and sated we got back in the 4x4's and set off for the launch site ( the most open space upwind ). Sadly the wind was far too strong on this day and after 40 minutes hoping it would die down our Pilot cancelled the flight. (His first signs of seriousness but we were very glad safety came first ). We then set off for the last part of the adventure and went to the camels for a ride. This is clearly the secondary part and a little too like a donkey ride in a sea-side resort a quick loop of the block and your done! However thats not what we were there for.We were only there for 3 days so we asked if we could do the ballon part the following day, which they agreed at no charge. We asked if we could skip the other activities and be picked up a little later. So we set off at 8am this time (much more civilized) however we did have to rush directly to the launch site. The weather was clear and little wind and we had arranged the ballon to be inflated prior to our arrival so we could set straight off. We disembarked from the 4x4's ( yes they picked us up from our Riyad again and got straight in the ballon basket.We rapidly launched and drifted serenely over the varied landscape. The snow caped peaks of the Atlas mountains and Marrakech waking up in the distance. Throughout our pilot was humorous and informative, the warmth of the burners keeping us snug.We headed in towards the city and so had to land and this is the true testament of our pilot, he landed the ballon on the trailer attached to the 4x4, his crew there to help ensure the landing was gentle and safe.These guys are real pros it is a slick and safe operation and well worth it, no its better than that its an absolute MUST!ps I ticked the box bathroom facilities as there was a functioning toilet at the breakfast, its basic you may wish to take your own paper. If your in the Ballon well be discrete!"

Mustapha picked us up early in the morning and drove us to the desert. He is a funny driver and took good care of us during the full morning. The ballon trip is exceptional with lovely view over the atlas moutains as the sun is ricing. It is so peacefull and mindblowing to be in a balloon and even its a bit pricy around 2000 DH per person its worth it. It also includes a nice breakfast at a local berber farmhouse and and half hour camel trip near the palmerias in Marrakech. You will be back in your riad before noon, so you still have a good long day ahead of you. If you ever want to try a baloon I cannot think of a better place."

He was both engaging and entertaining. We had a quick pastry in a Berber tent while the balloon was prepared. The ride itself was wonderful although it was a bit cloudy. We wish we could have stayed in the air for a longer time. After the balloon we went back to the tent for a breakfast prepared by a Berber woman and a quick tour of the home during which we got to hold the tiniest little goat kids. The only part that doesn't add to the tour was the camel ride. It is in the palmerie which sounds fantastic but its got trash everywhere and the camels are all tethered together. You are basically led in a circle for about 10 minutes. We had done a camel ride in Egypt and it was fantastic. Even the people who had not been on camels before were talking about how disappointed they were. Really that whole piece of the tour could be taken out. Overall we really enjoyed the tour and would recommend it."

I have wished to fly with the balloon and because we were celebrating two years of our marriage the 31st of December I wanted to prepare a nice surprise for my husband. But given the day, I thought there might not be lots of places open or too many things to do. How happy I was when I got the response to my mail and the team from \"Marrakesh by air\" confirmed that they can book us a flight with the balloon on the 31st early in the morning! :) Everything was great especially that our balloon was the first to lift up and we could see the sunrise just from the beginning. And we could also see the other two balloons lifting up and we took superb photos! I recommend this experience to everyone. it is really something else and it is worth it! just a heads up - if you are doing this in winter time remember to dress up very very well. We were not prepared for the cold at 6 in the morning and we caught an ugly cold. The experience takes about 5 hours as you are taken in a berber village in an open space so that they can inflate the balloon. Then the balloon experience takes about 1 hour and up there is not that cold because the sun starts warming you up. Once you are finished with that, there is the berber breakfast. The only thing warming us was the tea; otherwise it was very very cold. Then you are taken in a special arranged place for a ride with the dromader. This was very fun and we loved it. All in all this was a super experience and we recommend \"Marrakech by air\" team as they are very professional and made this a super experience for us. Thanks guys!"

It's not cheap, but if you can afford it then it is a fantastic experience and will leave you with many happy memories!The pilot and his colleague are superb, full of jokes and plenty of knowledge - in fact we wished they had been our guides for other day trips we took while in Marrakech.In brief, early morning collection in modern 4x4s, driving through the desert before dawn, light pre-flight meal, 45' or so in the balloon including a stunning sunrise, and while other balloons in the distance just went up and stayed there the pilot for this company took us up/down/around, explaining how he controlled the balloon and displayed expert handling! We then had a larger breakfast, a tour of the Berber house, then back in the Jeeps...a camel (dromedary camel) ride, then home.Superb and the highlight of our trip...do it!"

From the pick up from our hotel to our return we were treated to a reassuring sense of humour and lots of fun. We travelled as a family of four adults and were joined by another couple. It was relaxing taking coffee and croissants before our flight in the Berber tent. We watched the preparation of the balloon and then take off! Our pilot Hamid filled us with confidence which was necessary as all 6 passengers were newbies! We felt in very safe hands. It wasn't a far journey in terms of distance travelled horizontal to the earth but a great flight. The Berber breakfast was simply delicious and unhurried. We messed around wearing the hats and had some fun chatting to the local people in mixed Arabic French and mime! The camel ride in the palmery was a lovely relaxing end."

This driver cum Africa-style-DJ really started our day with a bang - how does he do it? After a pre-flight snack we could follow the preparation of the balloon first hand without excessive restrictions. The pilot Hamid was another great character, very approachable and even took the time to explain the special fabrics which make the balloon rugged enough for the job. The flight itself was amazing with captain Hamid switching back and forth between his extremely skilled handling of the airship and a never-ending cocktail of humour. The views from that height were spectacular - the closest thing to a bird in flight - and it all felt very safe. Hamid performed some amazing stunts during the trip which rate him among the best. After landing we were treated to a generous breakfast and finally taken to the palmery for a camel ride before being driven back to our doorstep. Totally unforgettable fun. Highly recommended!"

            "review": "The highlight of our time in Marrakech. My partner and I booked this balloon flight when we had a few days spare in Marrakech and weren't sure how to fill them. We received a prompt reply by email and arranged to meet at a spot near our riad. Word of warning: these guys are non-stop jokers. At 5 in the morning they are full of energy and pranks will ensue from the minute they pick you up to the minute they drop you off. This won't be for everyone (having the car door I was leaning on be yanked open during transit to be screamed at by one of the other pilots at 5:30 in the morning was pretty nerve racking to say the least) but it doesn't stop this from being one of the best experiences you can have in Marrakech. We were given a filling breakfast of croissants and coffee whilst the balloon was blown up in front of us, and then we were off! The view was incredible, and the takeoff so gentle we hardly knew we were off the ground. Despite all the jokes, the pilot was extremely capable and I didn't feel unsafe at any time. The flight lasted just the right amount of time - about an hour - and we got see the sun come up over the Atlas mountains, which was too incredible for words. Afterwards we were treated to a traditional Moroccan breakfast (lots of carbs!) with sweet mint tea and a tour of the nearby Berber village, which was very interesting. We then got to ride Camels in tandem, which wasn't the most exciting experience as it wasn't a free range ride but was still fun. All in all, it was a great day and something well worth doing. Most people will probably enjoy the constant joking of the pilots and company but if you're a bit more reserved like me, you may find it wearing and a bit much too take that early in the morning. Still, it was a fantastic experience and well worth the money, I'd highly recommend it."

Having arrived in country the night before we certainly had no idea what to expect when Hamid arrived promptly at our hotel to get our experience started. He was full of energy and always ready with a smile and a joke as we headed out to the launch site in the early morning darkness. Hamid did a wonderful job keeping the mood light as the balloon was readied and all of the of ground crew was extremely professional. Prior to launching we were offered some tea and some pastries as we watched the balloon being inflated. Once airborne, Hamid was an outstanding pilot who was ready to answer any questions we had while he made everyone feel completely at ease. The sun coming up over the mountains was breathtaking and it was an experience we will never forget. After the flight we were offered breakfast and a tour of a Berber house before heading back towards the city with Mustafa and the opportunity to ride a camel. Mustafa was also quite humorous and was a very good host who told us about local customs and anything else we could think to ask. The camel riding experience was fun and while not a 'free range' sort of experience, coupled with the balloon ride it was well worth the time. The camel ride was a pretty organized event with the group of us being strung into a line and being led around a large area filled with a lot of palm trees which worked fine for picture taking but may not lend itself as much to the feeling of really riding a camel out in the desert. Overall, I would really recommend the trip as it is professionally done and there was never a feeling of being anything less than safe."

I have just returned to my hotel after spending 5 hours with Hamid, Mustafa and their crew, watching the sun rise over the Atlas mountains, having breakfast at a berber village and riding camels just outside Marrakech. What an experience! I cannot speak highly enough about their professionalism and hospitality. I have booked this tour on-line, Hamid confirmed the pick-up time over the phone and there we went out to the desert. We have been offered tea and coffee while we were waiting for the balloon to be set up. After taking off we enjoyed a beautiful float in the air 1000 metres above the ground. We were invited for breakfast and they showed us around the berber house. Mustafa drove us to the outskirts of Marrakech where we rode camels. Despite the early start in the day the whole trip was enjoyable and FUN as the guys kept all of us in a very good mood. There were loads of laughter, jokes, music and photos. It was worth every single penny. Don't miss out on this experience when you are visiting Marrakech!!!"

Folks, it was mind boggling and fantastic ride which was organised by Capt.Hamid, very professional where the captain proved him self by landing the hot air baloon base at the trailer which is 2 x 4 Mtr (wow). I bet, no one in this world will dare to do such a safe and highly professional landing. And the whole flight was filled with full of funny jokes and mouthful of laughs by Capt.Hamid. and very reasonable rates which includes pick up and drop to the hotel by 4 x 4 car ,delicious berber breakfast along with berber hospitality in the middle of sahara (wow) and d courageous camel ride approximately one hour where you can experience the beautiful site seeings. My conclutions, just go for it and say thanks to me for my motivation for takeing such baloon ride. Ciaaoo. By Mohammed Gulshan from India / UAE."

Our pilot was absolutely hysterical from the minute he picked us up in the early morning from our riads to the minute he landed us on the ground again. I really enjoyed my time with him and Mustafa, another person on the staff, as much as the actual balloon ride. Being able to see the sunrise was gorgeous and breathtaking and we had a very enjoyable flight. Afterwards we had a very nice breakfast at a Berber house and got a little tour of the surroundings. From there was a trip to ride camels, which was kind of short and unexciting after the balloon ride, but an added plus as most other companies didn't offer this yet still cost the same price. I would highly recommend using Marrakech by Air if you are planning a balloon ride while in Morocco."

We were picked up quite early outside our hotel and taken on quite a hairey but amusing drive to the starting point where we were given delicious croissants while we watched the balloon being prepared. Then into the basket for an amazing journey through the air followed by a perfect landing. We all went back to the tent then for a full Moroccan breakfast before setting off to find our camels for a ride through the Palmeries. An experience we will never forget."

We had an early start into the day and were picked up from our hotel as it was still dark. On the way to the Berber village we were joined by a second car. Our group would consist of eight people and the pilot. The pilot introduced himself by getting out of the car whilst it was driving and running next to ours. I'm not sure how the group in his car felt about that but it made me laugh. After a short drive we arrived in a Berber village where we received a small breakfast whilst the air balloon was set up. I have nor words describing the air balloon ride. Yes, we were extremely high up in the air. Yes, it was tight in the basket. Yes, my head was sometimes hot because of the fire above me. Did I care in this moment? NO. The view was breathtaking. There was such a calmness about it. I could endlessly look around and enjoy the atmosphere. Witnessing the sunrise in front of the Atlas mountains was phenomenal. And in this moment nothing really mattered. Not even the jokes of the pilot that we might crash. I decided that he was allowed to make this kind of jokes as he was doing such a fantastic job in flying the balloon. He clearly knew what he was doing and this relaxed everyone.The pilot was landing on the back of his van with an unbelievable accuracy. We all received a certificate before returning to the Berber village where we received a second breakfast. It included all kind of traditional Moroccan bread. The second part of the excursion was a camel ride. Back in the car we were brought to a different place. I was looking forward to riding a camel as I have never done something similar. Personally I was a bit disappointed. The camels were waiting for us next to a street. They did not particularly look well kept and it was not the most picturesque area of Marrakech I could imagine. It was an experience, nothing to recommend. To be honest we booked the air ballon ride and this was only and extra.This day was unforgettable for me and my brother and we really enjoyed it. Thank you."

We were picked up super early as planned and as we weaved through Marrakech picking up the other two couples we were entertained with jokes and stories by our funny driver. An hour or so later we were at the launch site and welcomed with drinks and pastries to set us up for our balloon flight. Whilst we were eating the balloon was prepped and inflated in front of us. In no time at all it was inflated and we were floating up into the sky.The flight itself was amazing. It took about an hour and the sunrise and the views of the Atlas mountains were spectacular!Once landed and collected we were taken back to the Berber village where we breakfasted properly and were given a tour of the Berber dwelling and way of life.We then headed off for our camel ride and although I was a little nervous about the standing up and sitting down bit it was actually a great ride once you relaxed into it!All in all a fantastic trip and well worth the money.

The pilot was hilarious all the time and everyone had a blast laughing. After the 2nd ride was ready, we were given a big breakfast and afterwards we went for a camel ride.Once it was over, we were taken back to Jemaa el Fna.Surely it is an experience worth doing while visiting Marrakesh!!"

Hamid is a really smiley jokey man but you could instantly tell that he's a master pilot. He explained how he can turn the balloon by different ropes. He gently took the balloon down and then rose it again effortlessly - such control. We went over a Berber village which was fascinating to get such a grew close birds eye view. We then were taken back to the tent for breakfast - a feast of melon and different breads and mint tea. We then had a bulky drive to where you have your camel rides. They tied the 6 camels together and then lead us on a walk, again a nice jovial man who took photos for everyone. Then Mohammed came back and gave us all a cd of the music he'd been playing in the car. What a nice touch - yes expensive but it was worth it."

This was a surprise for my partners birthday and the company dealt with everything with a professional and friendly manner. From the emails from the office, the driver, pilot and ground crew everybody was brilliant. The pickup arrived on time and delivered us safely and smoothly. The driver was friendly and added a distinctly Moroccan sense of humour to the trip to the Berber village that was our takeoff point. The pilot was excellent, professional and put all of us immediately at ease. We were greeted with a snack (it's before breakfast after all!!) as the balloon was inflated. Then a quick safety brief before you rise to the heights. A fantastic sunrise awaits on this memorable trip. The fight is around an hour or so and is great - an American fellow passenger even proposed to his girlfriend as the sun broke above the Atlas mountains! On landing a traditional breakfast awaits then its back in the pick-up truck for a short journey to the camel ride which lasts about 30mins. Then its back to your hotel. Overall a very well organised excursion with an early start crucial to witness the beautiful sunrise. We were looked after from start to finish and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Well done Air Morocco. Highly recommended."

In fact our trip was brought forward by a day as Hamid rang our riad to say that the forecast was better for that day. We were collected at 5am and driven out of Marrakesh, others have commented on the 'adventurous' driving and at 5am that was certainly the case (although not when coming back as the roads were busier) however I'd taken note that the 4x4 was in pristine condition so he must know what he was doing!Lots of joking and messing around which was a lot of fun however don't mistake this for lack of professionalism, when it came to getting into the basket/take off Hamid was very serious and in control. Lovely coffee and pastries on arrival (whilst we were waiting) and a fantastic breakfast awaited us on landing. There is a toilet you can use before going onto the camel ride but be aware of cultural differences.....The balloon fight was amazing, so quiet and still, so serene. I felt very safe and loved every moment of it. Of course we took fantastic photos and video clips too.The camel ride wasn't my highlight. I'm very glad that I have tried it but it wasn't very comfortable and the land we were led over was a bit scruffy and litter strewn. I must add though that the man leading us was excellent at stopping and taking lots of photos of us using our cameras.Overall I would say for us it was well worth the money and I loved it."

After the ride, which looks over authentic Berber villages, we received a tour of a Berber home. Then another entertaining ride by Mustafa back to Marrakech, along the way a stop to ride camels. Again, we'd recommend to anyone."

We were collected promptly at the agreed time by Mustapha who set the tone for the trip perfectly with lots of fun and humour even at 6am. Once at the take off area, hot drinks and pastries were available in a Berber tent followed by introductions to our pilot Hamid. It was great to be involved in getting ready for take off and the actual lift off was so smooth we didn't know we were off the ground. The views were breathtaking and Hamid was great fun as well as being very informative describing the Berber villages way of life. After a smooth landing were taken back to our tent for lunch served by local Berber women, again very tasty, and then a tour of their property which was interesting. It was then on to the camel ride which was fun, before returning to our pick up point. At all times safety was paramount and the attention to detail was very professional. Our hot air balloon ride was the highlight of our holiday, it was great value and worth every Dirham! We would thoroughly recommend this trip to everyone."

Neither myself or my husband had been in a hot air balloon before so the trip with Marrakesh by Air was a big treat for both of us. It was a great morning, a lovely flight on the balloon, a breakfast at a berber house and a hilarious camel ride to top it off. Highlights were of course the fantastic views from the balloon but also the great attitude of the Marrakesh by Air staff who all seem to genuinely enjoy their work and were friendly and helpful. Nice to see people providing a great service and not just making money out of tourists. Might see you on a Belgian flight one day Hamid!"

African music to accompany the cross country drive to the launch site where we had coffee and croissant while the crew inflated the balloon and then a \"cosy\" flight to watch the sun rise over the high Atlas mountains. A touch and go before coasting over the Berber villages. Hamid rose to the challenge to land the basket on the trailer of the support truck with a little help from the ground crew which negated the crush of 4 hips trying to crouch down for the landing. At 62 I did not rise to Hamid's challenge to jump out of the land rover and run alongside! Breakfast back at the Berber village was memorable and then to finish with a camel ride through the gardens completed a true Moroccan experience. Several ticks off the bucket list! Couldn't believe it was only 10am when we were back at the hotel. Thanks for a great morning Hamid, Highly recommended."

The staff are very energetic (really energetic for the this time of the morning) but professional and appear to run a safe and competent operation. The ballooning happens just outside the city, due to the airspace restrictions they cannot fly over the city. Breakfast provided is a good standard for Morocco. The camel ride at the end we could have done without (mostly due to another wonderful outing the day before and the animals look slightly rough). Overall though this is a worthwhile expense that adds to your time in Marrakech."

At no point during the flight did we ever feel unsafe and I would thoroughly recommend not paying too much attention to recent news and get up up and away in a beautiful balloon. Spot on Marrakech by Scare (Mustafa's joke, not mine). Keep up the good work for the balloon industry."

Before departing I scanned the web to get some suitable ideas on what type of trips were available to us in the area. I came across Marrakech By Air and was impressed by the consistent high ratings this trip recieved. I contacted MBA vis email, asking for more details, times, days that were available etc etc. The response was always quick and helpfull. I booked the trip prior to our departure to Morrocco. The final email advising me to contact the Captain by telephone the day before and booked flight to confirm pick up times. On the day of our trip we were collected from our hotel in a very comfortable land cruiser type vehicle and were taken to a Berber dwelling where coffee and cakes were waiting. The Captain along with his ground crew set about inflateing the balloon. Once ready off we went. It was amazing!! So tranquil. Jokes and humour abound from all quarters, but at no time did we feel uneasy or worried for our safety. The Captain was in constant communication with his ground crew who were there on landing and they then conveyed us back to the Berber dwelling where a traditional breakfast was waiting for us. Oh and as a by the way, on the way back to our hotel we stopped for a camel ride, also included in the trip. This also great fun! You cannot visit Morrocco and not ride a camel. I cannot speak highly enough of this experience, especially with the recent tragic event in Egypt. If you can go on this trip, want to go on this trip...............do it! You will not be dissapointed."

Apparently a few groups had cancelled, but they really missed out on a great time. The day was cloudy so we ended up floating through white fluffy clouds. The silence was something else. Only birds calling could be heard as we drifted through white. We came down shortly afterwards near a Berber village and then drive a few KM to a house for breakfast and then on to a 3km camel ride through one of the suburbs of Marrakesh.Don't be put off by the sad news from Cairo. It's not without risk but so is driving a car. We felt perfectly safe with Hamid piloting the balloon."

They picked us up at 6 am from our hotel and we had a sunrise balloon ride. The first to book get the sunrise ride (they do two trips a day back to back), so it is best to book early if you can. It was very interesting to see a Berber town by air. We are a family of four with two teenage girls (15 and 13), they loved the day. After the ballon ride we had a traditional Berber breakfast in a Berber home with gracious hosts. The camel ride was also great. It wasn't terribly long, but gave you a good feel for riding a camel. They let us feed the camels and spend as much time as we wanted with the camels before we departed. We were never rushed. I would highly recommend this company."

Every person we had contact with was friendly, respectful and FUN! Our driver and pilot were so warm and funny. The ride out to the launch gave us a view of Berber life outside of the city. We had a lively group - laughing and talking as we ascended, but as we floated above the villages, we settled into a peaceful silence. Hamid, our comedic pilot, allowed us to enjoy the experience without comment. The Berber breakfast after the ride was lovely - the food was great as was our hostess and the company. The camel ride lasted longer than I expected and it would have been find with me if it had been shorter. Still, I'm glad I had the experience (and photos to prove it!). All in all, a great time, but here is the MOST IMPORTANT aspect of this trip. I took my ring off to wash my hands before breakfast and left it in my pocket. When we got back to our riad, I realized the ring was gone. I called the booking office and the scheduler said they would look for it. I had no expectation that I would ever see that ring again. Later that day I got a call saying they found it at the breakfast tent!!! She said they would pick it up the next morning and deliver to me. Hamid brought it to us and refused to accept a reward. Their integrity and kindness was even more valuable than anything else I experienced. Thank you Marrakech by Air!"

It was truly worth every single dime!!I was very worried because I was going alone but Hamid, the pilot and his crew quickly turned it into the best experience I've ever had on a trip. I was picked up at exactly the time I was told. On the way to the berber village, Hamid shared many exhilarating stories of his own travels with me and the couple that we picked up on the way. The Breakfast was authentic and the rest of the tourists were interesting and amiable characters. We were told numerous humorous jokes once in the air. The landing was rough!! However, I thought it was the highlight of the flight because it was so very exiting. We were then driven to the palmerie to meet the oh-so-awaited camels. The drive to the palmerie was exellent!! you must see how the pilot drives his land rover!!I was scared out of my wits by both the camels, Hamid and Mustafa, a member of the crew. I was under a solid impression that camels were servile and docile animals. They are not!! I screamed and jumped away when I saw that fiend's gargantuan teeth. It took my entire reserve of courage and an internal pep talk to approach one and take a picture. Mustafa and Hamid, amused by my reaction, took turns scaring me from behind. I proceeded to jump, jerk and panic since I assumed that the camels had gotten hold of me. It was so much fun!!Once you actually get on the camels, you realize that they are not all that bad. I STRONGLY URGE you to try this experience for yourself!!"

This was the first hot-air balloon excursion I have done, and although you could do this in most countries, Marrakech by Air made this one an exciting cultural excursion as well as an amazing hour in the hot-air balloon. We were picked up at 6am at an agreed meeting place, not far from our hotel, and driven into the beautiful countryside, at the foothills of the Atlas mountains. After a 20 minute stop at a Berber (mountain people) village for pan-au-chocolate and mint tea, we were off again to find a clear spot to start our balloon ride. Once we had a suitable area, out came the basket and the balloon, and, as I was snapping away with my camera, I was invited to assist in setting up our balloon. As it was early, it was pretty cold, so make sure you bring a coat! As I stepped into the basket, I felt absolutely terrified, wondering what on earth I had got myself into! However, it wasn't in the least bit scary, much more gentle than I expected. We were in the air for about an hour, although I would have liked to spend a bit more time up there. Our pilot made it a morning to remember, constantly keeping us entertained and informed, and presenting us with a certificate and a CD of african music after we had landed. After landing, we took a short walk to the same Berber tent in which we had our pan-au-chocolate, but this time there was a full Moroccan breakfast (a selection of breads and pancakes, hard boiled eggs, tea and coffee) waiting for us. After breakfast, we were given a guided tour around the traditional Berber house, which was fascinating and informative, and then we were driven to a palmerie for a camel ride. Having done camel rides before, I have to admit that I didn't feel particularly safe on this one. We had 6 camels, and just 2 guides, and I felt that there should have been one guide to lead each camel. Instead, all the camels were tied together in a long line, and whenever we stopped, my camel was trying to pull free! We were back at our hotel before midday, so we had plenty of time in the rest of the day for more sight-seeing or shopping. It was a fantastic experience! It cost 1990 dirhams for a public tour (roughly \u00a3150, including pick-up, breakfast, camel ride, and drop-off), so I think it was excellent value for money. Highly recommended."

As the basket was being held down by his team and the first group got out, our family of 5 got in and away we went! Hamid was an excellent pilot as he demonstrated a \"touch and go\" as he brushed the top of a large bush and then rose into the air again, but the best part of the trip was his hilarious, out-going personality! He had us laughing the entire time as we floated above the wheat fields and grazing areas. Although it was a little hazy, we still saw the High Atlas Mountains in the distance and Marrakech. He landed the basket in the back of his truck as it was guided into the truck bed by his team. As we watched the balloon being deflated and bundled for transport, we were given certificates of our flight. We had a wacky drive to a compound where we had a Berber breakfast and mint tea. We had a nice conversation with Hamid and his wife Lina, who arranges the tours via email. On our way back to our riad we stopped at the Palmeraie, but we opted only to have a photo shoot with the camels as we already had ridden them in the Sahara desert during our 3-day tour. Many thanks to Hamid and Lina - maybe we'll see them in California this summer!"

We were picked up from the hotel just after 6am by Mustafa and driven out to a berber village which felt miles away! We arrived at a little tented garden adjacent to what I can only describe as a compound which obviously had families and cattle living in! We had a tea/coffee with pastries and were then greeted by Hamid our pilot (warning he comes across a little mad) who's incredibly charismatic and we really appreciated his humour as it made the whole experience even better. We were then driven over to the balloon where we watched it being inflated by the crew which is fascinating to see. I was first to jump in to the basket, I was incredibly apprehensive of how safe I would feel being 100's metre in the air with nothing but a wicker basket seperating me and a long drop!! Surprising I was not frightened or concerned as we started to float into the sky, I think the peaceful silence helped this, it was so tranquil. We watched the sun rise from behind the Atlas Mountains which is just beautiful and Hamid pointed out some landmarks, we could just about see the Katoubia Mosque through the early morning mist and also the crater he had apparently 'crashed' into last week! All joking aside Hamid is obviously very skilled at what he does! After a very very gentle landing we were driven back to the berber village where we had breakfast in the tent and served mint tea. I was then very fortunate to have a cuddle with the cutest tiny baby goat! 1 tip try to go toilet before you leave the hotel! The toilet will not be to everyones taste!We were then driven to the palmeraie to ride camels, I was not best pleased with shakira trying to bite me so refused to get on her and went for a calmer looking one at the back!! We had a little ride around the thousands of palm trees in the grove whilst holding on for dear life!We were back to the hotel by 11am and haven't stopped looking at our photos since!

Overall my experience is just amazing because this is my first ride so I dont have any expectation. Really reccommend to try this package!!!!!"

Very professional - everything as promised from the pick up by our Riad at 6am, coffee and cake whilst the sun was coming up, hot air balloon ride followed by breakfast then camel ride. A great experience. The crew and everyone involved are very friendly and welcoming and as the Berber family who hosted us for breakfast are owners of the company I felt totally comfortable accepting their hospitality. It was my fist hot air balloon ride and I would happily recommend Marrakech By Air"

The joked around, but we always felt safe and looked after. Picked up as arranged at 6am, driven to the crews village where we were served tea/coffee and buns. Watched the balloon being inflated, and had a smooth take off. Great views and lots of information underway. Captain even managed to land the balloon on the flat bed truck, which was impressive. Then it was breakfast (fruit, breads, jams etc) at the village before being taken to the camels. Camel ride was perhaps the most disappointing. The animals looked bald in places, and the 5 minute 'walk' (all camels tied together with one guy walking in front) through a few scabby palm trees just off the main road. But all told this was a great morning and a fab way to see more than just Marrakech town. Highly recommended."

We speaks excellent English! We were picked up at 5.00am for a drive out of Marrakech. Refreshments were served and it was touch and go whether or not we would be able to take off as there was some wind. However, as the sun rose the wind dropped and off we went. It was so peaceful and quiet drifting over the Berber villages towards the Atlas Mountains. We all loved it. Back at base we were served a Berber breakfast then drove back to Marrakech where we had a ride on Dromerdary camels in the Palmerai. Afterwards we were dropped back to our riads and hotels.It was a great experience - thank you so much Hamid and the team!P.S.

The balloon ride is surreal, you take off without realising it and float through incredible scenery as the sun rises on the horizon. Hamid the pilot and Mustafa the driver take care of you from start to finish, with stories and banter to make you laugh throughout. The camel ride is a great, fun aspect of the day and is made better by the personal touches Hamid and Mustafa add. I arranged this as a surprise for my girlfriend and she loved it, saying it was one of the best things she'd ever done. On a personal note I have to say that Hamid and Mustafa reinforced my faith in human nature with their reaction to hearing that we had suffered a robbery after our flight, they went way above and beyond to ensure that we still had an unbevievable holiday and we could see the joy in their faces as they helped us out (don't want to go too far into details but they are fantastic people, it is a great day and you will never regret going on this trip!)"

There's a moment when the pilot asks you to crouch down in the basket before lift off, and shortly thereafter he tells you to rise and as you rise slowly peaking over the edge - you realise the balloon has lifted off the ground and you didn't feel a thing and there you are in the air. It's a rather indescrible feeling at the moment - you really feel like you're light as a feather suspended in the air. It's magical and that's what a hot air balloon ride is all about - MAGICAnd watching the sunrise from the air - is another magic experience.It's a unique experience in beautiful country, and the staff are really superb - the pilot is a rare individual with an amazing sense of humour.After the ride, you're presented with a certificate and CD of Moroccan music (which I thought was a really thoughtful memento). After the ride you also treated to a dromedary (camels only in Egypt) ride in the palmarie near Marrakech.Thanks for a wonderful experience"

We had an amazing balloon ride for an hour as the sun rose over the Atlas mountains and then we were taken back to the village for a full continental breakfast afterwards, followed by a camel ride for 30 mins and delivered back to our door.Our pilot Hamid (or the Moroccon Aldo Zilli) was the most endearing character, with perfect english and school boy sense of humour. Beyond the laughs, he was also extremely knowledgeable and interesting when answering questions or explaining the more technical aspects of the flight.The camel ride was fun but 30 mins was the perfect amount of time and we met some lovely people who we met later to have lunch with and will keep in touch with.I personally think it was great value for money at approx \u00a3140pp but I am glad I booked it in advance as I would not be inclined to spend \u00a3300 spontaneously on an 'experience' when arriving at a holiday destination.I also recommend seeking Mustapha's advice if you fancy a wonderful private day long tour of the Atlas Mountains."

A great touch was a huge breakfast before we set off in a rural setting that felt very authentic. The balloon ride itself was at least an hour and that was just about right. They provided water and fruit on landing as well. The camel ride was the best I have ever had, you get a camel each and sit on the actual camel as oppose to in a basket on the side like in a lot of places. The camels also looked to be very well cared for which was good to see. A very enjoyable trip that felt like we had been out for a whole day but due to the early start we were pleasantly surprised to be returned to our door around lunchtime.

To see the sunrise and the Atlas mountains all I one trip was amazing. We didn't even notice we had taken off it was that smooth and during the flight it was so peaceful. A must do trip and really happy through out the trip. Once again thanks to the pilot for our early morning wake up call and all the staff it was great. Iwona and Alex. May 25th."

            "review": "An amazing experience. Those visiting Marrakesh will find it an enjoyable city with lots of activities within the city center, but sometimes the busy atmosphere can get a little much. Our trip with Marrakesh by Air proved to be the perfect break from this all.Despite having had to wake up early, we soon forgot time when the jeep picked us up right at our riad and took us to the starting point, where a light breakfast was waiting for us. After having enjoyed this breakfast under the rising sun, we drove to the balloon and started our flight under the command of the ever-funny and unforgettable captain Hamid. Despite this being our first balloon flight ever, we were instantly in love with the beautiful views from up in the air. The trip takes about 1 to 1,5 hours and gave us ample time to get an excellent alternate view of Marrakesh, the countryside and the Atlas mountains under a rising morning sun. After the flight we were driven in SUVs to our first real berber breakfast in a tent, soon followed by the final item on the menu: the camel ride. Early in the afternoon we were on our way back home.We'll certainly remember the Morrocan countryside, the ever friendly staff, the excellent breakfast in the berber tent and the truly incredible captain Hamid.We can certainly recommend this to anyone looking for something to do outside Marrakesh during their stay in the city. We're sure you'll enjoy this as much a we did."

And the team added a few laughs for free!Added extra: a quick, but fascinating look at a Berber house, with Berber breakfast, and then a camel ride. Downside: the balloon trip was too short, and the camel ride, while great for the kids, is not much in the way of value added. I would happily have swapped that for an extra half hour in the air (whether that is a practical option, I don't know)."

            "review": "Fabulous Flight and Worthy Excursion. A must do excursion while in Marrakech. We were a group of 15 and were loaded into SUVs in the very early dark hours of the morning; in the end it was worth every lost minute of sleep! Upon arrival to the balloon launch site we were greeted by a Berber family serving a smorgasbord of delicious Berber baked goods, strong coffee and of course mint tea served in a lushly decorated tent outside their home. With 15 of us it took three launchs and I was in the last group so the ride out to the balloon was a bit long as the first and second group had each headed a couple miles out from where they started. The balloon captain was extremely friendly and very funny. Turns out he learned how to balloon on YouTube (joke). Being a pilot myself (airplane) I felt very safe and confident in his skill. Especially when the winds picked up and he had to navigate us over some power lines and take us down before we headed into the mountains. It was a controlled \"crash\" landing bouncing us several times before the basket landed and then he tipped us over on our side to complete the touch down (not scary or unsafe at all). It was an exhilarating experience. The sunrise was superb. The views were spectacular. A peaceful and unique way to see the countryside. After the balloon rides we headed out for a camel ride. This was really more of a photo op rather than a \"ride\". Everyone mounted their camels, we were tied together in a line, and we tromped off across the street through some palm trees and brush, not very picturesque, where we stopped for pictures and then turned back for a few minutes ride and dismount. Overall a worthy excursion and great way to spend the morning away from the hustle and bustle of the medina. Very professional tour, highly recommend. Was a highlight of our trip."

We had investigated this trip before going to Morocco but we phoned up to book and got onto a trip the next day (I'd recommend trying to book with Lina (the pilot's wife) by email before you leave though - make sure you leave a mobile number they can contact you on as sometimes trips can be cancelled due to the weather). We went on a thursday morning but this flight got cancelled as the crew were trying to inflate the balloon as the pilot said it was too windy - he wasn't happy taking the balloon up. We were put on the flight the following day without question though (you don't pay until the end of the trip which was good in this case!)It sounds like a lot of money at 1990Dh (~\u00a3160) but is worth every penny! We were picked up at 05.10 from the main square in the Medina by Mustafa in his LandCruiser for the ~30 minute journey to the site. There were 6 of us in the car and were met by 3 more people for breakfast in the Berber house (this was brilliant, but at 06.00 in the morning, was far too much food!) while the crew inflated the balloon. Once we were in the basket, the time in the air was about 40 minutes. You don't go right over Marrakech due to flight path restrictions etc but you can see the Atlas mountains, the Palmerie and all the rest of the beautiful countryside. It really is amazing. The pilot, Hamid, was very funny (although the jokes got a bit much towards the end!) and put us all at ease. In fact, all his staff were great. After the balloon, we got on the camels in the Palmerie for a short trip and were back to our hotel by 08.45!This is an absolute must. The photos are incredible and the whole experience is very well run by Hamid and his team. Marrakech by Air is one of only two licensed hot air balloon flight trips available in Morocco! Make sure you go!"

We were picked up around 5am from our Riad with others and taken to the balloon. We scoffed a croissant and some coffee in the Berber tent while we watched Hamid and his helpers inflate the balloon with the moon in the sky and the sun starting to rise. We got into the balloon with ease and peacefully floated into the air. Hamid puts you at such ease that you don't even realise that you have floated thousands of feet up into the air. The view is of the hazy Atlas mountains, the sun rising and berber village and surrounding land. We stayed in the air for around an hour having laughs with Hamid and silent peaceful moments away from the hubbub of Marrakech. When you land the 4x4 picks you up and transports you back to the tent for a Berber breakfast of pancakes, breads, oranges and cake. After we filled our already round holiday bellies to the max. we headed for our Camel ride. It was such a great experience and highly recommended."

Our Friday morning flight was cancelled because of high winds but superb communication from Marrakesh Air kept us informed that we would be transferred to the Sunday morning.The v.comfortable 4x4 picked us up from our hotel at 6.40am as advised and we were driven out into country to rendevous with the balloon which we tracked for about 20mins.The previous trips passengers were about to disembark while the groundcrew held down the basket only for the pilot Hamaid to lift them back up into the air with one of the groudcrew still hanging below! At which point I thought what have we let ouselves in for here!! Anyhow we jumped into the basket with Hamaid cracking quipes all the time and before you knew it we were off, the safety briefing consisted of: don't jump as there was no bungee ropes attached and don't touch the burner as the pilot didn't like white chicken kebabs.We rose to 3000ft with spectacular views of the atlas mountains, berber farms and surrounding countryside and everytime you started to relax into the tranquility of the experience it was punctuated by our pilot with another one liner, when was he going to shut up? Answer he didn't, so in true British resilliance I decided it was time to go with the flow and give as good as we were getting. What a hoot! As for being 3000ft up in the air you didn't even notice it, the world seems flat up there.We landed and watched as the balloon was packed away and it was off for breakfast, the ride in the Land Rover was as enjoyable as the flight. A delicious traditional breakfast served in the warming morning sun was followed by another white knuckle ride to the camels. Great fun splitting your difference astide the dromadary!we were then transported back to our hotel to find the bottle of tranquilsers!!In summary I was expecting a tranquil balloon flight and a leisurely ride on a camel.What you get is a 'themepark ride' but if you go with the flow it was nevertheless great fun."

We were picked up near our hotel in the medina, driven out to the edge of the desert mountains to watch our balloon float in while enjoying a small breakfast and tea/coffee, taken up in a hot air balloon for over an hour of floating over the mountains, desert, and Berber villages, driven to a Berber village for a full delicious Berber breakfast, and finally driven out to ride camels in the palmaries before being dropped back off at our hotel. The air balloon pilot was great. We had a group of French, spanish, and Americans and he cracked jokes continuously in all 3 languages. The flight was smooth and effortless. Those scared of hights will be surprised how NOT scary it is to fly in a hot air balloon. The floor underneath you is alway stable, no turbulence, and the tall sided basket helps keep you feeling secure. The view from the air was amazing. The pilot varried the hight (up to 4,0000ft) so you could get a great view of the country side and a birds eye view of the Berber villages. The camel ride was quiet and relaxing as we wove through the palms and the camels were nice and friendly. There were even baby camels to play with and take pictures of. Bring a good camera and video camera to capture an experience of a life time. Your friends will be so jelous! Totally worth the money, even for a poor traveling student like me!"

This trip 'ticked a box' of my husband's Wish List so it will not be forgotten in a hurry. Part of the trip also included riding on a camel.

Generous breakfast and guided tour around a Berber smallholding not to be missed, with a camel ride, just long enough to complete the trip. Great with teenagers."

We were picked up by Mustafa - as told exact on time at 6.10am from our riad, Picked up some others on the way and headed to the open air with the beautiful mountain backdrop. We were welcomed by hot drinks and pain au chocolat (bit too early for me). We then saw the balloon being blown up and it was a lot of fun to try to get us off the ground! Hamid the pilot was fantastic. The views are amazing and he has you in fits of laughter throughout. Even whilst leaving Hamid put a smile on our face with his spectacular driving skills. You are then taken to one the crew members house where his family treat you to a lovely berber breakfast, The family are warming and let you have a full walk around to take a look. Mustafar then takes you on a scenic drive to the camel ride. Very friendly people who are happy to take photos. Not once were we hassled about tipping anyone from start to finish which makes you want to give something to them. Thought prior to booking was expensive but worth every penny and recommended to all. Thank you to all the team!"

Mainly because you subsequently find out you paid twice as much to the cabby/tour guide/merchant as you could have done.However, while paying for a trip with Marrakech By Air is among the more expensive things in the city, you will genuinely feel that it's worth every dirham!We were picked up from our hotel at 7:20am by Mustapha in time to arrive for the second flight of the day at 8:30. Weather was great and it perked us up for the arrival of the perma-perked pilot Hamid! What a character! His constant smiling is infectious and his competence at the helm after seven years of piloting is impressive. His command of English is the best among all the Moroccans we encountered in our six days.From the moment we took off, we could feel our bellies tingling with excitement! When you're up there, It's both exhilarating and tranquil. An amazing mix of emotions. There's complete silence other than the odd burst of flame from the jets and it sets you up wonderfully to enjoy the 360 degree panoramic views of Marrakech's tundra. We got up to 3,000ft and Hamid even let us shoot a few bursts of flame into the balloon to make us even more part of the experience.After we landed, we were whisked off to a nearby berber house to enjoy a traditional berber breakfast of various breads, preserves and olives. While not that memorable, it gave us a chance to reflect on the balloon ride.The final part of the package was a 30 minute camel ride. It's all well organised and pleasant enough but definitely a do-it-once thing as horse rides are more enjoyable.Overall, it's all about the hot air balloon ride! A completely unforgettable experience and one you'll struggle to find fault with. Thanks, Hamid! Hope to see you for a sunrise flight one day."

You will be dragged from your hotel at 5:30 in the morning, shovelled into a creaky old landrover and driven at high speed through dark and empty back streets of Marrakech. Arriving out at the freezing launch site just before the sun rises, you will have 5 minutes to gulp down steaming hot coffee and croissants before being packed into a tiny basket with complete strangers.But it is all worth it! The view over the mountains as the sun rises is magical, the experience of floating silently over the farms as the animals wake up and the landscape goes from grey to purple to golden brown is incredible.Then you land (after what feels like far too little time in the air) and you are whisked to the real breakfast - an incredible spread that the 6 of us only barely managed to touch! Then, after a look round the small settlement where the proprietor keeps his ballon (a genuuine local farm) you will drive off again to ride some camels. To be honest, camels are not to everyone's taste - they probably make wonderful pack animals, but they're really not designed to be ridden. Finally, you'll be delivered back to central Marrakech around the time you feel you should have woken up!Not to be missed... amazing views, a side of morocco you wouldn't normally see from marrakech, and the proprietor is great fun!"

At first we were not up to it but since we had already arranged this trip, we did wake up grudgingly and went for the baloon ride afterall. One of our staff from the Riad walked us to the spot where Hamid, the owner of 'Marakkesh by air\" picked us up and drove us to this remote area outside of the city of Marakkesk. Hamid was very informative but he was 'up tempo' and very jovial. He even got off the land rover and let it drive by itself and he was running alongside which was funny and laughable. By the time we arrived at the area from where we were to take off in the baloon I was wide awake and actually enjoying the ride.On arrival to the desert,one hour from town, we were served hot coffee and croissants, while at the same time the baloon was being inflated. We had never been on a baloon ride and so we were looking forward to this experience. We did not even feel the baloon take off and the weather was really calm and fantastic. Hamid, as usual, was full of jokes but kept us feeding information on our whereabouts. The sun rising over the Atlas mountains was spectacular. We have seen many sunrises over the ocean and mountains and this was one of a kind. we were about 3500 feet above ground, the maximum altitude the baloon can go, when the sun rose. Below us were a few Berber villages and farms. Our descent was gradual and the landing was smooth. After the baloon ride, we had a sumptuous Berber breakfast after which we went on a camel ride.We'd never been on a camel ride but we enjoyed it a lot.The ride was a very short one but it was an unique experience.We had a great time and would recommend this to anyone who wants to try it."

I'm not a morning person but 6a.m. was a very good time to speed out of the city to a Berber village for breakfast. Hamed, our driver and pilot kept us entertained throughout. Multi-lingual and skilled at his job, he constantly explained what he was doing and why. Us ladies clambered into the basket on its side then the men climbed over when the balloon was inflated and the basket upright. As we began to rise it was to the sound of our extrovert pilot shouting to the whole of North Africa, 'Prepare to die......I mean fly!'It was a beautiful experience seeing the sunrise over the Atlas Mountains and floating over Morocco with the balloon shadow in the distance. After a gentle landing we headed off for a camel ride at the Palmerie, which I also adored. I wasn't sure if the bellowing of the baby camels on our return was because they were pleased to see the rest of the herd or because it coincided with the arrival of a large cart full of food that looked like overgrown celery!It occurred to me that the rides had one notable thing in common. The silence. The drifting balloon and the camels feet padding across the sand.......both blissfully peaceful."

After being driven outside the City to the departure location you are served croissants & mint tea...another lovely amenity. After the balloon ride, where you land near wheat fields where the farmer & his children come to greet you. Then it's off to a Berber household where you are served a beautiful breakfast and get to spend some time with the family who lives there as well as their children & animals. A camel (dromedery) ride in the Palmerie tops off the experience & is quite fun. All in all, well worth the time & expense."

The professionalism, both organisational and flying skill , was evident from the moment we enquired and throughout. Hamid our pilot was very personable and we had great fun as he provided an experience never to forget. This flight is relatively expensive as Moroccan tourist attractions goes but this is one of those that is worth splurging on. The anticipation mounts as you travel in the dark to a remote area, a quick bite to eat, (we helped steady the balloon canopy when inflating), and enjoy magnificant views of Berber life below, mountains and Marrakech in the distance. Allah smiled on us with perfect weather and breeze. We then had a huge Berber breakfast before being returned to Marrakech for a camel ride. Inevitably the camel ride is a little touristy and relatively short as you are led through date plantations but nevertheless these were very appealing and friendly camels and it is rare that you can get up so close.These camels also had several young and our teenage children loved it (as did we)."

The pickup was on time,the driver safe, the balloon ride itself was beautiful and made great fun by Hamids jocular conversation. Breakfast in the Berber ladies home was plentiful and tasty, then on to the camel ride which was a tourist experience but very relaxed and the kids had as much time as they wished to feed and pat the camels. This was a lovely way to see some of this beautiful country and experience some of the warm,friendly and gentle hospitality of the people. A nice break out of the crazy but alluring Marrakech.

I would have been happy to skip this part, but the other people seemed to enjoy themselves. I haven't given this 5 stars simply because of this but had it been on the breakfast experience and balloon ride alone it would definitely be a 5!We were then transported back to our Riad's and we still had a good part of the day left to explore the Souks.

Hamid joked with us about landing on the trailer, and then - to our amazement - actually did manage to land the balloon on the back of the trailer.We had a fantastic time in the balloon, but the whole experience - the breakfast, the camel ride and the balloon ride - was fantastic.We would happily recommend them to anyone visiting Marrakech, but note you do need to book in advance, and be prepared that the weather may force you to change plans, so you may need to make allowance to move the date during your visit.Thanks to the team for a fantastic experience!!"

I was disappointed with the actual balloon ride and could have spent the \u00a3160 on something else.Marrakech airport is just outside the city so the height of the flight area is restricted. Also there is little air movement so you don't travel far, in any direction. Basically you just go up into the air, watch the sun rise (we didn't even see Marrakech city from the air) and come down almost in the same spot.The whole experience was enjoyable though - leaving at 5am, driving into the \"desert\", watching the balloon inflate, taking off in the still of the morning when no-one else is around, eating a wonderful breakfast in a tent, then a short camel ride on the way back, before home by 9.30am with still a full day ahead."

Other companies only do the balloon ride so it was nice to incorporate other things too.On the whole, excellent experience and one that I will never forget.

The price was putting me off, but I\u2019m glad we did it as I would of regretted it majorly. There\u2019s a reason there #1.Pickup from the hotel, in an SUV. driven through Marrakech and into the dessert. The city is totally deserted at this time, quite tranquil, good contrast in its self. Coffee and a large pan de chocolate type roll, gave a good chance to chat to the other passengers break the ice etc. Met with the balloon. (they had taken a flight up already) The banter and jokes from the \u2018captain\u2019 started straight away, very, very funny. From in the Balloon you can see for miles, I\u2019ve never been to such a dessert'y area before so I thought it was stunning/great. Don\u2019t know how long we where up, but it seemed about right (couple of hours at a guess). On the way down the pilot actually landed the balloon in the trailer of the 4x4, perfect landing. Then lunch at a baber house. And a look round, my female friend got pictures holding a lamb and kitten, she was loving it. Then off for a camel ride. People warned me camels are smelly, bad tempered etc. These where fine, friendly etc, got some photos patting a baby on the head. 15-20mins on the camels was enough for the experience. Then SUV back to the hotel, though I\u2019m sure they would drop you anywhere. We forgot our certificates, which where dropped off at the hotel later, which was a nice surprise.Well organised, well thought out and a great morning excursion. The pilot was great, very funny (purposely not described jokes etc as to not ruin it).In the afternoon we did a half day quad trek with dunes and dessert which was also very good. But defiantly for the younger crowd (where mid-late 20\u2019s)"

He turned a bunch of sleepy groggy tourists in his jeep to wide awake excited tourists by the time we got to the desert and the whole operation was perfectly timed to ensure we enjoyed sunrise thousands of feet above the ground...priceless.This truly is an all round experience from the drive into the desert, watching the team setup the balloon whilst you have breakfast in by the fire, the traditional berber breakfast afterwards, the tour of the village house and the camel rides. This is a no brainer...Hamid, don't change a thing!"

Visiting the Berber house was a really humbling experience, and the camel ride was a lot of fun. Even my Mum got on board and, although cautious at first, really enjoyed the camel ride. I'd thoroughly recommend fitting this in to your trip, we were there for just a few days and it was definately worth it. Just make sure you book a few days before you go. We were a little concerned because we booked it via the UK office over the phone from Marrakech, and didn't hear from the Marrakech organisers - they rang our riad to arrange pick up the afternoon before, so it all came through and we had a great time."

I got the dates of our arrival wrong and had to send a date change request, all taken care of easily and quickly. Pick-up at our hotel was prompt at 5.20am. Hammid was our pilot and spoke at least 4 languages, with a great understanding of jokes and slang. He was very humorous and kept us awake at that early hour. The balloon was laid out and up fast with the help of an excellent 4 man crew. This occured at sunrise and we were up just after the sun came up over the mountains. The ride was quiet, peaceful and serene. Breakfast at the Berber village was very eyeopening to this American who lives with many luxuries often taken for granted, like a handle on my broom. They are very proud of their home but I wouldn't last an hour. The camel ride, which was my sole purpose for this excursion, was very short, and it's a good thing. They are uncomfortable and cranky. But fun all the same. This is a great way to see the desolate and hard desert and real life for many of these people. One note not found on their website and given to us incorrectly at our hotel, they DO NOT take credit cards-CASH ONLY. It was $512.00 for us two, and it took the vast amount of our cash on hand to go anyway. This is not a city you really want to have to try the ATM/banks for cash. You want to bring it all with you. Bring extra to pay this trip, they take any and all currencies."

Hamid phoned me around dinner time on the Wednesday evening to give us as much notice as he could. We were picked up at 5.30am and driven (quickly!) to a rural spot outside Marrakech and provided with pastries for breakfast whilst Hamid and his team set up the balloon. It was very smooth and everything was comfortable and we had lift off!The balloon ride itself was unbelievable, totally surreal experience as it was my first time. There were 8 people in our balloon plus Hamid but we had plenty of room for photos etc. After a very comfortable landing we met some of the local Berber kids who ran out to meet us (bring pens and paper if you can as gifts, but not money as they will stay away from school). Hamid then drove us to a local berber house and we were given a great breakfast and a tour around their home. Everything was really tasty and the family were very welcoming.After all of this I would have given 5 stars already but then we went for a camel trek in the Palmerie and it was brilliant, and my girlfriend's highlight of the holiday. Hamid then drove us back into the centre of Marrakech and even allowed us to pick-up our suitcase before driving us onto Les Bains de Marrakech as we were short for time. This was very much appreciated so thanks again Hamid if you are reading!Hamid really does deserve a big mention as the other reviews have said, he has so much energy early in the morning but it just makes you feel very comfortable and relaxed. He certainly gets his group into a good mood with plenty of laughs!Definitely a highlight of my trip to marrakech amongst many brilliant moments."

We were picked up at 6 am but unfortunately for us that was 5 am as the clocks had went forward that night!!! It was a very early start but well worth it for what followed.Hamid our pilot was the only person who could keep us awake at that untimely hour with his jokes and one liners (his grasp of the English Language is outstanding).Our morning had to be moved around slightly as the wind was initially to strong to put the balloon up so we had breakfast first which was excellant but I have to say we did not eat much as the nerves had already started to kick in!!Watching the balloon be inflated was such an amazing experience and it was hilarious to see my husband selected to help. I have never seen him work so hard and then he had to scramble to get in the balloon as we had already started to take off.The whole flight experience was amazing and for the first few minutes took our breath away. It is so peaceful and lovely to see the beautiful surroundings and Berber villages.Hamid keeps his humour going throughout the whole flight and certainly makes it an experience you will never forget.It is most certainly a trip that everyone should experience when in Marrakech and a visit to Marrakech would not be complete without the balloon trip. This was a surprise anniversary present for my husband so he will have to top that next year!"

It was a fantastic way to the occassion. We made the booking by email and had a response almost immediaetly. On the day of our trip, he arrived to collect us from the Riad on time at around 5:30am. After a trip to the middle of nowhere we watched the team setting up the balloon whilst drinking coffee and eating croissants and then had an absolutley fantastic flight, watching the sunrise. After landing we visited a berber home and had breakfast there, the food was lovely but unfortunately the bees from a nearby farm also wanted to enjoy the delicacies. We then went on a camel ride, to finish off a superb time. We thoroughly enjoyed the trip and would have no hesitation on recommending it. Hamid and his wife are lovely people who do all they can to make it a marvellous experience."

We were really looking forward to our flight this past week in Marrakech, but circumstances beyond control prevented us from flying.We had our flight booked but when we called to confirm, we were told that the flight had been cancelled because the King was in town. We were very disappointed as we had booked it months in advance and we were looking forward to the balloon flight above everything else. We hoped the flight could be rescheduled later in the week, but no clearance could be given to fly.From other reviews, the experience sounded amazing. This review is just to warn others about the possibility of disappointment, not to slag off the company. So, it's best to check with the Marrakech By Air about the King being in town, so you can plan your time accordingly. We hope to fly if we come back to Marrakech."

Neither of us had taken a balloon flight before and had little idea what to expect. Bad weather forced cancellation of the original flight but next day we were airborne. Pick up from the Square was on time, we collected the rest of our party on the way and we were off.Breakfast was welcome as we waited for the team to bring and set up the balloon. Hamid the pilot is everything you\u2019ve read and more. In England the saying \u201cmad as a balloon\u201d will henceforth be \u201cmad as a balloon pilot\u201d He is incredibly funny with a whole armoury of hilarious one liners. The balloon ride was incredible, silent and smooth high above the ever changing Berber landscape. We all loved the \u201ctouch and go\u201d \u2013 (Balloon and 4x4!) It was fun spotting the crew following us on the ground. It seemed like all too soon the flight had to come to an end but the landing was fun if a little tricky for the crew.Then it was off to the Berber house for a splendid brekkie served in comfy tent. The traditional breakfast of bread, honey, olive oil, pancakes, fruit, the list could go on and on was lovely and served with coffee and \u201cBerber Whisky\u201d Hamid brought a young goat to see us and it was instantly a hit with the lads from our party . I\u2019m sure Hamid will introduce all his guests to the \u201cBanana pig\u201d, I\u2019ll say no more so as not to spoil it for future balloonists. After that it was off for a look around the Berber House; we saw the Berber microwave, hammam and traditional kitchen. Once finished with the tour it was back to Marrakech and the camel ride in the PalmerieHamid gave us an incredible experience that was fun from start to finish. If you only do one trip while in Marrakech, make sure it\u2019s this one."

From the moment I emailed to request a reservation the service was excellent - pretty much an immediate reply and then the day before a call to arrange our meeting place. Due to staying inside the medina the meeting place was arranged for outside a mosque just after 5.30am. This was a little daunting as having only been in Marrakech for 2 days we were still finding our way around and this is no mean feat! So our lovely rhiad hostess took us to the meeting place early the next morning and we were on our way.Sunrise was fabulous - weather was not too cold and we were up and away following a coffee at the open air fire. The pilot was very funny and his jokes came thick and fast.Everyone enjoyed their time and loads of great photos were taken across the snow capped Atlas mountains which were not too far off in the distance.After landing breakfast was taken in the Berber home which was an eye opener to say the least for the materialistic westerners taking this balloon ride. Following the fabulous breakfast complete with baby goat frolicking around our feet - we were then taken to a spot closer to town to ride a camel. This was a short ride but definitely long enough - we were lucky enough to have 4 baby camels with our train one of which was only 3 wks old - very cute!Then it was home again and all this by around 11am - great morning had by all.Overall excellent experience and definitely a highlight of our trip to Marrakech."

            "review": "Excellent excursion despite the weather. I can only agree with what others have already said - pilot Hamid has missed his vocation and should be on the stage, he worked tirelessly to keep the energy of the group high and make sure that the whole outing was very good fun, not just the balloon ride. If it were just about the balloon trip we would have felt very disappointed because we had horrible cold, misty weather and I still feel that perhaps the flight should have been postponed until the following day. We went up in the balloon through the mist and floated above the clouds in the sunshine but we couldn't see the ground or the mountains which rather knocked the edge off the experience. That is my only reason for giving 4 stars and not 5, since they don't charge you if the balloon doesn't take off there is possibly a tendency to go ahead regardless. In the end, however, the whole 5 hour trip - which included a large breakfast, a camel ride and a nail biting 4x4 drive through the outer reaches of the city - was hugely entertaining and I would thoroughly recommend it. It's also great to do activities which put you with other people for a chance to chat and compare experiences of Marrakech. If we had had good weather and a clear view then I would make this a 5 star trip without hesitation."

Such a contrast to the chaos of the souks and Medina, this excursion is a peaceful and really awesome way to get a different perspective on this part of the world. The quiet gliding over the desert in the balloon at sunrise is for sure the high point, but also the visit to the Berber home and a chance to interact with Hamid and Lina are extras that you won't get through exploring on your own. Hamid and Lina are excellent and make the trip painless - first class service and attentive to every detail. Hamid is the star of he show and a wealth of information and laughs, and of course a great balloon pilot (only matched by his Land Rover driving skills). The came ride is a nice touch at the end - good photo opp, and great for the kids.Lina had us back at our Riad by 11Am with a full day still ahead of us.Do this trip - you won't regret it."

We had a temporary disappointment when we were told the balloon couldn't fly because the King was in town, but we got a last minute call telling us the ban had been lifted and off we went. I was much more nervous than my three boys (5, 8, 10) but the Captain and his lovely wife quickly put me at ease with their jokes and smiles. For all his fooling around, the pilot is a careful and competent flyer who clearly loves his balloon, and his country. What a fantastic ambassador for Morroco. After a thrilling ride, we had a magical breakfast in a Berber home, where the kids were loved up by the locals, and played with baby goats and a patient old donkey. A bonus was a short stop for a camel ride in the Palmerie, where we shared our treck with a baby camel tied alongside her mama. A fantastic day, well worth every penny and more. We loved the experience, and were so impressed with this wonderful couple. They made every effort to ensure we had a fantastic time."

We were collected on time by a very smart 4x4, very comfortable and with the sounds of Morroco in our ears were taken on a mystical morning adventure into the desert where we collected our balloon, we then continued on our desert tour and arrived at a beautiful burber home and welcoming family. The first attempt was not successful as our experienced and very funny pilot Hamid advised, the wind was too strong, so with this we retreated to an exquisite morrocan style breakfast in their beautiful tent looking out as the sun began to rise, the buzz and conversation from the other tourists in our group was great company too. Just as we had finished soaking up the morning, Hamid ran past the tent in his pilot outfit shouting 'Let's go guys!' so we all said farewell to our hosts and ran after Hamid to be the first to jump into the ballon. The flight was absolutley magical, being my first time i was certainly speechless, and the speed that you leave the ground to see the second group dissapear like tiny ants, it just something else. If you haven't experienced the Morrocan landscape from above it is highly recommended, the vast stretches of red carpet stretch to the Atlas mountains like a red carpet, something you must see in your lifetime. The ride in the discovery vechiles to reach the second group ballon landing is just as exciting as being up there, Hamid may even treat you to 'Auto pilot' Fantastic! Absolutley enjoyed my first camel ride and the half day seemed to never end, great value for money. I have recommended to several friends and will be booking with Hamid and team on my next stop in Marrakech. Fantastic memories and AMAZING photographs top boot."

Quite spontaneously we decided to do this trip with Marrakech by air - and it became the most fantastic experience of the whole trip. The whole day was perfect. It was not only the hot air ballon flight, but also a lovely Berber breakfast and a very informative insight into the housing and living of local Berber people. Finally it also included a camel ride! Thus, it is a very good package, when you want to endeavour Marrakech. All the time we felt perfectly safe, because of Hamid who is an experienced pilot and a very friendly gentleman."

We were picked up at our hotel and driven into the desert where we watched the first group land. I am not sure that seeing the landing before taking off is advisable as the balloon basically dragged the four helpers until it stopped in a bush. Nevertheless, Capt. Hamid welcomed us aboard and took us up 1200 metres. Hamid plays both the consummate professional and practical joker the whole time. After we landed in a field, we were whisked away to a Berber village to see how the indiginous people of Morocco live. We were welcomed into their home. The final part of the package was the camel ride. Hamid never stopped making us laugh and informing us of customs, history and knowledge of the area. Apart from visiting the country, this was the highlight of our trip."

I had read so many good reviews about this company so before going to Marrakech I booked this as a present for my Husband as it was out 17th wedding anniversary.My husband loves flying of any nature and has a pilot's lisence for small aircraft.When I told Hamid this he said he would make it extra special by letting Tim help set up, fly and land the balloon. Fantastic!! I on the other hand am scared of heights (I must love my husband very much!!) Hamid again said no problem it was extremely safe and he would make sure I was ok.He picked us up at 5.30am (again I must love my husband!!) and right from the start had us laughing all the way to the countryside where the balloon ride would start. He picked up others along the way and gave every single person (french, dutch english) all special attention.It was great fun helping and watching the ballon being set up from the beggining and lovley to have fresh coffee and couisants too.When it was out turn to get in I was nervous but he let me go in the middle of the basket and talked to us the whole time making us laugh. We went 3000 feet up as the sun had just risen and the views were amazing!! He explained what he was doing all the time and the whole trip was so imformative and fun it went very quickly even though we were up for about an hour. We even flew over a village. Landing was fun too as you never quiet know where you will land and as it was breezy we landed in a farm! all the local children were so delighted to see a balloon land they came out to us on donkeys to say hello. We then had a fabulous breakfast in a bedwin tent and had a tour of a real home for two families seeing how they lived was so humbling and refreshing.We finished off being taken to another location for a camel ride.The who experience was beyond our expectations and my husband loved it so much he now want to learn to fly a balloon too! thank you so much Hamid and Lina you were fantastic - so much so that we have told our friends to book with you when they come out in November."

The balloon ride itself was something i will never forget - the views, peace, and sedate pace was simply magical. It was really interesting to visit the Berber tent and learn about the local people. We were not particularly fussed about the camel ride - however were pleasantly surprised, as it was actually a lot of fun. The pilot and owner of the company (i forget his name) is an awesome guy - hilarious and very good company. A born entertainer, and he certainly did a lot to make it so special."

He contacted Lina and Hamid before we flew out to Morocco and they arranged a private pick up from our hotel and drove us into the desert, we could see the main group of tourists already in the air for their flight experiencing the morning sunrise over the mountains. We then had our own private flight and they gave us a crew member to filma nd take photos. They made the whole day a complete suprise for me and a very magical experience.After the hot air balloon ride we had breakfast in a local house, the famile are very accommodating and we do recommend you leave the family a little gift of a small amount of money as a thank you but its not pushed upon you to do this. After this, we went to a different part of town and had a camel treck which doesn't take long but they have a good team arranging the camels, they stop people trying to sell you things and they won't ask you for money for taking photos. Our guide for the camels was actually very good at taking photos so we have some perfect momentos of a perfect day.Remember, Lina and Hamid are very accommodating of any special requests if you want to make your day special so do contact them in advance.Don't panic if you see a rainy forecast for your trip in the balloon, call the team and they can advise, they have hourly updates from the airport for the weather, it only really rains in December and January."

After the flight more breakfast at a local home which provided an insight into Marrakech life which is unrivalled. After this the arranged camel ride just added to the whole experience.I would recomment this company to anyone visiting Marrakech.

We were collected at 5.15 am and as we were a little lost, Hamid jogged to find us (with a smile) and take us to the waiting land rover. It was an early start but worth it to be in the air to see the sunrise. The whole set up was very well organised and professional. We had never been on a balloon before so it was all very exciting. I suppose the view itself is not so spectacular but Hamid told us about the Berber villages and the ride itself was great. After landing we had a great breakfast and went to see a typical Berber house, which was interesting- I never realised that even in the middle of nowhere these mud brick huts still have their own hammams. The trip also included a brief camel ride which was a laugh and nice to have ticked off the 'to do' list. Highly recommended!"

We were then given an inspiring tour by Hamid of the Berber Village itself and its workings.After this we drove to the camels and were taken on a camel ride across the deserty area.The whole experience is fun-filled and with 3 different activities you feel you definitely get your money's worth!!

As the sun began to rise (with fantastic photographic opportunities) we took to the skies, and experienced one of the most surreal and calm flights ever, with amazing views across Marrakech, the palmeries and the Atlas mountains! Add to this the delicious breakfast, the tour of a Berber House (I wish I could move in!) and a camel ride and you have the makings of a perfect morning in Marrakech. Oh, and you'll never eat boiled eggs in the same way again! ;)Hamid is clearly passionate about what he does which adds to the whole experience and we got the feeling that real effort has been put into ensuring that the whole morning was the best it could possibly be.This was a birthday present for my partner and I think it's fair to say that I've racked up some serious brownie points!

It was a terrific excursion and a truly memorable experience which was made all the more memorable because our guide and pilot, Hamid was such great company. He introduced us to brilliant African music, gave us a knowledgable commentary about the landscape and the people who work the land, took us on a safe and thrilling balloon ride and throughout he was a scream, keeping us laughing the whole time. There are other balloon companies operating in the area but we can't imagine that you could have as much fun with anyone else as we had with Hamid. Anyone staying in Marrakech should definitely book with Marrakech By Air, and say hello to Hamid for us."

I took a tour with this company, which is operated by Captain Hamid and his lovely wife Lina. I had the most wonderful time and this will remain with me as one of the best memory forever. Captain Hamid, Lina & Co, they are the most friendly, honest and lovely people you will meet. I took a hot air balloon tour (comes with many other treks, tour, food, transfer and many more as a standard package). I started early in the morning, you get picked up and return transfer as a package, so you don\u2019t worry about anything, just enjoy. I had lovely breakfast with my miss and prepared the balloon, which was brilliant experience. We rise in the balloon to the open fresh blue sky and watched the beautiful sunrise above us (yes it was very romantic). We did\u2019nt wait for the sun, we went to sun and into the clouds. It was the most beautiful, spectacular aerial scene of nature and landscape, the Atlas Mountain and Orika Valley, clouds, large eagle flying, and most pleasant fresh air. If you go to Marrakech and do not do this magical tour then you have missed out on Marrakech, you might as well cancel you holiday and unpack now!!. Life is too short, so go and book your unforgettable adventure in advance at www.marrakechbyair.com, enjoy the take off to an unforgettable great holiday. One last advice to keep in mind, you will not get such great offer and value for money in UK, Europe etc, and I will definitely do it again. Also this company is always fully booked, so do not waste time and book your place in advance and enjoy......I am sure you will thank me. Shah"

It was the most amazing, invigorating and entertaining way to spend a day. Hamids quick witted humour will have you in stiches as well as experiencing the views of the Atlas Mountains from a hot air balloon. The visit to the Berber village was educational and the food was exceptional, nicely rounded off with a short camel trek. A definite must do excursion if you can - I would recommend it 100%."

I loved every minute of it. As others have mentioned, Hamid and Lina work really hard to make sure everyone enjoys their time with laughs aplenty. The trip around the Berber house was fascinating and highly interesting. The camel trip at the end of the day, although fun, was also pretty demanding physically. Perhaps I was just unlucky but I felt I had to use every ounce of my strength just to stay upright on the thing!! I would highly recommend this trip. It is definitely deserving of its 1st place position in the Tripadvisor ratings."

They go to extraordinary lengths to ensure that everyone enjoys themselves. Even at 5.30 in the morning Hamid is a ball of energy and fun. The visit and breakfast at the berber house was lovely. Instructive and no feeling of intruding on the villagers. Hamid's explanations of the intricacies of ballooning were informative and his team do all the hard work in inflating and packing up the balloon after the flight. Overall a memorable time and good value for what is included in the package. Our teenage kids loved it."

            "review": "Charming Day in Marrakech!. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our day with Hamid and Lina! While my husband helped position the balloon and hold it down during inflation, we watched as six other guests hopped on and floated up, up, and away into the clouds! Soon after, we hopped into the rugged jeep and off we went to chase the balloon! I sat shotgun next to Lina and, like a scene straight out of Twister, we stormed through the open fields of poppys trying to guess where the balloon was going to touch down. This adventure was just as much fun for me as the actual balloon ride itself!When the balloon touched-down, the remaining four of us quickly hopped-on while the others hopped-off. (Hamid invited two lucky passengers to stay on for a bonus ride in effort to keep enough weight in the balloon. Needless to say, they were thrilled! And I was thrilled that Hamid had our safety in-mind!) Due to the high winds, our particular trip only lasted about 25 minutes. But, as with all things in life, it's really about quality, not quantity! While one couple used their stopwatch to precisely time our flight versus the others' flight, I was perfectly content in my own little world up in the clouds. Being a cloudy day, we couldn't really see much of anything, but floating above the clouds was such a special treat in itself!! As if it were written into the script, we had an exciting landing in a lush field of sheep. While the crew quickly packed up the balloon, we signed our certificates and took pictures with Hamid, then my husband and I made the most of our time by playing with the baby lambs nearby. Soon after, we were whisked away to our next desitinations... Breakfast at a traditional Moroccan home and then a whimsical camel ride.Overall I would say this is a great way to spend a morning in Marrakech. Leave your stop watch at home, along with your rigid expectations, and just go with the flow! While we cannot control things like the clouds and the wind, we can control our attitudes! And with Hamid and Lina's infectious energy, you will no doubt leave this excursion with a little more bounce in your step!"

            "review": "Book It !. I booked Marrakesh by Air based on these Trip Advisor reviews and was not disappointed. It was my husband's surprise 40th birthday trip....he was NOT having fun up until Hamid saved me and my trip. Hamid picked us up early in the A.M. and his enthusiasm was contagious. He was the first person to make my husband smile and laugh during our trip. A real victory at that time of the morning. After a drive out to the country side we picked up our ballon and headed out to the launch site. Hamid fixed us a little bite to eat (this is not the main breakfast) and he and his crew went to work setting up the ballon. It was cool to see a hot air ballon being set up. I enjoyed taking pics of the whole process. Once it was up we were up, up and away. Honestly I was scared....I don't even like riding in airplanes but I really enjoyed it. I asked Hamid about his flying experience and he told that he learned from the best in France. He has flown in all types of weather and has been flying for 6 years. The whole time he was in contact with his crew on the ground. They were following us in the SUV. It was a bit cloudy that day so we didn't see the mountains that well but I live in Switzerland so I didn't care to see more mountains anyway. We were able to get good views of Berber villages. Once it was time to land Hamid was very serious about our safety. As you may know with ballon rides you can't control every single detail of the landing. That is the nature of the beast and boy were we happy about it in the end. THE LANDING WAS THE BEST PART !!! We didn't know what to expect. Hamid showed us how the hold on and what not. Then we hit the ground lightly and came up again and down and up....it sounds crazy but the 6 of us in our basket were giggling and yelling like little kids as the basket was dragging along the ground to a stop ! It was soooo much fun !!! Hamid told us the reason he prefers to land that way is because if you try to come straight down with a soft landing you take a risk of a very hard landing. But trust me we all thought the landing was the best part ! We took pictures and just could not stop laughing because it was such a rush ! We were laughing but Hamid was very focused. I would ride all over again just for the landing.  Afterwards we were back in the SUV and heading for breakfast. I took some of my best pictures during the ride to and from the ballon. I was able to take pictures without someone wanting me to pay them which is not the case in the Medina. You're able to see and capture the way Berbers live and work. Then we were welcomed to the Berber breakfast. It was much more food than I expected. A very nice spread. Great mint tea. Then Hamid changed from waiter to tour guide as he walked us through a Berber house and showed us how they live. The people love him there and they would wave at us as we drove by. After that it was time for the camel ride. Once again a nice chance for pictures.  Overall it was worth the money. You're talking about hotel pick-up, hot air ballon ride, seeing the country side, a nice breakfast spread, a camel ride, great (hassle free) pictures and a fantastic host that speaks 6 languages very well (Arabic, French,English, Dutch, Spanish,Berber). That's what I call getting your monies worth. My husband and I travel a lot and take lots of excursions and I must say that this one will stand out in our minds as one of the best. Hamid is a hard worker and deserves 10 stars ! Just know that the ballon ride depends on the weather so if you come down sooner than an hour it's for your safety . Hamid would never cheat his customers. He goes out of his way to make sure that you are happy, getting your monies worth and having a good time. Book It !"

The balloon flight was wonderful - peaceful (apart from a spirited rendition of Happy Birthday for two people), with the Atlas Mountains in the background , as we drifted over Berber villages. The experience wasn't over after the balloon flight - we still had a leisurely breakfast to enjoy, a visit to a Berber home, birthday cake back in the tent and, finally, off for a camel ride. All the way through the morning Hamid was looking out for everyone and making sure we were all fully involved in the experience. He is also deeply committed to working with the Berber people whose land we flew from."

Not sure I've laughed that hard for ages!I can highly recommend this trip to anyone that wants to see the countryside just outside of Marrakech from the air. The weather in Morocco seems perfect for ballooning and it's a great way to start the day. By the time you finish at about midday, you feel like you've already had a full day of adventure and hospitality.Thanks Hamid and your team and I wish you all the best for the future.Andy"

I'd been ballooning before so I knew what to expect and have to disagree with a previous post with someone complaining about landing in a bush. Ballooning is dependent on the weather and the spot where you land is not guaranteed. He is an honest man who cares very much about the people he works with as well as his clients. The trip is a GREAT VALUE!!! You actually feel like you're doing 3 tours in one.Yakiry Malena Guerrero - NYC"

Hamid, the pilot, is an absolute nutter, like a duracell bunny on speed. He goes out of his way to ensure you have a great time, from the moment you're collected (before first light) to when he drops you off, he never stops and the energy levels never wane.The balloon ride is great - much smoother than I was expecting and you are fully involved in the process of getting it inflated (after knocking back a hot drink and a croissant!). The views as the sun comes up and you sail through the air, are wonderful. The berber breakfast once you land is immense (if the berbers ate as well as we did every day, they would be obese!) and the tour around the farm is really insightful - makes you appreciate all the mod cons we live with.The camel ride is also great fun - and much more comfortable than any camel ride I've taken before!"

I figured I'd do something different, and found this attraction on TripAdvisor. I will not explain the entire course of the day here (as this has been done by other reviewers before me), but rather elaborate on some key aspects of the experience.But first of all - this is really worth every penny.If you have never been in a hot air balloon before - you're in for a treat.On my trip, we were all \"air balloon virgins\". However I would not hesitate to go again.Hamid is the guy who runs the show. He is the manager of the business and the pilot of the air ballon, but maybe most of all a classical entertainer that made the entire morning very enjoyable. He made us all feel safe and sound, from beginning to end.The day started with him picking me up outside my hotel at 6.30 prompt. We then went to get the other passangers, and then the car headed for the desert. This friday morning was a really foggy day. In fact - we drove throught the thickest fog I've ever seen. I honestly thought the ride would be cancelled, but Hamid reassured us that it was okay.We got to the launch site, and had some coffee and pastries while the crew rigged up the balloon. After a while we got into the basket, and were headed up, up and away. After about ten seconds of flight, everything was white around us, and we couldn't see a thing for a while. Then all of a sudden we broke through the layer of clouds. This is honestly the most breathtaking moment of my life. We saw the atlas mountains in the horizon and had the sun in our eyes. I simply couldn't stop smiling. it was insanely beautiful. After we got safely back down, we had a lovely breakfast (with the amazing moroccan mint tea) and the tour of the berber house. The day ended with the camel ride, which was also very nice. It was all over before 1pm, and I had the rest of the day to explore Marrakech.Recommended!"

I have to say, the experience was from beginning to end fantastic. To start with, our pilot Hamid came around and picked everyone up from their individual riads before sunrise. We drove in the 4x4 about 30km out of town, where the crew with the balloon had some coffee, tea and pastries, which we grazed on as daylight broke and they finished assembling the balloon for our flight. From the very beginning it was clear that Hamid is a very smart, engaging, charming, and happy person with a real knack for the 'customer experience' and who is able to inform and entertain a group in multiple languages, in our case English and French.We had a fabulous sunrise, and when we took off I was immediately taken with the completely silent, effortless floating sensation as we drifted above the desert landscape and Hamid told us about the local terrain, the Atlas mountains that were in full relief in the long morning shadows, and the little homes and farms we saw from above. The ride itself was very comfortable and very professional. Hamid was in radio contact the entire time with his crew who tracked us in the 4x4 for the duration of our flight. Our landing was easy and painless, and with characteristic attention to detail, Hamid presented us all with 'flight certificates' and we took pictures. It was a lovely experience, but it was far from finished. Next we drove to a nearby desert home, where we found a full breakfast spread laid out at a table under a traditional tent cover. While we ate Hamid showed us how to put on the local desert headgear, and when we finished we had a tour of the Berber home, where Hamid pointed out all the details of how families live, cook, eat, and deal with the challenges of the environment.We then got back in the 4x4 and drove to our next stop, where we all got to try out a camel ride, which was all good fun as well. We were then taken back to our respective riads, and were shocked to discover it wasn't even one in the afternoon. The experience was one that I will treasure. It was a lovely, calm, peaceful feeling to float quietly toward the Atlas mountains at sunrise, and all the other aspects of our morning were a real treat and a great time all around. The whole thing was well worth the expense in all respects, and I recommend it highly."

You are collected around 6am, driven into the desert, collect the basket and balloon and then drive to the launch site, you get tea, coffee and pastrys whilst watching the guys prepare and inflate the balloon, you also help. You watch the sun rise over the mountains. Then you take off and float/ fly for an hour, wind depending you go 10-30km at various heights, but don\u2019t worry you don\u2019t get airsick or vertigo at all, read the website FAQ\u2019s if you don\u2019t believe me.

Then back to the Palmerie area for a Camel trek \u2013 don\u2019t worry these ones are very well looked after and do not hiss, bite or run off, they are incredibly tame and well looked after, then back to your hotel by 12-1pm."

I would recommend this to everyone who like to see the culture and way of life in Morocco."

The 2 hour quad biking experience was great, our guide led us through up to an amazing viewpoint and then through several Berber villages. Mabruk (who helped us book the experience and came with us on the day) and Omar (our driver) were lovely and they even took us on a mini detour to take some photos on the way back. We loved every minute and are hoping to book another tour through this company when we revisit Marrakech in November."

He went to the trouble of letting me connect to his Internet and then calling the person we're staying with. I cannot thank him enough. All of the people at the shop are wonderful. They even invited us to break fast with them, which made me feel like I could really get involved with the Morrocan culture. The mint tea is beautiful, the best in the medina. We did the tour to Vallee Ourika which was perfect for our short stay in Marrakech as it's only around an hour to drive. We went to a traditional Berber house to have tea and bread and honey. We then went to the place where they make Argon oil and a lovely girl told us all the history in English. It is expected that you tip, so make sure you have some small notes.The lunch down by the river was traditional Morrocan cuisine and was tasty. I paddled in the river which was incredibly refreshing, and the service was good.We then drove to the waterfall, it was stunning. Take a bathing costume because you can swim, although it's so cold. Suitable footwear needed for the rocky terrain, not good for kids or the elderly. It is beautiful. Lovely photo opportunity and great way to cool off after the 20 minute climb in 40 degree heat. Our driver, Abdul was fantastic. Even though it is Ramadan, you wouldn't know. He was informative and friendly. Excellent driver and it was a comfortable car. He also took photos for us with our camera.Overall I really enjoyed it, and it was very reasonably priced compared with the competitors both online and around the medina. Thank you!"

We were a little nervous about going on desert tours with guys we didn't really know so we hesitated to book a 2 or 3 day excursion. After a few days of bumping into them regularly, and drinking lots of Berber tea, we got brave and tried a day tour. We had an excellent day touring the mountains and exploring a berber village and house, eating lunch in a riverside restaurant and visiting a women's cooperative that produces argan oil products. We got a little braver and looked at the photos and itinerary for the longer tours and decided to go. Unfortunately before we could book I got sick, and these guys offered us help and support every day, checking to see how I was and offering advice. We came away with new friends and will definitely be going back to spend some proper time in the desert with them. Thank you Mabrouk, Mohamed and Hossam"

He was friendly, very kind, took very good care of us and entertained all of our requests, however silly there were (like asking to drive us to a cheaper place to eat when we were already seated in a fancy-ish restaurant). 8 days with him was very fun and we were very sad when he had to leave to go back to Marrakech. At first I was a bit reluctant to go on a trip with this tour but it was worth every penny and I highly recommend for anyone who wishes to travel to Morocco to go with this company.

The accommodation that was booked is really good and comfortable with a delicious breakfast everyday. Omar, our tour guide is a friendly and funny tour guide who make us feel like we are travelling with our own family member! Although the trip from one place to another place is quite far and required us to spend a lot of time in the car, we feel relaxed as the tour is flexible and we do not need to rush to follow the itinerary as the itinerary is well prepared by the tours. Besides, we really enjoy the scenery from Atlas Mountain which is covered with snow to the dunes of Sahara Desert as Omar would pull over for us to take picture of the beautiful scenery and he would tell us a bit about the places that we stop. The camel rides and star gazing experience in the Sahara Desert is really enjoyable and beautiful! Hassan also take care of our well being by contacting us once a time to make sure that we get all the things we need. I will recommend this tour to my friends as it is worth the money that we spend with the experience that we got during this trip. Overall, I really enjoyed and glad that I had pick this tour to organize my trip in Morocco."

I am fully satisfied from the very moment we arrived at the Marakkech Airport till the last moment. ( Marakech Airport straight to Casablanca-Rabat(did not sleep there)-Fes-Sahara-Todgha-Marakech)Our guides Hassan and Umar are the best. They brought us to the wonderful places and always being flexible in choosing our destination in each places. They also tend to discuss with us about the destination and always recommend the best.Nabil, our guide in Fes is the best and lovely. He knows every single thing in Fes so dont worry you wouldnt leave that place without knowing nothing and he also helped us a lot shopping there. Instead he was the one who help us to bargain the prices and like i said he knows the best about Fes. So we did get the good prices with a very high quality goods. Next is Sahara Desert. We supposed to arrived there from Fes before sunset but we couldnt make it because it's winter time and sun tend to set faster. It take 7 hours for you to arrive in Sahara from Fes, but we couldnt make it as we stop at few beautiful places otw to sahara. But then we still can ride the camel while watching sunrise as we went to the camp by jeep and went back to the hotel with camel the next day. So it does make your life easier as it is flexible. Todgha Gorges also beautiful. You can get the feel of living at small villages between the big mountain with the sound of river from your room. Brothers at Sahara Desert Camp are wonderful. They welcomed you from the moment where you arrived and guide you to the tent and have dinner a together. If you are same like me, dont worry there is toilet in the desert. They set a bonfire and played their traditional songs i guess. Stragazing at Sahara is the best. It is not a scenery that you can capture with camera.Go and look on your own! Riding camel also one of the best memory :)So if you chose to go with Morahara, Do include Sahara Desert cause our original plan did not include sahara, but we asked to. So basically you can create the tour based on what you like and they will recommend what is the best. So after all, i can say that i am really satisfied with the Morhara Travel and it worth every penny you paid. We were so sad when leaving Morocco and it has been 4 days since we arrived in UK, but we are still missing Morooco. The hotels we stayed also gave the best services.Beautiful country with the kind hearted people, family. #CouscousSisters #SevenSisters"

Nabil (our tour guide in Fes) is the best guide ever!! Really fluent in English, and he knows the history in Fes in and out especially the Old Medina. Really recommended! He bring us to tanneries, potteries, handmade weaving place, University al Qarawiyyin (oldest university in the world), maqaam of well known scholars in Fes and many different shops in the Old Medina. He even brought us to Nejjarine Restaurant in old Medina. The chicken tagine is so delicious! Thank you from 7 sisters from Malaysia to Nabil for the amazing whole day in Fes. An overnight in Sahara desert and camel riding was amazing as well! The campsite was great and very convenient! The food and brothers in the campsite is friendly and great as well. And please take care of us beige cap that I reckon misplaced and left in the campsite Abdul Salam (our tour guide in Marrakesh) is great as well. Always laughing and cheering us. He brings us to all different places with full explanations of history. But sadly due to limited time we haven't had to explore more in Marrakesh. Surely we might need to come back to explore more insyaAllah Hassan and Umar are a very great host! They treat us like fathers. Excellent driving skills with long hours drive especially in the Atlas mountain and throughout the journey from Sahara to Todgha Gorge. All the accommodation is very excellent!! Really convenient and exceed our expectation. Maamoura Hotel in Casablanca, Hotel Blue Sky in Fes, Kenneria Hotel in Marrakesh, Dar Ayour guesthouse in Todgha Gorge. Overall is very amazing! Really recommended!! Thanks Hassan and Umar for a very great journey together with 7 sisters from Malaysia =) #7couscoussisters"

But I honestly do feel that way.We spend 8 days 7 nights in Morocco. Mor'hara organized everything on point. They are super flexible i.e. we wanted to do the \"Cities of Splendor Loving Sultans\" tour and requested for one night in the Sahara desert, Liz took care of it, noooo problem.Hassan and Umar drove the 7 of us around. They are super friendly and really took care of us. We had Nabil as our guide in Fes (Awesome guy) and Abdul Salam in Marrakech. The accomodations in every city, as well as in Sahara, are better that I expected.The downsides: We didn't get to go to some of the places stated in the itinerary, especially in Marrakech. And one time in Fes they took us to an expensive restaurant for dinner. So I think you better tell the guides before hand, what are your price range for food.But other than that, everything was just amazing. The trip went smoothly and surprisingly quick. 8 days are not enough for me. I wish I could stay longer :( Will deffo come again soon. Mor'hara FTW!"

I started to email Liz and she patiently replying my emails. countless emails i guess. Liz, you are so nice :)We arrived at Marrakesh Menara Airport and met Hassan and Umar. they brought us to seafood restaurants for lunch. they made us decide where we would like to eat. Hassan too very patiently be with us throughout the 7 days. cheering our days with his sense of humor. As we are Muslims, it is a very convenient trip whereby they stopped us when it was pray time. very helpful. excellent hotels and unforgettable memories with Hassan, Umar, Nabil-our tour guide in Fez which for me was the best tour guide ever, Abdul Salam-keep laughing with us throughout the day in Marrakesh, and all Morroccan people who always make du'as and welcoming us along the journey.have never thought to become overly attached with Hassan, Umar and all Morroccans. Hassan and Umar were like our fathers who take care all 7 of us. oh not to forget, their skills in driving the car all the day. more than 5 hours driving. the Sahara's friendly people, Todgha, Dades Valley and every single moment would last forever in my memory. couldn't ask for more. Mor'hara is the best *Thumbs up*. May God bless Mor'hara"

I call myself lucky that friends introduced me to his little shop and agency in the busy road of Riad Zitoun Jdide where genuine hospitality, a friendly hi and \"hello, how was your day\" welcomed me whenever I passed by. Patiently Idriss explained to me all the different tours they offer as well the meaning and traditions of the diverse beautiful stuff exhibited inside. I decided just for a short day trip upon his recommendation to the valley of Ourika and the waterfall in a small group. Well organized I was picked up without delay with a few other people - which turned out to become a lovely group. On the way the driver was always ready for a short stop to take a few shots to inhale the breath taking beauty of the mountain side in autumn in its golden colors. We stopped for good in Si Fatme where a local guide led us up to the waterfalls, always kindly supportive and patient for taking a view around, taking photos or just absorbing the beauty of this landscape - there are many photos on google images giving an idea about it, but the air, the breeze, the colors, the pure nature is much more beautiful than one might guess. I felt very grateful for this advise of this day trip!!! The lunch, taken at the river side was delicious and the tour back was very calm as everyone had to cope with the flood of impressions and the ravishingly beautiful landscape just before sunset. I felt very encouraged to go for more tours, but as my holidays had come to an end I can only count for the day to return and do more tours organised by Mor'hara. Marrakesh by itself is enchanting - but these day trips or tours are opening doors to a different quality of Morocco!! I'll be back soon!!"

My boyfriend and I were staying in Marrakech for a few days and by chance came cross the Mor'hara Tours shop when walking through the Souks on our first day. We are from Scotland and we were astounded to learn the company's Scottish connections, it was definitely fate! They were so friendly and welcoming and invited us to join them for a lovely mint tea in their little shop. There are many different tour options from day tours to the coast or longer tours to the Sahara. As we only had a couple of days we decided on a day trip to Essaouira as we fancied a visit to the beach.The team were so flexible and helpful, as Hassan offered to meet us at our Riad in the morning so he could take us round to his jeep. We had a fantastic day at the coast and stopped along the way to visit the goats in the trees, an argan oil co-operative and we also paid a visit to the village where Jimi Hendrix lived in 1969.Lunch was absolutely fabulous. We told Hassan we loved fish so he took us to the port to pick up some fresh fish, and some bread and salad from the markets. The food was then cooked and served to us on a roof terrace with mint tea and fresh fruit. Delicious! Hassan is a very good driver and we felt very safe with him, especially when arriving back in Marrakech during rush hour (that was an experience in itself!).The guys are so hospitable and I cannot recommend them enough. We met and had tea with them a few more times before our departure a few days ago. As Mubarak said, it is a small shop with a big heart. When we come back to Marrakech we will definitely be doing the Sahara tour!"

My trip with Hassan was from Marrakech to Zagora and out to the desert. His English is good, his driving is excellent and his care factor to ensure that the client has an enjoyable time is his priority. The overnight desert trip was simply amazing. Sleeping outside under the stars and waking to the eerie silence of a rose-colored vision of endless sand was a breath taking experience. I would definitely recommend Mo'hara Morocco Tours to anyone contemplating a tour of any type, as they will tailor a tour to suit your budget and your taste, promptly and efficiently. And, friendly Hassan will definitely look after you and share his cultural heritage."

Luckily for us, the company we had originally booked our transfers and excursions with had let us down and we then found Saha Tours. We had originally booked a shared 3 day desert excursion, but when the original company let us down and we had to find an alternative, we decided to upgrade to a private 3 day desert excursion with superior accommodation. Luckily during my research I came across Youssef of Saha Tours. He answered all emails promptly and in clear detail. We had to pay a deposit for the tour through Western Union which I was a little concerned with as had never experienced them before. I made the transaction online and it all went smoothly. The desert trip was a fantastic experience and enjoyed the company of driver/guide Mahjoub, so also ended up booking a trip to Ouzoud Waterfalls with him for the following week.3 day Desert tripOn the morning of our trip we were met at our hotel by Mahjoub. Our vehicle was a comfortable 4 x 4 with air con. Mahjoub is a lovely guy with very good English and gave so much information on our journey. There is a lot of driving involved in this excursion. If we needed a break, Mahjoub would always find us somewhere to stop and somewhere that had good clean toilets! He would stop wherever there was a good photo opportunity and at times became our own personal photographer, so we have plenty of pictures of the two of us together (plus some selfies with Mahjoub also!). My husband has prescription sunglasses, and unfortunately the night before the trip lost a screw from them, so lense had popped out. We explained this to Mahjoub, so whenever we went through a town he would drive slowly to keep an eye open for an Optician and also stop and ask for help. Unfortunately due to Ramadan, most places were shut. He even took a screw from his own spare sunglasses to see if it would fit, but it did not. He offered my husband his spare sunglasses to borrow, but luckily the next day we were able to find an optician which was open and quickly fixed them for us. The standouts for our first day was the driver over the Atlas Mountains, and Ait Ben Haddou. We stopped at a small hotel opposite Ait Ben Haddou for lunch and had a set 3 course meal for an extremely reasonable price. Am so glad we did Ait Ben Haddou before lunch as would have struggled afterwards as we were so full!For our first night we stayed at XALUCA DADES. We absolutely loved this hotel. It was decorated throughout in an African theme. The only issue we had is that because we had left our hotel in Marrakech and were returning to it after our desert trip, we had left our passports locked safely in our room safe. We were unaware that this hotel would need our passport details, so had to obtain them from our hotel in Marrakech. Had we not been able to get these details, I am not sure we would actually have been allowed to stay there as it seemed a very big deal! Our evening meal was included at this hotel and also breakfast, both buffet style.Day 2 and Mahjoub collected us at 9.00 for our journey towards the desert. We travelled through Dades Valley and Todra Gorge. I believe we arrived at Merzouga around 6pm. Mahjoub left us with our \u201ccamel boy\u201d and we started our 50 minute trek to our desert camp (AMANAR). We were met by a guy called Youssef who provided tea and snacks. There were 8 tents at this camp, and we were a little disconcerted to find we were to be the only guests staying there. Unfortunately Youssef didn\u2019t speak much English and we couldn\u2019t speak his languages! After our tea he asked if we would like to see our tent. It had a lovely comfortable double bed, plus a single bed, shower and most importantly our own toilet! We went outside to take photos from the dunes keeping an eye on the dining tent. When dinner was ready Youssef gestured us to come over and that\u2019s where our feast began. The food was absolutely gorgeous......and so much of it! After eating we retired to our tent. Had there been other guests, there would have been singing, so was a little disappointed as this would have added to the atmosphere.... this wouldn\u2019t have been able to take place outside though as unfortunately was very windy so sand was blowing everywhere. Day 3We were up for sunrise so we could take photos. We had breakfast and were on our way again for the return 50 minute camel journey for 6 a.m. Mahjoub was waiting for us to being our long journey back.....and long journey it was, with not so much impressive scenery on the way back. Thank goodness for good company, comfortable car and air conditioning!I could have written so much more, but will leave it here. Thanks to all at Saha tours for enabling us to experience such a unique 3 days that we will never forget. Ouzoud WaterfallsThis was an almost 3 hour journey from our hotel in Marrakech, but so worth it and good to meet with Mahjoub again. When we arrived, we decided to pay a local guide to show us the waterfalls and were glad we made this decision. It was worth the 150 dirhams he requested (for both of us, not per person). We arrived around 10.45 and were with him for 3 \u2013 3.30 hours. This place is absolutely beautiful. What I also loved other than the beauty of the falls was seeing the wild monkeys.....so nice to see monkeys that are not behind bars. We were shown to a restaurant directly in front of the waterfalls where we could eat whilst having the best possible views. We were also joined by one of the monkeys who stole some of our bread before being chased off by staff. Am so glad we did the private tour, as reading reviews on the shared tours, you only get around 2 hours there before being whisked off to eat somewhere else on the way home.....why would you want to do that when you can eat directly in front of the waterfall and relax? You are able to swim here but we chose not to. Totally recommend this tour, loved every minute."

He explained the itinerary for the day and began telling us facts about the important places we drove past, such as the city walls of Marrakech and the Koutoubia Mosque. Our first stop was in the High Atlas Mountains where we had coffee on a terrace overlooking an amazing view of the mountains. Next, we stopped to see how almond butter is produced and we bought some cosmetic creams made of argon oil. We had lunch in a little village and then had a private tour of Ait Benhaddou, which dates back to the 11th century. Various films were filmed in this location, the most notable ones being Gladiator and Indiana Jones. We went to the top of Ait Benhaddou and captured some amazing photos of the desert and mountains. After that, we went to take pictures outside the film studio where movies are filmed. We continued our way towards Zagora through the Anti Atlas Mountains for more breathtaking photo opportunities. Along the way is also a Palm grove that we stopped at to take pictures of the sea of Palm trees that seems to never end. Before we arrived at the drop off location to mount the camels, Majoub asked if we would like to buy scarves for the desert. We said yes and he made sure that the merchant did not over charge us. The merchant originally said 100dh per scarf, but Majoub talked him down to 30dh each. When we arrived where the camels were waiting for us, Majoub said we could leave anything in the car that we did not need for the camel ride. We mounted the camel and trekked further into the desert and watched the sunset. We arrived at the Berber camp and we were greeted with mint tea and wafers. We went during Ramadan, which was so amazing to experience as cultural learning opportunity. Majoub had not eaten or drank anything all day, so before he met with us again, he had dinner. We finally met again and he allowed us to get any clothes or bags from his vehicle to take into our tent. Around 8pm, dinner was served by the camp workers. It consisted of bread, salad, tajine, and followed by fruit. After dinner the camp workers set a fire pit and played music. My partner and I stayed a little off to the side and just stared up the stars and listened to the drums and singing. There was another group of six people at the campsite, so it was a little overwhelming since they had took over the fire pit area and there were not enough seats. Either way, we still had an amazing night starring at the stars and taking it all in. We went to bed around 1am. We slept with the door of the tent open because it was still uncomfortably hot even at night. The toilets and showers were very nice. I was a little disappointed with how nice it was actually. I thought we'd have more of an authentic experience, but for those who don't really like the outdoors, this is perfect for you! The next morning, drums woke us for the sun rise. After the sunrise, breakfast was served. It was a simply breakfast of bread and croissants, with coffee and orange juice. We decided not to ride the camels back, so we got in the car and started our journey back to Marrakech. We didn't stop often since it was the same route from the day before. We eventually stopped for lunch at the same place we bought argon oils, so if you want to buy more, this is your opportunity. Majoub dropped us off at the train station in Marrakech since we were going off to Casablanca. First class tickets for the train are only 150dh/person to Casablanca and can be purchased at the station. All in all, we had a wonderful time. Majoub was an amazing tour guide and he is a great person in generally and really cares about the happiness of his clients. Tips for travelers: Bring extra cash with you. The economy in the desert heavily relies on tourism. You will find that the places you stop to take pictures are coincidentally places that locals have set up shop to sell souvenirs. You have friends and family at home that would love a little something from Morocco, so help out the locals and buy a little something each place you stop. Also, make sure you have enough money to tip your tour guides and anyone who serves you. The tour at Ait Benhaddou is free, but we tipped the guide for his time. Again, tourism is what drives their economy. We also made sure to tip the workers at the camp. One more tip, as amazing as it was to travel alone with just my partner, we discussed how much more fun it would be with a close group of friends. The other group of six at the camp site seemed to have an amazing time, but they were there for themselves and didn't seem to want to interact with us even when we tried to interact with them. It made it a bit awkward, like we were invading their vacation. So I would highly recommend to make this a group trip so that you can fully have fun and let loose when the drums and music begins around the fire. Thank you again for an unforgettable vacation!"

Booking was very easy and Youssef was very responsive to all of my emails prior to arrival. Majoub was our guide and was very nice and knowledgeable. It is a very long drive to Zagora from Marrakech. Majoub stopped many times to take pictures as well as at Ait Benhaddou and gave us a tour. We were very jet lagged during our drive and Majoub would make sure we were up for important sights. The camel ride and overnight stay in the Zagora dessert is something that I will never forget. The guides in the dessert were so nice and welcoming. We were greeted upon arrival at the camp by Rasheed with mint tea, crackers and cookies. The campsite is very lovely with beds, showers and toilets. Dinner was wonderful and the evening was capped by songs and dance around a campfire. The guides with Saha tours are truly wonderful people and made us feel incredibly welcome during our short time with them. I'd highly recommend using this tour group. Be aware that this trip includes a lot of drive time (about 6 hours each day) but it will be something you will never forget. Thank you Majoub!"

A fantastic tour, brilliant tour guides, different and intimate and not constrained by other tourists.From the beginning, the communication from Youssef was outstanding and reassuring. It was his prompt and professional interaction with us that meant we chose his service for our honeymoon tour from Marrakesh to the Sahara Desert and back over three days. We were slightly worried about the Western Union transfer of deposit but this worry proved unnecessary.Rachyd and Zyed (Sp*) collected us from our Riad in Marrakech and the adventure started! Rachyd was so knowledgable about the history of Morocco, the politics of the background stories that he spoke about were an interesting and insightful introduction for a novice throughout the journey.The first two days of driving out to the Sahara were interesting and conducted in short bursts, interspersed with coffee stops, photo panoramic opportunities and old settlements. We went out in search for nomads, history and culture, sometimes off the beaten track and we weren't disappointed. The night in the Sahara was enchanting and special. Camel riding into the dunes to watch the sunset was magical. We shared the camp with only one other couple who we had a traditional sing song with before bed. We chose to upgrade to superior accommodation. Private plumbing and showers in the tents were an absolute treat - unbelievable in the middle of the desert!! The service during the meals was fantastic and Rachyd's personal touches were heartfelt and beautiful - a honeymoon cake at the end of what can only be described as a feast was almost too much, but an extremely kind, personal touch.The return drive was a bit of a slog - about 12 hours. However, we went a different route back, with different anecdotes, sights and stories to keep us interested (when we weren't sleeping) and a traditional Berber lunch was a fantastic experience made possible by Rachyd and Zyed.A massive thank you for making our honeymoon trip extra special and interesting!"

We booked the standard four day tour including an airport pick up, drop off to Riad (which I had booked separately on my own) and then a four day tour starting on day two of our trip. We did the usual trip as below which is the standard route everyone uses:MARRAKECH (Pick Up at airport)MARRAKECH-HIGH ATLAS-TICKA (2260m)-OUARZAZATE-SKOURA SKOURA-VALLEY OF ROSES \u2013 DADES VALLEYDADES VALLEY-TODRA GORGES-ERFOUD-MERZOUGA-CAMEL RIDE-NIGHT IN A BERBER CAMPMERZOUGA\u2013RISSANI-ALNIF-NKOB- DRAA VALLEY \u2013 OUARZAZATE OUARZAZATE- AIT BEN HADDOU \u2013 MARRAKECHThe only thing I would miss out would be Ait Ben Haddou. It great to take photo, but we did not go to the studios sine it is of no interest to us. The driver Ali and Hmad our guide were knowledgeable, trustworthy, funny, smart and not in your face or pushy. We did stop at a few shops but we had a choice so if we did not want anything we could have left. It was nice and Hmad also helped us get a good price as best as you will get unless you are with locals or family. The 4x4 car was always clean, comfortable and we had an option for AC but we chose not to have it on. We learnt a lot of the culture, local practices, tribes, nomads, Berbers, Arabs, languages etc although I am no good at speaking. We loved the music, the quiet stretches when you just want to immerse yourself in the view and the local life / villages etc. we could stop anytime but I chose to take photos while moving, and they look great. Especially the local village life. We are both vegetarian and we had no problems eating at any of the places we stopped at lunch or overnight. The hotels were good quality and we felt safe all the time. The desert experience and overnight in a luxury camp was our highlight. We had the best food their and the camels were the cutest. Everything was working and we had a nice shower in the tent. All our stops overnight were clean and good quality. For us the gorges, the Tichka pass, the Draa valley, rissani market, were good places we would want to stay longer at these places especially the gorges. Everything was good timed and professional, friendly, practical, reliable, trustworthy and easy going. Thank you for making our trip comfortable and lovely. "

Prices were very reasonable and worked the whole schedule around our needs. He was also the most responsive out of all the tours we contacted. Right before we arrived. He gave us the names of our guide, Mahjoul, and driver, Hassan, and said they will be meeting us for pick up at the airport. When we arrived, they were right there and made sure we had all that we needed before we made the long trip through High Atlas and eventually Merzouga. Along the way, Mahjoul was very informative and stopped at any number of stops and requests we made. I think he got us to take more amazing panoramic views than we ever would try to. The meals we had were delicious and what I loved was that he always took us to the cleanest possible bathrooms, no matter where we were. Our driver Hassan was also amazing. Even though he didn't speak a lot, his gestures and reactions to events made us laugh all throughout our trip. The ride there and back was very comfortable. We upgraded to the superior accommodations and did not regret it one bit. Even our camps were amazing. It far exceeded our expectation of what it meant to \"camp\" in the desert. We ended up getting rained on, and aside from being cold on that one night, it didn't impact our trip at all.Thank You Saha Tours!"

Other couples that we have met during the trip who were travelling alone, told us that they had bad/ uncomfortable situations with kids, police, people begging for money, Moroccan drive style, etc but we have a smooth and nice trip with a very genuine true Berber called Ali.

Also when we asked him not to bring us to one of these standard tourist food places to eat an overpriced lunch, he dropped us at a place only with locals where we were the only tourists. We felt also safe with our driver Ali who had to cope with flooded roads (he literally had to drive through a river) and snow in the Atlas (which seemed to be something very rare).We also very much enjoyed the stay and the dinner in our first hotel (superior accomodation category) which was very cute and designed with a lot attention to Detail. A great experience! However, the difference between standard and superior category wasn't clear to us on the second night when we stayed in the tent in the desert. Unfortunately, we were quite unfortunate with the weather in the Sahara, there was a sandstorm going on and that made the camel ride and stay in the tent ...Let's call it an adventure ;-) But well, nobody can help that and all the staff on any place was always helpful, professional and friendly. I definitely recommend Saha Tours for this experience!"

Though we were off-road most of time, we felt comfortable and safe as we knew Zaid and Mahjoub are experienced and familiar with these areas. We enjoyed their company so much.

This wasn't extreme biking because we had beginners in the group and they make sure they can cope. Would suggest you book a private group of you want something more adventurous. But it's still enjoyable riding across the desert and up and down the hills. The lake is really just the scenery at the end when you have tea and crepes. Definitely recommend"

The route chosen is not too challenging but has a mix of road, tick and sand. The stop in the Burber village is a welcome break I got the impression the house we visited was where the chap who led our party lived. Sitting in the shade drinking traditional tea and nibbling on a Moroccan freshly made flat bread was awesome. If you are going in the summer wear sleeves trust me is over 40 degrees and there is NO shade, don't wear shirts either as your legs will cook. Your left leg will cook from both the sun and the heat from the quads engine. Go in the morning it's just too hot to quad in the afternoon."

My other half and I booked our half-day trip at Lake Takerkoust with Maroc Quad Passion via Whatsapp, with them confirming pick up time for our half day trip the evening before departure. They collected us as the hotel on time and transported us to their base in the desert outside Marrakech in a very comfortable, air conditioned van.The trip itself was wonderful. After testing everyone's skills, they split the group of 12 into 3 groups of 4 riders. This was great as our group wasn't slowed down by some of the more nervous riders or kids, which can so often be the case. The quadding itself was amazing, at times like driving across the moon! The scenery was unbelievable, and there was opportunity to stop for photos (although there could have been more of these for the view of the lake). Nonetheless, a solid 2 hours of quadding at a reasonable price, and with great guides.There was a nice post-quad meal of moroccan pancakes and mint tea, though this was a little rushed. It was very pleasant though, and the view spectacular. There were a few attempts to sell some other trips, like jet-skiing and such, but a polite no was sufficient.I can't recommend this trip enough!"

Our guide was very good to point out the more risky areas along the way and warning us to slow down.

This meant we were able to drive at our own speed and wasn't in a long train limiting us when on the trail. We stopped at the top of a mini mountain and were able to take pics and ride a donkey before taking off again on our journey. The track was very rocky terrain and we were driving for a long period of time . We stopped off again at what looked like a traditional Beber village to have some mint tea before heading back to our pick up point. After the ride we were air hosed to get all the dust off and dropped back to our Riad.Overall a great experience and I would recommend the only negative would be that they could've given us gloves as it was very chilly to begin with in the morning."

They accomodated our group size (8) and allowed younger members to ride along as a passenger. Get to drive through the country side and stop for mint tea after an hour of driving. Only criticisms would be that first impressions are not great...the website shows sand dunes and you get a gravelly, rocky bit of land with lots of rubbish. But this is only the practice area and you are soon on your way through the countryside. My only other point of contention is that once you get used to the driving its a bit boring. They don't allow you to speed up or kearn any fancy moves! The driving is flat road and a bit monotonous."

A 16 year old son who wants quad biking but a wife and daughter who only want to ride camels \u2013 not a problem for Maroc Quad Passion and after a couple of emails with Youssef we were all set. First it was pick-up from the hotel and a short drive to the quad centre. After a safety briefing and helmet fitting followed by some simple familiarising and steering we were off. There we only 8 in the group but we immediately split into two groups of 4 so there was no riding at the back of a long train. Our guide took us quite some distance but mainly on tracks and trails so we were never bothered by any road traffic and we felt safe and secure throughout. There was the opportunity of a couple of stops for some photos and a chat plus a visit to a rural homestead for the ubiquitous mint tea but also some delicious Moroccan pancakes. The two hours went so quick and we were soon being dusted off with an air hose before meeting up with my wife and daughter who\u2019d been separately collected from the hotel. It was then a brief drive to the palm grove to put on some more traditional head gear for the camel ride. No controls to learn this time but like our guide the camels were all very friendly and we spent a brilliant hour or so with a leisurely and surprisingly comfortable stroll in the sun. I can\u2019t recommend the whole experience highly enough and we\u2019ve been left with lots of great memories to recall and reminisce now we\u2019re back home plus my son wants to know when we can do the full 5-day quad safari!"

We got picked up from our hotel in a nice car and driven to the palmerie desert (Around 45 minutes) where we were instructed how to use the quad bikes - very easy to use. We then quad biked in a loose convoy at quite high speeds throughout the 3 hour trip into the desert which had magnificent views. We stopped at a village for a traditional tea break and provided with water. Our guides and the people with us were friendly and helpful. Thanks to Youssef and all the team for making this trip memorable. Would consider a full-day excursion next time!"

When you stop to have mint tea the people are so hospitable and friendly and give you endless amounts of bottled water and top up your tea glasses. You definitely get your money's worth as you're you on the quad bikes for over 3 hours and yet you do not get bored as the different landscapes and terrains are always exciting. Whether you're driving the quad bike yourself or on the back of the instructors it is just as exciting and this experience will create a memory of a lifetime! You can easily book and arrange timing with Youssef through whatsapp which is very convenient. Would recommend this to anyone!"

I have never written a review before but this was one of the best things my girlfriend and I did in Marrakech. 70 euros to share a quad (or 50 for your own) and we were picked up by Youssef from our Riad. We drove to the outskirts of Marrakech and had a good guide and basically went for an awesome 2 hour quad drive through the landscape. Some great picture opportunities and even stopped off for some Peppermint tea in a Berber village.Well worth the money and Youssef is a top bloke. If you are tight for time in Marrakech like we were or if you have lots of time, either way this is a must do activity."

Very punctual and precise with timing. The driver was also very friendly and made us feel comfortable and communicated with us throughout the journey.

We were given a quick and detailed introduction on how to use the quads and what activities will be covered through out the day. Very well spoken English therefore had no communication difficulties. The quad bikes worked efficiently and were very easy and safe to ride. The employees within Marrakech Quad Evasion were full of spirit and were excellent as guides as we had the opportunity to take pictures with the quads and have a drink break. Half way through the quad journey, we were taken to a beautiful village were drinks and traditional mint tea was provided. Youssef is a amazing, friendly man who is full of spirit and really nice to talk to. He is down to earth and his employees are 100% genuine and awesome people.

After getting kitted up and a quick intro to the quads, we headed of into the spectacular surrounds, passing farms and village along the way.

            "review": "Outstanding experience. My husband and I booked a 4 days trip from F\u00e8s to Marrakech with rough tours. On the first day our driver and guide Driss picked us up at our hostel in F\u00e8s (throughout the trip Driss was always more than punctual). On that day we drove all the way to Merzouga. We stopped on a lot of interesting places on our way and Driss had a lot of knowledge about all of them. We spent the first night in a guest house in Merzouga.In the second day we stayed in the Merzouga area where we saw for examples the gardens of people living in Merzouga, drove across the dunes, had tea in a berber tent, went to Nomads' places and ate a Berber pizza (very good). I would recommend to not only stay one night in the desert, but to stay another night, you'll get to see so much more. Later that day we returned to another hostel from where the camel ride to the desert camp started. Note that rough tours owns its own camp in the desert (operated by local hotel staff) where only rough tours guests stay (we were six people altogether that night). From what I heard from other people this is probably the most comfortable camp in the dunes. We had proper bathroom facilities there and even electric light in the tents. The next day we woke up at 7 a.m. to see the sun rise over the dunes (outstanding experience and a must when you are in Morocco) and had a camel ride back to the hostel where we could use the showers and had a breakfast (we got a small room for ourselves during that night where we could store our stuff that we didn't need in the desert). We drove in direction of our next hotel (a 4*-hotel in the Dad\u00e8s valley). Again, stopped at several spots along the way (such as Todra gorge).On the last day (the way to Marrakech) we went to see the film studios of Ouarzazate (lots of famous movies were shot here) and to the Kasbah of Ait Ben Haddou which is also a set for many popular movies such as 'Gladiator' and series like Game of Throns (the reason my husband and I desperately wanted to go there). In Marrakech Driss dropped us at our hotel.There might be cheaper ways to get to all these destinations than with rough tours, but keep in mind that Rough Tours offers a lot more than simply a car and a driver. Driss, for example, speaks fluent English (he studied English at the university of Meknes) and is very knowledgable about Morocco in general and the desert in area in specific (he himself is originally from that area, we even had the chance to stop at his house and had a tea with his mother ;) ). He made clear from the start that we could ask him any questions and so we did not only learn a lot about Morocco, but also could ask him quite some personal stuff. Therefore, I really had the impression I got a good idea about people's life in Morocco. In addition to that Driss was a very safe driver, the car pretty comfortable and in a good condition and all the accomodations were of a very high standard (higher standard than what we normally book and what we booked when we were in Morocco on our own, maybe this is negotiable if you want to safe some money).To sum it up, I really recommend to book a Rough Tours, you won't regret."

We felt safe all the time in the Toyota Land Cruiser with our driver and Rachyd and we were never forced to buy anything we did not feel comfortable with. Rachyd is also into photography and he took some memorable pics of us along the way. It was my 30th anniversary and they managed to organize a cake for me in the middle of the desert!

The country, the people, the culture and Rough Tours exceeded my expectations! My friend and I have been travelling together for the last 10years or so, neither of us had the time to plan the trip so we decided to try a tour. We looked at other tour groups, but Rough Tours really stood out to us, for the quick responses to our emails, including everything we wanted to see and more, very detailed itinerary, websites of the lodging and the price of the tour. Youseff, manager, was very quick to answer all of our emails, questions and concerns. We found that they were cheaper than the bigger tour groups, and we liked the idea of the trip being about what we wanted to see and do, rather than a set itinerary that waited on 10-20 or more travelers. It seemed more personal with the 2 of us and our guide/driver. We did a 14 day tour with Driss, our guide/driver. First of all, I am most impressed by how punctual Driss was throughout our trip, always 15 minutes early. (We've travelled a lot, and its very rare to have someone early). Driss, was fantastic, friendly, funny, knowledgeable and an overall great guy. We spent 2 weeks with him, so I feel like I left the tour having a new friend. We spent a lot of time in the car, by the way the car was a Toyota land cruiser, so we were very comfortable and Driss is a very good driver. I felt very safe even through the Tizi n tichka pass, you'll know what I mean when you do a tour with RT. Like I said we did spend a lot of time in the car, but it was one of the most beautiful and scenic drives, my favorite was the drive from Fes to Merzouga, the landscape always changing. During our long drives Driss was great at explaining Moroccan culture, what its like to be a nomad, the difference between Berber and Arabic people and telling us all about the history of different sites and villages. There was a big holiday during our tour and Driss was telling us the importance of Eid Al Adha., the day families get together to celebrate \" The Feast\"! We also listened to each others music, which I really enjoyed. I felt like I learned so much from him and his country. It was a very eye opening experience, Morocco completely exceeded my expectations, and I don't think we would have been able to have such an experience had we done it on our own or on one of the big tour groups. The riads and hotels we stayed at were very nice, my favorite was in Chefchaouen and Xaluca in Merzouga. If you have the time, to spend in Morocco please do more than a 3 day tour. There is so much to see and its all amazing and please do it with Rough Tours. I had Driss as a guide and he was so much fun to be around, but the other guides that I met along the tour were just as friendly and fun to be around, so you can't go wrong.Driss, Youseff, Mohammad and the rest of the guides thank you so much for the amazing experience! I hope to see you all again! Inchalah!!"

A small group were looking for a 3-day tour starting and ending in Marrakech that took us through the Atlas Mountains and into the Sahara.Rough Tours were very helpful - adapting a tour from Marrakech-Fez to suit our requirements, and were very communicative via email as we agreed dates/pickups etc. Once in Morocco, our tour guide and driver (Ahmed and Mohammed) picked us up from our Marrakech Riad as arranged. They were good-humoured and great company, informative and very helpful throughout the journey. The guides were keen show and explain the history, culture and geography of the places we were travelling through.As part of the package, Rough Tours included a stay in a hotel (the four-star Hotel Xaluca Dades) for the first night, and a camel trek to a Berber camp for the second night. All the bookings were in high-quality accommodation, included dinner/breakfast, and were all arranged seamlessly. On the last day they dropped us back in Marrakech. They even phoned ahead to the owner of our Riad on our behalf to ensure he was there to meet us when we arrived in the city.At the end of the tour we felt we'd had a genuine experienced of the country, with guides whose knowledge and help made for an unforgettable trip! Our itinerary included:Day 1 : MarrakeshTizi-n-Tishka (High Atlas Mountains) Ait Ben Haddou (UNESCO World Heritage Site) Ourzazate Valley of the RosesBoumalene du Dades (where we spent the night)Day 2 : TinghirTodra Gorge Tinjdad Rissani Merzouga (to start our camel trek). Night in Berber CampDay 3 : MerzougaOuarzazate MarrakechMany thanks Rough Tours!Philip & John"

Our guide picked us up from our Riad and we had a private tour throughout the 3 days. Our guide was friendly, extremely helpful and very knowledgeable and passionate about the Moroccan and Berber culture. Not only we went to stunning breathtaking places but we also learnt a lot about their culture and the fascinating life in the desert. The food and accommodation provided surpassed our expectation and we felt safe throughout the journey. I just had a little accident in the dunes and hurt my knee when sand boarding. On the first opportunity our guide took me to the doctor in a village near by and the company covered all the expenses. It was a marvellous and unforgettable experience in many ways. We enjoyed every minute of it and had a good laugh with our guide who was also a very funny character. Thank you Rough Tours and all the lovely Berber people who crossed our way for this fantastic experience! Wish you all the best!"

As I write this, my bum is still a bit sore from the camel ride and our memories of three days of learning and laughing with Hassan and Ibrahim are fresh. They took good care of us while accommodating our eccentric curiosity. Like me, Hassan's a history buff. Pretty much every company follows the same itinerary; for us, the RoughTours difference was Hassan's thoughtful commentary and his readiness to trade ideas in an open-minded way. Though the long drive sometimes grew tiresome, our conversation never flagged. From Fes to Marrakesh, the teamwork between Hassan and driver Ibrahim was flawless. Ibrahim's an expert and careful driver, and low-key funny. I could write lots more, repeating the praises heaped on RoughTours by other guests, but it's enough to observe here that the reviews here show that hundreds of others, almost without exception, have also had a great experience with this company."

We also booked them to drive us from Fes back to the Casablanca airport. Everything went exactly as planned, they were always on time and were super friendly. Also extremely responsive to all my emails during the planning stages - usually within the hour! I would highly recommend booking with Rough Tours over the bus tours. We saw several of those buses onloading and offloading during our tour and those guys looked miserable while we had our own private SUV. I really can't say enough good things about these guys!"

I took my family of 5 to Morocco this last summer (2016) and we had a 5 day tour with RT booked based on the recommendation of a friend. Of our entire 5 week trip to Spain, our 5 days in Morocco was everyone's favorite without exception. Our guides, Mohammed and Hassan quickly became like family to us. My kids, (7, 10 and 14) were equally charmed by both men as they took the time to get to know our kids, joke with them and fully include them in every aspect of the trip. My kids still talk about them both. They were patient, extremely knowledgeable and funny. We saw SO much of Morocco in such a short time. Of all the places I have visited in the world, Morocco completely stole my heart. I definitely want to go back and see, learn and do more. Our trip included Tangier, Fez, Chefchaouen, Atlas Mountains, Sahara Desert, Marrakech to name only a few. I could have spent a full additional week, for sure. The food was amazing virtually every place we went, the people were welcoming and kind and the history was rich and inspiring. If you are going to Spain, do yourself a favor and take the trip over to Morocco. Or just go to Morocco alone! It will not disappoint. And if you do, book a trip with no one other than Rough Tours. They don't have the almost perfect rating for nothing. It was an epic adventure that will always be a favorite for our family. And ask for Mohammed and Hassan!! (Between the two of them they speak at least 5 languages so they will almost definitely speak one of yours). TIP: We went in July and it was bloody hot riding camels in the desert. Because it was such an amazing experience we almost didn't notice the heat, for real, but maybe another month would be more comfortable. :)"

My tour guide, Igout Ahmed was so great. He's communicative and gave me lots of informations regarding Morroco. He also bought an amazing Berber Pizza for me (which was so so so great).

From the planning up to the end of our trip, we had an excellent service and the tour was according to the schedule, informed by Youssef. Our trip started in Marrakesh, heading towards Merzouga, with a night stand in the desert and then we followed towards Fes, finishing our tour there. Our guide, Mohammed, was very friendly, gentle and very careful with us. In fact, after the first day I felt like an old friend of him. Mohammed did not push us to shops or sellers, which is something that really bothers me in some guides/companies. We felt very safe, had excellent accommodation, and transport (very comfortable/clean). We had an excellent guide, visited wonderful places, ate good food and had the opportunity to learn about local people and their customs/culture in a very pleasant way. It was a fantastic tour! All revisions we had read on trip advisor praising RoughTours team really do justice to the amazing treatment and tour we had! Wish I could come back soon to Marocco during winter and take another tour with RoughTours team."

Mohammed went out of his way to call for someone to meet us and then again an hour after our arrival to make sure it all worked out.

I've been on many short tours, in many countries, I spent twelve years living in Arabia and have crossed deserts and mountains. So, I had limited expectations for this not-far-off-the-main-road trip from Marrakesh. I had chosen Rough Tours in part because it supports education for Berber children, in part because Youssef -- Director of the family-owned business had sounded so committed and helpful when I rang the company, also stating that the company makes a point of ensuring that no one is pressured to buy any type of souvenir whilst on the tour. In fact, Youssef made the whole trip a joy from start to finish. As our driver and guide, he made us feel totally safe and looked after at all times. We went to heritage sites, and an eco-lodge, shared information about the fantastic rock formations (my travel companion was a geologist), ate good food, shared great conversatiobn and a lot of good humour. Our night out in a Berber camp, after a short camel-ride, was geared for tourists but good fun and had the luxury of a real bed and clean showers. All in all, we were sorry to get back to the bustle of town and to say goodbye (almost) to Youssef. In fact, we met again as, next day, Youssef kindly came to collect us from our hotel and take us to the airport. I recommend Rough Tours most highly -- and I can't wait to go back for a longer tour myself. We will aim to go \"en famille\" next time -- with the little ones as well -- and spend more time in the \"authentic\" desert!"

Morocco is not the easiest place for solo female traveller, and traveling through Sahara from Fes back to Marrakech seems even more adventurous. I am glad I picked Rough Tour coz from the very beginning, Youssef responded very quickly, and details of the itinerary were laid out clearly. I was not doing much research with the trip, so i don't know what to expect. But when i showed the experienced riad owner, she confirmed that the itinerary is very elaborated and hits all the good spots. I took the trip with Ahmed and Mohammad, and they took care of me very well though out the whole trip. Pick up and drop off on time, constant check up on me see whether i need anything or special request. It was Ramadan during my trip, so they basically had no food and water through out the whole day time. And with the high temperature and dryness in the desert, Ahmed and Mohammad were still being very professional. It was definitely a pleasant trip, and above all, very safe and secured, which is important. Apart from that, 2 days after my trip, Youssef offered the car to send me to the airpot, and Ahmed came to pick me up again. It was a very pleasing service. I just want to tell all the solo female traveller, Morocco might not seem easy to deal with at the beginning, but don't be deceived by the boys on the street (after10 days i agreed with the local people, most of the boys are nothing more than verbal, for a few penny as reward, but nothing harmful at all). Most of the people i met in morocco are very nice and kind, as long as you don't hold up the presumption you have from hearing from internet."

This company is highly recommended especially when you want to discover many cities in Morocco but do not have time or expertise to plan for such a trip."

After reading the reviews here, we two girls from London decided to embark on a three-days desert tour with Rough Tours, we were picked up by dear Driss who is the driver and the guilder at the same time and also is so nice and professional, we set off from Merrakech and head for Fes through Sahara desert. All services which Rough Tours provided were so perfect, the hotel, the route, the meals, the cars and so on. I have been to many places but never use a tourism service before, this is the first time, and which made me so surprised and satisfied. I really want to thank dear Driss who is now a good friend of us and dear Youseff who is the manager of Rough Tours for so wonderful and amazing journey. I highly recommend Rough Tours to all friends who want to feel the beauty of Morocco, and I can assure you that you would never regret about it."

My sister and I traveled for three days with our driver and guide, Ishmael from Marrakesh to Fez, stopping at many beautiful sites and cultural hot spots along the way. Despite his Ramadan fasting and the heat, Ishmael was gregarious, knowledgeable and even gave us suggestions on what do during other parts of our trip. We listened to great tunes as we drove through the breathtaking countryside and he came with us during many of the stops. The 4X4 was super comfortable and the AC worked fine. The one night stay in the desert near Mergouza was one of the coolest most memorable experiences of my life. Our camel guide, Saiid, was hilarious and personable making the voyage a lot of fun. Camels aren't super comfortable, folks, so having a good desert guide like Saiid is essential. The food at the desert camp was fresh and delicious. I could probably eat 3 of those chicken tajins at once. The beds were comfortable and clean and I slept like a baby. My sister and I had never been to Morocco before, so this was the ideal way to travel from Marrakesh to Fez. I am absolutely enchanted by this country thanks to our stellar guides. Many thanks, Rough Tours. I will highly recommend you to family and friends."

He's very detail-oriented and genuinely cares about every aspect of it. We spent 4 days with our guide Hassan and driver Mahgoub and they were a pleasure. Hassan is extremely knowledgable about all subjects regarding Morocco and answered every question we had succinctly and intelligently. He's a living Wikipedia page. Mahgoub was really helpful, kind and funny and they were a great team together. When we returned, Youssef even planned airport and bus transfers for us around Marrakech free of charge!This is a company that really cares and my girlfriend and I highly recommend them! Try and get the Hussan and Mahgoub team if you can :)"

We were so glad we booked a private tour and our guide Rachid was delightful, knowledgeable and more than happy to answer any question we had about life, culture, customs and history of Morocco. We though the tour was good value for money considering all overnight stays (in lovely hotels and ryads), breakfasts and dinners were all included, as well as the highlight of a camel trek out to the Sahara for the night, with sand boarding on arrival, delicious food and glamping in a Bedouin tent with a proper toilet and shower facilities! The sights of the Atlas Mountains, gorges and small villages were breathtaking and Rachid was very informative about wherever we went. The owner Youssef could also not have been more helpful going above-and-beyond to ensure our trip was as good as it could possibly be. Book a private tour with this company and you will not be disappointed! Thank you Rough Tours."

We joined roughtour in the end based of our friend's recommendation and it was surely one of the best tour experiences, ever, which even propelled me write a review for the first time!We took the 3 days tour going from Fes to Marrakech, and spending one night in the desert under the starry stars. Rachid, was our tour guide, and he was one of the most lively tour guides I've ever met. He was passionate about his culture and we all felt a strong urge from him wanting to explain to us, his country, his people, his origin and his culture. Rachid explained the history and origin of the various site we visited very well and there was never a dull moment on the car. In addition, he felt like a caring friend, as he would time to time, ask us, how he could improve our tour experience and he always came up with a solution one way or another. Last but not least, you would feel you are taken care of on this tour. 3 of us were pretty tired from travelling from Asia and graduation arrangements in the UK, Rachid would occasionally play some music and dance and sing in the car to lighten up the mood on the car, he's definitely the guide you want for a real Morocco experience. In terms of the arrangement of the tour, it was really well planned, eventful enough but did not feel too packed. The guide also told us to inform them to stop if there were sceneries on the way that caught our attention. On this tour, you will travel through the lands of golden sands to the lower canions to the high atlas of Africa; stopping by unesco world heritage site Ait Benhaddou on the way, which was breath taking. Addi, our driver, also deserves special mentioning. Great steady driving with great pacing.Lastly, after the tour, we spent two days in the Medina of Marrakech. Roughtough offered to come pick us up and drop us at the airport. It is always good to know your last car ride to the airport is safe and care free, felt like being driven to the airport by a friend.In summary, the rough was a good blend of culture exploration, heritage site seeing, easy breezy chilling and mingle with good friends experience\u2026 but at the same time feel SAFE and TAKEN CARE OF, which to me, is the most things going on holiday. I would highly recommend this to you, world!"

She had done a tour with Rough Tours the previous year and insisted on using them again. We sent Youssef a vague itinerary of what we wanted to see and he customized a tour based on our requests. He picked us up from the Casablanca airport (after patiently waiting as our flight arrived late) and immediately stopped to buy us water and snacks for the road. Having been on tours in many different countries, the guide/driver makes all the difference and the professionalism and friendliness was immediately apparent with the Rough Tours company. The drivers and guides are knowledgable and passionate about their country and dedicated to ensuring we were well taken care of the whole time. I would recommend taking a tour like this over an overcrowded tour bus any time! Youssef would stop whenever we needed to (which happens to be a lot for me) and we never felt rushed. I even showed him a picture of a waterfall that we had not planned on seeing and he went out of his way to take us, which made for a very long day of driving, but was happy to do it. The vehicles are clean and comfortable and the drivers take safety very seriously, there were a couple of roads that might have given me a heart attack had Youssef not been driving!Our accommodations were booked for us at each destination and they were all amazing. We had day tours booked in Fez and Marrakech, both led by knowledgable and energetic women who were genuinely happy to be showing us their cities. I will definitely go back to Morocco and would not hesitate contacting Youssef again!I could go on but as you see, the reviews speak for themselves and are not over exaggerated! So stop reading reviews and book already!"

It was the best travel experience I could imagine and I sincerely wish I could experience every country I travel to in the future this way. It can be hard to fully experience the culture of another country without knowing someone there but this trip was like visiting a very knowledgable friend who drove us throughout Morocco and made sure we had the trip of a lifetime. We learned so much about Berber culture and Morocco from Driss. We loved meeting his very hospitable mother and sister who made us an amazing, traditional lunch at his home. We also got to have tea at Moha's (the owner) uncle and aunt's home and they were very kind and welcoming. Visiting the friend's of nomad's project in Ramlia was also a highlight since we got to interact with the local kids who were so much fun. We brought them some school supplies, I got to practice my french, and they practiced their english with us and taught us how to write our names in berber and arabic. We were incredibly impressed with all of our riads, which were beautiful, comfortable, perfectly located and welcoming, with excellent breakfasts. The price of the trip is excellent for what it includes and beyond worth it. It is very professional and organized while being natural and flexible to what you want to do and see. We are so grateful to our dear friend Driss and to Rough Tours for such a wonderful experience of Morocco!"

Hassan and Adi picked us up in Marrakech at our Riad and we were off to the High Atlas Mountains. In hindsight we had done only a little bit of research on our trip but that made it more exciting. The contrast in landscapes from the north to the south side of the mountains is staggering. And the landscapes changed every few hours. Mountains, valleys, desert, plateau, hills, cities, villages...all just so spectacular. I think we were in the car for about 24 hours over three days, but it was not arduous at all. Our guides were caring, interested, funny and full of personal knowledge of the history and people of the region and they were clearly very proud of their Berber and Moroccan heritage.Don't miss Ait Ben Haddou, the Dades Gorge, and Merzouga.We will definitely recommend Rough Tours to all our friends!Sagaa Africa!"

We travelled to Marrakech back in March and I'd decided to write my first review on this site for Rough Tours then because I was so grateful to Rachyd, Ibrahim & Youssef for making the trip memorable for us - I forgot to do it as a result of procrastination (as is my tendency) but have come back 6 weeks on to do it, that should be a reflection of the conviction held on the quality of the service.We were looking for a bit of Winter sun, didn't really get that but did have a great experience and the highlight of the trip was the 3 day tour to the Atlas mountains and back to Marrakech - which was a last minute addition to the plan.As with all private tours the quality of the guide is everything and we were really fortunate to get Rachyd but you quickly realise that Youssef (the owner) is running a tight ship and they have a pretty solid recruitment process, so there's a certain guarantee of quality (I'm geeky about this stuff so asked a bunch of questions) - confirmed by how consistently good the reviews are.Rachyd (the guide) and Ibrahim (the driver) were excellent but Rachyd made the trip, he was natural and I knew he would be within the first 10 minutes. I'd had an issue with my SD card and needed to buy a new one, as soon as I mentioned it to Rachyd I was looking for signs of discontent as I wanted to see what the guy was about, there was a genuine desire to help me sort the problem out, this would be a mainstay of the time we would spend together, effortless flexibility - he really couldn't do enough for us, remembered the little things we mentioned previously and made them happen, sometimes surprising us because we'd forgotten! - the sign of a great host and he was. Great knowledge and a great manner.Understandable to be sceptical about how overwhelmingly positive the reviews are, it's for good reason and genuine - this is the kind of company you hope to stumble on to help you make memories, you won't regret it"

We stopped whenever we needed to since our 2 boys (7 and 11) are drinking and eating machines. Youssef answered every question we had and more...nothing was taboo. After we crossed the High Atlas mountains with beautiful snow, we dropped back down into the valleys and saw lots of beautiful areas/settlements to include Ait Ben Haddou where they filmed Gladiator, Game of Thrones, and many biblical movies. We stayed in a beautiful hotel and then on to Merzouga and the Sahara Desert. My boys said the camel ride up the dunes to the Berber camp we stayed in was better than any video games, to include Call of Duty; strong praise indeed. After a magical night of Berber food, music, and tents, we rode out and then drove all the way to Fez, stopping along the way to see monkeys in a forest and a Swiss city in Morocco (true!). Overall we loved it! The kids even got to drive in the desert ...another bonus. Youssef and his company take pride in their job and are very excellent. Highly recommend."

Some of the highlights of our trip include a camel ride and sunset in the desert, off roading to Youssef's home village (Ramlia), a small village of 35 homes and 400 people 5 km from the Algerian border, sharing tea in a nomad's cave, a delicious lunch in Youssef's aunt's home, a barbeque in a small cafe, sharing tea and a berber pizza with two truck drivers on the side of the road, donated by a local woman, the many beautiful riads and hotels we stayed at. Oh yes, and a spontaneous dance on the road outside a cafe with a tour of local moroccan teachers and students on their spring break. Youssef and the many people we met throughout our journey provided us with a glimpse of the generosity and spirit of the Moroccan people. Youssef was more than just our guide.

My boyfriend and I decided to go with Rough Tours after my parents had a wonderful experience with them a few years ago on a 4 day trip to the desert and a day tour to the Mountains with Mohammed and Youssef. Our tour was a day tour to the Ourikka Valley followed by a beautiful Camel ride and Mint tea served in a real Berber family. The guides are very knowledgeable, professional and helpful in choosing which tour to go for according to what we were looking for. Rough Tours are very organised and always make sure you have the best experience ever. Where to start.. The boys are brilliant and very friendly, both called Mohammed, one of them our guide, spoke Italian but they both speak exceptionally well multiple languages, from French, Spanish to English. The boys where very helpful and dedicated, you can see from how they speak how passionate they are about their land and culture - They just make you love Marocco and its people. They are very professional in their job and satisfy every request and more. They always go the extra mile! The car was super comfy and the driver very cautious.The walk in the mountains to the waterfalls was a blast (sometimes a bit difficult for me, as not use to it as it was very steep) but Mohammed helped me up and down the mountain making sure I always ok. He made us stop at the water falls where he told us various stories and the history and the culture of Moroccans. He never rushed us and also stopped with us at halfway and offered us a Mint tea \u2013 very refreshing! On our way back, after a real Berber lunch sitting near the river and on the floor, I really enjoyed the camel ride in the mountains. Having tea with the Berber family was one of My favourite things. The family was so welcoming and so nice to have allowed us to go into their house and share with us their afternoon tea. Mohammed in depth showed us the house and all their tools to make bread, Henne, butter, yogurt, Argan oil etc.. all hand made at home. Not to forget, Youssef is founder of a very important association called Friends for Nomads and takes part in an association called Pack for a Purpose where people can pack their laguage with things necessary for the Nomads children. I think it is a wonderful and very honourable gesture. Of course when I read it I decided to pack for purpose as well and bring what I could for the children. I would definitely suggest Rough Tours to anyone Who is going to Marrakech or Marocco that wants to live and feel the real Moroccan lifestyle and culture. Rough Tours Thank you again for making our trip so wonderful. I will be back for the desert tour as soon as possible!"

Booking was easy to organise and when I requested the Ourika tour and Ouarzazate, the friendly member of staff suggested we swap our tour days in order to see a weekly market - which was greatly appreciated!Day 1: On day one, our guide Hussain arrived at our hotel on time and was very attentive. He offered us some bottles of water and was incredibly fun! He took us to Ourika valley, where he stopped for some scenic photos along the route. He played some traditional music and told us all about the lifestyle. Both my friend and I are not massive history fans, but the knowledge he shared was really interesting. Hussain took us up to see a gorgeous waterfall which was a fun trek. He was very encouraging and was ensuring our safety at all times - helping us to climb up, watching us cross roads and making sure we went at a steady pace.We stopped for lunch and had traditional food, followed by camel rides and mint tea at a family home. By the end of the day, we felt like we had made a friend!Day 2: Again, we were greeted by our guide on time and this time we were with Rasheed and his driver. The SUV which picked us up was very clean and lots of space. He spoke great english and knew lots of information about Morrocco.He was very fun and made an effort to energise us (we were quite tired after an early start). We were given some traditional Berber names which helped us feel like we fitted in.The journey was a long drive to Ouarzazate, however there were lots of fun stops along the journey to help break it up - including a small trek, argon oil farm and lovely picture spots.The roads through the mountains were very sharp and windy - however, we had an excellent driver who drove with great safety.Rasheed was very fun and pointed out some colourful lizards. He even tried to catch some at one point and was great to see him try really hard to give us the opportunity to see the lizards up close.On our return to Marrakech, Rasheed was very kind and bough us some traditional Morrocan pastries which were yummy!If we return to Marrakech, we would definitely book with Rough Tours again and I would highly suggest the two guides we had!Thank you again,Scott"

I was a little apprehensive about booking this tour from the States, but the 3 day journey through the Atlas Mountains, the desert, and world heritage sites was simply amazing. Youseff (sp?) the owner of the company was very easy to deal with, providing quotes via email and then scheduling the actual date. We were picked up at our Riad in Marakech by the two Husains (sp?), one a driver and the other our guide. We were delivered safely to our riad in Fez after the tour. They even helped us secure tickets at the train station for our trip from Fez a few days before they took us to our riad in Fez. Along the way, we stopped to get pictures and eat at places that provided very good value. The highlight of the trip was the camel ride to our camp in the desert on the 2nd night. We had a group of 3 people (2- 64+ and one 35). Along the way our guides provided a lot of information about the people and places in Morocco, and were obviously very proud of their Berber heritage. No questions were off limits and they were very cheerful and accomodating to our needs. We took the 3 day tour and there was a lot of driving on the 3rd day. If we were to do this again, we would opt for the 4 day tour as our bums were getting pretty numb with all the driving."

            "review": "Unforgettable Experience with Amazing Guide and Driver. First I just want to say that if you are looking for a tour group you need to look no further. Rough Tours were all I could have asked for an more. The guide was an amazing person and unbelievably knowledgable. I learned a lot more than just factorial history of the place. He really showed me what he could of Moroccan culture there and gave me a glimpse into Morocco from all perspectives. I am forever grateful Rachyd. I had two friends who used them a month before I was in Morocco. They recommend them highly so I went with them and wasn't disappointed. The stories from my friends were all positive and were very happy with them. From their praises I didn't even research another tour group. My trip to Morocco was for a week and I used their services for 3 days where I tailored one of their packages a little. They were very understanding and easy to work with when I told them my time and location constraints. They always e-mailed me back very quickly and were always good at communicating everything. I took a tour from Marrakech to Merzouga however I had to go back to Marrakech instead of continuing onto Fez. They told me the pros and cons of that and let me understand the driving times and distances in order to make that work. Very helpful.Personally I wanted a solo trek for my trip to Morocco. This was amazing however this tour was a little expensive because of it as I was the only person on it. They don't do group tours where they put different people together. This is completely understandable because people may want to stop in certain places when others don't. This would make for a very difficult tour. Therefore I could control everything (within reason) on the tour I was on. If I wanted to stay in a place a little longer and not do certain things that was perfectly okay. The guide and driver were very understanding and flexible. My guide Rachyd picked me up from my Riad in Marrakech and off we went. He walked me through the medina to the Toyota Land Cruiser which was our vehicle for the tour. I met the Driver Ibrahim there who was a great guy. Off we went.The tour itself was amazing and well planned out. I won't go through all of the places and everything since you can read that all on their site. However where they stop and what you see is very well thought of and the timing of everything was very good. I never felt I was wasting my time with anything. If I needed anything they would stop and all the meals were on time (as in I wasn't starving and had to wait a long time before we got to wherever we were going).The guide was amazing. Rachyd used to be a Berber himself and traveled between the high and low Atlas Mountains with his family. Since he was berber he really knew so much more about everything because of that. He showed me some pretty amazing places and taught me so much. He was always helpful and treated me more as a equal than just some tourist he was touring. I can go on at length about his knowledge and character but I will share one story that sums it up best. He forgot to buy me a scarf to make the turban for the camel trek (to stay cool/stop sand). This was because I deviated a little from the schedule to take photos of the dunes. Because of this, his solution was to cut his in half for me to have one. He didn't even ask to tell me about it before he did it. He just came up to me told me her forgot to get me one and handed me 1/2 of his. His was 7 meters long he said so I now have 1/2 his scarf. He really put me and my comfort first the whole trip. For him to cut his own scarf in half for me was something I will never forget. It is one of the best souvenirs from anywhere I've been that I will keep and continue to use as a scarf. This was also a good parallel to the Moroccan people as well. All the locals I met were all amazing people. The driver Ibrahim was a great guy too. I spent less time with him however he was still a great guy and added to my experience. He was an amazing driver and I never questioned his driving. He was always courteous with the locals and would be very respectful. He would honk the horn lightly to let cyclists and motorcyclists he was passing them. Speaks a lot when people do that. He also let me plug in my phone to listen to music on the last day when we had a long drive. Nothing but respect for him.The organization of everything was perfect. Nothing was out of sync and the timing was perfect. The places we stayed we all amazing, the \"camping\" in the desert was probably 5 stars as well (great food, comfy, warm, electricity). Really impressed with all of it.The tour was full of Rachyd or Ibrahim going above and beyond my expectations however the end of the tour really showed this. They drove me to the train station and Rachyd took me personally to the ticket office to get my ticket with me. He didn't have to do that nor did I ask him to. I got to Marrakech by the train so I could do this however he did this anyways. Then when I almost got locked out of my Riad after he dropped me off, I e-mailed him and he was prepared to come back to help me out. Luckily I got into my Riad without him having to do this but he was prepare to come help me out even after the tour was over. I will definitely go back to Morocco and if I need a tour I would without a doubt book with Rough Tours again. Even if Rachyd was busy I would try to meet up with him in Morocco when I go back. Great guy and one I won't forget. The whole experience was completely worth the cost. I personally feel a little closer to the culture that Rachyd showed me and I won't forget it. Thank you so much for everything and the experiences I had with you. I can't say enough about Rough Tours and I will not forget my time with them."

Youssef is very easy to contact and was very helpful with organising our tour. We started in Fes and had a three day tour, finishing in Marrakech. Our guide Omar and our driver Addi are both great guys, they were able to tell us a lot about the places we visited as well as other information about Morocco. Our vehicle was modern and very comfortable. Some of the highlights of the tour included a camel ride in the Sahara desert where we then camped overnight, visiting the Todgha Gorge, and driving through the Atlas Mountains. The scenery of Morocco is stunning and a lot of the time we were happy just to look out the window and take it all in. If you are looking for a tour in Morocco that is great value then I would absolutely recommend this one."

I cannot stress how much better this private tour was then some of the other more public and bigger tours. Rough Tours allowed us to go at our own pace and visit what we wanted, when we wanted for how long we wanted. I highly recommend anyone interested to go with Rough Tours as you will not be dissapointed!"

This trip is an aggressive 3 days filled with travelling & sightseeing, and I really can\u2019t imagine doing it without a company like Rough Tours (that offers comfortable private transportation with separate driver & guide). We chose this trip to see Erg Chebbi, but were really impressed with and enjoyed all of the other places that were included as part of the itinerary.The entire team was very flexible and accommodating, starting with our last-minute booking. I messaged Youssef on a Friday morning & we left the next day on Saturday morning. And on the road, driver Mohammed & guide Rachyd also complied with our requests to eat in certain types of places and to make stops in villages and for specific shopping needs. When I took this trip, I\u2019d been living & working in Morocco for 8 months, yet I still learned many more things about Berber and Moroccan culture during the time I spent with Rachyd and Mohammed. They were very open and willing to answer all of the questions my friend & I had. It was a fun, pleasant, educational and adventurous 3 days!"

Our guides, Mohammed and Mohcine, were amazing and super kind and helpful. They taught us a lot about Moroccan culture and Berber traditions specifically. We drove for hours but we enjoyed every second of the beautiful scenery and the conversation with our guides. We could ask them about anything and they always gave us very in depth answers and were very friendly. It helped us to really get a feel for the culture there, since that was what we were most interested in. Unfortunately we had some problems with lost baggage on our trip, but Mohammed and Mohcine were extraordinarily helpful about it! They helped us call the airlines and try to figure out what happened, and then drove us to the airport to wait with us for 2 hours while we tried to find our bags. The tour ended that day, but the next day they still came by our riad and helped us get official forms notarized. Another person from the company then drove the luggage from Fes to Marrakech overnight so we could have it in the morning. Amazing customer service!Overall I can't imagine my Morocco experience without this tour. Definitely my favorite part of our trip and 100% would recommend to everyone!"

Mohammed and Mohcine were such wonderful guides throughout our trip. Mohammed was so knowledgeable about Berber culture, the desert, and Morocco in general. He was always willing and happy to share information with us on a wealth of topics, from Berber irrigation techniques to Moroccan festivals. Mohammed and Mohcine were extremely helpful and accommodating, constantly asking us if we wanted photos taken or if we wanted to stop at various places. We also had some issues with lost baggage and riad reservations, and they went out of their way to help us. At the end of our tour, they drove us to the airport and waited for almost two extra hours with us to try and help us get our luggage issue sorted out. Since we weren't able to resolve the issue then, the day after our tour ended, Mohammed even returned to help us again. In the end, the company had someone drive our luggage from Fes to Marrakech overnight so that we could have it by our 7 am flight the next morning.Overall, Mohammed and Mohcine truly went above and beyond in meeting our requests and sharing information about Morocco with us. It would be hard to find two nicer or more knowledgable guides!!! Rough Tours in general is just so customer service oriented. Honestly, we cannot imagine another tour company offering as high a quality introduction to Morocco!"

It was a phenomenal tour in which the four of us learned a lot about Moroccan culture, and the tour company transitioned us seamlessly from site to site. But what impressed me the most about Rough Tours is that they did so much to make sure that I had a great trip to Morocco. When I flew into Fez, my baggage did not come with me, and it would have stayed in Fez forever since I lost my baggage claim tag. However, the owner Yousef coordinated with his staff to find my baggage in Fez, send someone in Marrakech to type a note in Arabic and notarize it to give my permission for someone to retrieve the bag, and have a driver take it from Fez to Marrakech - all so I could get my bag back. I will be forever grateful to Rough Tours for giving such phenomenal customer service!"

Youssef and our driver Hakim absolutely made our 3-day Fes-to-Marrakech desert trip the most special of our Moroccan adventures, by going above and beyond in every possible way. We were a group of 6 adults and Youssef was able to have all 8 of us in one comfortable car, which was fantastic. Youssef is an entrepreneur, a detail-oriented business owner and a fabulous guide. He quickly returned emails and answered all of our questions. There is no need to haggle the price of his tour - it is a very good value worth every dollar/euro/dirham. During our 3 days together, Youssef answered endless questions about Moroccan culture, religion and daily life and he regularly surprised us with little delights - things that other tour guides either do not provide or they nickel-and-dime you for. Hakim so expertly and safely drove us through the countryside and mountain passes, and at every stop he quickly jumped out of he car to open our doors - a true gentleman. Here was our itinerary - yours may vary based on what you want to see or do:Day 1- about 8 hours including driving and bathroom/meal/sight stops before arriving in Merzouga. An hour camel ride into the desert for an unforgettable night under the stars. Day 2- desert sunrise, camel ride back to car, then about 6 hours including driving and bathroom/meal/sight stops before arriving in the Dades area for overnight. Day 3- about 8 hours including driving and bathroom/meal/sight stops. The Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah is so cool and well worth the time to walk through it. Overall, there are plenty of stops (with clean restrooms) to take a break - you will feel like a rock star because these guys know everyone and it was fun to see people greet them (and us) like family. The night in the desert was something that I will never forget - a camel ride, the cool powdery sand on my feet, an exquisite 4-course dinner, playing the drums and dancing with the Berbers under a sky filled with vibrant stars, then waking very early (it's worth it!) to experience a sunrise over the dunes. Awesome!Youssef and Hakim gave us Moroccan memories of a lifetime!"

On my friend's bday in the desert, Mohammed organized a surprise-cake and small party with traditional music and a not-so-moroccan traditional birthday song (since Berbers do not usually celebrate birthdays).

The responses from Youssef at Rough Tours were not only very prompt and professional but made us feel that he understood what we were looking for. We went ahead and booked (family of 5, children 16,13,10) and were really impressed when, even after booking, his focus was on making sure we were satisfied with the service he provided (e.g. he arranged to pick us up from the airport the day before our tour started, took us to our riad and organised for someone to guide us to the riad even though this was not part of the tour).The next morning Youssef picked us up in his 4x4 (white Mitsubishi very comfortable) for a 3 day tour: Marrakech to Boumalne Dades to Merzouga to Marrakech. He advised us that it was going to be a long drive back to Marrakech on the third day and he was spot on. The trip itself was amazing, great itinerary, lovely places to stay and good food. Youssef makes sure that the restaurants you eat in are very clean, food preparation is safe and the toilets you stop at are a good standard.So far so good but what made Youssef really stand out for us was when a couple of things didn't go to plan. One of our daughters' was sick (nothing to do with the food). Youssef went out of his way to find an open pharmacy on a Sunday, helped us to work out what medicine was best and offered to drive us to the local hospital in the middle of the night (this was fortunately not required). Also, the road back to Marrakech was blocked by snow and Youssef kept us fully informed, gave options for getting back and always remained calm and in good humour in spite of a possible 5 hour detour.As our younger daughter said, Youssef is not just a tour guide, he's a friend. He was great fun, really knowledgeable and made our trip to Morocco a magical experience. We cannot recommend Youssef and Rough Tours enough, if we could give him 6 out of 5, we would have."

Secondly, I am very impressive with Mohamed, the young Berber Gentleman who took us from Marrakech to FES ( 3 days tours). Mohamed is very knowledgeable and he told us a lot of stories about the Berber life and how they share and help each other. He treat us like friends, I also trust him that he will make sure we have good experience during the trip. Also he take care of my 5-year-old son, Mohamed played with my son and my son likes him. I highly recommend you to book with Rough tour and ask for Mohamed as your travel guide."

            "review": "Authentic travel experience without feeling like \"a tour\". My husband selected Rough Tours based on the Trip Advisor Reviews. Let's just say that all of the glowing reviews are well-deserved!Our guide/driver was Youssef Boughrara (the company manager/co-founder). Youssef is as a young, educated, entrepreneurial Moroccan-Berber man with a warm reassuring smile and great sense of humor. It felt like we were seeing Morocco through the lens of a close family friend. We felt very safe and relaxed (very low stress) at all times.Youssef has a very good understanding of what travelers who book through Rough Tours (and not through the large group tours) want. He takes you to the tourist sites (after all, that is why you are there) but goes out of his way to avoid the \"tourist traps\".  We did a 3-night/4-day trip that began & ended in Marrakech. Day 1 : Marrakech - Ait Benhaddou - Dades valleyDay 2 : Dades Valley- Merzouga via Todra GorgeDay 3 : Merzouga - Ouarzazate. Day 4 : Ouarzazate - MarrakechSome of the best experiences weren't even part of our official itinerary -- We had tea & bread with a nomadic family in the middle of the dessert and got to see camels that had just been born a few days ago and learn more about their lifestyle.Youssef took us to a couple of the local markets (depends on the day of the week). The biggest was in Rissani -- near Merzouga. We truly felt like we had stepped back to the 1800's. It was so incredible to get full explanations of what was going on in the market around us -- the donkey parking lot, the sheep sales, and more. He also helped us purchase some spices -- easier than trying to deal alone with vendors in Marrakech.If you book with Rough Tours - check out the foundation that they have for their school for the children of Nomads. \"Friends of Nomads\".We wish we could find more companies like Rough Tours in other countries we plan to visit."

I would probably recommend Spring or Autumn.Fanatstic!"

We spent over 4 days with the two Mohameds and every hour was a new adventure, a great conversation, and a fun time traveling with them. I learned so much about Morocco, the Berber culture, the Islamic religion, and the historical and present-day insight into the country from all that they shared with us. They were so energetic and knowledgable about everything, and were such an amazing resource to introduce us to Morocco and its society. I would go back today with our two young sons because of what a memorable trip it was with Rough Tours. Through the Atlas Mountains, off-road, into small villages, and back to the big city was all made perfect by our tour guides. We missed them when our trip was over and still think of them often!"

Our guide Ali was amazing and made our trip truly unforgettable. The ride from Marrakech to Ait-Ben Haddou was gorgeous and Ali pointed out everything along the way and answered all of our questions. The hotel on the first night was beautiful and offered relaxation after a long day of travel. The second day was filled with more sightseeing, highlighted by a stop in the Dades Gorge, a stop in our guides town, which made it that much more authentic, and a trip to the desert. The night in the desert was perfect and the dinner that was made for us was outstanding thanks to Hasan and Mustapha. I would recommend this trip to anyone traveling to Morocco and I would be sure to request Ali as your guide as he really made the trip that much better for us."

We saw really amazing sites of Morocco, from the overnight camping in the Sahara desert, a nomad village, the atlas mountains, canyons, oasis, the hollywood of Morocco, and sooo much more! We stayed in beautiful hotels that were included in the tour and ate amazing Moroccan food. I cannot express how awesome this trip was!! I HIGHLY recommend this company and tour to anyone!!!"

We are usually do it yourself type tourists - but a trip to Morocco seemed a bit daunting and we were running out of time so we took the advice of a friend who had recently returned from a tour with Rough Tours and had them book our holiday. Best decision ever. We were nearly 4 hours late arriving to the Fez airport but Mohahammed was there and greeted us warmly. He got us settled into our Riad for the night. We spent the next day in Fez with a tour guide that Rough Tours arranged for us. After a day in Fez we were picked up by Youseff (the nephew Youseff - there are two at Rough Tours!) and taken on a 4 day journey from Fez to Marrakech that left us wanting much more of Morocco and our time with Youseff. He was ever patient with our many questions, our children and many request for bathroom stops. He took us to places a bit off the beaten path and treated us like friends...not clients. We could not have picked a better company and guide for our time in Morocco. From the accommodations they booked for us to the highlights along the way, everything was top notch. Rough Tours made the trip more than just a vacation but a life experience that we will never forget."

As our two children were with us we asked if the pace of the tour could be slowed down a bit by adding on an extra day; making it 4 days in total. We were so glad that we did, as the kids really enjoyed the road trip through the Atlas Mountains. From the get-go, we were picked up at our Riad right on time and brought to our clean and comfortable SUV. Mohammed was a friendly, engaging, knowledgeable, courteous and safe driver and guide. A lot of adjectives, we know, but he exceeded our expectations as we were in great hands every step of the way. He stopped whenever we needed to step out and stretch our legs. One of our children had motion sickness from the windy roads and change in altitude, and Mohammed accommodated us all the way through with his can-do and pleasant demeanor. He not only gave us a wonderful overview of Moroccan culture in general, but also of the Berber culture, of which he is from. Our dromedary (camel) ride into the Erg Chebbi desert for a one-night stay under the starry skies was spectacular. There was also an amazing full moon to admire while the camel guides played drums, sang and encouraged us to play songs from our cultures (our son and another young chap played a few songs on guitar). They are professional, courteous and very trustworthy. We went with Morocco on our minds and have left with Morocco now in our hearts forever! Thank you so much Youssef and Mohammed! Inshallah, we will return again very soon!"

We did a pretty extensive research for a tour that would show us the best of Morocco, but also let us experience the culture. We made the BEST choice with Roughtours. My husband and I had a 4 day tour departing from Fes to Marrakech, with our guide Mohammed and our driver Ibrahim. We asked for a spanish or english tour, and we had both, and even had the chance to practice my italian! Mohammed speaks more than 6 languages, he's very friendly and energetic, and both of them were always happy to show us more of their beautiful culture. It was our first time in Morocco, and Mohammed was happy to answer every of our questions about the culture, territory, architecture, gastronomy... And even new words in arabic and berber. We had SO much fun. The car was a 4x4 air conditioned, and Ibrahim was a very safe driver, even in the desert. Mohammed was constantly sharing with us his knowledge about berber culture, arabic, and about every city we visited or passed by. They both took care of everything for us and were always on time. We learned so much with this tour. We felt completely comfortable and safe with them.We had an amazing camel ride to the bivuac, spent a wonderful night in the desert and came back in the morning by camel. What an amazing and unforgettable experience! Breakfasts and dinners that were included were amazing. Lunches were OK since we always stopped on the road: hence, more touristic places. Our guides always asked if the restaurants were ok, since they were the only part not included, but we didn't took the time to search anywhere else for restaurants and the price was reasonable, so we were Ok with them. You guys made our time in Morocco very special, thanks for everything Moroccan friends :) we will definitely use Roughtours services every single time we go back to Morocco.

Our guide and driver, Hassan and Ibrahim, are two amazing fellows that not only took care of us in every single step of the tour, but were also incredibly knowledgable and a true pleasure to have around. The organization of the tour itself was flawless, everything was beautiful and our guide never missed an opportunity to enrich our experience by constantly providing us with informations and opportunities to share his knowledge of such a beutiful country. All the stops on the trip were breathtaking, not to mention the splendid experience of having a camel (dromedary?) ride on the Merzouga dunes and spend the night in a beautiful camp watching stars and sharing jokes with berbers, truly kind and hospitable people. A special mention goes to the company owner, Youssef. Since the beginning he's been very helpful with the organization of our trip,moreover he provided a driver to take us to Marrakech airport on our final day even if our tour with them was finished three days before! That it is what I call an excellent company that really takes care of their customers. In concusion, we can say that 3 days with Hassan ans Ibrahim have been a gift to us, we enjoed every minute of it! The only problem is that they won't accept the fact that Italian olive oil is better than the Morrocan one ( ;-) ), but what can I say, no one is perfect! We truly recommend Roughtour to everyone, in fact we will definetly contact them again for our next trip to Morocco, which I hope will happen very soon. Thank you again guys!"

They always insisted on carrying our bags, opening doors for us, and making sure we were happy and comfortable at all times.We enjoyed the sites we saw on this tour in the mountains and desert much more than we enjoyed the cities that we visited in Morocco.We spent one night in a hotel and one night in the desert sleeping in a tent. Being two city girls...we had been a bit concerned about the lack of facilities for our night in the desert. However, much to our surprise, our tent had an electrical light in it, and there was a permanent concrete structure bathroom with a light, toilet, shower and hot/cold running water. In addition, the men at the camp were extremely accommodating and surprised us with a delicious dinner, hot water bottle to warm our beds, and gloves to keep us warm while we sang and drummed by the fire.The whole night was worth it just to see the AMAZING sky full of stars and moon rise like you have never seen before."

The itinerary was the one which can be seen in all reviews (Atlas, Ait Ben Addou, Dades Valley, Tudra gorge, Merzouga and Erg Chebbi, Dra Valley, Merzouga). We reserved online only on the basis of the enthusiastic reviews on Tripadvisor. We did not really know what to expect from both the trip and the company. To be honest we felt we were taking a little of a bet. However, Youssef, the owner, promptly answered to all our questions and sent us pictures of the tent camp upon our request. His availability and promptness gave us more confidence and relief. Once in Morocco the trip was absolutely perfect. One of the biggest assets was the guide: Adil. A talented 28 yrs old Berber guy very proficient in English and knowledgeable of the territory and Moroccan culture. His enthusiasm and passion were the 5th companion of our trip. He explained to us every bit of Berber culture, showed to us stunning landscapes and sceneries, played drums around the bonnefire in the Berber camp and helped us with all our requests without never being pushy or inappropriate. The trip itself was above any expectation. Top of the list were the desert experience and the moltitude of breathtaking vast landscapes. The accommodations and evening suppers were very nice. Especially the Xaluca terrace was wow. We stopped for lunch mainly in touristic places (we never requested to go elsewhere even if Adil always asked if the places were ok for us), but the food was good and the price fair. Plus in the middle of nowhere we did not really bother to check other places. The driver Ahmid was excellent and careful not to displease us with the drive especially in the curvy roads of the Atlas. Overall the experience was made very unique by the combination of both the awesome sites and the organisation of Rough Tours which left us with the only burden to relax and enjoy the magnifence of this country."

Now I can say they were more than true! Already the answer to my first email to the agency was exeeding my expectations - I got an email with an offer within half an hour! As price and offer were also reasonable to us, we decided to book the offer for an indvidual tour for our party of two from Rough Tours.My husband and me were collected already a few minutes before the agreed time in our Riad in Marrakech from Mohammed, our guide for the next days and Ahmed, our driver. Already on our way out of the city to the Atlas mountain, Mohammed told us a lot of interesting stories. We heard a lot of different things about the Marocain and Berber culture, how people actually live in the country... and we had a lot of fun! Both guys didn't miss a chance to make us feel comfortable and were great hosts!The tour itsself was a long drive by car, but it was defintely worth it: From the Atlas mountains, we drove to the Marocain \"Hollywood\", Aid Benhaddou and the Dades Valley, going on to the Todra Gorge and to the desert the next day. We acutally spent a night at a berber tent in the desert - after we hade a camel ride into the sunset... awesome! The day after we drove trough beautiful landscapes to Quarzazate. On our last day Mohammed and Ahmed drove us to Agadir, still fully engaged in showing us their country.We can only recommend Rough Tours and especially the two guys - they made our trip special by letting us have a lot of fun and adding a lot of additional stuff to our schedule... like sitting on top of the 4x4 while driving in the desert, having a picnic with Berber pizza, showing us where to buy the best dades.....We would again book Rough Tours for a tour in Marocco!"

When arranging the trip, my emails were always answered very promptly. Highly recommended, so book with Rough Tours and don't look back!"

It was awesome, the guides, Rachyd and Abrahim, were so friendly and knowledgeable and made the trip great fun. We did lots of things that you simply wouldn't be able to do if you were doing the trip yourself (e.g. all the offroading in the desert and visiting a desert community which was a great experience). It was also fantastic to ahve the guides who could answer any questions that popped into your head about culture etc. Definitely worth splashing out a few quid to make the most of your trip to Morocco. Excellent value! :)"

We are 3 people group and glad to choose the Rough Day Tours from Marrakech to Fes for 3 days tour, visited Sahara Desert and some small towns as well, we have gotten a lot of fun and truely enjoyed it. Our tour guide, Ilili, who is knowledgeably telling about his own berber culture and history, we learned a lot from this journey. Brahim, he is a reliable driver, when I was in his car, I felt safe and relaxed, two of them are like friends, and made my day !!

I communicated with Youseff by email and had everything worked out before we arrived. He was very attentive and accommodating to my requests and answered emails very timely. Our guide was Mohammad and our driver was Ibrahim. I can not say enough wonderful things about these two guys. Just so kind and friendly and knowledgeable. We were a family of 4 with kids 7 and 10 years old. They were amazing with the kids. We saw so much and did so much in those days, and we all loved every bit of it.The places we stayed and places we stopped for lunch were always very clean, which really helps with the kids. Also our driver and guide seemed to know everyone wherever we went, including police. It just made it all very comfortable and safe.I cant emphasis enough how easy they made this whole trip and just how enjoyable it was. Having a friendly knowledgeable guide made our whole trip in Morocco just amazing and worry-free. We did 7 days out of Marrakech to see kasbahs, go to rural villages, water fall, gorges and a camel ride to an overnight in the dessert.Mohammad was just an amazing guide and we didn't want to say goodbye to him at the end. Ibrahim was a very safe driver and I never felt concerned with road safety. Additionally, my husband is somewhat hindered in his ability to walk with a brace on one leg, and they always went out of their way to accommodate him. Also traveling with children, they always played with the kids and were super kind and helpful with them.My son had his 10th birthday while we were on the trip and they had a little birthday celebration for him. Mohammad and Ibrahim seriously went above and beyond to make us happy.I can't imagine any other tour group could be better run, or more affordable. The cost for what we did was truly amazing, especially when I saw prices for trips through another company in a flyer in our riad in Marrakech."

He was able to withstand our hours of cross-examination and was always in tune as to when we wanted to listen to music, chit chat, have quiet time, or needed to use a \"modern\" washroom. He was also happy to stop for our requests to stop at a pharmacy, wine store, and at a road side pomegranate stand.

Ahmed (never got a last name) was our driver and guide and he was by far the best tour guide I have ever experienced. He was super patient with us (we were constantly late) and very friendly. He took time to teach us all the intricate details of where we were visiting and about the Moroccan culture. He was very accommodating to our needs whether it be special stops for certain foods, allowing us to blast our music in the van, or frequent bathroom breaks. We started in Marrakech and our guide made sure to stop at all the right places for us to take pictures or learn a bit more about the sites. It was a LONG drive during day 1, but we had awesome food and saw basically all the great sites the tour promised such as Ait Benhaddou Kasbah where they filmed multiple films. It was awesome to see where multiple countries used to meet to trade goods. The hotel was awesome too because they had buffet style dinner and cheap drinks! The highlight for me was the camel ride in the Sahara and watching the stars on the dunes at night. There, our camel men cooked us an awesome Berber dinner and we learned to play traditional drums as a group. We joined with 2 other girls in the same camp and quickly became travel friends.The last day of the trip is mostly a blur because of fatigue from camel riding and waking up so early to watch the sun rise from the dessert, but it was so worth it. Our guide Ahmed met us back at the hotel and we started our way to Fes. The highlight of my Morocco trip was by far our Rough Tours experience and our guide Ahmed. He was awesome and we were all sad we had to go the rest of the vacation without him. Unfortunately, I never got his last name and his name isn't listed on the website under guides, but he is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Thanks Rough Tours."

Hassan and Ibrahim left us to have lunch in a gorgeous little place next to the clear waters of the river. The food was delicious and the people were so friendly and lovely. A walk up the mountains to the waterfalls was good and we spoke about life in Morocco. The light towards the end of the day as we drove down the Ourika Valley was absolutely stunning.

We toured Marrakech and Fes on our own and then used Rough Tours for our desert tour. We first met Ismail, our tour guide, when he picked us up from Fes. We soon realized what a gem we had! Ismail was fantastic! He was friendly but not over-bearing. He was talkative and quiet. He was amazingly knowledgeable. He had a selection of music to suit all the travellers. I have no idea how he stores so much information! I traveled with two female friends and at no time did we ever feel uncomfortable. He has a great way of knowing just how to interact with people.As to the tour, it was fantastic! We drove and drove until we reached the desert. But on our way, we stopped for pictures, to stretch a bit and to see the sights. He knew just where to take us but we never felt as though we were in the midst of all the tourists. We rode our camels, on a starry filled night, to the desert. Slept in a tent (luxury tent of course!) and woke to the see the sunset. Rode our camels back and kept on our tour. We saw villages, an olive oil factory, argon oil cooperative, kasbahs, cinema museums, a little hiking and so much more. I was hoping for a particular hotel and Youssef (the owner of the company) was able to arrange it. Our last stop was the Ouzoud waterfall which was gorgeous. It was worth every penny + so much more. Breakfast, dinner and our hotels were included in the cost. I did quite a bit of research and it's a bit scary to pick a company on the internet alone, but I was more than satisfied. Had I of known how challenging Morocco is, we may have used Ismail for other portions of our stay, as well. We did navigate but it is great to have someone who knows so much and knows just where to go. They do day trips, local tours or much longer. Just ask and they seem to be able to accommodate your needs.All in all, I would absolutely recommend Rough Tours and definitely ask for Ismail!"

The whole tour was incredible and we saw more than was expected. The journey on camels to a berber tent in the middle of the sand dunes was an experience! Going out at sunset was stunning. I would warn any travellers though that camel riding for 90mins is extremely uncomfortable. This tour made our trip in Morocco."

The communication from rough tours was fantastic, so efficient and I paid a deposit through PayPal without any problems.On the day of the trip, our tour guide Mohammed arrived with a driver in the most beautifully spacious and air conditioned 4x4. Those who had booked a trip through Thomson looked very jealous as they were herded onto a big hot coach! During our journey Mohammed spoke of the land of Marrakech and Morocco- the traditions, beliefs, culture. It was mesmerising and so fascinating I learned so so so much! In fact when we arrived at the Cascades we didn't want to leave the car because the journey had been so enlightening.Now, the cascades... WOW. Never before in life have I witnessed such beauty. Mohammed got us to the waterfalls before the crowds so we had the place to ourselves to explore. We visited the most wonderful monkeys and fed them as they clambered all over us! They are majestic creatures it was like being in a David Attenborough documentary.We swam in the waterfall and Mohammed became our personal photographer - he took some incredible shots that will last a lifetime.Please book with rough tours and request Mohamed!!! You won't regret it!"

Incredibly good value for a private tour we visited the Ourika Valley in the High Atlas Mountains on a day trip. We booked and paid a deposit before we left the UK - very easy, the emails were replied to almost instantly and very informative. We were collected from our hotel by our very friendly Moroccan guide and driver and given lots of inside information about the local area and people along the way. We had a fantastic day, saw way more than we thought we would and really felt like we had experienced the local landscape and culture without feeling like 'tourists'. If we ever return to Morocco we'd definitely book another tour with Rough Tours, in fact we may return to Morocco purely to experience one of Rough Tours longer excursions!"

He is an excellent driver, knows the roads well, knows exactly where he is going, and always looked after me, concerned for my well-being and comfort.I highly recommend Youssef and his Rough Tour Company.

            "review": "Do it! You Can't Go Wrong with Rough Tours!. If you have decided that a private tour through Morocco is the best option for you (and I can't blame you! This is THE best way to see the country), then spare yourself hours of research and trust me when I say Rough tours is the answer. I had researched multiple tour companies excessively and can confidently say Rough tours stands out. I did the 4 day/3night tour from Fes to Marrakech via the Sahara desert with another solo traveller. Heres the details of my trip:COMMUNICATION: Youssef was very responsive and courteous with communication and replied very fast. I could just tell he was interested in the business compared to other companies. In fact, I had contacted him just the day before departure after 5pm! This was extremely last minute and yet, Youssef still found me a tour with another solo traveller to join! He was talking to me past 11pm to finalize the plans even though it was too late/last minute.PROFESSIONALISM: Youssef was very kind and courteous. My trip was last minute but he did not demand any payment or deposit. Instead, he treated me like a normal paying customer and I took 3 days to pay him! Yet he did not mind at all. Everything promised was delivered. There were no annoying stops at carpet/souvenir shops, as promised on the website)DRIVER: We had the pleasure to drive with Ibrahim. He is a very nice and happy guy and made the trip so much fun! Most importantly, an extremely skilled driver and made us feel safe GUIDE: Our guide was Driss. He was very warm, welcoming, even bought me free breakfast, water etc, paid unanticipated parking or police tickets etc without any hesitation. He even took us to his home in his village on the way to have tea with his family! I really felt at home. Very knowledgeable as well.THE RIDE: This was money well spent! We were in a mitsubishi 4x4, very very comfy and spacious! This actually was the best component of the package for meHOTELS: We stayed in Maison Merzouga, a very quite and calm guesthouse located in Hassa'lbied right at the edge of the golden Sahara sand dunes! It had a great swimming pool even! The owners were extremely kind and fed us very well and treated us like family. Next night was in a small, cozy desert camp. The third night was in the best hotel you can find in the Dades Valley (look it up, its the Xaluca hotel chain) with great panoramic views of the valley. (Note: The WiFi was not working in the rooms though - nothing to do with rough tours management). Dinner and Breakfast were buffet style but felt like we were at a grand luxurious wedding! Very big buffet table!LUNCHES: Driss chose decent places for lunches. Expect to spend 100-120 Moroccan Dirhams for the lunches; this is pretty much the standard across the tourism industry. In Merzouga, we met Moha, Youssef's brother, and he fed us for free! This was very unexpected and very generous of him. He refused to accept payment for this. TOUR CONTENT: What can I say!! Best trip of my life and definitely the highlight. Sahara desert is amazing, the night sky, the camel ride into the sunset, the vast orange dunes, you HAVE to do it once in your life! Do expect to pay tips for some of the activities (e.g. watching the khamlia dance, or having tea with nomads). Tips are very important to sustaining the livelihood of these unfortunate individualsTHE BEST PARTS: 1. I was in a difficult situation since the tour was going to end in Marrakech in the evening and I had a very early flight to catch from a different destination the next morning. My fellow traveller and Driss were kind enough to start early in order to get me to the train leaving marrakech on time. But midway through the day, Youssef was kind enough to make special arrangements for his upcoming tours such that Driss and Ibrahim dropped me at the airport in another city on their way. And for free! They made a special detour for me. I was blown away by this act of kindness and they made my journey a whole lot easier and smoother. This sealed the deal for me and I say honestly I couldnt have chosen better. 2. I got a friends out of the whole thing! If you are a solo traveller, consider joining another solo because a friendship might me awating you! I got along very well with the other solo traveller and throughly enjoyed his company. I'm glad we went from strangers to friends in just 4 days. Also, felt like Driss and Ibrahim had known me for years. SUMMARY: Spare yourself the time and effort and go ahead with Rough Tours. I cannot recommend them highly enough. I was blown away by their kindness, concern and care for their customers, and their amazing delivery of an adventure of a lifetime!"

We went on the waterfall tour that is close to Marrakesh (50min) We were picked up promptly from our hotel by our guide and driver both of whom were friendly, relaxed and made the whole experience exceptional. We chatted all the way there, discussing culture's, history and differences. He was very knowledgeable and able to answer all and every question with very good English. The climb up to the main waterfall was steep but anyone in sturdy shoes and confident on there feet would be fine. The views are beautiful of the waterfalls and the surrounding Valley, so different from the madina and great to see another side of morroco. We stopped off at a local house and was made traditional tea, was great to see how alot of the people live, a unique opportunity. The only disappointing thing was lunch after the waterfalls which was in the village at the bottom. It was very cheap 100/150dh for three courses but the food wasnt very nice and a bit cold. My orange juice was not there lovely jucie I have had else where but watery fake orange medicine flavour. They were happy to change it for a banana milkshake which was nicer. I feel I should say though I do have high standards when it comes to food and have had much nicer in the madina. There was very little available there as well.After saying this I would highly recommend this trip (food is out of their control). It was great fun with great company on a private trip to see more of morroco and some stunning views/waterfalls. If I were to come again I would take there trip into the desert for a few days and get to see more of the rural country"

We were picked up from the hotel at 9 and dropped back at 5. Mustafa was very informative and a real easy going guy who makes you feel like a friend more than a customer. Ali appreciated the fact I pointed out he is named after a bottled water company in Morocco and was a good driver, not crazy like the taxi service in marrakech. We got water on route and headed to the valley where we climbed to a point which was safe being careful with your footing. To go further you need to go up an everyday ladder which is removed and put back when needed, a bit risky and one our tour guide felt was not necessary. I felt this was good judgement as we saw a number of people struggling and you did feel for their safety. We headed back down the mountain to the base of the valley where we had lunch. This was the only disappointment of the day, a 3 course meal for 100 or 150 dirham. The food was very bland and easily the worse meal of the holiday. We have high standards for food and have paid less for better food in morroco. The restaurant was called le noyer as was situated by the river which was the only thing going for it. It was a shame but mustafa assured us this was the best restaurant in the area which at the base of the valley is very touristy. On our return trip we visited a berber family in their home which was lovely. We were warmly greeted and provided with fresh tea and learnt about their way of life. This was very interesting and something most tours would not provide. All in all par the lunch the day or was one of our best days in marrakech. The company has no control over the quality of restaurants available in the area and should not be held against them. Thank you for a fun and entertaining day Ali and Mustafa!"

We skipped the Atlas studios and concentrated on the real morocco. We organized the trip by email just one day in advance. Youssef answered very quickly and was very helpful. We stayed in Marrakech for 6 days and this was by far the most beautiful one.

There are many companies out there all offering similar programmes. We selected Rt based on recommendation, how responsive and helpful they were with really quick replies to e-mail and that you don't need to mess around with Western union type transfers as a deposit. 30euro on PayPal, job done. Could not have been any easier. At the planned time, bang on schedule, two warm smiling faces appeared. Ismail our guide and Ibrahim our driver. Very quickly we felt at ease with these guys and got on our way in a new people carrier type vehicle. Although we had expected to see a 4x4, it soon became clear this is definitely the way to go. Plenty of space and room in very comfortable seats for what is a pretty long journey.In no time at all we were chatting away with Ismail, his English is excellent. He is positive and enthusiastic about Morocco and genuinely delighted to show you the country and the area both he and Ibrahim are from as they are both Berber. He will chat about food, history, religion, geology literally all sorts of everything. For him and Ibrahim clearly the more interest you show in things the better the trip is for them as well and they really do open up as much as you would like. It is not a relentless barrage of information either, there is plenty of quiet time to observe the stunning countryside pass by and they have some really cool music as well. The variety in scenery is astonishing, it really is a beautiful country of many scenes and so many colours. Lots of opportunity to stop and take pictures and generally mooch about, plenty of breaks for drinks and food, a guiding voice when making souvenir purchases, all at a relaxed pace. Both guys are really helpful with nothing too much trouble. The accommodation provided was excellent. You would be hard pressed to improve on it. The actual tour out into the Sahara by camel was everything you hope for; simply incredible. This is not a few sand dunes, this is the real deal and every bit as stunning as the pictures. The unexpected surprise was the journey back via the Souks in Rissani. We timed it, by fluke!, when it was the weekly market. Absolutely incredible. The sights, sounds donkey (car) park was fantastic. Though we thought we had had enough of shopping in Marrakech, this was something so different and of course you are safely in the company of two local guys. Just great. We really took our time to choose a tour company to do this with and are so very pleased with our experience with Rough Tours. If you feel slightly uneasy about trusting all the reviews, feel free to pm me if it will help. Oh yes, and if you want to pay 'in quids' they are happy to accept that to, no currency conversion required!!"

There were also several tasty restaurants along the walk to the bottom of the falls, and some shops as well if you're interested.One highlight for us were seeing the barbary macaques in a natural setting. They hang out at a look-out spot along the walk, and other places along the walk. These monkeys were gorgeous, and not skittish around people (for better or worse). Although you're not supposed to feed them, we saw some locals feeding them, and you can literally just hang out with these monkeys. It was refreshing to see them living happily in nature, after seeing a couple stuck on leashes in Djemaa el Fna.Overall, this dayt rip was one of our highlights while visiting Marrakech."

Mohammed and Ibrahim made us feel completely taken care of from the beginning to the end of our trip. They both know people all around the country and made us feel at home everywhere we went. Mohammed is knowledgeable and provided an intelligent running commentary on the sights and on Berber culture, and Ibrahim drove with skill and amused us at every turn. We traveled with our two daughters and they both loved the experience as much as we did. Their prices are more than reasonable for the super service they provide; we recommend them without reservation!"

We heartily and unreservedly recommend it to anyone seeking to explore the rich culture and history of this wonderful country.We started and ended in Marrakesh, and in between travelled nearly 800 miles through the country - from the scenic Ait Benhaddou ksar, to the cinematic town of Ouarzazate, to the amazing Hotel Xaluca in Dades, to the breathtaking Todgha Gorge and the Erg Chebbi sand dunes, to name just a few.Our guide Ismail and driver Mustafah did much more than show us the country's landscapes - they invited us into the Berber culture. Through their passion and warmth, we experienced the country's sights, sounds and tastes. We will remember them for a long time to come.Bottom-line, we couldn't recommend this more."

I the major advantage is that you can stop whenever you want and wherever you need. Also the drivers are very nice and they can tell you interesting info during the trip. You can find better deals at the Medina, but have in mind that you will be with other people in a mini bus. Also have in mind that the trip to Ouarzazate is quite tough because there are a lot of turns and you can easily can get sick. So I recommend you to be on a private trip with a jeep."

From the pickup to the return back to Marrakech everything was smooth, well organised and relaxed. Mohammed is a very intelligent and thoughtful guide who shared his views about Morocco in perfect English. He even understood our very weird sense of humour. We felt relaxed and enjoyed sharing their company during the long stretches on the trip. Accommodations were 100 per cent fantastic. The driver Ibrahim is very skilled. He went at a steady pace to allow us to take in the sights and was happy to stop anywhere for photos. The picnic with Berber pizza and mint tea under an acacia tree was a fun break off road. We agree with all the other reviews. You can't go wrong with Rough Tours."

Youssef, was courteous and prompt in replying by email, and we have in fact booked several prospective tours with them. Our first trip with Rough Tours (visiting the Ouzoud waterfalls) was pure magic. We had Ismail as our guide, and Hassan as our driver. Although Ismail was quiet in the beginning he really opened up over time. He is a young guide who has heaps of knowledge and history to offer. Rough Tours as a company is really trying to make a difference to make Marrakech a better place by improving the lives of rural berber communities, and children who don't have access to schools. Its a noble cause, and I have uttermost respect for them.The falls in itself were amazing, along with the scenic drive passing little villages along the way in the atlas Mountains. Although there is some walking to do, its not a difficult trek to walk to the falls. We dined in a lovely quaint little restaurant by the falls that had a fantastic view, and had one of the best tagines here. We also saw several Berber macaques along the way. As a word of warning, there are lots of steps to climb up from the bottom of the falls to make your way up to the car park, so wear comfy shoes.We had such an unforgettable and wonderful day with Ismail, it was absolutely faultless. I have no hesitation in recommending Rough Tours, and Ismail as a guide (and Hassan as a driver)."

Every minute was enjoyable and we made some unforgettable memories with two of the friendliest and most knowledgeable people we met on our whole trip.It was an amazing experience that is well worth the money.

While in Marrakech and before embarking on a trip to South of Morocco, my friend and I took day trips to the neighboring destinations of Essaouira, Ourika Valley, and Ouzoud Waterfalls. We chose Rough Tours to drive and guide us on these days and we could not be happier and satisfied with our choice. Arrangements by email with Youssef was easy and simple. The day trips were scheduled consecutively to allow us to return to Marrakech each night, making the trips efficient and 'luggage-free'.On each of these days, Youssef arrived on time at our accommodation with an enthusiasm and bright outlook for the day that made us feel excited for the day's adventure. The road trips averaged two to three hours one way but they never seemed long as Youssef shared his seemingly vast knowledge of the countryside, the destination of the day, and Morocco's unique history and culture. We enjoyed his hilarious stories and interactions that the trip became as much a learning experience as a relaxed sightseeing one.Worthy to note that Rough Tours' standard travel philosophy includes the ability to be reasonably flexible on demand: Our changes to schedules were \"no problem\" at all; on a few occasions, requested stops to take in the views, take photos, beverage breaks, and the inevitable bathroom pit stops: - all in good time, no pressure!Throughout these day trips, Youssef provided not only his expertise and knowledge, but a genuine warmth and interest to enhance our travel experience: the superior service was in the details.As we travelled south in the days that followed, we would count on Rough Tours again to expertly guide us through the labyrinth of Morocco's regional cultures and varied topographies. As expected, its team of equally engaged guides consistently delivered and made our many journeys some of the great experiences of our life.As we did, you can confidently entrust your holiday, memories and discoveries/adventures to Rough Tours!"

Youssef being on a tour himself took the time to ensure our safety and rearrange our trip. Youssef, the drivers and guides in typical Berber style went over and beyond to ensure our trip was the most memorable experience. Even when we were flooded in at Ouarzazate as were many others, Youssef ensured we got on a plane to Marrakech with a guide and transport at the other end, even though it was 1 am.

My husband and I were collected from our Riad promptly at 9am by our guide Youssef and our driver, who were both very polite and welcoming. As we started our trip towards the Atlas mountains Youssef had a wealth of interesting information and history about Marrakech. Our driver stopped at several excellent viewing areas for us to take photos as we drove through the lovely Berber villages. We arrived at the Atlas mountains around 11am and trekked the mountain with the excellent guidance of Youssef, which probably took around 20 minutes, I would say you do need to be pretty fit for this part of the trip and wear a good pair of suitable walking shoes! But when you do reach the top the view and the waterfall is amazing! We rested there for a while with a lovely mint tea before making our way back down to the village below for lunch, where we sat on a roof terrace and enjoyed a 3 course lunch for under \u00a310! We then began our journey back to Marrakech stopping along the way for an optional camel ride (price was not included in the trip) but was well worth it, great experience! The day was amazing as were our two guides! I would definitely recommend Rough Tours for an exceptional and memorable day! Good price for having your own personal guide.

            "review": "Ouzoud Waterfall Day Trip From Marrakech. My wife and I are visiting Morocco from Canada and took the day trip to Ouzoud Waterfall with RoughTours yesterday (November 19).We were picked up directly from the riad we have been staying at by Ismael, a well-spoken and informative guide (albeit quiet at first). Our driver was a mild-mannered and often jovial Ibrahim. Ibrahim himself didn't speak much English, but he was very courteous and friendly.Our trip to the falls took about two and a half hours from the heart of the medina in Marrakech. Along the way, Ismael opened up a bit once he got a feel for our temperaments. He is very well educated as you will most probably find out for yourself. He is quite knowledgable about the various nuances of Moroccan life, especially that of Berber culture as he himself is Berber.On the road to the falls, you can expect to see an ever-changing landscape. From arid desert to fertile plains, then eventually to the verdant mountains which ultimately act as the home of the waterfall itself. Fortunately, Ismael is well-versed in the history and current inner-workings of each of the places on route. We had a quick stop at a cafe about halfway which afforded bathrooms and something to drink and nibble on for those so inclined.On arrival to the waterfall itself, you'll have the opportunity to take photos from the top and will have your choice of route down the the bottom. Either direction seemed to offer a number of opportunities for some nice photos, although undoubtedly you'll opt to take more from the bottom.On the trail down (we took the dirt path route, not the paved), Ismael described the historical sigificance of the caves dotting the inner walls of the valley surrounding the waterfall, particularily with regards to how the locals would climb precariously to use them for storage of their valuables (to me, seemingly similar to how sea birds use cliffside caves for their eggs).At the bottom, you'll find more rustic versions of the Maid of the Mist (like Niagara Falls), where they'll offer to row you out a little closer for a \"better\" photo op; however you're probably better off skipping it altogether if your sole intent is to get photos. I found that even at a decent distance away at the bottom, the spray was enough to cause a bit of havoc on the lens - only exascerbated by the midday sun peeking over the top (although it was stunning to look at).Once we had our photos from the bottom, Ismael asked us if we wanted to stop for lunch, which we were good with. We had chicken tagine and skewers with water - came out at about 150 dirhams with a tip. Ismael left us during lunch to take in the view before rejoining us when we were ready to proceed back up.By the time we were headed back, my wife and I were both pretty groggy and were able to sleep for a good portion of the road back to the city, save for a couple of nasty bumps that woke us from our respective slumbers.All in all, Ismael was very accomodating and friendly, and in our opinion, you'd do well to be paired with him. For what you get, the tour is reasonably priced and we would recommend this tour to anyone thinking about getting away from the chaos of the city for a day and taking in a beautiful natural atmosphere."

If all you want is to see the big cities, any guide and tour company will do... But, if you want to see the real country of Morocco and know the people, most of whom are of Berber origin, Rough Tours is the company for you! With Youssef and his associates, we were able to share time in rural homes and nomadic tents. We discovered there are two Moroccos...the rude, money grubbing cities where locals seem only interested in tourist dollars, and the countryside, where people are genuine and warm and where hospitality exists. We feel we saw the real Morocco because of the efforts of Youssef. We met him through Trip Advisor as a five star, high rated tour guide and feel that we left him as a warm personal friend. Even though the name of the company is Rough Tours, our adventure was comfortable and pleasant at all times."

As a family we have travelled extensively and the quality of the service we experienced I don't think we\u2019ve seen before.We chose a full day private trip to Ourzazate from Marrakech and were met by Youssef the MD of Rough Tours at our hotel. The journey through the High Atlas Mountains was stunning with plenty of short stops en route for photography and refreshments. Youssef shared his passion for his country and knowledge in a very engaging way. Travelling with two kids aged 9 and 6 we were anxious as to how they would cope but needn't have worried \u2013 Youssef involved them in the conversation from the outset. Our first stop was Ait Ben Haddou which we approached via a desert track \u2013 the kids loved the off road driving. This is a spectacular reconstructed Kasbah and in itself worth the long drive to reach it ( around 3 hours from Marrakech). After an hour here we drove on to Ourzazate and finally to Fint Oasis. This was the highlight for kids \u2013 off road driving through a river ! It was a very long day \u2013 12 hours, of which probably 8 were driving, but brilliant. Youssef is the kind of guide who makes you want to come back to Morocco to use his services again. I couldn't recommend him and the services of Rough Tours more highly. He even arranged for a driver to pick us up a couple of days after our trip and drop us at the airport.Outstanding in every respect."

We booked on-line and received email conformations prior to arriving in Morocco. Our Riad made contact with Youssef about collecting us, as we were hidden away in the north side of the Medina. Even though it was a long drive there and back in the day. Our guide's English was also very good and we discussed many things, while Ali focused on the driving. Throughout Morocco this is quite usual, very friendly, very kind. Essaouira is a small city in the Atlantic Coast. As a couple with a private tour we felt at ease during our day trip. This we felt was a better way to see a little more of Morocco, without the need to jump on and off coaches and staying with the crowd. Thank you Hassan and Ali our guides for the day, also to Youssef for organising everything in advance."

He was knowledgeable, spoke English fluently, but was just a pleasure to be with. I truly enjoyed not only the sites and his explanations, but just learning a bit about him and his family bacground. My only regret was that we only had a day with him. I'd love to tour the desert with him, and they would be the first group I'd call on my return to Morocco.I also wanted to comment on the flexibility and professionalism of Rough Tours. I accidentally mixed up the dates, and when Rough Tours arrived on the day I had indicated (but not the day I had wanted), they were very understanding and immediately offered to refund our deposit, no questions asked. This was above and beyond, and speaks volumes about their integrity and their dedication to customer service/satisfaction. Also, unlike other tours in Morocco, there were no unrequested stops for shopping, etc. All in all, these guys are great, and I'd wholeheartedly recommend using them."

Morocco is a country of contrast, one side you have the Mediterranean and the other you have the Atlantic Ocean, then you have the Ergs of the Sahara dotted with oases, towering above all that are the High Atlas Mountains. It is nothing to experience a sand storm, floods and then snow on the High Atlas all in one week as we did, such diversity. The indigenous Berber people are generous, hospitable with great sense of fun and humour. Our tour guide Ismail and driver Ibrahim were passionate about their country, history, imparting their knowledge, keeping us safe, ensuring we had an unforgettable holiday showing us the treasures of Morocco. We were lucky enough to have a glimpse of traditional life as we were invited into family homes along the way.Youssef was responsive and flexible offering a variety of options for our tours and our day trips. You could never tire of visiting Morocco and Roughtours are the people to show you their fantastic country. I thoroughly recommend Roughtours"

While in Fez we had \"back of house\" tours for a mosaic business, a tannery, rugs, a bakery and a honey-maker. Truly personalized and spontaneous. We also went to a hammam and loved it! The food was fantastic, from the tagine, Berber pizza and fresh seafood in Essaouira, to the pastries, almond cookies and refreshing mint tea. The level of care to detail and the wealth of information and passion for Morocco and its culture and people was priceless. Hands down, the best tour I've ever experienced.

During our desert trip he took care of us when we were sick (with local remedies and herbs!), made sure we had enough water, showed us how to wrap our turbans in the traditional way before we stepped on the camels, and made sure that we had regular stops for special photos. He told us hilarious stories about daily life in this part of the world, and engaged with us in fascinating discussions about the culture, politics and history of Morocco. He even took us to have tea with a charming nomad family. We were greeted with warmth by the people in the desert camp we stayed in, and our trek through Erg Chebbi on camels was unforgettable.

A friend who lives in the Middle East and I visited Morocco in early June and after a few days in the coastal resort town of Oualidia, we made a quick trip to Marrakech. As it was my friend\u2019s first visit to Morocco, I was eager to show a bit more of my favorite destination. As time was a constraint, I called on Rough Tours again to provide us with a day tour out of Marrakech to Ouarzazete as my friend was a film buff. Youssef, manager of RoughTours, very quickly arranged for a car and a very pleasant guide Moha, to take us on what turned out to be a long but comprehensive discovery day of that region. Ouarzazete is a modern and tourist-friendly town. It has wide boulevards and plenty of hotels and restaurants. The highlights of this day trip were a quick tour around the Atlas Film Studio where hundreds of films were developed and an off road drive to a UNESCO World Heritage Site \u2013 the picturesque old Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou - also a popular film location (The Gladiator). As a bonus, Moha, took us to the Taourirt Kasbah just outside of Ouarzazete. A well preserved (recently restored) historic building containing rich traditional interiors. A Berber village was close by to this Kasbah. My friend was amazed that in one day, we had seen, explored and learned so much of the Moroccan history, culture and traditions \u2013 thanks to Moha\u2019s inexhaustible knowledge and patience.More impressive was how well organized and efficient the day trip was as executed by this dependable and professional tour company. I wanted to impress my friend with the beauty of Morocco \u2013 I accomplished this but could not have done it without Rough Tours. Thanks again Youssef and Moha for another unforgettable Morocco express outing."

This was so interesting to see the culture & the fact that this family had basically nothing and were offering us things was overwhelming. There was the cutest 6yr old girl present and I wish we had brought something to give her like a colouring book or something. The hike included in this was the Ourika valley waterfall, which is quite steep trek, including some rock climbing & stream hopping. It was so breathtakingly beautiful.

Rough Tours was neither the least nor the most expensive but I chose them because Youssef was so responsive and helpful from beginning to end, because they do not take their customers to places just to get commissions, as many tour companies do, and because they give a donation for each tour to schools for Amazir, or Berber, children. Yes, the trip to the dessert was unforgettable and it's delightful to have all of the details of the trip managed by people who know the country so well. You get to just relax and enjoy the ride. But the part I didn't anticipate, and perhaps it was the best part, is that you learn so much about the history and the culture behind what you're seeing, more than you will ever learn from the guide books and internet. Our driver Ibrahim and guide Ismail became our friends. They answered OUR questions and were so knowledgable about everything from ancient history to current events, biology to geology, music to food, everything. They tailored the trip to our interests. Right from the start, Ismail said it was our trip and if we wanted to stop or change the itinerary, just let him know. When my son had to delay our start one day to respond to a work situation, it was no problem. When we got caught behind a traffic accident on the last day, rather than skimp on our tour, we just arrived later, making their work day end at 8:30 instead of 6:30. I was sad to say goodbye at the end of the tour. It was a wonderful, fun trip with two kind, thoughtful, generous, knowledgable young men, who generously taught us a great deal about their culture and their country. And what a country!"

The \"other\" Youssef was particularly helpful in working with us, via online and SKYPE, to plan and choose."

Our driver Achmed was excellent and lots of fun. Our guide Ismail was very knowledgeable and passionate about the country. RTs were flexible enough to accommodate all our needs and nothing was too much trouble for them. Their prices are very reasonable, they are generous and empathetic with their customers, and most of all they know how to give visitors to Morocco a fun, informative and memorable holiday. I recommend Rough Tours to anyone who wants to experience the real Morocco."

As I was when I recently went on yet another visit coinciding with a holiday in Europe. As a solo female travelling in Morocco, I once again entrusted my comfort, safety, and enjoyment to an \u2018old and tried\u2019 travel companion \u2013 Rough Tours. On this recent visit, Rough Tours proved once again that their team of guides and drivers are professional, expert travel providers who are fully engaged with delivering a high caliber of service that is consistently responsive, heartfelt and fun. As I was travelling around, Rough Tours designed a variety of activities and sightseeing that showcased the diversity of Morocco\u2019s cultural landscape \u2013 with thoughtful consideration to my time frame, interests, and budget. From the initial planning of my itinerary that involved many revisions to include places I have not visited before, to the choices of accommodations, and spontaneous wonderful moments and photo ops along the way, my Rough Tours guide and driver took care of details and inevitable complications of solo travel in unfamiliar territory. As a result, my journey became a collection of fascinating experiences, amazing memories and thousands of photos!\u201cOne\u201d is never travelling alone when a Rough Tours guide is on the driver\u2019s seat."

He truly is a gem, so full of information and so happy to answer all of our questions. We chose the deluxe tour and were blown away. The airconditioned 4x4 was extremely comfortable for the four of us and all of our luggage. The hotels and camp site were extremely nice and fancy. My partner and I have been travelling for one year and this tour was by far the best tour we have ever been on. We know a few people going to Morocco and have been highly recommending this company to our friends. Thanks guys, you really made our desert tour FANTASTIC!!!!!!!"

I usually take good or bad reviews with a grain of salt; but I am happy to report that Youssef and the rest of the Rough Tours Team exceeded every expectation I could have had.We didn't have a lot of time in Marrakech, so we booked a one day excursion to Ouzoud Falls in the Atlas Mountains. Youssef was awesome from the first email; responding almost instantly to all of my multitude of questions. After booking the tour, I realized that they also did airport transfers. As a couple of single females we were slightly concerned about finding a safe, hassle free ride to our hotel, Rough Tours provided the answer with a VERY reasonable price. They not only were waiting in the arrivals area with our name on a sign, but they even stuck around to ensure that we were safely checked-in to our hotel.The Ouzoud Excursion was perfect. It's a bit of a drive into the mountains but Ishmial (not sure on the spelling) and Youssef had a clean, comfortable vehicle for us, stopped when ever we needed and kept us entertained/informed without being annoying. The Falls were beautiful and there was a great taste of the local culture to be had. Watch out for the boats if you decide to go swimming ;)I would give Rough Tours six stars if I could."

I highly recommend using Rough Tours if you are planning to visit Morocco. Before our trip , Youseff was quick to reply to emails, answering questions and helping with planning. When we arrived at Morocco, we met our guide ,Said, he was waiting with a smile, and bottles of ice cold water!! I can not say enough about Said, he was very knowledgeable and upbeat, and spoke excellent English. because of the language barrier, I was nervous about this trip, but Said took care of everything,. The camel ride and night in the desert were amazing!! Plus, we had some, off the beaten path experiences, which gave up a real insight into the country and the people. Both my son and i had an amazing time on our trip, and i think a large part of that was due to Rough Tours. Now that we are home, we both miss our guide, Said!! If you are going to Morocco, I recommend Rough tours for all your excursions."

We usually book all trips independently as we are frequent travellers, but were really glad that we took the tour option. Having our own guide and driver worked very well, and we did not feel part of an anonymous package. Adil , our driver, was excellent and drove safely and carefully throughout. Our guide, Mustafa, was helpful and informative when we wanted him to be, but was a good travelling companion who didn't talk at us relentlessly . The hotels were of good standard, and the night in the desert was more thrilling than we had anticipated as we were caught in a sandstorm. We later met people who had taken the self drive option, and after their tales of being stopped by the police and of attempting to drive in the evening on the mountain roads, we were glad that we chose the option of an organised trip"

I can't recommend Rough Tours highly enough - the four of us booked a day trip to the Atlas Mountains stopping off at Atlas studios, Ouarzazate and Ait Ben Haddou and from the first communication Youssef was brilliant - the day was fantastic: it's a long trip; 11 hours in total but well worth it for the stunning scenery you pass through to get to the sites. Youssef picked us up from our villa early and spent time telling us many interesting things about our trip and the places we visited; he also arranged guides at the studios (a surreal experience but great fun) and Ouarzazate (a hilarious Berber guide showed us around the ancient palace of the Pasha) and then guided us himself at Ait Ben Haddou, a remarkable 11th century Berber town - if you're a fan of Game of Thrones you might recognise it....Then it was back home through more stunning landscape and a hair-raising but hugely fun spot of off-roading courtesy of Youssef. His kindness and helpfulness knows no bounds - once he found out we were heading home to the UK the following day he immediately insisted he would pick us up and take us to the airport and refused to take any payment - what a delightful man!Do yourselves a favour: book a trip with Rough Tours - and make sure you ask for Youssef to be your guide!"

His team even picked us up at the airport for no fee and helped us when the airline lost our bags. Our trip to Ourikka was a highlight of our Moroccan adventure. We learned about the Berber culture, hiked to a beautiful waterfall and had a fun lunch all while laughing and having fun. And Youssef was kind enough to take us to 2 Marrakech sights with our extra time! His team even bought us bus tickets to get to Essaouira and provided a ride to the bus station instead of trying to upsell us to pay for a car trip. Youssef loves what he does and it shows. His family runs their business with passion and integrity. They even run a Berber school and charity. I'm glad to now call him a friend. Roughtours is the best way to see Morocco!

I had an unhealthy amount of anxiety while planning this trip because there are so many tour companies to choose from and at such a variety of prices.Mostly I was stressed because i knew being a solo female traveler going deep into the desert could be risky if not on the right hands.I must have contacted 9 tour companies and here is why Thankfully I chose Roughtours.:1. Communication was instant and frequent with Youssef, the manager.2. He and his family built a school for children and their families called Friends if the Nomads and part of my fee will go directly to this cause.3. While most wanted money wired and other funky things, Youssef allowed Paypal for payment(a small and fair fee tacked on) enabling me to use Amex.4. He meant what he said and he doesn't take you anywhere that gives him a commission if you buy a souvenir.5. He was very responsive to accommodating my agenda and not his and while he offered advise, he respected it was my trip.6. Clean, air-conditioned 4 by 4 and other vehicles if needed.7. And here is what sealed the deal for me, i can't live without Wifi access and it was important to me to know I could update family to let them know I was okay. Roughtours knows every spot on the road and beyond that offers wifi! They will even charge your phone en route!I was relieved the minute I met Youssef at my riad to pick me up for the tour. He knew I was nervous so he was kind enough to tell me that he would personally be my guide into the desert. He drove all the way from Casablanca to get me.He was friendly, knowledgeable and full of fun. I felt secure and taken care of at all times. Phew!The ride into the desert was magical, spectacular, extremely well run and well planned and Roughtours chose the kindest people to take us in the camels and into the desert and have a glimpse into the Berber culture.It takes a village for a trip to go smoothly and Rough tours planned seamlessly and has a great rapport with villagers in the different stops. It felt like family even to me!I am quite taken by Morocco and all its culture beauty intensity and rush to all five senses whether in the hectic stalls of Marrakesh or seeing the sunset in the middle of the quietest mist serene sunrise I have ever experienced.For sure Morocco is different than most places I have travels in the world as a solo traveler in that I was very dependent upon the guides I hired for various day trips and such. This trip was made by a combination of a great attitude on my part to open myself up to the world but I couldn't have done any if that without the genuine good-hearted Roughtours. I am forever changed and grateful that I had this experience.It could have gone a whole other wrong way, had I not been in such good hands."

We were picked up at our hotel and met by Mbarek in an extremely comfortable Toyota 4Runner. This was our home away from home as set out on a fantastic journey with Rough Tours.One thing that I can tell you both from reading other reviews (which is how we found them originally) and from our experience is that there tour is centered around GOOD HUMOR! These guys are quick with a smile, a story and a joke - it makes the adventure that is Morocco feel personal and welcoming. We even found out one of the brothers who work with the company lived about 10-blocks away from us in New York and made a quick trip to meet him where we chatted about life \"back home\"!The highlight of our trip was heading out to the dunes. We headed out to the desert near the Algerian border where we mounted camels and headed 2 hours into the dunes. The night we were in the desert, there was a meteor shower making the vast, clear skies all the more amazing and magical. YOU MUST DO THIS!!!Every step of the tour is tailored, safe and thoughtful. Following our visit, the team followed up with us to see if we had any feedback and make sure that we got home safely. The sense of customer service combined with the attention to detail was positively amazing. Their rates are very reasonable considering that you have a private tour, your breakfast and dinner are provided. It is very apparent why they are so highly rated."

Their knowledge on what to do if you have little time was spot on and we were incredibly well looked after every step of the way. They made checking in and out of places very easy. During our trip to Essaouira they also helped us organise a hammam and massage experience that we tried to do ourselves, but failed, in Sidi Kaouki and on our request, they helped us organise a fish BBQ at our riad one evening and in Marrakech they ensured that we found the restaurant we were looking for safely and picked us up again. I have been very impressed with the whole experience and they made the whole trip easy and relaxing with nothing for us to worry about. I can certainly recommend them, not only for the professional service, but also for the great value for money."

I found rough tours through the great reviews on tripadvisor (obviously) and whatever I say here really won't do the service and organisation from this fantastic tour company justice - but here goes. From my initial contact to the final goodbye i couldn't fault a thing. I sent many emails to Youssef to get the final itinerary and dates that suited us best (54 wasn't it Youssef) and he always responded promptly with his own helpful suggestions. Our tour included, Marrakech, Ourzazate, Dades Valley, Ramlia (a trip deep into the desert to a local village and not to be missed), Erg Chebbie (great experience of afternoon camel safari into the desert and overnight in berber tents), Fes and Chefchouen. The only thing we would do differently if we had our time over would be to spend at least an extra day in Fes and Chefchouen as they were our favourite city and town.Our guide Hassan and our drivers (Mohammed, Salim, & another Youssef) were fantastic and very helpful. Hassan's english was great and his insights into the country and the places we visited was so helpful. He had a great sense of humour and very, very accommodating of our many request for photos or other demands we may have placed on him. Am I getting my messge across here - they were awesome in every way and my wife and I and our two friends will never forget our first trip to Morocco thanks to Rough Tours. Looking forward to returning.Also the accommodation organised by Rough Tours along the way far exceeded our expectations, beautiful authentic Riads with friendly, helpful staff & great breakfasts and dinners where they were included.As well as everything else another great advantage was the exclusive tour for the 4 of us and that we could have a flexible start date and itinerary If you want to see more detail of our our trip with Rough Tours you can check it out at our travel blog - fabtraveller.com"

We normally don't use tour companies and just travel on our own -- but Morocco seemed a little more challenging than Europe or other parts of Asia we've visited. I didn't see any published tours that had exactly what I wanted, but after reading a review on TripAdvisor about Rough Tour's flexibility, I contacted them with what I was looking for. Youssef Boughrara was able to suggest a 10 day itinerary that met all of our needs: Casablanca, Fes, Meknes, Volubilis, camel ride into the desert, Dades, Ouarzazate, and Marrakech. We also included a night in the tiny desert village of Ramlia -- so far off the beaten path for your typical American tourists -- and a real treat.Youssef and I emailed back and forth a few times, finalizing dates, pick-up times and intinerary. His responses were always prompt. The deposit was very minimal -- which seemed strange. But all was delivered as promised.Our driver - another Youssef -- and our guide Hassan were delightful. Hassan's English was excellent and he provided interesting commentary and insight into where we were going and what we saw. Rough Tours provided local official guides in several of the places we visited -- and they were wonderful. Especially Farida (spelling?) in Fes.Rough Tours arranged all of our lodging -- generally in charming riads, well located within the cities we visisted. We really enjoyed the riads: the lovely decor, personable owners and staff, the delicious breakfasts provided, the occasional meals we chose to eat at the riads, and chatting with other guests.I approached this trip very differently than most of our family trips -- allowing Rough Tours to guide the way and we were very pleased. Normally we are rather uptight about time schedules and I am a stickler for managing all details! On this trip, I tried to just \"go with the flow\". That worked well and there were only a couple times where I had wished I had asked a few more questions ahead of time. (Example -- we were on our own visiting Meknes, but I didn't realize this until we arrived in the city and had I grabbed the wrong guide book. We still enjoyed our stroll through the city and the mausoleum of Moulay Ismail, but I felt that I should have realized we wouldn't have a guide here. If I had asked more questions, I could have been more prepared.) But the vast majority of the trip \"flowed\" without incident.A word on distances -- there was a lot of car time on this trip: Fes to Merzouga, Merzouga to Ramlia (4x4 off-road - Bumpy!!), Ramlia to Dades, Dades to Marrakech. The scenery was lovely and ever changing, but that did make for a few long days. The maps make the distances look shorter -- but the roads through the mountains and deserts are not super highways! However, we saw the wide variety of cities and had the great experiences we wanted. And our driver and guide were wise to have us stop frequently to see a beautiful view and stretch our legs or enjoy a leisurely lunch.I highly recommend Rough Tours for a vacation in Morocco!"

            "review": "Brilliant. We did 2 day trips, the first one to Essaouira. Any questions we had were answered with relaxed confidence and a sense of humour. The harbour was wonderful and we felt we were transported back in time. After a very good \"fish lunch\" the four of us headed back. I could go on in great detail, but suffice to say that this trip is well worth doing. A completely different Morocco.The second trip was to the Ourika Valley. On the way we encountered a tree full of goats (!) and stopped off at a Berber family's house. Very very interesting and touching how they look after each other. Finished off with tea, freshly baked bread, butter and honey and pleasant conversation. Only to be toped by our guide Hasnouni who seemed to have all the answers. Onwards to the Atlas mountains and a little walk to higher regions. Unfortunately the rains had not materialized this year, so it was not as green as usual, but still impressive. I'll keep the next chapter short: I slipped, broke my ankle, Hasnoini piggy backed(!!) me down in very difficult conditions, Youssef, the driver, did a \"Michael Schuhmacher\" and took us to hospital. They stayed with us, translated when necessary, got me even a prescription and even came back later that evening to see if everything was ok. Wow! Without them it would have been a nightmare. So as you can see, I was more than very well looked after. They treat you as an individual and not just a number. One regret is that I didn't do the a longer tour, but there is always next time!So if you want interesting, exciting, different and fun then go with them!"

I personally don't like to do tours, but since this was our first time in Morocco and since it was only 3 of us and our guide, Said, I decided to give RoughTours a try, and I am very glad I did. Said gave us great insight into the political, natural, and historical side of Morroco. We went to spectacular Kasbah's, and took an amazing camel ride with a spectacular sunset, not to mention the sand-boarding, star gazing(best ever), tajine dinner in a Berber tent(delicious), traditional singing around the camp fire(even I took up the dums), and teaching each other new games in the Sahara desert. What an experience!"

Rough Tours were as good as all the publicity which pointed us to them in the first place: they really do have a feel for the culture of Morocco.The icing on the cake for my wife was having Youssef as our driver/guide - \" a lovely young man\" she thought.

At first, we were a little skeptical because all of the reviews of this tour company on TripAdvisor were almost too good to be true. However, the trip that this tour company organized for us was really just that perfect and so much more. We had Hassan as our guide and Youssef as our driver. Both were extremely professional and Hassan was very knowledgeable about Moroccan culture and history. We loved every single city we visited, including Marrakech and Fes. Hassan even took us to his village and we got to visit his family and experience true Moroccan hospitality.The definite highlight of the trip was overnight camp in the desert so make sure to include that as part of your itinerary. We rode camels into the camp and were able to watch the beautiful sunrise and sunset from the dunes - just WOW! Youssef, the owner of the company, perfectly arranged the entire trip for us. He was flexible in arranging the tour based on all the cities we wanted to visit and booked us really beautiful riads. As 3 female travelers, we always felt safe and comfortable. The greatest thing about this tour company is that they donate a certain percentage of the profits to Friends of Nomads, a charity that tries to help promote literacy for Berber children.I would not change a single thing about this trip - again it was just simply PERFECT!"

From the beginning I had great confidence as Youssef was extremely responsive (even with the time differences) and very accommodating and kind. We weren't disappointed on the morning of our trip when Hassan and (a different) Youssef the driver showed up. Hassan is an energetic and incredibly sweet person who truly seems to love his job. And with a degree in Literature, we had conversations I didn't expect to be having with our Moroccan guide--who knew we'd be talking about Ibsen's A Doll's House??? Both Hassan and Youssef were very relaxed and accommodating to whatever we wanted. I should note that this is less a \"tour\" than a \"drive\"--once in Essaouira you are just dropped off with an agreement to meet later, and then you explore on your own. This was perfectly fine for us but I note it only because some people might want more of a guided tour around town. In any case, I certainly recommend everything about Rough Tours, and ask for Hassan by name--you will be so happy to meet him!"

If you are looking for a non-ordinary and exciting moment in Morocco, I believe Rough Tours is your best choice.Guided by one of their professional and friendly guides, Youssef Bani, my boyfriend and I enjoyed our wonderful and memorable time in Morocco. We experienced our very first time exciting but safe off-the-road driving though the high, middle and low Atlas, we visited the true nomads and had a great tea time with them and we even enjoyed a stunning sunset on a sand dune with ONLY us! All of these exceeded our expectation and it is very good to have a funny guide who is also a photography enthusiast - most of the time we stopped impromptu just for amazing pictures!The most impressing thing is - Youssef never persuaded or brought us to buy anythings in any specified souvenir shops. Instead he advised us where to get the product(s) with the best price possible. They really treated their clients as friends, and that's how they stand out from the rest!Good job Rough Tours and Youssef!"

We have just returned from an excursion with roughtours, and we had simply a fantastic and memorable time!Note that when booking our holiday, roughtours made it possible to customise the things we did. All this was done via email.Accommodation was on the whole, very good. We stayed in several very nice riads, a nice guesthouse, a Berber camp, and a fancy hotel in the Dades Valley.Airport pick up and drop off was seamless. A guide was waiting in the arrivals point of the airport with our name on a card. They then took us to our riad, and we found chatting with them calmed any of our anticipatory nerves.There were numerous photo opportunities (they know where the pretty places are!) and were very accommodating if we specifically wanted to take some pictures in a particular place. Our guide, Said, and driver, Adi, became more like friends and so it was a pleasure to travel with them. They were able to answer all of our many questions about Morocco, covering culture/history/religion/nature/politics and more. (The only question Said couldn't answer was \"why does a donkey ee-ooor, and a horse neeeh?\"... but then again, that was a bad question.)Our particular Morocco travel points to note are:-- full payment for the holiday takes place once there (I guess this might change in the future), hence we were slightly apprehensive whether everything would work out okay when we arrived. As you might guess from this review, it all went very well indeed, and there was nothing to worry about.-- be confident in Marrakech. Market sellers will approach you, but try not to make too much eye contact and a firm \"No thank you\" while keeping on walking away, will see they move on.-- haggle for most things being bought. Try to start just under half their asking price, and negotiate from there. Also remember you don't have to buy anything! Keep things friendly (haggling is fun) and all is fine.-- the trip we did involved quite a lot of travelling in a 4x4 car. If you get severely motion sick, this could be a problem. I suffer slightly from motion sickness, but was fine. Also, just ask to slow down when in the moutains if you think you're going to throw-up.We feel a very important point to note is that our holiday was effortless on our part. Roughtours made the difficult things possible (e.g., travelling, arranging accommodation, walking with bags to various places, finding a place for lunch, etc.) yet left us feeling like we were still in control: we simply concentrated on having a great time! Of course, we could have organised this holiday ourselves, and considered it, but knowledge about a country with a very different culture to ours was something we couldn't gain via the internet only -- we're certain roughtours made fun what would have been difficult for us. Ultimately, our holiday was a pleasure!In summary -- excellent: we very highly recommend roughtours!"

I would definitely recommend this company for anyone who wants to see Morocco off the beaten path.

Said and Addi were not only very professional at their job but they were are also friendly, hospitable and loved to joke around. Right from the start of our road trip (tour) we felt like we were travelling with friends, as well as the end as they tried to give us a lift to the airport so we could have a last minute catch up (sadly we couldn't meet). We did the 5 day tour from the Atlas Mountains, Ramlia, Erg Chebbi sand dunes, Merzouga and Ouarzazette, but in between that there are a lot of extras like driving in the middle of nowhere in the desert with only the mountains to guide them, there's no GPS there! We also shared tea at Addi's father's house, visited Said's brothers house, stopped to share some tea with a Berber nomad out collecting fossils, as well as having a picnic in the desert and of course followed by more tea. Said and Addi are both proud Berbers and it shows they care deeply for their community and know just about everyone, as well as give them lifts to their village and in exchange eat some of their home grown dates.Rough tours is more than a tour company, they put back a lot to their community and that shows when we stayed at their guest house in Ramlia. The accommodation they provide was good value, it ranges from the luxury of the hotel in Dades, to the 'Rough' accommodation in the desert camp. What a few people haven't mentioned is the food, all the restaurants they took us to the food was delicious they range from a Berber pizza (my favourite) to a prune and almonds chicken tagine... The home cooked tagine in Ramlia was the best one we had in Morocco..and we had a few! We will miss our Berber friends, but we have fond memories of our tour and we got to see the diversity of Morocco, it's such a beautiful country and our friends there made the experience even better!"

I travelled in solo and originally, I was just looking for a driver to take me around. I connected with Rough Tours through a personal recommendation and after exchanging a few e-mails I decided to go with them. I didn't have time to organize all the details of my trip so I was very grateful that it was all taken care of and Rough Tours even personalized my suggested itinerary to include some highlights that I didn't think I would have time for! And what a trip I had, I couldn't have asked for more! It exceeded all my expectations and it was not just the beauty of the country that captivated me. I got to personally meet quite a few members of the Rough Tours team and I have to say that they are all very professional, kind, genuinely friendly and caring people. Nothing that I asked was turned down and most of the times I didn't even have to ask....as if the guys were reading my mind. One night we were on the road at sunset and I was just thinking how nice it would be to stop and take a picture. I just reached for my camera but said nothing and found out that the driver was already looking for a nice spot for me. Another great example was the accommodation Rough Tours booked for me in Essaouria. The only thing I asked was that I wanted to stay as close as possible to the ocean during my stay there. I was very happy to get a room in a riad that was right on the water, where the waves were hitting the wall of the building and in the evening the murmur of the ocean put me to sleep. But all my other accommodations I stayed at were superb as well!During my trip not only I saw many of Morocco's highlights but I got an insight knowledge of the country's history, traditions and everyday life by people who are very passionate about their job and their country. Rough Tours' mission is obvious, they work very hard (which seems effortless by the way) to keep their clients happy and make their trip a truly memorable, unforgettable experience!  And for the highlights.....sorry but there are too many and it's impossible to rank them. Go with Rough Tours and decide for yourself which one would be the highlight for you: wondering around Fes, getting lost in the narrow alleyways, sleeping under the million stars in the desert, rallying in the sand dunes with a 4x4, enjoying the spectacular scenery from Merzouga to Marrakech, shopping in the old souks, watching people passing by in the main square of Marrakech from a terrace or taking a break from the crowds and enjoying some fresh seafood in the relaxing town of Essaouria. I will always cherish the fond memories of this beautiful trip, thanks to Rough Tours!"

I mean, I dont usually get in contact with tour companies in order to enjoy a new country. But I have read their reviews and I asked myself, \"what is the deal about Rough Tours?\".... So I did it. And now I have great friends from Morocco. What I admire about these guys is that they know how to read people. I mean, imagine how the people they could get, from all over the world, everybody is different, different expectactions, but they are really good about knowing what a person is looking for. Well, I have a blast in Morocco thanks to Driss and Youssef, now I even want to host them in my country not even charging anything but just to show my culture to them in the say way they did to me. It was fun, it was great, it was amazing. Morocco was all that because of these guys, because of them. I just wish I could play the drums like Driss hahaha."

            "review": "Fantastic !. We used Youssef Boughrara from Rough Tours Company for our tour to the Atlas mountains and Fes. We start from Marrakech Ourikka valley . He is nice person, very knowledgeable about the area with very well maintained Toyota 4x4, that he drives very safely. He is very friendly, with excellent English speaking skills and generally made us feel like we were traveling with a friend. He set up our day trip through emails, offered several alternatives and suggestions and customized the day to our interests. We had a great visit to a Berber market, shopped a little, got some great fried fish and generally saw an interesting counterpoint to the souks of Marrakech. He arranged for a fantastic tagine lunch with a local family in the mountains, even having them prepare a second, egg tagine for our daughter who does not eat meat. Along the way he made stops at an oil and soap coop, an herb coop and some pottery spots, but only at our request, and we definitely felt neither pressured or that he was going to receive a kickback. Later in the week, he drove us from Marrakech to Fes. Because of bad weather (it poured), we elected to take the highway, but he made it interesting, by filling us in about culture and politics and finding a great lunch spot that was clearly a locals favorite. We only had a week in Morocco, so we couldn't do an extended Atlas Mt. / desert trip, but he would definitely be our first choice for any tour or transportation needs in Marrakech if we go back.\u00a0"

            "review": "A Day With RoughTours is A Good Day. While on safari in Kenya last September,I became nostalgic for a destination that had become a favorite \u2013 Morocco. Having visited the kingdom twice before, and with spare vacation days, I decided to rekindle my fascination of Morocco and discover more of its highlights if only for a few days. I have used RoughTours before on previous trips and had been extremely satisfied with their excellent service standards so to use them again was a no\u2013brainer. After a few exchange of emails with Youssef, he had come up with an itinerary that included a couple of day tours out of Marrakech which was going to be my base for five days. Youssef met me at the airport and it was like visiting old friends again. He was welcoming, friendly and attentive. My improbable list of what I wanted to do during my short visit was \u201cno problem\u201d at all. The traveller\u2019s wish list had never seemed to be a problem for RoughTours. The drive to the coastal town of Essaouira was entertaining as he regaled me with his anecdotes and sprinkled it with his usual sense of humor. His knowledge of this area is as comprehensive as of the Atlas Mountains and the desert area from where he came from. On my request, we stopped and I shopped at the Afous Argane Coop for some Argan products to take home and he later surprised me with a detour and showed me the flying goats (goats on Argan tree tops). In Essaouira, Youssef recommended a seafood restaurant that served an excellent fish tajine. Later, a short walk to the fishing harbour, the historic ramparts and finally to the colourful medina. It was a short but interesting discovery of a simple, yet charming resort town, a nice contrast to the mountains and desert.My other day tour was to the Ourika Valley but that\u2019s another great story made possible by a RoughTours guide. Morocco does not disappoint the traveler. But the right tour company can make a difference as it can take the stress out of planning logistics and allows you sit back, enjoy and just be fascinated and amazed. RoughTours is such company. See and experience for yourself."

There're lots of things wanted to see and do only for a week....then, my friend found Rough Tours thru tripadvisor. Youssef, who we didn't have chance to meet this time, responded to our e-mails so quick and clear. Through this corresponding we found they are professional whom we can rely on, yet the fee is reasonable. We took a 3-day tour from Fes to Marrakech. As soon as the tour started, we found our decisions to choose Rough Tour team were absolutely correct . Our guide, Ismail had a lot of knowledge and taught us a lot about Morocco and answered to all our questions, including silly ones and our driver Hassan, who was a really good driver. We were worried about getting carsick while we drive through the winding road of haut Atlas, but we totally forgot it and enjoyed. They were flexible and always tried to entertain us during the tour. Ismail, Hassan, thank you for making our trip an unforgettable and fascinating one!"

You can probably do your own research and book your own riads & guides for a bit less. But why deal with all that hassle? But there's a reason why Rough Tours has consistently been #1 on TA. It was our first visit to Morocco, and we were frankly overwhelmed with the information and options. Our concerns were: limited time, safety, reliability, and most importantly, a chance to see the country thru the eyes of true locals. RT delivered on each item. Youssef was great from the get-go on email communication, especially considering I had many questions and revisions to our itinerary. He was accommodating, gave great practical information, and was very prompt. During our trip, our guide Amed & our driver Salim, were consistently on time and always smiling. We felt 100% safe at every moment, and 0% hassled. Kudos to Salim, who was a topnotch driver. We especially enjoyed getting to know our guide, Amed, who became a new friend. Through his engaging stories, his music/poetry, his education & background (as a nomad & Amazigh), we felt like we experienced a genuine glimpse of true Morocco. If you want the typical touristy, cookie-cutter generic tourbus, \"sanitized\" version of Morocco, then Rough Tours is not for you. We wanted the gritty, honest, sensory overload version, and that's what we got. Thanks for making our first trip to Morocco so enjoyable, educational, authentic, and unforgettable!!"

He picked us up in a very nice and clean van and drove us through the Atlas cities; he listened to what we wanted to do, made suggestions, and made sure we had a great time.

Pros: Completely private, stopped wherever we wanted, no pressure to visit venues, air conditioned 4x4, good English, knowledgeable guide, beautiful locationsCons: Winding roads might get the car sick a little worse for wear (not Rough Tours' fault though, just a bit of advice!), seemed a little \"off\" about final cash payment (I didn't tip extra beyond the agreed amount, not sure if that's customary?)Marrakech is beautiful. But it's also famous for knock-off tour providers that'll drop you into all sorts of brother/cousin/uncle stores and \"force\" you to buy things. Not so with Rough Tours. When I first saw the website, I did scratch my head and wonder \"is this all legit?\". And I can confirm that it absolutely is: there are no issues with the deposit via Paypal in advance and the email correspondence is also very good in setting things up as you require, right down to the hotel pick up. The standout thing is that the tour - whichever you choose - is private. An air-conditioned 4x4 all to yourself with one driver and one guide for our day tour to Ourika Valley in the Atlas mountains (the guys also do longer tours for days or even a week, but I didn't have the time for such an excursion). No pressure from other tour-goers, no problems to stop and take pictures wherever you like. You can even pick whether the radio is on or off, or what to listen to. Perfect. It'll cost a little more than some other providers, but I think that the exclusivity provided was more than worth it. Be warned that the roads to Ourika Valley are rather winding though, so the travel sick out there might want to bring some pills. But if it gets too bad there's no problem in stopping and no embarrasment as nobody else will be around!We knew the drill of where we'd be visiting in advance. Although I say there was no pressure to visit venues in the opening gambit of this review, part of the point of this tour was to see some of real Marrakech. We stopped off to get traditional mint tea - so take a cash tip - but that was something I really wanted to experience. Pleny of people will pass through that village with tour operators, but that's just the way things are done. Other venues that sold oil, for example, we weren't interested in visiting. Not a problem - straight back in the car and off we went, no questions asked.The waterfalls at Ourika valley are cooling and beautiful, though rather busy. The rocks are quite a challenge to climb up so you'll need to be able-bodied and wear sensible footwear. But also take flip flops in a bag so you can paddle without the stones digging into your feet. It's really refreshing in the summer heat. As much as I tend to avoid tours and prefer to do things on my own, there's no way it'd be possible to do what we did without these guys. So when a tour becomes essential to see the country I can't think of a better choice to make than Rough Tours. It opened up a wider area of Morocco to our trip, something that'll be memorable for a long time yet."

            "review": "Fantastic Day Trip, Professional and Friendly Guide. We took a day trip from Marrakech to the Ourika Valley in a very hot August, on a very busy day immediately following Eid.Making the arrangements, at the last minute, with Youssef, was straightforward and really quickly sorted. From when he turned up, on time, the next morning to introduce our guide and see us off, we couldn't have asked for a better experience.Youssef and his family have thought of everything and obviously take great care and pride in their choice of staff and the level of service they provide to their customers.Throughout the day we were well looked after, felt safe and secure (which is saying something on Moroccan roads!) and were able to relax and have a thoroughly good time accompanied by Mustapha who looked after us perfectly.I chose Rough Tours based on their excellent reviews here on Tripadvisor, which have now vanished, and I was sceptical that any company could be good enough to only get 5* reviews - but they proved to me that day that they are, and it's great to see that the standard is the same with their reviews now.Finally, I thought I was paying a premium to go with the best tour firm, not only did we receive excellent value for money, but talking to other people in our Riad afterwards, we actually paid less than them for equivalent trips and they received nowhere near the same standard of guide.Highly recommended and looking forward to using again."

I tried enquiring \u00a0on the #1 in tripadvisor(rough tours) and the price was quite reasonable but since they are based in marakech they want to drop us off in marakech instead of agadir. I know we can just take supra tours from marakech to agadir, but with stuff like my wife's, and since this is our first time in morocco, we would prefer not to take bus. I tried other operators but either they are twice the price of rough tours, or they dont want to finish in agadir.I looked further in the list in tripadvisor and i came across sahara tours 4x4 and asked. Hassan replied very quickly on most of our conversations, \u00a0mostly during late nights and even very early morning. I gave him \u00a0my preferred itenerary and we agreed on the price. He is not the cheapest, but with the flexibility we required we thought it was cheap enough. He even picked us up in marakech airport, took us to money changer, and grocery store.We started in marakech, then to ourzazate, dades valley, merzouga where the dunes are, back to ourzazate, then to agadir. We enjoyed the trip a lot and we felt safe. Hassan is very trustworthy. We usually leave all our things in the car. He is a bit joker which is good when you are on the road for days.He is not the #1 in tripadvisor simply because he hasnt got that many reviews not because he hasnt got enough clients, but because his previous clients are not leaving comments. If your looking for a guide in morocco, id say drop him and email and im sure you can work something out."

Me and my family did a trip to Morocco where we managed to see both imperial cities and Sahara desert. Our trip was organized by Roughtours team whom we like to thank a lot for their assistance and patience with our many questions before the trip took place.Also,the Tripadvisors.Youssef was really helpful and even if he did not lead the tour, he provided us with one of his qualified guide, Ismail, who was that knowlegeable of his culture and the history of all the monument we passed by. This review is mostly about Erg chebbi which is really a fantastic attraction I 've ever been to. Youssef and his experienced team made everything more than what we were expecting. The surprising thing was that my kids felt so active and delighted to touch and play in the golden sand dunes and even when we wanted to leave Merzouga they were sad and unhappy,for they are already fell in love with the nature and the gorgeous dunes of Erg chebbi.Our camel trek was so exceptional and I am looking already forwards for another experience. Riding between the dunes while the sun is going to set was that increadible.To be safe on a camel,Moha gave us some advice on how to ride and and be well balanced at the top of this desert animal.Also, a short listen on how to wear the Berber turbon. After one hour and a half we arrived to our private camp;another surprise for us as everything was well organised and even it was a good opportunity for the kids to play sandboarding. Immediately after checking our tents that were well equipped with mattresses and blankets, we climbed the next highest dunes to enjoy and pick up pictures of the amazing sunset . I can not really explain how much my kids enjoyed that night. While being in Morocco we observed that before any meal is served, the first thing we got was tea with mint or ' Berber whiskey' as they call it. And this was the case in the camp. After having dinner, typical tajine, our guide and the camelman set up fire and started to play some Berber music and the kids in their turns danced with great excitement. Early morning,our guide called from the outside to get ready for the sunrise of which I do not have enough words to express my feeling towards the fantastic view. What really atractted my attention was the total calm in the camp and the surroundings. The kids once again started the day with sandboarding after I joined them as well. It was so enjoyable as it was my first time to board on the sand. After that we headed back to our hotel where we had our breakfast and warm shower and getting ready for the next day trip. All I can say is that our Sahara desert trip to Erg chebbi was a wonderful and an unforgettable one.We got lot of things from our Moroccan experience. Without any doubt, I am going back with my family to visit this fantastic desert in my next trip to Morocco and only with Rough tours team whom I highly recommend them to all travellers."

During our week based in a Riad near the Place El Fna in Marrakech, we booked 3 tours in the area surrounding Marrakech and a 4th daytrip excursion to Essouira, all with Arib Voyages, as recommended by our hotel. The weekly Berber market was a unique experience, with an immense variety of produce largely unknown to us. The Berber family provided us with a delicious lunch of tangine, coucous, salad and cool bottled water. We felt very safe during our 4 wheel drive excursion with splendid views of the mountains. At our request, Bashir drove out of his way so that we could buy a authentic berber rug at a local \u00ab\u00a0cooperative\u00a0\u00bb. We felt completely comfortable while enjoying riding on well-trained camels while accompanied by attentive personnel. Other tours included a guided tour of a coop producing various products based on argan oil, hiking in the mountains with our guide and a drive to an artificial lake when we could enjoy a bite at the lakeside restaurant. A colleague of Bashir provided us with return transportation to Essouira, where our local guide Ahmed showed us the port with its small fishing vessels and its well-kept boutiques and streets and alleys. We couldn't resist the impulse to take home a necklace from the local workshop shared by Jewish and Islam jewelers. The Essouira portion of the day finished in a restaurant where the owner was our host. The trips were very reasonably priced, even for us alone without other clients. The very comfortable vehicles were air-conditioned, almost new and obviously well-maintained. Bahir`s and Ahmed's sense of humour added a very special touch to these outings that we won't forget.Elke and Bryson"

So we wanted to pack a lot in as much as we could. There were 4 of us, so we decided to do the tour. The guide was Omar originally from the Western Sahara region. It was an all day tour starting at 09.00 am , but we didn't get off to a flying start as one of the party need to go to the money exchange. No problem for Omar who was very laid back and very helpful. We visited a women's co-operative in the 1st valley, and the ladies in the party had a go at extracting the kernels and grinding the oil. Also stopped off for some excellent mint tea by a riverside. The river was spectacular as there had been heavy rain the previous day, so it wS in heavy flood mode with fast torrents. We continued the climb, off road in a 4 x 4 and Omar took us to a Berber family in a 2nd valley where a traditional meal was cooked for us. We sat on the terrace having an excellent lunch of Moroccan salad, chicken taggine, couscous and fruit. Omar explained the cooking process to us and we saw the bread been cooked. What I didn't tell Omar was I was the only one of the 4 that did not like couscous, however the lady cooks it differently to our typical method of just adding boiling water, they steam it under the vegetables so it takes on their flavours. So I gave it a go, and I was glad I did, it was delicious. It was a shame that is was a dull day with the odd rain showers, but the views eating lunch were excellent. Omar answered all questions that we put to him, but after consuming that spectacular meal it was a quieter journey back the hustle and bustle of Marrackech. An excellent day, well worth the time to see something so authentic. Thank you Omar once again."

They did not skimp out on the experience just because I was one perons. Bachir was extremely knowledgable and answered all my questions about Berber life, the landscapes we saw and personal stories about his family. The meal at the Berber village was hands down the best meal I had during a 10 day stay in Morocco that was filled with great food.I highly recommend this tour as a way to get to see, learn and immerse yourself in more the local cultureAlso of note they just got brand new Land Cruisers...I think Bachir said they got them the week before my tour. They are very comfortable and safe!"

We did the Three Valley Tour as we decided to join our Scottish friends on this amazing adventure. We opted to check out the 'Farmers Market' and short camel ride which were both incredible and eye opening. Our guide was very helpful, kind and extremely knowledgable. The terrain was jaw dropping, even for me being from the Rocky Mountains. We opted to do the little hike to lunch which was the most rewarding meal I've ever had! And by far the best meal of the trip. We were welcomed with traditional and refreshing mint tea by the Berber family, taken outside to a gorgeous deck that was only accompanied by stunning panoramic views! We got to take our time, which was needed as we were all suffering from the best food coma! The drive through the valley's was unbelievable, breathtaking, gorgeous, beautiful, extreme at times, and unforgettable! Without a doubt, it is a MUST MUST MUST do while in Morocco!"

With stops at the Argan Cooperative where we met the women making the oil (and had a quick go!), drinking mint tea in a delightful cafe that was actually in the river so we had cool water swooshing around our feet, and then very privileged to eat lunch at a Berber family's house - authentic food, fantastic hospitality and views, we felt very lucky. The valleys themselves were beautiful, and a lovely peaceful contrast to mad Marakesh! The family who run these tours really made it for us and we will be returning to Morocco for more, but will only ever book with Arib Voyages from now on. Thank you!"

Omar was informative and accommodating, with no question being too much trouble for him to answer. The scenery was stunning, but it was being able to go and experience the sights and sounds of a Berber market and particularly the lunch in a Berber home way up in the high Atlas that made this a memorable day.

Bachir was kind and accommodating, patient, and very knowledgeable about the region. From giving us a through tour of a Berber family home, to offering to take our photo at the most scenic moments, to being honest with advice about not feeling pressured to make a purchase during our stops, to being exceptionally flexible about timing and side stops, and to even offering us to borrow his sunglasses cleaning cloth, his attention to detail and care was super apparent. It's clear he has a passion for the region and is excited about sharing it with others. I would recommend this tour to everyone! And I hope to one day come back with the same company to see the Sahara."

What a fantastic day trip to the 3 valleys of the Atlas Mountains!Bachir was an excellent guide, taking us first to (an optional) camel ride, then on to a local market. He showed us around the market, telling us more about how it worked and explaining that it's a weekly event, so people are buying/selling for the whole week ahead (choose a Monday trip if you want to see this). Waitrose this wasn't, but what a way to see, hear & smell the real Morocco. The rest of the day was spent driving into the 3 valleys and up (and off road) into the mountains. We stopped for mint tea by a stream (bachir made the best mint tea of our 2 week holiday!) and had lunch with a Berber family. We were warmly welcomed and shown around their home. Lunch was fantastic and we didn't need to eat again for the rest of the day, there was so much to eat!Bachir took us up and into the mountains. The views were stunning and he was happy to stop any time we wanted to take a photo. In fact, he was happy to adjust the tour in any way we wanted to. The whole tour was taken at a gentle and unhurried pace (Bachir allowed us to get out of the 4x4 in the afternoon to do some walking). This was the exact opposite of the usual bus tour trips that you find on most holidays. We made all the arrangements by e-mail before leaving the uk; messages were always answered quickly and helpfully. This was the highlight of our stay in Marrakesh. We wouldn't hesitate to book again with Arib Voyages; thoroughly recommended!"

What impressed me was their flexibility, and willingness to help beyond just the basics.For example we stopped at an ATM, had different pick up and drop off locations one day, and accommodated our desire to hike a bit and be out of the car on the 3 valleys trip. Their operation was smooth and professional, definitely made everything easy and enjoyable. We liked Bachir so much the first day, we asked if he could be with us the second day which he was. His friendly nature and positive attitude made us feel relaxed and comfortable each day.Also, for Essaouira, the Arib Voyages guide is not permitted to be with you in the City as there are specifically licensed guides there, however Bachir gave us lots of insight ahead of time and was right that you don't need a guide in Essaouira. I had also priced hiring a private driver for this trip which was more expensive than what Arib charged for this trip. Overall, very satisfied and would strongly recommend their operation, and Bachir especially!"

It was great sitting up front with Bachir and chatting away - he was so friendly, polite and great company. The day trip was a great antidote to the hustle and bustle of the Medina. We stopped at a Berber family house for lunch which was delightful - great food and a lovely family with stunning views from the dining area. At the end of our day I asked if Bachir could drop us at the Jardin Majorelle as we wanted to do a quick visit and he very kindly insisted on waiting for us then returning us to our Riad which was not necessary or expected but extremely helpful and saved us getting fleeced by the local taxis! And then on the way back to the Riad he stopped a tuk-tuk driver and negotiated a fair rate and a timetable for the following day when we wanted to visit various places around Marrakech. So helpful Bachir, we truly were very thankful for your help and graciousness. Cannot recommend Arib Voyages highly enough and we're looking forward to returning to Morocco and booking another tour with them! Thank you :-)"

We were a group of 11 adults and 5 children. They came to pick us up from the riad, and being a large group of course we were running behind and they waited for us patiently. We went on our excursion in 3 new 4x4s and each of the drivers/guides was super knowledgable and spoke different languages to a accommodate all members of our group. They were also so nice to tailor the excursion to our group since we had a few older people and children. I cannot speak highly enough of the service and politeness of these men. The excursion itself was amazing, I have been to the outskirts of Marrakech several times and this by far was the best excursion, they knew the exact spots where to stop and they also let us request stops for photos. The lunch in the mountains in a local family's home was just delicious with the most breathtaking views. The host was so nice and served a great multi course lunch using local grown organic produce and meat. The price is very reasonable for a full day excursion. On the company's website they suggest that you bring school supplies or clothes for the kids in the different villages and I think that is a great idea. In fact, besides the really high reviews, they won me over with that suggestion. This was my in-laws first visit to Morocco and Arib Voyages helped give a great impression, it's been about a month since we have been back from Morocco and my in-laws are still talking about how great the excursion was. I have to say that Arib Voyages has won a customer for life. Thank you for an amazing time :)"

Our guide Bachir (the kindest and nicest man) picked us up at our hotel in a 4x4 suv. He told us up front that was our day and we could chose to do whatever we wanted to do, stop wherever we wanted to. He had some suggestions that we could accept or not, without any problem. We choose to stop at a local, typical Berber market which was amazing, and we preferred to pass on the camel ride. Than we visited the 3 valleys of the atlas with stops to take photos whenever we wanted to. The lunch was the highlight of our entire trip to marocco. It was in a house of a Berber family of 8, in their terrace, in the middle of a super little village. It was a super intimate environment, and the idea of do it in a family house over a restaurant shows the detail that Arib puts on their service. Not to mention that was the most delicious food that we had in marocco: chicken tagine and cuscus with vegetable , all organic. The whole experience was amazing. We learned a lot about marocco and the Atlas Mountains with Bachir. It is a must do in marocco and we super recommend Arib."

What was exceptional however was that the day before we were due to go we were informed that the weather would be bad and did we want to rearrange if possible. Luckily we were able to change the date and the chosen day was sunny throughout. Another company I was looking at did not do this and would have taken us on that original rainy day so I was quite happy with AVDT. They explained that on a rainy day a lot of the roads would have been inacessible. Having completed the trip you definitely need to do it on a dry day. The guys turned up on time and took us in clean Land Cruisers. The views were stunning and there was plenty of opportunities to take photos. Halfway we stopped to have food at a Berber house; the food and accompanying views was just unforgettable. Overall we had a great time with engaging guides and beautiful views.

            "review": "Shukran Arib Voyages. Had one of the best guided tours we have ever had - anywhere. Bachir was at once extremely knowledgeable, culturally sensitive and delivered a fantastic and highly customized experience. We had the three valley tour with a camel ride. Top 5 highlights of the tour we particularly enjoyed:1) Lunch with a Berber family. Hands down the best tagine we had in our entire trip. The onion-caramelized chicken, family grown vegetables and herbs, couscous made from scratch and fresh tomato salad were flavorful and refined. A 5-star meal in an incredible setting overlooking the Atlas Mountains.2) Bachir. The best tour guide one could ever ask for. Bachir regaled us with history, literature, anthropology, politics and music of the region. What was also remarkable was Bachir's own family history from the desert that gave us a glimpse of the Morocco that no guidebook could ever tell us.3) The village market in Ourika Valley. A great place to see village life - barbers, traditional healers, spice tradesmen, the freshest vegetables and fruits, blacksmiths, fashionistas - vibrant, authentic, eye opening. We were definitely not in Marrakech any more.4) The river dip. Suspension bridge and a refreshing dip in the clear waters of one of the valleys. An unexpected treat.5) The drive. Stunning vistas, fertile valleys, walnut, apple, peach, argan, mimosa trees, mountain villages, Berber cats, red earth, off road views. Go with these guys. Could not imagine that anyone would come close."

I had very high expectations based on the reviews here on Tripadvisor but our guide Mouktar exceeded them even further. Eversince we got in his car we felt his warmth, kindness and professionalism. Throughout the whole day he was so informative, funny and very attentive and let us set the pace of our amazing journey. I honestly do not know where to begin - the Berber market, the stunning views, the delicious lunch, the nice visit in the coop... Each minute of our day with Mouktar was full of new experiences, a lot of laugh and music. Thanks to him we learned a lot about the nomads, their tough life, the dessert and the geopolitical situation in the whole region. We liked eachother so much that after the lovely day we all had together we met again in the evening, had superb dinner(he showed us his favourite kebap restaurant) and enjoyed Marrakech by night. I can not highly recommend Mouktar and his company. All I can say is we found a new friend in his face and will definitely be back for the 3 day Sahara experience."

The weather was pretty cold and dreary in the morning, which is unusual in June, but it cleared up over the afternoon, gradually revealing the beautiful landscapes of the region. If we have the chance to go back to Marrakech for a longer time, a desert tour with this company would definitely be on the agenda."

He told us of his life growing up in the Sahara desert and played us traditional music from the region in the car.We started with a visit to the local market which was a brilliant experience to see Moroccan life outside of the city. Afterwards, we drove out to the Atlas Mountains and visited the 3 valleys. Omar was chatty and made several stops for us to take pictures in various locations. We stopped for tea by the river and passed several small villages within the Mountains. We then made our way to a Berber village where a young Berber lad took us on a 1.5 hour trek to his parents\u2019 house where we ate a delicious traditional Berber lunch on the terrace overlooking the mountains. We barely came into contact with another tourist on the whole trip so the day felt very authentic and \u2018off the beaten track\u2019 and full of hidden gems.

We only had 4 days in Marrakech, but after reading so many great reviews of this company, we decided to book the 3 valleys trip with them. It happened to be the best day of our vacation. Our guide Omar was very friendly and professional. He answered all of our questions so we learned a lot about life in Morocco. We started the day with a camel ride (it is optional, 10 euros or 100 dirhams extra) - we took a nice, approximately 25 minute stroll around some Berber houses outside of Marrakech. Ahmed, our camel guy, even sang some Berber songs for us. Next we visited a traditional local market, selling local produce and animals. It was a very authentic experience as we did not see any other tourists there. The highlight of the day was the trip to the Atlas mountains. On our way there we visited a local argan oil cooperative (optional, there is absolutely no pressure to buy anything) - the products are a bit pricier but they seem to be of high quality (only cash is accepted). We passed a lot of small villages on our way with children returning from school. You can bring some pens, pencils or notebooks for them, they will be very grateful. We also took a hike around some villages with incredible views of the mountains and ended it in a local Berber house where we were served an absolutely delicious lunch (salad, bread, olives, chicken tajine, couscous, dessert) on a terrace. The day is well-paced, not rushed at all. We were supposed to be back by 4pm but when we told Omar that we wanted to visit Jardin Majorelle he took us there and even waited for us till we were finished and took us back to the hotel (even though it was like 6.30). Awesome service.The tour was 70 euro per person. Highly recommended."

Our guide Cheikh was friendly, knowledgable and made the experience fun and rewarding. If you can go on a day where the local Berber market takes place, you'll see a much more traditional type of market compared to Marrakech. Our tour consisted of a camel ride on a tree lined trail (which was an extra 10 euros a person), a drive through the ourika valley where the local resorts and restaurants literally extend into the river, a visit to a local Berber market, a visit to an argan oil cooperative that benefits the local women, a home cooked lunch high in the mountains in the terrace of a Berber family home, and an off-road drive through two other valleys in the region. Arib Voyages requested we bring gifts, like school supplies, for the many local children we passed driving through the villages, and I'm glad we did because they really seemed to appreciate it. I highly recommend this tour, and our guide Cheikh - the tour was worth every penny."

The company is locally owned by a family that used to be nomad's - their English is superb and their background gives them great knowledge of the ways of the Berber and the region making them unique from the rest of the tour groups. Also unique and amazing is you have lunch at the home of a Berber family - the food was the best meal we had in Morocco. The home itself has gorgeous views of the area - you felt like you were at a resort (the company helped the family build out the balcony so to help make it authentic but also comfortable for tourists).

            "review": "Highlight of Our Trip. I booked Arib Voyages' Three Valley Tour from home for my 24-year-old niece, her boyfriend, and me, and we couldn't have been more pleased with the entire experience. Bachir started the business with two of his brothers and a cousin three years ago, and he is duly proud of the service they provide, which is both deeply personal and professional. We had rented a little house in the Medina through AirBnb, so I didn't think Bachir would be able to find it, but he arrived 5 minutes early and escorted us to his Toyota Highlander, which he was able to park nearby as it was Sunday. The three valleys were each beautiful and fascinating and each quite different than the next. Bachir's English is superb, and he could not have been more accommodating. He offered to stop whenever we wanted for views or photos. We chose not to have the camel ride, but we loved the Women's Argan Cooperative. The products there are the finest you can get, so they are, as others have commented, more expensive than in the souks, but you get what you pay for. Cash only, though, so if you think you will buy there, be prepared with cash. Like most places, dirhams, euros, USD all accepted. We did not bring enough cash, but our guide at the coop said she would trust Bachir to bring her our cash next time he came through, so we could get what we wanted and give the cash to Bachir when we were back in Marrakesh. I thought that was quite a comment on Bachir's professionalism. Although the tour description says it leaves at 9am and usually returns by 4, we ended up not getting back till 7, in part because we were slow at the cooperative, took the longer walk, and dawdled over the home-cooked, delicious, and copious lunch. Because it was late, Bachir offered to stop at a place so we could buy dinner. We thought bringing sandwiches to our wee house would suit us, and he brought us to a shop where we bought two sandwiches for the three of us -- they were huge and very delicious. I nearly left out the visit to the huge Berber market on the outskirts of town --not for tourists. It was fascinating, and Bachir explained various unusual stalls and helped with our purchases there, which were extremely reasonable. I wish I could have bought more, especially after tasting the fresh pressed olive oil, but the packaging would not have worked on the plane. When we started the long walk, my niece had to use a bathroom, so we stopped in the house of the local guide's sister. That was also quite fascinating, as we were not expected. The walk was beautiful, down one side of a valley and up the other for lunch. I'm 62 and had to stop twice on the way up as we were also at about 5700 feet in altitude. It was not otherwise too strenuous, and I'm very pleased we did it. At the house for lunch, Bachir showed us the house and they way the family lives -- quite different than in the west, and we ate on a terrace with a great view of the valley we had just hiked. There were roosters crowing, cows mooing, and sheep or goats chiming in as well. Bachir explained how he met the family by chance and how they eventually began doing business together, and what it has meant to the family -- their house has been updated, including a brand new western-style bathroom. This experience was so much richer than the restaurant meal provided in similar tours. The website for Arib Voyages does not publish the price, but we three paid 55 euros each -- cash only. Dirhams or USD also fine at the bank exchange rate, so I paid $60. The price was non-negotiable, but also very reasonable. Finally, the trip also involved two spectacular dirt roads to traverse the mountain tops between the valleys. We loved those, although if you are prone to motion sickness or fear of heights, be forewarned, and take the longer offered option. My niece remembered to bring clothing for the children, and they could not have been happier. I regretted that I forgot, but I happened to have several ballpoint pens in my bag, and the children were happy for those. Pads to write or draw on and colored Sharpies would have been heaven for them, too. Lastly, we each gave Bachir a tip, but he seemed quite surprised, and thought we had made an error in the price."

We had a beautiful lunch at a Berber family's house that Bechir has become friends with over the years of running the Arib Tour company.

We spent a whole day in the comfort of his 4x4, his relaxed and friendly yet knowledgable company, we really couldn't have asked for more. First stop was a local market which was colourful and serves the local people who some travelled a distance to get there to stock up on fresh food for their families. Onwards to the picturesque valleys and a visit to the ladies co-op for Argan oil which was interesting to see how they produce the oil from its original form. More driving (some off road!) exploring the mountains, meeting local children (bring little gifts like pencils etc and you will be rewarded with the largest smiles) and reaching the highest part of the mountain where Bashir had organised lunch (3 course home cooked meal) at a wonderful Berber house with a jaw dropping views on the terrace and the loveliest ladies in the house who welcomed us and fed us really tasty local home cooked food and made us feel like special guests. Finally we concluded this incredible experience with a walk in the mountains and a drive through another valley with a multitude of stops to capture the scenery on our cameras. I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Marrakech that they take a day out of the huddle and bustle of the city and see how the locals live and how picturesque the Atlas Mountains are. Thank you Bashir for making our day one to always remember!"

We were picked up by our guide Basheer who gave us options of what there was to do and see as he guided us up the windy and some off roading through the breath taking Atlas Mountains! We opted to take a walk through the fresh market where the Berbers get all of their goods and foods for the week. What an experience! There was also the opportunity to do a camel ride which we of course opted for! We also decided to do a hike with a local Berber to where we would eventually end up having lunch at a local Berbers house on the shaded deck overlooking the gorgeous high peaks of the mountains. The lunch was by far the best meal of the trip! Our guide was very knowledgable and spoke perfect English. He let us take up every photographic opportunity there was! We highly recommend Arib Voyages if you plan to see the Atlas Mountains or go on a few day excursion through the dessert."

We absolutely recommend it! Our guide picked us up at our Riad in his 4WD and took us out to the Atlas Mountains, he gave us the complete choice of what we wanted to do, whether we wanted to see the real local markets which just includes food and goods, hikes, camel rides, check out where they make Argon oil, and whether or not we were up for some off-roading. Our guide was very knowledgable, spoke English perfectly and made us feel very comfortable. We opted to do the hike to where we ate lunch at a local Berbers house. The hike was relatively moderate except that it was in the heat of the day. Lunch was the best meal of the trip! You eat outside in a shaded area on cushions and Berber rugs and overlook the mountains which were stunning! We had traditional moroccan salad, chicken tangine, vegetable couscous, the best bread, olives, fresh fruit and mint tea! The trip was absolutely breathtaking and we are from the Rocky Mountains! The guide made the trip that much better as well!!! Do not have one bad thing to say about our experience, would recommend it to everyone, and would definitely use Arib Voyages for another Moroccan excursion in the future!"

The whole way through the tour we were given options to do more walking, visit different places or take photos. You must visit the women's cooperative. There is no pressure to buy. They don't give you a hard sell. Yet with we left with loads of wonderful products because they were amazing. We got an amazing overview of the Atlas Mountains and the Bedouin people. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. He helps you to feel comfortable throughout the day. There is no pressure to buy extras or souvenirs at your stops. The lunch is amazing, don't have a large breakfast. The families home that you eat at are wonderful. They are very accommodating and the food is out of this world, with the most amazing view. You don't have to, but I would advise taking some colouring pens and books/paper for the children who live in the mountains. The guide will not stop for the children if you haven't bought some with you, so there is no guilt trip or pressure. He did realise we had until we told him. Seeing how happy this made the children was very rewarding. We can't recommend this trip and company enough."

Our guide, Bachir, was obviously very passionate about the country and the information he provided during the day was both interesting and engaging. Some great highlights:-We were given the opportunity to customize our trip! Bachir offered a list of several activities, from camel riding to visiting a local market, and we were able to choose the items that appealed to us. How cool?-One of the options was a hike along the mountain road- the views were lovely- Lunch was with a Berber family in their home. The food was by far the best we had in Morocco, and the hospitality from the family was equally splendid-We were provided with water and fruit for the car ride, and even got the chance to listen to some \"desert music\"Final verdict- our tour was on a foggy day, but the experience was unforgettable in every way. I would book again with this company in a heartbeat, and if you get a chance, you should too!"

He let us stop for photos whenever we liked and also bought us water. The three valleys were stunning and breath taking which leads to the highlight of the trip which is the lunch in the Berber's family house the food is amazing no doubt the best meal of the whole trip and plenty of food to be had so no going hungry. You also get an authentic feel and experience of what its like in the local village and in a berber's house. They where very welcoming and the view from their sitting area is just so peaceful and relaxing. I would recommend this excursion to my friends and family and would encourage this tour operator due to that one in a life time experience authentic experience. Also would recommend visiting the argon oil cooperative which is included in the trip at your choice (for free) and to top it all off the price is amazing for two people is worth just over \u00a3100 for a whole day including food. At the end of the trip Mokhtar also drove us to go and visit the majarelle gardens due to it being out the way of the medina and on the way to our hotel, this was very kind of him and did it for no extra cost. He truly showed outstanding customer service!"

What a day! Partly due to natural beauties of Morocco but also thanks to our guide Bachir. He picked the right spots along the way and with his in depth knowledge of Moroccan culture and geography made this such an enjoyable trip.

I would recommend to go on Sunday as the market we went to was in full motion, and we got to see many of the vendors in action; cutting meat, blacksmiths, dentist, and barbers. He next took us on a scenic drive up through the three valleys. I would recommend bringing at least 4 inexpensive paperback coloring books and at least 3-4 packs of markers or pencils. As you will get a chance to meet a lot of the local children and can rip down the spine of the books to give them their own color packs. We were also able to see the the 3 distinct valleys and some of the villages on the way. Our lunch stop at a local house was awesome. We had a traditional meal, which was very good, and got to see a local house. On our way down we stopped for pictures of the High Atlas Mountain, and had a pleasant ride back to our accommodations. It was an overall great experiences and we wish we had more time within the Atlas Mountain area."

As we only stayed in Marrakesh for two nights, we only booked a half-day trip with Arib Voyages to get a glimpse of the authentic Berber villages in the areas edging into the Atlas Mountains.Personally, it was the highlight of holiday in Morocco. The views were absolutely stunning (we were lucky to have an almost crystal clear sky on that day). The contrasting reds, green hues of the valley set against the backdrop of clearly visible snowy Atlas peaks created a breathtaking sight. We opted for a lunch with the local family instead of the restaurant option and got to see a little bit of how they live, which was really interesting. It's worth mentioning that, if you're somewhat underwhelmed by some of the tagines offered in restaurants - the home-made cooking is a must-try! Coupled with a cosy terrace at the top of the house , where you can enjoy tea and the lovely food surrounded by serene landscape - just perfect. Just to clarify - don't expect a luxurious, hotel-like experience. It's an authentic house in which the hosts, together with the help from Arib Voyages guys did the best they could for the comfort of the visiting guests, with what they had available. This is the very charm of the experience. Our guide on this trip was Bachir - Great guy and equaly great guide. Bachir's very knowlegeable and he crafted the trip entirely to our requirments, making sure we didn't miss a the best spots but also being mindful of our time constraints making the experience flow effortlessly without rushing at any point. Five out of five stars for the experience and Bachir. I am planning to do the Atlas hike with them in the near future."

We ended up leaving our booking of the day tour to the Atlas mountains and the three valleys to the last minute and relied on TripAdvisor to point to the best options. The first we called at short notice was not available, but Arib responded within an hour and were able to take us out . The trip was a great experience and my partner especially enjoyed the authenticity of the experience but at the same time the safety of the tour, considering this was her first time in North Africa. We followed a good programme with prompt collection and attentive discussion throughout the day about the history and geography of the region. We also heard about Bachir's early childhood in desert South of the Atlas Mountains. Having heard about bringing things for the kids we would come across on the road, we stopped with him at a stall shop on the road out and bought 10 colouring books and ten crayon sets, he has candy left over from the last trip and we headed into the mountains along the valley. The kids we met were so much fun and my partner enjoyed seeing them and giving them firstly the crayons and books, then candy. So - please bring cool colouring things with you pens pencils, pads, books, for kids aged 1 to 10. I included a couple of pics here with the kids as well. The tour company has made a great arrangement with a family in the high valley for the lunch stop. Food was great and more than enough. Served by the family on the roof deck with a fabulous view. We went off-road a little and had a great day. Also stopped and bought Argan oil from a small co-operative. So when I come back to Marrakech next time - I will ask Bachir to take us on the desert tour, which should be very interesting. Thanks Bachir and the Arib team from Mark and Andrea!"

I was picked up at the airport with a 4-wheel drive car that was clean and safe to get around in the desert. Mukhtar made me feel at ease the whole trip, made sure there were enough picture moments and moments to stretch the legs and have a bite/drink. He is very knowledgeable and will tell you all about how he, his family and community have lived in the desert with full passion. In his words: \" Please do keep on asking questions as I love to tell you all about our region and communities\". The panoramic views during the trip and in the camp are stunning and views you would not want to miss when visiting Morocco. Overall, I would recommend Arib Voyages and Mukhtar as a guide to any visitors wanting to see the desert and experience an all-inclusive and unique experience."

We felt very safe with him in what was a completely strange environment for us. We asked a lot of questions about life in Marrakech and he gave us some invaluable advice, particularly around haggling and tipping, which helped us hugely when we explored the city independently afterwards. Arib tours were very flexible when we brought our planned tour forward a couple of days to avoid forecasted rain on our original day. It was the only tour we saw that offered 3 valleys and included a meal at a Berber family home. This was the main reason we chose it and we are so glad that we did.

The snow covered peaks of the Atlas were something to see! Omar told us about the Berber villages we passed and happily answered any questions we had. We stopped for lunch at a Berber house where we had one of the most delicious meals we had throughout our time in Morocco. And the views from the terrace of the house were unbelievable. The day is a lot of driving, but the mountains are so beautiful that I was never bored. I cannot recommend this tour company enough, or our guide, Omar.

The tour itself takes in the breathtaking scenery, and we took Bachir up on the \"off-road\" option, cruising at 2000metres on a unmade road for spectacular views. The highlight was the amazing food and hospitality of the Berber family where we lunched. Some reviews say there is a lot of driving and yes it's true but the scenery is so amazing, and there are add-on options like a camel ride, or a mint tea stop overlooking the Ourika valley that none of us were ever bored. If you can make your trip on the day of a Berber market, do so its eye popping and fascinating!"

Scenery was amazing and unreason 30cm snow was the icing on the cake!"

            "review": "Great experience - something different to the hustle of the Medina (old town). We were a little short on time and opted for the 1-day trip into the Atlas Mountains to visit 3 of the valleys. Our driver spoke well enough English to make the trip useful and was happy to answer any questions and stop at any places along the way we wanted. By far the best part of the trip was having lunch at a home in the Berber village in the mountains, which is cooked by local people, overlooking the picturesque mountains - a real treat! If I were to come back to Marrakech, I'd definitely look into doing a more extended tour into the desert. One thing I would say however, is that there is a lot of driving involved in this trip; you head out at 9am and return back to your hotel between 4 and 5. Although this was fine for us, it's definitely something to think about if you have young children as they may get a little restless."

And we weren't disappointed. Our guide Mokthar, a co-owner of this family-run business, was very friendly and competent. Perfectly speaking English and French, we learnt a lot from him about Marrakesh, the Atlas Mountains and Morocco itself.One of the highlights of the tour, apart from the snowy mountains themselves, was the authentic lunch a a private home in a Berber mountain village.We'd like to go on a 4-day tour to the desert next time we come back. And we will certainly check Arib Voyages' availability first."

The accommodations were above and beyond any expectations. The food that was served to us, was very tasty and lots to go around. The desert was jaw dropping beautiful, I would also suggest you do the Chegaga desert instead of merzouga as the dunes are higher and much less touristy. This tour company is authentic and I intend on coming back to Morocco. Thank you Mochtar and thank you for the sash gift! - Bryan V"

His primary aim was to ensure that I had the best possible experience, which meant accommodating my requests to go off the beaten path at times. Thanks to his extensive knowledge of the area and local culture, I learned everything from details on topography and flora to the funny characteristics and habits of camels. I can't recommend Arib Voyages highly enough and will call on them to help me explore other parts of Morocco when I return."

Our family of four (two teenagers) spent four days/three nights with Mokhtar and enjoyed every moment. He picked us up at our Riad in Marrakesh and drove us safely and in his well appointed four wheel drive vehicle into the the real desert, not just a simple stop on the edge of the desert. Along the way, Mokhtar explained so many things for us, bringing us to a much deeper understanding of life in his beloved Sahara. We were able to see so many aspects of the Sahara landscape from the sand dunes to the dry lakes, ride camels, stop and take pictures, see Berber nomads in their daily lives. We stayed in authentic nomad tents, ate delicious local foods and enjoyed a campfire and music native to the region. We saw the Sahara sunset and the moon rise, with only a simple turning of your head. Spectacular. Along the drive, at our request, Mokhtar found places for us to to see local crafts such as Argan oil, Berber carpets, pottery. We also explored the mountains and local casbahs along the way, and each of the riads he arranged were kind and comfortable. Mokhtar was fantastic. We always felt safe with him, he took care of all of the details so that we could relax, learn and enjoy. He was polite, friendly, informative, and gave us a real flavor of Morocco. I thoroughly recommended this company for the beautiful experience they gave us. Mokhtar was our guide, but at the end, he had also become our friend. You won\u2019t regret booking your tour with Arib Voyages."

For years I\u2019ve hoped to go to Morocco with a goal of sleeping under the stars in the desert. Last spring ticket prices went on sale and without delay I booked a flight and began emailing a few tour companies to get some help planning my dream trip. Several companies had great websites and responded with planned itineraries and rates but only one company sent me an email asking me what I would like to do on my trip. I sent my wish list of cities and experiences and Arib Voyages wrote me back with advice on what was realistic pointing out some locations and highlights for me to consider. Arib Voyages helped me plan a customized trip that incorporated all I\u2019d wished for, and much, much, more. We just returned from a most incredible journey that took us on planes, trains, 4-wheel drives, buses and camels. We traveled from bustling cities with huge souks to charming and quaint villages with locally owned cooperatives. We climbed to the top of the Atlas Mountains, through the beautiful Draa Valley to finally reach and enjoy the peaceful solitude of the desert. We enjoyed seeing mirages, an enormous dried up lake full of fossils, the argon, olive, orange, almond and banana trees, saffron farms and even managed to spend some time relaxing by the ocean. We took in views of captivating and unforgettable sunrises and sunsets, especially the one we experienced from the top of the sand dunes. We were even able to open up nature\u2019s jewel box to view the most miraculous sight \u2013 a starry sky in the desert with the dunes in the backdrop. But the best part of our tour was not just the personalized experience, it was our tour guide. From the moment we arrived in Morocco, our guide treated us like a close friend, Bachir Elammari, made sure our trip was beyond exceptional. Every detail was personalized for us and by us, organized by what we wanted to do, see or experience. At the start of every day Bachir talked through the day's plans, detailing some of the various activities and options for the day giving us a chance to make detours along the way. And throughout the tour we were given history, facts, details and trivia galore. Bachir passionately and generously shared his love of his country and his culture with us. It was really hard to say goodbye. He made us feel like a part of his family. If you are thinking about a trip to Morocco, I\u2019m sure there are plenty of companies out there but there are none like Arib Voyages and without question, there is no better guide that Bachir. So glad that he is a part of our amazing memories in Morocco."

Mokhtar made stops along the road if we wanted to take pictures, and he also bought us Tuareg scarves as a gift, because we had mentioned we were interested in bying this before the desert! That was so nice of him! From Merzouga we rode camels to our camp, and stopped to see the sun set over the dunes.

Well, I was wrong. Those guys did a great job - everything was organized, everything had as much comfort as we expected and if I ever come back to Morocco again, I will contact Omar and his guys before booking anything.

The desert was (insert f-word here) amazing!!!! The dunes, the camels, the bloody sandstorm and the biggest spider I ever saw in my life. Hahaha ;) We also did the one day mountain tour (starting in Marakech) which I absolutley recommend because it gets you out of the heat and crazyness of the city and you will see amazing views AND - also most important for me - I ate the best food here during the 10 days we stayed in Moroco.

We emailed to arrange a few weeks beforehand, and they were quick to respond. The first trip was to Essaouira, we were picked up on time at our riad by Mustapha, he was a very knowledgeable and friendly guide, he spoke very good English. The drive to Essaouira is about 3 hours, we stopped on the way at the goat tree (unusual) and an argan oil co-operative (I'd give that a miss, overpriced and pushy) and for a few pics. We got to Ess. just after 12, Mustapha was very easy about pickup times and we agreed that 4pm would be enough time (it was just about enough). We had lunch at the fish stalls, really pushy salesmen here, much worse than Jemaa el Fna, fish was nice but chips were cold. After walking round the town and being offered some very suspicious biscuits from a hippy it was time to go back. When we got to the small town of Tafetachte (something like that anyway!) there was an arab \"fantasia\" going on (horses and guns) so Mustapha offered to stop here and let us look round. This was really interesting although i think we were the only Europeans in town that day! We got back to MK at about 7.30 and Mustapha dropped us off in Gueliz as we wanted some dinner there.Next day was the 3 valleys, Moktar picked us up on time and again was a very knowledgeable and friendly guide. We explained how we wanted to buy a Tagine whilst in Morocco so he stopped at a roadside stall and bought us one as a gift (and later bought us some spices from Asni souk to go in it). We had mint tea in a yoga retreat then lunch at the Berber house, food was really good here. Moktar was good at answering our questions, stopping for photos and keeping our daughter entertained. The scenery on the tour was stunning, the roads were narrow and twisty but felt safe with Moktar's driving. We got back to MK at about 4 If/when I visit Marrakech again I'd take another tour with these, they may not be the cheapest put I felt that we got good value."

Moctar was a great guide and tool us to some really great spots: women's argon oil cooperative, amazing Berber home lunch, river valley, Berber market and amazing mountain views. He even got us back to Marrakech to see the Majorelle Gardens and waited for us to take up back to our apartment afterwards. Great day! Highly recommended!!"

            "review": "THIS WAS THE GREATEST DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE!. My friend came to visit me while I studied abroad in Belgium and we decided to go to Marrakech for five days. We weren't really sure what to expect, but if you only had enough time to do one thing here, it would be to go on this tour! We went on the day tour with Mokhtar up to the mountains and really experienced the feel of Morocco and Berber lifestyle. And HE IS INCREDIBLE! He is seriously the kindest person and so knowledgable and fun! He picked us up at 9 am promptly and we set off. We are so lucky to have gone with him! He took us to a Berber market (wear good shoes-- especially for mud) and got me a tagine-- then told me all about how to prepare and cook in it. We stopped at this incredible place where widowed and divorced women make argan oil by hand-- the whole process from grinding to packaging-- and sell the products for income. And this to me was a good cause so obviously I bought the amazing oil and a little gift package. And it's so cheap compared to other places and it's a good cause. He made sure to stop always and whenever we asked for photos, as well as made sure we had bathroom breaks and water. He answered literally every question I had about anything, his English is very good. He also has a hilarious stories!! He has excellent driving skills because I know I would have died of fright just seeing the heights and road conditions in some places. But we were very safe. There is an Incredible view of the mountains the entire time (we also were in them), we saw all four seasons in a 2 hour span. We had mint tea in the sunshine at this lovely yoga resort. Then we went for a delicious lunch way way up in the mountains, typical Berber style-- they accommodated for my vegetarian needs and we had bread and olive oil, tajine and couscous, desert, and mint tea. I have never eaten so much in my life so be prepared. It was totally worth the money, completely. He got us tasty pastries from his favorite shop and brought us right back where we needed to be. It was about 7 hours and every moment was great! Definitely 10000% go on this tour and ask for Mokhtar!!"

We booked Arib Voyages through our Riad.Mokhtar our guide for the day arrived promptly at 9am and escorted us to his car.He quickly explained our itinerary and made us feel very relaxedHe was happy to take the trip at our pace-were headed for the Ourika Valley and waterfall.Our first stop was a woman's cooperative making Argan Oil. This was a fascinating insight and I was able to try myself cracking the Argan nuts.Mokhtar then arranged for us to have tea. We had to cross a very rickety bridge but we made it. The tea was delicious. Our next stop was at the bottom of the waterfall. Here we had another guide, Hassan. It was a tricky climb but well worth it.Our lunch, included in the price was a 3 course local dish, beautiful food.Our day spent with Mokhtar was fantastic. He was polite, friendly, informative, and gave us a real flavour of Morocco. I would thoroughly recommended this company for the beautiful day they gave us. Thankyou Mokhtar."

            "review": "What an amazing experience!. If you want an authentic and enjoyable experience in Morocco, I highly recommend using the guys at Arib Voyages for any guided tours you wish to do.Once I'd decided on a last-minute solo trip to Marrakech, a friend put me in touch with Bashir from Arib Voyages with whom I had a few pleasant chats on the phone from London. When my flight to Marrakech arrived after midnight, he had a car waiting for me to take me to the riad I had booked.On Bashir's recommendation, I decided on the Atlas Mountains & Three Valleys tour the next day and my driver/guide Omar arrived quite promptly the following morning. I was impressed with Omar's friendliness and his excellent local knowledge as he took me on a tour of the Atlas mountains and the valleys of Moulay Brahim, Azni and Ourika. This included a stop for a camel ride, a trawl through a large Berber market, a visit to an Argan oil co-operative and, for lunch, an excellent, authentic meal at a home in one of the Berber villages in the shadow of Toubkal, north Africa's highest peak (4,167 feet). The juxtaposition of the warm, bright sunshine and the snow-capped peaks was spectacular and the village life was fascinating. Omar was always accommodating, pointing out some great views, stopping regularly to let me take photos and occasionally allowing me to get out and walk a bit in the cool mountain air, picking me up further down the hillside. A couple days later, I was heading out with Omar again - this time to the coastal town of Essaouira, which he had recommended during our chats on the Three Valleys tour. There isn't a huge amount to see on the 2.5 hour route, but the sight of goats climbing the Argan trees is an amusing treat not to be missed, along with the beat of Omar's Tuareg music tracks. The Portuguese/Meditarranean influence becomes apparent as you get closer - the whitewashed and blue buildings a contrast to the clay red of those further inland.After the busy streets of Marrakech, Essaouira was refreshing - a laid back, beautiful old town, rich in history, set against the crashing waves of the Atlantic. After some tips from Omar, I set out to visit the town's fishing port and old fort with its ancient ramparts and cannon, and to explore the streets, alleys, shops and souks of the Old Medina. There is less hassle in the souks here - less pressure to buy from the vendors and prices are a little better, so in the end I did most of my shopping in Essaouira. For lunch, Omar guided me to the lovely Il Mare restaurant, which overlooks the fort and ocean. Prices here were slightly higher than elsewhere, but the food was delicious!After some more exploring, I headed back to Marrakech, only to leave a bag of items I'd bought in Omar's vehicle. I didn't even notice until he contacted me the next day and brought it to my riad. A stroke of luck, as his planned two-day trip to the Sahara with some other customers had been called off!My trip to Morocco was made so much more enjoyable in the very capable hands of Arib Voyages, and Omar, a knowledgable, friendly and helpful guide, who speaks excellent English. Their prices are reasonable and having a one-on-one guide will certainly draw some envious glances from fellow tourists on crowded tour buses. I will definitely be checking in with Arib Voyages again on my next trip to Morocco!"

Mokhtar from Arib voyages drove us up the Atlas Mountains on a day trip so that we could appreciate the scenery and visit the mountains. He was very obliging and helpful and we were given the opportunity to stop whenever and wherever we wanted to take photos. The scenery was stunning and we went from relative warmth to snow and cold. He drove well in some difficult conditions particularly nearer the top where there was a lot of snow and we felt safe with him. The aim of the visit was lunch with a Berber family which was not as described, however, was a very interesting experience and one I am glad that we had. I am fairly sure the family lived elsewhere but provided lunches in a relatively new house in the village so the house did not feel lived in or furnished for a family but was a good indication of the conditions they lived in and what a tough people they are to survive in the mountains particularly during the winter. The lunch was lovely and very healthy. Mokhtar spoke English well and was able to answer a lot of our questions about Marrakesh and the difference between the Mountain Berbers and those of the desert. He was very open and it was interesting to be able to chat with him about a range of subjects. We visited a women's co-operative and the conditions they were working in were harsh bless them but it was good to see them being offered the opportunity to work and be independent and we stopped for coffee at a very pleasant mountain Riadh offering yoga courses.All in all a very good day and we gained a lot from the experience."

I'm not only speaking about the touristic places that they show us in one day: medina, majorelle, a little and real tradicional village. For me the real experience with arib voyages it's to know Bashir and Moughtar, the guides who accompanied us during our tour of one day. So friendly people from the first moment. With this people, you feel in family. They are not only guides, the help they take to us it's the help that a friend take to you. In a touristic city like Marrakech it's so dificult looks someone like Moughtar and Bashir, so profesionals and so friendlys. I will never forget their personalitys, their jokes, their implication. I'm really grateful. I hope to can return to Marrakech more times, and one of the reason it's to happen more time with this people. I sit down in debt with him!! Thank you arib voyages for this experience, i hope to know more people like you in the world! Thank you of hearth friends!!"

They arranged for our transport to and from the airport, our riad in Marrakesh, and a trip to the Sahara.Fed greeted us at the airport, with no problems even though our plane was late and it was the middle of the night. He drove us as close as possible to our riad, which was in the old medina and walked us the rest of the way helping us with our luggage. This was at 1:00 am so we really appreciated the guidance. I don't think we would have been able to find it on our own. The Riad Jona was wonderful and we loved our time there. The next day a very nice gentleman from Arib Voyages came to our riad to talk to us about our Sahara trip coming up. He had lots of useful information about what to bring etc.The following morning Bashir picked us up and we headed out to the desert. We had some crazy experiences and delays because Marrakesh and the Sahara were flooded from the rain. They hadn't had rain like that in 25 years, but Bashir handled it in stride and it made our experience very unique. We were crossing rivers in the Sahara by foot and camel because the car couldn't get all the way to the camp. The next day there was more water and Bashir had to drive across a river that was over his headlights. We got out and crossed by foot and Bashir did an excellent job driving across. We video taped it, so if you get a chance, ask him to see the video on his phone:). By the end of our trip with Bashir, he felt like family. He was great with our three kids and had lots of interesting information. We loved his sense of humor, easy-going personality and the sahara music he played for us.It poured down rain the night we spent in the Sahara, but the tents were nice and dry and the food was delicious and ABUNDANT. Bashir and his cousins sang and played the drums for us in the dining tent and our kids got to go sand-boarding between rain showers. We are sad we missed the fire, sunset and stars outside, but not everybody gets to experience a flood in the desert :). Also it was my daughter's 17th birthday and Bashir and his cousins made her a sand cake with real candles, sang happy birthday and gave her a gift. They were so kind and made her birthday really special. She'll never forget getting to spend her birthday in Morocco!Thank you Bashir and Arib Voyages for a spectacular trip! We hope to come back and see a dry desert with you someday. Haha! I highly recommend your company to anyone thinking about visiting Morocco.Best wishes,Alanya, Stuart, Tessa, Weston and Mitchell."

My husband and I did the 3 valleys tour with Omar.It was a great change of pace to get out of the city and the medina.The scenery was stunning and we got some great photos.We had mint tea by the river. We stopped at an argan oil collective. Their products were amazing but the explanation by the lady was rattled off at machine gun pace so although we understood it we didn't really get chance to digest it as we were rushed through.Omar took us to the berber market which was interesting to see. Dentist/barber, butchers and whole tables of remote controls!! There was some off road driving between valleys and we got up really high in the mountains which made for stunning views.We had a late lunch at a berber home which was a special experience. Tomato salad, couscous and tagine with apples for desert. It was all delicious and a great view. To be honest the lunch needed to be late in the day, to make sure you weren't sick on the mountain roads (not a problem for us) and so you could stay awake!!Omar introduced us to Toureg music which was a cool soundtrack for the journey home.We had a lovely day."

Our guide Bashir was friendly and informative with excellent English. As it was a private tour he gave us options for things we could do or visit on the tour, including a fascinating local market, so it was tailored to our interests unlike group tours in the past where you are dragged to shops for the guide'commission. There was a fair bit of driving but we had plenty of stops for photos and for walking just to admire the scenery. We had mint tea in a very pretty location by a river and a lunch stop at a small restaurant at the top of a valley with beautiful views and had the best food of our stay. They had suggested we bring pens and pencils for children in the Berber villages we passed which made the children's faces light up. I only wish I had taken much more. I was so glad we got away from the touristy centre and saw some of the countryside. Bashir comes from a Saharan tribe and was looking forward to guiding his next trip there. If we return to Marrakech we will certainly do a Sahara trip with him!"

Our party of 2 couples from Australia, after lengthy research, decided to use Arib as our means of getting around Morocco.We were not comfortable doing it on our own so after many emails between us, our 10 day and 9 night tour was created.Arib is a small family business and all of them are out doing tours so sometimes, there can be a delay in responding. Be patient .Omar was to be our driver/guide/safety blanket and over our tour, we became very good friends and we all felt very comfortable with him. Omar is a very caring person who was prepared to fit the tour around our needs.eg many many photo stops, extra clean toilet stops, timetables to suit us.We were picked up in our clean, comfortable and late model van and started in Casablanca , travelling to Rabat(1night), Fes (2) Midelt(1)Merzouga(1)and an overnight in the Sahara, Dadas Gorge(1)Ait Ben Hannou(1), Imlil (2)and finally to Essaouira.Before the tour, we asked if we could break the long day down between Fes and Merzouga ..a distance of over 400 kilometres...and we were extremely pleased that arib's flex ability enabled us to do this.It provided us with a slower start to the day, a fantastic visit to a little cave village, wonderful accommodation in Midelt and a swim in their pool.It also meant that by the time we arrived to ride our camels into the desert, we were not exhausted.This was a highlight..7 klms camel ride and sleeping under the stars with food, music and dance.Accommodation for the whole tour was first class and better than we had expected.All riads provided wine/beer for our overnights which is not readily available in Morocco.Arib arranged guides in each of the cities to show us around and they were excellent, providing an in depth knowledge of their area. They also took us to cooperatives where we could buy ceramics, carpets, leather etc and those places all offered shipping services back home, which was very convenient.We also felt that we could trust these shops to do the right thing by us, but, you still need to bargain hard as is the way of living in Morocco.Arib provide on their website a brief sheet on clothing, tipping, customs etc in Morocco and I suggest those booking a tour access this information.It does give you an idea of what to expect on tour.Arib also provided us with transfers between Essaouira and Marrakesh and then to the airport.This as I said is only a small family business however I have no hesitation in recommending them to all my readers and my friends back home.The tour provided to us by Arib ensured an absolutely memorable and exciting experience.Thank you Arib and especially Omar for such a wonderful tourAussie mates"

Omar communicated our situation to the main office and they went out of their way to find a way for us back to Marrakech and to get another flight the following day. They organised an extra night stay at a lovely Riad at no cost, organised the flight booking and a private taxi to get us to Casablanca (3.5 hours away) to catch the flight. We were truly thankful for their generosity and making sure we were alright throughout our stay. A big thank you too to Omar for making things happen for us and keeping our spirits up."

Some spectacular sights we visted include the High Atlas Mountains, touring of ancient kasbahs and ruins, the old and new town of Ait Ben Haddoul, amazing views of the Dadas Gorges and Todras Gorges (I personally feel the view is much more grand and beautiful than the Grand Canyon!), and of course, the unforgettable Sahara Desert - such a beautiful,undisturbed pieceof nature; absolutely breath taking!!! Camel trekking on the Sahara desert, watching the sunset, eating delicious Moroccan salads and tagines out in the open desert, and ending the night off dancing in the dark with the stars shining brightly in the sky is most definitely the highlight of the trip! (Not to mention being dragged down the sand dunes by Omar!!!) Although the heat was quite unbearable (felt like 50 degrees) but the view, the atmosphere and the well organized itinerary really paid it off. Omar's company was not only enjoyable, but his professionalism showed in his actions by being acute and organised, attentive, patient, and just joining in the fun with our silly star jumps, sing offs to Carly Rae Jepsen's 'Call Me Maybe' (Omar's favourite) and dancing made it even more memorable!

The booking was really smooth and simple online. We were picked up directly from the airport by our driver Omar, who had waited patiently for us even though it took way longer than expected for us to pass through the immigration queue. From there we were wizzed off to the comfortable 4x4, driving through the wonderful High Atlas Mountains. We were able to make photo stops along the way and we really appreciated the flexibility. Our trip also included visits to Ait Ben Haddou where we got a tour of the village with a private guide, the spectacular Dades Gorge and Todra Gorge. As we passed by the Draa valley on our way to the Sahara, we passed several vendors who sell dates from the valley. Omar was really sweet and gifted us a box of dates. The Sahara Desert itself was really the highlight amongst highlights of the trip! The camel ride during sunset was surreal and absolutely breathtaking.Accommodation was good across the 4 nights, all rooms having working air conditioning and wifi access (except Sahara camp, but no expectations there!) The camp in the Sahara was very decent (it had working showers and toilets) but we had trouble sleeping in the room due to the humidity and heat, which was a good thing ultimately as I ended up laying outside watching the stars in the Sahara. It was an amazing experience. Food was also great - breakfast and dinner was included in the tour rate, which was really cheap for the level of comfort afforded to us throughout. Along the way we had many photo stops and Omar was extremely good and patient with us doing some very silly poses. He is a great photographer too! We were also invited to plug in our own music in the car which was a nice touch.I'll always remember the laughter everyday with the sing offs in the car and dance off in the desert. I now have a wonderful collection of photos and videos of our unforgettable trip, thanks to Omar. He gave us a wonderful recommendation to a seafood restaurant in Marrakech after our tour ended. And to top it off he also sent us off to the airport the day after. He really treated us like life long friends!I would definitely recommend anybody travelling to Morocco to use Arib Voyages. If you happen to get Omar as a guide, remember that Carly Rae Jepsen's 'Call me maybe' is his favourite song - he can jive and drive on it all day long!"

We started at 830am and from the time we left our riad to our return we had an amazing time. The beauty of the mountains and the lack of anything touristy was exactly what we wanted and what was promised. We stopped to share tea in a quiet river valley, we watched the making of argan oil in the traditional methods and then a highlight of the trip, at 1800 meters up the mountain, lunch at an authentic Berber home. The food and the hospitality was incredible. Marrakech is a wonderful, but busy place. Our day with Mokhtar gave us an opportunity to see the beauty and peacefulness of Morocco. Mokhtar was so easy to talk to (he speaks four languages) and so knowledgeable, but he also gave us time alone to enjoy the beauty of the country he so obviously loves. We recommend this tour to anyone who wants to get away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech and spend a day with a great guide. Thank you Muhktar for a day we will never forget. Highly recommended, and the price was good as well, by Heather and John / Canada."

Bookings were handled efficiently via email prior to arrival in Morocco and we were picked up by our driver at the appointed time for each trip in the lobby of our hotel.The roads in Morocco aren't the best, so we really appreciated the safe driving by both of the different drivers we had over the 3 trips; the cars were also new and obviously well maintained and comfortable.We really enjoyed all 3 trips we took and would recommend them all, however if you were pressed for time we would rank them in the following order:1) 3 Valleys of the High Atlas - lots of scenery, lots of stops along the way, very interesting Berber market, delicious and scenic lunch at a private house in a Berber village plus a chance to walk along the deserted roadside high in the mountains. Our favoutite.2) Essaouira day trip - the tour only includes transport to and from Essaouira so you walk around yourself - highly recommended, much quieter than Marrakech and nice cafes around. The old fort was picturesque and the beach was great.3) Ouzoud waterfalls day trip - amazing spectacular falls, but quite a drive from Marrakech. We got a chance to hike down to the bottom of the falls and then have lunch, before climbing up the opposite side.Would definitely recommend this tour company and we were glad we booked before arrival - in Marrakech you get the feeling that everyone is trying to rip you off and we definitely didn't get this feeling with Arib Voyages."

The best food we had on our trip and eaten out on the terrace overlooking the mountains. Very special.It was very hot during our trip so we didn't quite experience the fresh mountain air we had expected and it was quite a lot if time driving so a little tiring.

We had heard about Arib Voyages through our friends who loved their experience, but we also did our research before we booked, and landed on Arib Voyages because the company and the tours definitely sounded the best.We had the best time on the trip, and three of us friends being foodies, we also really appreciate good food - and we were fed sooo incredibly well. The meals on the tour were definitely the best we had in Morocco. The accommodation was also super nice for all the nights and we even got to camp out under the stars in the desert one night! Bachir was our guide but quickly became our friend and he is just one of the nicest and most caring people you'll ever meet, and to top it all off, he's really hilarious too. He told us so much about Sahara life and the culture, and was always willing to go the extra mile to make sure we had a good time. In fact, after our tour we had a couple of days in Marrakech and he actually met up with us so we could all have lunch together and ended up taking us to the airport. The tour is also perfectly flexible. You can tell the company what you would like to see and they can tailor it for you, and you don't need to follow the itinerary exactly if you don't want to. Bachir was really easygoing about changing the itinerary if we wanted to but we trusted the company to come up with the best route!I could not rave on more about this tour, and Bachir in particular. I will definitely be back here for longer next time and do another longer tour with Arib Voyages!"

The great thing was that they completely modified it to our wishes. We arrived in the evening on Marrakesh airport. Omar was there to pick us up and directly took us for a 4 hour drive to hotel Caravane (realy a great place to relax by the way) near Ait ben haddou.In the next 2 days Omar drove us around and simply brought us anywhere we wanted in an extremely relaxed way. He showed us great places (like the road from Ait ben haddou to Telouet and the local market in the Zat valley), seeing and experiencing Morocco's beautiful culture. And next to that Omar was very relaxed. Starting late wasn't a problem. Changing plans along the way neither. And did I say Omar was relaxed? :)Conclusion: great tour, great guide, highly recommended!"

It was a complete eye-opener and seeing all the different landscapes of the desert. The desert itself is vast and unlike some of the more frequented and 'touristy' Merzouga (so we been told by many). Although there is a 9-10 hour car journey there, it felt much less because it was so enjoyable as you go through the different landscapes through the high atlas and draa valley before reaching the desert. The experience was unforgettable and definitely the best thing we did in Marrakech. Our guide Bachir was so wonderful - informative, super-friendly, laid back, thoughtful and a really full and well rounded knowledge and experience of Morrocco. It was an absolute delight to have spent three days with him. Overall, a must-do!"

He's also a musician when he's not running his tour company, so we were lucky enough to get a full rundown on Saharan music! So much so that we made a point of visiting a music store in Essaouira to purchase some of the must-have, fantastic indigenous music! The four wheel drive car was clean, spacious and comfortable, and we were not rushed or made to visit factories.

The hotel assured us that the tour company they use was the best, Arib Voyages as we found out later, and so right they were. Bashir, who was our guide and driver for the day, picked us up from the hotel and we shortly found ourselves in a very comfortable 'land cruiser' heading out of Marrakech on our own private tour.Over eight hours we visited the manic Saturday market in Asni, followed by an easy but very pleasurable two-hour walk in the hills around Imlil in the High Atlas mountains with a local guide, Hussein. Imlil is the starting point to climb snow-covered Mount Toubkal, the highest mountain in North Africa. Finally we had a long late lunch, in the open, provided by a Berber family in a remote village high up in the mountains. As it was only us on the tour, it wasn't cheap but it was very good value. Bashir was a very interesting man, and answered our many many questions, so we found out a lot about Morocca, the culture, and his family. He also drove carefully. Arib Voyages operates a wide variety of tours, and if we return to Morocco, a longer trip to the desert, with this company, would be a must."

It would be a mistake to be planning a trip to the High Atlas Mountain and the dessert (or perhaps any excursion outside of Marrakech) and not book Arib Voyages! As beautiful and amazing as any trip to Morocco can be, working with this company and our driver and guide, Omar, made it the even more memorable. I felt at easy from my very first email with the company. Their responses were prompt, full of information and suggestions on how to get the most our of time in country. Our 3 day, 2 night excursion to the mountains and dessert was a festival of experiences, sights, tastes and information. I encourage you not to plan a shorter trip to the south.Yes, many of these trips are planned and probably run hundreds of times a year but you would not know it. Omar was enthusiastic and very friendly. Often engaging our 2 teenage boys (who in the end offered to show him around our hometown if he was ever over!) and ensured that they had an excellent time as well. As Omar quickly got to know us he made suggestions and adjustments in the itinerary to add things he thought would interest us more and cut other things the wouldn't short (not sure anyone really needs 2 hours on a camel! 1 was plenty...). He also helped eat the local foods we wanted, shop for scarves, dates and pottery in shops that knew him well, and joined us at the top of the dunes for surfing and a spectacular sunset. Although the driving can be long hours, Omar is an excellent driver on all terrains. He is also from M'hmid and knows the all the areas we drove through intimately. He kept us going with information and updates, great music (even let our son plug-in his iPod), extra stops in beautiful vistas, and for coffee/tea. He encouraged us to ask for additional stops whenever we wanted more photos or breaks. He was ready and open for everything! The hotel in Zagora the first night was a great choice - clean, comfortable and relaxing. Omar was very kind to us all and we ended our trip feeling fortunate and grateful for all the time and energy that was put into sharing his Morocco with us. The next day for returning to Marrakech Omar called me at the Riad, I had forgotten a favorite hat in the car. He quickly offered to bring it by that evening, we were out and I missed its delivery but I would have been pleased to see and thank him again for everything. I priced many tour companies and all-in Arib was the most competitive. As all the reviews testify, they do a tremendous job picking the routes and providing friendly and smart guides. Omar and Arib, and the adventure the guide you on could very well wind-up being the past part of your Moroccan adventure."

After two rather hectic days in Marrakesh my girlfriend and I got picked up from our Guide Mokhtar for a 4 day journey through the South East of Morocco. Starting in Marrakesh (straight in front of the Kasbah) the journey took us to so many stunning places and panoramic views, to local restaurants, the Sahara, the best kebab place of Morocco, a surprisingly comfortable camp in the Sahara with a camel ride and perfect sunset/sunrise in the dunes. A completer description of all the nice things we experienced is just not possible, you have to experience it by yourself. Mokhtar was a fairy tale guide. Questions lead to beautiful stories, jokes and fun were daily business. He knew the landscape, the best places for stunning views, the best local restaurants, the dunes, the country and its moving history, the nomads and the Moroccan life and was always there when needed. The perfect service / organisation as well as the luxury 4x4 Land Rover were just adding to an unforgettable experience. Trying to find the time for a longer stay next year since this part of the trip was clearly our most beloved one. Thanks Mokhtar for all your efforts and the great time, we miss you already. We can only recommend Arib Voyages to everybody!! Preshika & Max(Aisha & Ahmed)"

We decided to go with Arib Voyages because they are really patient in answering all our questions, also reasonable price, and suggested a good desert. I am so glad we choose Arib V, we are taken very good care of thoughout the trip. though leaving from a 5-star hotel in Marrakech, we have never seen a better car than ours! Its a long journey to the desert, trust me, you have to go with a comfortable car! You won't want to suffer in Sahara.Many of my friend who went there before warn me: you never fallen asleep at night. Later I realized that's because the tour they went doesn't have good camping facility. They are sleeping on the ground, whereas we were sleeping on bed. Also in their pictures, it's camping site everywhere. But the place we went is a REAL desert. I won't go Sahara very often, good that I saw the real one the first time.I already recommended them to my friends who are going next month. Morocco is an amazing place, and our tour to the desert is definitely the highlight. Any question, feel free to contact me :)"

Family of four...two children aged 7 and 4..we contacted arib voyages after seeing the reviews on here...the day before we called and booked for the following day. Basheer came to pick us up from our hotel apologising for being five minute delayed.we were taken to Atlas mountains....but he allowed us to stop as and when we wanted to. We had a camel ride, went to a private home to have lunch. I was sceptical due to my taste buds and not liking tajine dish when i had tasted it at a restaurant.However, the home made one was amazing.Basheer was very nice, he explained lots of cultural norms and history of the local people Berbers.Our 4year old was inquisitive but Basheer never failed to respond to him without a smile and warmth. We as parents get fed up..but Basheer never.Basheer was very courteous all the time..his english is better than the queen.Basheer very kindly allowed us to stop and buy books..pencils for children and sweets at our chosen shops that we spotted on our journey.The people..and children living in the mountains were extremely grateful for the books..pencils..and sweets.The smile on these childrens faces was priceless.The scenery was amazing.Both our children learnt how poor people live in Morocco and our daughter was educated by seeing how people are grateful for a simple life and simple gift.i would not hesitate to go alone with Basheer as he is very respectful and takes good care of people.I am not naiive and travel alot...i hav an occupation that involves working with people daily and building my own knowledge and training so i can observe people quickly.Our children said this was the best day of their holiday..and as parents we were extremely touched by what we saw with Basheers assistance.For the price it is excellent value and i would not hesitate to pay double for the experience we have had.Now we plan to go again... but for the sahara with Basheer. He is an amazing man that helped us touch the lives of other people and give us an experience that we will never forget and cherish."

We sat in a comfortable 4x4 and headed to the Atlas Mountains on the first day, and stopped at Ouarzazate before arriving in Erg Lihoudi for a comfortable night stay in a tent in the dessert. We tasted great Moroccan cuisine, chicken in tagine, salad. My friend was vegetarian and they managed to prepare tasty aubergines in tagine. He also felt carsick along the way and our driver was careful enough to ensure smooth driving along the bends at slower speed. Our guide was very knowledgeable with Moroccan history and politics, and very friendly. We had quite a long camel ride through the dunes in the desert. You either love this or hate this. They gave rides long enough to satisfy most ride lovers. The dunes are like nothing we've seen before. It was an incredible experience. The night at the dessert was amazing. The stars were out at full force by 3-4am, we woke up in the middle of the night to take a look. The next morning we had tasty scrambled eggs Moroccan style in a tagine as well. The trip to Kasbah of Ait Ben Haddou was also immensely fascinating. Our guide gave an extremely detailed history of the place. Our tour ended before nightfall and he brought us to a great local Moroccan place selling very good seafood at reasonable prices. We had grilled fish and calamari. After the tour another of my friends also left an extremely important toiletries (containing contact lenses, spectacles etc.) bag in the car. Our guide only realised after sending us back to our hotel and reaching home. He drove all the way back to the hotel to return it to us. We really appreciate his dedication and commitment to making our trip in Morocco a great experience.Ultimately we enjoyed the the desert most, Arib Voyages gave us excellent tours and it was certainly worth seeing."

We went through beautiful Atlas montains, Vall\u00e9e Du Draa and Sahara. Especially the stay in Erg Chegaga was magical, surely worth every hour in the car, with its impressive sand dunes and starry night. Our guide Bashir was such a darling - knowledgeable, helpful and fun to hang out with. Even though we felt we were in an Indiana Jones movie most of the time, we also felt safe and well looked after. I would not hesitate to make the same trip with kids. I can highly recommend Arib Voyages."

After the days we have shared with them, It has being more similar to \"a trip with friends\" rather than \"a hired tour\".By this is strange this review. I would like to share the kindness or the things I learn, but for most of you what would be more interesting is the process of this feeling.We wanted to go to the Merzouga desert, we send may mails to different companies we tell them we were looking for and \"active trip\" (kind of adventure). As we have seen many reviews of that place on trip advisor and we were looking forward to be there. Take a decision was not easy. Many companies, similar information, but when we spoke with them they told us the differences between the Merzouga and Erg Chegaga, the distances (Erg Chegaga is quite bigger), the activities... and finally they told us that they have born in that desert. The people from Arib Voyages are originally Nomads from that area. This means, no GPS is required, everyone knows them, you can meet their friends or know their history. They help us to understand many things that from our culture and history were unknown for us.After the first day no more questions about \"next stop\" were made. We let Mokhtar decide for everything and every moment was perfect. The fortified Berber Kasbah, the sandboard on the desert, the songs at night or the camel trip. 3 perfect days to go through Marrakech, to the desert of Erg Chegaga to cross 180 km of Sahara on 4X4.We even had a great moment sharing tea with a group of Nomads we found on a fountain on the desert.My advice, for other tourist.Go to Erg Chegaga, open your mind, and relax."

We went there last December, spending New Year's Eve at the Sahara and having an unforgettable entry to 2013.Bachir makes sure that the experience is very complete, educational and fun. The trip included: trip to the Sahara from Marrakesh (crossing the amazing Atlas mountains), visit to a Kasbah, camel ride, local market, oasis, sandboarding, local food and music, all with the insightful and fun explanations of Bachir.Bachir is very flexible and accommodates the schedule (to the extent possible) so that you can relax, have fun and learn at the same time. Being a local Berber himself, Bachir provides first-hand information of the local lifestyle and customs.We would love to go there again with him on one of the different trip options that his company offers."

Arib voyages offer the absolute best trips around Morocco and we did the three day two night chegaga tour with Mokhtar.All the emails beforehand were very helpful and they can always plan around your requirements we for example were met straight at the airport and were dropped off at our riad in Marrakech.Our group was four English twenty somethings and Mokhtar was a great guide giving us lots of information and knowing when to let us relax and when to get us up (impromtu dances in the desert). We ate at some amazing places and the riad in Zagora and the camp in the desert were both excellent. There is lots of driving involved but it is comfortable and the music is great! The best thing about the team at arib voyages is they are a family who really love the Sahara as it is in their bones and they do everything they can to ensure you have the best experience/adventure. You can get to the sahara cheaper but you cannot see it better or with more passion than the small group tours offered by arib voyages.Thank you again Mokhtar for letting us meet your family and having tea and tagine and for the camel journey and ait benhaddou and for letting us sleep under the stars in the sahara and for sand boarding and all for all the insight and fun. We even got a free gift.Definitely book your tour with arib voyages!"

He was able to make the night in the desert in a \"luxury tent\" an unforgetful experience. He is not only a good driver and knowledgeable tour guide (fluent in Arabic, French and English and now some German as well), he also has a very good sense of humour and at the same time knows when to be serious. A true professional who became a friend over the many stories we traded, allowing insight into his authentic upbringing. Highly recommended and we will definitely contact him again during our next visit!"

Beforehand we were wondering whether to take a roup trip or a private trip and gladfully we opted for an individual trip with Arib Voyages, not because we don't like social contacts but we dislike mass tourism and people trying to sell a lot of things. Mokhtar helped us to avoid this and brought us to places we saw no other tourist (in September 2013). Right now we are considering a future trip to the Sahara for more valuable encounters with the Arab people and nature."

A pleasant man, wearing a traditional Moroccan gondora and a big smile. In a comfy SUV, we hit the dusty road. One the road we got a glimpse of the daily life of rural Moroccans; mothers covered in jeballas holding their young children's hands while carrying a big sac full of vegetables on their head, men guiding the mules carrying items and teaching their sons their trade along the dusty roads under the scorching sun. The road started ascending on Atlas mountains, the weather got cooler, the nature got greener. Small and large villages perched on mountainsides with a minaret marking the town center. As we descended, the nature became more barren. On the way we visited Aid Venhaddou, a well preserved 17th century village which has been a backdrop of many Hollywood movies, most recently in Game of Thrones. After we reached M'Hamid, the last Southeastern town, the paved road ends and a narrow dirt road takes us closer to Sahara. This is where the magic starts. Slowly, the barren dry flat lands give way to sand. Smaller sand dunes anchored around some desert vegetation become larger and larger. Around another sand dune, we see two camels and two young Berber Moroccans awaiting us. Our guide leaves us with them and leaves. Our journey through Sahara begins! Mustafa and Magder wrap turbans around our heads and we mount the camels. Through large and small dunes we trek approximately for 2 hours, deeper and deeper into the desert, into the endless sands. The sun is merciless, small sandstorm firm and die I'm the horizon. The \"dance\" of sands forming the ripples is fascinating, the grace of the camel carrying us and oursupplies is appreciated. Incredibly, our guides know exactly where to take us. We finally reach the cluster of tents setup for us and some permanent residents just before sunset. We get off the camels and run towards the highest sands dune in site. The view is mesmerizing... just sand and the sun. We snap a few photos and watch the majestic sun melt into the sands. As we come down the dunes our Moroccan Tagine dinner is served outdoors. We eat in peace and take in the magic of Sahara. Slowly the stars fill the pristine sky. I have never seen the sky filed such bright stars. The temperature drops to perfect; the warmth of the sands is pleasant. We lie down on carpets and watch the stars for hours. A cool breeze fills the air, a complete silence sets in. Just sand and the stars - it's like restart for your soul. Your head gets clearer and you realize how lucky you are to live on this beautiful planet. We feel asleep on the sand, under the stars."

Meals were brilliant too, lots of Tagine!One thing I'd say if you do the tour, is to bring along some books for the children in the villages, occasionally they did beg for money or sweets, but it's better for the communities to give them something more beneficial.We couldn't have asked for a nicer guy to show us around.

I recently took a trip for two weeks to Morocco with my two sisters- without a doubt, the highlight of our trip was with Bachir and Arib Voyages on our three day excursion to Erg Chigaga!! Being three girls traveling during Ramada, we were a bit concerned that we wouldn't get the full Saharan experience, but we could not have been more wrong. From the moment Bachir promptly picked us up from our Riad to the time he dropped us off we could not have asked for anything more of our tour. Throughout the three days, Bachir treated us like old friends while being extremely professional and knowledgeable, he always had an answer for our never ending list of questions- his laid back personality put all three of us instantly at ease. The accommodations for the two nights were also wonderful, the first night we stayed a hotel in Zagoura where we were able to swim before dinner in order to break up the Sahara summer heat. The second night, we stayed at the Camp in the Sahara which was on the edge of the erg chigaga sand dunes where we had nothing short of a spectacular experience. After arriving at camp, the three of us were immediately given camels which we rode to one of the higher dunes in order to sit and watch the sunset. On returning to camp, we sat, drank tea took in the beauty of the Sahara, and learned more about Bachir's life growing up as a Bedouin- he could not have been more open or gracious as we talked about his and his families life . After tea, we enjoyed a dinner of one of the best Tangiers of our entire trip. Post dinner Bachir showed us how to Sand board, after which, we all laid atop a sand dune talking and enjoying the beautiful sky. The entire experience with Arib Voyages was flawless and amazing- We could not have asked for a better guide, better accommodations, or a better time. If you are browsing reviews in order to find the best tour company, do yourself a favor and book with Arib Voyages. Also, besides being a wonderful tour company, is family run and operated by Bachir and his brothers and cousins. All three of us without a doubt considered the Sahara and Bachir to be the best part of our trip!!!!!"

            "review": "The Magic of South Morocco. We visited a good portion of South Morocco with Arib Voyages Day Tours this past September. The trip took seven days/six nights, and each of them was filled with wonder, beauty, and a constant sense of discovery and perfection. Our guide, Mokhtar, was knowledgeable, funny, and generous and helped us appreciate the complete beauty of Morocco, a land filled with light, pure skies, and endless wonders. The trip was well organized and thought out. If anything, we would have liked spending more time in each location, but our schedule didn't allow for it. We highly recommend Arib Voyages, especially if you look for an experience that is not too touristy. We found Mokhtar extremely flexible and accommodating. Based on our experience, as long as you are clear on what you want to accomplish during your trip and communicate it, Mokhtar will do his best to ensure you have the most wonderful time in Morocco.Massimo & Cinzia"

I can honestly say that this is an excellent family-owned company that has an incredible service and the ability to change things as needed or desired by the group. I found the experience to be quite genuine, the guides and people incredibly nice and the facilities very comfortable. This is definitely the way to experience the Sahara. We all found the three days in the desert way more exciting than our stay in Marrakech. Great job overall, Arib Voyages. Keep it up."

I traveled with my husband, daughter and in-laws with our amazingly patient and thoughtful guide, Bachir, on a three (3) day tour to Ebi Chegaga. Concerns I had prior to booking this trip included the comfort of the transportation and accommodations. To say the least all expectations were surpassed. We had the vehicle to ourselves (family), it was spacious enough to accommodate us all and my daughter surprisingly, never got antsy.We later met up with Bachir's brother (Arib Voyages is family owned!..love that) and his group of travelers which followed us in and out of the desert. It was a small group which made it intimate at camp and easy on the camel ride.If you think it sounds crazy to travel oversees with a 2-year old, and even more so to the Sahara...rest assure it can be done, and you may be pleasantly surprised at how much they'll enjoy it. I'd also like to give credit to the guides of Arib Voyages for babysitting at times and being so patient...that is with my in-laws..not my 2-year old!"

            "review": "Once in a lifetime experience. Like so many others on TripAdvisor, we had the most amazing experience with Arib Voyages and I would thoroughly recommend this to anyone. I have never booked a guide before, but as a woman travelling with my teenage son and wanting to do something fun and adventurous in the Sahara and based on all the other great reviews here, we booked a 3 day trip with Arib Voyages. We had Bachir as our guide - and in three days he stole our hearts with his outgoing personality, his knowledge of the region and extended family (everyone in Mhamid seems to be some kind of relation of Bachir!). My teenage son also loved the experience - I won't list it all, but included sand-boarding in the desert, camel rides, spotting camels and lizards in the desert, tea in the Kasbah at Mhamid, crossing the desert, buying dates by the roadside in the Draa Valley. As well as being a lot of fun, Bachir was very professional and we felt as if we were in safe hands with him and his marvellous 4x4. Some concrete tips for anyone considering going (particularly women with teenage sons)- the further south we got, the more the women were covered up. Normally I would wear shorts and a t-shirt for any kind of sporty activity, but I wore long-sleeved shirt and long linen trousers and was very comfortable this way (especially walking around the Kasbah at Mhamid). I'll note that I was travelling in October and the temperature was in the twenties. - I had packed my heavy mountain boots and a pair of light sandals as I wasn't sure what I'd need. In the end the sandals were good for walking around, and in the desert we went bare foot (the sand is beautifully clean - feels wonderful!). - Was a lot of driving in three days (we went from Ouarzazate down to the Sahara and back up) and I had been concerned that my boy would be bored, but the scenery was just magnificent (punctuated by the odd camel siting) and we had lots of stops and we both loved it. - the facilities at the desert camps were a lot more advanced than I'd been expecting. Real beds, real toilets, even a shower (don't get your hopes up too much though - you are in the middle of the desert). But as I'd been expecting nothing more than a spade I was quite surprised at how well kitted out they were! If you're fussy about sleeping in sandy sheets, you might want to bring a sleeping bag liner or something like that. - Bachir/your guide will advise you on how much water to bring with you. I'm normally a big fan of tap water but I used bottled water consistently for drinking and teeth brushing. - Of all the things, we had a small desert storm during our camel trip. Normally I would never go on a trip without an extra warm thing but I got caught short this time! We had also bought turbans (of course) and these proved excellent against the sand and sun.We both loved the experience and felt like a light had gone out when Bachir left us to return to his family. Please feel free to write if you have any other questions."

Marocco is extremely beautiful and the tour is also great ! Bachir was not our guide but from the few times we spoke he was very proffesional , honest and very friendly. According our guide Mohammed , he must try to be more proffesional , friendly and also to learn better English . Also he has to realize that flerting with clients is not good for him ( ..he asked my friend for a date !!! ) . Anyway , my rating is- very good - because the tour was unique ( especially the Gorges and ofcourse Sahara ! ) and bachir was more than good with us . Overall i recommend Arib Voyages !"

I took a 3 day trip with Arib voyages from Marrakech to the Sahara and back to Marrakech, via Zagora, M'hamid and many other interesting towns and villages. Without a doubt, it was the highlight of my holiday in Morocco. I got to see so many beautiful parts of Morocco and meet a wide range of people who are always willing to teach you more about their culture and heritage. The Sahara was one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. We got to go sand boarding there, had some live Berber music and got to sleep underneath the stars which was just amazing. There is a lot of driving over the three days but it is never boring as the scenery is so beautiful and constantly changing. There are plenty of photo stops, bathroom breaks and opportunities to buy water along the way. Bachir, our guide, was one of the friendliest, most interesting people I have ever met and he made sure that we were always getting the most out of our trip, as well as being very knowledgeable about each particular area. I would definitely recommend taking a trip with Arib Voyages and am looking forward to exploring more of Morocco with them in the future!"

We didn't know what to expect on our trip but the owner of our riad told us we had made a great choice with Arib voyages. And so it proved. Bachir instantly reassured me with his professionalism and good humour and we had three amazing days away in his company exploring rural Morocco. I was alittle nervous about spending two nights in the desert tents so Bachir was able to effortlessly alter our itinerary so one night was spent in a hotel. However I need not have worried about the desert accommodation as it was very comfortable. The three days we spent with Bachir was the highlight of our holiday in Morocco - we learned a lot about the people and customs and it was a relief to get away from the street vendors and meet friendly Moroccans. Our daughter (22) was with us and she and Bachir had great fun with arabic lessons along the way and there was lots of laughing. The time in the Sahara was truly wonderful -the comfortable accommodation, wonderful food, Moroccan music and the beauty of the dunes. We loved the camel ride as well!At the end of the trip it felt very sad to say goodbye to Bachir as he had become a friend. He came the next day to take my daughter to the airport and he also arranged transport to the airport for us, all unasked. If you are planning to take a trip to Morocco and wondering about a day tour or a longer tour I can thoroughly recommend Arib Voyages - you will meet a guide but leave a friend in Morocco.Pete and Lorna (from New Zealand)"

The amazing views were almost too much to take in in just a few days, starting a short distance from Marrakech and continuing all the way to the desert, while the desert itself was one of the most lovely experiences we have had. Bachir knew the answer to any question we could proffer, volunteered loads of fascinating information, and knew just how to keep us in the best possible mood - geeing us up when we needed it while giving us space to relax also. He was such a friendly and genuine guy that we felt instantly at home with him and felt we'd left a friend behind when we got back to Marrakech!For me the highlights of the trip (among a constant parade of scenic wonders) were the villages and towns near the Sahara, which were so unlike both the world we know and the rest of Marrakech and in which the people seemed very natural and friendly, and of course the Sahara itself. Words can't quite do justice to what it was like to sleep under the stars, to see the light of the moon over the dunes, and above all to experience the unique atmosphere and peacefulness of isolation.We would love to come back to Morocco and spend more time with Bachir, particularly in the desert!"

Our guide was Muchktar, very friendly and very informative about the local area.We went to visit Ouireka Valley, and it was such an experience although would not recommend to people afraid of heights as we had to climb some rocks to get to the waterfall. It's the climbing that was the highlight and getting to the waterfall was like an achievement. The Valleys, hills/mountains are very picturesque and beautiful... Our tour guide was flexible willing to stop whenever we wanted to take pictures etcIf Arib Tour wants to stand out from the crowd (as there a lot of tour operators) they should include refreshments, camel ride and a tour of Marrakech in their package) as there is so much to explore and see round Marrakech and so much to do. Also would recommend that they have a compherensive First Aid kit in case of snake bites etc as the hills/mountains were full of snakes, small creatures.Otherwise we enjoyed the day and would recommend it to anyone else interested."

The organization was flexible, able to work around my schedule and arrange activities around my timeline and trip goals. I felt connected to the culture in ways that wouldn't have been possible if I had attempted to explore the sights and landscape on my own, and sleeping out under the stars at Erg Chigaga, as well as being invited to share tea with locals, are experiences I'll never forget. I'm not surprised that this organization was recommended by several backpackers I met and the fact that the guide had ties to the communities I visited gave the trip an authentic feel.Arib Voyages organizes several day and overnight tours but I would definitely recommend the overnight at Erg Chigaga to appreciate the vast beauty of the Sahara. The drive there is also wonderful, passing through the Atlas Mountains and Draa Valley, both of which are alive with culture and ancient history. They will also be happy to arrange a ride on a dromedary, a single-humped camel, something that is not to be missed. I could not recommend this organization more."

He kept the tour entertaining while adding in personal experiences and enlightening us with his cultural. We only had a day to spend so Bachir made accomendations so that we when we immediately arrived at the camp, camels greeted up. He timed it so perfectly that while on the camels the sun was setting. When we arrived back at the camp we climbed to the highest sand dune and took as many pictures as possible to document this experience. When we were finished we played football with Bachir and his cousins and then slept under the stars as Bachir pointed to the constellations. This experience couldn't have been any better.

It was actually the highlight of my 34 day trip throughout Europe and Morocco. A group of 4 (3 women and 1 man) took the two-day one-night trip to the Sahara Desert. Bachir was great, he related to us, told us a bit of history, and made the experience even more enjoyable. Once we arrived at camp he asked if we wanted to ride camels then instead of waiting until the morning. Just an example of how accommodating the tour is! They prepared us a fabulous dinner and seriously had me questioning if they had indeed cooked our meal in the desert--it rivaled the restaurants in the city of Marrakesh. Sleeping under the stars at the camp was the most awe-inspiring moment of the tour. I really enjoyed myself, as did my friends. Our tour guide Bachir became more like a friend than a tour guide. I would HIGHLY recommend this company. They were very prompt in picking us up from our not-so-easy-to-locate riad, everything that they said to be included was included, and the guides were very professional but also very personal. If you are looking for a reputable company with stand-up employees, look no further than Arib Voyages."

If you want to feel relaxed and that you are being shown around the home town and country of a good friend then book a tour with Bachir and his colleagues. We only had time for one day trip to the Ourika Valley which was superb, however had we known about Arib voyages before our arrival we would have most certainly made time for a 2-5 day trip to the Sahara.Bachir is an ammenable, funny and informative guide. Through him you will not only learn about the place you are visiting but also get a true understanding of life in Morocco. His positivity is inspiring. We travelled up the Ourika valley at a leisurely pace, in a very comfortable 4 by 4, two of us and Bachir. We stopped whenever we chose on the journey to take in beautiful views of the atlas or to sample cactus fruit for the first time. Once reaching our destination we walked to the seven waterfalls with the help of a very able guide called Hassan- who made us feel very safe climbing up to the first and second waterfalls. Upon return to the village below called Setti Fatma we had a 3 course relaxing and delicious lunch ( included in the fee for the tour) at a restaurant by the river. Then on our journey back to Marrakech we stopped to swim in the river and drink mint tea- Bachir arranged for us to drink tea in the river which will be a very funny lasting memory. We set the pace ourselves and learnt so much on this trip, we only wish we had more time to book further excursions with Bachir and Arib Voyages- next time!As Bachir said- he sees clients as friends- and this is the feeling you are left with and is shared by all the other positive reviews listed before. Do not hesitate to book a longer tour trip with this highly recommended company."

Absolutely amazing, I love mountains, and I didn't wanted to leave that place.

He was not only a very competent guide and driver, but also a very generous and kind host who made us feel very welcome in his country and in his family. During the tour we also spent two nights in two different camps in the Sahara desert: this was an amazing experience both for myself and my husband and our children aged 13 and 11. We rode a camel in the desert and visited a Kasbah on the edge of the Sahara which is still inhabited by almost 200 people. It is difficult to put into words the feelings we experienced meeting the local people and visiting their villages: these memories will stay with us for the rest of our lives. We all feel immensely grateful to Bachir and the whole team at Arib Voyages for making our trip such a unique human experience as well as a wonderful tour with breathtaking scenery of mountains, green valleys and vast palm groves! We enjoyed this part of Morocco so much that we are thinking of organizing another trip next year to visit the imperial cities or the coast and for sure we will contact Bachir and his team as soon as we decide to go back to Morocco!"

It has been almost a month since we have been in Morocco, and not a day goes by that I don't think of our time in the Sahara. Visiting different countries, learning the culture, eating the food, and seeing life through another person's eyes is the perfect recipe for a wonderful experience.My 13 year old son and I, 54 year old mom, booked a 4 day, 3 night tour from Marrakech to Chegaga effortlessly through Arib Voyages. In retrospect we should have spent the week with them, it was that good. But what made it so memorable was Bachir, our guide.(A side note...we travel a lot and I research my trips extensively, and do rely on tripadvisor to narrow my search for hotels, attractions, etc. I have also gone the easy route and booked with Abercrombie & Kent when going to countries that I don't think I can get around myself due to language or terrain. Based on my methods I think that I can speak from experience to say that I did very well with my tour selection in Morocco and thank everyone who wrote about their experiences with Arib tours.)My main concern was ensuring that my teenage son would have a good time. Lured with the promise of \"surfing the Sahara\" on a snowboard would work for only so much, but staying awake for up to 20 hours in a Landcruiser would require something/someone very special. I didn't want him asleep missing what was to be seen ouside the window - which was extreme and magical. Back to Bachir...Bachir, being a Bedouin does not know his exact age but for his time with my son, he was a teenager. They blasted their music while driving through villages, sang, laughed at silly things, goofed around, and \"surfed the Sahara\" together. I couldn't have been happier.This was a trip that had the potential for disaster. It was the furthest thing from a disaster. It was an awesome adventure for both of us. Bachir, besides making sure that my son was having a good time, was punctual, pleasant, extremely knowledgeable, an outstanding driver, patient, (I took over 700 pictures), humble, and genuinely a good person. We met members of his family and his mother made us the best lamb tagine. I could go on, but I think that I have written enough. Enjoy your trip to the Sahara! Bring something back with you other than souvenirs, bring back memories and new friendships."

We were very happy to have seen more than just Marrakech in a trip of only 5 nights. A lovely beach town, with souks and cafes, and fresh air. Its quiet and peaceful with plenty to browse through (easier than in Marrakech) in the 4 or so hours you can spend there. The drive takes you through different sceneries, so you can witness the varied agriculture and smaller towns of Morocco. You stop a couple of times for refreshments or photos and can request to stop off anywhere on the way. Bachir was a fun guide, playing mellow Arabic music during the drive early in the morning and keen to hear our music on the drive home. He had a great sense of humour and is very suited to being a guide in every way. He was informative on Morocco in general, the different cultures and areas, and passionate about music I think! Highly recommend this trip with Arib Voyages, really good memories of the experience, so happy for those!"

The nights in the Sahara were unbelievable silent and calm with a clear sky full of stars, except for our interference while playing music on the traditional instruments with all our new local friends in the camp. Riding the dromedar and climbing huge and large sand dunes completed our Sahara trip. The way back started with driving the 4x4 through deep sand or dry lakes....sometimes a kind of rally feeling was hitting us...Mokthars knowledge of his home is unbeatable. Local guides were completing the experience at historic sites."

He also was very genuine and made me feel very comfortable. I also had the pleasure of meeting his sister who came back with us and she is just like Bashir. Very kind and sincere. We had an amazing lunch in a Kaspar on the way up and another terrific dinner at the campsite (although i couldn't finish half of it).

            "review": "The difference with other companies is... Bachir.. We took a 9 day trip of Southern Morocco with Arib Voyages. Bachir was our guide. That is, we were first met in Marrakech by another guide who took us from there to Zagora. He was a nice guy. But he wasn't the guide we expected. That was Bachir. When we heared we wouldn't meet Bachir the next days - it was during Christmas Holidays and they were very busy- we wrote a mail that evening that we were a bit dissapointed since we chose for Arib Voyages exactly because of reading about his many qualities on Tripadvisor. And we soon learned one of his qualities is also not needing a lot of sleep, because he joined us the next morning having driven from Marrakech practically all night. This is exemplary for the man : when he heared we didn't get the service we had expected, he promptly reacted and drove all night to take away our dissapointment. The rest of the trip was one big highlight. Desert tour in Erg Chegaga, in Erg Chebbi, Todra and Dades Valley, and from there to Ouarzazate and finally Essaouira. Especially the desert tour at Erg Chegaga (Sylvester with a small group around the campfire, New Year's day and evening alone with the 4 of us (parents and two teenage sons, and also 5 camels and two local companions) ), sleeping next to \"our dune\" in a small tent or under the freezing starry sky, was unforgettable.  For us the only dissapointment was that we had expected to do the tour in a 4WD. So we had hoped we would do parts of the tour off-road. Instead we were transported in a luxurious van. This wasn't bad at all, but being an experienced independant traveler myself, and knowing the roads in Morocco are very good quality (we had traveled 4 days in a rented car visiting the south of Agadir) sometimes I felt I could have organised a similar trip without a guide. But in the end we were very happy we had chosen for Bachir anyway : traveling without stress, hardly being harrashed by the ever present salesmen, and being able to sit back and enjoy the magnificent Moroccon landscapes, I really enjoyed this trip as a \"spoilt\" tourist. Also the riads Bachir picked out for us were always atmospheric and really nice. And the last three days Bachir took us to 3 wonderful local restaurants we wouldn't have found by ourselves, for lunch : a crazy barbecue place in the High Atlas on the way to Marrakech, one at the fish market at Essaouira, and the last day a bustling Tajine restaurant close to Agadir. Don't miss them when you are in the neighbourhood!!! With Bachir :-). Also the meals during the desert tour were fantastic, not to forget a wonderful lunch at his family's house, prepared by his sister. But what made this trip truly special was Bachir himself : he's an extraordinary charming, wise, honest and funny young man. Always goodhumoured, always ready to help, always considerate and trying to make his people happy. He simply is a good person. Except when he encounters stupid drivers or policemen :-). That said, he's also a very responible and safe driver. And he's so professional you never feel he's working. If tourism is about getting more than you had expected, even when the expectations are very high, Bachir is the champion."

We started early in Marrakech, and crossed the Atlas mountains, then to M'Hamid and the Sahara to see the sun set on the dunes. The desert offers deep quiet, and horizon to horizon stars. More time is better; stay longer if you can.Travelling with the guidance of a man so clearly tied to the land, the people, and the families of the Sahara is totally enriching. Supporting locally owned businesses for food and rest puts our support where I want it to be. Our desert accommodations were more comfortable than I was expecting. Do your research.

Our Bedouin guide (hate to admit it, but I forgot his name - Ibrahim?) was terrific. He spoke fluent French and English, and he was able to joke around but also communicate important aspects of the history and culture. He stopped whenever we wanted to take photos, use the bathroom or get something to drink. Most importantly, as someone who has done a lot of these types of day tours in different countries, I never felt like he was just giving us his usual perfunctiory routine, expecting a big tip at the end. He was very natural, and it really added a nice touch.My only (HUGE) regret was not having more time, as it was just a long weekend. I would love to go back and do a 3-day desert excursion.

The only slight downside was the huge amount of driving involved in the trip, but the scenery was varied throughout, and watching normal Moroccan life go buy as we drove through towns and villages was very interesting. Bachir also made this entertaining in his own way, getting us to sing along to local music and teaching us some Arabic.If you go to Morrocco, then take a trip in to the countryside, it's a beautiful, safe, country.

He respects the camels we encountered, tells us how his parents and forefathers used them to navigate in the unrelenting heat. He talks about our environmental impact and his observation on how the desert is changing from the 'good'/lush sahara, to its current state dry and arid state. I think listening to his insight alone was worth joining up with them. Did I mention, he's connected to the locals?

I arranged for a 3 day tour into the Sahara during one of the most important holiday's for Islam, feast of the lamb. Rather than turn me down, like some of the other tour companies, Arib Voyages offered the 2 day tour instead. I really appreciated their efforts to work with me given the holiday because I had limitd time in Morocco and could not make any changes to my travel schedule. They also helped to arrange airport transfers and the Riad I stayed in while in Marrakech (Riad Jona).I love photography so the drive, although long, from Marrakech to M'Hamid was brilliant and Muktar & Abdul (driver) allowed me the flexibility to stop and take photos whenever I wanted. They even gave suggestions on some of the better places to stop as well. Initially I thought we would just drive and not stop often but they were great and understood how important it was for me to take photos. On the way back Muktar didn't ride back to Marrakech with me because of the holiday on Monday, but throughout the drive he constantly called Abdul to check where we are and to ask if I was ok and enjoyied myself.Driving through the Atlas mountains, watching the changing landscape, riding my camel into the dunes, seeing the variety of people and interesting daily life activities along the way lead to the most magical night, star gazing in the Sahara. I was the only person in the camp and felt very comfortable.

Everyone in town knew his name and he tousled the hair of passing youngsters and traded jabs with the old shop owners. Unlike the city, the sales pressure was low key, and the Riad we ate in was gorgeous, and the food was some of the best we had the entire trip. Very healthy portions. We met back up with Bachir, and stopped on the road to let some locals gather up walnuts they were felling from branches over the road. They were grateful we stopped, so gave us two heaping handfuls of fresh walnuts. We drove up from the verdant valley to a desert plateau. More beautiful and unique scenery, and we learned some Moroccan Arabic and learned about Bashir's desert wandering family. Through the plateau we saw some children hitch-hiking on their way back from school (usually a 5 mile walk in the baking sun), and Bachir asked if we should pick them up. We, of course, agreed and Bachir taught them some English, and we gave them our remaining walnuts as a treat. More rugged and breath-taking scenes as we descended down the other side of the plateau to the lake. Once back at our hotel we said a sad goodbye, and wished that everyday in this historic place could have been so enjoyable.Thanks so much Bachir for such an amazing trip! And if we were ever heading back to Morocco, we wouldn't think twice in booking another trip with Arib Voyages. Easily the best, and most unique tour we have ever been on!-- Jason and Tiffany"

I cannot begin to explain how this day tour totally changed my holiday to Morocco from awful to absolutely AMAZING!!!! My wife and I had the best guide ever. Muktar was great! A very patient guy with the warmest heart. We spoke all the way to the Atlas and all the way back. He stopped every single time I asked him so that I could do my photography and I can be a bit spoilt at times. Yet Muktar was tres patient! He even stopped when he thought there was a scene that I would have liked to shoot. He took us to the cooperative as my wife had inquired about Argan oil.When we reached the mountains, we had another amazing guide, Hussein (spelling) who also was humble and very knowledgeable. Hussein was also sensitive to the fact that my wife is not the bravest fittest sportswoman. He helped her along the way as some of the tracks were quite steep and perilous. Yet he made it fun! He also stopped endlessly to entertain my photography. We stopped at a Berber house/ village for the legendary mint tea but I can attest that the walnuts I tasted there were the freshest and best I have EVER had in my entire life (I eat them everyday). Lunch on the terrace was fabulous and tasty but TOO MUCH. Neither of us ate all of our couscous with chicken and vegetables.The descent through Moulay Brahim was even more spectacular...paradiasical to say the least. It was heaven on earth LITERALLY and nothing I ever read or saw in books or photos could have prepared me for the sights I beheld. Thanks Mutkar!We clapped hands and rocked to the melodies and beats of the Sahara on Muktar's stereo! Muktar was ever so kind when he offered to take us to the airport the next day as we hadn't had a chance to book a taxi. We greeted as businessmen and parted as friends. Muktar, my tuareg copain, even gave us Saharan names, Fatima and Omar. We no doubt will cross paths again.Choukrane! Dom and Trish (Omar and Fatima)"

Me and my friend booked our trip to Marrakech for 5 days and thought we would venture out and check some other places in Morocco. As two young females, I suppose we were quite cautious. Arib Voyages is simply the best. My only regret is I wished we had booked more than one tour with them. We booked the trip to Imlil as we had emailed Arib Voyages and asked which one was the recommended day trip. The honesty was much appreciated and it certainly wasn't about the money for this company. The communication was brilliant via email and so reliable. Bachir turned up to our hotel on time and was so polite and friendly. We had a fantastic day. Bachir stopped many times at our request and of his own accord to allow us to take photos. We had another tour guide arranged for us in Imlil and did a hike, rode on mules, had a lovely lunch and on the way back to Marrakech we even stopped off many times to take scenic photos. Bachir was so respectful. We have stayed in touch with Bachir and hope to go back for a few nights in the desert!! You certainly won't regret booking with Arib Voyages, full of knowledge and friendly."

Riad Jona proposed us to meet with Bachir from Arib Voyages. He offered 2 options of day trips and we choose The Ourika Valley, 50 km far from Marrakech. Bachir was very competent, sevice-oriented and with very interesting explanation about inhabitants and heritage from past Morrocan tribes. At the Ourika Valley we ate in the river then climbed the mountain to the waterfall. A great experience that we enjoyed a lot ! I did a second day trip alone as my friend was busy for the day. As a woman I did not feel confortable to organize day-trip on my own, especially in a muslim country. I contacted Arib Voyages and Bechir agreed to organize a day-trip to Essaouira for me. It was a great experience with a lot of fun. Again, I highly appreciated Bachir competences, In my mind a good trip agency has to propose several options, understand his client expectations, be on time and follow the agreed plan. The guide has to be able to answer all questions regarding his country. This is what Arib Voyage did for our day-trips. We now are dreaming about a desert trip (meharee) of serval days with them .... :-)"

End of September we went with Mokhtar in a SUV from Marrakech through the Atlas mountains seeing different landscapes, the beautiful Dra valley and Kasbahs deep into the Sahara. Since Mokhtar and his team are real Arib nomades they know the Sahara by heart with all its dangers and beauties.However, our trip included breakfasts, dinners and 2 overnight stays. The first night we stayed in a cute Kasbah style hotel in Zagora with a beautiful pool. The second night, which was the highlight, we stayed at the camp in the Sahara in the middle of the Chegaga dunes. After seeing the sunset on top of a very high dune, we spent the night under the sky watching all the stars we never had seen before. Thank you, Arib Voyages for this once in a lifetime experience!!! Next time we will definitely come and do the 7 days camel trip with you!"

Following the excellent reviews on Tripadvisor, we booked a day excursion to the Atlas Mountains and Ouzazarate with Arib Voyages. As arranged, Mokhtar (one half of the Bedouin brothers who own the company) arrived at our RIad at 07:30. This was no mean feat as it can only be reached by foot and isn't easy to find! We were escorted to our personal 4x4 and the journey began. Over the course of the day, we were taken across the Atlas mountains along a hairy road with many hairpin bends - Mokhtar however made the journey relaxing with his conversation about Morocco and the Nomads amongst many other things! We stopped at various look out spots, took a tour of a Kasbah, had a nice lunch overlooking said Kasbah and then went onto Ouzazarate (where we had the option of visiting the film studios where Gladiator was made).We were home by 5,45 with a subsequent recommendation for dinner at Restaurant Oscar - just off the Place Jemaa el Fna, We took up the suggestion and it was great!Overall the day was exactly as described on their website. Mokhtar was at our disposal as and when needed, but equally left us to our own devices when we wanted. We couldn't recommend this company highly enough and if/when we return to Marrakech, we fully intend to embark on a Sahara excursion to meet Mokhtar's parents!"

We went for the two-day trip from Marrakech to the desert: http://www.arib-voyages.com/en/tour-2days-marrakech-mhamid.php and throughly enjoyed it, though we were a little tired and saddle-sore at the end!Bachir, our guide and one of the brothers who owns the firm, arrived at 7am on the dot at our Riad ready for our trip to the desert and he and Hassan, our driver, helped with our luggage and we were off.The scenery was amazing throughout the journey and Bachir knew the good spots to stop for a quick picture (and to stretch our legs), including a Berber village set into the hillside, some breathtaking views across the valleys near the Atlas mountains, the Unesco-protected Ait Ben Haddou and the lush greenery of the Draa valley's dates palms. Remember travel tablets and beware the toothless man with a snake at Ben Haddou!We stopped for a nice lunch at Chez Yacoub in a remarkable old fortified village called Tamnagoult outside Agdz, in a magnificent building and by the end of the afternoon we reached Mhamid (where the road literally came to an end) to find our camels waiting for us. We travelled for an hour or more into the sunset before reaching the camp and the dunes.Bachir and his friends / assistants prepared a tagine for us which we eat under the stars, it was such a fine evening that we also slept under the stars - our bed was pulled out for us and we slept under the brightest night sky imaginable. I'd never seen the Milky way so clearly and hadn't realised that it stretched so far across the sky - it's amazing what the lack of street lighting in the desert can do.We got up around 5:30 the following morning in readiness for the sun's appearance - the next hour and a half or so, watching the dawn in the dunes, was wonderful. A leisurely breakfast followed, then it was time for a shower (honestly! It may have been very far removed from a power shower, but was considerably more than expected, despite being slightly more than a trickle).We were quite glad to get off the camels as we began our return trip, but were very glad that we'd had the experience. The journey back, broken up by a stop at a pottery in Tamegroute, lunch in Ouarzazate and some more well-chosen photo opportunities was as good as the journey out: we saw things from different directions, in different light and at different times of day, which made it as fresh as the journey towards the desert. This was enhanced as my wife felt better on the twisty, turny roads through the mountains on the way back - maybe by the second day she was an experienced mountain traveller?We were back at our Riad for about 7pm on the second day after an outstanding experience. Thank you so much to Bachir for a wonderful couple of days - we're very glad we went with Arib rather than a larger tour company, it's clear that Bachir wants people to see and enjoy his country and his way of life. As a Bedouin he was so clearly at home in the desert and he helped us appreciate its importance."

My partner is a photographer and Bachir was happy to stop whenever we wanted and knew all the best spots.If your in Marrakesh and want to see more outside the city then don't hesitate to book a tour with these guys. Its a great, small family run business and Bachir couldn't be nicer, so helpful and friendly he picked us up from our riad and made sure we got back ok. He even arranged our return transfer to the airport and called us on the way to check we got away ok and to say goodbye! Wouldn't hesitate to book with them again, next time for a longer trip hiking in the Atlas or a trip to the desert. Also on the plus side they are reasonably priced, everything is included (apart from a small tip for the guide and berber home). Other companies charge separatly for tour, guide, lunch etc. so if you want to know what your going to spend this tour is the one for you."

We had a lovely drive into the valley, stopping at a couple of place - but weren't hassled too much, as we were with Bashir. We then had a trek up to the waterfall over small paths, rickety bridges and wet rocks. We had a young guide called Hassan, who was very strong, and helped us both get to the top and down again. It took about one and a half hours, and we needed lunch after that! We ate in a small village, by the river. It was a lovely day, and I have no hesitation in recommending Arib Voyages. If I go back to Morrocco, I would definitely use their services - maybe for a longer trip, to take in the desert."

The 5 day trip with Arib Voyages and Morocco ranks as one of my top five travels to date and that is speaking from someone who has experienced more than 30 countries. My sister and I started our 5 day Southern Morocco trip in Marrakech with Bachir (The Guide) and Hassan (An amazing Driver) and ended up feeling like family by the end! I researched many companies and went with Arib Voyages for two reasons, the Trip Advisor comments and my correspondence with Arib Voyages. I was beyond pleased with my choice and would highly recommend Arib Voyages. Prior to arrival in Morocco, we corresponded back and forth, creating an tour schedule. Briefly, 5 Days, Marrakech over the Atlas; Tinerhir for the Todra Gorge; Sahara Chegaga Dunes; Ouarzazate Sultana Royal Golf; Agadir; Essaouira and back to Marrakech. The high light of the trip was spending qualifty time with my sister in the company of Bachir and Hassan. Not only were they the utmost professionals sharing information about their country and where they grew up but we had a blast!!!! With our request of sites to see, we spent many hours in the car which lent to some of my fondest memories, all of us singing in the car; the windows open, music blasting and a beautiful country to view. This in additon, to sharing tea with Bachir and his family before we hit the Sahara Dessert. If you want guides with 100% knowledge of South Morocco, Bachir and Hassan are the ones! Bachir grew up in a village at the edge of the Sahara Desert, playing there as a child. Hassan also grew up in another village not far away. The Sahara Desert was by far my favorite area in Southern Morroco. The dark red sand, it rained on the way in during June which is uncommon. We spent the night with a bright moon in a camp at the edge of the highest dunes in Morroco- Chegaga Dunes. We had picked up lamb in a local village earlier in the day and Hassan had made Tagine that night for us to eat. The heat was toasty and the camp pulled the cots out into the open and everyone slept out under the stars. Loved waking up at 4:30am before the sunrise, walked up on the dunes alone and sat there until my sister joined me and we watched the sunrise together. It was one of the most beautiful moments, the sun shadowing on the dunes-the pictures and experience was epic. I still remember ths raw silence no residual sound from any where- sheer silence. I still think of that moment during my rat race days now. After two days in the desert, my sister and I were surprised with a lunch made by Hassan's wife vegetable cous cous. We got to meet his wife and children, experiencing a day in the life! This is my favorite part of traveling, getting to know what it is like day in and day out. Both Bachir and Hassan are willing to share, be sure to ask. That night we stayed at a spectacular resort the Royal Sultana-in Ouarzzate highly recommend this place!!! I could spend hours writing about this amazing trip. I do need to note that Bachir and Hassan were more than patient as my sister and I asked to stop for photos, our shopping requests from platters, tagnines, saffron, spices, jewelry and lanterns. Again, many hours of sharing conversation, music and laughter, I truly felt like I had made friends for life in what started as a relationship as a Guide and Driver. We finished our trip back in Marrakech at our hotel the Le Meridien sipping mint Tea, sharing our favorite memory of our 5 day trip and sad good byes with two new friends. Bachir and Hasaan were amazing, Arib Voyages is an amazing outfit that I would highly recommend. (fyi, comfortable, spacious 4 wheel drives with air conditioning of course-)."

I the morning our trip continued towards M'Hamid and the Zahara desert. After two days of sighseeing and several stops in cities, villages, valleys, water falls, and Kasbahs we arrived to M'Hamid, the last stop before the desert. There we bought 5m pieces of fabric which we used as turbans to protect us from the sun and sand. In the evening we arrived to the first camp in the desert where two men had grilled a whole lamb for us. We had tea after the dinner and sat in front of an open fire before we went to sleep in our tents. The next morning we had breakfast and visited an old town riding on camels' back. The next day we went to an oasis where we had lunch and just relaxed in the shadow for hours. In the evening we went to another camp. The next morning we travelled to the third camp which was filled with other tourists. There we were driving around on the dunes with four-wheelers (a kind of four-wheeled scooter), which was kind of fun! The next day we left the desert and went straight back to Marrakech (we arrived in the evening) where we stayed in a wonderful Riadh (old-palace-kind of building)... It was a nice 5 day trip, even though the many hours spent sitting in the car were quite boring... Luckily our tour guides were quite fun! :)"

This wa thought to be our 9 day trip with Arib, and the intention was to stay the rest 6 days in Agadir - which we realised didn't attract us at all - so we arranged we could keep on going around with Arib - that's flexibility isn't it? However, we kept on to the innlands, the Atlas mounains - which had the most spectacular landscapes I\u00a8ve ever seen. We kept on to Marakech and later on to Zagora, in the south, for a short desert adventure in the heat! We would highly recomend them to any interested in going to Morocco, wether it's for a short term or longer as ours. They have a big network of connections and are possible to solv any problems that might occur. They have a lot of knowledge of the history of the country but we very much recomend you to read a book or two, because of the emmence value of historical sighst and cultural fenomena.This was definetly not the last time we went to Morroco, there's still much to explore.

I miss some words to describe it. the only important thing is that you have to lose control. Let the desert take care of you. Silence. nothing to remind you any worry. It might sound a bit cliche but I never saw that much stars... the sky was not even dark! and you imagine that for new year's eve, it's hard to be in the more amazing place!despite only those few days. they managed to take us so far.

Bachir took us through the ourika valley for one day, while Moktar drove us through the atlas mountains, took us to see the old kasbahs, then across to the dades gorge and down to the sahara for two nights. The car was comfortable and safe and we made regular stops along the way to take pictures at absolutely stunning vista spots. The accomodation was carefully chosen, always at nice moroccan style riads with good food and wifi. The highlight of the trip was the sahara - sleeping under the stars in the mud-hut camps and walking the majestic dunes to catch a glimpse of a small corner of la mer du sable. Incredible. The only reason this review isn't five stars is because I am a bit of a history lover and I found the guides lacking in historical context/explanation at some points, especially around the kasbahs for example. It would have been nice to go into detail about how people lived in the kasbahs - which rooms were for what, for example. Otherwise a really great trip - morocco speaks for itself!"

            "review": "I did it again... have been on tour with Arib Voyages!. Returned to Morocco with my 3 of my friends and had a great time travelling around doing \"the Great Tour\" with Arib Voyages. We were welcomed by Arib Voyages upon our arrival to the pink city, Marrakech. After a good night sleep and breakfast in a Riad we were heading to the High Atlas. Wonderful views for everybody who is interested in photografing. Visited Ait Ben Haddou, a ancient fortified Kasbah under UNESCO World Heritage protection. A stop for late lunch in a mountain village where we had a most tasty barbecue, admiring the views around. Arrived to M\u00b4hamid and the Desert in the evening... everything was prepared to welcome us... dinner, tea and music by a fire and the peacefulness of Sahara. Was sleeping like a baby after all we had seen and experienced during the day. In the morning a 3 hours camel tour and visiting local people who invited us for fresh baked bread and minttea! After lunch we climbed on the nearby dunes and visited an oasis where chilling under the palm trees. Life is good! As we wanted to see as much as possible during our 6 days stay, we jumped in to Arib Voyages Jeep with destination Essaouira on the Atlantic coast... on our way there we stopped by some interesting places... like a Saffran village. Our next destination Essaouira is known for it\u00b4s white small houses with blue window shutters, the Atlantic ocean, fishing boats and harbour, the Fort, history and culture. We were told Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa and Leonard Cohen are only some of the celebrities that have been living in Essaouira for shorter periods to find inspiration. This beautiful, little town is very laid back compared to Marrakech. We found some lovely seafood restaurants by the beach and did great bargains in the souk. Driving along the coast road with breathtaking views... visiting amongs others Oualidia and Asafi. Again we were surprised by how much there is to discover in the fragrances and colours Morocco. Arib Voyages make it very easy to travel with them as they took care of all our wishes. Nothing was too much to ask or too complicated. All our requests were fullfilled with a smile."

My sister, my little niece and I, were lucky enough to meet Arib Voyages in Marrakech, who has organised us amazing experience totally adapted at our envy and our possibilities. Travel with a baby can be more difficult, but with Arib Voyges everything has been so easy and we were totally relaxed. Than I had the chance to go in the desert, M'Hamid, where the road stop and where everything start. No words to express the beauty and the silence. Thank you to Bachir and Moktar to have give this precious this time in the middle of no where, but in the real Marocco! Salam and see you soooooon, I hope!"

            "review": "Highlight of our trip!. The Partners in Crime (aka 2 American females) had a great time with Arib Voyages - and specifically, Bachir the Great and Abdu-Andretti, our driver - in Morocco. We went on two day trips with Arib Voyages while we were staying in Marrakech, Morocco. Both day trips included a hotel pick-up and return.Day 1: Atlas mountain tour of the Berber villages in the Ourika Valley. This trip included a hike to a waterfal, lunch at local restaurant, and cooperative shopping (Berber rugs and Argan oil processing). Bachir and Abdu were very professional and gave great cultural and scenic insights.Day 2: Coastal tour of Essaouira, other towns, and drop-off in Casablanca, our final destination. We saw ancient castle canons, ate fish from the sea, dreamed of Hassan, and practiced yoga on the side of the side of the road. Excellent.Additional trip higlights included: frequent stops for photos; and parking areas labelled with 'P,' which Bachir explained is international for parking.We wholeheartedly recommend Arib Voyages to the Marrakechian/desert-type bound tourists. We are also planning a camel trek with Arib Voyages in 2012, although they don't know it yet."

We found Arib Voyages and they recommended us, due to our lack of time, the one day tour to the Atlas mountain. They delivered us everything we expected and more. Their service is very professional and customer friendly. The transport is spacious, safe and clean. And the driver speaks English very well."

            "review": "What a trip!. Me and my two friends found Marrakech a fabulous place to go, and it was mostly thanks to Arib Voyages and specially thanks to Bachir, Hassan and Abidin. They were the tree key people in our trip. Bachir welcomed us with a big smile and cheering words, the first time we met he explained us how our two-day trip to the Sahara will be. Since we were tree women alone traveling in a new country, we were a little bit sceptic about everything, but he comforted us with his words, his knowledge about his country and the details of the tour. Hassan took us to Ouarzazate, Zagora and M'hamid and he was really taking care of us, and making sure that we were pleased all the time. Abidin was the one who took us to the camp in the desert and was always with a smile in the face and sharing his life's filosophy.We also used the transportation service in Marrakech, and it was perfect! In general the whole trip was a great and unforgettable experience, and I hope I can have the opportunity to do it again. I totally recommend to travel with them. Thank you very much for everything :) Arib Voyages!!!!!!!!"

I got in contact with Bachir on thursday evening, travelled to Marocco on saturday and everything went smooth as a clockwork the entire week I used his services.. Transfer from airport, the stay at the riad, the trip to Sahara and the stay with a berber family in the Atlas mountains. I highly recommend them and intend to use the services of them when I visit Marocco next time, was well worth the cost. 'Erik Karlsson, Lule\u00e5, Sweden."

            "review": "Let these guys take the stress out of your trip. We went to Morocco to shoot our new 2012 Spring Summer travel collection (for Icebreaker). We hooked up with Bachir and his crew for 10 days, it was his first time working for a shoot crew and even though there were a few things to iron out early on he really came to the party. We probably weren't the easiest people to work with (we can be demanding) and we were there for work versus holiday so there was a lot to get done. Once we got into the swing of it, everything fell into place.As we were a crew out of New Zealand, we didn't speak the local languages. We couldn't have done this without Bachir \u2014 his interpreting and negotiation skills were tested throughout the journey. As we'd want to shoot with specific people or in certain locations, he would help us find a way to get the shot \u2014 which was amazing. Bachir's drivers Adula, Mohummed amd Abdule were fantastic \u2014 safe at all times, which was our main concern as other shoots we've done in other foreign nations haven't all been a breeze travel wise. These guys also had good quality, modern vehicles that made for comfortable travelling. They were also very accomodating with all the stopping and starting that goes along with a photoshoot. So well done guys.If there was one thing that could be improved... sorry Bachir. The selection of food options got a little bit repetative. For the first 4-5 days Chicken with Lemon Tagine or Lamb with couscous wore a little thin (Bachir will certainly be smiling when he reads this as it became a running joke). Towards the end of the trip, we certainly had more of a selection made available to us and it ended on a good note, well done.All in all, a fantastic experience. I'd love to return to Morocco \u2014 simply to travel. I know that if I go back there I will certainly organise a trip with Arib Voyages. I look forward to the day. Thanks again for the wonderful experience and memories.Regards, Fred.If you'd like to see any images from the journey, go to my flickrwww.flickr.com/photos/41269209@N00/sets/72157626390677038/"

This is a bit off the beat for the rest of the reviews on this tour - but I travelled to Marrakech for a photo shoot and we contracted Arib Voyages to help us navigate this process. We started in Marrakech and travelled to the Atlas Mountains, South Morocco, Morocco Valley Gorge, Fez and the North to Asilah. Our specific guide Bachir who spoke fluent English, was very professional and accommodating to our demanding and ever changing needs. I would love to come back for a trip to the desert as I have heard many stories along the way and it sounds fantastic. I highly recommend Arib Voyages and Bachir!!"

We started our journey in the lively medina of Marrakech where we encountered Bachir Elaammari. joint owner of \u201cArib Voyages\u201d. A travel agency run by 3 Elaammari brothers and specialised in custom-made desert trips. So we put our heads together and listened to the fascinating stories of Bachir. Expressed with a great deal of passion and authenticity towards his native soil, he started working out an itinerary matching both our interests and physical conditions as well as our resides needs. A comfortable 4x4 took us through rough Atlas Mountains, impressive gorges and mysterious fine-looking Kasbahs. The climax of our 5 days trip certainly was our stay in the desert. We never expected to discover so much variety in a landscape we thought to be merely desolate. A hilarious walk on the back of a dromedary brought us to a camp held by three young nomads. Riddles, jokes and culture sharing at a warm camp fire in the middle of the night in a landscape so strange and yet special to us. Full moon and never expected a dark night turned out to be so light.To the entire team of Arib Voyages a big thank you for this unforgettable experience. If we get the opportunity, we\u2019ll definitely come over again."

I'm just back from a trip to the Moroccan desert with arib-voyages and I owe it to them (especially Bachir and Moktar) to write something as good as our trip was (not a small challenge!!!)I've heard of arib-voyages through a friend of mine who went for a trek with them last Easter, so I went on their website, looked at the pictures and there it was I needed to go and take my family with me!I've contacted them and they have been very helpful in offering something to fit our schedule, our taste and the fact that we wanted something just for ourselves (Mum, Dad and my two teenage sisters)After a few days wandering around the busy streets and markets (sorry, souks!) of the pink city, Marrakech, we headed to the great South (well, South East to be precise).Even if the goal of our trip was to reach the desert, I must say that crossing the beautiful Atllas mountains is well worth it too.We finally arrived in the small village of M'Hamid (South East of Ouarzazate) and there the magic begun...For a few days we walked at the pace of the camels from small dunes to wells to big dunes (the view from the top of Zahar dune is spectacular), resting under trees (yes, there are some in the desert!) whilst delicious tajines and \"sand bread\" were being prepared for us.We stopped at dusk, eating by the bonfire, listening to Moktar's beautiful (and really funny sometimes!) storytelling about the lives of his nomadic ancestors, and singing and dancing until it was time to take the time to contemplate the beautiful desert starry skies...Having the opportunity to experience something SO different from busy London life, with my family and with people who really want to share their culture and history in a very friendly and humble way is simply not to be missed:)So there you go, visit their website (http://www.arib-voyages.com), give them a call (00 212 (0) 6 73 18 12 72) and GOOOOOOOOO!!!!"

Dear folks, have experienced amazing Morocco having a tour of my dreams that was made possible by Arib-voyages professional and nice tourguides. www.arib-voyages.com arranges trips all over the country, but think their speciality is the Desert tours. We started our trip in Marrakech, over the beautiful Atlas mountains, Ouarzazate, the green and lush Draa Valley and then at the end of the road M\u00b4hamid and the amazing Desert with dunes like Erg Chigaga (350m high). Climbing high up on the top to see the sunset and felt the peace of mind in total quietness. Staying in the most beutiful Riads, Kasbahs and Camps. Travelling in a 4x4 Jeep, camel and motorbike. Eating the most tasty food while listening to the stories of El Ammari brothers telling about their culture, people and country in a most interesting way. They really try to fullfill all your wishes and more, to make your holiday in their country the most memorable one. In the desert we met a 74 years old nomad man who never had visited a city in his entire life. We were offered camelmilk and dates by a man having camels there. Saw adorable 10 days old camelbabies. The experience was like 1001 nights, a fairytail. An adventure we can warmly recommend you to do on your next holiday! Arib-voyages tailormades your tour according to your wishes and offers good value for your money."

I'm just back (today) from one of the most unforgettable trips to the desert! Run by the El Ammari brothers (I'm not sure of spelling!), this tour was different from what I expected, it was a genuine experience run by genuine people who were passionate about their country. We spent 2 days in Marrakech then were collected from our Riad and brought on a tour of Ourzazate and the incredible Sahara desert on 4X4 and camels. We learned about berber and bedouin culture from true natives who were proud of their heritage and that is quite a rarity on tours these days (I know from experience!). Highly recommend them- and the price was great! www.arib-voyages.com"
