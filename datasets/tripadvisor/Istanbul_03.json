The submarine experience- you need to buy an additional ticket from the desk. 2. Historical tram trip on the coast of golden horn- you need to get a voucher from the desk- free of charge. Both submarine and tram are scheduled tours so you need to check the hours so you experience both of them. 3. Dc-3 airplane that you can visit interior as well. 4.Cars like ford t, trabi,etc. 5. The original telegram patented by Edison. On top of everything, you have the option of parking free of charge."

Lale is a homey non-tourist place that has a cafeteria style selection so pointing and getting is easy. quit reasonable and very good food. When we told the waiter we were too full to have dessert, he came back with a crumb cake and ice cream dessert gratis. Nice."

I only heard about this place via a guide book and since I was at a loose end over a weekend on one of my many business trips to Istanbul I thought I would give it a go. My, how I was surprised. First of all I was amazed now inexpensive it was @ 15TL, the submarine was an additional 7TLSecond it is big covering a large area of ground on two sides of a road, some indoors and some outside.Third it has many sections, if you are not interested in one subject just move on to the next. If you are interested in anything mechanical there is bound to be an area to impress you.I spent about 5 absorbing hours looking at the extensive exhibitions of transportation, cars, motorcycles, farm machinery, model trains, horse carriages, boats, planes, toys, engines, reconstructed shops, models, model ships, the list goes on.I would say most items are from the 19th to 21st century and collected by the museum's namesake for their mechanical and historical significance.  The submarine trip was Ok but only in Turkish. I was given an English schematic and the official at the back of the tour did try his best to explain what things were, fortunately I have been round many WW2 subs and knew what to expect and roughly what I was looking at. At the price of less than a cup of coffee in the UK it was worth it.The place is good for children as well, having both a purpose built area exploring mathematical principles with colourful hands on experiments, and a number of interactive displays around the place. Even a small, realistic ships bridge with real controls where you could play with all the levers, wheels and buttons but that was tucked away in an area of masses of models of past ships which is a shame since that is probably not a section you would think of going with children. Signage is good in Turkish and English throughout.There is a snack bar on an old ferry , the food is homemeade, quite reasonable quality and dirt cheap at 4TL (= 1 GBP) for a baguette and some tea. The narrow guage railway trip wasnt really worth the effort , since it only went a few hundred yard in a park area beside the golden horn and back but it was free, so no compaints. The location was not easy to get to. Most people appeared to be locals who arrived by car. I actually walked the 5 miles each way from my Taksim hotel but not an easy walk. I presume taxis are are an option but I didnt see any nearby when I returned. If I could read Turkish there may be public transport options I missed.A really fascinating day out and glad I didnt miss it."

It is excellent, based on one man's personal collection it still has that snse of personal involvment you often don't get in large state or municipal collections. The stuff that's there is there because it fascinated Mr Koc, his spirit is in the collection. Must-see? the beautifully restored Fiat railcar. Don't forget there's another building across the road with a wonderful collection of ship, loco and plane models as well as an excellent recreation of a ship's bridge. Do allow yourself at least three hours for both sites, they are well worth it."

This museum is over a huge area and some parts are outdoors. It is dedicated to the history of transport , industry and communication and there is something for everybody. The displays are beautifully done and you will find items from miniatures to full sized boats and planes. There is various places to stop for something to eat or drink in different price ranges. I think for children this will be an exciting place to visit as they can partake in much of the exhibits. From Eminonu take bus 47, 47E or 47N and get off at the Kirmizi Minare stop or Ferry from Besiktas or the Big Bus Blue Route sightseeing tour. I can highly recommend this museum."

There are also carriages, boats, airplanes and even a submarine. This is a world war II submarine used then by the Turkish navy. I dont recommend a visit to this to very tall persons or people who suffer from cleistophobia. The visitors can take photos in all exhibits of the museum, but not in the submarine.

Great trip for families or anyone interested in pretty much anything.You can literally spend hours there without getting bored, and the admission charge is very reasonableGive yourself a whole day and include riding the ferry on up the Halic (also known as the Golden Horn) to Eyup, a fascinating place with an historic mosque and loads of restaurants.

Very interactive (you can enter inside trains, planes, boats and the submarine) and full of stuff to see! Also contains real size replicas of living history shops (pharmacy, toy store, ship chandler, watchmaker, blacksmith, cobbler, chemist), a sawmill and an olive oil factory. Way better than the marine museum and the Islamic science and technology. Must see in Istanbul! Also a kids heaven! (hundreds of toys, cars, ships, train and plane models). Entrance is 14 TL + 6TL for the (real) submarine. Planetarium is 2TL but is only about Saturn exploration and in Turkish."

Warning: if entering the submarine bear in mind that the tour is in Turkish. At some point they are going to set off the (crazy loud!) dive alarm and you may get a heart attack! Beware if you are claustrophobic. Don't forget the second building across the street. Take the ferry up the golden horn"

For a small extra charge, you can join a tour of the submarine located in the water just outside the museum.

Having a transport mad husband I have been to numerous museums all over the place and visiting another on a very hot day was not one I was thrilled about. How wrong could I have been, this museum was absolutely fantastic, beautifully looked after and had something for everyone - even the Doll's House museum - see if you can spot the labrador in a kennel!! The vast collection includes planes, trains, bikes, motorcycles, fantastic cars - including one to delight Harry Potter fans, engines of all kinds, steam engines, boats, and a WW2 American submarine that saw action in the Pacific and later sold to Turkish Navy. Take my hat off to those brave men who served in her - it was an unforgettable experience. Nice little gift shop, smiling and helpful staff, plenty of loos and a nice cafe. If you want a nice lunch there is also a waterfront restaurant (not part of museum) that was lovely. Take a little ferry from the harbour - not where the bigger boats are, walk further on, under the underpass and go past the bus terminal to a small ferry (your Istanbul travel pass works) and get off at the 2nd stop. Ferrries are on the hour. This was in the end a lovely day and well worth it!"

The name of this museum kept popping up whenever I searched for things to do with children in Istanbul and our visit there made it clear why. It is an absolute gem of a museum that will delight and fascinate children and adults alike. Its essentially a transport museum with a little bit of history of Kemal Ataturk thrown in as well. But the Transportation Museum is beyond amazing with something for everyone. With an immense collection of all types of transports that include vintage cars and two wheelers, boats, small ships, trains, trams, planes and to top it all an actual submarine, this place is a veritable treasure house. My kids and I must say me and my husband loved every minute that we spent there. I would suggest you go have a look even if not travelling with kids as its a wonderful experience for adults as well.Getting there is easy by taxi or bus (starting from Eminonu with the bus stop right at the gate of the museum). But do make it a part of your Istanbul itinerary, you won't regret it!"

We did - and I'm so glad we made the effort!It's easy to get to by ferry from Eminonu: jump off at Haskoy and it's just a couple of minutes walk round the corner. There's a 12tl fee to get in to the museum - but we spent 3 hours there and didn't get to see half of the exhibits, so it is a full day out and well worth the money.The museum is so much more than just historical and educational. We started with the Rahmi M Koc and the Ataturk rooms, which were absolutely full of memorabilia. So many pieces from so many amazing places and events - it makes you wonder where Mrs Koc kept them all before the museum was built! Then there's a special exhibition room: when we went there were beautiful dolls houses on display. There are rooms and rooms of cars, boats, trains, steam vehicles, engines, planes, bikes, motorbikes, dolls prams, horse drawn carriages... There are model shops, a model sawmill, and a model olive oil factory. There's a display of toys old and new. There are machines that work when you press a button. There are interactive displays. There are trams and cars, ferries and planes you can climb into. There are videos, hands-on activities, things to touch and things to play with.Each and every exhibit is in stunning condition, with a story or an explanation or a piece of history for you to read. There is a map that will guide you round (though we thoroughly enjoyed wandering). We met groups of school children, groups of teenagers, adults, inquisitive toddlers... every age group seemed to find something that fascinated them. There are a number of food & drink areas, with a range of styles and a range of prices.There is, across the road, a second site with what looked like a gorgeous caf\u00e9. We just didn't have any time to go and explore it. We didn't have time to do a guided tour of the submarine either (you need to buy a separate ticket for this). Which means we have a great excuse for going back another time!"

Very informative first section on Kemal Ataturk with interesting newspaper clippings from the 1920s, Time Magazine covers, and some of his clothing and other personal items. Some great photos, too. Then, on a different note, there are rooms of the most magnificently restored cars. There are areas with old tramway cars and buses, rooms full of seagoing vessels and associated paraphernalia ... We spent three hours here, but that wasn't nearly enough time, and if we are lucky enough to return to Istanbul, we will come back here to finish our visit. Oh, and we had a lovely lunch here at the restaurant overlooking the water. Pricy, but great food. Almost forgot to mention two special exhibitions on currently, one of dolls houses, the other a photographic exhibition of veterans from Turkey and Aus. and NZ, of the Gallipoli campaign. Very moving."

We got the ferry there and back - there is one an hour and we were lucky with timing.Well worth a few hours of your day. You get the boat down from the main ferry terminal and past the bus station. They're often a bit late which can work to your advantage. A cab to the museum shouldn't be too much either but the boat is a great way to travel. "

There isn't much promotion of the display... it's a little off the tourist beaten track. A 2TL/10 min ferry ride from the south side of the Golden Horn and a 200 metre walk from the ferry got us to the front door. There are many early transport and other generational displays to interest the whole family. Amongst many other catergories, on display...... horse and carriage through to the evolution of the motor vehicle,,,,,,motor bikes from the early 1900's onwards.....sizeable doll houses...... memorabilia from Turkish and Australian armies (WW1).......trams..... planes....and so on. A bit of a gem if you are looking for comparisons between generations."

We LOVED this museum as much as our 10 and 8 year old BUT we found ourselves taking photo after photo for other adults at home that we wanted to share this experience with as we know they would have loved it too. From cross-sections of household appliances \"I always wondered what happens in a dishwasher\" Miss H said, olden day cars of all shapes and sizes, and boats and trains and planes. Planes to go inside of too. Private jet \"oooohhh, this would be cool\" and another \"ooooohh this is like the plane from the Madagascar movie\". The remnants of a fighter plane from wartime and all the history to go with all these things if we so desired to stand and read. Then there was the display of dollhouses and miniature scenes from Turkey. If you love attention to detail. The intricacy in these displays is worth a visit alone. There were the life size models of blacksmith stores and old shops.And then there was the submarine. It was an additional cost to do this and even though the guide only spoke Turkish. It was still worth.We paid 25TL each way by taxi from the Sultanahmet to Rahmi M. Koc and we're very glad we did. We would definitely visit again."

You will find broad collections of automobiles, steam engines, trains/cars and boats. There is even a diesel submarine (extra cost with designated tour time). Also included is an excellent diorama section (not really the \"doll houses\" written on the sign), an old wood working shop, some airplanes, and some full-scale replicas of different sorts of shops common at the beginning of the industrial revolution. A ferry from the Emin\u00f6n\u00fc terminal (north of the others past the big bus terminal) has a stop adjacent to the museum.While I especially recommend this museum if you are touring with school-age children it is also very interesting for adults. A fair number of interactive exhibits are included. I especially enjoyed walking through a wonderfully restored Italian train car (a powered one-car passenger train) from the 1930s."

We walked here from the Galata Tower (not a fun walk, take a taxi or the water taxi/ferry, get off on the Eminonu stop on the light rail, walk past the Galata Bridge to the ferries).The museum is really quite nice, tons of classic/interesting cars, boats, miniature houses, airplanes, train cars and industrial equipment (ever seen a steamroller from the 1910s? You will here). It is a very well kept museum, and they have a nice little cafe adjacent to the main car show room. The submarine tour was great as well, so I recommend spending a couple of bucks to get that add-on. Just an FYI, the train ride is essentially an activity for small kids, as the train goes back and forth on a little track, fine, but as an adult you aren't missing much. If you are tight for time in Istanbul, yeah, you might not see this, but my wife and I really enjoyed it, worth the trip over, really neat way to spend 2-3 hours, so I would highly recommend the museum."

Old cars, motorcycles, engines, how computers work, submarines, trains, planes and many other items of interest presented in a very neat way and pedagogical. We have been at museums like London's Science museum. The Rahmi Koc matches this museum. Not necessarily along the same lines of content, but at least through its quality. This is a very complete collection of vehicles of various sorts.At the top shelf was the visit in the submarine. Here you met volunteers, which previously served in the turkish navy. The officer who guided us were a former machine engineer in the submarine, and could tell us lots of details.There is an entrance fee, but it is nevertheless cheap."

I and my son have visited this place several times and it has been never boring. It will be a great experience for you and your kids. You can easily spend the whole day in the museum. Even if you are short in time, you should consider spending at least your whole afternoon. For quick and inexpensive lunch, you can grab something from the sandwich bar in the ship parked on the Golden Horn (there is a small souvenir shop near the sandwich bar selling toys and a few inexpensive items that you and your kids may enjoy) or enjoy an upscale lunch/dinner (excellent food, but expensive) at the restaurant looking at the Golden Horn.

There you can plenty of vehicles, divided in separate halls, such as automobiles, motorcycles, locomotives and wagons, airplanes, helicopters, a tank and a real submarine - all dating from a wide period of time.There is a hall with the main domestic appliances, given in a transparent cross section, showing how they work when you press the START button. Other sections exhibit various equipment, such as communications, measuring, scientific devices, etc. There are explanations both in Turkish and English. There is a number of cafes with reasonable prices in the area.The tour in the submarine is very interesting and you will be given a diploma at the end. By the way - children below 8 years of age are not allowed due to safety reasons, and you will have to pay extra fee for the submarine. The easiest way to get there is to take the bus 47, 47E, 47C form Eminonu bus station, close to the ferries and to hop off at K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131 Minare Dura\u011f\u0131 bus stop. I can say it from personal experience, as the first time I visited the museum, I took a taxi but the driver got lost while searching for it.I highly recommend that you visit the museum, especially the kids will have a lot of fun."

            "review": "Fun for teenage boys of all ages and both genders. This museum is not a transport museum, it's not a technology museum and it's not a science museum. Neither is it a comprehensive display of historically-important artefacts. It is, broadly speaking, the gigantic private collection of a rich individual who liked cool techie stuff. Thus, you will see steam engines of all types - most of them with buttons to make the pistons go up and down. You will see a large collection of classic cars, e.g. The Model 'T' Ford, Cadillacs, Jaguars. You will see Harley Davidson motorbikes, a large collection of old Apple computers, and countless diving helmets. There is movie-making equipment, a semi-working olive oil factory, a huge collection of speed boats (and a dugout canoe), countless steam trains, tanks, light aircraft... And even (drum roll) a US submarine that you can tour around, which is moored in the Golden Horn (you have to pay extra).If that description makes you go 'ooh, cool!', you are the target audience of this museum... We went on Boxing Day (26 Dec) when the place was almost empty except for a wedding reception, and we were the only two people touring the submarine in the last spot of the day. We toured with a former Turkish submarine engineer of twenty-five years standing who could speak enough English to make it interesting. All the exhibits are in English and Turkish.We had lunch in the Cafe au Levant, which is a perfectly nice French bistro on the site. There is also a coffee shop and a sit-down restaurant (or possibly two sit-down restaurants). The only downer was getting to/from the museum without private transport (as a British tourist). We walked, having been to Chora in the morning. The route back to Galata Bridge/Sultanahmet was through an industrial estate with poor pavements in the rain."

The wide ranging exhibits are impeccably maintained. There are many places to comfortably sit and enjoy the surroundings, as well as a couple of places for coffee and snacks. And there is a beautiful restaurant. The only short coming is that is not easy to get to unless you're adventuresome and don't mind finding your way on busses and the metro. Do not take a taxi in Istanbul. You WILL be cheated. I had read the many warnings posted in Trip Advisor and I ignored that advice and was cheated out of over 50tl - and had a trip ruining screaming match at the side of the road with the driver. Forget filing a complaint with the police. Each of three police stations referred us to another one, so we gave up."

An Individual collector's collection(amazing, that!) of cars, trains, boats, planes, bikes, gadgets, and submarine(!) all beautifully and aesthetically presented. My 3 yr old absolutely loved the interactive, transparent household appliances (dishwasher, washing machine, vacuum cleaner, etc) that showed her the inner workings of everyday gadgets. The display of the workings of car engines, bikes and cycles were also superb. Do note that the planetarium is only open on weekends(so we missed it), and that the submarine tour, though interesting, was entirely in Turkish. We did get a leaflet explaining the submarine's main features in English, but as the tour was given in the reverse order to the directions, by the time we sorted things, we'd missed quite a bit. But was a lovely experience overall, and we spent three and a half hours there and were'nt done! If you are automobile, or science buffs, plan to spend a while!"

            "review": "A surprisingly well-designed and enjoyable museum in Istanbul. The Rahmi M. Koc Museum carries the name of its benefactor, the (former) chairman of the board for one of the largest conglomerates in Turkey, the Koc Holdings. It is hard to categorize this museum - it is not really a science museum, it is not a history museum, it is not a transportation museum, it is not a technology museum, it is not a toy museum, but rather it is a bit of everything. Perhaps it is a museum that tells the story of industrialization in Istanbul starting from the latter years of the Ottoman Empire (mid 1880s) to today's modern Turkey. The above description may imply that the museum has a mishmash of items, and that may turn off a potential visitor. It should not! You may think that you have little or no interest in such a museum. You should not!The museum is surprisingly well-designed and enjoyable. Everything is described both in Turkish and English. The museum has a large collection of antique cars, boats, train cars / locomotives and planes as well as a large ferry and a full size submarine. Also included in the museum grounds are an impressive collection of model ships, telecommunications equipment, toys, measurement equipment and standards, all displayed in a series of buildings and courtyards along the Golden Horn.If you are visiting with kids, this is a particularly good choice, as kids will find tons of things to do. In addition to those collections listed above, there are math and science games for kids, as well as a planetarium that shows a variety of shows.If located in any other city, this would have been a five star attraction. Perhaps the only reason why I am giving this a four star is because Istanbul has so many five star attractions that this one just quite does rise to the level of those (such as Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, Rustem Pasa Mosque, Suleymaniye Mosque, Chora Museum, Bosporus Tour, Underground Cistern, Topkapi Palace, Istanbul Museum of Archeology, view from Camlica Hill, etc.) But if you have done all of those, and/or you have kids (including teens), you will enjoy this museum. Set aside at least 3 hours to visit. The museum has a nice restaurant and a cafe (inside the refurbished ferry), and the prices are very very reasonable.Finally, while the setting for this museum (along the Golden Horn) is spectacular, getting there is a bit of a challenge. Easiest way: Get to Karakoy (or Eminonu) and then take a taxi. It should only be about 12-15 Liras ($6-8 as of November 2014)."

At the time of our visit a new gallery was being arranged for model houses exhibition. This visit ended up being a fascinating range of industrial experiences from moving between submarine chambers by squeezing through the hatches between them to viewing the inside of a dishwasher while it is being operated! My little boy was mesmerised by many of the exhibits and loved the hands-on mathematics section where there were about a dozen interactive stations.Regardless of which city in the world this museum is located in, it would be a great shame to leave it out of one\u2019s travel itinerary but in a city renowned for its palaces, hamams, mosques and bazaars, visiting it would add a pleasantly surprising variety to your time.

Still, I trusted the reviews and went along and was very glad I did, as were the rest of my family, ranging from 6 to 70.While Sultanahmet should, of course, be your first priority in Istanbul, I would put this a strong second. Funded by one of Turkey's wealthiest families this museum has clearly been assembled out of love rather than any drive to make money. There is a truly fantastic, and fascinating, collection of classic cars, ships, trains and planes that have to be seen to be believed. In addition, hands on mathematics section that (even) kids will love and a planetarium (at extra cost). The crowning glory is the opportunity to tour an ex-military, 100 metre submarine (an inexpensive extra), floating in the Golden Horn - something truly unique.I guess I should mention that food and refreshment is available on site and you do not need a good weather day to make the most of this.In summary, I really can't recommend this enough.

Unfortunately, its position is hard to reach by foot.. and the public transport is limited. I reached the Rahmi Koc Museum using the Big Bus Tour, blue line.. However, it deserves being visited despite the effort the reach it. I liked very much the fact that the museum is very interactive.. and also the exbition quite mix international history of transport with the Turkish history of transport.."

This is an outstanding collection of one man's Transportation Fascination. Set in a restored warehouse on the Golden Horn waterway, this is a great place to visit and learn and get a bit outside of busy Istanbul."

            "review": "Literally a travel machine!. I call Rahmi M. Koc Museum a time machine traveler! The place steps you back in time and future! Pity we only discovered it towards the end of our trip. After our visit to Istanbul's \"must seen sights\" we needed to see that \"extra\" thing...and Rahmi Museum was beyond than a good choice.We were a bit worried whether our young daughter (3 years and half) would be entertained but to my surpise she's still asking for the retro red car and the nostalgic train ride!We reached the place via a taxi (costed us 25TL from Blue Mosque) and returned back via public bus ( using our IstanbulKart). We decided to visit the museum during the harsh hours of day , so wondering around with public transportation on a hot day with a baby trolley was not a goood idea. Thus we picked taxi and chose to return back via bus (which to my surprise was very easy handling it with a baby's trolley!!! Bus stop is excatly outside of the entrance. Last stop of it at Eminonu).Two thumps up to ithe museum managment and personel for the effort to discover and maintain so well soooo many exhibits ! I really enjoyed the section with the trains. Literally last thing I was expecting was me sitting and \"feeling\" the vintage aura of an italian retro 1st class wagon!! Fenerbache Boat and the submarine tour is a must! While entrance is not allowed for toddlers at the Submarine (kids under 8 years old are not allowed), I really enjoyed the exhibition hosted on the boat of vintage toys. I was thrilled to see some old toys that used to be my fav passtime play! Treat yourself with a hot cupt of tea after ther submarine tour and do take it on the boat's deck even if it's a bit humid and hot. The view of the Golden Horn and the seaguls' sounds will defenitely pay you off!Museum has a vast exhibits. Steam cars, retro firecars, shiny boats, penny farthing type bycicles jump into your eyes all over !!The place is enormous, be prepared to spend half day if you want to see all exhibits. I have to admit that we've skipped a couple of them due to to time pressure! If you understand turkish language do go to the planetarium (unfortunately the videos there, are in turkish).If you feel tired take advantage of the small coffe shops in the museum: treat yourself with a typical glass of tea or coffee either on the Fenerbache Boat, or at the cute and cozy coffee shop at the entrance of the antique automobiles or enjoy lunch outdoors at one of the restuarants of the museum.Highlights of the visit:a) Hask\u00f6y \u2013 S\u00fctl\u00fcce Railway( don't get the idea that you will go around the city with a retro wagon... :) but those 20 minitues ride in a retro wagon will give you the taste of how things worked back in time. So nostalgic!b) spend a few more minutes in the Living History section. Smell the essence of cinamon of the old pharmacy, observe the old guy trying to fix a clock, make or hear the sound of the shoe maker.... c) get on the Douglas DC-3 'Dakota'!!! Seat on the chairs and travel back in time!d) when visting the navigation department, go to the fishing types boats and at the end of the corridor you will come across an exhibit that pictures an old fisherman with a kid (articificial models) fixing their fishing nets while the radio is tuned to nice melodies. This images takes literally there!e) if you into science, definetly visit the collection of scientific devices as well as the section of Science and Technology Workshop. After the visit you 'll definetly know how on earth your home devices work (besides the basic : put the plug on and switch on the outlet! )f) if you have Museum Pass Card Advantage you will benefit %20 discount on the entrance and %10 discount in the shop. The gift shop has really gifts at good prices!Overall: I will definetly return back to catch up to all the exhibits I left behind and to have again my tea on the Fenerbache Ferry's deck! Worthed every single lira we paid for it!"

I was starting to think that maybe we were crazy for choosing this city...in this 90 + degree heat. But this is the one attraction where TripAdvisor did not lead me astray....we got here later in the afternoon late July and there wasn't a line for tickets, we took our time going through the rooms...and the whole family really loved it. There are trains and boats outside where it's still a little steamy, but there is a cafe to cool off and grab a Coke and it's right on the water.

Well, we were wrong. We went to this museum on the strength of TripAdvisor traveler recommendations. We allowed an hour for this attraction. Four hours into it, our legs gave out and we quit even though there was still much to see. This is probably one of the finest attractions we have ever seen anywhere on anything, a huge collection of perfectly restored old and antique cars, a huge boat and navigational artifacts, a remarkable collection of street cars starting with horse drawn trams, old train cars, the original steam powered cable car up to Galata hill from 1875, an excellent aviation collection, etc. You get the idea, if it moves they have it. All the exhibits are well described and documented in both English an Turkish. Must see to believe how well done this is.For a break you can stop for drinks and snacks at the adjacent Halat cafe/restaurant. A beautiful and elegant setting. We are coming back for dinner at this most incredible spot right on the Bosphorus with the historic Istanbul in the background. Best to take a taxi. Not easily accessible on foot without serious knowledge of public transportation."

Mr Koq has the money to indulge his interests and the restoration of the buildings and the items on display are all very tasteful and must have cost a small fortune. He should be very proud of this museum.You could easily spend an entire day here if you wanted but a few hours is probably enough for most. As the info booklet states, \"the first major museum in Turkey dedicated to the history of transportation, industry and communication\" and it certainly lives up to the description.As others have said, it has a bit of everything and it is all in beautiful condition. We paid the extra YTL7 for the submarine tour which runs at regular times. You get a certificate at the end of the tour!It is actually quite a fun and interesting place to visit and everything is in pristine condition with staff polishing and dusting the exhibits to keep them looking that way.Husband particularly enjoyed going inside the DC3, but we both enjoyed so many of the exhibits in this inside/outside museum it is much too difficult to describe them all.When you need to rest for a short time there are a couple of cafes where you can buy snacks and drinks, and restrooms in various buildings.It was quite busy when we were there as there were several school groups visiting.We took the ferry to the Haskoy dock. It docks next to some of the outdoor exhibits but you cannot enter from here. You need to walk straight ahead through the park, turn left at the road and walk 2 or 3 minutes to reach the entrance.If you want something completely different in Istanbul give this a try. After the museum, if you continue a few minutes further on the ferry from Haskoy to Eyup and take the cable car up for the fabulous views you will have enjoyed a great day out on the Golden Horn."

It's a fun place, essentially an oversize collection of planes, trains and automobiles, and the sub. The working train was booked out when we got there, so it's popular (and there is a tugboat ride, which looks great, for the summer). Great for kids, there's an interactive puzzle room, and lots to see. There were many brides when we visited, I don't know if there was a wedding show, or if it's simply popular for wedding photos. Take the Halic ferry from Eminou, 3rd stop I think, in Haskoy. When facing the water, the ferry leaves from the left side of the Galata bridge, across a car park, and a bit of a distance from the main Bosphorous ferry cruises. It leaves from right beside the TurYol pier (which does 1.5 hour Bosphorous cruises for 12 TL). Two hours will be plenty for most, unless you visit the sub or planetarium. Nice coffee shop (and restaurant in high season). Pretty park with kid's playground at ferry stop. Great place to calm down from the chaos of Istanbul."

Firstly, a warning - don't go here expecting to be in and out in a couple of hours as you really need a whole day to do it justice. The collections are almost extravagant in their breadth - a fabulous huge array of vintage cars, planes, boats, trains (model and life size), militaria, engines small to gigantic, Mr K\u00f6c's private collection, an Attaturk display ad infinitum and all splendidly displayed. Hordes of rather noisy schoolchildren were rather a distraction but they soon went and, after all, it is their country and history! Some nice caf\u00e9s and an excellent (more pricey) restaurant on the waterfront. Oh, and of course a submarine! Well worth a visit."

There's something there for everyone. We were there with about 200 schoolchildren who were very wild, but they didn't stay very long. (As a schoolteacher, I suggest when you take your classes on a field trip, you give them specific things to look for and study, not just run wild, touching the exhibits, and screaming.) Everything was perfectly maintained and there were explanations in English. There was so much to see. The olive press was very interesting, as well as the mobile x-ray machine on a truck. There were cars we'd never heard of, like Cinderella's Coffin. The deconstructed technology items were very interesting. There were so many boats, trains, and machines; it was just a great experience."

If it moves, he has one, or ten, and you will find one here. We found this place PURELY by accident. We didn't see a thing about it anywhere and had we not been looking for things to do locally (I broke my ankle the day we got to Istanbul so our four days in town turned into two weeks) we would never have found it. I dream about this museum. It's new, clean, huge, easily navigated, chock full of cool stuff and is absolutely devoid of crowds.

Once you have finished the obligatory visit to the marvels of Sultanahmet and its attractions, consider a visit to this wonderful museum. It has a huge assortment of vintage cars, buses, trains, trams and planes. The assortment of cars is the best I have ever seen. The model T-ford is on view with many other vintage cars and trucks. Vintage motor cycles, bicycles, prams, boats and just about aything industrial is on show. There is also an exhibition relating to Ataturk which is worth a look. For a little extra you can visit the inside of a de-commissioned WW2 American submarine which was ultimately a part of the Turkish navy. Kids will love it. A handy hint - It is easy to spend a day there with time passing quickly. For a linch break, don't eat at the museum. Keep your museum ticket and visit the nearby Lale Lokantasi cafe/restaurant. As you exit the museum turn right and walk 20 or 30 metres. Lok to your left and there is a small street. You should be able to see the restaurant. It is clean, cheap and serves Turkish food at a very reaonable price. Once finished, go back to the museum and show your ticket, and you can re-enter. It is easy to get to. Either a bus (47E) from Eminonu or a ferry from Eminonu. For variety, go back by bus if you arrived there by ferry at first. Both take the Istanbulcarte. Enjoy this not well publicised attraction. There is no other like it."

The concept behind it is crazy, but it works. Approaching the waterside area where it exists, the first thing you notice is the array of airplanes around the main entrance. By the water you will find a collection of interesting boats, and sheds in the courtyard display ancient steam engines, tramcars, and other railway artefacts ----- including the Sultan's personal carriage containing a dummy of the great man himself. Most of our time was, however, spent in the Langerhane building, because of the inclement weather at the time. The collection of automobiles ranging between 1930 and 1970 was fascinating, and included the 1960 Ford Anglia, the first car I ever owned. Many had their insides exposed, or reflected into view by mirrors under the floor. Explanations in Turkish and English were well done. Then there were the 2-wheel modes of transportation: bicycles, mopeds, scooters and fully-fledged motor bikes. Again, the guts and mode of operation were revealed, and they could be started at the press of a button. This theme was continued with common household appliances such as clothes washers and dryers, dish washers and many others: push a button and they start; by encasing them in transparent plastic, the moving parts were in full view during operation. As one last of many other possible examples, I will mention electronics. This series of exhibits included computers, TV and Radio equipment, CD players and Video recorders where removal of the casing revealed the secrets of how they did what you paid for them to do. Add in very clean washrooms and cafeteria facilities and you have the basis for a very enjoyable and informative half-day. But of course, it has nothing whatever to do with Turkey as such."

In the event, I spent four happy hours wandering the vast collection and marvelling at what can be done with a museum to capture the interest.Room after room of attractively arranged vehicles were interspersed with points of interest such as a 3D cinema, planes who's cockpit you could visit, a No.52 routemaster bus from Mill Hill to Hyde Park Corner (looking very out of place!), working machinery, trams you could walk through, videos and much more. A series of boats were moored at the side of the museum, including a WW2 American submarine, of which I was thrilled to take a brief tour.I can enthusiastically recommend this museum to any visitor.

With its open air museum part, you never feel how the time spent at this museum : there are so many things to see around; an old submarine-into which you may have a small tour, an old train trail-on which you can still travel for 5-10 minutes, an old Bosphorus ship-onboard you can have some tea and traditional Turkish simit, fishing boat-you can have a tour of Golden Horn, and so many more interesting machinery... old cars, planes, printing machines, a planetarium... This is the place for everyone : children, old and young people, students, teachers, families, parents...All can enjoy and have great time there. At the end of the day, there are many choices to rest at : cafe, restaurant, bar either on mainland or onboard of a ship."

I couldn't wait to go to this one in Istanbul!We decided that we should go after the chora church, as the pier was right next to the museum. Walking from chora church from the pier took a long time as we just got a bit lost in the old streets of Fatih. And also, we walked past one of the pier stations by mistake, as the ferry stations look just like small disused huts! We overshot by two ferry stops but hey, it was a good walk. We arrived in Haskoy ferry station and the museum is right next to it! This museum has everything- such an interesting museum, I think it will be amazing for kids. It has cars, trains, mills, carriages, bicycles, ships, any other mechanically working objects! So nicely curated, also quiet as not many people were there at that time! They also have nice few restaurants on site, a nice posh quiet one looking over to the sea was tempting. It is slightly difficult to get to if you are staying in other places, but I definitely recommend this place to visit. ( Suppose from eminou, it will be direct ferry transfer.) You get 20% off if you have istanbul museum card."

Still, there is a lot here for almost everyone - cars, trains, household items, boats, aircraft, and more - all combined with a unique look at how Turkey has progressed into the modern era over the past 100 years. Many of the exhibits allow you to actually climb into or aboard them, and all let you get far closer and touch more things than you would in a more well-known museum. There were very few people there when we went, so it was a relaxing break from an otherwise busy day.Getting there is a longish but fairly cheap taxi ride from the Eminonu tram stop. I'm not aware of a better public transit option, but the cab driver knew right where it was and dropped us right near the front entrance.If you go, I recommend taking a break midway through, getting a snack (very inexpensive) aboard the museum's restored ferry and sitting at the tables on the front deck while watching the boats on the Golden Horn."

The most interesting museum I have ever been in Turkey, This is the only place you can see a reel and used submarine, so many old industrial items, very well organised staff, located in the Naval docks area. We saw a wonderfull Coca Cola fast food buffet, however, they dont know how to serve Hot Dog, I am not joking, a regular Hot Dog !!! They use a standary bread (pressed in toaster), it is a big shame to do that in a such wonderfull museum and a curse to that wonderfully designed Coca Cola buffet."

Once you are inside the main building, you need to pay the entrance fee. Grab hold of the map of the museum. Every part of the building, they have different sections dedicated to the transportation vehicles like vintage cars,motorbikes, boats , trains and horse carriages. I love the trains section, they were just beautiful. Outside on the courtyard, there is an used airplane perched on the roof, you can climb up and get to see inside the cockpit. There is also the 1st steamer which has stopped it's operation, decked near to the submarine.Inside the steamer, there are pictures of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. If you want to explore the submarine, you need to get your bookings earlier..it comes with a guided tour. I truly enjoyed visiting this museum with my kids and for sure that we will come back again for another exploration...:))"

There is a section that shows the inner workings of some machines- like a vacuum , motorbike- nice for kids who are interested in that kind of thing. My girls liked seeing old dollhouses and the furniture. We spent about 2 hours here, but could have spent more. If you have done all the tourist attractions in Istanbul and have extra time, bring your kids here. I noticed that they do a lot of school programs here and there were plenty of local kids enjoying the museum. There is a planetarium that only opens on weekends."

The Naval Museum is dour, although it is in the midst of a renovation that may change that situation. The Koc Museum, however, is execellent -- a vast collection of cars, trains, planes, ships and small craft, and marine art and artifacts house in a renovated anchor foundry on the Golden Horn. It is a bit out of the way, but easily reached by the regular Golden Horn ferry. Every object or environment in the museum has been perfectly restored. The labels, in Turkish and English, are excellent. The museum restaurant is a perfect place for lunch, quiet, very good food, and right on the water. Recommended for transportation and marine enthusiasts without hesitation."

This is a museum with a BIG difference, as it represents a quite unique collection of objects, both mechanical and familiar, mixed in with art and memorabilia, all put together by one of Turkey's wealthiest Industrialists, on a scale quite beyond what ordinary mortals might imagine. Apart from the cars and the submarine, there is a superb selection of horse-drawn carriages, together with prams and children's objects. There is also a very detailed set of booths detailing many and varied facets of the Owner's sailing trip around the world.You should note this is the private collection of no ordinary citizen, but of the man who welcomed Prince Charles and Diana, the Princess of Wales, to Turkey, after their wedding. The collection includes many fascinating memorabilia, gathered from encounters with visiting Heads of State.Be sure to take a superb lunch, in the sunshine, at one of the two restaurants serving good food & wine by the side of the Golden Horn. Suitable for parents, perhaps whilst their children race radio-controled model tugboats, or go for a rowing boat ride! Visited in June 2010."

This museum certainly wowed me with their fantastic collection of boats, trains, and early transportation vehicles to modern day automobiles. They had the little car that was in a Harry Potter film!. I loved the small wooden boats including one that came from Italy, with turquoise colored leather seats. They also had real locomotives and Trams. Especially fun was to walk along \"The Living History Shops\", Among them Ship Chandler where you could peek into the windows and see the various instruments that sailors used. Right next store was the watchmaker shop, filled with all sorts, of brass clocks and watches, and a mannequin so real looking that I almost started to ask him questions. The boat maker shop was filled with ropes, small motors, and various tools used to repair boats.After, I took a break to go outside and climbed up into a real DC3 airplane, DC-3. You can walk right up to see the cockpit and the instrument panel. I made a picture using my mechanical Nikon f2 in black & white film. It seemed so small compared to today's big jets, the museum worker gestured for me to sit down in one of the seats. He pressed a control switch and I could hear a recording of a live take off and landing and listen to the pilot talking to the control tower. This was a lot of fun, after there was more info on the DC3 . They said that they have a few of these planes now working in Australian for short trips. Docked along the Golden Horn you can see various fishing boats, tug boats and even a Submarine (sorry I did not go inside) There is also a lovely wooden ferry boat, where you can have tea, or coffee and sit in the original leather and wood chairs inside.Across the street, they have maritime models, and printing machines. The museum was almost closing so I had to rush thru this part unfortunately.Being a great fan of mechanical devices and machinery it was a great experience. I was sorry that I could not ride on their narrow train that goes along the Golden Horn it runs only on the weekends I was told. If you like mechanical things you will certainly love spending a day inside and outside this museum. They do have a lovely gift shop that has model cars, and airplanes. A pub, a restaurant and the cafe on the ferry boat. I think both kids and adults will have a great time."

We planned our holiday in Turkey but were concerned that there were no obvious places the kids (two boys) would really enjoy (not too interested in mosques) so it was a relief to read about the Rahmi Koc Museum. It was definitely not a let down - the museum is awesome, not just for kids, the amount of exhibits on display is incredible and you can easily spend the whole day and not see everything. The exhibits include an actual post WWII submarine which is worth the trip by itself but also cut-out engines, appliances, vintage cars and airplanes for the mechanically minded and exquisite models for the more aesthetically inclined. Perhaps the only down side was that some exhibits, like the tug boat were closed presumably for the season, a big advantage was the very reasonably priced items in the various charming kiosks around the museum - our favorite was the one on the ferry boat moored by the museum and exhibit in itself. If you're staying in the Old City or close by, an interesting way to get to the museum is by the ferry that leaves from close to the Galata Bridge - its a great boat ride and absolutely charming."

We were blown away by the scope and depth of the collection. There are several places to eat on site and also a tea parlor (if you're there as long as we were, you'll need to refuel). We could have stayed longer, but they were closing."

We took a boat to Rahmi Koc so my husband could see the B24 bomber, which was beautifully displayed with the touching story of its resurrection from the sea. We were charmed by the variety of machinery and the obvious love Koc has for the Industrial Age and ended up appreciating the loving care with which the objects were displayed.The museum was uncrowded and finding the Levant Restaurant, where we sat on the patio overlooking the water and had a splended meal [pastas with seafood] which watching the boats was a unexpected extra."

            "review": "An interesting diversion. The museum sits on the bank of the Hali\u00e7 (Golden Horn) and is easily accessible by public transport, being only 10 minutes from Taksim and also from Eminonu. We visited during a public holiday and were pleased to find it pleasantly quiet. The Golden Horn has undergone a transformation over the last few years and is now a sadly overlooked part of the city that visitors really should get to.The grounds and buildings are pristine, beautifully decorated and maintained as are other Ko\u00e7 buildings for the public. The museum focuses on transport and technology and has a good selection of vintage cars as well as sections devoted to industrial processes and maritime, printing, the cinema etc. Nearly all the information is in both Turkish and in English and there are staff who can help.The restaurant cafe (Halat) on the water's edge has super views of Balat and the mosques and has a good choice of meals as well as sandwiches at average prices. It is licensed and stays open until 10 at night so would be a perfect place to enjoy an Istanbul sunset.There are daily boat trips along the Golden Horn, either by an old Black sea fishing boat or by a cute tugboat. Cruises leave at 10 and 5 weekdays and 10 and 8 p.m. weekends. You can also visit a submarine and the planetarium for a small extra fee. We really enjoyed the museum and the lovely atmosphere and wished we had visited a long time ago. It is well worth the 12.50TL admission.Closed on Mondays.Rahmi M.

We went to the Rahmi Koc museum as part of a 21 day tour of eastern Europe, the four hours we spent at the museum was the highlight of the whole tour for our four year old. The only disappointment was that he was not allowed on the submarine (over eights only for some reason) but they had a mock up of the control room outside which he just loved. A really well presented meseum with LOADS of buttons for your litten to press. A sure hit for any young family."

You can see as original antiques from Ottoman times (there is a real plane, tank, a copy of an olive-oil manufactory), also some turkish people donated their collections of porcelain figures, model cars...till examples of European culture, like UK and US REAL cars :) I took photos from my visit there, I can share!"

            "review": "Extremely well done museum for both kids and adults. I agree with aeronuat, this museum deserves more attention. I was looking for a place that would be enjoyable for my four year old son, but in the end I don't know who liked it more, him or me. I found myself wishing that they had something like this in my hometown, I would go all the time. The exhibits were well-presented, educational, and interesting, not dry and boring like I expected a museum like this to be. I learned quite a bit about mechanics while my son enjoyed exploring the various types of transportation and seeing how things worked (we especially liked the room that showed an olive factory). For children (or adults) who are enthralled with model trains, be aware that across the street is another part of the museum that has (among a lot of other exhibits) two model train layouts on the basement floor, my son could have spent all his time there. If you're not in the Taksim area, I might suggest taking a taxi for convenience, it was about 14 TL from the Galata Tower and took about 15-20 minutes. It was an easy bus ride back to the Eminonu area."

I hope the Hopon hopoff bus one day chooses to make their route pass Miniaturk and Rahmi M Koc museums.Both places are worth seeing indeed.Word on Taxidrivers in Istanbul: Avoid the taxis- their only goal is to rip you off- and even with their meters they will cheat you anyway. First of all, when trying to arrange the price for a tour, they will tell you that it is on meter- just keep a good eye on the meter while driving- they can make the price go up by pushing the buttons. WARNING: A classic is to change the 50TRY bill into a 5TRY bill and make you think you gave them the wrong note- DONT ACCEPT IT!!! You will experience this if you use the taxis. If the taxidriver insists that you fall for this scam- just tell them to take you to policestation (Touristpolice has a yellow building by St. Sofya Museum- they speak english)- always remember to take a pic of numberplate or write it down on paper- then go to police and tell them. This scam will not stop if you dont help to do so. So NEVER give drivers a 50TRY note- and dont accept this scam!!! Normal fare taksim square to museum is TRY10-15.If you go from the Taksim Square you can easily take the BUS 54HT & 36T (Hask\u00f6y direction)- departs just opposite MacD restaurant. Price is TRY1,5- you pay to the guy in booth on your left when you enter. You will not receive a ticket. The bus stops right outside the museum- you can not miss it. To make bus stop the \"stop button\" are just above the 2 rear doors.The museum is situated on a former shipyard- has a large collection of vintage cars, ships, u boat, airplanes which you can visit. Small train to drive in, visit replicas of old shops, collection of watches, cameras, trains, tecnical maschines.- miniature trains etc etc. When in need of a pitstop you will find small cafees all over the museum...Its a working museum and very hands on- and indeed very informative. Visit to uboat and sailing on Halic are conducted for a fee.Istanbul has so much history and historical places to see- if you need a break and want to experience something else- take to tour to Rahmi M Koc and The Miniaturk museum. And why not combine it with a visit to Eyup Sultan area, opposite side of Halic- take the teleferik to Pierre Lotti cafe for a simit and tea- and enjoy the view of the Golden Horn.Enjoy Istanbul- Istanbul Cok G\u00fcsel!"

            "review": "Hobbies Turned into a Museum. This private museum is named, owned and managed by the Turkish tycoon Rahmi Ko\u00e7. On the shores of Golden Horn, it's a modern complex displaying a permanent exhibition on Turkish history of transportation, industry and communication. Planes, trains, cars, boats, submarines, bycycles, motorcycles, different types of engines, even an olive oil factory are displayed along with first industrial professions and tools. A short ride with an old train is part of the entrance fee, however, submarine tour is subject to additional payment. Inside the boat, there is also an exhibition on model boats. A part of the museum is dedicated to items collected during the world tour Rahmi Ko\u00e7 made couple of years ago with his boat. Indeed, majority of the artifacts displayed at the museum are from his personel collections. Therefore, it would not be wrong to state that his personal hobbies that lasted for years just led to this museum. The museum visit would be best for children and those who are interested in industrial topics. Its 4 different restaurants, 1 big terrace with a wonderful view of Golden Horn and 1 big meeting room are also available for other pruposes like business meetings, coktails and similar special events. Though the museum is quite impressive, when ranked among the other attractions in Istanbul, it can not be defined as a must. It would be interesting to visit only if all other major museums are visited and there is not much else left to do, except if the industrial history is very appealing to you."
