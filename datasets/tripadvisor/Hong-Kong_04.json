The truth is, only the central business district and some \"new towns\" in Hong Kong can be described as a concrete jungle. Most areas in Hong Kong are green green GREEN hills, covered entirely in grass and trees. Go for a hike on Dragon's Back and you'll know what I mean. The starting point and ending point of the trail are conveniently located. The views at some high points of the trail are breath-taking. Bring a lot of water though - you'll want to drink it."

Beautiful views of the sea, the islands and the hills - you would never think Hong Kong has this side to it! The trek is not too challenging but I would definitely advise wearing proper sports shoes as it does get a bit steep and rocky in places, and stock up on water and few snack for the road :)"

I have been to lots of trails in hongkong, but this one will at the top of my list. As far as difficulty is concerned, the beginning 40-50min will be really difficult but last 2hr or so will easy when getting down to the big wave bay. One you reach the peak, you get a awesome view as as one your way to peak."

Gets very busy weekends so try on a weekday and only go in good weather as otherwise it's pointless. There's a number of options you can take, the best is to start at Shek O Road, almost near Shek O, then end up at Big Wave Bay, plenty of sites to give you directions if you Google it. If you're into hiking or just want to escape the city, Dragons Back is definitely worth it and can be done in a morning or afternoon."

A simple MTR ride to Shau Kei Wan station and exit A3 to the bus terminal. Signs will be everywhere directing one to the bus heading towards Dragon's back trail, alternatively look for like-minded people carrying backpacks or in trekking attire. A pleasant 2.5h walk from start to end (which is the Shek O' beach or Big Wave Bay). The total distance covered would be about 8.5km. A scenic view at the peak. Some may choose to turn back to the start after conquering the peak. But we kept walking till we saw more directions, leading us to the beach. The waves were huge! If you could surf, go for it. Perfect waves for surfers. A direct bus ride from the beach would bring you back to the bus terminal. Simple! Bring along water and some bites, but please don't leave the garbage behind. Respect the nature :)"

A nice place to get away from the busy city. It was easy to access via bus 9 from Shau Kei Wan MTR station. You catch it to To Tei Wan. I think it's best to go from there to big wave bay so there's a swim to look forward to at the end. The walk around two hours to complete. The number 9 bus also stops at big wave bay and takes you back to shau kei Wan MTR. I recommend making sure you take cash with you as they only accept cash in the minibus from big wave bay."

We did it in the early morning with our 2 little ones - 7 and 10 - and yes some whinging but they did it and enjoyed it at the end. It's a long hike for them and it was hot (mid-August) and very humid. We missed the route down to the Shek O Village directly and went up to the top of the peak and then round back through the trees. Awesome scenery but it made it longer! Had to then get the bus round to Shek O but all was good with noodles and drinks by the beach.No sooner had we sat down for food than there was the most amazing rainstorm with thunder and lots of lightening - it wouldn't have been nice had we been caught up the top in the storm.This is another side of HK - away from the amazing city - and it's incredible.Some guy biked up as well and passed us (at speed) on the way down. Very impressive."

It is probably the most crowded hike in Hong Kong so beware...there will likely be a lot of people on this trail. If you enjoy hiking and especially if you are an experienced hiker, perhaps skip this one especially if you cannot avoid doing on the weekend. Find trails that are less sought after throughout Hong Kong in the New Territories, Sai Kung and Plover Cove. If you like to a bit of a challenge, I recommend Lantau Peak and Sunset Peak for some great views on Lantau. Do the research for hikes to your liking! It will be worth it! Hiking is very popular and there are four major trails, The Hong Kong Trail (which Dragon's Back is section 8) on the island, Wilson Trail which runs from the island to the Chinese border, the MacLehose Trail which is the longest and incorporates most of the high peaks in the New Territories and the Lantau Trail on Lantau (Bid Buddha is on this island).

The 'Dragon's back is officially sections 8 and 9 of the HK trail with a distance of 9.8km from the 'start' on Shek O road at the bus stop to Shek O itself (not Big Wave Bay).Starting up from the Bus stop, actually the majority of the climbing is in the first 1.8km upto the summit of the Dragon's Back. It's an easy trail really with multiple 'get out' options. Once at the top of the Dragon's back the trail slopes down a few hundred steps to a contour trail. Turn right at on the contour trail and it's 1.9km to a paved road. At the road turn right again and follow it to the bottom of Pottingers Peak near a Gazebo (This is Pottingers Gap). Follow some 30m past the Gazebo turn sharp right (careful not too miss this) and follow a technical trail down to Big Wave Bay.Some notes:1. The trail on a sunny Sunday can get really really busy.2. Some hikers insist on using Umbrella's completely unnecessarily, so watch out.3. Do wear proper sports shoes. The number of people I have seen wearing work shoes or high heels (really!) is amazing.4. Take water.5. Careful walking down the final section from Pottingers' Gap into Big Wave Bay. It can be very slippy, and it's quite technical.There are also plenty of place to eat and drink in Big Wave Bay, but, if you want to extend your walk for 2km further simply follow the road @ Big Wave Bay, past the carpark into Shek O (straight on at the roundabout).Time-wise please allow from 40mins to 2 hours depending on your speed."

Less than 20 minutes' drive from the heart of Central, The Dragon's Back is an undulating 8.5 kilometer urban oasis unknown to most Hong Kong visitors and unseen even by most locals. That's a pity. For this is a beautiful hike. From Shek O Peak you have panoramic views down to the beaches and out to the offshore islands. My buddy, a local, insisted on an early morning hike, \"You'll be glad! The views are great!\" My hopes he had forgotten were crushed by his 6 am call to my Central hotel...In the first place, I recommend you go early both because the crowds are smaller but also because the heat and humidity are less intense (often a factor in tropical Hong Kong).Second, bring some water. I didn't and regretted the omission.Third, bring a camera because you are in for some staggeringly beautiful views.Fourth, check the weather reports. Half way into our hike...it rained. It was sufficient to solve the heat problem but not the thirst problem. It also created a manageable problem of being soaked. On the other hand, it made for something of an adventure, especially narrated in retrospect as now.Fifth, carefully arrange your transportation. We took a taxi there but hadn't arranged one in advance to pick us up. We waited perhaps 15 minutes (in the rain) for one to come by and we faced competition with other hikers (perhaps nature puts one in a more Darwinian mindset). I understand you can take a bus here (detailed in other reviews). I imagine ride sharing, assuming you get cell reception (mine was erratic), is another possibility."

I left my hotel at 6:30am in order to reach the starting entrance for Dragon's Back early morning, in the hope that the slightly cooler temperature would make a massive difference. You can reach Dragons Back by taking the MTR to Shau Kei Wan Station, take Exit A3 and then get on bus 9 at the Bus Terminus. Most people get off at stop 12 which is titled 'To Tei Wan' and begin the trail from there.I'm not incredibly fit and don't often hike but this was quite manageable, I did have to stop several times for a rest but I think that was more to do with the humidity, rather than the trail itself. I only walked a small portion, simply up to the viewing point before returning back the way I came, in summer the heat was just too unbearable. I wanted to head back to the bus stop and continue onto Shek O after, but I was absolutely exhausted and drenched so headed back to the hotel instead.

It is a long way up, mainly consisting of stone or gravel stairs. Lots and lots of stairs. It is always hot and humid in Hong Kong, so take a lot of water, some snacks, a hat, and a towel for the sweat. We only got about a quarter of the way, but loved the view from where we got to. We took oranges, chips and water which were all appreciated on the descent."

It is a longish day, but a day we look forward to. The Dragon's Back is the end of a long day and the views are just fabulous. From the start of the Dragon's Back the hike can be done in between 1.5-3.5 hours depending on your fitness. Between April and September 2 litres of water per head recommended otherwise 1 litre."

There are multiple entry spots to start the hike, allowing you to pick how long you really want to go. I prefer to start from the Chai Wan MTR station, through the cemetery and onto the path. This hike is very busy on weekends and days with great weather. If you can do the hike on a weekday morning to avoid the large crowds and really be able to take your time. It is a great hike to take pictures of Hong Kong, see the landscape and unwind. It is not a paved path so dress appropriately. Bring sufficient water for 2-3 hours, sun screen, and a towel for sweat. We prefer to end the hike and take a cab/bus to Shek O and have Thai food afterwards - believe me, you will have earned it."

The hike is easy to medium and is as nice as it gets, with views of ocean, islands, hills, etc. For visitors who want to experience a side of HK but not overdo it, I would recommend starting from To Tei Wan, leisurely hike to Shek O Peak (taking plenty of time to take in the views along the way) then turn around, hike back down then spend the rest of the day at Shek O beach or Shek O village to make it a special day."

One of our co-hikers who is a HK resident told us that the place is a heaven for many paragliders and kite flyers (although as we went in July, when its really hot, we didnt find any).The easiest way to reach the hike is to take the MTR (HK island line) and get down at Shau Kei Wan Station. From the Shau Kei Wan bus terminus, which is close to the MTR station, we have the bus no. 9 available, which takes one to Tei Wan, Shek O road. Just cross the road and start the trail. From the top of the viewing platform at Shek O peak, one can find great views of the neighbouring islands. Being hot and sunny, we were able to take clear pictures of all the surrounding islands.June-July are the hottest months and the sun bakes down really hard. At many places, the path does not have a tree cover and hence it is imperative that one keeps fluid levels high. Also there no restrooms/ snacking places along the hike and it makes sense to use one before starting the hike. We were able to cover the route in about 3 hours and ended up at the Shek O Beach."

Checked in to hotel and then took the MTR from airport to Hong Kong island transfer to Shau Kei Wan station. This took about 1 hour one way, costs about $120 HKD )or $12 USD). Met my tour guide Rory Mackay at the train station. From there, we took a bus to the hike. I probably would not find this hike by myself. The hike is about 10K or 6-7 miles, up and down hills... Not a difficult hike but when going up hill... It does take a breath out off me. It is very scenic with the view of the city at the peak. At the end of the dragon back before heading down to the big wave beach, there is a public bathroom. From there, another 1-2 mile or so down hill to the beach. There are no bathroom during the hike... So use bathroom before starting. It took us about 3 hours total...So, if you have 6 hour layover, this may cut close.if you have about 8 hour layover, this is doable.*use bathroom before heading down to the beach since there is no bathroom for the next mile until you get to the beach."

The first hour was more difficult since it ascended more quickly and the trail was unshaded. But soon we were high up on the mountain ridge and had a full embracing view of the South China Sea and the islets. It was pretty relaxing just to sit and soak in the view (if you can stand the temprature). Later the trail started to descend after some sharper ascending to the Dragon's Back platform with a signage showing a picture of the surrounding islands. The downhill trail was relatively easy and there was abundant shade. We ate our packed lunch right beside a stream of spring, which was very soothing and helped us recover some energy. Finally we got to the Shek O Village and treated ourselves with cold beer and coconuts. We regretted not bringing stuff for the beach, but just sitting there and watching people enjoying themselve in the water was also interesting. We'll be heading to Scotland and will do some hiking in less than 2 months, so this was good practice ahead."

This is a hike of modest difficulty that offers wonderful views and a few logistical challenges, mostly associated with getting their and getting back when you are finished. Taxis and buses are the best options for transport. For those who have their appetite whetted for more action, the 'Twins' (also known as the 'Vale of Pain') offers a 'step up' in physical challenge. Both of these hikes are achievable in a morning or an afternoon."

Hiker usually start their hike by riding Bus no. 9 from Shau Kei Wan station to the Shek O entry point of the trail, up the trail and descend to Tai Tam Gap. I reversed the hike, starting from Chai Wan station. We walked up though a huge cemetery up a lot of stairs and reached the trail entrance, which is through a small metal gate. After that it was just following the trail and signs. It involves quite a lot of steep up and down hills. The trail gets muddy and slippery after rain and there are some narrow places to get pass.The view of the southern part of Hong Kong Island on Dragon's back is fantastic and mind-blowing. You see three beaches and some scattered green islands and the vast pacific ocean.Mountain biking is allowed on the trail.Worth visiting"

The first three or so kilometres were uphill or up steps so a bit challenging but after that it was a lot easier. Once up the top the views were lovely with a light breeze to cool you down. When the walk went through the forest it was a lot cooler. For us the last 2 kms were probably the hardest even though it was relatively flat, I guess it was a fairly long walk around 8.5 kms. It took us about 2.5 hours to walk the whole track. There were alot of other people walking the track as well but this didn't bother us at all as everything just flowed along. At the end there is a nice clean beach where we had a swim.There are good facilities to have a quick shower and get changed again for trip back. There are buses back to the MTR from here or to Shek O. Also there are only toilets at the beginning and the end of the walk."

We heard that there are many challenging tracks here but being our first, we chose Dragon's back so that we will not be overwhelmed or complacent in our approach.To get there, we took the MTR to Shau Kei Wan Station, leaving through Exit A3 and boarded bus 9 at Shau Kei Wan Bus Terminus to To Tei Wan, Shek O Road. On the bus we could feel the ascend as the road became narrower and the views along the way absolutely gorgeous. Many locals even the elderly, walk the trail daily for exercise and will greet you with a \"Cho San\" or \"Good Morning\" along the way. We were at the peak after approximately 50mins of uphill walking along the undulating path. The view along the way and at Shek Oh peak is beautiful. The downward journey is just as good and we continued to the Tai Long Wan or Big wave beach was a welcome sight. We got to one of the little coffee shops, ordered our beers, chips before we headed back to Shau Kei Wan bus terminal on a minibus and MTR to the city. Hope you will enjoy this trail and many others in Hong Kong, on our next visit it will be the Tung Chung to Tai O and the Sai Kung trails!"

            "review": "Classic trail - the short version. Dragon's Back is a classic HK hiking trail which you don't have to be super-fit for, although there are a lot of stairs. The official route starts at a village and ends at Big Wave bay beach, but we did a shorter version just for the view. It took about 3-4 hours, accounting for the stopping and taking photos. Pack sunscreen even if it's cloudy and the UV index is high; several parts of the walk are not sheltered and we still got sunburned through the cloud cover. Portaloo toilets are at the start and end of the walk only.Following the advice from some local hiking friends, we took the No.9 bus from Shau Kei Wan MTR exit A3, and got off at Cape Collinson stop (the screen on the bus announces the name of each stop). I think doing the route from here works for two reasons. 1) you get the boring bit out the way first, where it's through woodland, flat and you can't see much. The view can only get better. 2) there are fewer uphill steps to get to the top. You'll still need to hop on the bus again at the end of the walk if you want to see Shek O and the beach, and there's a bus stop right at the end of the last flight of steps as you finish the trail. Buses are every 20mins either to Shek O, or cross the road for a bus back to the MTR. As we were waiting the red minibus drivers were a little aggressive in trying to get you to take their bus instead of the double-decker, but beware - their fares are more expensive (more than double!) and they don't take Octopus card - cash only.You get a fairly good variety. Some of it is concreted walkways, but a lot of it is knobbly compacted soil/clay, rocks/boulders and stepping over tree roots in the woodland part. Not sure what the soil/clay sections would be like in heavy rain. There's shaded woodland, windy hilltops, exposed paths, and the views are stunning from the top. If you see signs for the 'Adventure Trail', don't bother unless you've packed a machete - even though the trail is a shortcut, it's too overgrown. Apparently you can mountain bike up/down the trail; some stairs have slopes along the edges but they're narrow (only a few inches) and the shrubs are overgrown so won't be much space for handlebars. A cyclist we met said he ended up walking most of it, carrying his bike over his shoulder. At the top of the peak there's an information board so you can pick out landmarks. Definitely an enjoyable day out!"

Once there you will be treated to panoramic views of the surrounding islands and city. The hike on the ridge is very hot in the summer as it is exposed, but eventually enters a shaded vegetated section that you continue along as you descend. This is cooler. But the route ends on a nice beach complete with changing rooms and showers, and in our case, a much needed beer!The hike is fairly easy going, the most difficult ascent is soon over and done with.

Starting out from Chai Wan MTR exit A, over the Wan Tsui Rd overhead walk way, then southwest up the road , turning left up Lin Shing Rd to the junction of Collinson Cape Rd. Cross the road into the cemetery. With a new building construction on your left , take the staircase on your left next to the new building, up through the cemetery grounds. There are a few stairs to the top with might take about 20minutes to climb to the top. About half way up, the stairs come out on a switch back of an internal cemetery road. Follow road thru the switch back for about 80 meters, then you will see the restart of the steps upwards again. The last section of the stairs is less used and going into the tree cover but continue to the top where you will come out on Section 8 of the Hong Kong Trail at Pottinger Gap shelter and guide map. You can go left to Big Wave Beach/ Tai Long Wan Village /or head off in a West by North West direction along a well formed road to Tai Tam Gap to walk across the Dragon's back. The road winds a bit passing some picnic shelters until you come to a 3 way sign post showing the way to Shek O Peak and Dragon's Back . Continue up walkway. A short while later you pass a large above ground water reservoir and that is where an unformed dirt track begins. There are some uneven surfaces and slippery earthen trail/tree roots and rock sections in places, so wear appropriate footwear and clothing. The track is well sign posted from there onwards, right through the descent to the To Tei Wan Bus Shelter on Shek O Road, where you catch Bus 9 back Shai Kei Wan Terminus. As I had only one free day to do the walk whilst in HK, the weather was far from ideal, overcast, light rain, with heavy fog/mist once on mountain and down the southern ridges. Walking in the damp mist/fog is ok, with appropriate gear, but in my whole journey across the Dragon's Back, visibility was limited to about 80 meters or much less in some places, with high buffering winds from the South, which were at mountain peak locations or along (unseen) exposed ridges. It took me just over 2 hours from start at the cemetery gates to finish at the To Tei Wan Bus Shelter. Wear appropriate footwear, clothing and take adequate water and snacks as you will be on your own most of the journey(unless you get a brilliant day and everyone decides to take the walk.)On the day, I would have come across about 30 other hikers(in small groups) enduring the conditions but all were heading in the opposite direction i.e. South to North. As a consequence of the poor weather, it was probably one of the worse days for taking in the scenery, I missed out on the fabulous views that others may have experienced or captured with their cameras..... so next time in HK, I'll have to pick a better day to walk the Dragon's Back."

We went in April during the rainy and foggy season, so our views weren't the clearest but the weather was perfect. Go on a weekday and it won't be too crowded. The views are the best. Bring along some snacks to enjoy them while taking a rest."

Actually we planned to end at the beach area below the mountain but it seems like we took a wrong turn and ended up back at the starting point.The weather was very cooling and it was very foggy. It was an experience we will never encounter back in Singapore.I gonna say the hike was quite tiring as there are a lot of uphill and down slopes which can be very slippery and it can be quite dangerous if you were to fall. Please wear proper shoes with extremely good grip for the hike.To get there, simply take bus 9 from shau kei wan bus terminus and alight at To Tei Wan. Worth checking out when you are in Hong Kong."

No facilities on the walk so take drinks. Good views but so slowwwwww. Lots of walkers some walking painfully slowly. It's a reasonably easy walk if used to exercise, just need comfortable shoes, fluid and sun protection.You can watch the para gliders and extend your walk to a beach before heading back into the city."

A different view to Hong Kong away from the hustle and bustle of city life. But you need to eat some food first before hiking. Because there are few street vendors in there.

We walked through lush vegetation, some areas with tall trees other areas quite open, a few small waterfalls. Views for most of first half, less for second half as you descend. Trail was a mixture of steps and paths, some of it quite rocky and some parts quite steep, need proper shoes/runners. We were looking forward to dipping our feet in the water at Big Wave Beach but were very disappointed to discover that there was a \"red tide\" and so the beach was unsuitable for swimming. Another unfortunate consequence of the pollution. We had cold drinks and hot chips at the beach side cafe and chilled for a bit before catching the small bus up the road to Shek O. Again the beach no good for swimming but we sat out in the rocks overlooking the water for a while. Much bigger selection of restaurants and places to eat here. Found our number 9 bus and headed back. You need to be reasonably fit, our 7 and 10yo kids had no problems. No toilets or drinks/food available on the track.

The taxi ride was about HKD60 and was about 10minutes. The driver stopped us just at the start of the trail. The climb along Dragon's Back trail is a relatively mild trek (which you can do with kids from 10). We stopped a few times to admire the coastline and views. Depends on how long and how many pit stops you make, the whole expedition should take 2-3hours. We took the route that led us to Big Wave Bay. This beach is located at a small village. The waves are good for surfing. There were a few surfers and sunbathers on the beach.We ate lunch at a small coffee shop that served a good beef brisket meal. Walked out to the bus-stop and waited for a shuttle that took us to Shau Kei Wan."

The beginning up to Shek O Peak was a bit of a slog for us nearly sixty somethings but as the name implies, the ground undulates as it ascends, giving relief along the way. The views are stupendous , the flora lush but sometimes ones way is impeded by the Hong Konger's desire to selfie at any opportunity. Although well maintained most of the way,there are some hairy moments, especially on the descent, were one is climbing down hard uneven rock, crossed by little streams, making it slippery. The Hong Kong Tourist Board describes the 8k trail as moderately difficult & with that I would concur. But the rewards are great."

Force their 4 year old children to walk on uneven mud road because the parents too tired to hold them....... This is a 3 stars trail out of 5. I would say more suitable for kid start from 8-9 year old.- I saw many people coming from Shek O Beach direction, end in Shek O Country Park. But personally would recommended going the other way around. Starting this trail from Tai Tam Gap Correctional Institution to Shek O Beach via Dragon's Back. So that the better view will come along to you. Plus the road is quite steep once you enter Shek O Country Park. Better to walk up hill then down hill.

Best done early in the morning, or early evening, to beat the heat.Remember to carry some water and food as there is absolutely nothing other than natural beauty all around!"

Do not go here if you have hip or knee problems because you'll experience lots of up and down hills. The hike is about an hour or two going one way and make sure you bring your own food and water because you won't find any stores along the trail."

A welcome respite from the concrete and glass canyons of Hong Kong and Kowloon. Easy to get to starting spot on the MTR subway system. Be sure to wear hiking boots/sturdy trail shoes and it can be slippery when wet. Bring swimming gear in warmer months and it is possible to rent surf and boogie boards right at the beach."

The hike is only 8.5 km to Big Wave Bay (nice beach) but it will take you a good 2 hours or so as it is up and down and can get busy (narrow but safe). It can get very hot up there so climate cool gear is ideal. It's a lot of steps and some uneven terrain so a reasonable level of fitness is required. Bear in mind once you get to Big Wave Bay and if you want to go onto Shek O you will need to be cashed up. Restaurants on the front are pricey and there are no ATMs and it's pretty much cash only here. You might want to put some swimming gear in your back-pack."

I was told by friends to either choose the Dragon's Back or Sai Kung route, with the former being relatively easy and more manageable for a solo hike. The route up was really easy, and the views up Dragon's Back absolutely beautiful on a sunny day! You'll get a bird's eye view of the coastal areas bordering the South China Sea and Shek O beach; the sea looks endless as the different hues of blues of the sky and the sea gently touch. To get there, take bus 9 from Shau Kei Wan MTR station for a scenic 25 min journey up to Shek O road (sit on the upper deck!). Stop at To Tei Wan and you'll see the start of the trek nearby. I took a couple of stops to soak in the view, and took about 2.5 hours to complete my hike. The latter half (about 1 hour),where you descend from dragon's back, is less scenic in the forrested areas. Take the time to think hard about whether you should have Yat Lok roasted goose and char Siew or dim sum (or both) for dinner :p Tough decisions! At the end of the trial you could choose to go down to Big Wave Beach, but that will take another one hour down to the beach and another up to Siu Sau Wan, where you can catch a bus back to the nearest MTR.Definitely go on a sunny day where the views are best! Avoid going on a wet day as it might make the return route a little slippery and dangerous. Enjoy!! I didn't try Sai Kung but I heard the views are even better. If you have the time, do both :-)."

As a traveler who has been to Hong Kong numerous times, I was pleasantly surprised to find the beautiful nature and landscape of the area only a short trip from bustling center. A ride on the MTR (to Shau Kei Wan Station) and a 25 min or so bus ride (#9 bus to Shek-O) up to the trail head, you find yourself hiking a wonderful trail (easy/moderate level) overlooking several beaches and fantastic panoramic views. A must do for visitors looking for a nature retreat!"

We did only the first half of the hike... I am not a sporty kind of girl and managed to do it easily. We came across 4/5 other groups of hikers maximum, it is a refreshing getaway from the crowds.Doing this hike, I had a revealing moment that made me realized what I love about HK. Whatever you're looking for, you will find it. You have the hip restaurants and bars, the markets, the temples, the shopping, the skyline, the museums, the art, the beaches, the nature. What does it lack? I am yet to find out.Highly recommend it. (Don't forget the water, the mosquito repelent, sunglasses and a hat if you'd like)"

We took a taxi from time square to the beginning of dragons back trek it came to around $180 Hong Kong dollars which is nothing in pounds for a 30 minute taxi ride, through seaside towns and small villages. Once on the trek the view were simply outstanding. We went on a clear sunny day which I'm sure helped loads. Comfy trainers is a must, sun cream, insect repellent, plenty of water and snacks! No shops anywhere once you start. We ended our trek at big wave beach. It was a welcome sight to be able to get your trainers off and enjoy the seawater. So bring some swimwear"

We hiked the whole Dragon's Back trail into Big Wave Bay, and we were blown away literally and figuratively by the wind and the views. It isn't too hard of a hike, but it's fairly long. Going with friends and taking in the amazing sights are totally worth every second of it.

Prerecorded announcement of the next stops can be heard n location flashed on a screen near the front of the bus so it is very easy to know where to get down the bus (at To Tei Wan).. Only the first part of the hike involves a climb to the views of the bay n from that onwards, a easy undulating hike.. The walk is very well signposted.. So no worries about getting lost.. I was fairly late, getting there about 230 to 3 pm on a weekday afternoon there were fair no of people doing the hike. Not too crowded so it felt like getting away from the crowd."

We took M16 minibus just outside Chai Wan Station (last MTR stop Island line) to Tai Tam Training Centre at 2pm(5-10 mins ride). We climbed a short staircase and reached the mid-point of the No. 8 trail. We turned to the right which led to the uphill path to Shek'o. The left side will go to Big Wave Bay downhill. The uphill path needed a bit of tackle and so should wear a pair of good walking shoes.The weather was perfect. It was windy at the top but was warm with Sun at the back. After 2 1/2 hr walk at leisure pace, we reached the exit where there was a bus stop. The no. 9 bus took us to the Shek-O beach. The beach is the best in HK. Had afternoon tea at one of the local stores. Perfect way to spend half a day under the December sun."

You need to wear shoes not sandals however converse or trainers are fine, you don't need walking boots. Take water and a cereal bar etc with you as there are no shops on the route. To get there take MTR blue line towards Chai Wan, get off at Shau Kei Wan station two before the end of the line. Go to the bus station outside its right there and very clear and get on the bus number 9. It's $6.50hk per adult. Ask the driver to point out the start of the dragons back walk, it's about a 20 minute ride till you get there. It's a 5km walk along the top of a ridge with beautiful views east and west looking over Stanley and other islands just beautiful. After 5km you can come off to the left and meet the shek o road and catch the number 9 back. Or if you still have energy and want to continue your walk down to the beach and catch the bus from there after a dip in the ocean! A great day out and really easy to do. Cheap too...enjoy!"

I reached the peak and thought I was at least half way on my way to Big Waves Beach. I wasn't ! I would estimate you are only a quarter or a third max way there. After all the views in the first half I missed them in the second through the forest but enjoyed it all. The beach is great but one TIP when u r waiting for the bus and the light bus comes with Shek O on his bus, check he REALLY is going mine took me directly back to Sha Kai Wan bus station and wafted me to the MTR bus !

This hike was absolutely perfect for my purposes. It was super easy to get to via public transportation (take MTR to Shao Kei Wan, then bus no. 9 to Cape Collision stop). Once there, the hike was pretty easy but totally gorgeous, starting off more enclosed by trees and eventually leading you to wide open spaces with amazing views of the the ocean and little towns. The trail was pretty well traveled and we met friendly people along the way. It was particularly sweet to watch a group of older men who met at the top of the peak to fly their model airplanes in the wind. The hike took maybe a little more than 2 hours with plenty of stops for photos and just to enjoy the view. We took the trail down to Shek O road and then caught the bus to take us down to Shek O beach. (PS...upon reaching the road do NOT take the super steep staircase that says Tei Wan. We did so because we weren't sure what was down there and my calves still haven't forgiven me for the journey back up.) Shek O beach is really nice as well. The town is cute and has shops and restaurants where you can fill up after working up an appetite. Would definitely go back again!"

Part of the trail is with stone steps, partially nature provided.

Then go to bus terminus adjacent to the subway station and transit to bus nr 9. The bus takes some 20 min to the start of the trail. Bus driver knows where you need to take off."

Before continuing the Big Wave Trail, there's also a trail to the cemetery on the left of the picnic area. The trail ends at the Big Wave Bay Village. You'll see a lot of surfing shops, restaurants. There's a minibus that goes back to the MTR for HKD10."

Take BUS #9 towards Shek-O, and alight at To Tei Wan stop on Shek O Road. If you're unsure when to alight, simply ask the bus driver to help.. or keep a look out for a bus stop on the slope that many alight. I would have missed the stop, if I did not bump into local hikers which told us that here's the stop for the start of the trail. Don't be afraid to ask :)My trip was back in MARCH 2015, it was humid on the main island. However under the shady pathway and forest trails, it felt really cooling and comfortable. Towards the highest point of the hike, the shades disappear and you get an aerial view of the island. I will highly recommend this trail any time of the year, except September which I feel is Hong Kong's hottest period~ Wear proper footwear, stay hydrated. There are honey bees along the trail, as there are beautiful flowers on the isles - so.. don't smell too sweet ;)"

There are clear signs on directions. When you reach Big Wave beach you can get food and refreshments and chill on the beach. Many people surf there and you can take a mini bus to Shau Kei Wan MTR."

This is a wonderful hike if you are looking for a half-day hike (2-3 hours), with beautiful views of the sea and Shek O. We read it was only supposed to be 90 minutes with an hour up and 30 minutes down but the total time ended up being closer to 2-2 1/2hrs total. Just when you think give reached the top, there are more peaks to climb! The terrain is moderat to difficult. Lots of rocks that are quite dry, dusty and slippery. I would not recommend this hike for small children or those wanting to go on a hike with animals. There were quite a few trying to make the trek up with their small dogs and they were over heated and not doing well at all. I strongly advise against it, it is not safe or meant for animals it is much too strenuous.Bring lots of water as there are no drink stations, or restroom stops along the way. Once you get to the top its well worth it but the walk down is quite long and rigerous as well."

There's a short pull up to the main ridge after 1.5km from where there are some super views of Big Wave Bay and over into HK. Thereafter it's a simple case of flowing the path. The drop right down to the road is the best route off. I tried to flow a scrubby path loosely marked on the map at the southern end of the ridge but it's was impenetrable. The one downside is the schlep to Shek O on the road. We had the dog with us so couldn't take the bus. The road slopes downhill so it's easy walking but seems to go on for ages. Also, most of it is without a pavement and the drivers can be loony. Count on 3-4 hours for the trek from start to finish in Shek O."

At the end of the trek, we chanced upon a minibus who was waiting to ferry passengers for HKD $10 each back to the MTR station (we did not expect this as its stated on the trail's website to walk back to Shek O Road to catch bus 9 back to the bus terminus).

If you think Hong Kong is a just a business centre without beauty of nature, you must have missed Dragon's Back on your place-to-go list.Dragon's back is the ridge of Shek O Peak and location of Section 8 of Hong Kong Trail. The Authority gives the trail a 3-star rating on difficulty -- Nonsense! It is an easy walk even for primary school children. On Dragon's Back you can enjoy the spectacular view of Shek O peninsula and Turtle Cove, as well as the refreshing breeze from the South China Sea. Make sure you take a pic in front of the plaque of Shek O Peak and the lumpy traverse station.As you advance along the trail, you will be out of the rural area for a moment and see the urban view of Chai Wan all of a sudden. Many visitors are amazed by this teleport-like experience.Further to the end of the trail you will be back to the village and beach of Tai Long Wan. It has been a surfers' haunt for many years (even in times of typhoon attacks). Near the beach there is a rock carving created by early inhabitants which now becomes a Declared Monument of Hong Kong.To go to Dragon's back, take NWFB Route. 9 from Shau Kei Wan MTR Station to To Tei Wan stop. To leave Tai Long Wan, take the red minibus or walk 20 minutes south to take NWFB Route. 9 back to Shau Kei Wan MTR Station."

Use toilets there as another opportunity is almost an hour away.Walking the path: the route is relatively well marked and there are only 2-3 places where you need to make a decision where to turn. In total, the hike is about 8 km long and may take 2 hours or longer, depending on your pace.Difficulty: first 30-40 min (1.5-2 km) is an uphill climb to Shek O Peak which is relatively tough. Also, there is little shade at this section so be prepared. Shortly after reaching the peak and enjoying the views on the way, you get into a forest where a beautiful nature walk begins. It's quite shady there with water streams, butterflies flying around from time to time and birds chirping. Later on, there will be a paved section and them a forest walk again when you descend towards Big Wave Bay.After finishing the hike, you can catch a bus 9 or a red minibus shuttle to Chai Wan MTR station.Good luck and enjoy!"

When I did my Googling, Dragon's Back came highly recommended. I decided to go for it as the trekkin is suitable for people with average fitness level, the place is easily accessible from MTR station and most importantly the place is astoundingly beautiful. I was happy that I made the right choice. The place meets my expectations. I started trekking at 8am and completed it at Big Wave Bay within 4 hours. Along the way I was mesmerised with beautiful sceneries that Dragon's Back is famous for and I took lots of pictures of floras and faunas. It was tiring but it was worth it. It's a different experience altogether."

I was so glad I did my research before I left for Hong Kong and insisted that this be on our itinerary during our 7-day stay. It was amazing to say the least....flat at times and but also steep which left one breathless. We were moderately fit but beware - it can be taxing. The views along the way was something to behold. From views of the oceans and beautiful beaches to high rises peeking unexpectedly between mountains to the exquisite Big Wave beach at the end. Wear good walking shoes, sunhat, sunscreen and of course your camera because there is lots to see."

A geomancer was employed to assist in the trails\u2019 development. A Dragon\u2019s breath must be able to flow freely, unimpeded. If the trail overlooked the wrong thing, or had indifferent fung shui, then it is out of luck, bad fortune. A geomancer mitigates the bad effects. This trail sits on the tip of a dragon\u2019s tail. Chinese dragons sleep in the body of mountains, large hills, and it is exceedingly bad fung shui to disturb a dragon by building on top of one - at least, that is, until a geomancer has persuaded it to sleep elsewhere, as can be done because Chinese dragons are benevolent if shown respect and proper regard. Nevertheless, it is fine fung shui to build close to a dragon: overlooking the harbour water, and then the Gau Lung Mountains which contain no less than nine dragons."

The hike itself wasn't so difficult, what made it really hard was the weather. It was a hot day, middle of August and the air was so humid that it was extremely difficult to breathe at times. The first half was a climb up which has great views on the way as well. Then you get to the dragon's back (you'll see a sign saying you're there) and it's a great panoramic view. After that it gets less interesting, going back down through a forest, but there are some small waterfalls that are nice and the trail is much easier going down.

It has an amazing view over the sea and city and nearby villages. You walk a path along the top of a mountain and I advise to just stop regularly to just admire the view. It will take a long time so take with you a bottle of water or two and maybe some fruit or other snack. I got a bit confused by the end, I didn't know where to go when the Dragon's Back ended so I followed a path along the mountain for maybe 20 minutes and didn't know where I would end up. I kept on walking and eventually reached a road with signs and I went toward Big Wave beach and it took me 20-30 minutes to reach. From there is a bus back to the main city."

My first attempt to hike Dragon's back was foiled by the rain, but I did return! Hearing that this hike was easy by my friends, I journeyed the whole time in flip flops alongside my best friend! Of course the hike was hot, but it was easy as well and we enjoyed talking during the whole hike. The views were spectacular and it was easy enough to find the starting location. My friend and I got turned around and couldn't find the path to the beach but we still had an excellent time. This is a great beginner hike or hike for a tourist who wants to see some beautiful natural views during their time in Hong Kong"

Just a short MTR and bus ride away from WanChai where we stayed was the trekking route up to the famed Dragon's Back in HK on HK island itself. as the bus left the city and climbed through the verdant lush forests, the scenery changed from one of crowded urbanscape to a refreshing vista of greenery and glimpses of the sea! the trek entrance from Shek O road was clearly marked and the easy route took just minutes to break out of the forest cover to the bare hill trail as we ascended onto the Dragon's Back itself. Its an easy climb by all accounts and totally worth it for an experience in HK that is for nature lovers and for the incredible views. We did the whole trail and finished down at BIG WAVE bay some 3 hours later to refresh ourselves in the cool waters as the surf rolled in. An altogether rustic morning side tour that was a beneficial for the soul as it was to work off some calories from the gastronomical offerings of HK!"

Following the well detailed instructions on how to get to the trailhead by other reviewers I started out. I was lucky to have reached the peak of Shek O right as the rain and thunder started. Knowing that I could either turn back or continue on I decided to continue. All in all it was a wonderful hike. Make sure you do have good hiking shoes or hiking sandals. I found that the path in various places was quite slick and could use some attention and maintenance. If you are a bit more unsteady on your feet while hiking, carrying a retractable pole may not be a bad idea. As other reviewers mentioned from the road to Big Wave Bay it does take about 2 hours. When you reach the jogging path where the bathroom is, there are 2 options: 1) to go to some gap or 2) to continue on to Big Wave Bay 2.5 km away. The first km of this will be hiking on the jogging path with whatever runners happen to be out and about. Once your reach a little park, you veer to the right through the park. Right after the park the path does split into 2--I forget where the other side went, but to get to Big Wave Bay you continue down a little side trail with steps to the right for the final 1.5 km. Once in Big Wave Bay, if you keep walking straight effectively, you will reach the bus stop. As it was still rainy I opted not to spend any time in Big Wave Bay. I did end up having to switch mini buses but a local helped me with that."

To be honest I could probably have done the hike without a guide as it's a well used path and there is good signposting - the only bits that aren't too well marked are the bus stops at the beginning and end so they might prove a bit tricky to find. Saying that I am glad that I did have a guide with me, I'm travelling alone so, as well as getting me to the right bus stops, it was great to have someone to chat with and someone to point out what we could see as we were walking (my guide was Rory at Wild Hong Kong and I'll be giving him five stars when I review my tour with him shortly.) It was a nice, not particularly strenuous walk - although there are quite a few steps to climb in parts. Quite a bit of the walk is shaded and when I did it there was quite a nice breeze on the ridge but it was still very humid so make sure you take lots of water and sun lotion. Oh and give yourself a spray of bug spray before you to, I didn't and came back with a few bites in my legs.At the end of the walk you get to Big Wave Bay which has a couple of shops, a nice cafe and a lovely beach if you want to cool off after your walk. It was nice to see so much nature and tranquility so close to such a huge hustling bustling city like Hong Kong."

I saw two guys running the track in the heat! Keen or crazy, you decide. Once you reach the Shek O Peak, it's pretty flat going until the descent to Big Wave Bay.

Make sure to bring at least 1,5 liter water and a snack per person on a hot day, as you won't find any water or food on the hike. -Toilets:There are 2 toilets at the start of the trail and there's one when you have finished about three quarters of the hike, it's somewhere on the pavement part of the hike and there is a sign that can not be missed. -How to get here:Take the MTR to Shau Kei Wan station and take exit A3. From there you will find all the buses, take bus 9 and get out at the To Tei Wan station. There is usually a sign in the bus which displays the next stop so keep checking it. The bus drive will take about 15-20 minutes. It will cost around 9 HKD if I remember correctly and can be payed with the octopus card. When you get out at the bus stop, just follow the signs of the trail and you will walk correctly. If you want, you can also walk the trail until you end at Big Wave Bay beach. For this, follow the signs to big wave bay beach which appear halfway in the hike. At Big Wave Bay beach there are some restaurants where you can eat. The beach has also lockers, toilets and changing rooms. - How to get back to the MTR from Big Wave Bay beach:Just walk past all the restaurants, all the way to the top. There the mini buses stop, which will take you straight to Shau Kei Wan MTR for 12 HKD. You have to pay in cash when leaving the bus, you can't pay with your octopus card. "

The middle and end of the hike is through bushland and is not exposed, so the walk gets easier, as far as heat is concerned. The walk isn't too challenging, so medium hiking experience is probably all you need, but if you have any issues with walking it is probably not the walk for you. It took me 4 hours to complete the walk which ended at a beach on a public holiday, so it was teaming with people and colourful umbrellas. Remember to pack your swimmers! The water was warm and so refreshing after a great experience. There is toilets, changeroom and showers available for use at the beach, along with eateries and a pub of sorts. You can also buy beach items (swimmers, boogie boards etc.) if you have forgotten to bring your own. The walk itself introduces you to the local flora, and even some fauna - we came across a snake which looked like it had gotten its head caught in a hole, probably trying to eat a mouse or something and unable to fit its head back out again; and I wasn't willing to help it. Loved everything about it, especially the feeling of accomplishment. I DID IT!! One less thing off my bucket list."

If you are a senior citizen just take it easy on the steep part at the beginning.Fortunately we were accompanied by a friend who hikes the trail on a regular basis.

Leave the place by minibus waiting outside though slightly more pricey at $10 which saves you the walk out to the main road to take bus 9 back to mtr.Dragon's back is definitely worth a visit! Choose a cooler season like autumn and winter. Bring lots of water and food as well as insect repellent as mosquitoes abound in summer.

It's a quick train ride on the MRT Blue line (Chai Wan) to Shau Kei Wan Station. From Shau Kei Wan Station we use Exit A3 to the Bus Terminus, then take bus 9 . The beginning of the Trail is on Shek O Road, near To Tei Wan village. We were a bit anxious about how to know when to get off the bus but several other people were doing the same thing and the bus driver also seemed quite used to helping uncertain tourists. We took our time on the walk and really loved the view far into the distance on both sides after we climbed up to the ridge and began walking along the top. The path is very well marked and maintained but the wind was pretty strong that day and at some spots almost blew us over. The total hike is said to take 6hrs (and probably does if you walk slowly to appreciate the view and have a break along the way for a picnic). However we were a bit pushed for time and took the opportunity to do only the first 5km exiting down towards Cape Collinson Rd from the toilet area at the northwest section before Pottinger Gap. This shorter section took us only about 2hrs. From here it was easy to pick up Bus 9 once more, back to Shau Kei Wan Station. The full walk looked a bit more confusing about where to go when you eventually get to the end! It was great to escape the hustle and bustle of urban Hong Kong for a few hours and the views were spectacular. We really enjoyed the walk. It's not very challenging and so is assessable to anyone with just average fitness. We met lots of families along the way and the kids were really enjoying the scramble."

The map and arrows on the trail aren't always clear and we should have headed right on the paved area to get to the ShekO beach and instead turned left.

The distance is 8.5km and is accessible by public transport at the start and finish of the hike so is very easy to get to and from.To get to the starting point take the MTR to Shau Kei Wan Station, exit A3. Take bus 9 at Shau Kei Wan bus terminal to To Tei Wan on the Shek O road. The bus will pass the Tai Tam Rd roundabout and turn onto Shek O Rd. Along the road there will be a car park with a view point, (there were lots of cars and mini vans parked in it when we went so you cant miss it), get off at the next stop. This is where the trail for the final section of the Hong Kong trail starts. There is a public toilet there. We had printed the map from the Discover Hong Kong website and showed the driver where we wanted to get off. He knew exactly where is was and stopped for us.The first part of the hike has steps as it climbs away from the road. It walks through forests and bushy vegetation. You will come to a trail split where you can take the Dragons Back section or keep walking through the forest and bypass the mountain climb. We chose the Dragons Back. It keeps climbing and crosses the spine of a couple of peaks. The views are great. The path is a bit rugged but not difficult. From there you will descend back to the forest level and meet up with the easier path. Many people use this path for jogging. Follow this path around through the forest and you will eventually get to an asphalt road with a public toilet. We turned right and headed to Big Wave Bay. This was easy and took us to a small park with a pavilion. Follow the path through the park and the path to Big Wave Bay turns right and descends through the forest via steps all the way to the small village Tai Long Wan. Keep heading straight through the village and you will end up at the sea. There are big clean change rooms, toilets and showers at the beach. The water is clear and pleasantly cool. For those timid about swimming the beach is netted and there are lifeguards. The hike has markers along the way and the final marker just outside the village is H100. This is the final marker of the full Hong Kong Trail (50km in distance) To leave just walk out of the village on the road along the coast. At the top of a small hill there is a big bus stop/car parking area. We grabbed a small public bus which took us back to Shau Kei Wan. It cost $10 HKD and does not take Octopus cardIt took us 2 hours to walk the distance and we stopped to take many photos. It is not a hard hike but the ground is uneven in places and has steps to climb up and down. Saw a couple at the start of the trail only 100 metres in. She was in thongs and complaining bitterly. I doubt they went much further. Sunscreen and water are needed. Bathers, towel and camera are a must as well. After reading about the crowds that walk the trail on weekends we decided to do the trail on a Monday morning. Saw only 4 people on the trail proper, but about 20 people on the easier section going through the forest. These were joggers using this part of the trail for exercise.We found information on this hike - and others, at the very informative www.discoverhongkong.com and also there are a couple of really good hiking books that could be found in any bookshop in HK. I think this hike is in the Serious Hikers Guide to Hong Kong."

Dragon's Back is one of the best hikes / walks in Hong Kong for all ages. While there are quite a lot of steps, you don't have to be in great shape to do it (just don't take your kids in strollers as I saw a lot of people carrying strollers up the steps which is crazy). A good pair of shoes, water, and maybe a picnic lunch should be perfect. What is Dragon's Back?\"Dragon\u2019s Back\" refers to a hike along the ridge of Shek O Peak. It is 284 metres high, with great views of Shek O, Tai Long Wan and even Tung Lung Island. Also, it is Part 8 of the Hong Kong Trail (a 50km trail that has 8 parts). It will typically take 2-2.5 hours to hike and enjoy the scenery.How to get there?There are a few different ways, I chose to take the MTR to Chai Wan (Exit A).then walk there through the Cape Collinson Catholic Cemetery entrance(take the first set of stairs on your left). There are a lot of stairs this way at the beginning but I enjoyed it. I took the bus 9 back to MTR Shau Kei Wan Station (you can also start this way if you prefer). You could also take a bus into Shek O or to the beach."

Wonderful companions, great weather, interesting and picturesque trail, good distance and reasonable challenge (though to some this may be an easy trail). The Dragon's trail delivers perfectly on a windy, cool and overcast weather just before summer kicks in. The trail has lots of greenery including bamboo, steps, uneven stones, views like Shek O golf course, eagles, butterflies, the dragon's back and ends with Big Wave Bay! What more can one ask for? We did the hike on a weekday and passed by more than 30 hikers. It is a trail for all ages - we saw hikers of different ages including young kids and older people in their sixties using hiking sticks. Lots of picturesque spots, the start and the end of the route is easily accessible by public transport. There's a toilet at the start of the trail. We did a lot of photo stops and the whole hike including stops took us 3 hours. I did not finish my 1 liter of water."

Not too steep nor too extreme.Quite manageable even for the uninitiated.Advice:- Start early, if possible commence at 8am to avoid the sun and crowd.- If you want to contain the stress to your knees, you may want to consider use of the hiking stick- if it rained the night before, suggest to give it a skip as the clay laden track would be slippery.- bring along water to hydrate- bring a hat, sun shades for a comfortable climb/hike- take note of the blue painted spots along the way. They seem to be directional markers, quite like the modern-day Hansel & Gretel marked trailDirections:- Take a train and exit at Shau Kei Wan MTR station- Cross over to the Bus Terminus & board service # 9 towards Shek O- Alight at To Tei Wan ( you can look out at the LED display board at the front (top) of the bus- To get back to Shau Kei Wan, cross over to the other side to board service #9The views are breathtaking.Not only do you get some exercise, you are also rewarded with views of the east of Hong Kong Island.Enjoyed every minute of it."

The views were fabulous and we were definitely delighted to find this nature walk in the midst of a busy metropolitan city. This review is particularly long as the information I found prior to the walk is scant and directions not clear, so it may only be useful for people who wants to know about this magnificent walk and whether they are able to do it physically.This walk is suitable for all ages with reasonably good fitness and agility. A walking stick helps, especially if you have knees issues as there are no railings on the slopes and some steps are far apart and a bit steep. The tracks are natural paths with stones, dirt and roots. Some portions are shaded, but it's open on most on the slopes and ridges of the mountain, so sun shade and care is important. Also bring enough hydration for a 2 hours walk and maybe some snacks.There are two ways to do this trek - for the young (and young at heart with strong lungs and legs) start at To Tei Wan (\u571f\u5730\u6e7e\uff09bus stop - there is a steep climb up to the top. Immediate gratification once you clear the endless flights of natural stairs up as the views are fantastic. From then just follow the track and it winds down towards Tai Tam Gap direction. You can either take the public bus back or continue your way down to Big Wave Bay (there are directions at the break point near the portable toilet. It's a cement paved road till you reach Shek O Country park, then there are stairs down to Big Wave - if you have enough energy, follow the signs to \u5c0f\u897f\u6e7e from the park. It's a pleasant walk through shady trees and there is a road leading down to Big Wave Bay as well)Alternatively you take the more gradual way and start from Cape Collision bus stop, walk up the flight of steps beside the Tai Tam Gap Correction Facility (looks like a prison), and follow the road up. There is a public portable toilet at the beginning of the trail and take the slope up to Shek O Peak. The first 20 mins walk is on mostly flat, natural and shady trail that skirts round the slopes before reaching the stairs to Dragon's Back. Walk up the stairs and a few natural slopes, you will reach the top. Take a short break and you can walk along the undulating slopes and drink the views on a clear sunny day. Walk to the end and just follow signs down to To Tei Wan, Shek O Road to take a bus - either down to Shek O village or back to the MTR. Note that this route is good in the morning as the sun is on your back, however it's pretty demanding on your knees as the way down is long and steep. Walking down sideways helps to lessen stress on your knees.Directions : Take MTR to Shau Kei Wan stop on the blue island line and take Exit A3 to get to the bus terminus. From there, take bus no. 9. The stops are reflected on board the bus. it is a fairly regular bus, with 15 mins intervals so you can have your breakfast at the market opposite terminus. (photo of bus stops attached below) From there, you have a choice of which route (as described above) you want to do the hike on Dragon's Back.Nb - don't miss this stunning walk, we misinterpreted the signs and blogs research - and took the route to Big Wave however were lucky to meet a group of Hong Kong walkers and they lead us back to Dragon's Back. The leader of the group is 82 years old - if he can do it, so can you."

The hike was very beautiful and gave a great view of the ocean, but if you are hiking for the view, there are many others in Hong Kong that offer better ones (ex. Sunset Peak or Lions Rock). The hike is half on top of the mountain, and half completely covered by trees and dirt paths. It is not very hard so it is great for those without much hiking experience, but it can get very crowded (especially on the weekends), so if you are like me you may spend a lot of the hike being stuck behind crowds of people. However, the hike does end at Big Wave Beach, a small beach that is not very crowded located in a cute surfing town. Therefore, if you're also looking to hit the beach, this hike is a perfect way to start your day."

We started at the end that was a pretty vertical climb but took you straight to the awesome views. I think the more traditional route would be to start from the end that is mostly covered and gradual and then do the steep decent rather than climb all the steps (this might be more 'rewarding' to get the great views at the end of your journey). However, if you don't mind stairs and you're pressed for time you could always climb it, hike until the views are exhausted, and then double back down the stairs. It was a beautiful and hot summer day so bring water and some snacks. We probably crossed a total of 3 other groups our whole time out there; it was very peaceful."

Ill write my review in some detail because this attraction is a little bit out of town and can be tackled a number of ways. I'll tell you how first and then why it's so good. Believe me, it's beautiful. First, is it for you? This is not a beginners' walk. It's an intermediate walk. If you have mobility issues it will be difficult, although many elderly people give it a red hot go with some assistance from sticks, so it can be done by many, but it's not beautifully paved all the way. You will have to overcome rocks, uneven ground, there are drops of about a foot and a half, as well as steps of equal measure. It is both exposed and covered in parts which makes it hot and cool. There's a lot of clay, so weather would be a consideration if wet. There are lots of people at different levels of fitness doing this walk, but everyone was sweating and needing rest from time to time. It's not a very difficult hike, but it's not easy. You won't need hiking boots, sneakers will do, but I wore boots and I think it was better to do so if you have some. It was sunny when I went, yes I got burnt on the back of my neck. It was cloudy at the peak which limited views but every now and then the clouds cleared, also on the other side there were views because the cloud was a bit detoured by the hill itself, so it can be worth it even if a bit cloudy. The views are the best I've seen in Hong Kong. It was my favourite thing to do. Definite nature satisfaction attraction. People here have written two hours. I'd say give yourself three and go from one end to the other, more on this later. Did you know you can mountian bike here? You'd want to be an expert though, there are tight corners and steep runs and frankly too many people to get in your way. If you are hell bent on doing it fair enough, you'll need a permit though. Ok, so now if you've decided it's for you, there is the how. Directions1. Take the island line train to Chai Wan station. 2. Downstairs there are lots of buses, go there. Get the 16M bus. However we got the 16X bus because it was a public holiday and things got confusing. You could check the timetable and bus websites but it's of little importance because should there be no buses you could get a taxi it's only 5 mins drive away. 3. Have exact change for the bus or a proper octopus card. The daily tourist card is no good. $7 HK per person. So, like $1 US4. The bus winds around and takes you up a hill. You're looking for the crematorium. Our bus stop was missing due to a public holiday and the Ching Ming festival, so everyone was out and about. Here is what you will really see. A war memorial in white on the right. A Muslim graveyard on the right. A prison on top of the hill on the left. Directly opposite a big view of the graveyard and city buildings to the right. At this point you are wanting to get off. 5. When off the bus, there's a steep uphill that meets with a t intersection. Go left. You want to be on Cape collinson road. 6. The sign screams at you! It is so clear and obvious that if you are considering approaching anywhere else and trying your luck I would advise against it. It will have some portaloos, and big signs saying Hong Kong trail, Dragons back and other stuff. 7. Walk up the stairs. If you aren't sure, ask someone, I asked a police guy in English and he knew exactly what I wanted. Now you're on the path. There are a few ways through it but this is what I'd do, which isn't ezac,t how we did do it. Follow signs to the dragons back. Huff and puff sweat and swear look and see and enjoy. Now, no matter if you entered where I said or not, you can continue through to the other side. If you went the way I did, you'll find the 9 bus on the other side. Follow the signs to Shek o road. I think it was about $7 HK for the bus but I only had a $100 HK note and no change so I got a taxi instead. Taxi to Shek O Beach $40 HK and we had traffic, between two people this was ok. After a hot hike and all sweaty, and seeing the beach from the views, it's the best way to finish the hike. You can get the 9 bus back to the train station for another $7 HK. The beach has showers, change rooms, restaurants and street food. So, I like nature, I like seeing amazing views. I like the beach. I think it is so different to the city in Hong Kong that you should go to see what else Hong Kong has to offer. It makes me think of what other nature attractions there are. All up I'd say you need 3 hours to complete the hike up and down (2 for faster walkers, 1 for runners - yes, there are runners). Then add 15 mins to the beach plus 2 hours for swimming and eating. Then another 20 minutes back to the station. Get on a double decker bus and see th views again from the top. The bus stop at the beach is clear, there's a terminus sign and people everywhere. Really, it's half a day if you leave early, or the main part of your day if you leave later. Take water, nowhere to buy although I think you can refill before you go up. sunscreen, toilet paper in case you need to go bush, only portaloos at the bottom, snacks. Maybe not the bananas I compressed in my backpack. You'll need some small change for the bus. There is no entry fee to the park, none for the beach, but maybe you'll want to eat at the beach or at least want an iced tea. Transport $60 HK for the daily tourist cardBus x 2 $15 HKemergency taxi money $120 HK if you need three rides if your bus isn't running and you want to go to the beach Meals $60 each and drinks $20 each so maybe $80 HK$300 HK total to keep it easy but hopefully you won't need that $120 taxi money. So about $200 HK for lunch and most of the day out. It really was a must see, confirmed for me that there is more to do in Hong Kong, worth the effort. I hope this review helps you."

We did the walk from north to south, in the opposite direction to which most people do it. We took bus no 9 from Shau Kei Wan metro station and got out near the junction of Cape Collinson Road and Shek O Road near the Rehabilitation centre. After a steep set of stairs we commenced the walk. The first 2km are a flat trail and easy walking and offer nice views over Tai Tam Harbour. We ascended a natural staircase which got us to the top plateau of the walk which forms the Dragons Back. From here were excellent views although it was very windy down to Big Wave Bay and Shek O. It was a well formed track and the whole walk took us about 2 hours. There were growing numbers of crowds on the walk so it is best to do it early. The number 9 bus has a stop at the end of the walk."

Fantastic experience, I loved every minute of it.I was in HK for just over a week and this is how my girlfriend and I spent our last day (I had a lot of persuading to do).We did the trek the opposite way. Get the MTR to Chai Wan and take a walk to the graveyard, trek up a lot of steep steps and follow the signs.The Dragon's Back is part of the Hong Kong trail! It goes on for over 50km so be sure once you reach Shek-O road grab a bus or taxi. We stupidly kept walking towards a beach and ended up putting an extra 2 hours on our walk back.A taxi back to our hotel in Wanchai was around 120HKD which was fantastic.My girlfriend and I are not experienced at hiking. I thought the toughest challenge was going up the steps in the beginning. The rest was ok!Some spectacular views from the top even if it's cloudy! :)To check out my photos of Dragon's back have a look on my instagram page: __fightoffyourdemons"

            "review": "Alternate Route. Most people walk south to north taking the No. 9 bus from Shau Kei Wan to To Tei Wan village...alternatively you could start the hike at Chai Wan MTR Station by climbing the stairs in Cape Collision Cemetery. It's about a 500 step climb and more strenuous than the normal hike. Passing through the cemetery is a different experience. When you reach the end of the trail at To Tei Wan village, I'd recommend catching the No. 9 bus to Shek O instead of heading back to Shau Kei Wan. You can \"hike\" out to an island off Shek O or grab a beer along the beach depending upon the day / time of year. Doing in the hike this way takes about three - four hours from the MTR Station to the Bus Stop.As for the hike, it's Interesting although I thought the views from the top would have been a little better and shown more islands. There's a hike that goes from Discovery Bay to Mui Wo where at the peak you have much better views of Kowloon, Hong Kong, Lamma, Cheung Chau, etc. Even if it's sunny, it may not be clear and you'll barely be able to make out Lamma Island or Stanley Peninsula. The best views are of Big Wave Beach and Shek O."

There were some nice views of the coast and the like and it was nice to take the extended walk through to Big Way Bay, but there are better places to go if you want to have some outdoors time. Be prepared for a lot of people who may not share your walking speed."

Despite tons of sunscreen and hats, we all got mildly sunburned. This isn't a trail with lots of tall trees and shade, so be prepared for tons of sun!All in all, definitely worth checking out!

            "review": "A different view of Hong Kong. This hike was on my to-do list when planning my most recent Hong Kong trip. TA reviews were a great help, but I also consulted the concierges at the 2 hotels I stayed at. Interestingly, the Mandarin Oriental recommended the hike in one direction, starting at Cape Collinson and ending at To Tei Wan, while the Four Seasons advised the opposite direction, as does the Hong Kong Tourism Board's \"The Inside Guide to Hikes and Walks in Hong Kong\".I ended up doing the hike the Four Seasons' way for the following reasons: 1) Shek O Peak, the highest point, is nearer to the To Tei Wan start, so you're doing the hardest part of the hike first. 2) At Cape Collinson, you have the choice of ending your hike here or turning right and continuing past Pottinger Gap down to Big Wave Bay Beach, which is what I did.As prior TA reviews and everyone has said, you can access the trail by taking the MTR to Shau Kei Wan, crossing the street to the SKW Bus Terminus and taking Bus 9 (\"Shek O\") to the To Tei Wan stop along Shek O Road. I did this hike on a Sunday morning and was off to a late start, so I ended up taking a taxi to To Tei Wan (trying to avoid the inevitable weekend crowds). The taxi cost $123 HKD. There are 2 porta-potties at both ends of the trail--the flushing feature did not work in either of the ones I used. And bring your own tissues just in case. Plus bring water and a jacket in winter, and possibly sunglasses and a hat. It gets very windy on the crest in the winter.From this end, the trail immediately goes up, up, up. Steep parts of the trail can have paved stairs, rock stairs, dirt stairs framed in wood, just rocks, or just dirt. First you see views west of Tai Tam Bay and Harbour, then you see views east of Shek O Beach, Village and Golf Course. Then you see Big Wave Bay and Beach. Again, it was very windy this time of year. After the peak, it's mostly downhill (but a few uphills) until you merge with the Hong Kong trail section of the hike. This is a mostly flat, lower-level trail through woodland, crossing a few small streams, only one of which had water this time of year. The trail was PACKED with an almost continuous line of people of all sorts going the other direction, some talking VERY LOUDLY in Cantonese. About 2 hours had passed by the time I reached the fork at Cape Collinson. From here, I turned right, following the signs to Big Wave Beach, following a pave road to Pottinger Gap (there's a small park here, but no restrooms), then down a mostly all rocks trail to Tai Long Wan Village and Big Wave Bay Beach (about 45 min.). The village is small, all-white, with several shops selling snacks and rental surf equipment and wetsuits. There's a nice park and playground, with good restrooms. Then I caught first site of a new type of human for me--the Chinese surfer. There were lots of Caucasian/expat surfers as well. But the Chinese ones--it was like I was in Hawaii!--so different from the frenzied all-business Chinese running around Central, smartphones in hand. The beach itself is small and rather narrow, but with decent-sized waves breaking very close to shore. Along one side is a snack shop with a viewing deck and tables. An area with stone barbecues is on the other side, with restrooms and showers at the rear. There is an ancient rock carving near the barbecues. Someone was flying a drone over everyone. From the parking area here, you can catch the 9 bus again, but not on Sundays. A mini-bus that holds 16 passengers takes you back to the MTR station for $10 HKD. This is what I did, but after a little confusion. There is no specific time to pay--some paid when they got on, others when they got off--the driver somehow remembers faces and if you paid. Also, an English-speaking passenger confirmed the bus went to Shau Kei Wan, and pointed out the station entrance once there. Alternatively, you can walk along Big Wave Beach Road and then Shek O Road past the golf course into Shek O Village and Beach. There are apparently some nice restaurants there, as well as a bus 9 stop. Shek O Road is a narrow, winding mountain road with narrow shoulders. Many people were walking along these shoulders, single-file, while cars and especially buses nearly clipped them.This is a nice hike to do, at least once. I'm not the fittest person, so the uphill hike was rather strenuous for me, but some athletes were running up the hills. I laugh at the TA reviewers who call the hike easy or leisurely. Certainly a nice look at a different side of Hong Kong, with nice views and beaches to boot."

The Dragon's Back is in the middle of a foot trail, which stretches from the right foot of the frog-shaped Hong Kong Island to around the middle part of the East side of the Island, is one of the most pleasant and scenic hikes in Hong Kong.The trail starts at Shek O Road, just off To Tei Wan (a bay). Aftering a gentle climb, you will get on top of the ridge of a hill which runs all the way northward along the small peninsula which forms the right foot of the Hong Kong Island. It is the ridge which gives the name 'Dragon's Back'. Once on top, you can have, on the left side, a very good look of the other foot of the Hong Kong Island where the Red Hill Peninsula. On the right side, you can have a bird eyes' view of the beautiful Shek O beach and the lush green golf course adjacent to the it. The plaque in the picture above tells you which is which when you look out from the Dragon's Back. Further on, you will have the opportunity to have a good look of the Big Wave Bay which is reputedly to be best place for surfing in Hong Kong. You can deduce the reason from its name. At about two-third of its length and two hours into the journey (if you walk leisurely), you will arrive at Cape Collison, where the trail takes a right turn and begin its descend into Big Wave Bay. You can exit here if you want to end the hike early. If you continue and embark on the downhill path, you will arrive at the scenic Big Wave Bay in about half an hour. It is much smaller than Shek O Beach and has much less swimmers (because of the big waves), but it is a tranquil and clean little one with fresh air blowing in form the East straight from the Pacific Ocean.There are a few eateries there where you can have some snacks or a cup of coffee on the beach. While there, you may take the opportunity to examine the stone carving on the rock surface on left hand side of the beach. It is believed that the carving might have been done about 3,000 years ago in an effort to calm the rough sea just outside the bay and to ensure good catches from the water!Transportation is easy. For the start, takes the No. 9 bus from Shaukiwan to To Tei Wan (just watch out for the name of the stop name (\"To Tei Wan\") displayed before each stop). For the return, you can either hop onto a red public light bus which will take you back to Shakiwan for about HK$10, or you can take the No. 9 bus to Shek O, before taking it again on its return journey to Shaukiwan. Just one last word of caution. Shade is limited on the ridge. So avoid hot summer day and be sure take your sun-glasses, hat and plenty of fluid with you for the trail. You will not be able to find any food kiosks or drink vendors until you reach Big Water Bay."

If you don't have an Octopus card, the cost of the bus is HK$7 - be sure to have the correct fare as no change is given. Almost everyone will get off the bus at the same time, so don't fret about not knowing where to get off. Bring plenty of water and wear good hiking shoes."

It was a bit tough to navigate, but very rewarding. It's easy to travel by MTR and bus, and there's a 10 HKD shuttle from Big Wave Bay to Shau Kei Wan MTR station, so you don't have to worry about returning if you continue the hike. I would recommend bringing snacks along if you want to rest at the multiple picnic stations when you get down from Dragon's Back Peak."

Mostly because they either come for shopping in HK and / or visit the usual places like Disney Lang and Ocean Park. There have been some of my friends who have visited HK couple of times and still ask me \"is this in HK?\" However, you really need to do some homework before visiting this place like, charting the transport plan (if not travelling by taxi/car, the time to visit and atleast 1 litre of water per person. Please bear in mind that you need to be in decent fitness for this as this is almost 5 kms of trek. From my opinion, the best time to start the trek is at 3:30 PM (if you are in HK island and travelling by MRT, it will take atleast 40 mins to reach here, check different sites for exact direction). You can start the trek from a small Bus Stop (be careful to watch this bus stop if travelling by bus, as it is very easy to miss out). At 3:30PM, you are shielded by the dense foliage till you reach the top. At the top you are greeted by awesome views on both side of the bays. At top the trek is flat and long, since you walk along the mountain ridge with gradual inclination, hence the name Dragon's back. On the way down, if you are just after the monsoon or rainy season, you will be greeted by rushing small waterfalls. It is quite refreshing to splash water on you. I was advised NOT to drink the water, hence be careful not to give in the temptation. Towards the end of the trek, the path has sharp stones becomes heavily enveloped by foliage cutting off much of the sunlight. Hence, make sure you are wearing good athletic shoes and have a small torch just in case you are delayed and are still trekking down by 6:30 PM as it gets quite dark due to the dense foliage. You end the trek by entering a small community next to the beach. There are couple of restaurants opened till I think 7:30 PM and you can have water / soft drinks and even it of the meal. The Beach itself is more of a creek and hence has good sand. This is quite welcome after a hard 2 - 3 hours of trekking.If you are adrenalin junkie, this is quite an experience on a Dragon's back."

To head back to Shau Kei Wan, just take the bus on the opposite side (else, if you want to explore the beach and its surrounding area (good laidback option), just continue in the same direction of the bus journey from SKW to the bus terminus).Went there in Dec and the weather was cool, dry and perfect.

However all said and done it is a wonderful, worthwhile walk. I started at about 8:30 and did not encounter anyone until the end (about 10:30) when the weather had fined up.It offers great views and a wonderful sense of Hong Kong's natural bushland interspersed with views of Stanley and other urban enclaves. I was a little started at one point when I heard the grunt of a feral pig close to the track, but hey, this gave me something to talk about!I would do this again!"

After a short ride we reached the start of the steps up to the Dragon's Back. I am 55 years old with a bad knee following an unsucessful cartilage operation. I'm also pretty unfit. Sensible shoes are a must, there are countless steps and the occasional tricky rocky slopes but, as I say, although not in peak condition, I was fine. We stopped several times to allow me to catch my breath and to take pics. After the rocky climb and dreaded subsequent knee-aching descent, there was a relatively flat 30 minute stroll through shaded woods before we turned right to walk to the Big Wave Beach, in Shek O. This started as an easy stroll along a road before turning down a rocky descent, with some more of the dreaded steps. (My knee only took a couple of days to recover). It took us just under two and a half hours to complete the walk from the bus stop to the beach, where we stopped at the westernised Eric's Kitchen for a welcome snack. The mini-buses from here back to the MTR station run every 15 minutes and cost $10. This was an easy, inexpensive, healthy and beautiful half day adventure, away from the bustle of the city. Amazing views and a welcome breeze at the top."

There were plenty of rest stops along the way for enjoying the views. I can't believe it has taken me 35 years to get around to doing this hike. I have heard so much about it. Not to be missed!"

I love hiking, so it was a bit short, but the scenery is very nice.I walked quite a bit faster then anyone else though. As a single walker and not taking pictures every turn.It wasn't to busy on a week day, but there are some \"louder\" groups every once and a while.But it just passed them quickly and as soon as I went around a corner, I had the trail for my self again.The first part has quite some incline to the top of the dragon's back. Lot's of steps. But after that it is mostly downhill and you can cruise it down to the beach. The beach was nice, get in the water and feel far away from the hustle & bustle from the cramped city.Thoroughly enjoyed my self. Recommend the trail to anyone except the very unfit.Tips: Bring food/drinks and correct clothing/shoes. Weather can always change rapidly and expose you to the elements. Even on a \"Sunny\" day bring a jacket for protection."

I have seen people wearing sandals on the trail, however do wear sports shoes to fully enjoy this. The trail starts in the woods, but then opens up, following the crest of the mountain (hence the Dragon's Back). On a clear day the view is truly spectacular over the water.Distance 5km.start: right after Cape Collinson Road, at the Lai Chi Rehabilitation Centerend: Shek O road,take a bus to Shek Otime: anywhere from 45 minutes running/fast pace, to 1+ hourselevation gain 178 metersIf you do this hike in the morning, you can get to Shek O beach in time to eat Thai food at one of the establishments at the start of the village, and then rent a sun umbrella and deck chairs to relax."

Carry a backpack with bottled water. Leave your hands free in case you need them to help you along the steeper slopes. Thankfully there were clear skies that morning I was there so the view was really good at the top. Small nuggets of info: Before boarding #9, I saw a traditional market just across the road. This was my third trip to HK but I have never been to a traditional market. It was small but it had most things one would need for a home cooked meal. I bought oranges from a vendor, 3 of 4 were quite sweet and juicy. By chance, while waiting for the bus back, I decided to take a look around and spotted one of Hong Kong's well-known cemeteries with very neat rows and rows of tombstones. Moving."

If you guys want to see the view in Dragon Back in a different way, it's highly recommend to try on flying there to look at the sea and view from the sky in different view! Haha! Very very nice! After landing the flight, you could walk the path down to catch the bus to go to Shek O for dinner or go back to town for something nice to eat!More information for flying experience, please see www.x-flyhongkong.com and people can do booking with the pilot there!"

Once you make it to Big Wave Bay there are some decent toilets there. Also look out for the shuttle minibus that leaves from the car park on the way out. It costs an extra 100 each but will take you straight to the MTR. If you prefer to catch the no 9 back, you don't have to walk all the way to Shek O.

There were also sign posts to show you where to proceed. Weather was fine and highly recommend to go in Late october or November where the weather will be much cooler. Once we were at the top and started our descend, came the wrong decision. After you follow the route and descend, you will come to T-Junction. If you turn left, you go to Shek-O, if you turn right, you will head to Tai Tam Gap. Please remember to take the Tai Tam Gap. The Shek-O route, which we took, willl bring you back to To Tei Wan starting point. However, the main problem was that the Shek-O route I believe is less travelled, so the vegetation can be quite dense at certain parts. It was a good 2 hours walk which did help us burn off some fat from all the eating we did.Note: Please bring plenty of water as there are no shops to burn anything nearby."

I didn't really plan all that much in going (and not expecting much), so in my last day at HK, I decided to take some time off by myself and decided to hike up Dragon's Back - it did not disappoint!To get there, I would suggest taking the MTR to Shau Kei Wan Station => Exit A3 => take bus 9 from Shau Kei Wan bus terminus to To Tei Wan on Shek O Road. Once there, you just follow the path to Dragon's Back. From there, you can take the path and loop all the way to Big Wave Bay.Unfortunately, there isn't much to do once you get there (if you are not much of a surfer or swimmer like me). From here, you can actually take the bus back to Shau Kei Wan Station. You just need to walk a little down the path down the surfer rentals. If all else, you can ask the locals for directions! This website helped me A LOT:http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/see-do/great-outdoors/hikes/dragons-back-hiking-tour.jspTips: 1.) Bring at least 2 water bottles 2.) Get enough sun screen! 3.) Bring boots 4.) Be prepared to hike for about 3 hours 5.) The first half has a couple of rocky trails followed by gradual descent in the middle. The last half has some rocky parts so that's where your boots come in handy. 6.) I met a lot of elderly people with walking sticks, so if you have bad knees, bring those!All in all, a great place to go to when you want some time alone from busy HK Island. The bus ride up and down Shek O is enough for the trip to Dragon's Back!"

The path is steep in parts however easily walkable being well laid out and easy to follow - only one place where we needed to decide whether a right or left turn was needed to complete our planned route to Big Wave Bay beach. Recommend early start in the warmer months before it gets too hot. Although there were some very fit runners who passed us at almost full tilt most people we met were taking in the view nice and easy.Makes a good half day excursion with some time spent at the beach swimming and relaxing afterwards."

Double decker bus so not too queasy a journey. This time, after the ridge, we went toward Tai Tam Gap then down to Big Wave Bay where a shuttle bus (HKD10 cash, no Octopus card) took us back to the MTR station. Please note that the walk does not get any easier on the way down. There are a few stone steps but many many tree roots and uneven slopes. You need to be vigilant, especially when you are tired or you can easily hurt yourself. If you have a choice, try and do this on a week day and wear swimmers under your clothes so you can chill at Big Wave Bay at the end. Very very crowded at the weekends....."

It's got everything right: gorgeous view over the stretch of islands, surfing beach, well-maintained track for both mountain biking and hiking.Close to town and there's public transport to and from the starting/ending points.I had a great time here in my last morning in Hk. On the way you will bump into fellow hikers - majority is local who's really very friendly. Feel free to talk to them or enjoy their Canto songs at the resting areas along the way.Do pack swim suits if you wanna surf or chill at the beach at the end of the track. A bit more crowded here with families and surfers. But the waves are quite strong as the name suggests.My route: Shau Kei Wan MRT - Bus 9 to To Tei Wan Village - Shek O Peak - Big Wave Bay -"

If you have the impression that Hong Kong is all skyscrapers, overcrowded streets and air pollution, this walk in Shek O Country Park will definitely change your perception. Alongside the many other green spaces in the city, this offers dramatic landscapes, amazing views, fresh air and peaceful escapism \u2013 in fact, there was rarely another person in sight in the few hours I spent here.Needs a bit of initiative to find the start of the trail which is hidden away near a bus stop on the road over to Shek O from Shau Kei Wan MTR, but it\u2019s well worth spending a half day here to break away from the hustle and bustle."

It is a nice walk through the mountains with a nice view of both sides of the peninsula which finishes at an organized beach where you can take dive in the ocean, do a bit of surfing and have some food. I did the Hong Kong rail from Skek O' road to Big Wave Bay. It took me around 2.5 hours one way in a really hot day and the first few hundred meters are uphill so I definitely recommend plenty of water (1.5-2 litres), sunglasses, hat and a change of clothes. The hike is not too steep or dangerous of any kind but requires a decent level of fitness and a few stops. I got a taxi from HK island to Shek O' road where the hike starts and costed about 120HK $. As soon as I reached the Big Wave bay I got a public bus back to the MTR (Shau Kei Wan) and costed 12 HK $"

However I must be one of the only people to have actually not made it to Big wave bay!! My partner and I reached the peak and experienced the beautiful views along the way. We then took a wrong turn (as we didn't do much research) when we arrived at a T-intersection point in the track shortly after on the way down. I got excited and took the direction of 'shek O' rather than continuing to big wave bay. This took us back to where we started which I suppose is an option if you don't want to do the whole trail. I am definitely going back to complete the whole hike."

The green bus can be found opposite the bus terminal at MTR Shau Kei Wan exit A3. You can also choose to ride bus #9 at the bus terminal. The destination is Shek O.To take mini green bus, you need to know the exact location to stop at To Tei Wan as you need to alert the driver before the destination. I am first time going there, the bus driver is very helpful. He showed me the landmark and stopped for me the bus stop at To Tei Wan. The bus fare is HKD7 one way.The trail starts right beside the bus stop and you definitely won't miss it. Although the trail is steep incline and decline, it is not difficult to hike. Bring along drinking water to hydrate yourself and light refreshment to fill your hunger as it doesn't have any water replenish station until you reach Big Wave Bay. You have great sea view when you reach the peak."

With four persons in the taxi and the meter stopping at HKD 134, that was a good start to the hike.The hike starts off quite steep to the top of the trail and then flattens out before heading down to the end point at Big Wave Bay. All in all 8K, but it took us almost 2.5 hours and we are all quite fit runners. What makes it take time is the pounding sun and the climbing, but it certainly is worth all the effort, because you have a grand view of almost all of the southern coast of Hong Kong island thoughout most of the hike and then, suddenly when you turn a corner, the scene changes and you see the easternmost parts in Chai Wan. At the end of the hike, there's a rewarding beer or ice cream waiting for you in one of the bars at Big Wave Bay. Getting back from Big Wave Bay, we caught another taxi, but we could just as well have hopped onto one of the shuttle buses back to the city.All in all a great hike, but remember to put on sun screen and take along plenty of water. We had about 2l each and I would not recommend less."

Tried the Dragon Back's trail for first time, using below link information from discovery HK:http://www.discoverhongkong.com/common/images/see-do/great-outdoors/maps/map-03-dragon-back.pdfSome info to share:From Shau Kei Wan MTR Station, Take exit Shau Kei Wan Station Exit A2Walked to Shau Kei Wan Bus Terminus. Took bus No.9 towards Shek O. Bus No.9 stand is probably nearer to the other end of the Terminus. Dropped at Shek O Road near To Tei Wan Village. One can take note of the LED showing the next station on the bus or use smartphone GPS to be sure if required.Top up enough water or food (if required) in Shau Kei Wan before taking No.9.Hiked from near To Tei Wan Village via Shek O Peak to Dragon Back to Big Wave Beach took about 3++ hours. Normal walking pace. Mainly paved trails with clear trail directions along the way. Would say 60-70% of the trail probably is \"inside\" the forestry while te remaining would be clear views.IMHO, outstanding views of HK sea-line and scenery. The beaches at Big Wave and Shek O were also decent, ok clean, and nice sea scenery.Bring and wear light in the summer with lots of water.From Big Wave beach took no.9 to Shek O bus terminus (a small old bus stop) 5-10 mins journey and take the return trip on same bus number to Shau Kei Wan. Maybe around 30 mins trip for this. Went on a weekday, the bus trips and hike weren't crowded. But very hot July dayGood short hike for sporty visitors who like to sweat. Not as tough as Lantau Trail if any comparison needed. OK for grown ups and teenagers with normal fitness/ health. IMHO.Thanks."

Reviewers here may not have all taken the same trail.The trailheads are all serviced by the #9 bus or by minibuses that will take you to places like Big Wave beach. Another option is to go through the cemetery near Chai Wan station. So you can set out from anywhere, to anywhere, and feel confident you can get public transportation out. Bus fares are HKD 7 - 10 each way. Minibus drivers will make change; big bus drivers need the exact (you can round up) fare in coins. There are good signs on the trails in Chinese and English. Toilet facilities are available at trailheads.The #9 bus from Sai Wan Ho is an experience in itself. Try to sit upstairs so you can watch the twisty roads carved through rocks. Popular stops are at Lan Nai Wan (for a short hike to the peak) and Hong Kong Trail sec. 8 (next after Lan Nai Wan, to traverse the ridge). Fare is HKD 6.90 in 2014.The trail is quite easy, though slippery when wet. There are stairs on rises, and it's frequently carved in to the hillside. Trainers/sneakers are fine. I gained the ridge in only 15 minutes at a moderate pace, but I continued all the way along the ridge and over to Big Wave Beach at a fast pace in under 2 hours. The trail is mostly shady, except along the ridge. Views are very good on clear days. Bring lots of water, and avoid the middle of the day! I took along swimming trunks and a towel to cool off at Big Wave.Highly recommended for hikers of all abilities."

Views are stunning, visit when the weather is cooler and conducive for hiking. I just went in the middle of August/Summer/blazing heat so not a good idea but oh well. Watch out for the terrain, while not exactly mountaineering, there are some parts of the path that I would not bring young children to hike. Try starting from the South and ending off at Big Wave Beach, after a hike as strenuous as that, the beach is a very welcome respite."

The trek is approx 8km long and took us (novice hikers) around 3 hours to complete at a reasonable walking speed. The first part of the Dragon's back is the hardest up to Shek O peak as it is a hard steep climb with very little shade. We did this trek in 35 degree heat and considerable humidity! So this was all a factor into the speed we could physically walk. The views over the Stanley Peninsula are wonderful and you can see for miles around. Very much worth it!Once over the steep climbs it levels off and is shaded for a good portion to help you recover from the climb.I cannot stress the importance of carrying water and snacks with you - you will be out there for 2-3 hours and there are no refreshments available until the very end. Go prepared else you run the serious risk of heatstroke especially with it being so exposed. We carried over 3L of water and drank it all! There are toilets at the beginning and middle of the trail and helpful markers point out how far you have come. Ending up at Big Wave Bay was a bonus - recommend carrying beach gear with you as relaxing there with an ice cream following your achievement is worth it! I would also recommend a change of clothes - you will be soaked by the end of the trek and there are showers on the beach so a change of clothes is welcomed! Go out and do it, the more prepared you are the more you will enjoy it! Do not be put off, we managed it and if we can, anyone can!!"

We took a lot of pictures. Got their on the #9 bus for about 1 dollar US and same for return. Hard part of walk was in the beginning up the steep hill to the beginning of the trail. Then trail goes up but easily. Now you come to a couple of harder area but man made steps. At this point you are high so breathing is a little harder. No where to get water so bring plenty with you. Enjoy the view and take your time. Remember a sweat rag and camera and enjoy the journey. Going down the other side is a lot of steps and easy. A beer station at the top would have been great but this is BYOB."

This should be high on the list for any visitor to Hong Kong - and the more people who do it, the more likely it'll remain a pristine wilderness! Easy to get to the starting point by bus or taxi and then a nice few hours of well-marked trails and delightful views all the way to Big Wave Bay for a swim (reasonable waves though the water is a little murky - may be that the coliform count was high when I was there?) Good food options at Big Wave Bay. Overall, a fantastic & accessible walk and entirely unexpected if you have the usual understanding of Hong Kong as a real-life version of Blade Runner."

The hike in total was about 8KM and was vertical with steps for about the first 2 kilometers and then leveled out after the Dragon's Back section.The best part of this hike was the Dragon's Back section which had great views of Stanley Peninsula, Shek O and the rest of Hong Kong island. If I were to do it again, I would finish the hike after the Dragon's Back section or bring my swimsuit and swim in Big Wave Bay and Shek O after the hike. Shek O also looked interesting, but I didn't stick around this time."

The mountain and ocean views are great and it's nice to be away from the crowds. A clear day in January is terrific - take a jacket. A clear day in June is likely to be very warm, so take water and pace yourself on the steps. To get there: MTR to Shau Kei Wan Station, look for Exit A3 and take bus 9 from Shau Kei Wan bus terminus to To Tei Wan on Shekou Road. The bus is easy to find and an electronic sign inside will tell you when you reach the right stop. There's a porto potty at the start of the trail and at the end. Basic, but usable.The full hike is about 4 km if you start at To Tei Wan. This takes you up to and along the ridge and back down to another point on Shekou Road. From there, you can hail a taxi or hike another 2.5 km to the seaside village of Shekou. Just follow the signs. Have a libation in Shekou by the beach or catch a bus or taxi to Stanley, a great place for lunch al fresco.Enjoy."

I read many articles on how to get here and it was confusing with various accounts. A below reviewer mentioned that route via the last MTR Chai Wan stop was confusing and the hike up tje 300 steps path up the cemetery requiring much effort. Here s an account of my journey.1, Took MTR to Shau Kei Wan, went to main bus terminal and asked for directions and was directed to a double decker bus no 9, Caught the bus and got assistance from the bus driver whom stopped us at 6 or 7th bus stop at trail head atTo Tei Wan where there is a sign[post to points to trial. Time to hike up 1km uphill was indicated 1 hr and if you are fit you can cut down that time top 35 mins walking without need to rest. Note walking 1 km up requires more time and effort than on flat terrainPast the small bamboo forest and 15 mins up, you start to get good views, If you emjoy flora the camellias and bushes along the way and watch out for butterfliesIt can take less than an hour to get up to Shek O peak where you will be rewarded with a great view of the Shek O Bay & Tai long Wan /beaches and the surroundings (view golf course, condos and a massive bungalows, mountains and blue seas but grey skies.From the Shek O peak, it would a longer walk to 2-3 km to Tai Long Wan so we opted for a shorter hike back via Tai Tam Wan trail to bus stop, passing by a small waterfall (rocky path n be careful on wet days) and reaching the Correction centre at end of trial. Caught the mini bus A (pay cash) which stops opposite the Shau Kei Wan wet market. Visit it if you got the time.Good 2 + hours hike (not stroll) and if you are not a regular hiker, take it easy. Don't forget to bring a litre of water, some chocs/energy booster, wear a cap or carry an umbrella in case it rains or avoid a heat stroke if you are hiking on a hot cloudless day.If youcan DIY you can join a 4 hr tour *HK$500 ?). There were few people on the morning of my hike as it was rainy and I started early at 730am. Be forewarned, there are no toilets up along the way ! How long it takes depends entirely on your as you need not double back but opt out for another trail (shorter one back via Tai Tam Wan). Local hikers could give us more tips"

First one is faced with 100's (really, we counted, but lost track gasping for breath). I think the site I originally read said 300 stairs - believe me there were many more than that. Additionally it's not easy to find the trail - just know that you need to keep climbing the steps to the very top in order to find the trail. That being said, we started the hike pretty proud of our step climbing ability. However, we soon found that we had no idea where we were walking. We tried following signs, but invariably took wrong turns. Eventually we got on the right track and saw beautiful views and had great experiences and challenges. At some points the trail was extremely rocky and narrow, crossing tiny little creeks. Most of the time we were not sure how we would ever find and end point with any sort of transportation. We did what most people along the way did - asked people who were walking from the direction we were going and usually got pointed in the right direction. It was a wonderful hike, and we did reach a \"correct\" end point where the bus was available. Lovely, fun and challenging. Very nice people on the trails - Asian and Caucasian alike - everyone was helpful."

Nevertheless, the effort, even with my fear of heights, is well worth it. The climb up the first hour or so can be monotonous & tiring. Butterflies flutter around & trail you. Nearer the Dragon's Back is where the breathtaking views begin. Stay on the path between the bushes although the slopes do not seem steep on both sides. It rained the day before but the sun had dried the ground. Hold on to your cap for the wind is very strong up there. Light snacks may not be sufficient for the whole trail. Having said that, pack as light as possible. I regretted not capturing the views with a video. The views coupled with the sound of wind culminates the whole experience. After Dragon's Back, the hike seemed easier but the views disappear. Just be prepared to wet your shoes as you pass through countless refreshing waterfalls. We were lucky to have met 2 native hikers who guided us through the waterfalls swiftly. Having a trail map also proved handy as the directions are posted with names of roads. Only the last 2 signs gave directions to Big Wave Bay Beach.After Tai Tam Road, the downward hike is on a road surface. After Cape Collinson, the downward hike turns back into a forested area with boulders. You will hit Tai Long Wan Village. That's where Big Wave Bay Beach is located. The beach is as awesome as the peak. We didn't use the restroom there as it seemed disused. Instead, we opted to lunch & use the facilities at one of the eating places there. Meet fellow hikers of different nationalities who trek alone or in groups. Single female hikers are as many male hikers. We took many rest stops along the way as suggested by other reviewers. All in, my 10 & 13 year old boys with my husband & I took a total of 4 hours to complete the trek. Experience of a lifetime for us!"

The tourist website says it takes 6 hours from To Tei Wan to big wave bay but it only took us 3 so can be done nicely in a morning / afternoon. If you're with kids or less mobile and if you decide to picnic on top then of course would take longer of course. The first part up to the top if te dragon's ack is great with lots of nice views. The second part down to big wave bay is mostly in the trees so no great views but still fine. Big wave bay is fine. Not the most attractive town but the beach is nice. We went on a Saturday afternoon so was pretty busy with horrible tannoy announcements but imagine its nicer during the week. Food didn't look good anywhere to be honest so we didn't bother (the water safety/e-coli rating for the bay on the side of the restaurant dulled our appetites a little too!); we just had a beer and watched the surf before heading back to the MTR (there was a public minibus in th car park back to the station which was handy). Remember there are no shops on the walk after the MTR station until you get to big wave bay so bring water and any snacks you might need with you."

I headed off on the MTR to Chai Wan, the last stop on the line. From there I walked up through the cemetery. It was quite enjoyable at 7am and worth a look. I went straight up through the top of the cemetery and found the staircase taking me up to the start of Dragons Back.It was a beautiful day and although a little Hong Kong hazy, there were still great views to be had. I also walked the next section and although not as picturesque, it was beautiful being out on my own. I only saw 3 people on the next leg.

We certainly needed the water we carried with us. The day we undertook the walk was during the recent 'Thunderstorm' weather in HK. On the day we went the forecast was for sunshine. It was sunny for the large part of the walk, it was also very humid, probably too hot. However, the effort was worth it, and the need to ease up at times during the walk meant that we took our time and enjoyed the spectacular views. Both of us are retired and in our mid 60s, but still managed the walk which is in parts quite steep. If you have the time and are prepared to move outside of the air-conditioned tour bus, this is an activity that will reward you with the opportunity to see yet another side of the beauty evident on HK Island. We finished our journey at Big Wave Bay with the intentions of a cooling down dip to end the day. That was not necessary as about a mile from the end we were completely soaked by a sudden outburst of 'monsoon' type rain which lasted about 20 mins. It didn't dampen our spirits as we sat in the beach cafe at Deep Water and enjoyed a drink and the scenery. A good day out."

Now after having been to the Dragon's Back, I am convinced that Hong Kong has its beauty in nature, too. The trees are wild and one can see the beaches, islands and clear waters. Hong Kong is no longer a tiny island, but its suburbs add lengths and breadths to its size."

I took the route given by some HK experts and also detailed in Serious Hiker's Guide to Hong Kong by Pete Spurrier Hong Kong Trail Stage 8 - Tai Long WanI think it covers 10km or so in 3 hours+ today with lunch at Shek O Thai restaurant at the roundabout just a little after the bus terminus. The temperature was around 27% with some sun and humid. I had 1.5L water but only drank about 1L, might need more if the weather is warmer.MTR to Shau Kei Wan and then bus #9 (at the furthest end of terminal), I saw the signal board in the bus show To Tei Wan Village and pressed the bell to drop. You can try telling the driver and he should be able to help you too if you need. I took pictures of the bus stop and the sight of the view opposite the bus top facing Tai Tam Bay. The stairs is on the left after you dropped with toilet facilities (not very clean type). - some said it was stop #12 but I think very hard to keep the count as the bus does not stop at every stop.Make sure you have enough water so there is really NO replenishment till Big Wave Bay. The parts to the peak is up and up, so take it slowly. I went with hiking boots, one walking stick and wide brim hat. I would strongly recommend that especially if you are going all the way to Big Wave Bay. There was a red storm alert last night and there were plenty of water in the streams and some parts are more rocky and less well defined (although very small parts).The route is well signed and you are unlikely to get lost. I was alone and did fine given it was my first time hiking alone in HK. I only saw 3 people, 2 runners, 1 walker/hiker - it was Monday late morning afterall. The first signage show picnic area which gives a better view of Tai Tam Bay but you get even better view later so no need to detour there. Just keep following the signs to Dragon Back. My first distance post was H085 (you get them every 500m) and the last one was H100 before enter Big Wave Bay village.After reaching the peak, continuing on will bring you across several streams/fall which are manageable - tracking shoes will get wet for sure (not sure it was due to the rain the previous night). The path from the water tank to Big Wave Bay is paved for quite some distance, passing the cemetry on the left (you need to peek through the trees to see it). The final leg to the Big Wave Bay is back on hiking tracks which is still ok. Just follow the signs to the beach where the waves did not seem big at all. I headed for Shek O (you can have lunch at the village if you like) - which is almost 2km away. There is a bus stop for #9 at the entrance to the village if you like to take bus back to MTR. Check the bus schedule, not sure it comes every 20min or only once an hour. I did see (or actually miss one). Anyway walk and keep left all the way - the country club with golf course is on the left, you will reach Shek O where there is a beach too. There are more people and foreigners in Shek O and seemed to be living there.Take the minibus or #9 back to MTR station. I took minibus back for Hk$7 - the last stop. Recommended only if you like to hike and would enjoy seeing HK from such places.I enjoyed it certainly"

My friends persuaded me to go hiking; luring me in with the promise of an amazing lunch afterwards as a reward. When it comes to food, how was I to say no! 2.5 hours later... we finally got to the top. I admit I was the straggler, I was the complainer, walking at a 90 degree angle up the mountain. I basically looked like the hunch-back of Notre Dame. However, after making the journey up those notorious steps, sucking on candy to get my sugar level up, downing at least a liter of water and after several tantrums.... We finally made it! and the view was BREATHTAKING!!!! I would do it all over again just to see that view.I wouldn't be surprised if my friends never invite me to go hiking again, but i am sure glad I made it to the top and even took a celebratory photo with the plaque.If you a traveling to HK, this is one place you NEED to experience. Its a world away from the hustle and bustle of Central and Mong Kok."

The Dragon's Back trail is Stage 8, and the final stage, of the 50 km Hong Kong Trail that runs from the Peak to Big Wave Bay. The Dragon's Back stage of the trail offers spectacular views in all directions, is well maintained and is approximately 8.5 km in length. The final 2.5 km are on concrete, and the rest of the path is compacted dirt and rock. There are patches along the way that are slippery when wet. This is an easy hike for anyone used to hiking.There are many terrific view points once the ridge is attained. Still on Hong Kong Island, and only minutes from the urban core, the greenery and scenery on the Dragon Back's trail make you feel like you are much further away from the hustle and bustle of the city.The trailhead is directly across the road from the To Tei Wan bus stop for the no. 9 bus for Shek O from Shaukeiwan MTR Station. The terminus is at Big Wave Bay, which also is served by the no. 9 bus.There are small shops and cafes/restaurants at Big Wave Bay. Venture down to the beach and you'll find a variety of choices. Big Wave Bay is popular with surfers. Hiking Dragon's Back, with travel time included, takes about is half-a-day, and is a great way to enjoy the beauty of the region."

Planning this walk can be confusing the geography is complicated and in fact there are several ways to attempt the dragons back. The HK tourist office in the arrival area ( before you leave the secure area) has a great free publication on hiking and cycling in HK with clear instructions for several walks including dragons back. Following their instructions will give you a longer hike than the one we did and you will walk in the same direction as most other hikers. We followed another group of walkers off the number 9 bus at a stop called COLLINSON on the display panel at the front of the bus ( several stops before the stop where we had planned to alight) walked up some cement steps then a longish steep cement road past some toilets and onto a track pointing to dragons back .At this point we turned right and started walking the dragons back walk in reverse if we had turned left we would have walked to big wave bay. walking the hike in the opposite direction is shorter, easier and still spectacular. We missed the section to BIG wave bay and finished the walk by descending to the bus stop where we should have begun! From there we caught a bus for the short ride down to Shek O as there was no foot path at all. I have also heard it is possible to do a much longer walk from the last station on the red line all the way to dragons back which would be interesting. The Hong Kong haze meant our views were limited ( no distant island views) but still spectacular . We had lunch at the Thai restaurant a wander around Shek O,walked out to the island and returned for a coffee in the funky little cafe near the Thai restaurant before returning to central. If you are interested in pushing on to Stanley it is possible to get off bus 9 on the return journey at the stop marked COLLINSON walk forwards to the junction then turn R . You should see another bus stop close by where you can catch bus number 14 to Stanley."

We took the number 9 bus and the driver advised us where the start point was for the shorter of the 2 walks. The first km or so is uphill, mostly steps cut into the hill. It's not too difficult if you take your time. The route then takes you across the summit of the hills - the Dragon's Back - and, on a good day, the views are great. It rained the day we did it, but it was still worthwhile even though visibility wasn't great and some of the walk was a bit slippery. The route back to Big Wave Bay is signposted, but sometimes to signs are partially hidden by vegetation or there's a side route that isn't signposted. We managed not to get lost and found a minibus back to Shek O, which cost $5 each, then teh number 9 bus back to town. Overall, a great way to spend some time in the open air for less than $20 each (transport cost, the walk is free!). Take water and snacks with you, as there's nothing available en route."

Before setting up for the Dragon's Back consider visiting the Tourism Board Office at the Star Ferry Pier - it's good to have a map of the whole trail at hand. Do not rely 100% on the hiking information contained in the leaflets though: it's written the trail is approx. 8,5 km and takes around 6 hours. If you are reasonably fit, however, it takes 2,5 hours. To get there: take the metro until Shau Kei Wan station (8 HKD from Central), exit A3 (Shau Kei Wan Bus Terminus) and from there bus n.9 to To Tei Wan (HKD 6.7). The bus ride will take around 20 min. The stops are indicated on a screen, but you will recognize on your left the beginning of the Dragon's Back Trail marked by hiking signs and a map board. The first part of the trail is rising fast but in most cases there are stone staircases, so it's quick and easy. The Shek O Peak is the highest point of the trail (284m) and from there the view is great. Just pay attention not to miss it, since it's not on the main route, but rather a deviation. It's not hard to find it: the first pavilion you encounter on your way marks a bifurcation: if you go straight you follow the main trail, but on your right is a little hidden path leading to the scenic point and later on reconnecting to the main trail. After that the road starts descending and the last section is enclosed in the forest, so it can get quite boring, specially because there are many other hikers - even if it's late afternoon and even if the weather is not great! - so you might lose the feeling of being in the nature. Anyway, at the end of the trail you will find Big Wave Bay Beach (eating in a local restaurant is about 5 HKD) - nothing special really. I think the best part of the whole trail was actually the scenic spot and the Dragon's Back view itself - the profile of the hills along the South-East part of Hong Kong Island. To get back: take a minibus from Big Wave Bay Beach (12 HKD) to Shau Kei Wan Bus Terminus."

It took us around an hour to reach the top and the view was breath-taking despite the slight fog. If you would like to get away from the skyscrapers and shopping malls for a little while & enjoy a little exercise, this is a great getaway. The hike was not difficult and that was evident by the many young families we met on the hike. We stopped for a little break at a picnic site on the way to Big Wave Bay and ended the trip at Big Wave Bay by taking a bus back to the Shau Kei Wan Station. The entire hike and journey took us around 3.5 hours.Remember to bring your own bottle of water and a little snack as there are no shops throughout the trail."

I would suggest you to walk in the road which says \"picnic site\" - the scene there is the best for photography! Note that when you reach the peak, you have a choice to continue walking straight or turn back. I would suggest that you walk straight and go down by there as it is much gentler. I would also strongly recommend all to bring your own hand sanitiser/wet tissues to wipe your hands after using the toilet instead of washing your hands in the sink as.....

There are arrows you can follow so you won't get lost and a few rest stops along the way. I recommend you to definitely bring water and a CAMERA. The view is amazing, as you climb up there are several spots where you feel like you are on top of the world. Make sure you start your trip in the morning as it's always dangerous being on a hike at night. Mostly go early because once you finish the hike, it ends up at Shek O beach! The beach is great and I always love when there are fun waves. I do recall seeing a floating dock that someone was playing with their dog on. Great atmosphere, there was some sort of festivities happening when we went. Definitely put this on your to do list!"

When we went there the weather was nice and warm (around 20 C) but at the top of the trail the wind was blowing strongly making the temp feel lower. There is no point going on a cloudy and hazy day because you will miss the wonderful view.We took the hike on a Sunday and the trail was so crowded that you had to wait in line in order to get through certain areas... So, if possible, go on a week day. The hike to the top is quite easy but you should have some hiking shoes with a good grip. I didn't and coming down was a bit challenging as I had no support for my ankles. After the hike, visit Shek O beach."

However, the hike was still fun and we had a tasty meal at the Chinese Thai restaurant in Shek O. Take the MTR to Shau Kei Wan station (towards the end of the blue line), take the bus depot exit and catch the No.9 to To Tei Wan. Don't be too worried about where to get off - the bus has an automated sign which will flash up each stop. The bus stop is directly at the start of the trail. The trail has adequate signage so it's hard to get lost. As a gym goer, the hike was fairly easy. There are some inclines but someone of moderate health would be just fine. Kids would be fine too. The hike can be completed between 2-3 hours depending on the pace. Just make sure you schedule this hike on a nice clear day otherwise you will see nothing. I'd recommend going during the week to beat any potential crowds - we only saw a handful of people.Also, make sure you have enough water and snacks for the duration of the hike as there are no shops until Big Wave Bay."

There weren't many people - we met a group at the start and lone hikers along the way - so it made for a nice change compared to crowded Hong Kong. The weather definitely wasn't on our side though, it was misty and we couldn't see anything at the top, so do check the weather forecast before going. Overall, it was an easy 5km hike which took 2 hours. At the end of the hike, there are signages to either Shek O road (where you can take bus no 9 from the opposite side of the road back to the interchange), or a 4km walk to Shek O beach. As the weather wasn't too good, we took bus no 9 from the same side of the road to the last stop and it brought us right to Shek O beach.Directions:We followed the directions given by many reviewers - exit A3 at Shau Kei Wan MTR station and take bus no 9 from the interchange. You can choose to alight at Tai Tam or To Tei Wan Village stop (there are panels on the bus showing the name of the stop in English) - they are just opposite ends of the same route. I would recommend starting from To Tei Wan village though. There were parts of the hike where we walked uphill which I feel would have been more difficult walking down.Do consider spending the day at Dragon's Back and Shek O beach. We left from Mongkok at 11 in the morning and returned at 6 in the evening. There is also a wet market set up every evening near the bus interchange, and it was fun walking and looking around."

Blue sea as far as the eye can see...We took the MTR to Shau kei Wan station, then walked the 3mins to the bus depot to catch the No. 9 bus (HKD6.90 by octopus card). Get off at stop #12 (To Tei Wan), and you'll be at the start of the trail. This hike is pretty popular so expect a lot of people to be hiking there too. There are a few paths you can choose to start your hike. We decided to go straight up; the first KM was pretty steep but after that, it levels off and the incline is more friendly. There are sign-posts almost every half KM and you'll have the option of choosing different paths. The one with the best view is straight up to Shek O Peak/Dragon's Back Peak. After the busy urban jungle, this hike is the needed breath of fresh air, and it definitely showed me a side of Hong Kong I didn't expect.This hike is a snore if you're a gym-goer and doable even if you're moderately fit. If kids as young as 5 can do it, there's really no excuse you can't make it to the top. The views will be worth it. We finished the Dargon's Back trail in 1.5hrs, and decided to continue hiking to Big Wave Bay, which was another 45mins frm the bottom of the hill. Getting transport back to Shau Kei Wan from Big wave Bay can be quite tricky. You can opt to take the mini-bus (at HKD12) or walk out 5mins to the main road past the small round-a-bout to the citybus bus stop (same bus to get there) for half-the cost."

The one downfall was that we went during the Chinese New Years and there were many busloads of people also hiking that same day.

Do not be anxious when you need to alight the bus because the bus has a panel stating the next bus stop. It makes sense to buy the Octopus Card at any MTR station and you can use this card to pay for all your transport. Once you reach \"TO TEI WAN\", you will see the trail there. The view is amazing and even on a weekend, you will not see the crowd like those in town. It was the highlight of our trip to Hong Kong and my wife and 2 adult kids were very happy. At the end of the trail, you will find a T-junction. We went to Big Wave Beach. The view was another winner. You will find bus number 9 there but it is one stop to Shek-O and you need to alight and re-board the bus 9 to get back to Shau Kei Wan.

To get to this point took around 2 hours at a relaxed pace. I'm sure a swim at the beach and perhaps a leisurely lunch would have been lovely, but we had a flight to catch.Pick a clear day and wear decent shoes/walking boots. If it's hot, take loads of water.There is a good map at the start and I recommend taking a photo of this if you haven't got a guide. There is one section where it's not entirely clear whether you turn right or left at a T-junction just after descending some steps; we turned right after much deliberation and this seemed to be the right choice!I highly recommend that you do this walk as it gives you a completely different perspective on Hong Kong, away from all the skyscrapers and crowds."

Make sure if you go and get dropped off by taxi ask them to drop you at the top of the observation point, the entrance is very small so be careful you might miss it. The entire hike took us 2.5 hrs, we are fit and work out a lot, we have heard it might take 4 hours depending on endurance. The steps are high and its a difficult hike but it's very worthy it. At the top of the mountain you get to see the south china sea and the north bay - its an amazing view!! If you can make it all the way down to the beach - you should, its really pretty - not much of a tons or bars, three at max little beach shacks, but we were able to get a sandwich and a cold beer. To get back to hong kong the best bet is to take the bus - but if you are really lucky like us, we caught a cab that was dropping someone off when we got to the bus stop - the can back is about 170 Hk dollars, or $21 US dollars - also worth not the hassle after an entire day."

The first part of the walk is uphill on mostly steps. You see some great views of the bays behind as you climb but the view from the first view from the top is awesome. You then meander along the ridge and up to the official top. It is all well marked.Then you commence a partial drop until you come to a T junction and turn right. This next part of the walk is flat and you cannot see too much because of trees etc. it takes about 30 minutes to complete this section before you turn right towards the bay. At this junction there are toilets.Then a section on a road before starting a very uneven stretch to the bay. This part is where you need good footwear and by the time we got to the bay we were both feeling the uneven rocks through our trainers.Super little bay but disappointed that the cafe on beach (Eric's) served mostly European food. We went into the village for local fare and after eating a very nice meal back to the cafe on the front for a beer in the sun looking over beach and sea. NB if we revisited we would get the restaurant to do us a takeaway and take this to the beach. Good clean toilets at the beach.Short walk to the bus stop and we caught the mini bus back to MTR for $10 each. Driver knew when no. 9 bus was due and set off about 10 mins before.The walk took us approx 2.5 hours and we did not rush and had plenty of water and picture stops.A super day out which we would recommend."

Then it is signed all the way, firstly for Dragon's Back, then Big Wave Bay, and then Shek O - but take a bus from Big Wave Bay to Shek O, there is nothing to see and you have to walk down a main road. The walk is tough in parts, but nothing that this somewhat overweight 43 yr old couldn't manage, knowing there was cold beer and Shek O's wonderful beach and food at the end of it, and the views once you are on the Dragon's Back are magnificent, it's difficult to believe you are actually on HK Island."

After a week in HK, and thoroughly enjoying the beautiful, but chaotic pace of busy HK, I wasn't sure I wanted to do a hike through the hills - I get out and walk through nature all the time back home, so why would I want to do it here? Well, I'm thrilled I made the effort, because walking the Dragon's Back is one of the highlights of my two week trip to HK! We got dropped by a taxi on Chek O Bay Road and immediately ascended as we started the walk. A few hours later (about 6km I think?), we were looking down on Big Wave Bay and the village of Chek O, with their beautiful beaches and picturesque, rocky coastline! It's a distinctly different side to HK's bustling shopping, dining and touring experience! Make the effort!"

If your criteria for a hike is a scenic view then I would definitely recommend the Dragon's back hike. Moreover on completion of this hike you land up in either Shek O beach (more commercial) or Big Wave Bay beach (more secluded). The site of surfers surfing, dogs running, and a little snack bar to satisfy the big post hike hunger pang, is extremely rewarding! It took us 3 hours to complete this undulating hike. A day well spent in Hong Kong. If you take the island line from central to Shau Kei Wan, it will take you around 20 minutes to reach. Grab Mc Donalds or some other grub at Shau Kei Wan and then take the number 9 bus (the terminus is located outside exit A3 of the MTR) to Shek O road. It will take another 20-30 minutes to reach so even if you leave from central at noon you will easily complete the hike before sunset."

            "review": "Dragon's back hiking. Just returned from an afternoon trek across Dragon's back in Hong Kong.I would suggest it a great day outing if you are tired of the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong and want to take a break from seeing the throngs of people in HK and Kowloon. Though I would suggest the best time to do the walk is when there is less people on the mountain as parts of the track are quite narrow. As we did the hike in Winter and not on the week end, there were very few people to be seen. We had read other reports on Trip Adviser and comments made by hikers who had to beat off crowds. I could understand that on busy days it would be very frustrating to do the walk, when the sole purpose was to avoid crowds, so best check with the HK tourist board to check on the crowds before heading off. We started making our way on the MTR from Tsim Sha Tsui at 3pm so we thought we might miss the morning rush (if it existed) on the mountain. It was also a lot cooler especially on the return leg. Today is Jan 3rd and the day's temp was 21 deg celsius. It was quite warm in downtown Kowloon so my wife and I were a little hesitant in doing the trek due to the warm weather in Tsim Sha Tsui, however when we returned to our hotel and sat around, we thought what the heck, let's do it, even though we had no caps/hats to wear to shield the sun. This as it turned out was not really necessary as most of the walk (except the Dragon's back section) was sheltered by the shrubbery. We also didn't have sunglasses ,nor did i have shorts - as you can see we were not really dressed for the part. We did however both have our sneakers (runners) which was fortunate. I would suggest comfortable footwear and loose fitting clothes.How to get there: Fairly simple.Take MTR Blue line toward Chai Wan. Get off at Shau Kei Wan stop. Exit the station via A3 exit and head across the road toward the bus depot. Look for No.9 bus (On our day it was the line of buses furtherest away from the MTR exit). We scanned our Octopus card on the bus. If i remember correctly the bus fare was HK$6.90. Then took the bus ride up the narrow (Shek O) road and got off at stop \"To Tei Wan\".Then as we got off the bus we immediately saw the wooden sign \"Dragon's back\" walk. There was also an aerial map of the region outlining the pathways and place names and distances.The climb up Dragon's back for the first 1km was quite rugged, so i would suggest people with leg/joint problems might find the going a bit tough. The path gets a little narrow in some spots and the path surface is uneven/irregular due to the numerous exposed rocks, however there are resting spots along the way. A moderate degree of fitness is highly recommended for the uphill climb to reach the top/ridge of Dragon's back. However getting to the top is well worth the climb. The view is breath taking! We decided to continue the walk to Big Wave bay. There were several options along the way to cut short the walk, however it was still light and we made good progress (as i am a relatively fast walker) so we thought to follow the path down to where we looked down upon when we were on top of the mountain - so the walk would finish at the quaint surf beach of Tai Long Wan.The HK tourist board website advises that the Dragon's walk is 8.5km and the ave. hiking time is 6hrs. We completed the walk in 2 hrs (we jogged approx 1km on part of the descent on the boring concreted section which had a gentle gradient). We were concerned about making a dinner deadline so we thought we should hurry up. So I think the 6hr time frame is very generous. The weather also helped and by the time we started our descent the sun was less strong and so the weather conditions were very pleasant. We capped it off with ice creams at the final destination. There are no drinking stations so bring water and food if required. We did not wait for the No. 9 bus for the return journey, as not to long after we waited, a maxi bus (seats approx 16 people) turned up - fix rate HK$10 back to Shau Kei Wan MTR station.I noticed that on the way back there were more people waiting at stops along the way back, however as our bus was full the driver waved them down. I guess in reaching the terminal part of the walk has the advantage of ensuring a seat back on the next bus/maxibus/taxi. All in all a great day away from the mad rush in downtown HK."

            "review": "Hike the Dragons Back- Asia's best urban hiking trail!!!. There are a number of ways to reach the start of the Dragons Back or even extend the hike slightly if you wish.One option is to start at Big Wave Bay, this can be reached by getting off at Shau Kei Wan MTR (on the blue Island Line). Just outside the station you will find a bus terminal (or taxi rank, although this option is more expensive) take number 9 bus to the end of the route, Big Wave Bay. From here start the hike which will initially be signposted 'Hong Kong Trail' and will eventually turn into the Dragons Back. This will extend your trip length and you will get to visit the untouched and local village at Big Wave Bay. A second option is to get off at Shau Kei wan station, take bus number 9 to Tei Wan stop along the Shek O road, the hike starts directly opposite the bus stop.Alternatively you can get off at Chai Wan MTR (on the blue Island Line) start your hike directly from outside Chai Wan station, where you will quickly ascend to the start of the Dragons Back through a series of steep steps through a graveyard. The choice really is yours.The Dragons Back really is a fabulous hike, apart from the initial ascent the hike is relatively easy and accessible to most abilities including families. However, do wear a pair of good hiking shoes, take plenty of water and sunscreen as there is limited sun protection at the top. There is a reason that the Dragons Back is HKG's top day hiking trail, the view are fabulous as far as the eye can see from from Tai Long Wan, Tung Lung island, Shek O and Big Wave Bay. Try and choose a clear day if possible to do the hike as the view reaches as far as the outlying islands on clear days. The hike itself is approx 8km in length and should take an average walker stopping for photos 2-3hours. There are no facilities or replenishing stations along the way, so be prepared to stock up in advance at Shau Kei Wan station. The Dragons Back allows you peace and solace in otherwise one of the worlds busiest cities, I would recommend visiting in the week and certainly not on public holiday, if you just want to 'get away from it all'. Once you have seen all the views and taken all the photos you wanted, then you will gently head down onto the Shek O road, where a bus stop is conveniently located at the end. Take Bus 9 again back to Shau Kei Wan MTR where you can head on back into the city.A good note to remember, if you buy an Octopus Card (our equivalent of an Oyster card in the UK) at one of the MRT stations you can pre load it, you can then use this card anywhere that has the Octopus sign, so you can buy your train tickets, bottles of water in MTR stations and your bus tickets on Bus 9. This is really useful and means you have to take little if no cash with you on your hike. The Dragons Back, is a must when in HKG a great morning or afternoon away from the hustle bustle of city life, but short enough so that you have time to return to the twinkling lights of city to experience Hong Kong by night."

The trail is well-connected to the public transport, so it is really easy to get there and back. Thanks to the numerous signs and maps along the way and fellow hikers there is no need for a map or GPS devices. The hike takes around 2-2,5 hours with an easy-going pace and several photo-shooting breaks. There are only a few parts where it is a bit steeper, but even children and older people managed it, so this shouldn't keep anybody. In case you can spare a whole day and want a more challenging hike I would recommend the Sai Kung Peninsula Hike, which was (in my opinion) even more fascinating."

Like its name, the hike goes up and down initially, but towards to ends, its more of walking around the hill. Its a hike where you could see where you are heading to and the scenery from the peak, its pretty awesome. You'll get a bird's eye view of Hong Kong, where the different areas are and what's there (like the rich mansions, prisons, and boys home scattered around the different parts of Hong Kong). And the hike ends at Big Wave Beach, and a village there as well. Be sure to check out the Thai food there! The pad thai there is pretty decent and after the long hike (about 4 hours), its even more delicious! Take some time to hang out by the beach too! I'm sure to check it out the next time and surf there (as so the name suggests, its a good place to surf!). Definitely a must go place when you're in Hong Kong! Take a cab down to the start of the mountain, its not so much of a touristry hike, but the cab drivers will surely know where it is. The start of the hike is Shek O! "

We thought we might have to get a taxi from the Shau Kei Wan MRT but walked out at exit A1 (or A2) and found a mini bus that took us straight there. The mini bus leaves when full but we found that it only took about 5 to fill and the first stop it made on its way to Big Wave Beach was at the start of the Dragon back walk. The best part about the mini bus was that it didn't keep stopping everywhere like a regular bus and only cost HK $10 each. The walk itself has beautiful views. The only reason I did not give he walk 5/5 is because it was a little over crowded and if you like a fast pace walk it can get frustrating at times during the first part of the walk as there are many leisurely walkers taking their time. People are happy enough if you ask to pass though. We ended our walk down at Big Wave Beach which was beautiful. Places to eat and buy beachy things. Upon our departure towards Shek O we saw the mini bus again which was going straight back to the MRT so decided to get on that instead of walk to Shek O! Lovely day out :-) We weren't ready for the beach but if I went back I would take some beach things to enjoy a nice afternoon on the beach after the walk!"

This bus terminus is situated at the Shau Kei Wan MTR station. So just get to the MTR station first.The bus displays the next coming stop. Just get down at the To Tei Wan stop. There are porta loos just before the start if you need to take a leak. The initial climb is hard but not as hard as the climb I had to Qixingshan in Yamingshan National Park from Xiaoyoukeng. After that it is undulating as you walk along the ridge of the \"Dragon's Back\". After Shek O Peak, it gets boring as you descend towards Big Wave Beach. We started at 12:30pm and ended at 4:45pm on Big Wave Beach with some stops along the way. At Big Wave Beach, bus number 9's frequency gets less and you will most likely be met with a red top minibus for the ride back to Shau Kei Wan. Fee is HKD10 and the driver is very persuasive. He is right though as you will most likely wait 2 hours for the next bus if you came to the bus stop at 5:00pmAs suggested, the best months for any type of hiking in Hong Kong is during the winter months of Dec to Feb. We came in Dec but was fortunate to have clear skies but cold temperatures of 11-15 deg C. It was raining for three days prior.Will be considering Pat Sin Leng.

Surely this is part of the reason why I love HK, but I was surprised to learn that you within striking distance can find tranquility and really beautiful scenery.I went to Dragon's Back by public transport which is a mix of the metro (Shau Kei Wan) and a local bus (#9). As the stops are announced on route in Chinese and English it's simply a matter of knowing which stop to get off at (To Tei Wan stop).From here you can't go wrong.The hike is pleasant and the views really great."

But it was definitely a good workout! The views at the top and along the route were awesome. I would love to try it again, but with shoes this time. Also did not have a chance to walk the entire trail. Wish we had set aside more time. The only hitch was trying to find the entrance. We kind of wandered a bit after exiting the bus, but eventually found it. Well worth it!"

We were jetlagged and woke up at 5AM - what to do!? We scoured several travel brochures from the hotel lobby and finally found a self guided hike in a small article with obscure bus instructions to get there.... After an hour and 2 busses later... We were finally dropped off at a deserted stop in the middle of nowhere on Hong Kong island. Oh the horror. What have we done!!?? We quickly found the obscure trail beginning and tentatively started the hike. After about 30 minutes we started seeing other people and felt a little more comfortable. I think it was about an hour into the hike when you are hit with this absolutely stunning 360 degree view of sky scrapers, beautiful green mountains, and amazing resort towns. Not at all what I would expect from Hong Kong island. It was so diverse. After we descended on the other side of the mountain, we made our way to a small town right on the beach. We bought a couple of beers and put or feet in the sand on the ocean. Amazing. It was by far my favorite day on the entire Asia trip (HK, Thailand, Tokyo)... You must do it."

After a heavy yum cha lunch, we took the MTR to Shau Kei Wan. From the bus terminal, we hopped onto bus 9 (HKD 6.90) to To Tei Wan. The start of the trail is just right beside the bus stop. To our surprise, there were quite a number of fellow hikers there today, considering its a Tuesday afternoon. The view from the beginning of the hike to the Shek O Peak was breathtaking. It took us about an hour to get there. It's quite a tedious 1 hour though.From the peak, we continued on towards the direction of Tai Tam Gap. It's a much easier hike from here, however the view was almost nonexistence. Towards the end of the trail, we were at a split road (paved road) 1 goes towards Tai Tam Gap and the other Big Wave Bay. We walked towards the latter and arrived at Big Wave Bay in 45 mins. Total distance travelled 8.5km in around 2.5hrs. "

We followed a ridge line through some amazing scenery, up through some wooded areas with a paved trail, to a peak with ocean on both sides.

The problem with the dragon back section of the Hong Kong trail is that it is the most famous one. During the weekends gets very crowded here. This put a damper on the experience. When you have this scenic landscape and beautiful views you don\u2019t want it to be over crowded.There are other sections of the trek where you will be almost alone and were the views in my opinion is much more beautiful. I have been living in Hong Kong for two years now and been trekking almost every weekend.If you would like to know more about trekking in Hong Kong there is a great book called \u201cThe Serious Hiker\u2019s Guide to Hong Kong\u201d. It describes the three major trekking trails in Hong Kong (The Hong Kong Trail, The Wilson Trail and The MacLehouse Trail) with pictures of each section and detailed information about how to get there and the level of the trek. These three treks are also marked on google maps if you would like to do your own research.My personal favorites are the trek in Sai Kung, Tai Long Wan (MacLehouse Stage 2) or on Hong Kong Island the trek around Tai Tam reservoir (Hong Kong Trail stage 5 and 6)."

We started the walk in the middle of the trail, by getting the number 9 bus from Shau Kei Wan to Collision Road (1st stop after the tiny roundabout), and walking up the stairs to the right of the correctional facility. We headed toward Shek O, although you can go to Big Wave Beach as well. The first part of the walk is pretty easy, walking through forest on a well worn path. We turned left after a km or 2 to climb the Dragon's Back. Wow, what an unexpected treat at the top. The view to both The Stanley Peninsula and Big Wave and Shek O is spectacular. Beautiful water, magnificent houses and the most immaculately mown golf course. Obviously where the elite of Hong Kong spend their weekends. We then walked back down to Shek O road.The trail is an easy enough walk for a relatively fit person with a few steep parts. The section we walked was about 5 km and took 1.5 hours walking fairly briskly including stops for photos at the top. Take water, as there is none available near or on the trail. We went on a weekend along with every man and his dog (literally, we saw at least 5 dogs on the trail) and we don't like to meander so if you can avoid weekends I'd do so. After the walk we took a taxi to Shek O beach (also the end of the line for the number 9 bus). It's great for people watching and the beach is beautiful and well kept. There are drop toilets and showers and plenty of places to eat on and around the beach. We ate by the roundabout in a funky burger place sitting next to a Great Dane. As you do :-)"

We managed to take it slowly and did fine. We completed the trail end-to-end, and managed to catch a taxi to Shek-O for lunch afterward.

The Dragon's Back is part of the Hong Kong Trail, Stage 8, and is a quick and easy (approx 1-2 hours) hike, depending on the chosen ingress point (of which there are many). Probably the easiest way is to take a bus to Tai Long Wan (Big Wave Bay) and hike Stage 8 backwards, which will make Shek O Road the egress point from where you could catch a bus back to civilisation. The top of Dragon's Back has some very good views of Stanley Peninsula on one side, and Shek O on the other. It can get very hot there in the middle of summer as there is no shade and no wind, though it does get very windy there in winter. Nevertheless it's a far cry from being one of the better trails in Hong Kong."

It took only about 1.5 hours to do the trek and then you can walk down a road to Shek O beach but that looked a bit dull so I caught a bus.

I started in a small round about where I was suppose to get off the bus. 5 minutes later I arrived to the women prision so I knew I was in the right spot. There is not too many people so you can just enjoy the nature. After a couple hours you arrive to the Dragons Back (you will see a sign) where the view is spectacular. I made my way down to the Shek O village by bus (dont walk along the road... there is nothing else to see) where I could enjoy a quick swim in the beach, eat nice and relatively cheap seafood. Also they have some kind of cliffs over there that you totally need to see. 100% recommended."

If you wanted a 2-3 hour that is not so strenuous, something that you can easily travel to, doesn't need real mountain boots and a hiking pole, I'd recommend the dragons back. I started my hike from To Tei Wan, where I have got off from the Sau Kei Wan Metro station and took bus no 9. Don't worry about not knowing when to get off, you can either talk to the driver, other passengers or just look at the sign board for the correct stop. After getting off from To Tei Wan, you'll automatically see the sign boards with a map, and I just followed the route crossing the dragon's back and reach Big Wave Bay. This entire section is around 10 km long and I think the maximum elevation is not beyond 300m. If you go on a clear day, you'll see the entire southern part of Hong Kong island which is gorgeous.Best of all, when we finish the hike, we landed on a beach and took brunch at the beach side cafe. They serve pretty authentic continental all day breakfast, international snacks and cold beer!!!"

There are a few steep section s but nothing that a reasonable fit person can't tackle. Start at the Correctional Centre on Shek O road. After a while walking on the flat you'll come out into the first of many amazing views.Once we walked in the late afternoon and had the phenomenal sight of the sun setting on one side of the Dragon's Back and the moon rising on the other. Probably good to have a torch with you for the descent if you leave it too late! The wind on the crest can be fierce at times but oh those views!!! Both sides of the back you can see the beauty of Hong Kong, something that few tourists ever get to see. It's a wonderful place to be when you're up in the hills but most visitors miss it unless they know a resident who likes walking.You can end up either on the Shek O road or on Tai Long Wan Beach. If you choose to descend to Shek O Road you can catch a bus down into Shek O village and have a well earned beer and excellent seafood at the restaurant by the roundabout. Check out Shek O beach too.Buses and taxis back can be difficult at peak periods and the weekend so try to time your visit \"off peak\""

We had to ask when to get off along Shek O Road to find the start of the trail (it is the first stop on Shek O Road). The trail is well sign posted, and fairly easy walking with a bit of steeper sections. The views along the walk are wonderful! We did the walk on a hot and humid summer day, and sweated a lot. At the end of the trail we caught a number 9 bus into Shek O for a dip in the sea, some lovely cold beer and Thai food. A great afternoon!

The Dragons back is a glorious walk- strenuous enough to make you feel like you've done some exercise but enjoyable for the whole family. The gorgeous views of the crystal blue seas and golden beaches on either side of the ridge are what keep you marveling and heading upwards. On a sunny day you can see for miles and it looks like you're in Hawaii!It's really easy to get to as well. MTR to Shau Kei Wan (Island line) then once out of the MTR head to the bus depot right beside and get the number 9. Get some water before you get on the bus because there are no shops to buy water until the end of the walk. The bus will climb uphill and once it gets past all the buildings it will head into forests. Keep an eye out, You will go past a tiny roundabout and you get off right after this. The bus takes about 10 minutes. Next to the stop are some steps heading up the hill, well signposted to the Dragons back. (The steps are on the same side you get off the bus next to Tai Tam gap correctional facility.) The walk takes between 1- 1.5 hours, depending on how often you stop to take photos! Well maintained steps and paths.It's well worth heading down to the Shek O road and taking a very short bus ride to Shek O village. Amazing Thai seafood restaurant - no.303 as you come into village on the left- and beautiful clean beach with showers as a reward for your efforts. Then you can catch the bus straight back to Shau Kei Wan."

It is a \"medium\" level hike with some steep steps and uneven sandy paths here and there but it is really not that difficult. It is very rewarding once you reach the top with the stunning views of the mountains and seas. Remember to bring lots of water if you are hiking in the summer as the heat can really gets onto you. My journey started from Central Station to Shau Kei Wan which took me about 20 minutes and the bus journey was another 20-30 minutes depending on traffic condition as the roads are mainly single lane. As i didn't bring enough water, i couldn't carry on further towards the Hong Kong Trail and another continuing trail once i reach the top. The Dragon's back is just about 1 kilometers and 283 meters in height. In all, it took me about an hour going up and exiting down to the base. I would definitely go back again and continue my hike with the continuing trails the next time.

Just spectacular views and at parts of the trail slightly challenging of a run. I think it took about 2hours, mainly because we stopped at various photo ops. Afterwards we hopped in a cab (but there are buses too) and headed down to Shek'O Beach. Shek'O is a delightful beach town right below the Dragon's Back. There are many cafes and bars on the water, it is a great little town. By train this area of Hong Kong is about an hour from the city.

            "review": "Very enjoyable trail hike. I read about this trail in an in-flight magazine on my way into Hong Kong and thought it sounded like a great hike.There are a bunch of websites that feature this trail but some of them are a bit confusing and a couple make it out to be a tough hike. It really isn't: there are a few relatively steep sections, and if it's been raining recently some sections are a bit muddy, but I saw one couple hiking in flip-flops and there were some pretty young kids too, so it's definitely do-able for most people. The best trail map is on the Discover Hong Kong website.One nice feature of the trail is that it breaks into a number of sections, and you can potentially bail out (or start) at any of these points. One website puts the trail length at 8.5km but I don't think it can be that long as I did it in under two-and-a-half hours. The trail starts at To Tei Wan towards the southern tip of Hong Kong island. You get to the trail head by taking the MTR to Shau Kei Wan and then a number 9 bus from there. The bus journey is maybe 10-15 minutes, and you need to watch out for the stop as it's pretty easy to miss (or ask the driver to tell you where to get off). You start by walking up steps cut into the hillside, eventually reaching Shek O Peak which is 284m above sea-level and about a quarter of the way along the trail. Along the way there are some nice views both East (over Shek O Village) and West. Some of this section runs through forest so it's dappled shade, but much is exposed so if you are fair-skinned bring a hat & sun-cream.After Shek O Peak the trail levels out a bit, though there's still some up-and-down, and more of it is through the forest. You then start to descend and some of this section is quite steep and can be slippery if it's been raining. There were a lot of butterflies and I could hear birdsong though I failed to spot any of the birds. Eventually you will come to Tai Tam Gap which is your first potential bug-out point. You're about 60% of the way around the trail so it's a good place to evaluate how you're feeling. If you choose to continue, the next section's a bit disappointing because it's a concrete road, though there are some tantalizing glimpses of a hillside cemetery through the trees in places. Don't worry though, it's a short section! It ends at Pottinger Gap (Ma Tong Au), another potential bug-out point if you're too weary to continue. Some people start the trail here and work it backwards down to To Tei Wan (see one review of this approach at Roz's Hiking Pages, for example). The final section is about another 2km and is all down-hill -- sometimes quite steep steps cut into the hillside -- leading to Big Wave Bay. It's pretty much entirely through forest, and so there's not much view plus you have to spend some concentration avoiding tree roots etc.... but I think it's rewarding to have done the whole thing and the Bay at the bottom is nice.There are a few places to eat & drink at the Beach which is very close to the end of the trail but this is really your first opportunity for water anywhere along the trail so it's quite sensible to take something with you on the hike.At Big Wave Beach there are supposed to be some pre-historic rock carvings but I didn't want to do any more walking by that time...... From here you can get back to Shau Kei Wan MTR via the number 9 bus or various little minibuses all of which leave from the road leading down to the beach."

The trail is very well indicated and well maintained, so almost impossible to get lost. The first mile or so is steeply uphill on steps, then the trail opens out and meanders up and down until you get to the ridge. If it is sunny the views stretch far east and west, which makes the effort worthwhile. Most days there is mist or low cloud which somewhat spils the view, but if you are interested in circling birds of prey, paragliders or just a good walk away from the hustle and bustle of the city the walk is very enjoyable. It is not a tough walk, but decent shoes do help, especially if you do the whole walk all the way round to Big Wave Bay. The descent to BWB is slippy if it has rained, so sandals are out. Take the local bus back to Shau Kei Wan MTR for 10HK$."

From our hotel on Hong Kong island to the jump off point for the hike took us less than 50 minutes by public transport, so it gives you an idea of how accessible it is. Yet once you start the walk, it is not hard to imagine yourself anywhere but in Hong Kong, with fantastic views over bays and headlands, and a well marked pathway. We were there on a weekday, so it was secluded but I can imagine it probably gets crowded at the weekend. Although the hike is billed as moderately difficult, anyone can do it, its only a question of how long you take. The stairs at the beginning are probably the hardest part, but well worth the view once you reach Shek O peak. Thereafter, the hike is relatively flat and easy, up to the last bit, which is the way down to Big Wave Bay where there are more stairs.Bus number 9 from Shau Kei Wan MTR station takes you directly to the start of the hike, and hopping on a light public bus (HKD10) out from Big Wave Bay is probably the best way out back to Shau Kei Wan MTR. Total time for the walk at a leisurely pace was about 3 hours."

From here to go EXIT A3, up the stairs you'll come to Street Level and there is an open bus terminal there. Walk to the far end and catch BUS 9. It runs to Shek O but you will want to get off at Stop 12 - TO TEI WAN (there is an electronic sign with all the stops in English and Chinese so you won't miss it). Cost is approx. $7HKD. Once you leave the bus, the hike trail begins at your feet. Commence walking through the bamboo forest almost vertically for the next ten-fifteen minutes. You are now on the Dragon Back Trail, so take your time and enjoy every moment. About fifteen minutes into your walk you will come across a Wooden Building with sign posts directing you to either TAI TAM GAP/HONG KONG TRAIL/SHEK O - pay attention to this and turn off your current pathway and walk to the RIGHT past the Wooden Building/Picnic Stop and go on the HONG KONG TRAIL (a.k.a., but unknown to me.. DRAGON BACK TRAIL)\u2026 I proceeded to continue along a very flat pathway along the mountain to TAI TAM GAP and i wasted 40 minutes, its a nice view and easy walk but you don't get to the mountain top - ever.The rest of the walk is a series of vertical stairs and rocky pathways. I recommend for those who are agile, don't have any knee or ankle injuries, and are able to walk on uneven surfaces. A few times i was required to climb with my hands on the earth for assistance so you will need to be physically strong, but not necessarily fit. The view from the top is amazing, mind blowing, surreal and magical. Below you lies the South China Sea, the Golf Course, the undulating mountain sides, the Beaches, Shek O and Big Wave Bay. Eagles catch the thermals while Paraglider's soar with the Sea Breeze. If you don't want to/can't continue along, turn around and walk back the way you came, back to SHEK O ROAD and catch Bus 9 back to the MTR.Be sure to take water and have layers of shirts to accommodate to constant changing weather and temperatures and do not wear jeans in any circumstance as you need to be comfortable and agile. The hike took me three hours (with an unfortunate detour (40 minutes), stop at Shek O Peak and return back to Shek O Road (120 minutes) and allow half an hour each way to and from Hong Kong.Remember to catch your breath at the top, and enjoy all that this beautiful country is offering you."

It's too far from the harbour to see it clearly though, so that's probably not a good reason to make the climb."

            "review": "A Nice Hike in HK. The reviewers are right, taking a hike on the Dragon's Back Trail is a great way to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life in HK. To get here, it's not a far journey, yet you feel as though, you are far away from the city. From research, you can make a long hike out of this, OR you can make a short hike out of this. To take the long hike, take the MTR to the Shao Kei Wan Station. Head to the bus terminal to take bus No. 9. Get off at the Cape Collision stop, where Tai Tam Gap Correctional Facility is situated. Next to the correctional facility, is a stone staircase leading up to the trail. Follow the trail and the sign \u201cDragon\u2019s Back\u201d \uff08\u9f8d\u810a). After about 1 hour\u2019s walk, you will come to the top of the mountain, and you shall see a beautiful view of the sea and mountain. Going downhill, follow the direction going to the \u201cShek O Road\u201d. Once you arrive at the Shek O Road, at an area called To Dei Wan (\u571f\u5730\u7063\uff09, take bus No. 9 back to the opposite direction and you will be back at the bus terminal where the Shau Kei Wan MTR station is.I was limited with time because of dinner plans, I chose the short way. I took the No. 9 bus, and got off at To Dei Wan. For first time visitors, in the bus, the next stop/destination will be indicated, so To Dei Wan will appear on the panel to indicate that it will be the next stop. Press the red button on the bus to let the driver know you want to get off. Once you get off the bus, there is a sign that says Dragon's Back trail.You will follow the path up, where you will go through many inclines (not to strenuous); you will walk up dirt roads and stairs. I believe it was about a 20 minute walk to reach the top. I'm a fast walker, so it may take others a bit longer. I really enjoyed this hike, it only took about 2 hours for me. I went on a weekday earlier this month, and I only saw about 2 other hikers on this trail. Also, I enjoy running, so if there are any trail runners, the Dragon's Back trail is a nice place to run as well!"

Shau Kei Wan Station/ A3, or Bus 9, or minibus to Shek-O (which is just off the MTR exist and quicker, but could wind up waiting awhile unless there's a line, which more often than not there is). Tell the driver you want to take he Dragon Back trail.Lots of views over the ocean and S/Bay of HK. Nice picnic benches on the summit of each hill.Can be a bit crowded on prime weather days, but even then it's not overwhelming.Most of the hike is pretty flat, making it good for all ages.You can get lunch at either Big Wave Bay or Shek-O depending on which direction you walk. Better food at Shek-O."

            "review": "Wonderful family hike. We were at Dragon's back with our kids, aged 7 and 4 this past weekend. The weather is finally cooler and the hiking season starts. This trail was crowded but still very enjoyable. What I also like about this trail is that it starts half way up the hill so it's relatively flat on top hence very manageable for kids. Our kids hiked the entire length for slightly over 3 hours. I did carry the 4 year old for a few minutes in the last hour but he was happy to walk on his own for the remainder of the trail. We also made a game of finding the 'blue dots\" on rocks (trail markers) and the kids loved it. The view over Shek-O is always georgeous. We have also seen people paragliding on these hills before. Take the No. 9 bus from Shau Kei Wan MTR station and tell the driver to stop at the Trail head in Shek O road. Once on top, you can follow the sign back to Shek O Road (Tau Dei Wan) direction or all the way to Shek O beach (Tai Tam direction). Parking hear the trail head is almost impossible so i don't recommend driving.If you only have time for 1 hike in HK you should seriously consider this one. I have done it 4-5 times over the last 8 years and the view is always impressive from the top. If you do this hike in the winter months do bring a wind breaker. It gets chilly with the wind on top."

Prob a little over the top but like i say I've never hiked and for all i know i cld be on some mountain rescue program from falling! Anyway, the hk mtr is easy to navigate. I took a taxi from shau kai Wan to the start of the hike on shek o road. Taxi was hkd43. Cld hv took a bus but the queue was miles long.Up the very first steep hill at the start of the hike i was huffing away and realising why i don't hike!That said, the trail was rly good. It was steep in places and the paths can be a danger if ur clumsy like me and don't lookwhr u put ur feet on the uneven ground. The views are awesome.Yes, the trail is busy and full of ppl so don't check reviews then be surprised how busy it is!I finished in big wave bay which was bit naff compared to othr beaches I've seen but u can get a hotdog, beer and chill after ur walk.Id advise leaving before it starts getting dark. The bus queue was bad. I waited about 80mins, and don't think u can get the bus further down the road and walk away from the queue. I tried that to beat queues but the buses don't stop. Just queue and live with it.I set off at 1215 midday in 33 degree heat. Im mid 30s and abt average fitness and it wasn't a hard walk by any means.Def do it if u have a day and want to get out the city (but maybe not away from ppl!)"

The first half of the walk is shaded and tranquil, and the second half you're in the sun, but with great views - despite the smog. It's not a loop, and if you start from Cape Collision Rd the entrance is across the road, up a set of narrow stairs. The trail ends at Shek O Rd, but if you wish there are other trails that splinter off to neighboring towns. As soon as you finish the hike, you'll see a bus stop on both sides of the street. Cross the road to get the bus back to the terminal. See below:To the starting point:MTR Shau Kei Wan Station Exit A3 and take Bus 9 for Shek O at the Shau Kei Wan bus terminus, making sure to get off at Cape Collinson Road.

The hike took me about 2 hours, and the first quarter to third is shaded. And then the vistas begin once you get out of the shrubs and trees blocking your view. From thereonin you are exposed to the elements but treated to a challenge up and down path with vistas on both sides. It can be pushingly hot, so bring water,a hat and definitely wear sunscreen if it's a sunny day. But the view of the South China Sea, Shek O town, and the skyscrapers in the distance are unbeatable. After you reach the end of the path you will find yourself on Shek O Road. From there you can wait for another bus across the street to get back to Shau Kei Wan (the bus stop on your side will not take you to the MTR stop). I didn't take the KMB bus back - in fact I hopped in a public light bus (or 'siu baa') back to the subway station for just a few HKD. Not a scam, but a legitimate alternative form of transport mostly used by locals.Overall, for those not afraid of some sun, and some walking. A great intro to the wonderful hiking HK has to offer."

            "review": "Beautiful, but more challenging than other reviews would lead you to believe!. The views from the Dragon's back are absolutely stunning and breathtaking! It is definitely worth the hike. I do feel that we were mislead about how \"easy\" the trail was to hike. The reason the trail is called the \"Dragon's back\" is because it curves up and down the top of the mountain and it looks like it is the back of a dragon. These are not gentle hills, they can be quite steep in areas (both going up and down). There are stairs in some areas and just steep dirt with occasional rocks in others. The trail is also in full sun with very little shade. On a clear day, the heat can be almost unbearable. Pack plenty of water and hats/umbrella's for shade. I sweat through all of my clothing! After completing the section known as the Dragon's back, there are other paths that are much more level and less challenging- although the terrain on the trail is far from even. We travelled through mud, rocks, twigs, roots, and over waterfalls to reach our final destination. It was a beautiful hike, but we had to constantly watch our footing to avoid tripping or falling off the cliff. :) We had read other reviews on trip advisor stating that this trail would be good for all families. Let me tell you, it is not meant for the younger crowd. I ended up carrying my son up the hills. I am at a moderate to high fitness level, and I found this trail to be a little difficult. My knees and ankles were sore the next day. If you have 3 hours to kill, this is a great experience...just be aware of what you are getting yourself into."

It's the last part of a much larger trail that extends across HK island. It is a very good walk not taxing at all and even people who don't exercise regularly can complete this within 3 hours. Dragon's back is easily accessible from the central part of HK by taxi, bus and MTR. One can reach the Shau Kei Wan MTR station within 15 mins from CBD, from there bus no 9 takes you to Shek O road, get off at the stop 12 mins into the journey near the correctional facility. Start the climb from where the board indicates. The intial steps are steep after which the trail is uphill but along a well trodden path, follow directions to the Dragon's back trail when you come to a Y fork. An hour or so into the trail you'll reach another T where one path goes to Dragon's back whereas the other goes to Big Bay (if I'm not mistaken). From here you follow the path to the top of Dragon's back taking in wonderful vistas on both sides. The way down from the trail is much faster (and hence tougher if you are coming up as it's steeper) and you'll end up once again further down on Shek O Road. From here you can take bus # 9 headed to Shau Kei Wan MTR or a minibus headed that way. Alternatively you can easily go to Stanley for a much deserved beer and lunch. Do make your way out to 3 hours of scenic beautiful exercise when in HK."

The spectacular views across Shek O and Tai Tam Bay make it well worth the effort. Some of the terrain is a little rough so good walking shoes or sport sandals are a must and definitely pack a sizable bottle of water. The walk took us about 2.5hrs as we took it fairly easy and finished up with a late lunch at the beachside cafe at Big Wave Bay.

Walking up the Dragon's back is not only a great exercise and a great way to meet people on the trail, it is also an opportunity to discover great views of Hong Kong. It's a fantastic all-year activity, but best if you avoid Summer and the high temperatures as you may end up insolated."

The view of the Golf courses, Shek-O beach and South China Sea is beautiful. Recommendation - Just at the end of the ridge when the trail turns down to the Shek-O road, go further on the untrodden path. You'll find a huge rocks on the hillside where you can get the best view of the whole trail as well as Shek-O."

Don't forget the camera.The trail can be reached by the MTR at the Shau Kei Wan station then the bus number 9. You'll most likely see other hikers getting off at the stop to Shek O Road. Leaving the bus walk right and go up the stairs. At the top of the stairs veer right up a street and you should see the path trail marker on the right. The first portion of the trail at a normal walk will take about 2 hours. There are port o potty's at the start, middle and end of the trail.

Views of the rest of the island are ok - not the greatest, and the first half of the trail is shaded by foliage, which is welcome but means no view of the landscape - but you're not having to trudge up endless steep climbs.On holidays and weekends this trail can get very busy - if not hiking it in the week then it's best to do it as early as you can to avoid crowds, sunburn and dehydration - I'd aim to be at the start by 9am."

Make sure you stock up on drinks at the MTR station as there is no other place to replenish until you finish the hike. We took a taxi from outside Exit B of Chai Wan MTR station to To Tei Wan Village on Shek O Road (HK$50). This is the beginning of Stage 8 of the Hong Kong trail. It\u2019s a steep climb up from the bus stop to the ridge and the trail is well sign posted. Once you get up to the ridge, you can get excellent views over Shek O to the East, D\u2019Aguilar Peak to the South and the Stanley Peninsular and Tai Tam Bay to the West. You can also see Junk Bay and Tseung Kwan O. As you get to the top of Shek O Peak, you will also have good views over Big Wave Bay. On the day that we hiked the trail, it was about 25 degrees and quite busy. The hike is mainly dirt track and undulating and could be slippery in the rain. The ridge section is also exposed so make sure you take a hat, sun screen and plenty of water. If it\u2019s raining, make sure you take wet weather gear. After you drop down from Shek O Peak , the path heads at low level around Mount Collinson. This section is under the cover of trees and bamboo and the walk is relatively flat, crossing quite a few streams which were dry when we did the hike. If you do the hike from To Tei Wan Village, it is easy to curtail the hike if you\u2019ve had enough or continue the hike if you still have energy and water. Once you hit the concrete track near Tai Tam Gap, you can either turn left towards Tai Tam Gap (and civilization) or turn right and continue on the Hong Kong trail. This section of the hike is also relatively flat as you head around Mount Collinson. There are some nice views over Chai Wan and Lei Yue Muen. At the end of the concrete track (Pottinger Gap), you will have a few options for continuing the hike. You can either take a left and head down into Chai Wan, turn left and continue on the Hong Kong trail down into Big Wave Bay or take the Pottinger Peak Country Trail around Pottinger Peak. We chose the latter which follows a concrete catchwater. There are some nice glimpses of the D\u2019aguilar Peninsula through the bushes and you eventually get to another junction with a path for Big Wave Bay. You can get good views of the Shek O in the distance and the Dragon\u2019s Back ridgeline that you have just walked. Finally you descend some steep steps back onto Cape Collinson Road, from where it\u2019s a 2.2km walk back to Chai Wan MTR station.We took this walk at a leisurely pace and it took us just over 4 hours. However, you could probably do it quicker."

There are a number of options on this hike - we started at the Cape Collison Correctional Facility (on the left of Shek O Road, just after the roundabout) and walked to Big Wave Bay. It's about 7-8km and takes about 2-3 hours at a brisk pace. Alternatively, you could start halfway by getting off the bus/taxi about halfway down Shek-O Road, just after a car park on the right and with a toilet and concrete paving on the left, leading up to some stairs. Bring lots of water as there's nowhere to fill up and some protection from the sun as it's quite exposed. The hike takes you along the top of a north-south ridge so there's a decent climb up and climb down to start/end the hike and some up and down during, plus magnificent views either side - back to Tai Tam Harbour to the west and across to Big Wave Bay and the coastline on the west. Finish at one of the Big Wave Bay restaurants for some cheap beers and hearty local food, or head to Ben's Beach Bar on the back beach of Shek O to get away from the crowds at the main beach of Shek O."

Following the directions of other reviewers (MTR Shau Kei Wan take Bus #9 to Collison Cape OR MTR to Chai Wan and Bus #16... ask to be dropped off at the Sai Wan War Cemetery, and then hike up to the intersection... hang a left, and the park entrance is on your left), we set out this morning... it was hot and sunny, but well worth. When you get off the bus, you might want to double back to the intersection behind you, and visit the Chinese cemetery. As well, you might want to visit the Commonwealth War Cemetery, located just a wee bit further down the road. From the original bus stop, you will see a Park sign and markers indicating that the trail starts on your left. You'll begin walking up a set of stairs to a car park, then followed a paved road, until the cut off to the trail. The initial climb to the trail is steep but easy to climb with solid footings. Proceed along the trail (relatively flat, a few water crossings) and about 3 kilometers in, a cut off presents itself on your left. You can either a) take the cut off, and climb the steps to the top of the Dragon's Back or b) proceed on the original trail. Both come out at the same spot, though the Dragon's Back way, while more physically trying, is far more picturesque. The actual Dragon's Back is a series of peaks located in a line, so it's a bit of up and down. Frequent benches provide places to rest, and there was a great breeze at the top. Fantastic views of Stanley, and other beach towns. There were washrooms at either end, but make sure to take a lot of water with you.. it can be very warm there. It's a great HIKE, so don't expect a walk. Coming down on the peak, stairs are uneven, and I'd imagine in wet weather, slippery.Took us about 2 hours doing the Dragon's Back routing mentioned above."

The trail does end at a wonderful beach-so if you plan on taking a dip, start early to enjoy the sun. There plenty of great photo opportunities as you walk along the ridge of the mountains(dragon's back) as well as through some woods. You may want to bring some bug repellent as well just in case. I would definitely recommend this trail for those seeking a good workout and great views of Hong Kong."
