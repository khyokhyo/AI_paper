            "review": "Great trekking company. Absolutely faultless!. Outshine is a great company to do EBC trek with as well as many other treks all around Nepal. Nepalese owned and operated, very easy communication and organisation. From the time we arrived in Kathmandu we were looked after. All transfers and tours included. The first day was a great tour of Kathmandu - monkey temple, Crematorium, Kathmadu palace tours etc. very interesting. The trek was amazing, and our guide, Toby (Chhabi) was unreal - he looked after all our needs and was a great guy to trek with. Very knowledgeable and a real support for my wife and I (who are not experienced Trekkers). Everything was looked after and well organised. They ensured we had the best accomodation in all villages. Pream, our porter was amazing - took our two bags up and down the mountain and they were ready and waiting for us at every village we stayed at. A++++++ service and I couldn't recommend a better company to trek with. We will definately be going with them again for Langtan in the future!!!!"

I'm staying for a week - wanted to do trek up to Namche but was unsure of weather. Making a long story short - the hotel owners says he knows someone that knows more about Everest Base Camp trek and I'll invite him over for breakfast Saturday morning.We met Gokul at 11 a.m and within two hours I packed my bag, stored other stuff at Mi Casa and was in a van headed to airport to take a heli up to Lukla and start a five day trek up to Tengboche and back. It was nuts and once of the most memorable experiences - I'd say the most - of my two month solo journey around the world. Top notch guide, great service, good guest houses and special thanks to Pemba my guide. He would always tell me to \"take it easy\" on the way up - his word was \"distareh, Bret, distareh - take it easy, take it easy\". And I'd highly recommend Nepal - awesome people. Namaste!"

Since the first time I contact them, which is more than half a year from my schedule to Nepal, Gokul is always responsive and informative until the last minute. Even help us to exchange the rupees, buy water purified table, and so on so on. So do their team, Naba & Bikash who lead us along the trek. They always make sure we're on good & healthy condition, oh and patiently waiting for me who walk like a snail. Despite the altitude sickness and soaring leg I had when trekking, I really have a good time there. It's a great and memorable experience If i had a chance to visit Nepal again, i will contact them for sure. Oh actually i have a lot to say.So finally thank you Outshine!!"

Outshine is really trustable, from the time to pick us from Kathmandu till our last minute to Kathmandu airport was perfectly organized. At first when we see our guide I felt this child would guide us? After all at end we could not leave him as our parents. His care to his clients is outstanding. He was as flexible as we wish and manage to work in extras as we became aware of the options available. Lastly his inside knowledge and connections helped us do all this avoiding typical delays common to travel in Nepal. If you are traveling to Nepal, we highly recommend you to choose Outshine Adventure. They will care you better than your expectation."

I trusted them to organise and sort every detail of the trip, which I booked at quite short notice. They managed every curve ball (eg flights cancelled) and were very well connected along the way. I travelled by myself but at no point felt awkward about that.What a fantastic trip - and highly recommend the company to facilitate a similar experience for others."

We came back this time to do the Everest base camp trek and were not disappointed. Outshine continues to be the best trekking company with supreme service. It was nice to see Gokul again, and he arranged everything for us stress free. We were guided by Naba who was extremely attentive, funny, and who went above and beyond to make sure we were safe and enjoying yourselves. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect trek thanks to Outshine. If you're contemplating trekking Outshine will ensure your utmost satisfaction and safety, hands down. We'll be back for the Manaslu trek soon!"

            "review": "Superb Service with a Soul. After various inquiries with different tour operators, I finally decided to let Outshine Adventure handle my family's cultural & sightseeing tour of Nepal. The main reason is that the owner, Mr. Gokul Sapkota was quick to reply to my queries. Pricing was reasonable and he was able to offer all that we required- comfortable hotels, private vehicles with air-conditioning, knowledgeable guide & airport transfers. Had I asked for a helicopter in case I needed to be bailed out of altitude sickness, I'm sure he could have easily arranged it too. Okay, I'm going too far talking about altitude sickness. There's no such thing when just visiting UNESCO sites & looking at the Himalayas from a low hill, sipping organic Nepali tea if you please. To put it simply, Gokul is very resourceful & trustworthy.We arrived late at night with our flight delayed for an hour. I thought we could get out of the airport easily as we already filled out our Nepalese visa application online. But then, the airport carousel took so long to spew out the last luggage, with none of ours arriving. We got more delayed coming out of the airport because we had to file for baggage tracking. Anyway, after that arrival hiccup, we were quite happy to see the Outshine representative whose name I forgot meet us when we got out. He & the driver were very patient in waiting for us & i commend them for that. The following morning, we met up with Gokul in his office right in Thamel. He briefed us about our tour. We paid him the balance of our tour cost. He also helped us with currency exchange, giving us a much better rate than at the airport or elsewhere. He was very cordial & we felt assured that we could count on him.Siri, our guide for our day tours in Kathmandu, was knowledgeable, helpful & professional. We also felt safe with all the drivers. All the vehicles used were comfortable and bigger than the typical car in Nepal which can be quite tiny.Before we left Nepal, we had dinner with Gokul and met his beautiful young family. I'm so glad I went with Gokul & his Outshine Adventure team. You can easily see the passion he has to succeed as well as helping others.Overall, we felt safe & had a great time in Nepal. Do go if you haven't. I want to go back someday. Thank you, Gokul and Outshine Adventure team."

            "review": "Fantastic Tour Provider in Kathmandu!. Last December, I had a two week holiday planned with my girlfriend throughout Asia, with my first stop in Kathmandu. We arrived New Years eve, with the plan for the next few days to check out all the tourist sites ourselves. Well, a few days of travel from the states and having to switch hotels after one night left us a bit exhausted. We opted to utilize the services of a Tour Provider in the area. We found Gokul and Outshine Adventures here on Tripadvisor. Our hotel was only a 10 minute walk from the office, so we decided to go over and see what could be arranged for the next two days in Kathmandu. Even though it was last minute, Gokul put together an excellent itinerary with one of the best guides I've experienced during my travels! Gokul also advised against some of the items we were asking about (His thoughts were, the weather wasn't clear enough to see anything....he was totally right!)The driver and car were both great as well! I really can't say anything bad about the tours Gokul setup. The guide even helped us with buying some medicine at the pharmacy, and was very understanding when one of us was feeling a bit under the weather towards the end of the tour and just wanted to relax. (Sorry to the Thangka School we were touring at the time....the work was beautiful and If not for starting to not feel well, we definitely would have stayed longer and bought something!) Gokul even helped arrange our airport transfer back to the airport.The trip ended up being such an incredible experience, thanks in part to Gokul. If I find my way back to Nepal (which I very much hope I do!), I will absolutely be utilizing the services of Outshine Adventure. Thanks again for everything!"

We booked Outshine adventures on our first Nepal visit and Everest Panorama Trek on December 2014, after browsing and searching tons of Nepal tour operator in the web.We chose Outshine based on their outstanding performance from their previous guests , and we did not disappointed.Mr Bijay Rimal , and later Mr Gokul Sapkota , helped me with the arranging , planning and answering of our trekking related questions faithfully ,from the beginning (almost a year before our December trip).At first , we're concerned about trekking in the Himalayas in the middle of winter , bringing our 13 yo daughter, and none of us did ANY trekking before, but now ,Outshine Adventures proofed that this can be done, safely !Our tour only cost us USD 950 per person , with all the transportation ,lodging on the trek,basic daily foods,guide, porter, hotel whilst in Kathmandu , city tour , return tickets Kathmandu-Lukla, considered very cheap ,for the quality service they provided us.On arrival , they picked us up on time , and escorted to their office , where Mr.Gokul explained some options about the trek , considering the weather , Thank God we followed his advice on going early for the trek.On December , cannot predict the weather in any means, a day late , we would not made it to Lukla because of strong winds , and fog.We would like to thank our guide Roshan , a very experienced tour guide ,for his thoughts , guidance and expertise during the trek, we felt very safe with him. And Tendi Sherpa,our super porter, quiet guy ,with pleasant attitude.After the trek ,Mr Gokul presented us with a farewell dinner , and 3 Everest trekking certificates ,what a nice surprise !!Overall ,this would not be our last visit to Nepal, we would use Outshine Adventures again in our next visit !!"

            "review": "Outshine Adventures Really Shined When Things Went Wrong. I booked the UNESCO 5 days, 4 nights with Nagarkot tour with Outshine Adventures in early March 2015. I did so based on the many excellent TripAdvisor reviews. I was travelling with my 20 year old daughter who was living in India at the time. Gokul (the owner) was very responsive to emails prior to departure and was very clear about exactly what was included and what was not included in our tour package. We were very late coming out of the airport because of long visa lines and also because the airline had lost my luggage. I was worried the driver might not wait so long but he was waiting there with the sign even though we were well over an hour past our planned arrival. Our trip went exactly as planned. Our guide, Amit, was very friendly, knowledgeable, professional, and spoke very clear English. I was worried about our luggage, but Amit put us at ease, saying \"your worries are now my worries, so you can enjoy your visit\". He and Gokul took over all communication with the airport regarding my luggage and I indeed didn't have to worry about it at all. Amit delivered my luggage to the hotel soon after it arrived at the airport. This would have been very difficult for me to arrange by myself.Another major event happened during our visit. A Turkish airliner crash landed at the airport, which caused the airport to close for 4 days. Our outgoing flight to Varanasi India was cancelled and there was no indication when the airport would reopen. This is where Gokul's services really shined. He took us under his wing and informed us of several options we had of getting to India. We ended up booking an overland bus directly from Kathmandu to Varnasi. Gokul handled everything including buying the tickets, arranging for an extended stay at our hotel, and having a driver take us to the bus station and make sure we we got on the bus successfully. I don't know what we would have done without Gokul and Outshine Adventures. Through the whole trip, Gokul was always working in the background, ensuring we knew exactly what was next. He seemed to anticipate our every need before we even knew what we needed.I highly recommend Outshine Adventures for any trip to Nepal. You can rest assured that he will take care of you, even when things don't go as planned."

This is company is super highly recommended, i have booked my adventure with them 3 times within 3 years for a reason. Gokul is easy to communicate and he's reply is very prompt. He'll arrange for you with what ever u need as soon as u arrive at the airport until u go back to the airport to fly back. Price is very reasonable. and for me what matters most is the it's more than just business, there's soul in it. My friend left his phone in the car on the way back to the airport, while we left the Nepal, Gokul manage to save the phone and take the effort to post it back to us.So book with these guys now!Just in case u want to know which trek did i do: first was Nagarkot, second was Poon Hil, third was Khumjung via Lukla"

Aside from the trek, Gokul (the owner) arranged our accommodation and a day tour in Kathmandu. The accommodation was excellent as was the service we received from when we first booked the trip, during the trek and afterwards.Our guide during the trek, Naba, was fantastic. He gave us great advice and looked after us while I trudged and my husband bounced through the mountains. Unfortunately I had to be helivac'd from Dingbouche due to altitude sickness and even this was arranged seamlessly. The helicopter was there within an hour, I was picked up straight from the airport to the international hospital where I was met by Gokul who took care of everything for me, including arranging everything regarding our travel insurance.My husband finished the trek to Base Camp and came back with amazing photos and lots of great new friends. We had an absolutely fantastic time. I would not hesitate in recommending Outshine for any trips to Nepal."

SInce i did not have a local number there in kathmandu, my tour agent incharge of us, Arjun, took his own phone and called my airlines number in kathmandu and coordinated with them. Apparently outshine has quite an influence there. All in all, they aimed for customer satisfaction and to ensure our stay is pleasant. our guide even told us how certain things work in nepal and it saved us from being hustled from other Nepalese. if i do come back to nepal, definitely it will be sunshine =)"

I very much enjoyed the entire planning process and most importantly the actual delivery was above my expectations.For my private tours of Kathmandu Valley, I had a fantastic guide. Bijay took me to explore so many fascinating sites around the valley. Bijay was so friendly, welcoming and his English was extremely good. I would highly recommend scheduling private tours to explore the best of the Kathmandu Valley and I strongly suggest you do so with Outshine Adventure. My trekking expedition was also amazing as it was a private one. My guide and porter were both fantastic. One of the best moments of my entire \"round the world\" trip was when both Shankar and Nabarad sang to me a Nepalese song as we trekked our way through the forrest.

The communication with the company was very prompt and informative. The owner is a married couple and the wife Sabina seems to be the one who organizes the trips and kept in communication with us anytime we had a question. Everything was very seamless. The only thing we arranged was our flight in and out of Kathmandu, Exciting Nepal Treks took care of everything else in which there are a lot of logistics involved. I travel a lot and plan all my logistics myself, but the price seemed very competitive and based on the service for literally everything I'd pay again, rather than figure it all out myself. The hotel in Kathmandu is very nice and great location. It includes breakfast and wifi in which both are great. Our guide on the actual trek was named basu and he was outstanding. He really worked really hard to keep us happy. He is very personable, sincere, upbeat and always willing. I give my full endorsement to the company. Josh"

We initially touched base with 2 other companies, but finally settled on going with Exciting Nepal because of the detailed itinerary, immediate response to any questions, and wonderful reviews we read by others. We were not disappointed!We spent 1 night in Katmandu, then several hiking up to ABC. Our guides made the trip: Basu, Kapil, and Samon were wonderful--friendly, warm, informative, encouraging--everything you want along the trail! They were patient and accommodating-- very organized, reliable, and funny! It would not have been the same experience without these guys. We learned so much about their lives and the traditions of the Nepalese people from our time with them. Be ready to unplug, be dirty, and pack light--don't be afraid to ask what you should/shouldn't bring. Also, anything you may need for the trek will be available for purchase (for cheap) in Kathmandu.We were sad to say goodbye but I'm already thinking about going back someday for Everest Base camp-- I won't hesitate to go through Exciting Nepal!!"

We had a very joyful and relaxing time during our whole stay in Nepal thanks to the very reliable and helpful support of Subash, who oriented us whenever needed. We had the nicest Guide and Porter we could have imagined, thus we had a lot of fun together discoverng the Himalayas. The guide was very competent in informing us about peaks and mountains and villages. The choice of lodges was very good. The plan for the next day was always explained to us the evening before, so there would be no surprises of walking time etc. During the day the supervision was excellent. As a slow walker I did not feel rushed at all but very well accompanied. Subash kept in touch with us all the way long, providing us with information about routes and weathers. Accordingly, we felt very safe in the high altitude. Back in Kathmandu, Subash provided us with accomodation, a wide range of tourist information, and an unforgettable last dinner that became a very beautiful ending of our trip. We are two students in our mid twenties and we have absolutely nothing to complain. I warmly recommend Exciting Nepal to anyone who seeks a well guided adventure!"

Already while we were planning the trip, the company owner Subash answered all our questions really fast and in detail via email. So deciding for the right trek and getting everything organised was easy and fun! From the start, when we arrived in Kathmandu, till the end of our trip everything went perfectly well! Our guide Basu did an awesome job by always making sure that we were fine and happy, explaining everything to us and being very flexible about the route and our pace. During the trek Subash kept calling to make sure we were happy and everything was going well. This gave us a very good feeling of safety as we knew that if anything would happen someone in Kathmandu would feel responsible and be there with help and advice ASAP. Our porter was really friendly as well and did an amazing job! Back in Kathmandu Subash provided us with accomodation and tips about the city and was very helpful. On our last evening he invited us out to a typical nepali dinner which was the perfect end of our journey!All together we were very happy with Exciting Nepal! There is really nothing to complain about, everything went perfectly well and I can only recommend everyone to book with this great company!"

Before the trek, I was thinking about to cancel my trek like any other travelers, but the 50 % amount was already paid for our trek. We also receive suggestions from the company where we booked our trek (Exciting Nepal Treks and Expedition). The owner of the company, Subash himself was always replying and very quickly responding to all our emails and concerns. He assured us that 100 % amount will be refunded, if incase we would have to cancel our trek due to the broken trails resulting from the major earthquake. Our ticket was already booked and confirmed for Nepal and we heard the media spreading the news that Everest trail and many other trekking trails were fully destroyed. But that was NOT TRUE at all. We decided ourselves to fly to Nepal and self check then decide for the trek during our stay in Kathmandu.  Taking the suggestions of the company, we started our trek at the beginning of June. Guide Basudev from Exciting Nepal treks was extremely helpful throughout the journey. We hardly met 25 trekkers in our whole 14 days trek. The camp 'Phiriche' was affected and many tea houses were damaged. Even in Namche and Lukla, few tea houses were damaged in every camp. I met two trekkers on the way and they repeated to us that ( second time to the Everest Base camp ) they found all the trekking trails exactly the same as before and not even a single damaged was noted anywhere. We finished our trek successfully without any problem but many hoteliers and people from Khumbu were worried because the rest of the world was thinking that the trail of The Everest Base camp is destroyed. NOT TRUE. AS WE DID THE TREK BY OURSELF AND SAY IT IS SAFE AS BEFORE.Thank you Subash and the team of Exciting Nepal for helping us make our dreams come true even in such a critical situation. We will be back gain and join your company for the next trek. See you soon."

At all times during the trek and return to Pokhara we felt that we were at all times in the hands of caring professional trekking guides.

He is very attentive and very accommodating to the point he always ask if we are very happy with the tour so far. We started with a wonderful city tour of Kathmandu together with a very good driver and city tour guide and then a visit to Pokhara and Chitwon. We end the journey with a wonderful dinner overlooking the city before our flight back home.I can really say that the journey in Nepal would not be very memorable and that wonderful without the help from Exciting Nepal. If there would be a next time, I will go with them again."

While I was googling a bit, I found Exciting Nepal Treks and Expedition and soon emailed them for the information. As the name states, this agency made my trip very exciting and enjoyable. They gave me a very fast response of my queries via email which I had not expected. In fact I did emailed couple of other agencies as well but none of them was as quick as this one.As I booked my trip, I was a bit nervous if I had picked the right one but it certainly worth it. They have a very good collaboration of the trekking and tourism team. The guide was very knowledgeable and helpful. During my trekking to the Everset Base Camp and Annapurna Base Camp, I felt so relaxed and hilarious. The scenery was beautiful and unforgettable. It was an excellent value trip for me and would like recommend to everyone."

Dhurba was the manager in our hotel in Kathmandu.When we asked him to recommend a hotel in Nagarkot, not only did he suggest Hotel View Point such has superb views of the Langtang range, but he also advised that we trek ourselves from Nagarkot to Chagnu Narayan. We got a taxi from Kathmandu to Bhaktapur and spent most of day there walking around the old city before moving on spent watch sunset at Nagarkot. On the way our taxi driver pointed out the ridge on which we would be hiking to Changu Narayan the next day and advised that take the left road at Telkot -of the few points on the trek when we would be on the main road. The next morning we were fortunate that the skies were clear, which meant that we had amazing views of the Langtang range from the lookout at out hotel. After breakfast the four of us set out. The hike was estimated to take c. 3 hours, but it took up longer as we stopped to observe village life and take photos of the amazing scenery. If we were needed clarity on directions, where was always someone local who we could ask and they would point the way. That hike was one of the highlights of our trip. It was great to be able to go off on a trek by ourselves; we could go at our own pace and interact with the local people that we met along the way. Dhurba was spot-on with his recommendations - the hotel, the hike and the transport - all of which made our side-trip to Bhaktapur, Nagarkot and Changu Narayan most enjoyable."

As a female travelling by myself I was a little apprehensive until I met the team who made me feel safe and were able to provide a comfortable, well guided tour through the bustling streets of Kathmandu. The tour was well planned and my guide was very knowledgeable and able to answer all the questions that I had whilst undertaking the tour. The guide took me to some amazing vantage points to take some very nice photographs and the driver was able to amend the itinerary order based on the traffic and events of the day. The price was very reasonable and all expectations exceeded. Overall this was a great tour!"

This was my second trip to Nepal with Ace the Himalaya and I would wholeheartedly recommend using Ace as the tour organizer and guide service to anyone and everyone who visits the area. We had a small group (there were 7 of us) and were expertly led by our Head Guide, Santosh and his Assistant, Rupesh. Both were knowledgeable and extremely helpful to one and all. It was \"personal\" as both Santosh & Rupesh made us feel like a team and also like a family, of which they were a part! I consider them each my friends for life."

Our guide Kishore was so knowledgable of the area and spoke very well which made our experience that much better because we could ask questions and really learn from him. The culture, people, and overall experience was fantastic. There were definitely hard times but that was to be expected for this type of trip."

I was placed in a group of 4 and our guide Nirajan and porters Chandra and Gakul helped make it a wonderful experience. This was their first trekking assignment with ACE and I think they did a great job of handling the different personalities in our group and the different speed of the walkers. Nirajan's English is very good and although Chandra & Gakul's was limited, we still were able to communicate and they were a lot of fun to be with. Chandra was extremely helpful and on numerous occasions carried our bags to the accomodation and then walked back to carry our day packs also.The trek itself was great, beautiful scenery and diverse terrain, Nirajan tried to avoid walking on roads where possible. The accomodation in general was good It was always clean but sometimes a little too basic and we came to realise that just because a tea house claimed they had hot showers didn't necessarily mean the water was hot, or that they had water! Food was generally good, although with every place having the same menu, after 3 weeks, you're over it!!Wifi was available in most tea houses but limited in strength of signal.The Kathmandu city tour was very good, Dil our guide was extremely informative.I would highly recommend using ACE for any trek and thank you Nirajan, Chandra and Gakul for a wonderful time in Nepal, hopefully I will be back."

They're easy to communicate with - Sajiya and Kathy are very prompt to provide the info needed. My trek was EBC with Island Peak , 19 days plus I did a 3 day city tour . Prem Khatry owns and runs a great business, I had the pleasure of seeing him a couple of times , he's very involved with each and every group that signs up with his company. To take personal interest speaks volumes ! My trekking guide was Rajan Rokaha - Raj - what an amazing guy ! Beyond his knowledge, people skills , flexible and tactful , funny and caring , I felt like I was in the most capable hands trekking through the beautiful mountains! I'd book my next adventure based on his availability!! Oh , and had it not been for Raj I wouldn't have some fun and spectacular pictures from this trip !!! On my birthday he surprised me with a cake and made arrangements to get blessings from one of the Buddhist monks at Tengboche monastery .. Talk about going above and beyond! He's a top notch man !Surya was one of the porters - an absolute delight ! Both of them made sure that all is running smoothly more so during the tough parts of this trip. Pemba and Pema were at Island Peak and there's no denying the skills they have to take people up the mountain. Communication was less forthcoming than what I would've liked given that I'm a novice at technical climbs but this was one part of my trip. And Prem has found a solution to improve it , thank you Prem. Trekking in the Himalayas is difficult and AMAZING and it matters a great deal which company you choose to facilitate it ! Go Ace !!!!!! My city guide Dil is a well of knowledge and information about Nepal , its history, people , faith , philosophy! I learnt so much going around Kathmandu valley with him !He's easy going , very sweet and patient and he's enriched my knowledge a great deal ! I highly recommend Ace The Himalaya, they've made this an unforgettable, memorable experience for me ! Thank you Raj , Surya , Dil , Pemba, Pema , Sajiya and Prem !"

My first trip was in October 2014 on the Everest Base Camp Trek. The guides (Toya and Sunil) were very helpful and professional, it was an overall remarkable trip! The most recent trip I just returned from 2 weeks ago, was to Annapurna Base Camp. I was so impressed and pleased with booking with Ace The Himalaya before, there was no question that I would book with them again for this trek. Once again our guide Kamal was very professional and good at leading us and answering questions. Our porters were very friendly and pleasant as well. It's nice having local guides and porters so you really get to experience the culture and have competent people leading you. Since this second trip was after the earthquake I was curious how things in Nepal may have changed, but everything I saw and experienced with Ace The Himalaya was still first class and I felt very safe being in Nepal throughout the entire trip. I highly recommend this company to anyone!"

I was so attracted the great idea of combining volunteering and trekking that I decided to book it right there and then. The program not only delivered what it said it would on the website, it was bettered by the excellent guidance from our tour guide Raju whom I felt privileged to meet. Raju has been a fantastic tour guide in many ways. He always make sure we were well during volunteering and trekking. He triple checked that we never left anything in the hotel or guesthouses. He answered to all the questions - touristy or personal - we had for him. He put us at ease in every situation with great sense of humour. He sent me to airport and makes sure everything is OK. Throughout this trip, he became not just a tour guide but also a friend. Overall, I highly recommend this tour if you like to help rebuilding Nepal yet also enjoy a little bit of trekking and sightseeing. You'd get to see the beautiful places as Nepal is well known for, and also meet the beautiful people throughout the journey."

He was very personable and thoughtful, always checking in with my group to make sure our needs were met and we were having a good time. With any issues that came up, he was quick to address them himself straight to the source. I could absolutely count on him. My guide Rajan and his assistant guide Rabi were just spectacular. They were professional all the way, keeping us apprised of the trek and what to expect all the way. They were prepared for any issues that could possibly occur (which did!) My brother had altitude sickness and had to quit the trek. They came up with a plan to guide the rest of the team, along with getting mine and his belongings separated properly and carried them back and forth from where my brother had to stop and where the next guesthouse was. They were phenomenal in their care. I'm truly thankful for their care, their professionalism and their personable warm nature."

During the trek, Santosh and Dipesh never failed to entertain us with their humour, but more importantly they never stopped encouraging us to push harder until we reached our destinations. It was so amazing having such funny, sociable and knowledgeable guides, as they were able to answer many of the queries which we had. Although we didnt communicate much with our porters, they were always smiling, and never failed to help us out. Thank you santosh for making our trip to Nepal truly amazing, and always going the extra mile to help us in anyway possible. You were always attentive to the smallest details, and our trip wouldnt have been the same if not for you. You make us want to come back to Nepal to explore, and trek more.

From the start of the enquiry, I was asking alof of questions to Prem, the MD. He religiously answered each and every one of them with much patience. It was a first hand experience of dedication that I experienced. My guide for the trek was Nimesh Nepal and porter, Dipak Thamang. Nimesh is an excellent guide, and a better friend, who made us feel safe in his care all the time. We were 2 ladies, so trust and comfort were important to us when assessing a guide, whom we have to be with for the next 12 days. Nimesh is very mature for his age, and very interestingly, he is able to switch from a professional, serious guide, to a friend who could make us laugh with his silly jokes. The strenuous, long, trek over 12 days were spent playing catching and throwing snowballs, discussing life values, drawing portraits, dancing in the snow, and so much laughing. We enjoyed every moment. During the times when the whether wasn't too good, Nimesh switched to a seemingly serious, professional guide whom we can depend on for safety and navigation. He was also taking care of his porter, Dipak very well, ensuring his safety. Just like how a leader should be.Dipak is a young 20 year old porter, who has such strength. He speaks minimal English, so we don't converse much. However, for many times, he went beyond his duties as a porter, and took care of us ladies by catching us when we fall, and staying back to walk slowly with us, rather than just walking at his usual fast speed and porting the bags from point A to point B. The entire experience was life-changing, amazing, and I give 10 stars..heck even 100 stars, for such excellent service. Thank you Ace the Himalaya!!"

First over e-mail from Prem to whom I asked many questions; then from Sajiyah in the office when I started to get cold feet about the trip and she explained all of my options and the flexibility of the guides; and finally, and most importantly, from Krish, the main guide who stuck with me the entire trip, even though I was way behind everyone else, and gave me constant encouragement. It is really because of him that I made it. He made me feel welcome and belonging even though I worried all the time about my slowness. He was smart and funny as well."

We went white water rafting, bungee jumping, mountain biking, hiking.. basically anything that ended in \"ing\". They took excellent care of coordinating all the events. Nepal is not a super easy place to travel with traffic that is extremely unpredictable, but they were able to accommodate for all of us. Chris was our tour guide and he was very knowledgeable and took our requests for travel changes and suggestions. Only thing I would recommend is to bring a little mask to combat the pollution/dust."

We were paired with another couple that we absolutely loved and have become life-long friends with, and we cannot say enough amazing things about our guide, Suman. He went above and beyond every day to make sure we were comfortable, that all our many questions about the culture and areas we were in were answered, and that we were having the best time possible. And it worked! We plan to stay in touch with Suman as he is just a wonderful person in general, and hope we can come back to Nepal soon and try the Anna Purna Circuit with Ace and Suman! I also wanted to say that we met multiple like-minded trekkers along the way that we became friends with and compared our guides and companies, and without a doubt, Ace the Himalaya was the easiest to work with, offered the best prices, and they were so helpful getting everything set up for us both before and after the trek. Their whole team combined made what could have been a very complicated trip considering foreign travel, multiple groups, etc so organized and well managed.If you're looking for an adventurous trip with some of the most spectacular views in the world, a place to meet fantastic people, and a company that will help you do it- Ace is the place to go and Suman is the man to request!! You will not be disappointed with your trip- it's impossible, believe me!Crystal & NatMaine USA"

The whole experience was made easy because of them and their very caring staff. Our lead guide Santosh was amazing and took care of everything...I didn't have to worry about a thing. We started our trip with the rebuild program in Arupokhari where we helped with the early stages of the foundations. The work was hard but we all came together as a team and I found it to be one of the most rewarding things I have ever done. The cooks looked after us very well and ensured we were well fed...i celebrated my birthday on the rebuild and the cooks made me a birthday cake...a chocolate one at that! We left this amazing little village and went off to our next adventure which was our trek to Poon Hill...and all I can say is ...wow....words cannot express how fantastic it was. The scenery....the village life...even the numerous tea and guest houses we passed on our way up...and up we went! Santosh eased us all up there and when we finally got to Poon Hill we all sat in wonder....just magnificent. My whole experience in Nepal is hard to put into words but the mix of humanitarian work with a trek is a winner. I encourage anyone to do the 13 day rebuild and Annapurna trek with Ace. They just made everything so easy. I trust them which is why I have just booked the Everest Base Camp trek with them...I wouldnt do it with anyone else."

            "review": "Rebuild and Poon Hill Trek - Amazing Experience!. My partner and I just got back from our first trip to Nepal with Ace the Himalaya, and it was amazing. I would say it was a once in a life time trip, but we were so impressed with Nepal and our experience with Ace (our guide, Santosh, was the best!) we have decided we are going back in a few years. We chose the Rebuild-Poon Hill Trek program through Ace, since it felt like one of the best ways to give back to a community that was devastated by the 2015 earthquake. Arrival and departure at the airport were taken care of by Ace, making travel days less stressful. Our drivers to get to the village of Arupokhari were very skilled, both navigating Kathmandu traffic and on the 4 wheel drive roads to the village. In the village we were housed in a tented camp, with comfortable sleeping pads provided. All the meals cooked for us were excellent, and there was always plenty of food. The green beans, while one of the more simple dishes, was one of the most memorable (probably due to all the butter and garlic!). Everything was always very tasty. Our volunteering work was helping to clear and level the foundation of the house, followed by helping with the early stages of foundation building. It was hard work, but very rewarding. Life in the village was also a rewarding experience. I did get sick while in the village (rookie mistake, don't drink the \"safe drinking water\" in the 5 gallon jugs at the airport), and Santosh was an excellent caregiver. He took me to the medical center in Aarughat and the Dr there knew exactly what to do. I was out of commission for one day of volunteering, but thanks to Santosh's quick actions to getting me to the medical center it was only one day. The trekking to Poon Hill was an equally amazing experience. We lucked out with the first break in clouds in a few days, resulting in a sunset hike as opposed to sunrise.All in all, we had an wonderful time with Ace the Himalaya. Santosh, our assistant guide Dipesh(spelling), the porters, cooks, and drivers were all fantastic. 10/10 would recommend, and we will be booking with Ace again when we come back in a few years! Technical recommendations: bring 3 passport pictures with you... Ace needs 2 and the travel visa needs 1. Water purification tablets were needed on the trek, either bring from home (what we did) or be prepared to buy in Pokhara. Trekking poles are recommended, you can cheap but reliable ones in Kathmandu or Pokhara for 800 rupees."

I was picked up at the airport in Kathmandu from a staff of the company and was taken straight to the hotel without fuss and then to the office to be briefed about my trek which started the next day from Pokhara. Everything was well organized and my itinerary was well planned out and my flight to Pohkara was also arranged by the company. My guide and porter picked me up upon my arrival into Pokhara and everything went smoothly from there! The guide Nimesh and porter Dipak were the most amazing people- caring, helpful and constantly watchful over me. They were incredible in the knowledge of the mountains, the trails and culture and could answer all my questions with conviction. They stayed by my side while I kept a slow and steady pace as the terrain was rather challenging. The guesthouses chosen for me were clean and the rooms and food were of great quality. The uphill climb was quite demanding but my guide always made sure I was okay and checked on me all the time if I needed a break. Always patient and always with a great sense of humour too. I learnt so much about the the Nepalese culture from them. I am so pleased at the quality of staff provided by the company. The downhill was another difficult challenge but they were never far from me. The hotels provided by the company in Kathmandu and Pokhara were excellent too. I was very pleased with the choices and the rooms they put me in. I will definitely choose them again for my next trek which will be likely Annapurna Base Camp!"

They make sure that everything is taken care of no matter how short or long the trip, and ensure that tourists really get to know the real Nepal and see how much beauty it has to offer.Our guide, Santosh will forever remain a close friend that I stay in contact with, he became the newest member of our little group. He and the other guides made sure we were as comfortable as possible and enjoying everything around us. Seeing Nepal the way we did will be one of the highlights for the rest of my life, it was the most grandest of adventures and I would not change a single moment of it! I highly recommend Ace The Himalaya for anyone eager enough and adventurous enough to trek across this beautiful country, or be crazy like us and mountain bike it!"

The initial email correspondence was terrific; quick responses and informative advice. From aiport to hotel to mountain to airport, we received guidance throughout our entire twelve days in Nepal. We began with an excellent day trip around Kathmandu in a comfortable van and a fantastic guide named Dil. We felt very reassured after having a pre-trek meetig with Prem, the managing director, who went over the itinerary with us and answered our questions. The trek itself was incredible. We went with the 6-day trek through Annapurna. Despite our beginner-to-intermediate trekking ability, we were well taken care of and didn't feel pressured to walk at a pace we were uncomfortable with. Our guide, Kamal, made for fantastic company. He was very knowledgeable about the mountains and very helpful throughout the trek with everything from guidance through tricky terrain to recommending food. Similarly our porter was fantastic; very polite and made for good company. Overall we had an amazing experience with Ace the Himalaya and would recommend it to anyone considering a trek."

The guides are top notch, and the destination could not have been more welcoming. The team at Ace from cooks, to porters, to guides, to the home office made sure that everything was lined up and taken care of. They chose the coziest of tea houses, and arranged the tastiest of meals throughout. There may be many guide companies to choose from in Nepal, but I would never look at, or hesitate to recommend Ace over other companies after the experience that the Ace team provided. Hopefully you are lucky enough to get Santosh or Yem as your guide. If not, rest assured that Prem has staffed his company with a group of smart, fun, compassionate, dedicated individuals who will give you the best taste of Nepal, no matter what adventure you choose."

            "review": "Ace is the Place!. A group of 9 friends trekked to the Mt Everest Base Camp in January 2016. A lot of people questioned our sanity, Trekking in January, but the weather was perfect, mostly cloudless days and only one day of snow. There were few people of the trail so it was very peaceful and added to the feeling of being away from civilization. Temperatures were cold in the early morning and at night, but once the sun came out, it was near perfect temperature for hiking. Prem runs a well organized organization. His staff was right on time to pick us up at the airport. They were helpful in helping us find last minute gear and trekking items that we needed. I might add that EVERYTHING you need for a trek like this is available in the Thamel, tourist area at 25% to 50% of what you would pay in the states. It is all chinese copies of the originals, backpacks, coats, gloves, sleeping bags etc, available at a fraction of what I paid in the states. I realize that the quality may not be quite as good as the originals, but unless you are a professional trekker, save the money and help the Nepalese economy. If I were to do it all over, I would have arrived with only my broken in hiking boots and and empty suitcases. The amount I would have saved on gear, would have paid for my trek.Nepal is in a state of turmoil right now. It is surrounded on three sides by India and China (Tibet) on the north. Since the Earthquake, the high mountain pass from China into Nepal is closed. Nepal imports virtually everything from India. India does not approve of the new Nepalese constitution and with one of their political parties which is trying to be less reliant on India, so India has created a blockade on exports into Nepal. This has made gas, diesel and propane very difficult to obtain. There are lines two days long from people waiting to purchase 5 liters of gasoline for their scooters and motorcycles and 10 liters for their cars. If you need more gasoline, people are paying as much as $20 a gallon on the black market. It also created an electrical shortage, There were planned blackouts and we generally only had electricity for 10 or 12 hours a day. This makes for a difficult environment to live in or run a business. I am sure that this is a temporary issue and the two governments will work it out soon, but even operating under these difficult conditions, Ace The Himalaya, kept things running smoothly. It was business as usual, they got us out to our different side tours right on time, kept us well fell and absorbed all the additional operating expenses they were experiencing.All of the Ace team took great care of our group. The office staff was well organized and friendly, our guide Kumar and his assistant Kamal were great. They were true professionals/ They always had a smile on their faces and kept our group of 9 hikers with different skill and experience levels together.We had two 70 year old men in our group, they kept them at the right pace, helped them with their backpacks when needed and made sure that everyone made it to base camp. This is not an easy trek, it was much more demanding than any of us realized, but they helped us all make it to Base Camp.Our porters were amazing. I am still in awe, that these young men were carrying 70 to 90 pounds on their backs, up and down difficult terrain, always smiling! and they would beat us to our next stopping point to have lunch or dinner ready for us as soon as we got there. The trek was amazing!, The landscape and scenery were beyond description. I took thousands of pictures and I could not capture the complete beauty before my eyes. It must be experienced to comprehend. I simply cannot give these guys enough praise. If you have ever thought about visiting the Himalayas. DO IT! meet the great people of Nepal. Experience this diversity of cultures and religions. Help out these great people in their post earthquake time of need. Help bring in tourist money and give them the jobs they need to rebuild their lives and their Country. Do not think of using anyone else for your trek. Ace the Himalaya is a first class act. Book with them and be confident that you found the best. Experience the Himalayas! I have traveled a lot and this trip was an unforgettable, life changing experience."

Whilst i previously traveled with a friend and a small group to Everest Base Camp , I returned on this occasion with my teenage daughter , a close friend and his teenage son - a good number for trekking. As before we met several different people and groups along the way - so much fun and so interesting and entertaining ! Ace were as on my previous trip absolutely fantastic and professional. From the staff and management in Kathmandu to our wonderful guide Kumar, our trip was unforgettable . On our arrival in Kathmandu we were met by Ace and transferred to our hotel, the Gaju Suites which was clean and centrally located in Thamel. The rooftop bar/ restaurant is particularly good. We then transferred by minivan to Pokhara , a challenging 5 hour drive (!) and then after a night's stay to the Annapurna base camp trek for 9 days . The trek itself takes in some magnificent scenery, staying at little hotels/ tea house houses throughout. Best to be a vegetarian in the mountains :) It's hard to praise Ace and particularly our guide Kumar enough . The team make the trip to this amazing country so enjoyable and unforgettable . Whilst the trekking can be challenging its more than worthwhile and a visit to Nepal leaves a deep and lasting impression. I've no doubt that we will return to Nepal again soon and will most certainly trek again with the team from Ace . Many thanks to Prem , Kumar and our wonderful porters - Namaste !"

My wife and I undertook a trek to Everest Base Camp in December 2015 with Ace the Himalaya and we cannot recommend this tour company highly enough. From meeting our guide Madan upon our arrival to being returned back to the airport following our trek, we were attended to at every stage. We were taken to the company offices for a briefing of what to expect and to go over the itinerary where it was obvious that AtH were experts in this type of trek. We immediately felt confident and at ease that our trip would be a success at a time when we were a little nervous about our undertaking.We have to single out our guide Madan for particular thanks - his reassurance, patience and knowledge were invaluable to us and we left him after our trek with a heavy heart. Everything he did for us felt like it was done out of friendship, rather than as part of his role. Our porter Prakass was also a great addition to the group - he ferried our duffel bags to each teahouse we stayed at, effortlessly it seemed despite the incline of the hills we were climbing, and always with a smile on his face.This really was the holiday of a lifetime for us but it was made extra special by the excellent organisation of AtH but moreso because of the incredible service delivered by its staff. When we return to Nepal, we will definitely be using AtH as our tour operator and will request Madan to rejoin us on a trek.Many thanks to Prem and all his staff for an amazing trek."

I travelled in January after the earthquake, so it was just me and the guide, Sunil. Sunil and I were brothers: 40K of biking every day and a combination of resorts and tea houses gave me the full perspective of Nepalese lifestyle. The biking was followed up by a four hour drive to Chitwan, where another guide named Krishna led me on a day-long safari through Chitwan National Park. I also spent three nights in Kathmandu. I can't imagine getting more bang for my buck on a trip. Highly recommend."

As both a solo and first-time traveler to Nepal, I was not only concerned about just seeing the sights, but also about my safety, my health, getting around, and not making mistakes that would jeopardize my adventure. I could not speak highly enough of Ace and its staff. Kedar provided so much information about the history of Nepal, the people, the religions, and, of course, the sights we visited. He is such a sweet and patient man. He even guided me in my shopping excursions to purchase authentic and handmade mandalas, mala beads, and healing bowls. My trek on the EBC trail was amazing. Raj took care of everything including providing a hot water bottle for a particularly cold night. He was always \"protecting\" me (in terms of the food, water, and physical elements of the trek, not in others doing harm to me...that was never a concern) while he let me do my own thing and go at my own pace. I was able to sort of experience trekking on my own while having what felt like a guardian angel in sight. If you want company, he's there. If you want to walk alone, he lets you do that too. Great guide and all around good guy! I will use Ace again when I return!"

Ace so far has helped complete two homes for large families and we began the foundations for a third. It was hard work but the families in the village constantly offer food and drink, making you feel welcome. Ace also supplies delicious food (cooked by a very friendly chef named Pemba). And when all the hard work is done for the day, I played football with the kids when they were out of school. I decided to do this trip solo, make myself to meet new people, and the Ace guide brought me in like family. Santosh is an amazing guide and constantly is working to make sure everyone taken care of. The second half of the trip was trekking to poon hill, and again Santosh makes sure the lodge is friendly/accommodating. Of course for this portion we required porters to carry the heavier bags. Their names were Dipess and Rufess, both were always smiling and went as fast or slow as the group required. Overall I will recommend this trip to everyone. It's one thing to visit Nepal and trek, like most do. However with the addition of rebuilding homes you become more a part of their community and have a more fulfilling experience. Ace offers all this and the bonus of an excellent staff. This is a trip I will never forget"

I'm so glad that we did not give into fear and cancel or alter our trip. Everything worked out fine and the country is determined to keep a good level of service for tourism. We were met by a driver on our arrival to Kathmandu and that made the transition to the hotel very easy. The accommodations set up on this trip were clean and comfortable. Ace provided plenty of support during the trek. Our lead guide Kishore was so helpful, encouraging, and fun as he lead our group to the top. He had much to offer in terms of history and geography of the area. The porters that carried our gear were helpful and cheerful and were well treated by the company. Our gear arrived before us every day without fail. Everyone in our group made it successfully to Everest Base Camp including a 12 year old boy and an amazingly fit and accomplished 68 year old. The scenery on the trek was so beautiful, but I would definitely say that being part of this group made it infinitely more enjoyable. It's a great way to travel. Definitely check out Ace the Himalaya- you will a see a highly professional company run by local people who are invested in the community and are giving back and supporting areas in need across Nepal."

I saw some brilliant sights - from city monuments, to beautiful mountain scenery, to amazing monasteries. I'd like to really thank my guide Sunil who took great care of me through the tricky bits (and there were a few this time!) and was always looking to get me the best accommodation and make sure I was comfortable. And also to my porter Elsan who was always smiling. Together they made our time together a trip of a lifetime. Special mention must go to them, and Ace The Himalaya, for running the trip as planned despite the major fuel shortages across the country - the impromptu jeep trip that Sunil arranged was a 'memorable experience' . If you are looking for a trip in Nepal that is reliable, well organised with professional, friendly and knowledgeable staff, then you will not go wrong in choosing Ace The Himalaya."

Madan, our guide, is extremely knowledgeable (he's been doing this for around 15 years, first as a porter, then assistant guide, and now guide), constantly checked in to see how we were doing, laughed with us constantly, and was with us from the time we arrived at the airport until he escorted us back when we left (even though that was 2 days before and 3 days after the trek ended). Rabi, our assistant guide, is one of the kindest, gentlest souls I've ever met. He was the \"frontman\" in the group each day and worked to pace us, he waited on us hand and foot at the guesthouses even when we begged him to sit down and take a break, and he constantly worried about each and everyone of us (someone in the group got sick and was sleeping in his room and he went to the room to check on him and got his sleeping bag off the floor and wrapped him in it). Madan and Rabi will forever be cherished friends and thank god for facebook for allowing us to keep in touch. In addition, Ace the Himalayas, is hands down the best touring company I've ever used. I cannot imagine this trip without them coordinating every single detail. It went off without a single hitch, which is really tough to do when you're hiking to Everest Base Camp."

Yet they do not do justice to the splendour of taking it in with my own eyes. I am hooked now and hope to one day summit this mountain.My guide Ram was knowledgeable and friendly. His second in command Dep was an amazing mountaineer. It is a difficult trek, but their experience, constant attention and encouragement made it extremely enjoyable. They were highly competent and I had complete faith in them to keep us safe.If you are looking for 5 star accomodation this trip is not for you. But the accomodation was much better then I expected and the food was plentiful. After a long day of hiking the guides would not retire to have their meal. Instead they waited on us until they were sure that we had our fill and anything else that we desired. I have never been so well looked after.I thought we were lucky that we had such exceptional guides. But on the trek we met and hiked with two other groups that were also touring with Ace the Himalayas. Their guides were also friendly and, from all reports, just as amazing as our own.I was lucky enough to do this trek with some of my best friends. I witnessed my friends' proposal to his fiance, 5364 m above sea level.This trip has changed my life. I lost a dear friend prior to the trip. I started the trek stooped with the weight of the world on my shoulders. Each day as I climbed towards Everest, was like a balm on my soul. By the end of the trek I felt rejuvenated. Able to take on all my troubles, with a smile on my face, and my eyes firmly set to the heavens.You can not put a price on this. Yet I paid a minuscule amount. To say it was an absolute bargain is an understatement.Remember to tip the guides and porters at the end of your amazing trip guys. Pretty sure that you will all be extremely generous after the trip that they provide for you.Shout out to Ram, Dep and our Porters.Thanks for everythingQuang Tran"

He was irreplaceable in helping me every step of the way. Along with Santos my porter, (I think his name was Depwess?) was also a great sport, and both saved me from over doing it or feeling rushed, while keeping me laughing and educated on Nepali culture along the way. I simply cannot say enough good things about ACE.

The trip started with a 6 day biking tour up and around the Kathmandu Valley with our amazing guide, Santos! The biking was a combination of road/dirt/mountain bike trail/cobblestone that provided us with a fun trip that worked us hard! With the ever changing scenery I never found myself bored. We typically rode in the mornings and by mid/late afternoon we were relaxing at our hotel/resort/guesthouse and enjoying the views of the countryside. Santos was an excellent guide; he was not just a guide but quickly became part of our close knit travel group (total of four) and a great friend to have. He was well prepared when it came to bike problems and set a good pace for all of us so that no one was left behind, but no one was bored. If I were to go back I would definitely choose a trip that has Santos as the guide. He definitely enriched our experience with the company. After the Kathmandu Valley biking a driver brought us down to Chitwan National Park, where we spent two nights just outside the park at a resort. Here we were guided through a local town, took a walk through the jungle, saw the breeding grounds for the elephants, had a canoe ride down the river and enjoyed the views of the jungle from the top of an elephant! What an experience!Finally our trip came to a close back in Kathmandu where Ace the Himalaya drove us to the airport for our flight. Overall I had an amazing experience with Ace and would recommend it to anyone. Santos was the best guide that anyone could ask for, I hope to go back soon and do another adventure!"

Vehicles were clean and well maintained. Guide and driver were friendly and knowledgeable.Couple notes on our trip. I will give them 5 starts because our guide was great, however if we go back I would stay at a different hotel. It wasn't bad, but there was a very loud bar on the roof that kept us up the night in Katmandu.The hotel we stayed in when we went up into the hills was amazing. Great view and good food. This was our favorite part of the trip. If we go back, we'd stay up there for 2-3 nights and just relax.As far as the temples go, once you've seen 3-4 they all blend together. This isn't a knock on Ace, just a comment on being a tourist. In Europe, all the big churches look alike after a while. The same hold true for temples in Nepal.DON'T LET THE EARTHQUAKE SCARE YOU AWAY. Nepal is open for business and everything is fine. They are repairing, but that should not stop you from making the trip. Great food. An amazing country."

We ended up having two groups combined so we had a merry band of 11 travelers and 3 guides. Kumar I Kumar II (Sarosh) and Dipak were the most amazing hosts and friends. I can truly say that they have eyes in back of their heads corralling 11 excited, eager trekkers over the span of 2 weeks. They had our backs at all times and we did not have 1 problem with AMS or any other issues. The kept us going at the appropriate pace and always had a smile and a joke to keep our spirits up. They are a great team and its evident that Kumar has much experience and a great bond with the guides as well as our porters. I feel that our group developed a special bond with them that was hard to leave. I know that I plan to return and tell all of my friends about Ace..and to request our guides. I have to give special recognition to our tireless porters - we met up with them regularly along the route and they always were laughing and smiling. My porter - Bilgagi made me smile with his great attitude from morning to night. Mealtimes were very well organized and a special time to see the guides in action. They were attentive to our every need. I equate it to service at a very good restaurant. I would be looking around for the salt and turn my head and there was salt magically appearing lol (just one example). Dipak would even remember the meals and milkcoffe that I preferred every day! They had an eye on each one of us at all times and looking to attend to our every need. I even suspect that they distributed room keys with an eye for the photographers in the group who would have better views for late night photos :) I feel like I am gushing but they truly deserve it. They will work tirelessly to ensure that they do everything in their power to help and make you comfortable.

I communicated with Prem prior to leaving Australia and all my questions were answered promptly. We were collected from the airport by our guide, taken to our hotel and pre-trip meeting arrangements were advised. Ram was our guide and he is fabulous with many years experience of trekking to base camp. He is mature above his years (23). Any problems any of us had along the way were solved by Ram (there were 10 of us in our group). The day after we went to base camp I was affected by AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness) and needed to be airlifted back to Kathmandu to go to hospital. The evacuation was arranged by Prem and Ram and all went very smoothly and I arrived at the hospital in Kathmandu one hour from when I left the teahouse closest to base camp. When I was discharged from hospital we went on a 4 day/3 night tour to Chitwan National Park and again this tour went like clockwork - very enjoyable. I would highly recommend Ace the Himalayas for any trek or activity you were thinking of doing with them, especially if Ram is your guide."

Well organised from arrival Kathmandu to departure 12 days later. The guide Santosh was always courteous, knowledgable and spoke English well. We felt very comfortable under his guidance, particularly his adaptability to unusual situations that occurred always culminating in good outcomes. I look forward to a future Everest Base Camp trek with Santosh as the guide."

            "review": "Everest Base Camp Trek. First off, ACE is a very well organized outfitter. Correspondence was easy and Prem always responded in a timely manner. Never a delay in replies to my various questions prior to arrival in Nepal. Upon arrival, I met my guide who I have to say left me feeling uneasy as I was unable to communicate in English with him. His English was very limited and he couldn't understand the most basic of questions or inquiries. We went to the airport on the day we were to fly to Lukla and throughout the 6 hours we were there due to inability to fly as a result of weather, we barely interacted as he couldn't understand me. Knowing my safety during the trek was in his hands, I was uncomfortable and quite anxious as to how we were going to communicate if I ran into trouble on the mountain and had to communicate. Thankfully, we couldn't fly that day and as a solo traveler, I was added to a group the following day and had a different guide. My new guide was refreshing and spoke great English! Things were pretty chaotic at the airport waiting to board to Lukla and the group was split up on different planes. This was a bit stressful as we were expected just to meet up in Lukla. It all worked out but appeared a bit crazy and disorganized at the time. I do not believe this is the fault of ACE, just how things run at Kathmandu airport. Once in Lukla, the trek began and everything was great. The trek is quite exhausting and as compared to climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, I found it more difficult. Climbing many stairs as opposed to a trail/path. Many sections of stairs along trail especially through villages. Support along the trail was great and our guide was very very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the area. Each day we received a plan for the day as well as a pat on the back at the end of each day before dinner. Later on in the trek, I became quite ill. My guide followed my condition closely and the day before we arrived at base camp, I developed Pulmonary Edema and Pneumonia and had to be air lifted off the mountain. It was my decision to go down as I was so incredibly ill and honestly felt like I was at deaths door. I had wished that my guide had realized how sick I actually was earlier before my condition got so bad. The helicopter arrived and I boarded (alone) and was flown to another location on the mountain. I had no idea where I was and was ushered off the aircraft and left at a building without any further instruction. No one spoke English and when I asked why I was here and not off the mountain, I was just told to \"wait\". I had no idea why I was there and for how long. This was a bit unnerving. After approx 2 hours, I was flown to Kathmandu in another helicopter. I later found out that I was dropped off as the crew had to return up the mountain for another more life threatening rescue. I wish someone had been able to explain this to me at the time. Upon landing in Kathmandu, a vehicle pulled up to the helicopter and told me to get in. Driver had NO ID...did not identify himself as affiliated with ACE so I again, felt uneasy but got in the vehicle which thankfully transported me to an ambulance which took me to the hospital where I was treated. From when I landed in Kathmandu at the beginning of the trip to this point...no one has ID. It would of been helpful if employees of ACE has a badge with their picture and the ACE logo to assure clients that they were representatives of ACE and that they are in good hands. This is a strange country and getting in unidentified vehicles with people you don't recognize isn't ideal or advisable. My Doctor at the hospital was fabulous and the bed side manner of all the staff at the hospital was wonderful and better than that of my native country of Canada. The care was of high standard and very professional. I did not hear or see an ACE employee for most of my stay which at first upset me as I felt alone and lost and was very ill. I later found out that the Doctor prefers no visitors and this is why they weren't there. I wish I had been told this earlier. I did see them closer to the end of my stay and they brought me fresh fruit which was appreciated. If you want anything in hospital such as food/clean PJ's, towels etc... you must ask. Supplies are limited and these things will not be offered to you. You must be assertive. I had no trouble with billing. My insurance company and the hospital sorted everything out for me and there was no confusion in regards to charges etc...They did everything. All I did was sign the forms. It was seamless. ACE was very organized and transported me back to the hotel and returned me to the hospital for follow up upon the Doctors request. I was well taken care of throughout this scary ordeal and I commend ACE for taking good care of me. Overall, I loved my experience in the Himalayas and despite my trek ending early, it was a one in a lifetime adventure that I will never regret and always be thankful for experiencing!!! The Everest region is spectacular! Despite the few hiccups, I wouldn't hesitate to use ACE again should I return. It was evident my guide Krishore loved his job and I couldn't of had a friendlier more caring guide. I met some great people and the Nepali people are the kindest people I have ever met in my life and I've traveled to many countries in the world. Thank you ACE!!!"

We ended up in a small tour group of 5 plus tour guide Raj and a couple of porters. All the way Raj looked after us both ensuring we were well serviced at the tea houses but also for our wellbeing all the way along the trek. He was well equipped for any situation and had a wealth of experience and knowledge of the Khumbu Valley which ensured we learnt as much as possible along the way.I can't wait until my kids get to an age so I can do the trek with them and of course use Ace The Himalaya."

I am so thankful and felt lucky to have chosen the \"Ace The Himalaya\" to handle and managed my tour visit in Nepal, as i 'd say they are well organized in dealing with their client's needs and demands. It was my my first time visiting Nepal and i would definitely use them again on my next visit. I'd like to appreciate the assigned tour guide, Mr. Dil Tamang for his skills of knowing the history of Nepal as well as the cultures, his knowledge are in details and very well expressed. It was unfortunate for me to feel that, the time we were in Darbar Square, I was taking videos and pictures on those buildings/temples and asked him ignorantly this line, \"when was the last time does Nepal got experienced of having earthquake?\" then he looked at me wondrin why asking such rare question.. but he then answered \"our country is prone of earthquake and perhaps the strongest one was 1934's\" and i just obliviously shrugged off and resumed the tour. 23 April i left Nepal, just about 2days, a dreadful news has came to me about Ghorka's earthquake.. that made me goosebumps and called my friend rigth away.I was so thankful that his entire family were safe and wished that i could help those affected at least stronger than i wanted to..My great appreciation to the driver, MR. PRAKASH, (can't remember his last name) a very humble and attentive guy. He knows all the way and of being readiness all the time you require his assistance.\u200bFurthermore, if you wish to visit their country, I would definitely advice that Ace The Himalaya tour services can be the best choice ever, not only because of being professional, your needs and requirements can be absolutely be accommodated.I would say, everyone should try to have the Nepali tour experience at least once in a lifetime. See you there again ATH, on the next no time!\u200b--vinfrom Philippines"

Our team leader screened through dozens of companies and quotations down to Ace the Himalaya (Ace). The main confidence gripper was the response rate of Prem, the boss of Ace. Every email sent out was replied in a jiffy and our requests were very well accommodated.Next part in deciding if Ace is truly a reputable company, is its logistics and admin support. An example was when our plane arrived late by almost 6 hours because of bad weather resulting in a backlog of activities. One of them was equipment preparation. Staffs of Ace made this fuss free and was delivered right to our hotel lobby, warm sleeping bags and down jackets which many of us did not have prior to the trip, saving us from bitter cold nights up in the mountains.Last and most importantly, good companies like Ace have to depend on their competent guides and porters during the trek itself. I'll leave the reviews of the actual trek, terrain, food, lodgings, photos aside as they are pretty generic in other companies. My focus will be on the people of this company, the guides and porters. Our main guide Suman, assistant guide (Thirta Puri aka Raj) and porters made sure everything was hassle free. Suman's knowledge of the mountains and terrain is enormous enough to constantly keep me in awe. Coming from a society that takes things for granted and all things material. Suman's humbleness and also attitude to towards work and life sets an example for all of us in the group, never failing to cheer us up during the hardest of climbs. Through the journey, he has become more of a guide but a friend, a brother to me. Raj the assistant guide comes across as an energetic and knowledge hungry , he constantly ensures that the last person is well taken care of, never hesitating to relief us of extra baggage which might slow down the group. He is also very clear of the terrain and the different routes to take even though our itinerary has changed. And finally the porters, without a doubt, the champions among the crew. Lifting baggage of minimally 30Kg on their backs and ensuring our belongings are intact, in our rooms by the time we end our grueling day. Along the way, we hear stories of groups not being able to cross high passes because their porters were not willing to do so. Hearing this, we can only keep silent and appreciate our group of tenacious portersWithout Ace and its crew, our journey to EBC and back (thankful) will not be complete. Thank you Ace for making this trip a very memorable one :)"

Kumar, Madan, Raj, and Robbie all worked together to guide 24 people up the mountain despite the different abilities, ages, and personalities. From the moment they pick you up at the airport to the moment they drop you off after your stay, they make sure your every need is met. They have amazing attitudes and are just there to serve in their highest capacity. If I were crazy enough to ever do this trip again (which trust me I am not) I would book with this company without question!!! A trip this difficult would not be easy under the best of circumstances but they pulled if off as if it were easy.

He also had a great sense of humour & made everyone feel like they were in safe hands. Our head porter Rhobi was also fantastic; I honestly do not think that I have ever met such a caring individual. After hours of trekking this guy\u2019s first priority when arriving at a tea house was to make sure all of us were taken care of even to the point of bringing us our meals, amazing!Anyone thinking of doing the EBC trek should consider this company, the trek is no \u2018walk in the park\u2019 but you will be rewarded with what I consider to be the best scenery on the planet as well as memories that will last a lifetime!"

In early 2014, I jumped on the chance of crossing off #1 on my list to reach Everest BC. I found a great deal through theclymb.com for a 16 day Everest BC trek (other deals are available now as well). I saw that Ace the Himalaya was leading the tour and I did a quick research on the company. After seeing mostly, if not all, positive reviews, I felt confident in choosing to go with them and chose a March 2015 date. Knowing that I was going into this trip without knowing anyone, sense of security was very important to me, and Ace provided that. From the time I booked, Prem, the company's owner, was in constant contact with me to provide me with all the information I needed as well as answer any questions that I may have. For 16 days in Nepal, basically everything was set up for me. From the hotel in Kathmandu to all meals throughout the trek. My guild, Dev, and other members of the Ace staff were extremely professional, punctual, and friendly. Even if I did the trek on my own (luckily I was joined by two other people who I now consider friends), I would have felt really comfortable. The trek was the most difficult thing that I have ever done. Looking back on the trip, I am even more grateful to Ace and my guild, Dev, for my success (yes...I made it). Dev was knowledgeable, energetic, caring, and humorous. He provided interesting facts and figures throughout the hike to help keep us informed and educated. He was always smiling, which made us feel like we were in good hands. He was always aware about how we were feeling by constantly checking in with us, and adjusted the pace appropriately when things got tough. He was always making jokes and even did some magic to help ease our minds. All of these little things, I believe, ultimately gave me the best chance of success. All in all, you can choose many other options to try to get to Everest BC. You can choose to go solo or you can choose other tour companies. None of these will guarantee your success, and that is just a fact! What you should be looking for is the BEST chance at reaching your goal. For many of us, we only get one crack at this, and I believe that Ace the Himalaya and their staff are the best bet! I would highly recommend them to anyone. I am already thinking about a different trip with them in the near future."

Our experienced guide Deepak and our strong, kind porter/guide Resham provided impeccable serivce and help throughout the whole excursion and were always ready and willing to answer any of our queisotns be they about flora and fauna or more in-depth subjects such as local politics, religion, welfare etc. The walking up to the highest point of this trek - Poon Hill - is not particularly strenuous but there are a LOT of steps. People with weak knees might want to take some knee supports. We also recommend trekking sticks to help. However, there is plenty of time planned in to the excursion and no one need feel rushed or stressed at all. The food along the route was just great - we were advised to opt for vegetarian dishes which we did and enjoyed every single thing we had. To my personal taste, some of the dishes could have been a little spicier - and we were happy to find out that local chile sauce was available which one can add as one wishes. We also tried \"local wine\". This was a surprise indeed! It looks exactly like water - and tastes like some kind of schnapps. We shared one \"cup\" and didn't go back for seconds! Everything was extremely well planned by ACE but what I would really like to mention is the extremely competent guides. On the way up to the highest point of our trek, I felt extremely ill. Our porter/guide stayed with me whilst the rest of the party continued. After a little rest I was fine again but Reshams calm presence really did reassure me that if anything were seriously wrong, I was in good hands. His strength and compassion are very valuable assets to any trekkers in difficult at altitude. We travelled in winter and were extremely glad of the sleeping bags we took with us. The accomodation was basic but clean and comfortable - and everyone was extremely friendly. Toilet paper is not used by locals so you may want to take some with you. We also took disposable bags so as not to leave any tissue waste along the route. Littering is a problem - children beg for chocolates and then let the candy wrappers on the ground. Our guide hepled in explaining why dropping plastic etc is not good and we hope this problem will be addressed conscientiously by future trekkers. This excusion was an unforgettable experience and we will be back for more. ACE gets our full 5-star rating without any hesitation whatsoever. Absolutely 100% recomend this company from start to finish."

Our assistant guide, Kumar was very kind, helpful, and caring. The trek went very smoothly, they made sure nobody left behind nor got hurt. I fell on the slippery ice a couple times, Kris always helped me going through those slippery ice and so did Kumar. Our group was very well taken care.

Everything was very well organised starting the trek, including the option to hire down jackets and sleeping bags, I provided my own gear but was good to know I had the option. The guides were very friendly and gave plenty of information about where we were going, what we were seeing and were always smiling making plenty of jokes.The accommodation along the trekking was much better than what I was expecting and we were kept very well fed with a decent selection of meals to choose from. All up the trip was amazing and got to see some awesome places. The physical aspect of trekking wasn't overly demanding, it was still hard at certain points but going at a steady pace and breaking when needed there were no dramas."

During the trek you pass trekkers from all over the world and local Sherpa people who constantly greet you with a warm \"Namaste\". The views of the mountains along the whole way are beautiful that one must see for themselves to truly understand how magnificent they are! There were plenty of rest stops along the way, tea houses, and places to eat that had great tasting food. One thing I would advise is to not forget to bring your own toilet paper!

Everything was well organised even before the trip, with lists and instructions sent to me. We had a trip around some sites in Kathmandu Valley on Day 2 and Dil, the guide, had an amazing amount of knowledge and facts. It was a fantastic day with amazing places to see. The trek itself was (with the exception of my kids of course!) the best thing I've ever done. It was challenging, but all the more rewarding for that. Our guides, Raj and Deepak, were just the best. They became our mates very quickly, and I couldn't have asked to be with a better group of people, including Raj and Deepak. Raj kept us laughing throughout, even when we were a bit fed up (tired and cold), which we needed. I couldn't recommend this trip more. I will be going again!"

The company owner, Prem Khatry runs a sharp logistical show and we were fortunate to get a guide called \u2018\u2019Milan\u2019\u2019 who turned out to be a fantastic trekking companion with his perpetual buoyant attitude. Nothing phased him and his porters Krishna and Sandeep were always in attendance during meal times .Krishna deserves a special mention as he was a source of constant amusement with his offbeat manner. Then for the climb we had Pemba Sherpa and Karma Sherpa who really went out of their way in terribly cold conditions(refer to photos)to make sumptuous meals, although my appetite was dodgy at the best of times. I could\u2019nt fault them and found the whole experience professional .I can highly recommend Island Peak as a taster for anyone who wants to go further (up another mountain ..that is )and this is a good way to experience ice climbing with all the kit under trying conditions .Prem, to you and Milan ,thanks again .See u in a Spring time or 2 as were considering doing Mera Peak at arnd 6461 m as believe its beautiful and u hv great views of Ama Dablam ,Nuptse and Lhotse ..and then some .Or we might just aim high again and go for Peak 38 @7590m Till then Namaste"

Even our travel agent said to be careful as she had not heard of them.Well... from the time of booking, we felt a good connection. The owner, Prem, was so attentive to our questions and concerns. As our luggage allowance on the airline was 30kg, but our bags were 15kg we took over many school books, crayons, pens and supplies. Through Rotary Prem arranged for these to be delivered to an orphanage 7 hours away.When we got to Kathmandu we went to see Prem a couple of times, but he was always busy. We started to think of Prem as \"Charlie\" as in Charlies' Angels. We saw his staff, but never him.Anyway, the night before the trek he came to the hotel we were all booked at and briefed us on the trek. We finally met him!!The first day was a sightseeing tour of Kathmandu with Dill as a guide, who was wonderful - so passionate and knowledgeable about Nepal.We met our guide, Raj and our assistant guide, Dipak. Next day, it was on... on the 8 hour bus trip to Pokhara.During the trek, Raj, Dipak and the Porters were great. As we tended to be in the front half of our 16 pax group, we spent more time with Dipak (Raj was at the rear, herding the tail end).Once, my wife fell over on black perma-frost and hurt her hand. Dipak and Raj could not have been more attentive. From then on, Dipak made sure he was not far behind to help in case my wife needed any help.Ace the Himalayas is 7 years old and has grown from a small company created by Prem. Due to his work ethic and the great people he employs, we know that this business will grow bigger and better and we hope the same culture remains in the future.Thankyou Prem, Ray, Dipak and the porters for giving us such wonderful memories."

Finally, I made it this December. There were several places in Kathmandu which I put in my list as a must to see. Durbar Square was on the top of my list. This historical place is probably the most popular UNESCO World Heritage Site in Nepal. Amazing concentration of various temples in a relatively small area. The 3-roofed Taleju Temple is my favorite there. Try to allocate several hours for this place and, also, look around at the nearby streets. They are full of life which goes just outside... Another place in my list was Boudha Stupa, one of the largest in a world. Honestly, I wasn't much impressed by this particular attraction. However, the area around is charming, with a lot of restaurants and shops.

Boy, can Santosh spin round fast when he heard me take a wobbly!! He also made sure I was very warm at night by providing me with extra quilts at every overnight stay! Meals and every break on the trek were well organized ahead of time so no wasting time!I was a little angry towards the end of the first day, as the staircase was never ending and much tougher than anticipated, and when the staircase got more like a wall of a staircase, Santosh was there to organize a pony for me which has now become one of my best memories ever!

We had a wonderful trekking in Langtang: thanks to Manu and Raza, our guide and our porter, went higher than any mountain in Europe and most of all were introduced to the wonderful People of Nepal.When we were back in Kathmandu valley, Dil showed us sites so different from our culture and explained local religion, architecture, tradition.We were positively impressed by the professional and kind attitude of all Ace employees: they made us feel at home in this wonderful Country."

Our guide during our trek was amazing and whenever someone felt ill or was having trouble walking due to knee pain, he was with them every step of the way ensuring the safety of the individual. The food was great and plentiful and you can always switch it up from the recommended suggestions. I highly recommend this company and I highly recommend going to Nepal! It was a great vacation and any one who loves the outdoors will love trekking. I feel this is a great way to do the trek for couples, family, friends, and if you are solo there are plenty of people in the group to hangout with."

This is more fun than two 50 year old gals should ever have. The tour had 6 other people which was just the right size to get to know folks. Sharing these experiences with new friends was the best part of the trip. There was a great variety in the activities, whitewater rafting was fun and quite managable for novice paddlers given the level of the Trishuli River at the time. Paragliding in Pohkara was a favorite for most of our group.Accommodations varied widely from rustic mountain top inn, to a luxurious resort it Chitwan, all were comfortable and met expectations for their respective settings. The elephant ride in Chitwan was fun, but we didn't get very far into the forest and never saw any rhino's, whereas other guests who did the jeep tour did manage a sighting, so if Rhino spotting is a priority, you may want to conisder adding a jeep excursion. The only excursion that begged for some revision was the mountain biking. To get to anything that resembles a trail, you need to spend a fair amount of time navigating the streets and traffic of Kathmandu, which turns out to be far more exciting and treacherous than the bungee jumping. Our guide, Arjin, was very friendly and managed the group with a very laid back style. Overall, I had a great time and would recommend the trip to a friend. I do recommned adding a day or two at either end of the trip to allow for a bit more sightseeing in KTM."

Ace the Himalaya is a small tour operator owned by an ex porter. That prior experience has given the company a lot of insight about the business and it shows in several areas from the attention to detail, wonderful staff to the value for price.Every person I interacted with during my whole stay was exceptional. Our guide, Suman was the best host one could have in a foreign country. During the trek he explained all sorts of detail about the geography and history of the area, safety tips and I always felt he took great care of all of us in the group. One group member didn't acclimatize well and I witnessed how they worked diligently to get the person extracted and followed up after the hospital release. No one signs up expecting to get extracted but it's great to know that Ace will handle emergencies with dedication and responsibility. That's great service.The trek was simply amazing. I traveled with my girlfriend and got paired up with 6 other folks who were great friends. The trek pace was well planned to allow for acclimatisation. I'd say this trek requires a moderate fitness level (e.g. doing a long hike +10mi, +6h). The accommodations are some of the best available in the area without being luxurious. By that I mean clean, cozy and in most cases with the best view available. For example, our room in Tingboche overlooked Mt. Everest, amazing!Outside of the trek our trip included an excellent tour of Kathmandu and a delicious cultural dinner with dances. I can't wait to return to the Himalayas and when I do I'll definitely book it with Ace.P.S. If you stay at Hotel Access Nepal do yourself a favor and try the food from their restaurant, they are to die for."

From the moment I arrived I felt welcome and safe. Raj\u2019s caring, sensitivity to my needs, knowledge of Nepali culture, sense of humour and friendship were outstanding in every way. He checked in with me by direct question every evening to ask how things were going and to make sure I not only felt safe and comfortable and but also that my goals were being met. I am a freelance writer so Raj acted as my assistant, translator, and sometimes photographer, helping me to set up excellent interviews with some people who might have been otherwise inaccessible. He acted as a co-teacher while I was volunteering at Bhairabi Primary School in remote Ratmate, his home village, helping me to understand the children and get to know the head teacher and staff. He took me to visit his welcoming family several times (I got to taste fresh buffalo milk!), arranged for me to attend a village Hindu wedding (he explained the customs) and toured me to other remote schools in the area. Raj worked very long hours to make sure my trip went smoothly. He remained in good spirits and positive at all times. My accommodations, while rustic in some areas, and tenting in some, were always just right for the situation. Special kudos to my village cook Kamal, and porters Resham and Tika.

We got over Thorung-La pass without problems from altitude and without needing Diamox. We never felt they had anything but our best trip in mind. If I ever return to Nepal, I will definitely use Ace and request Santosh as our guide."

I couldn't imagine trekking with a better company or guide. Everything was taken care of for us once we arrived in Kathmandu. Ace ensured we did not have to do anything besides take in the sites. I recommend Ace the Himalaya to anyone wanting to trek in Nepal. I cannot say enough good things about this company and I can't wait to go on another trek with them soon!"

I met two of them since one picked me up at the airport and traveled with me to Chitwan while I had a different guide for trekking. Everyone I met was very friendly and helpful which really helped when arriving on my own. The trekking was amazing and a big part of that (aside from the truly amazing views) were our fun and wonderful guides and porters! While in Kathmandu we also ended up adding on a city temple tour and mountain biking. Overall, I would definitely recommend Ace the Himalya to others. The customer service of all the people involved will make sure you have a great experience!"

            "review": "Just got back. Terrific trip, highly recommended.. I went on the EBC trip advertised through the Clymb along with 10 other strangers, all ages, abilities and backgrounds. Some with high altitude experence, some not. We headed up on May 20 for a late season trip- advantage, warm weather in the lower areas, disadvantage, as with any mountain range, the chance of snow. And snow we got, two feet of it at Loubouche. Some opted to head up the mountain to EBC, many of us didn't (me included) and opted instead to rest, relax, shower up and wait for sun. Our guides Raj and Deepak were cheerful, competent and talented. Raj was full of good humor and laughter every day, and even when we faced the identical menu choices at every single stop we found a way to get fed and fortified. One accustoms to the icy rooms, because once you're on the trail you are greeted by what most people will only have photos of in their houses: massive great walls covered with snows, looming Everest and her sister peaks, a stately monastery and a chance to listen to prayer services in person. The snows against those blue skies are something else again. We even got to see the Everest marathon head down hill through the same snow that kept us from heading up!You must be prepared for the long uphills and downhills which are hard on the feet and shins, and relatively good shape is not the kind of shape to be in for this trek. This is serious walking. One of our group got very ill with ALS and was not taking Diomox and that is another very serious piece of advice. Don't come without out it and use it while you're here. Altitude sickness is nothing to be trifled with thinking that you're young and strong is a good way to get helicoptered off the mountain. Fitness is not a preventative. If I had one complaint, and this does not in any way reflect on Ace the Himalaya, it is the condition of the toilets on the mountain. Considering the masses of people going up and coming down, one would think that some kind of effort would be made to recirculate the sewage gas so that it is not such a constant and overwhelming companion to one's toiletries. At one point i was told \"this is the mountain.\" To a point I most certainly understand. But there are ways to pipe this horrific smell somewhere other than into one's bedroom (yes really)and we used outdoor toilets which utilized wood chips and other compost to great effect. As this is my third major climb, I remember that the Inca Trail suffered the same issue. Do not travel with out a great deal of toilet paper, no matter what, extremely good glacier glasses, and a huge sense of humor. Take an alternate pair of hiking boots, you will use them. Ace did all the rest, by making sure we were safe, happy, saw blooming rhododendrons and gorgeous scenery the envy of all our friends and took care of all the administrative details so that we were free to do all the hiking, walking, gawking and standing in wonder- and there's a great deal of that- we wanted. One last note: get to know your porter. Kopal lugged my oversized load (by about ten pounds or so) and I made sure that he got something special every morning to start his day. At the end of the trip we were talking and laughing and having a great deal of fun interacting, and I also made sure that he got a nice big fat extra tip for his effort. I really appreciated that he had extra to carry, and a Snickers bar stuck into the handle (or two) was definitely something he enjoyed. But he enjoyed the big tip at the end even more. What's key to enjoying this trip is to remember that the end goal is not the goal. As with trips like the Inca Trail, it's the journey, the EBC is really just a place. Kala Pattar was ultimately too dangerous to climb. But the chance to make way for yaks, walk across heart attack inducing suspension bridges, watch donkey trains head by, and marvel at the human train taking massive boxes of Pringles and coke up the mountain so that you and I can consume that in Gorek Shep, and being able to sit right behind the pilot as he comes in for a landing at Lukla which will decide for you once and for all to let your grey hair grow in, well, only here. The kids faces, the ancients saying Namaste, the excellent company of your group- that's the journey, not whether you made base camp. Prem started out as a porter, Raj our senior guide did too, and so did Deepak our assistant guide. They all know the mountain, the trails, the best views, and they want you have a magical time. They give back to the community, too. In all regards, an excellent operation all around. Strongly recommended."

We also enjoyed sight-seeing, experiencing Nepali culture and cuisine along with an elephant safari in Chitwan National Park! Prem was very helpful in answering all our questions before the trip and provided us with valuable information concerning arrival procedures and suggestions on necessary gear to make the trip more enjoyable. As experienced travelers, we usually book everything ourselves. Having Ace take care of the details was like having your own personal concierge service. They were professional, courteous and were very flexible, allowing you to \"tweak\" your itinerary and tailor your trip to your own personal tastes. I would recommend Prem and the staff at Ace to enjoy Nepal in a \"worry free\" environment.

This trip was amazing, Ace did a wonderful job putting this together and went out of their way to accommodate us with any changes we needed when possible. (Not to mention answering all the questions we had before booking the trip.) From the time they picked us up at the airport to the time they dropped us off 12 days later we never felt unsafe. The driver was absolutely wonderful, how he's able to drive through that was unreal - you have to see it to believe it! They had everything planned for us and we even had time to venture out on our own. This is the first guided tour group we have booked with mainly because we like time to do things on our own, Ace was perfect for that. We even stayed an extra day so we could take a flight over Everest and Prem even sat that up for us. The only thing we wished we had known was how CHEAP you can purchase trekking gear for in Kathmandu. We could have packed light, gone with no gear, bought it there and brought it home with us to use here. Of course we still bought gear, but the extra baggage cost was brutal. You can't go wrong with this group. How many vacations can you say you went white water rafting, hiked up Sarangkot and woke up to a breathe taking view of the Annapurna range, para glided off that same mountain, took an Elephant Safari, played with a baby elephant, biked Kathmandu, jumped off a 524' high bridge to a 328 ft free fall Canyon Swing and flew over The Himalayas to see Everest (not to mention all the cultural sights along the way) - all in one trip! You can have all this and more with Ace the Himalaya."

Once I arrived they informed me that other group participants changed their trekk so I was the only one in the group... Nevertheless they gave me a guide so I had a guide for my own without paying more! Furthermore they managed to give me a helicopter flight instead of a plane flight without paying more :) (Kathmandu to Lukla) All in all great experience with the Team!At the end a personal recomodation: Plan 1 or 2 extra days for the return... The flight back from Lukla to Kathmandu can be a total mess! The airlines there dont have a ticket system as people are used to... It might be that you are stuck in Lukla for some days which can be really bad if you know your plane home will fly on the next day...."

This was due to their ties to the local community in Arupokhari village district.I cannot recommend travelling with ACE strongly enough, their level of service is second to none, and the experience and wealth of knowledge presented by the guides and the company is exceptional."

I travelled to Nepal in a Univeristy trip with 9 others. Ace organised our sight-seeing in Kathmandu and Pokhara, our trek (the Annapurna Circuit) and most importantly our two week volunteering in a remote village in Gorkha.The most important thing with Ace that we found was they really looked after our group. Ace provided everything we needed for all of our activities, so the entire trip was completely stress free. Sight seeing was well organised with very knowledgable guides with great understanding of english.For the trekking, our guide became like a close friend who really looked after our needs. The porters they provided were cheery and very helpful, and the accommodation and food all previously organised. There were no complications so we could concentrate on the trek and not worry about where we were going to stay and what we were going to eat. They also gave us down jackets for free hire because of the cold and duffle bags for our belongings. The volunteering was also very well organised, with a chef accompanying us, and the guide was a local who helped integrate perfectly into village life.All together it was the perfect trip! Ace are highly, highly recommended!"

I signed up with a group of UNSW students for 2 weeks of teaching primary school students in the mountain village of Arupokhari, 5-8 hours from Kathmandu, and about a week of trekking, rafting and general touristing. Upon arrival at the village, the kids welcomed us with buckets of flowers, a tune of the national anthem and wide smiles that were extremely contagious. Despite their limited English and our even more limited Nepali, it wasn\u2019t long before they treated us like big siblings. Day 1 of teaching was challenging, as the kids are more shy than the average western student. But we soon grew in confidence and developed ways of engaging that will no doubt be useful for public speaking or in the workplace. I stayed in the family home of one student. The facilities are simple, but I had access to clean water and everything I needed. Most importantly, I woke up each morning to the world\u2019s best sweet milk tea, some nice conversation with the family, and a stunning view of paddy fields covered in clouds. We were fed with dal bhat, a traditional Nepali staple, and a collection of Indian-Western fusion dishes that tasted delicious. The village is generally clean as it is sparsely populated, and we all stayed healthy. Upon returning to Sydney, I deeply missed the days filled with purposeful trips to the school and making friends the old-fashioned way, without facebook, email and other things that we keep busy with. I might have taught them a little bit of English, but they taught me how to live happily from the inside out."

From the opening inquiry to final post-trek correspondance, Ace the Himalaya's customer service was prompt, helpful, and comprehensive. It was important to me to trek with a group and I ended up with just two other people and the guide. Prem let me know in advance how many people I'd be trekking with and answered a host of other last minute travel and tip questions. As for the trek itself, I got within two stops of Everest Base Camp (Dinboche - 14,800') and did not acclimate well. Apparently I'm a \"slow acclimatizer\" and needed more than the two nights we had to adjust to that altitude. At any rate, my guide, Bharat, arranged an alternate route back down to Namche Bazaar, thru villages we hadn't previously trekked up. At that point, one of the young porters, Binot, served as guide, too, and did a splendid job of it! He was cheerful and always helpful and the trek down took on a new, more introspective turn. It was actually my favorite part of the hike, stopping at Khumjung for the night, followed by a leisurely stroll adjacent to Shyangboche airstrip then a short hike back down to Namche where I reunited with my small group. I had a great travel experience using Ace the Himalaya and would recommend them without hesitation."

The customer service that Prem provided from afar was top notch. Even before we got there, we felt comfortable, well prepared and excited! And the service once we got there did not disappoint. We were picked up from the airport, taken to the hotel, given a tour of Kathmandu, Pokhara, etc. There was always someone there to help without feeling like they were hand holding us. And the trek was amazing!! Our guide, Suman, was the best - so warm and friendly, incredibly knowledgeable and helpful - just a lovely, wonderful person. Our porter Prassand also couldn't have been nicer (and was incredibly strong and fast to boot!) We felt so well taken care of the whole time. We were a bit slower than most trekkers, needing to go at our own pace, especially on the steep hills. Suman NEVER rushed us, and even helped set us at a nice, steady pace. We spoke to some people who were not happy with their guides - one woman felt uncomfortable by the way her guide looked at her (yikes!) I can't stress how important it is to feel safe and comfortable with your guide when on the trail, and Suman was top notch. It was truly a once in a lifetime trip and we couldn't have been happier to do it with Ace."

All accommodations and transportation in Nepal were taken care of, which took a lot of burden off of me. The trip started as a solo trip but I was paired up with another person that signed up for the same trip. I'm really glad it was more than just me on the trip, in Kathmandu I was taking in so much just seeing a culture so different from my own for the first time that I had no idea what questions to ask, the other person on the trip had a lots of questions and our guide was very knowledgeable and answered all of the questions. When we flew up to Lukla to start our trek to Everest base camp we got a different guide, Raj, who has more experience in the mountains. The pace of life up there was much slower and I had more time to take things in and start to ponder them. Raj was able to answer all of my questions and he makes some good jokes too. He kept things interesting, helped me pick food that wouldn't bother my stomach when I got a little sick after my water filter broke and always made sure we were having a good time. When we made our way out to base camp he pulled candy bars and other snacks out of his bag for us since there aren't any places to get food out there. In the evening he would meet with us and let us know what to expect as far as weather and amount of hiking for the next day. Overall the trip was excellent and I highly recommend Ace the Himalaya for anyone that wants to see Nepal, even if they've never traveled internationally before."

Hiking along the Kumbu Glacier with Nuptse towering is worth every second.Many thanks to everyone at Ace, especially my guide Raj and my porter Krishna, for making this trip possible. The pace they set for the elevation gain was perfect. Raj always answered my questions about which peak was which, why this or why that.

Weather disallowed the flight to Lukla and the planned Everest BC trek so we had to do a different itinerary. The ACE team made the transiton for us very quickly and very smoothly. We decided to change our destination to Annapurna around noon when we realized a flight to Lukla was impossible. They had us on a van to Pokhara that same evening to start the ABC trek with a new trip itinerary. Our trek guide Ganyu was experienced and knew what he was doing. He knows all parts of the trek like the back of his hand. He was fun to be around and knowledgably answered all of our questions. His team took care of all the little stuff and were courteous and friendly. That helped me to just enjoy the nature of Nepal and enjoy the company of the others on the trip. ACE seemed like a very organized company and I would recommend them for anyone looking to do a trip to Nepal. Since an honest review will also point out things that need improvement, here is what I say they can improve on. Charging for every cup of tea and coffee along the trek starts to get ridiculous. You sort of feel like you are getting nickle and dimed the whole way. I also had to wait for my pick up from the airport for more than an hour when I arrived.

With the cost, vacation time, physical, mental, and psychological challenges Everest creates a lot of barriers to overcome. I thought to myself if I cannot summit Mount Everest I would be satisfied with stepping foot on Everest. In 2011 I came across Ace the Himalaya and called up a buddy to see if he would like to share this experience of climbing Everest Base Camp. Prem the owner of Ace was very flexible, informative, and responded to each of my emails throughout the year until our dream came true in September of 2012. Although due to bad weather our dream was placed on hold, Ace the Himalaya provided us with an immediate backup plan....Annapurna Base Camp. At first I was very frustrated but knew that no one person can predict the weather and we needed to take advantage of something before we ran out of time. Most people come to Nepal to see the mesmerizing beauty of Everest, but I would highly encourage Annapurna Base Camp. Gyanu our lead guided was very knowledgable and spoke excellent english. My hat goes off to the porters. I'm always amazed how these guys who wear flipflops and throw 80-100lbs over their heads and climb up a mountain as though it's nothing is done with such ease. And for Dale our city tour guide to Bhaktapur Durbar Square, we couldn't ask for a better guided. The compassion and emotion he showed to his city was felt throught the history lesson he gave our group. The only suggestion I would give is train on the stairmaster, drink lots of water, and avoid buying thousands of dollars worth of gear. In Kathmandu there are stores every other building with cheap prices (this will save you lots of money if you're on a budget)."

The first thing was to find a reputable company. Like others we wanted to use a local company to try and keep the profits in Nepal. Ace the Himalaya had fantastic reviews Trip Advisor, and the rapid and courteous response from Prem confirmed that this was the tour group for us. We did some research and realised that the EBC track is really crowded and pretty much a long dirt track, so we decided to spice it up and go via Gokyo which was the BEST decision we made! The Gokyo scenery is amazing, seriously amazing, compared to the EBC trek (you come back down via EBC trek, so we so both ways). You come across people from time to time, but you feel like the whole universe is yours alone.Our guide, Raj, was an absolute champion. He knew all the ins-and-outs of dealing with any bureaucracy etc, and when we arrived early to Lukla on the way back, he somehow managed to get us two seats on a flight home when they were booked solid. Our porter, Gopal, was hilarious! He was a dead ringer for Marky-Mark (Mark Wahlberg) but the Nepalese version. He was strong as an ox and fast as a race-horse and always had a huge cheeky smile on his face. Both men took care of us at all times, particularly when crossing the Cho-La Pass, and on the morning of Kala Pattar. Those two days are really tough going. Up to 8 hour days in the freezing cold, and the altitude was pretty intense. It was just the four of us, so we felt like a fabulous little team (aka The Funky Bunch). The tea-houses are pretty simple, and increasingly so as you climb higher and higher. Electricity and hot showers disappear after Namche and the yak dung fires only got lit at about 530pm, so we were usually wearing everything we owned all at the same time. Again, Ace supplied great down jackets and down sleeping bags. That was another bonus of going via Gokyo... less people crowded together meant we didn't get the hallmark \"Khumbu\" chest cough. I can't express the beauty of the scenery of the entire trek. It's just overwhelming and it hits you right at the root of your soul. All the big mountains are stunning, but yes, something about Everest is frightening, grave and majestic at the same time. You start getting glimpses of Everest on about the second day of walking, and you'll never forget the first time you lay eyes on it. You will never forget this entire experience.Thanks to Raj, Gopal, Prem and the whole Ace Team. You might see us again very soon!"

What a fantastic experience, Gill and I spent just under 2 weeks teaching English and researching Ethnobotany with children at the Shree Bhairabi Primary School. Where to start? A big part of the experience was staying with Raj's (our guide and translator's) family. We were made so welcome, we indeed believed we were part of his family. The day's started early, 5am before the heat became too hot, school started at 10.00 and lasted to 3.30-4.00pm. The evenings were cooler, an opportunity to relax with a walk or even a swim in the river (and prepare the next lesson plans). There were some stunning views of distant ice covered mountains.Despite the heat the children were full of energy, they seemed to have learnt a lot of English by rote. Using creative games such as matching words using cards/pictures/removing word cards/hangman/miming all seemed new and went down well - lesson planning was essential!Part of our work was to record local plants recognised by locals for their medicinal value, we set a homework exercise with the children, asking them to seek information from their family elders. This was a mixed success, the children certainly had a good grasp of identifying local flora, but parents and grand parents had far more knowledge. We hope this initial work will be followed up. A very effective way of researching 'Ethnobotany' was to sit with a family elder using a Nepalise/Latin/English plant dictionary (available from Pilgrims book shop in Kathmandu - we also donated a copy to the village library). There just wasn't enough time to go right through the dictionary with enough people!I was really moved by the endearing friendliness of all the local people we met, the quality and delicious flavours of the local produce and cooking. The village had only been connected to the electricity grid for 2 years, like the water at the standing tap, the supply kept coming and going, people just cheerfully got on with life, working around these 'small' inconveniencies.As I said at the start; an amazing experience, I really want to go back, despite the levels of poverty, many aspects of this life style, often lost in the 'west' where community pull together to help one another, are really appealing. I hope this isn't lost as the nation develops."

Prem is a the very capable director of Ace the Himalaya who bent over backwards when the hiking gear of one of our group failed to arrive from Singapore. He tracked it down and had it sent to Pokhara the day before the trek started. The rest of the trip was hassle free. Prem is an inspiration with his Sambhav Foundation which is well worth supporting. Put it on your bucket list. Everyone should see the beautiful Himalaya mountains."

            "review": "Ace the Himalaya (Tibetan Cultural Tour). This was not my first trip to Nepal, but it was the first with my family. I was keen for my husband to love Nepal like I do and wanted to make sure that everything was pre-arranged, as we only had three weeks and were travelling with our daughters aged eight and ten. As I\u2019d already travelled to the areas of Nepal that we were going to, I thought it would be nice to also go somewhere new, so decided upon Tibet.I first contacted Prem when I was having significant difficulty organising the Tibet component of our trip through a Kathmandu-based company that also had an office in Sydney. In contrast, Prem was a delight to deal with. He answered questions promptly and provided exactly the information I needed. I wished I\u2019d also organised the Nepalese component of our trip through Prem.When we arrived in Kathmandu, Prem and his staff were terrific. Our Tibetan visas were organised with a minimum of fuss. The hotel that we had been booked us into (The Samsara Resort Hotel) was a little piece of calm within the hustle and bustle of Thamel.We thoroughly enjoyed the Tibetan Cultural Tour. Our guide Pasang Nodup and our driver Kelsang Wangdue were lovely. They were friendly, helpful and we always felt like we were in very safe hands. The vehicle was extremely comfortable. The monasteries we visited were incredible and Pasang gave us wonderful information on each. The Potala Palace was amazing ... difficult to describe in just a few words. The Tibetan countryside was rugged and beautiful and the people were truly lovely. So many of them wanted to spend time with our daughters. We were fortunate to have very clear days and so were afforded stunning views of the Himalayas including Everest. All of the hotels and guesthouses were very comfortable and well located. We enjoyed the authenticity of the guesthouses and we enjoyed the comfort of the hotels, so it was good to have a mix of each.It\u2019s certainly not an easy trip (the \u201cstrenuous\u201d rating became apparent when we were at altitude), but it was fabulous and we\u2019ll be reliving it through our memories and photos for a long time to come.Thank you so much to Prem and his team at Ace the Himalaya. It\u2019s always a leap of faith arranging a holiday from a different country, but I\u2019d thoroughly recommend Prem and his team. My husband was so impressed that he\u2019s already planning a return trip (he trying to decide between the cycling trips run in Tibet and Nepal, but I think Nepal\u2019s currently winning). I\u2019ll be returning to trek Upper Mustang. And while we\u2019re each off doing our adventure bit, the other will be trekking with our two daughters, who would return to Nepal and Tibet in a heartbeat."

Based on other positive reviews, I decided to go with them. Now I don't regret that decision because I had a wonderful time, and all because of Ace The Himalaya and their lovely guide, Arjun. Ace is a local company managed and run by local people. From what I gathered, they employ all local people and pay and treat them well. Remember not all touring companies in Nepal do that, they just want your money, but don't care for their employees. Ace made me have a wonderful experience. Prem was very quick and prompt in his email responses and was happy to respond to the silliest of my enquiries. A very patient man with excellent customer service focus. For Ace their customers come first and they will be ready to go to lengths to make sure their customers safe and well looked after.They employ an amazing group of guides and porters. I did the Everest base camp and Kala Patthar trip and my guide Arjun, a 23 year old boy, made sure that I had a wonderful time. A soft spoken and polite boy, Arjun, looks too young, but has the maturity to take the responsibility of his customers in the mountains. Through out my trek, Arjun was in the front and the Porter, Mohan, was at the back. They made sure I never slipped or took a wrong step. They don't push you, and give you all the freedom you want in the mountains, taking as many rest and photo stops as you want. Arjun took take care of me in every lodge, even bringing me hot water bowl in the mornings so that I could wash my face and teeth. Believe me, it is so cold up there that without that bowl of hot water I would be feeling pretty low through out the day.I even met a single Canadian lady doing her trek with a male guide from Ace. She mentioned that the guide was taking care of her so well that she did not feel uncomformtable even for a second, although being a solo woman traveller. Ace guides have a lot of respect for woman tourists.Overall, I can vouch for Ace the Himalaya and their guides and porters. I think their customer focus makes them stand apart. Even when things go wrong, like flight cancellations or weather delays, or your sickness, they don't complain and put the priority of their customers first.Well done Ace. Keep up your customer friendly focus, and thanks for my lovely trek up the mountains.I will be going back with them again in three years :-)."

We booked a private trip through Ace The Himalayas for just my husband and myself with a Guide and Porter. I found the trip on responsibletravel.com and after writing to all the Nepal trip providers I felt that Ace was the most helpful right from the first email. They were able to tailor the trip to fit our requirements and were good value in comparison to other providers. We had an amazing trip, our guide Raj (KC) and our porter 'Kancha' were great. I probably wouldn't have made it over the Thorung La pass without them, especially as I slipped and slid my way down the pass they were also there with a helpful hand to catch me! Raj and Kancha also both managed to look ridiculously stylish at all times, while my husband was doing his best impression of a ginger yeti by the end of the 3 weeks Raj was immaculately groomed everyday! We were pleased that they were both well equipped when so many other firms let their porters go over the pass in trainers and without proper cold weather gear.Raj always chose great guesthouses, not the most commercial ones, he seemed to be very well respected by all the guesthouse owners, my husband ended up in a volleyball match in Manang with Raj and Kancha and the chef from our hotel there. Kancha joined in our nightly card games and kept us entertained with his card tricks! He is training to be a guide and will be great at this, I would have no hesitation in returning with him as a guide. The trek itself was immensely enjoyable, the scenery is unmatchable. While the route is touristy we managed to avoid the crowds by going at the very beginning of March and Raj always chose guesthouses slightly away from the crowds and always found great lunch stops for Dal Bhat. We would definitely book again through Ace if we return to Nepal and given what an amazing time we had I think that's more a question of when not if!"

I had quick replies to my emails which was appreciated.I had arranged for airport pick-up so it was smooth getting to the hotel after long flights. The hotel they booked for me was nice, a bit out of the touristy area yet within walking distance. It was nice to know I could go to Ace while in Kathmandu if I needed something (although I didn't).On the first morning of the Everest Base Camp trek, the guide came to pick me up at the hotel. From there it was a fun adventure in the Himalayas. Gyanu, our guide, and Ressam, our porter, did an amazing job. We were only two on our group, so it was quite nice! I was able to ask many questions to the guide, about the culture, life in that region, etc. He was very knowledgeable. He also had our safety at heart, with yaks and dzos on the trail! I was the slowest one in our group of two, but I didn't feel pushed to go fast, we had a good system going... Sometimes the guide would walk with me when it was rougher, but sometimes he'd walk ahead and wait in some spots for me to join up. I didn't feel rushed, I took many great pictures. Gyanu also made sure we got good rooms in our lodges, with a nice view or not near the bathroom for example! They also thought us neat card games and chatted during evenings in the lodges main rooms. It was a great trip to Everest Base Camp thanks to Ace and their nice staff."

My wife and I volunteered to do some teacher training in the Dharapani school near Arughat in the Gorkha district in January 2012. Ace the Himalaya was responsible for taking care of us from the moment we arrived in Kathmandu until we left again two weeks later. This included transport to and from the airport, accommodation and a sight-seeing tour in Kathmandu, transport to and from the village in Gorkha, preparing the site and pitching tents and providing all our meals.The accommodation wasn't exactly 5-star (tents and sleeping bags) but the personal attention and willingness to please was. You only had to ask and it was done, even if that meant someone popping down to village a mere 600m below and back again. The meals were outstanding and all prepared in a tent with equipment carried onto the site.We enjoyed outrageous views, some of the friendliest people we've met anywhere in the world and at night, singing and dancing around open fires. Our two guides, Raj and Gyanu, were friendly, polite and ever willing to help. Nothing was a bother and their commitment to customer service had a genuineness that I've rarely experienced anywhere.If you're visiting the small villages in the more remote areas you will need a camera, both light and heavy clothing as the days can be warm but the evenings and mornings are cold in winter, a head-lamp, a supply of toilet paper, and water-purification tablets and hand-distinfectant as a sensible precaution. Nepal can be a little confronting if you are used to the ways of the west but some cultural tolerance, respect, and modesty in dress and behavoiur will ensure your visit is as enjoyable as ours was."

I can't think of a company who would take me through my journey across the Everest region better and safer. Not only I booked just one week in advance, but I was solo and physically completely unprepared for the challenges that laid ahead. In fact, I had no trekking experience whatsoever and that was supposed to be my first one. So I simply ignored the \"difficulty grade\" and thought that EBC+Gokyo Ri/Lakes+High Passes+climbing Island Peak would be more fun than doing something easier, and that I'll deal with the \"difficulties\" later. I had no clue. And that's probably what Prem, the Managing Director, thought when he saw me, cause he kindly offered to do amendments to my itinerary, should i decide to quit half way through, so I don't lose the payment. Needless to say, not only i didn't quit any way through, but successfully completed the whole itinerary crossing all the passes and reaching the summit of Island Peak (i'm not mentioning EBC because it was kiddy stuff comparing to the rest;)). And all that thanks to the Ace the Himalaya team! I can't thank enough to: - Baikuntha (a.k.a. BK or Bai), who managed to take me through the trek without a single glitch; who kept my spirits high with his good humor and encouragement; who calmed me down when i was freaking out (about AMS mainly:)); who helped me pack when i was late (which was every day:)); carried my backpack when i was too tired; taught me so much about Nepal when i was bored; and who became a dear friend by the end of the trek, and i wouldn't go to another one in Himalayas if it's not BK leading the way:)- Raj, who, i can only imagine, has super human powers, cause i can't explain in any other way how on the treks where i could barely carry myself, he managed to carry all my stuff, get to the lodge ahead of us, and then come back to see if any more help was needed! And all that with a great spirit and cheerful laugh. At one point, when crossing Cho La Pass, he actually pulled me up the hill cause i couldn't take any step further:) - Pemba, without whom i would never be standing on top of Island Peak (6189 m) with no prior climbing experience nor physical training; whose approach to the climb was so professional that I think he actually counted my breathing to set the pace that i could follow and the amount of breaks i need to take (so i don't pass out half way up on the mountain lol:)). He also made sure the climb was very safe, the equipment in top condition, and that i receive an adequate amount of training to know how to use it. - Kishor (a.k.a. Kris), who sorted out all pre-trip necessities in Kathmandu and helped with helicopter transfer when all the flights to Lukla were cancelled. - and of course to Prem, who gathered such a great team and without whom this company wouldn't exist. His management and problem solving skills are outstanding and he always follows up with the team to make sure each of the clients are safe and happy and everything goes well on the trek.I would definitely recommend this company if you're traveling to the Himalayan region. You know you'll be in good hands!"

Everything to do with the last minute switch went smoothly. The cars provided were always high quality with professional drivers. I never got stuck waiting anywhere and they were always extremely professional. I would highly recommend my guide Rabin and porter Myla.

I have just returned to Perth after spending the past four weeks in Tibet and Nepal that was arranged thru Ace the HimalayaAfter my initial three days in Kathmandu, we travelled by coach for 4 days into Tibet on the Friendship Highway to Lhasa where we spent 3 days looking at the sights.The most memorial was be seeing the Potala Place at night. If you get the chance to go to Lhasa you must make the effort to see the palace at night it was beautiful.I flew back to Kathmandu, then had a driver take me to the Temple Tiger Safari Lodge in the Chitwan National Park, where I spent three days. The accommodation was great and the staff friendly and helpful. We did see Elephants, Rhino\u2019s, deer, monkeys and crocodiles, But not any Tigers.On returning to Kathmandu we headed to the airport to start the 14 day Lukla, Gokyo Lake, Cho La Pass, Everest Base Camp return trek. Due to the weather our plane did not fly to we ended up taking a helicopter (great flight and being so low you see much more) to Surke, about two hours walk south of Lukla. Our first two days were damp and cold, but on the third day, the clouds cleared and we had fine weather for the rest of the trip. My guide for the trip was BK (Baikuntha Prasad Nepal) who is studying to be a teacher, so his English was very good and who had done this trip many times before and my porter Christian (Balkrishna Magyar) were both very helpful and at tentative.My goal had always been going to the Everest Base Camp after visiting Nepal some 30 plus years ago. We had trekked to Gokyo Lakes and the view was beautiful, especially with the light shimmering on the lake and the mountains behind when we climbed Gokyo Ri. All was going to plan other than me getting a chest infection the night before we climbed the Cho La Pass. That was hard, and took me 8 hours to complete with some assistance from both BK and Christian. What an achievement once we got to the top and cross the ice glacier. Now for the main goal of the trip. We reached Gorak Shep two days later and that same afternoon we headed for the Everest Base Camp. We saw glimpses of Everest on our three hour trek, and then we were there. The euphoria I got when I reached my goal was overwhelming. Photos, Video then the walk back to Gorak Shep, only took one half hours, but the sun was setting behind the mountains and it got cold. So cold that by the time I got back I could not feel my fingers as they were so cold and I had on two pairs of gloves. Must get better ones for my next trek.It had been getting colder the higher we climbed and most mornings part of my water bottle that I had in the room was generally frozen. The following morning in Gorak Shep the temperature inside the dining area was -4c and it must have been -10c to -15c outside. Although once the sun rose over the mountains it warmed up. We trekked back down thru the valley to Lukla and took the Yeti Airlines flight back to Kathmandu, then two days later flew back to Perth, WA.It was a fantastic journey, and one that that I had wanted to do for many years. Summary of trip;If someone said \"would you do the same trip again\", I would say \"no\" not unless I could be 30 years younger, although if challenged, would probably say \"yes\", but now there are other places and sites to see. What did I enjoy the most?\u2022 Seeing the Potala Place in Tibet both during the day and at night when all lit up\u2022 Catching the fist glimpses of Everest as we trekked towards it\u2022 Actually reaching my goal, the Everest Base Camp and having an enormous sense of achievement and overwhelming euphoria.\u2022 Likewise when taking off at the Tenzing-Hillary airport at Lukla and flying to Kathmandu, and again that sense of achievement. I've done it after all these years Some of the challenges that I had were;\u2022 Climbing Gokyo Ri at a height of 5360m then climbing down in the darkness and the freezing cold.\u2022 Trekking over the Cho La Pass at a height of 5330m With a chest infection and took 8 hours to complete.\u2022 The walk to Everest Base Camp at a height of 5364m was long and slow and satisfying, but it was the cold on the way back when I could not feel my fingers was worse. The food;I was very cautious on what I ate during the trip, and my general rule was that it had to be hot, and preferably vego. I had very little meat on the trip, especially once on the trek and no alcohol. Got used to eating Dal Bhat and lots of potatoes and eggs.The water;In Tibet and Kathmandu I purchased the local mineral water, but when trekking used the local water and added purification tablets. Suggested anybody else doing a similar trek consider purchasing a Permipen, a water sterilization device that sterilizes the water in 90 seconds and does not need any pills, just batteries, which are changes about every 50 litres.Washing;In Tibet there was generally always hot water available, but once on your trek, get used to washing in cold water as you have to purchase hot water for washing and showers, and sometimes they are not always hot as power is my way of solar panels. Accommodation;Whilst in Tibet, I ended up sharing a twin room with guy for Japan. It was difficult communicating with him as he spoke very limited English.Quite often we would have a room with ensuiteIn Kathmandu, I always had a twin/double room with an ensuite, and generally the condition was not bad.On the trek I always had my own twin room, so had plenty of room to lay out the clothes on the others bed. But these rooms were just a room, with twin beds, a thin mattress, a cover over the mattress and a blanket and pillow. I do not know how often the mattress covers, or blankets or pillows were washed, but it did not look like very often. I always used my sleeping bag liner and most nights my sleeping bag, then put the blanket, over it, plus the blanket from the other bed, so always nice and cozy.On the trek there was always a dining room in all of the lodges and they all had a pot belly fire that they stoked up as soon as the sun went down. Depending on the number of people in the lodge they either kept it going, or more often than not, by about 7.30 to 8.00pm that was it for the night and they let the fire go out, so it was always an early to bed.Toilets;I'm sure I could write a book about the different types of toilets we came across, some sit down, some crouch down, some just holes in the floor. But in essence you had to ALLWAYS, carry a roll of toilet paper with you and when finished place the paper in the nearby bucket/container, and get a tin/container of water and flush away what you had just done. Fellow travelers guides and porters;Generally there was always a \"Namaste, hi, hello, good morning or Bonjour\" on the trekking, although sometime nothing as the trekker was exhausted and reserving what breath they had.In the lodges everybody seemed to be quite friendly, and people seemed to get on well. Met different people from all parts of the world and they all had a story to tell of where they had come from, what they were doing and where they were going. Many, not just finishing the trek and going home but going to other countries to continue their travels. Health and Clothes;Unfortunately I got a chest infection and a fellow traveler gave me some antibiotics that helped. Think this was caused by a combination of the cold and the dust on the track. It has not rained for some time on the tracks and a combination of the Trekkers, porters and yaks, made the track very dusty. Had what I called was Himalaya/Everest cough.I ended up wearing a mask around the mouth for most of the trek, but even so, my throat got extremely sore thru breathing in the cold air all the time, and ended up drinking hot lemon or hot ginger with ginger or lots of sugar.Had no problem with the feet. Made sure that every day when we had finished trekking that I took the boots off and took out the insoles to dry, in the sun if possible, plus changing into a different pair of socks and slip on Crocs and wash the feet in cold water, not hot water! It is not good for them in hot water.I tried to rotate the clothes most days, as it is not always possible to put clean clothes on everydayLike always took some clothes that I did not wear and thought should have brought more of others. Cold hands was my biggest issue, even though I had three gloves, one I had purchased in Vietnam that were lined, and my hands got cold, I used a silk pair of gloves when the day had warmed up and added on top of this a pair of Gortex gloves that David and Tina loaned me, but even within both these, at times my fingers were freezing.For trekking I was always wearing a pair of thermal bottoms and tops so together with a pair of trousers, another top, plus quilted jacket, plus scarf, and one or two beanie hat was quite warm. The only thing is when I wore my Gortex jacket I purchased to keep both the water and wind out, I ended up beings wet on the inside from perspiration, but hey, I was warm. I remember taking the Gortex jacket off for lunch prior to reaching Namche Bazaar, and I was only wearing a thermal top underneath, and as soon as the top same off, there was steam rising from my thermal top.Suggest that anybody else doing this trek, if they haven't got all the clothes and kit, don't worry, buy them when you get to Kathmandu, there as you will have at least two days free prior to starting trekking. Just make sure you take and have worn in your own boots, and have a supply of undies, socks and thermals that you bring with you.Batteries;I was able to get my mobile phone and camera charged, but bear in mind that power on the trek is mostly Solar, especially the higher up you get. The higher you go the more expensive to charge I paid up to $5US per hour and then the battery was not fully charged. I took my iPad, and this was great for downloading the photos from the camera, plus was able to use the camera/video on the iPad, to film a 360 deg view of Everest Base camp, great. I also used the iPad for writing my daily notes, but I did have difficulty in getting it charged. I was only able to do this at Kathmandu at the hotel and at the Cho La Pass resort lodge at Dragnag, so other iPad users beware.Phone and Internet;In Tibet there was generally mobile reception but very little internet other than in the major cities, where the internet was censored by the Chinese In Kathmandu you can get mobile reception and the internet either at your hotel, or one of the many WIFI and internet shops and cafesOnce trekking, the mobile reception gets limited as does internet connection, which is more difficult the higher you get, although there is great mobile and internet connection at Gorak Shep, the last stop before the Everest Base Camp, so you can make the call and send the photos to say \u201chave been there\u201d, \u201chave done that\u201d, \u201chere is the photos\u201d.Thanks; To Prem the director of Ace the Himalaya for organising the trip, the guides, porters and guides who were so helpful and to my fellow travellers and trekers that I met on the trip to make it such a fabulous journey that I will not forget."

Great organisation, even when the weather was doing its best to keep us in Lukla. Prem was super-punctual and helpful with any queries leading up to the trip, making it an absolute breeze to get things ready.Milan, our guide, really felt a part of our group and not just there to show us the way. His wise words of wisdom helped us - everything from what to eat when at altitude to dealing expertly with potentially serious situations. Plus his patience, local knowledge and teaching us basic Nepali phrases - priceless! If we get the chance to go back, we'll seek him out not as a guide but as a dear old friend.The porters, too, were amazing. Amer (aka Som, aka 'Happy') and Hira were just quietly efficient in going about their business and unfailingly polite. It was humbling to see them perform their duties at the teahouses after lugging our heavy bags all day. Even with the disappointment of not being able to attempt Island Peak due to illness, the trip was certainly memorable and we had a blast. I've already recommended Ace to friends and will certainly go back to them for future trips."

I left with a few more. The Langtang trek was less physically demanding than walking in Everest region and much quieter. I felt at home, like I was walking in my backyard at times. The guys from Ace were super. Sangram was our driver and he was professional, reliable, polite, funny, and kind. I kept joking that I'd call him for a ride when I went back to Kathmandu and though it was a joke, I have no doubt he'd come through if I really needed a lift. Ganesh was our porter. He too, was very professional and efficient. He liked to be on the go and could always give us time checks and keep us on track- an important necessity when moving trekkers through terrain unfamiliar to them. He was also very sweet and consistently looking after us. After dinner each night, he would disappear for a few minutes, then return with a sliced apple or some orange wedges and though we didn't ask, we gratefully accepted the food. He took very good care of us in the guest houses and made sure we had what we needed. His charm and friendly spirit were also very refreshing and welcoming. He was both professionally attentive and responsible, but also extended his friendship and made us feel like we were important clients and friends at the same time.Rovin was our guide and he was great as well. He was my guide the last time I used Ace and I'll definitely ask for him next time too. He stayed right with me, even though I walked much slower than the others. He frequently checked in with me, made sure I felt good, and took pictures with me along the way. He was constantly aware of our surroundings, reading the land and weather, and always keeping safety and enjoyment as top priorities. He took care of the whole group, gave us lessons on language and culture in exchange for juggling and card game tutorials, and made the whole experience better. He pointed out landscape, livestock, and evidence of change on the way down that we didn't see going up. He went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and happy. He was the same consummate, enthusiastic and skilled guide this time, as he was the last. Rovin became a good friend on this trip. His strong work ethic and attention to detail of his clients' overall enjoyment were both resoundingly clear. His friendship was extremely valued and I hope to walk with him again. Prem, as a repeat performance as well- was extremely efficient in answering all our questions about the trip before we got to Nepal and was attentive to our needs while we were there. It's clear he's worked hard to make Ace the great company it is. I'd choose Ace again and hope to have the opportunity to do so in the future. They are a good outfit."

The efforts Raj made to ensure we got to see and do all that we wanted to was fantastic. We enjoyed having many laughs with Raj and the porters and the dinner table conversations whilst they took the time to teach us Nepali words each night.

While the guides were friendly, knowledgeable, and made it a point to ensure I was looked after; the driver in Nepal was the best value-add (Note: a tourist bus crashed and fell off a mountain). He always had a smile on his face, was a safe driver, and tried his best to explain a little \"off-the-beaten path\" aspects of Nepal. James and Prakrash were excellent guides. You'll do well to tour with either gents in Pokorha or Kathmandu. But be extra kind to the drivers. By the way, bungee jumping and white water rafting in Nepal should be on everyone's bucket list! Lhasa is not impressive; would recommend spending more time in Pokhra - especially after Chitwan National Park. Either way, you cannot go wrong using Ace the Himalaya."

I just returned from three weeks in Nepal, trekking in the Everest region with Ace the Himalaya.This was my second visit (after treks to Annapurna and Everest base camp back in 1993) and this time I was looking for a more comfortable trek, staying in some of the luxurious lodges that were built since my last visit.I contacted several agencies with top Tripadvisor ratings in Kathmandu and asked them to propose custom solo itineraries and accommodations for a trek to Gokyo Lakes and Everest base camp via the Cho La pass. While the total cost quoted by Ace was not the lowest (but at the lower end) I selected them because I felt in my email exchanges with Prem K Khatry, the managing director, that he understood best what type of experience I was looking for. We ended up selecting Everest Summit Lodges in Lukla, Monjo, Mende, and Pangboche, the Yeti Mountain Home in Namche (my favorite of the bunch), and the Everest View Hotel in Syangboche, in addition to \"best available\" accomodations at the higher elevations.All those lodges (as well as the amazing Dwarika's Hotel in Kathmandu) turned out to be great, well worth the extra cost to me. We settled on a relaxed schedule of 20 trekking days for the trip to optimize altitude acclimatization.Prem selected Rovin Sapkota as my guide for the trek and Rovin turned out to be just the prefect guide for me (and a really fun team with Santosh, my porter). Everything was taken care of, I never had to worry about a thing.I enjoy my trekking at a moderate pace (\"bistari bistari\") with a lot of stops to take photos, enjoy the view, read a book, relax - and Rovin was very patient and always in a great mood. He is also a very caring guide, which was particularly important because I caught a bad chest infection after a few days which ultimately prevented me from ascending above 4800m.Rovin took me to the rescue post in Machermo where I received treatment and antibiotics. This allowed me to reach the amazing Gokyo Lakes, and Rovin provided the advice I needed when the tough time came to decide to either tackle the high pass or descent. In coordination with the Ace office he was very flexible in rebooking my reservations on the way back to Lukla, making the trek a success in spite of having to cut the trip short by five days due to the bronchitis.After my return to Kathmandu Ace's Prakash Aryal provided an excellent day of temple visits and sightseeing in Kathmandu and Bhaktapur.All in all I fully recommend Ace the Himalaya for your Nepal trekking."

And our porter was hard-working to say the least-- I think our gear weighed as much as he did! The city tour after the trek (Kathmandu) was also a good value.  The only thing I'll add (nothing to do with Ace the Himalaya)-- it's a tough trail. We had climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro previously, and in our opinion, the trail to Everest Base camp was a LOT harder. Also, \"Globe Trekker\" has an excellent DVD on Nepal that covers the hike quite well. We're from the USA and our trip was in May, 2011."

Since I would be going alone, I decided to use a trekking company to organize the trip. I wanted to use a local company and environmental awareness was important to me, so I began with those things in mind and wound up finding Ace the Himalaya. From my very first inquiry about the trip, Prem was extremely professional and attentive to answering my questions. I sent him several messages before arriving in Kathmandu and he responded to each one thoroughly and quickly. A driver from Ace and one of the guides, Rovin met me at the airport at my arrival and brought me to my hotel. Rovin was friendly on the drive; we talked about the trip (I had questions about trekking during monsoon) and right away I knew we would get along and he would take good care of me while on the trail. I spent the next day with a different guide, Kedar traveling around Kathmandu Valley. Kedar was very nice and taught me a few words in Nepalese. For every place we visited, Kedar had lots to tell me about our surroundings. His stories were informative and entertaining and he went out of his way to teach me about Nepalese culture, while also making sure I was comfortable. We didn't have the best driver (there's some question about his name, but I understood it as Raz). Unfortunately, he left us waiting around for about 45 minutes. Kedar was very apologetic about the wait and said he would report it to keep it from happening again. We had no problems after that and got around just fine.The next morning, Rovin picked me up at the hotel and we caught our flight to Lukla, where we met our porter, Santos. Both Rovin and Santos were great hiking companions and since they each spoke a lot more English than I did Nepalese, we were able to easily communicate. They frequently checked in with me to make sure I felt good and had what I needed and I felt extremely safe and at ease while trekking with them. By day three, we were playing cards and board games and they felt more like friends than anything else. It was a lot of fun and I'm thankful I was with them especially because I was traveling alone and would have been bored on acclimatization days and evenings without their company. They both taught me a lot about the landscape and people of Nepal. Rovin especially, taught me a good amount of language. I was in very good hands and felt extremely well looked after. The trekking was incredible and I had a really good experience, mainly because of these two guys. They took care of everything; all I had to do was walk. Because it was monsoon season, we had clouds and rain and ended up stuck in Lukla for 4 days after the trek. I wasn't worried, since I had a few extra days before I had to go back to work. Plus, Rovin and I passed time playing cards and talking. I spent my last three days in Kathmandu, mostly in the company of Rovin. I did some things I wasn't expecting and went to a few beautiful places. Rovin became a friend and I hope we stay in touch. My trip wouldn't have been the same without him- he was an essential part of the experience for me, being both an excellent guide in the mountains and a great teacher elsewhere.Overall, Ace was a great company and I would definitely use them again. They have quality people working for them and can take care of customers' needs efficiently and economically."

Never would I have thought that coming to Nepal and volunteering would have been such a great experience, something that has definitely left me with a lasting impression and wanting to go back. This has been mainly due to the work and great service that Ace the Himalayas gave to me and my friends. Whether it was the tea in the morning to the hiking and treking to the volunteering efforts we conducted, Ace was always there to help and I never felt a moment where I was unsafe or unguided. The friendliness of the guides and all those involved was something that definitely impacted me. The constant song and dance, as well as the true concern they had for our well-being meant a great deal to me as it ensured we were properly cared for. The catering was excellent, with a hiking chef accompanying us, the food I recieved in such a remote area was truely outside my expectations. Overall I could not have asked for more from Ace, they were brilliant in their services and the friendliness and approachability of all members of the team was fantastic. It is hence that with no hesitation I give them a 5 star rating."

My fiance (after a proposal at Everest Base Camp :) ) and I have just returned from an amazing trip to see Everest with Ace the Himalaya. From the first moment we touched down in Kathmandu we were made to feel so welcome. We met Chris, our trekking guide, on our first evening and we given a full briefing on what was to come. From our first meeting Chris was professional, informative and very friendly. We looked set for a great trek! And we were no disappointed. The 12 days were just great fun. Chris was fantastic throughout. He looked after every member of our group with such care, always checking that we were feeling OK. Being at the back of the group for 99.9% of the time he also had to follow me for 12 days and despite the odd clash in music tastes (Chris liking the vengaboys, me not so much) he was a great trekking companion with a brilliant mix of banter, jokes and himalayan knowledge! He even managed to take a quick snap of the base camp proposal without us realising which is something that we will treasure for ever!Overall the trip was 10 out of 10. We could not have asked foranything more from Chris, Yim & our three porters. If anyone is looking to make the trek to Everest Base Camp in the future I can 100% recommend making the journey Ace the Himalaya and Chris. You would be mad not too!"

Ace helped me through a difficult visa problem in India and restructured my trip to account for a lost day as a result. They carried out a well planned comfortable itinerary with good lodgings and food for this style of trek. My guide Raj was very impressive, and paid great attention to my condition throughout the entire trip, coaching me when I needed that extra energy and resting when I didn't have it. He was well versed in recognizing signs of altitude sickeness, what foods to avoid, local customs, and attentive to my hydration status, yet was laid back enough for me to experience the Himalayas in my own style if I needed. I would strongly recommend this group to other trekkers. People I had encountered on the trip paid much more money and received treatment that appeared inferior to mine. Ask for Raj if you can as his style of guiding is probably the best you can ask for. Thanks guys for a great trip. Hope to see you again in the future. Definately one of the best experiences of my life."

            "review": "Everest Base Camp Trek with Ace - HIGHLY recommended. I just completed the Everest Base Camp Trek (16 day tour) with Ace the Himalayas and have nothing but praise for the company and it's guides. From the very beginning, the Director of Ace (Prem K. Khatry) was wonderful to work with. Every time we emailed him a question or concern, he responded immediately. In fact, I don't think I've ever gotten such personalized service from a tour company before.I was with a group of six (from the US, Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia) and we all arrived at different times. Ace picked all of us up at the airport and we were taken to the Hotel Tibet in Kathmandu, which is very nice and comfortable and a 15 minute walk to the tourist center of Thamel.On Day 2 of the tour, we had a city tour of Kathmandu with stops at the Bodhnath Stupa, Pashupatinath and Bhaktapur, which were all on my list of 'things to see' while in Nepal. Luckily, I could cross them all off my list without having to arrange my own transportation and guides. How convenient! Our guide that day, Prakash, was fantastic. He is clearly a wealth of information on Nepal!There were 14 people on our EBC Trek, we had 4 Ace guides and 7 porters. I cannot say enough about the level of service they provided. We were all at different fitness levels and there was always a guide at the front and back of the group to assist as needed. Several people had issues with altitude sickness, stomach upset, etc. and the guides were right on top of it. In fact, one morning I took an asprin because my knees were a bit sore, and one of our guides, Bharat, immediately asked if I was feeling ok and if I needed anything. It was nice to know that someone was looking out for us and making sure no one came down with any serious altitude issues. Our other guide, Raj (commonly known in our group as 'Dr. Raj') kept a close watch on my friends who were sick in bed (one with tonsilitis and the other with altitude issues). He checked in on them regularly and it is such a relief to know that you'll be taken care of even though you're far from home in a country you're not familiar with. You can't put a price tag on that kind of service.In addition, the guides were fun and very easy to get along with. At night, we stayed in basic teahouses and since it was cold outside and not a lot of things to do in these small villages, the guides played cards with us at night, taught us how to play Bagh Chal (a popular board game in Nepal) and chatted with us about our day.We were all thrilled to reach Everest Base Camp and after a celebration with tea and cookies, I was still wanting to go in further to walk around the tents. I have to give a big 'thank you' to Bharat for offering to take six of us on an additional 1 hour trek into base camp (on top of the 9 hours of trekking we'd already be doing that day). It was an experience I will remember forever. Bharat's work day was lengthened an additional hour, but it provided us with a once in a lifetime experience. Incredible.To me, one of the best things about about booking a trek with Ace is that you're supporting a local Nepali company. I was highly impressed with the level of service they offered and the amount of personal attention we received thoughout our experience. I don't think a company based in an outside country would be able to provide the same level of service. If I have the opportunity to return to Nepal (and I hope I do!) there's no doubt that I'll be booking another tour with Ace."

From the time they picked me up at the Airport to when they dropped me off 16 days later everything on the trip was professionally dealt with and delivered as stated on their website. The accomodation in Kathamandu was a 4 star hotel and the guest houses on the trek (from speaking to other guided trekkers) always seemed to be in the upper tier with respect to cleanliness and comfort. I even had my own shower in my room in some of the guesthouses. Robyn, my guide on the trek, was great and a pleasure to be with. He was very attentive, knowledgeable and always concerned with my well being. The porter, Santos, always stayed with us which was very convienent in case there was an unexpected change in the weather and I needed some other article of clothing. This was unlike many other porters who I observed that were several kilometers ahead of the guide and client. The tour of Kathmandu and surrounding area with Prakash on Day 2 was very imformative and an excellent introduction for a first time visitor (i.e. myself) to Nepalese culture. I had a minor issue with my visitor's visa for Nepal and Ace was more than helpful. Without hesitation Prakash took me on his motorbike to the Visitor Immigration Center in Kathamandu and straightened out the issue for me and insisted on no renumeration for his efforts. I hope to return to Nepal some time in the near future and Ace Himalaya would definitely be my first choice."

Our guide, Suman Thapa, is friendly and fun loving while taking care of every detail with professionalism and experience. He knew the area well and provided a wonderful experience. The trek is remarkable in beauty and in the people of the Khumu. Ace the Himalaya operates by taking care of the little details and doing those things that make it a great time- from organizing the flights, to lodging and meals and keeping an appropriate pace for their clients- it was top quality. As the trek went on I noticed the other trekkers and their guides and I understood that Suman was in a league of his own, other trekkers were envious of the experience he was providing us. I was also impressed with the cultural and environmental sensitivity that Suman displayed and the manner in which he educated us in these areas for the Khumu.This trek is spectacular- ideal if you have little time but want to experience the big mountains and have time in this part of Nepal. I strongly encourage trekkers to hire Ace the Himalaya for a good trek. This is particularly if you are a woman alone or a small group of women- Suman and Ace the Himalaya provided a respectful and safe experience that I recommend highly."

He was incredibly knowledgable about the area we were in (Lukla to Tengboche), the local history and culture, the wildlife, every peak and elevation, the list goes on. He also told us about other treks in Nepal as I expressed great interest. He was patient and kind. could go faster or slower depending on the hikers that day. was knowledgeable in the dangers of elevation & hypothermia, as well as sincere concern when one of us was sick. Was very flexible with the trip when sickness altered the plan without any hesitation or any indication of complications with same. He was a really great guide, oh and.... so incredibly invaluable in getting us to and from Lukla as airport announcements were completely unintelligeable in english and knowledge of the maneuverings in these airports was crucial! Having done this once, I would never go without a guide and preferrably this guide (Suman Thapa). Nepal was amaizing and yet we only tasted a drop in the bucket. Such amaizing views and such wounderful people! I can't wait to go back and hike several other trails. Nepal has SOOOO MANY giant mountains it's crazy! With all the glaciers, that means endless waterfalls, rivers and creeks! soooo much to see and do, and amaizing people everywhere you go! such industrious people!"

            "review": "\"The Trip of a Lifetime\". Walking in the Himalayas, through the beautiful valleys, crossing the bridges over the rivers, climbing the peaks, and simply immersing myself in the Sherpa culture, seeing their villages, their homes, and how they live, was truly the experience of a lifetime. Everything I saw and experienced resonated at a deep level in me. I will be thinking about this trip for a long time to come. And my guide, Rabin, although he could walk circles around me in the thin air, was always patient and waited for me to catch up. And he always took good care of me.In Kathmandu, I was treated to a wonderful tour of the city and the temples by Prakesh, another excellent guide who shared with me his extensive knowledge of the area and it's many points of interest.All in all, I can highly recommend Ace the Himalaya.Charlie WatkinsFountain HillsArizonaUSA"

Our guide Kisnor ( who answered to Chris) met us at the airport with a very new spotlessly clean vehicle and this set the scene. Chris and the other guides we met all spoke perfect English. They took us sightseeing in Kathmandu and helped us with local shopping.We camped in remote villages and met some of the beautiful gentle Nepali people and children who liked to practice their English . We also stayed in three different hotels and everything was well organised. The hotels were all located off the main street, quiet for sleeping and each one even had a garden. I doubt we could have found these on our own. The hotels were very clean, probably rated three star.The company specialises in treks but in the off season they can organise for small groups. we suggested the places we wanted to visit and they did everything else.Pokhara has two very good museums, one on the Himalaya including the tribes and expiditions and the other museum is on the Gurkha soldiers.Nepal is not a wealthy country and services such as garbage collection do not operate as in a country such as Australia. If you go there please consider what you carry in ( such as plastic containers) and try to carry the emplies out.My husband who travelled with me had been to Nepal in 1971, we don't plan to wait another 40 years to visit this spectacular country again."

Prem from Ace the Himalaya prepared the entire expedition and our meeting upon arrival in Kathmandu was as if we would know each other for many years.After moving to the Annapurna area, we met our staff and started hiking all the way to Annapurna base camp. The service during the hike was excellent. Food was delicious and the accommodations were of good standard. At the base camp we camped and started climbing towards the peak of Hiunchuli. Even if we couldn't reach the peak due to the weather conditions and to many avalanches, we had a fantastic time with great experiences, lot's of fun and insights into the Nepali culture.I highly recommend Ace the Himalaya as organisation for treks, climbs or other adventures. There are so many in Kathmandu and I'm glad I was looking for something special and found it!"

Meeting so many people from around the world and having interesting talks and funny evenings! Being teached by Suman and Pemba, my great guides, gave me a wonderful insight into the culture, land and people, how they live and so much more!In Pisang Village, Pemba, me and our team left the others - heading towards Pisang Peak! The days on the mountain were full of unforgetable moments! Just everything was fantastic... The steep hike up the slopes; the evenings and nights in the great VE25 tent; the food - that is soooo delicious, as no guesthouse could ever keep up with and I almost always ate ways too much - I just couln't stop with all these healthy & tasty veggies and the huge varieties of meals our cook prepared!And then, of course, the summit-day! Starting in the middle of the night, with headlamp and warm clothes, we headed up towards the top - and many hours later, the sun just has risen, we arrived at a surprisingly wind-calm summit!What a moment.... no words could ever describe!!!Pemba always let me feel very safe. He is a highly skillful climbing guide, handling every situation on the mountain!The tour never stopped with revealing new stunning views, moments of happiness and laughter.... adventures... and so much more!I thank Pemba, Suman, Prem and all the ACE-members for this unforgettable, unique experience...Your way of spoiling your clients is really outstanding!See you all very soon...Namaste!"

From day 1 our enquiries and booking was straightforward and prem in the office answered our emails by return. On arriving in Kathmandu we were whisked through the mayhem of traffic to our hotel and given good advice on where to eat if we wanted to go outwith the hotel.The following day we were taken round kathmandu to all the sights and the guide was excellent and very enthusiastic.We were met by our trekking guide Raj and taken to the airport for our flight to lukla which was amazing. From then on Raj looked after us, he knew everything about the area, knew the names and heights of every mountain we could spot! Yem our porter did a great job carrying our gear and was an all round really nice guy. We could not have asked for better service on the mountain and by the end of the trip we treated each other as friends. Our favourite part was climbing Gokyo Ri starting in the early hours, the view from the top was breathtaking. The few tips i would give are climb kalapathar in the afternoon when the sun is on everest and be meticulous in your hygeine especially your drinking water, we found the trip quite easy because we stayed healthy, people who didn't fell by the wayside. The reason we chose Ace was becuse they were a nepalese based company with good enviromental policys and we feel we made a great choice.Thanks Ace and your team."

I had an excellent guide who was fully commited to the trip and often offered side trips which others might not have bothered with. I made Base Camp and we climbed Kala Pattar at 5500m and had brilliant views of Everest and the sorrounding mountains as the sun rose.

            "review": "Everest Base Camp Trek with Ace The Himalaya. For the second consecutative year Ace The Himalaya has provided me with a wonderful vacation giving me memories which will surely last a lifetime. Last year was the Tibet-EBC land tour and this year the Nepal-EBC trek. The Nepal-EBC trek took 11 days to complete, starting at Lukla at 2800 metres we trekked 9 days to reach our high point, the top of the Kala Pattar ridge at 5600 metres. The first 2 days of the trek were very pleasant walking along the Dudh Kosh river through pine and rhododendron forests passing many farms, villages and guesthouses. along the way. The climb to Namche Bazaar on the 2nd day was the first test of the trek being a grueling 2 hr climb gaining 600 metres in altitude but the view from the town when arriving is spectacular.Namche Bazaar lies in natural amphitheatre like bowl in the side of the mountain at 3440 metres looking across at 6000 metres peaks. Climbing to the top of the hill behind Namche Bazaar you're rewarded with the first view of Everest, Nuptse, Lhotse and Ama Dablam to the north. Following an acclimatization day at Namche the trek resumed walking north to spend the night at Tenboche with it's wonderful monastery and views of Everest and Ama Dablam. As the trail heads north from Tenboche slowly gaining altitude the pine forests give way to shrubs and rocks and the thinning air becomes apparent as the pace gets a little slower. Two nights were spent at Dingboche at 4350 metres with a day trip up the Chhukung Valley for acclimatization. One of the highlights of the trek for me the mountain vistas walking up the Chhukung Valley in clear blue skies were truly remarkable with Lhotse and Nuptse looming like a giant wall to the north and Ama Dablam spiking the skies to the south.Leaving Dingboche the trail heads north to the mouth of the Khumbu Glacier and the landscape becomes desolate at the high altitude with huge boulders and snow and ice. The hike up the Khumbu Glacier to Everest Base Camp was an obvious highlight of the trek. Though Everest can't be seen being hidden behind the Nuptse ridge the views of Nuptse and Pumori and all the lesser peaks are breathtaking along with the rugged desolation of the area. After lunch at Gorak Shep we walked the last few kilometres to Base Camp at 5365 metres. After decades of reading and dreaming about the area it was truly an exhilarating feeling to finally make it.Early the next morning after staying the night at Gorak Shep we made the 2 hour climb up to the top of the Kala Pattar ridge. Truly the definitive highlight of the trek for me the climb seemed long and grueling with the pace being very slow at the high altitude but the view from the top made one forget the effort to get up there. Everest down to the South Col is in clear view and so close now. The Khumbu Glacier and Base Camp now seems far below and looking out and across at all the peaks and valleys of the area it seemed we were higher than the 5635 metre elevation on my GPS.The trek out back to Lukla seemed anticlimatic but it was sure nice to get back into thicker and warmer air and grab a hot shower at Namche Bazaar.Overall I would highly recommend the trek to anyone with an adventurous spirit. The scenery is spectacular, the Sherpa people always friendly and hospitable. The trail itself was exceptionally well maintained at the lower elevations and the guesthouses we stayed at though often fairly crude and basic in accomadation were always clean and comfortable. It's hard work to make it through compounded by the thin air of the high altitude and one must be in moderately good shape with good endurance. For those of us whose age is advancing (I'm 53 yrs now) it's certainly do-able. There appeared many of us in their 50's and 60's along the trail.I can't thank Prem Khatri and his staff at Ace The Himalya enough for the organization, execution, courtesy and professionalism on all aspects of the trip. Ace always make you feel that they truly care and takes pride in providing the customer with all his needs to make his vacation a truly wonderful and unforgetable experience. Special thanks to trekking guides Bharat Adhikavi and Dhurba for their knowledge, patience, good humour and stamina. Both wonderful companions to have on such a trek making the entire adventure such a carefree and enjoyable experience. A special thanks to the three porters whose stamina and strength were truly remarkable and without whom the trek wouldn't of been possible. And finally a special thanks to city guide Prakash Aryal whose knowledge of local history and customs were truly impressive, which combined with his good humour and friendliness made the Kathmandu tour a perfect start to the vacation. Without the slightest doubt I would strongly recommend Ace The Himalayas for anyone considering traveling through the Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan region."

At no time did we feel abandoned or alone. The Unique Path Team only had a focus on us and our safety. They coordinated and ensured our party members who needed emergency evacuation were looked after and greeted as they arrived in Kathmandu. And for the rest of our party, we were guided professionally down from the mountain.Babu and his professional team put their own personal dramas aside to ensure that we were all delivered saftey home.Thank you Unique Path.

My friends and I wanted a highly rated guide service and also one who was responsive and answered our questions. Doing a huge trip of a lifetime like this and trusting someone you have not met in person or have a friend / relative to vouch for requires a certain level of \"testing\" the owners by asking whatever questions concern you and will allow you to make a choice based on a level of perceived trust. Babu was completely responsive, patient, and provided the best possible \"pre trip\" experience we could have even asked for. Once we arrived in Nepal, we met with both Babu and our guide Sonam. They both helped make sure we were ready to go and had all of our questions answered for the path ahead. Moving to the \"during the trip\" experience, Sonam made sure every day that we understood what the plan was, how much water we should drink, what we should eat along the way (including what we should NOT eat or drink!), and worked with us given the different pace of those in our group."

When we finally made the commitment and started planning one of the major decisions was whether to trek on our own or with a guide. We chose a guide and porter as we also chose a long (15 day) trek. Unique Path had very good to excellent reviews in our research and they lived up to those reviews. We built in extra days in our planned itinerary and that was a very good thing as well. I suffered from gastro problems 2 days into the trek which slowed us and hiking at high altitude has it's challenges as well. We used our extra days to slow our ascent to stay within the recommended altitude gain recommendations. Something we would caution other trekkers to do as altitude sickness is no fun and climbing to fast can void your travel insurance should you need help.Fantastic experience in a country of wonderful people and spectacular mountains. Unique Path adapted our trip plan to meet our needs and wishes, they were very flexible and accommodating. We could not have completed the long trek without our guides help and our amazing porter to shoulder a significant amount of gear. It allowed us to trek with lighter loads and enjoy the experience more.So do your homework, come prepared and do not hesitate to contact Unique Path for help. They are a great choice for planning and carrying out any trek in Nepal. Highly recommended!!Cheers,David & Karen"

I did a lot of research and chose Unique Path Trekking & Expedition. It was deeply satisfying to support this Nepalese company. I had an amazing guide and porters... and the experience was amazing. Because of my experience on this trek, I also made a last minute decision to visit Chitwan National Park, which was equally memorable. Wonderful people to deal with. If I ever get another opportunity to visit this fabulous country, I would not hesitate to book with Unique Path Trekking & Expedition again."

My guide/porter, Sambhu, was adorable and he was my guardian angel for 14 days up in the mountains - absolutely great service!

But I was convinced that I wanted to support locals instead of booking at an agency in Germany. And my bravery was rewarded thousand times. The team of Unique Paths is so delightful, experienced and nice. They get my highest appraisals. They hire locals only. And get them insurance and treat them super fair. Which you will rarely find in the Himalayas where thousands of tourists travel with agencies that don't insure the sherpas or guides, let them schlepp way too much weight and make them stay in worse housing than their guests! Not with UP. They are fair all the way. The hotel they put us in was the best in Kathmandu. Please be aware of Nepal standards but for Nepal standards this was the best. They were always on time. The guide was very knowledgable and fun and gave is our space. Even had medical ideas around altitude sickness. The sherpa that schlepped our luggage was adorable and we tipped him a a lot. He was providing for his family with this. Please book UP. They are the Fair Trade of Nepal!"

My friend lost her wallet on a bus, we went to see him about it, and after a few calls he took her on his bike and they went and successfully retrieved it! Top man, top company, no need to look any further."

            "review": "Great Himalayan Annapurna Trek. After spending several weeks in India, I decided on a last minute trip to Nepal where I hoped to go trekking. I arrived in Kathmandu without any plans and was somewhat suspicious after being approached by someone at the airport who accompanied me to Adventure Master's Office. I met with Santosh who explored my interests and offered several recommendations. I was pleasantly surprised that there were no high pressure sales tactics. Santosh encouraged me to think about it overnight and get back to him the next day. I did so, checked out Adventure Masters on TripAdvisor, did a little comparison shopping and decided on the 5 day 4 night trek. Santosh offered a better price than the competitors. I would be responsible for purchasing food and beverages on the trek. Everything else was included and provided. My guide Hira was excellent. He had a wealth of knowledge about life and trekking in the Himalayas, introduced me to many locals during the course of our trek and was a pleasure to be with. The trek was physically demanding but Hira paced us accordingly. Given that it was the beginning of monsoon season, there were only limited opportunities to view the peaks. I knew this when I signed up. Nevertheless, the opportunity to experience nature and the local culture made the trek one of the highlights of my trip. I would trek with Adventure Masters and Hira again in a heartbeat and highly recommend them."

We met Santosh at our hotel and he made the arrangements for a 25 day trek for us.We trekked the Arun Valley Trail from Tumlingtar up to the Everest region, and then up to Gokyo Ri, EBC & Kala Patthar, returning to Kathmandu via Lukla.Santosh arranged:a porter/guideboth flights, for us and porter/guidetaxi in Kathmandunational park permitsTims cardWe had a great experience on our trek and would highly recommend it. The 9 days in the Arun valley are very beautiful, and the Khumbu region above is staggering, we highly recommend the trek, although the long time (25days) does take it's toll and it is very hard work.The guide that Santosh arranged for us (Jangbu) was excellent. He was local to the region and clearly had the local knowledge. His English was very good, and his French excellent. He was a greatt companion throughout the trek, and invaluable as a guide taking care of all our arrangements on route. Santosh's arrangements were all done on time, and all the flights and permits all worked. He also arranged for us to meet Jangbu and himself the evening before our departure, and had an informal debriefing with us in his office after which was very professional. Our only criticisms are that he did not introduce himself as a trekking organisation but claimed to be from the hotel before leading to his trekking office. Also the evening before we departed he gave us a \"schedule\" that he had \"made\". This was actually a copy from another camping trekking companies website that was not relevant to our own plans. Other than these small problems we were happy with his service."

When we initially arrived in Kathmandu we were brought to the office where we met Santosh, who was very transparent and open about the treks and our options. He organized a perfect trip given the amount of time we had in Nepal, and we headed off the next day to Pokhara. Our guide (and later friend) Raj was incredibly helpful with each little detail of our trip, from when we got sick to finding the best food. Super reasonably priced and the best way to enjoy Nepal's beautiful nature!"

The company was able to work with my limited schedule to make the trek quicker, but also enough to be enjoyable and safe. Prior to the trek I was given good advice on how to maximize my entire time in Nepal, while also having enough time to enjoy the trek. I had belongings that I did not want to bring with me on the trek and the company offered to store my bag with no extra charge until I returned to Kathmandu.Hiramani was my guide. He was very knowledgeable. I started to notice as the trek went on that other guides would ask him questions. I didnt have to worry about anything (accommation, getting my own water, when we would leave in the morning, etc). His top concern was safety. Doing a high elevation trek bring many challenges, but I was able complete the trek with absolutely no issues. I noticed some trekkers that decided to go without a guide made mistakes that effected their ability to finish the trek."

This is different from the typical tourist type of things I have done in the past and I would highly recommend it to someone who has two weeks or a little more to spend in nature. You can book through Adventure Master and ask for our guide, Hira. He will customize the trek to your needs and is very good at telling you what is best for you. I definitely needed his advice for certain parts of the trek. It is possible to trek on your own, but I would advise to have a guide for the first time. Especially someone like Hira who has done this trek over a hundred times and was able to go down the trails completely covered by snow and basically invisible without any problems."

This agency was responsible for our tour, we handcrafted our tour together according to our 14 days availability. Our agent - Santosh devoted a great deal of his time in discussing our primary interest in having a great trek experience. Santosh was great in handling all the arrangements to include our hotels, personal drivers, buses reservations, private tours and doing a follow up afterwords. He had explained to us about Nepal situation at the moment - the crisis of fuel, gas and eletricity which didn't almost affect us. Thanks Santosh for your warm smile.During our 4 days trek to Poon Hill we had one of our best experience ever!!! We were able to see beautiful views, contact the amazing Nepali people, experience their culture, food and happiness. Without question what made the difference in our trek was our private guide - BHARAT KUMAR which spoke very good English, he was friendly, polite, knowledgeable, patient and funny. We had a great 4 days with BHARAT ; ) He really stands out from the other guides, he was always walking behind/next to me making sure to help me if needed it, he patiently waited me to get my breath back whenever I needed it, he was kind to us and to Nepali people, we had great conversations during our trek, he taught us some Nepali words, the name of the trees and mountains, he also let my husband win every card game round. lololololo One thing I had missed in our experience which was the connection with other travelers, I guess it was because of our tight schedule. Poon Hill trek was beautiful and magical. It is a very tranquil trek with a great atmosphere. I was very impressed with the structure of the lodges and restaurants along the way. If you decide to do a tour in Nepal, I would recommend the following:1. Make sure to ask for Bharat as guide ; )2. Learn to say Namaste/Bohini/Di di/Dahi or Bayi. These simple acts of respect go a long way3. Travel Light, Light. Light; did I say Light. You will burden yourself with Luggage if you do not heed this advice. 4. If you are taking buses, go Turist bus, first class or private car. It is well worth the few extra dollars. MAKE SURE WITH YOUR AGENT. 5. Try to avoid public transportation such as local buses which can be extremely overcrowded in the larger cities. Rush hour can be overwhelming. Take either a metered taxi or arrange for a private driver.6. Make sure with your agent the quality of the hotel, if you have heating/AC in the room and if the hotel is experiencing power outage - very common. Lastly, our trip to Nepal exceeded our expectations. I highly recommend this company and our guide for your custom handcrafted tour of Nepal."

We met Keshab from Adventure Masters in our Kathmandu hotel and he suggested a 3 day Poon Hill trek which would be ideal for our time available and our fitness levels. He clearly broke every cost down and we were so comfortable booking the trip and knowing everything was taken care of. The whole 3 days we didn't have to worry about a thing. All our transport and accommodation was taken care of and we had an excellent guide - Gopal. Gopal was quiet but very knowledgable (although sometimes difficult to understand) and he encouraged me up the hard stretches and let me go at a comfortable pace the whole way (as I'm not the fittest person!) The trip was an excellent experience and we felt it was great value for money. The only 2 negatives I have are that on the final day (Christmas Day) we let the guide know we wanted to be back in Pokhara early to celebrate Christmas and we descended the mountain really quickly to do so but then the driver taking us back to Pokhara was 30 minutes late so we didn't arrive in Pokhara until later than we had hoped. Also, on our return to the hotel the guide made me sit down at a computer to write this review (with him standing close by) when I am tired and just wanting a hot shower and to celebrate Christmas! Awkward! Apart from these things, I can't fault the experience at all. Amazing trip!"

A total of 10 of us from Malaysia signed up for the Annarpurna Circuit + Tilicho Lake trekking tour. We hiked along mountainous region of Himalaya Range as if we were in an expedition in the movie \"Everest\". It was strenuous and challenging at start. However, as time passes, our fatigue was entirely engulfed by the amazing views of \"Vanila ice cream with chocolate top\" - the snowy view of mountains.Not forget to mention, our tour guide, Keshab was a great young man who can speak fluent English and Bahasa Malaysia. He shared a lot of hiking knowledge with us. For instance, he didn't recommend for us to take medication for altitude sickness. He would rather suggest us to stay longer time for acclimatization. As Nepal is not a developed country like US, wi-fi doesn't come handy. Keshab would sometimes entertain us with his Nepalese David Copperfield-styled magic. Porters in the company were also very helpful. Please be more generous with your tipping, though they don't request it. Also, do hire additional porter if necessary. It is not an easy job to be a porter, carrying tens of kilograms of weight behind their backs.Overall, it was an amazing trip. I will definitely go to the same country and sign for the same company under the same tour guide AGAIN."

His prices were very reasonable considering gas is insanely priced in the country right now. We also were not happy with the bus service so Santosh sent a driver all the way from Khatmandu to Pokhara to pick us up and give us a ride. The driver was also super nice, did a day tour of Khatmandu with us and took us to see all the temples and now is supposed to take us to Nagarkot tomorrow. Pleased with the services so far."

I booked to go on a trek to EBC at the very last minute - luckily it was the off season and Rewati was available to guide me through this journey.I was a bit concerned at first as this was my first ever trek, but Rewati's experience, level headed way of expressing things, his genuine care and vast experience of the trek really allayed these fears.Luckily for us, Rewati also knew another group who was doing a similar itinerary as us, so we managed to join as a group of 3 trekkers, which really made the trip extra special.For me, this trek was the hardest thing I have ever done. It was a hard slog up the mountain, and the altitude sickness was crippling (but manageable). The accommodation is relatively basic, and there will be days where you go without a shower - but is it all worth it in the end? Yes. Without a doubt!Also, simply put, without Rewati, I would not have made Base Camp.I got bad altitude sickness at Gorak Shep (struggled on the way up already to be honest) - but for Rewati's quick thinking in (force) feeding me a garlic soup + snickers, I would probably not have been able to meet up with the rest of group at Base Camp.Full props to Rewati, he is amazing. Book him by name if you decide to go.I had no experience in trekking, I was under-prepared (did not have a fresh water solution) etc - but Rewati made it work with minimal fuss."

            "review": "EBC'16, they made it possible.. More than a year back, I was reading an article about Mt. Everest and got to know about Everest Base Camp and how tough and intense it was to reach there. Though I consider myself pretty fit in the normal course of life, the thought of doing EBC at that time, appeared pretty extreme and physically challenging. I spoke to couple of my friends and after some inclusions and drop-outs, we were finally 6 of us who were serious to consider and attempt this mother of all treks. After doing our initial research, the biggest and the most important agenda for us was to identify and finalize the professional agency that would help us in our endeavor. We spoke to many agencies, some international, some local Nepalese, but short-listing and settling on one was not easy; thanks to the numerous models that all these agencies operated in. Finally, as a wise man once said, \u201cword of mouth is the best form of advertisement\u201d; with the help of a recommendation from a friend we stumbled upon Nepal Trek Adventure and Expedition in this big jungle of Nepalese trekking business. Our friend provided us with the co-ordinates of Binod Sapkota\u2019s (alias Babu), the Managing Director of Nepal Trek Adventure. Babu was available on every medium you could think of, whether it was phone, whatsapp, email, etc. and his response time was quite fast. Thanks to our group of novice trekkers and our amateur trekking experience, we bombarded him with all kinds of questions through emails, whatsapp and occasional calls at odd times. In our group of 6, five of us were guys and the sixth was a girl and as she was the only female in the group, she had some very specific questions pertaining to hygiene, safety etc. Babu, like a true gentleman, responded to all our queries and eased our anxiety. He very patiently explained the nitty-gritties of the trekking expedition, helped us with pictures to make his point and with the comfort he provided, we did not think twice and finally went ahead with our bookings.We landed in Kathmandu, and were greeted and received by none other than Babu himself at the airport, thus making us feel at home at once. During the next day of stay in Kathmandu, which was for better acclimatization, he arranged a small city tour for us in the morning, a trip to Thamel market for our last minute trekking shopping in the evening and a detailed briefing at dinner time to prepare us for the next day and the days to come. He introduced us to Rewati Prasad Parajulie, our guide, friend and the go-to person for anything and everything for the next 11 days. Rewati commanded a good experience of the Himalayas, EBC and other kinds of treks and was very level headed. Next afternoon in Lukla, we were also introduced to Binod Rana Magar, one of our porters and most importantly a second hand and assistant to Rewati. Every activity during the trek was managed and planned so well that we did not feel the enormity of undertaking one of the world's most difficult treks.All in all, I\u2019ll say the support from Babu from Kathmandu and all the guidance and help from Rewati and Binod from Lukla to EBC and back made the EBC dream come true and seamless for all six of us. After our trek, just before boarding the flight back home, I made an individual decision of returning to Nepal for other treks in and around Mt. Everest in future as a precursor to the big step of reaching the summit someday; and for all these future treks, one thing is for sure, we would love to have Babu, Rewati, Binod and the rest of the team with us."

            "review": "Seamless!!. We were a group of six novice Trekkers who committed to undertake the EBC trek together. Once the plan was finalised, we were left with the mammoth task of finalising the agency who would make our dream a reality. We surfed the net, did some research and spoke to various friends and colleagues who had already been to EBC; the outcome was a list of 4-5 shortlisted agencies. One thing that was a bit baffling was the huge range between what the various agencies were charging and therefore making Apple to Apple comparisons was becoming difficult. After all, what was the premium experience that an agency which was charging twice the sum over would provide compared to other agencies? Luckily, one of our colleagues who is an avid EBC Trekker guided us to Nepal Trek Adventure. Being the only woman in the group, I had lots of questions specific to safety and hygiene. It will be least to say that Binod Sapkota aka Babu - the trek Director was very prompt and receptive to all our questions right from the word go. He was able to address my inhibitions and relieve my anxiety to a great extent.From the time we landed in Kathmandu, Babu made sure that all our needs were catered to. We were introduced to our guide, Rewati Parajuli the day before we were leaving for Lukla.I cannot speak more highly for our guide, Rewati who was more of a friend during our 11 day trek to EBC and back. His calm demeanour and ability to find humour in all situations kept us going throughout the trip. Binod, one of our porters who was also acting as Rewati's assistant was like a breath of fresh air. He ensured that small details were tended to and took special care of me, which was so endearing.Wherever the ascent was challenging, I just had to follow Rewati's footsteps and thereafter it was a breeze to complete the day's trek. All in all, my friends and I were extremely happy with the services of Nepal Trek Adventure. I intend to undertake many more treks in the Himalayas and I would always want Rewati as my guide during all these hiking expeditions. "

He was reachable on phone, watsapp and on email and had addressed all our queries and concerns before we landed in Kathmandu. We were a group of friends, some of whom were of average fitness and hence we were concerned whether we would be able to complete the 11 day trek. Binod in his briefing session had shared some of the best practices to ensure that our hiking was a success and assured us that we will be well taken care of.Binod had aligned Rewati Prasad Parajulie as our guide and he did a fantastic job in ensuring our hike from Lukla to EBC and back was smooth, we had adequate breaks, were fed well and were put up in clean tea houses. The potters were diligent in their responsibilities, and one named Binod had been doubling up as an assistant guide which was very encouraging to see. The acclimatization planned throughout the hike was effective and we successfully completed the trek with zero injuries. Now thats what customer orientation and a good agency is all about !!!. To top all the above, Binod was kind enough to sponsor a day trip around kathmandu and host a farewell dinner :)"

The 3 day trek was the most amazing experience of my life. Apart from the unbelievable scenery and fantastic people we met along the way, our guide Dhana and porter Krishna were the most heart warming, helpful, fun filled and knowledgeable people I could have been around. I could almost say they were my Nepalese family! They really helped you capture a true insight into the Nepalese culture and the way they live. Eventhough I was only in their company and the country for a week, I have to admit, Nepal and Binods team have really earned a special place in my heart. Their decency and hospitality towards us was second to none. You will not regret going with them! I can't wait to meet them again for my next Nepalese adventure!!:)Mary (Irish girl;) x"

This is my second time to Nepal, and if I can possibly help it, it will not be the last.Binod, Ram, and Radj are family at this point. That is the level of service you will get from Nepal Trek Adventure. I travel to Nepal solo and I have never once felt unsafe. The team and collection of partners in Nepal will never leave you feeling ripped off, cheated, or questioning your decisions.Make SURE you go to A.K. Imports for your pashminas, sweaters, and blankets. I am still shocked at how kind they were. And I never had to haggle. The experience you would want to get from a visit to Nepal will be magnified 10 fold with this company. The sky is the limit, literally for what Binod and his team can put together for your packages. I have paraglided over fish farms and rice patties, touched the birthplace of Buddha, had a private day of meditation deep in the Himalayas, been off the beaten path, and have shopped until I dropped in the local streets glittered with goods beyond your wildest dreams! Enjoy Nepal the right way with Nepal Trek Adventure"

Our trip included Ghorepani Poon hill trek (4-5 days); 4 hours White water rafting (Grade 3+); 1-2 days at Chitwan National Park; Nagarkot to watch sunrise; Baktapur; Pashupatinath and Monkey temple. The trips all went well. The standard of accommodation was great in Katmandhu, Pokara and Chitwan. Only Nagarkot was a disappointment. After being in Annapurna the views were disappointing (cloudy/polluted) and hotel was a bit grubby. All very enjoyable. For recommended."

Our guide Krishna and our porter, Raj are great. Krishna is such a helpful guide with a lovely smile always on his face. He was very patient with me on the way even though I was very very slow. He is also very considerate with our demands and always tried to get us the best things available. Raj is very friendly porter and he helped us a lot with our luggage. Without him, we could have never made to the base camp. Thank you Nepal Trek & Adventure team! You would definitely be our choice in our next Nepal trek."

From the moment I initiated contact with Binod until my last day where he personally drove me to the airport, I would say he exceeded my expectations. He is very approachable, professional and accessible. He replies to messages almost asap and went out of his way to make sure I was satisfied.What impressed me was the effort he made to ensure I had my down jacket for our EBC trek (which was left behind in the store the day before). He made arrangements to send it with other people joining our tour group.There was 4 of us in the EBC tour group and we merged with another group of 3 who were doing the same trek until EBC. The two merged groups formed one big family with a great dynamic. We were also fortunate enough to have two guides - this was a good thing as our guide was lacking in some skills which was managed well afterwards.Upon our return Binod took us out for lunch and dinner and received and managed all of our feedback about the trek and guide feedback really well and very professionally.Binod also manages De Hotel Veda, a nice hotel in central Thamel where I stayed and he's also opening an adjoining restaurant soon.He's a good businessman and runs a professional service. I would recommend him to my friends and I would recommend and praise Dana as an exceptional guide."

We elected to do the Everest mini trek which is basically part way to base camp so you can see Everest in all its glory but the trek was half the time and didn't go above 4000m (good for insurance purposes!)When we came back Binod took us and Jimmy for coffee and listened to our feedback which was another nice touch.There are trekking / adventurer companies every second building in Thamel and it is really hard to choose someone to work with as some of these treks cost a lot of money but I would recommend Binod and NTA"

He was attentive to our needs and had no problem slowing down the pace when we were tired. He was friendly, easy to talk to, and extremely kind. He also knew all the shortcuts and which areas were dangerous. Our porter Raju was also wonderful and helped to arrange our accommodations and meals at guesthouses. We happened to be on the trek when the October 2014 blizzard hit the Annapurna region, so we eventually had to turn back. Binod, Deepak and Raju were so helpful during this time in contacting our families to let them know we were okay, as our cell phones had no signal. They even arranged to buy me a birthday cake from a local bakery the night of my birthday. Even though we could not complete the circuit, we had an excellent experience with Nepal Trek Adventures.

When first inquiring about the different treks available for my short break, I contacted many travel agents by email. Binod, Managing Director at Nepal Trek Adventures, was extremely fast and descriptive about what could be done during my short time in Nepal. He was very honest and explained the entire trip as well as what was needed. Traveling by myself and being a woman, I was very careful with the company I would choose. Needless to say that I was very reassured and booked quickly with them.Everything was well taken care of upon my arrival in Kathmandu, from the airport pick-up to the hotel (which belongs to the company). Even though I landed late (midnight) Binod and his team welcomed me at the hotel and introduced me to my guide Dipak. Next morning off we went! The trek was amazing, walking at my pace and Dipak was very attentive making sure that everything was taken care of and that I was at ease in every location & situation. He would share information on the local culture, tradition, fauna & flora and many other aspects. For travelers with only a week to spend hiking, I highly recommend the Ghorepani Poon Hill trek, it has a moderate difficulty (you have one day where you will climb 3200 steps though!) but it is worth it! The landscape is amazing and the highlight is the sunrise from Poon Hill at 3210m!I arrived as a client and left as a friend of both Binod & Dipak's, very down to Earth people who's aim is to share their beautiful country with you.If you are planning a trip to Nepal, don't think twice and book with Nepal Trek Adventures, you will not regret it.I am planning on returning in 2015 to do the Annapurna Base Camp and will definitely go with Binod and the team."

It's can be scary booking a big trip like this online, but the trip with Nepal Trek Adventures was so much more than I could have ever hoped for.

Airport pickups, hotel accommodation in Kathmandu, flights into Lukla, trekking, and then all of our activities in Kathmandu/Nepal when we returned. Nothing was ever a problem for Binod and his team and they all went over and above. Our guide through EBC & Gokyo Lakes, Dana, was experienced, knowledgable, caring, encouraging and was always making sure we had a great time. He got us great rooms at each of the guest houses and always made sure our tummies were full for all the trekking!

One example was when I was stranded in lukla bcos of a storm in kat and airport was shut down , Binod asked me to stay put at my hotel , had a guy wait at the airport for my tickets , and ensured I had a smooth way out of lukla ...

Kathmandu is full of agencies who will all promise the same package for the same price more or less. This makes it very hard to pick the best one for you.If you have time, I recommend spending a day researching this carefully, particularly meeting your guide, as this is what will make or break the trek for you.We first met Binod, the very charming and charismatic owner of Nepal Trek Adventures. He was very honest and upfront about his business and the way the Nepalese trekking tourist agency works, which we liked - he stood out from the rest and made it very easy to trust him.We met some of his guides and went with Kiran, who we strongly advise. We also met guides from other agencies who were extremely underwhelming, inexperienced, or who spoke very little English. Kiran had done this trek numerous times and spoke very good English.It's not expensive to hire a guide, especially when the cost is split between two. We recommend getting a guide instead of a porter guide - you will really get more out of it. Also, ideally carry your own bags: if you don't need it, don't bring it. We met a 47 year old woman carrying her own bag (she kept overtaking us and made us look like panting old men in the high altitudes), and a family of 5 Swiss of all ages, also carrying their own bags.But if you do hire a porter, please remember they are also human so don't overload them with heavy bags! We saw a lot of porters carrying far too much (some up to 35kg) during the trek.Kiran was our guide for the Annapurna trek. This was our first proper intense trek so were like two small boys needing a bit of nannying. Kiran was perfect. He sorted out everything from where to stop for a coffee/apple pie rest, to sorting out the accommodation bill at a local rate. He made sure we saw everything of interest and was so thorough and professional with every minor detail - always with a positive nature.We also had a few altitude symptoms when we hit 4,000-5,000 metres and higher. Kiran was patient and gave good advise for curing any altitude sickness symptoms, like going slower, drinking more water (oxygen in the water helps) and even drinking coca cola. We normally use coke as a toilet cleaner but found it helped rid of altitude headaches quite efficiently!The Annapurna circuit is by itself amazing, but having a good guide makes this experience one of those memorable experiences in your life.I highly recommend this agency because of the very honest way its owner, Binod runs the business, and, for Kiran who was such a terrific guide. Try to persuade Binod to give you Kiran as a guide if he is available - you won't regret it!"

The first thing we did was to research and read some reviews. We visited about 3-4 agencies. Out of the all Binod (the owner of Nepal Trek) was the one that was the most straight forward. No need to negotiate price, because it is probably the best in Kathmandu, but that doesn't mean the service is less. As you will quickly find out, many tour companies will use similar type of tea houses on the trek, so regardless with who you go, you will ended up on same quality place. The most important thing when doing a Trek is to make sure you have a connection with your Guide and that he understands your needs. You do not want to have any problems on a 14 day trek to Everest with your guide, so we wanted to make sure our guide was patience, since we are very very slow walkers, and we are not \"nature\" people, nor we have any background on trekking. Binod, introduced to Dhana (guide), which all we can say is the best guide, and most patient person who was always there when we needed some help.At one point my wife started having head-aches, Dhana was very concerned, and assured us that we didn't need to rush, or trek next day in case she wasn't feeling well. Which for our luck, she got better next morning and we were able to continue. During the trek, Dhana was very careful to make sure we don't go into a dangerous route, and always warning us when there was a sketchy part of trek. In our opinion two of the most important elements when choosing an agency for trekking is:1) Guide2) PriceWe had both. Not only that, Binod helped us arrange a pick up service for our Indian Visas while trekking, and also gave us a deal on his hotel which by the way was very nice. You don't need to look further, this agency is it. But in case you do go to other agencies, you will quickly find out you will have wasted time. Have fun trek !!"

We changed our plans and itinerary spontaneously on some days. Mr. Binod had no problem accommodating our many spontaneous requests. He seamlessly set us up for any trip that we may have heard about from some other tourist and wanted to see. Mr. Binod's experience, and commitment to his customers, as well as his conscientiousness and caring toward his guides and porters make Nepal Trek Adventure and Expedition the go-to company in Nepal. We cannot wait to return to the area for more adventure! I must say by using a locally owned and operated company, my family and I had a more authentic and personal experience. This was quite a refreshing change from the American company we had used 15 years before where we experienced a tourist \"tick-list\" approach.We will definitely use Nepal Trek Adventure and Expedition on our return to this wonderful country!"

We were really thankful for making our trip a very memorable one."

He promised us the trip of a life time and that is what we got. In the past I have taken 'tailor made' tours that have been anything but!!! From the very first meeting Binod did everything within his power to make the trip run smoothly - whether it be regularly reviewing our plans and amending them to meet our needs, supplying us with a SIM card to make contact easy when we were touring, providing us with excellent, knowledgeable guides & drivers, changing money, being available 24/7 to answer questions - the list is endless. Nothing was too much trouble and any request was met with 'just give me a few minutes to see if that is possible' and Binod and his team always made it possible. We could only stay four days and Binod managed to plan a trip which gave us with everything on our wish list - the major sites in Kathmandu, white water rafting, flight over Everest, elephant safari, elephant bathing, jungle walk, kayaking and even some shopping...... We will visit again and we will use Binod and his team to give us our next adventure. I would recommend without any hesitation that anyone who is planning a trip to this beautiful country contact Binod. Thanks again Binod and hope to see you in October, if not before in Dubai."

I had been in, I dont even know how many trekking offices that day, trekking companys seam to be everywhere in nepal. But walking in this place was different. Housed upstairs it was just a little office but thats not what caught me, it was the sounds of laughter and yelling coming from the door. I knocked and binod, a spiffy dressed gentleman (the owner) answered and lead me into his office, past 4 employes all talking and laughing around a table . Right then I knew these guys were fun! I almost wanted to sit down and join them right then and there.They seamed like they loved their jobs and that ment they took pride in what they did. I planned a trip with NEPAL TREK ADVENTURE AND EXPEDITION starting in chitwan and doing: jungle walk, elephant ride, visiting elephant santuary, making \"elephant momos\" (elephant food), seeing elephant bathing station and, doing a river canoe ride. Then I proceeded to lumbini, the birth place of lord budda. I rented bikes and went around the whole development. From there the final stop was beautiful pokhara, I started my time in pokhara with a trek and ended by paragliding into town. And finished it with a canoe ride out to the rice feilds with my girlfriend. Now I am a 19 year old student and by no means am I rich, binod presented me with a once in a life time trip that I could afford. His is a gentlemen and a man to be trusted, he and his team of guides are a rare breed of men!"

His dedication, knowledge and initiative allowed me to pack a huge amount of unforgettable activities ad experiences and took care of all logistics to the smallest detail. To illustrate this, he booked my flight from Lhasa to Pokhara, connecting via Kathmandu, and on the day of the flight realised that the first leg of the flight had been delayed, so he took the initiative of rebooking me on a later flight to Pokhara and still ensure I was able to arrive in time to begin my yoga and meditation course!

He also said if we have no connection with the guide he offered we should not hesitate to tell him he will find a better one.But we were happy with his choice and so we started to our adventure of my lifetime. Small troubles at the beginning got easily solved from our guide and so we really made it to the top and back to Pokhara. All in All it was a great trip we had. Rabi safely guided us around the Annapurna region, he provided us with the best rooms and food places; we also got to know some \"secret spots\".

Granted it is not cheap, but after traveling for 7 months, that is still my best memory and one that I've told countless times to others. We took off from Kathmandu, came up through the clouds and were speechless at the view of the Himalayas. We then got a fantastic view of the the big one, Mount Everest, with the classic wisp of clouds at its peak. After landing at a Sherpa basecamp to \"de fuel\" so we could get higher, we then got another, closer view of the storied mountain, along with some of the other massive mountains that pail in comparison.

            "review": "Bhutan: Breakfree no value added, read to see what we wish would have known prior. Contrary to the great glowing reviews you see for Breakfree, our experience with them was not so nice when arranging an 8 day, 7 night, culture tour visit to Bhutan. Read below to see what we would have liked to know when we started planning the visit to Bhutan.\u2028\u2028Breakfree\u2028Initially Breakfree was very responsive and helpful to our questions. As soon as we paid the deposit however, communication was extremely slow or non existent. I guess that this was due to the unresponsiveness of the visa office. However the slow and non responsive communication increased our frustration and made us unsure of our trip, and the huge cost associated.For the deposit, we refused to write our credit card details an 3-digit code on a piece of paper and send a scan. They offered to accept by PayPal. \u2028\u2028Visa process unclear\u2028Regarding the visa for Bhutan, they would say they would get back to me on date x but it would take several followups by me to get an answer many weeks later. We finally received the visa two weeks before arrival.\u2028\u2028Arrival process unclear\u2028We still didn't know who we would meet in Bhutan or what the process would be upon arrival a day before we arrived! Breakfree finally answered a whatsapp message less than a day before arrival. \u2028\u2028Poor communication made us cautious and unsure\u2028The poor communication with Breakfree brought us to Bhutan in an overly cautious, careful mindset - it set a bad precedent for our week in the Bhutan.\u2028\u2028Good to know:\u2028After arrival, we learned that \u2028- Breakfree is simply an agent for another travel company based in Bhutan\u2028- travel agencies in Bhutan cannot register on tripadvisor, that's why we didn't see any from Bhutan\u2028- Breakfree should have passed us over to the Bhutan agency to answer our questions and arrange things but didn't\u2028\u2028Payment problems\u2028Breakfree also wrote that we could pay by credit card when we arrived. However the Bhutan travel company said this was not correct and they were expecting cash payment in USD. After some arguments, the local company accepted our credit card payment by taking us to a nearby gift shop and charging us the amount plus a fee of 3% (bartered down from 7%). My receipt is from a gift shop. Even though Breakfree sent the name of the local company, Bhutan Wilderness Travel, at the beginning, we had such little contact with them prior to arrival that it was easily forgotten. Fortunately, the manager at the local Bhutan company was in the end helpful, expressed a willingness to help and worked in a problem-solving manner.\u2028\u2028We had a guide and a driver. The driver didn't say much. The guide was young, 30s. He normally does trekking tours which I could see him good for, but for a cultural tour it was not the right fit. He was not fun, his knowledge of many things we saw was little and too general. We even had trouble believing what he was saying. At the end we were not listening much anymore, looking forward to our departure.\u2028\u2028We did meet several people on other tours that expressed their enjoyment. \u2028\u2028Bad start: itinerary was unrealistic\u2028The first thing the guide said upon arrival is that there are mistakes in our itinerary. It was true, the itinerary was not adjusted to the working week. Saturday and Sunday full days were planned, but Saturday is a half working day and Sunday all is closed, most things planned these days were unrealistic. Two long driving days were planned, one he said the road is in too bad of condition to make it to a valley with the planned stop at a fort during its opening hours. The other was too icy because it is so high. The question I'm thinking: is he being lazy or truthful? My only baseline is this itinerary, which we used to select a tour, and now it turned out to be useless.\u2028\u2028Bhutan: not good for independent backpacker explorers\u2028-> To visit Bhutan you must accept that you will be contained with your driver and guide most of the time. If you are an independent backpackers and you don't enjoy the time with your guide, it can feel especially claustrophobic. \u2028\u2028We would recommend to future visitors of Bhutan:\u2028- Bhutan is expensive, daily low season fee of 200 USD and flights around 700 USD each, and a visa fee of 40 USD per person, then a tourism development fund fee of 10 USD per person, put together we paid more than 300 USD per day overall, this is significant - and in our view far too high a price to pay when you consider the cost of living is similar to India. Moreover, we learned that it is customary to tip, 10-20 USD per day, on the higher end for the driver and the lower end for the driver. However, as we were not satisfied with the tour we left no tip.\u2028\u2028Advice if you must go:\u2028- it seems most tours do the same things, book a company through the gov tourism website. Maybe just pick a few at random- we haven't been able to find a reliable review site \u2028- don't use an agent because they will take a cut, meaning less money for your trip, and in our case no value add.\u2028- read lonely planet Bhutan before booking\u2028- stay only for 3 or 4 days max, if you only want to do the cultural tour. We got very tired of forts and seeing the same type of things each day, and being contained by our guide and driver. Unfortunately I don't know how you will ensure the guide you get will be good or not- prepare to spend a lot of money and set low or no expectations\u2028\u2028We liked:\u2028- Tigers Nest, a tough hike but worthwhile \u2028- seeing Phalluses on the front of houses\u2028- seeing Everest during the flight over Himalayas from Delhi (sit at left side window)\u2028- about half the hotels were nice and comfortable \u2028- speaking with locals away from our guide\u2028- hot stone bath and a dinner with a local family, request both to your travel companyOur suggestion for Breakfree: be more straightforward on the status if there's delays, communicate better the process and the next steps, handover properly to the local agent"

I would recommend providing a chicken/vegetarian sandwich instead of cheese sandwich (which didn't taste that fresh) and a fried chicken breast separately.Overall we had great time with the hike and would definitely use breakfree for our next adventure."

            "review": "Amazing guides and excellent value for ABC trek in Nepal and cultural tour in Bhutan. If I could give our guides / porter / driver 6 stars here I would. My fiance and I just concluded two tours with Breakfree Adventures starting with (1) a 9 day Cultural Tour of Bhutan with their partnering local tour operator Bhutan Wilderness Travel and (2) an 11 day Annapurna Base Camp Trek in Nepal.I'm so glad I found and booked with Breakfree Adventures due to their excellent TripAdvisor reviews and value for money. But what really stood out for me was the warm service provided by their amazing staff all around.BHUTANBhutan is a beautiful, unique and sparsely populated country and we were so glad we got to go while many of its customs are still preserved. Sometimes while standing in a medieval village surrounded by green hills and pine forests or inside the walls of a medieval dzong (Bhutanese fortress / temple / palace) I felt like I was in an Asian version of Game of Thrones. No dragons of course but they do have mythical-looking takins, an animal that looks like a moose with a guinea pig face.Our guide Kesang Tenzin and our driver Tandin made our trip wonderful. They took care of everything and all we had to do was follow them, eat when told to eat, etc. Kesang is really funny and extremely knowledgeable about Bhutan's culture and fantastical history, we nicknamed him the \"Divine Madguide.\" We were also lucky to have Tandin as our driver (he was subbing in to help his brother), since he has excellent English as well and we got to talk about things like American movies and TV shows and generally get a perspective on how young people in Bhutan view the future. As Kesang says, Bhutanese men's hemlines are getting longer while women's hemlines are getting shorter.We loved every sight and activity but our top favorite experiences were: (1) Visiting the Punakha Dzong during a once in a 400 year event when the Zhabdrung's relics were on display for the first time and hundreds of Bhutanese were on line to see them and hundreds more were inside the dzong courtyard chanting beautifully in unison. (2) White water rafting on Class III+ rapids in Punakha's male river (my fiance fell off the raft while riding over a set of rapids called Buddha's Wrath!) (3) Trying their national sport archery and eating a delicious traditional dinner with locals and other tourists at a 300 year old farmhouse in Paro. We are excited to go to Bhutan again in the future and will probably explore the much less touristed eastern region with Kesang.NEPALKathmandu is an overwhelming place to land in for the first time (esp. coming from tiny, quiet Paro), so it was great that manager Bharat and our awesome guide Ramesh Duwadi picked us up from the airport and from then on helped us with anything and everything we wanted or needed in Nepal. On day 1, Ramesh helped us rent and buy our gear for the trek in Thamel. Giving realistic and good advice on what we need and don't need. We are hopeless New York urbanites and this was our first mountain trek, and of course we chose to spend it in the highest mountain range in the world! Going from ~1000m to 4130m and back in 7 days.The ABC trek itself was difficult, A LOT of up and down stairs for most of the ascent and descent days (days 2, 3, 4 and 5 were the hardest for us) but well worth it. Seeing the snow covered peaks was the highlight but we also had fun at the lower altitudes seeing all the Gurung villages, cute farm animals, relaxing at Jhinu hot springs and picking / eating elderberries. Noticing that my fiance was picking tiny wild strawberries, Ramesh introduced us to elderberries. The bushes are tall and full of thorns though both Ramesh and Dipak had no problem climbing up and picking handfuls of berries for us. They both went out of their way to make sure we were safe and had fun every day. Ramesh warned us about stinging nettle at the start of the trek. Nevertheless, on day 2 I touched it accidentally when retrieving my dropped poles. I freaked out at the intense pain and Ramesh immediately found and picked a local plant, created a paste and rubbed it onto my fingers which neutralized the pain and he did this again later in the day when the pain came back. Later on the trek I got unpleasant stomach troubles which made me weak and in pain for 2-3 days, Ramesh gave me antibiotics from his first aid kit and even helped carry my day pack when i was struggling up a snow covered hill approaching ABC. The grips of my sneakers were worn out and I fell or slipped almost a dozen times on snow, mud or slippery rocks. I don't like asking for help but Ramesh helped hold on to my arm over particularly slippery stretches. And Dipak helped me up a few times even with a wobbly 30 kg on his back. Just for fun, my fiance and I tried on Dipak's pack and walked uphill for a minute. So tough! Incredible how Dipak carries this all day long, walks twice as fast as us and never loses his balance (even without any poles) and is never out of breath. It must be the legendary power of dal bhat! By day 6 we had soreness in our knees from all the descending and Ramesh led us in a nice mini yoga session. Definitely ask for him if you would like a yoga + trekking tour.Every night at the tea houses (lodges), we would collapse from exhaustion. We never had to wait for a room and our guide worked hard to make sure we would get a large room and not have to share with other trekkers for more comfort. Our guide and porter would patiently wait and make sure to serve us dinner before they would eat. Ramesh would cut us fresh fruits every night for dessert. None of the other guests would have this. Also these guys are hilarious, we would play Nepalese card games for hours every night: dhumbal which Dipak would suspiciously beat us at almost every time and donkey which results in a lot of slamming the table and each other's hands (sorry other guests!). Day after day, they were becoming our good friends.We were not the easiest customers because on day 1 we requested to change the itinerary so that we could stay 1 night at Annapurna Base Camp, meaning we had to be at least 2 hours ahead of the trekking schedule in the days before. And very last minute on the evening of day 6 we requested a change again to take the bus from Pokhara to Kathmandu one day early in order to spend 2 nights in Kathmandu instead of 1. Our guide Ramesh executed the plan immediately, he made a lot of calls (while we were still in a mountain lodge) to change hotels, cancel our bus and even arranged a heavily discounted private car to take us to Kathmandu on the afternoon of day 7. We were so glad he helped arrange all of this so that we could have a full day to explore Kathmandu's top sights.Ramesh and Dipak made our experience in Nepal seamless. While the 3-8 hours of hiking up and down every day was difficult (even for a marathon runner like me), everything else was made easy thanks to the wonderful people of Breakfree. In addition to the trek, we also had a fun tour of Pokhara's top 4 sights and a nice farewell dinner on our last night in Kathmandu, both were with Ramesh. We want to come back to Nepal later to do the more challenging Everest Base Camp and will definitely request to have Ramesh and Dipak again, they're the best."

The gear they provide us also make us think them, as we are living in desert and don\u2019t have gear for the cold weather, they provided for the free of cost which was very good part. Also we start checking their background online and found very positive review everywhere and we choose them.We had many questions before booking with them and they are never tired to reply all our weird questions.The choices of hotels are perfect and bid our expectations.

Among many good points which other reviews have already mentioned, two things which impressed me were the little things they did. Before the actual trek, Dipak went to buy a bag of fruits. We didn't think much about it until meal times..... we were the only group that had fruits! Logistic and preparation was very well taken care of. We spoke to other trekkers and realised their guide didn't book the tea house in advance which resulted in them sleeping in the dining hall! The founder of breakfree, Barat, whom you will correspond with, was very accommodating with our requests in putting together a customised itinerary for us."

I wrote to several trekking companies, all based in Nepal. Some never wrote back. But Bharat Sapkota got back to me right away. His agency, Breakfree Adventures, is one of the few to also have a US phone making communication prior to my visit easy.I am going to confess right now that I was not an easy client. I changed my itinerary several times before my arrival inNepal, and then changed my trek in Nepal when weather conditions turned sour. Through it all Bharat accommodated me every step of the way. I finally ended up doing an 8 day cultural trek in the Himilayas and a 4 day 3 night trip to Chitwan National Park. In all, I had a great time. Prices were very reasonable and my service was excellent. Every guide I had (trek guide, jungle guide, and Kathmandu City guide were great, fluent in English, and flexible. All made sure I had a great time in Nepal.Recommendations for future travelers. Schedule extra days. Bad weather in the Himalayas can make a trek difficult and getting back on time almost impossible. If, at the end of your trek, you still have time, then Breakfree can easily accommodate you with shorter treks and other tourist options. Regardless, Nepal is a great place to visit and my experience with Breakfree was terrific.Photo is of a large Rhino seen on the jeep tour of Chitwan National Park. I strongly recommend the 4 day 3 night tour of the park as it offers more activities and many more wildlife viewing opportunities than the more common 2 night 3 day trek."

            "review": "Annapurna Circuit Trekking in late November 2015. In 2014, my wife and I did the Annapurna Base Camp Trekking. We were so enthralled by landscapes, people, colours and light that we had to return to Nepal and to attempt the Annapurna Circuit. We were thrilled but also anxious about trekking over 5,416 m altitude (the target altitude on day 11 of the trek), whilst at home in Germany we live just at 45 masl. We booked a package containing two porters and one guide (all English speaking), accommodation and meals, and transportation with Breakfree Adventures. Breakfree Adventures was recommended by my company's office in Kathmandu. After the sudden and tragic events at the circuit in October 2014, we did not wish to do any compromises with the company organising the trek (the readers may recall that a cyclone over India caused heavy snowfall in the Himalaya and trapped trekkers at and around the Thorong-La Pass; it was a sad tragedy and the news went around the world). Our intention was to go with an absolute professional company and experienced and English speaking guide. We checked various sources of customer reviews, including Trip Advisor and all feedback on Breakfree Adventures read impressively positive. Hence, we decided to test Breakfree Adventures. The correspondence was quick and informative. Rates were competitive, and when eventually planning the programme and trekking schedule, Breakfree Adventures was very flexible and included all our suggestions. And indeed we were not disappointed. Guide and porters were professional, very kind and polite, and extremely attentive throughout the trek. We could not have made a better choice. The accommodation arranged was always top range of the guest houses; the budget for food was generous and we were taken well care of from the first day until the last day. We have no hesitation to recommend Breakfree Adventures as a trekking tour operator and organizer for any such tours in Nepal.As most trekkers, we did the Circuit anti-clockwise. We started on Nov 23 for a 14-day tour inclusive travel from Kathmandu to Besi Sahar (by vehicle) and return travel from Jomsom to Pokhara and the day thereafter from Pokhara to Kathmandu (both by air). The trekking itineraries of the Circuit are all similar but the breath-taking part of the Annapurna Circuit definitely starts in Upper Pisang with beautiful vistas of the mountain range and the valley (Annapurna II is just opposite). Photographers can live out all passion and take beautiful night and early morning shots of the Annapurna range (ideal before sunrise). Note, Upper Pisang is definitely worth staying a 2nd day. There is much to see and to discover. The Himalaya Hotel (just below the monastery in Upper Pisang) is a very commendable choice to stay. The views from their balcony and dining room are spectacular.Another stop to remember was Brakha, which is just about 30 trekking minutes before Manang. No question, Manang is a must town to visit and most trekkers stay in Manang. But our reason for staying in Brakha and not in Manang was the easier access and ascent to the Ice Lake (a climb of 1,200 altitude meters) and on the other side of the valley the reach of the Milerepa Cave and the Glacier Viewpoint. When staying in Brakha, an excellent choice to stay is the Himalayan Lodge, a superb guest house with comfortable rooms (toilet and bathroom attached to the rooms) and an exquisite cuisine with surprising international flair. It out-rated all guest houses we stayed before during the trek. Yak Kharka is another perfect spot for night photographers. It is just one night before Thorung Pedi and Thorong-La Pass next morning. I took a series of good shots of the Milky Way before midnight (a tripot is a must). The lower mountain range in Yak Kharka is a fantastic foreground for astrophotography and the clarity during the night was fantastic (early December).Overall the Annapurna Circuit is doubtless one of the world\u2019s most spectacular treks and we will long remember the days. If you have the time, take a rest day at the Fishtail Lodge in Pokhara, a superb hotel on an island in the Phewa Lake and near the main commerce street in Pokhara. It is a beautiful spot to find the sense of time again after having lost it during the trek."

Bharath came to the airport to receive us and dropped us at the hotel, made arrangements for exchange of currency arranged for reliable guides for both the city tour and the hike. Bharath is very professional honest and trustworthy. He is intent on making his customers happy.... Just like I the unted states, customer is very important for bharath.As far as the trek, we had an excellent Sherpa called Dorji and he was amazzzzzing..... Very strong carried about 60 pounds on his back and still hiked much faster then us. The Lat two days he came back after dropping the luggage at the teahouse and came back and carried both my sister and my backpack.... We wer amazed how little gear he had so we gave a lot of our gear to him.We did the hike over 6 nights 7 days. It was an amazing journey. Very safe trails. The people of Nepal are very nice and honest people. The food was excellent at tea houses. Our guide had bought with him some fresh fruits to feed us and that also helped. My sister and I were able to achieve our goal of seeing EBC and kalapathar. Overall I had a great experience with break free adventure and recommend them. Also, Nepal seems like a safe country for single women to travel. Amazing place! Amazing people! Talented piolets and beautiful mountains."

We feel deeply saddened by the earthquake that happened soon after we got back. I am sure, however, that soon Nepal will be able to safely welcome tourists.

The accommodation was excellent in the major resorts and the trekking lodges were comfortable, warm, with good food and very friendly. Flying over Everest was something I always wanted to do and to achieve this was very emotional. I chose to do paragliding in Pokhara, was just a dream with stunning scenery. Bathing elephants in Chitwan was a life ambition and later cocktails watching the sunset rounded off a perfect day. All in all we had an unforgettable holiday in Nepal. The people are so friendly and it was truly one of my best holidays ever"

If you love the mountain, you will definetly love Nepal and all the options that you can choose depending on the days or the level of difficuty. The first time that we met Ramesh, in Kathmandu, he helped us to get ready before going to the mountains and he really took care of us during all the trekking. His English is perfect and he really knows what he is doing. He gave us good tips all the time while we were doing the trekking and he was always cheerful and helpful. Thanks to Breakfree, we've seen the most beautiful mountains in the world and we lived an adventure that we will never forget.I can't say a bad word about Bharat, Ramesh and Breakfree. They made us love this country and we will definetly come back again. Of course, with Breakfree Adventures."

Nothing was too much for him and he answered every little question we had as quickly as he could. As for the price of the trip and what it included, just outstanding really what can I say! We were collected from the airport by private car and taken on a full day tour of Kathmandu the following day. Our guide was fun and informative and after the initial shock of the city, this tour really opened up our eyes to the cultural, hidden beauty of Kathmandu. The following day we headed off on our 6 hour drive to Pokhara which would be the base for the start and end of our Poonhill trek. We met our guide Ramesh and porter Shree Krishna who I wholeheartedly take my hat off to for carrying out bags with a permanent smile on his face!! This trek wasn't too tough as treks go in Nepal but it pushed my comfort boundaries that's for sure and I loved it so much. Seeing the local people go about their tough daily lives with smiles on their faces really made us take a step back and think about life. Ramesh was great, answering my never ending questions, putting up with my moans about the cold and holding my hand all the way down a serious amount of icy steps on the way to Tadapani, such a star :-) On the way back to Kathmandu, we paid a little extra (and I mean a little) to take the 25 minute flight on the smallest plane I've ever been on but thoroughly worth it! Such was the personal touch that Bharat likes to include in his tours, he collected us from the airport himself, took us out for our final dinner in the evening and back to the airport early the following morning. I recommend you book with Breakfree Adventures wholeheartedly for a personal, incredibly good value for money and life changing trip to Nepal,Bharat and his team should be so proud of themselves for the incredible job they're doing."

Our guide was very knowledgable about the different sites, but was very quiet and had to be prompted to tell us information - not a problem, just a different style.

We had full flexibility from the first day and were able to adjust the itinerary and trekking pace to suit our progress acclimatizing to the altitude. We made it to the top of Gokyo Ri at 5,360m - hard to imagine a more spiritual and spectacular place. Toward the end of the trek, we added on side day-hikes to the Khumjung and Thomo villages and monasteries - thus adding a big cultural element to our trek. Highly recommended. Also climbed up the ridge above Machermo during an unscheduled but necessary additional day of acclimatization on the way up. Well worthwhile with views of Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, Cholatse, Taboche, Kantega, Thamserku and Cho Oyo. Breakfree Adventures did a great job. Russell Goodman and Sarah Ellwood."

Before we appointed Breakfree Adventures, I raised a lot of questions about Nepal and the trip, and luckily Bharat Sapkota, the owner, was very patient in answering each one of my question.After a few weeks back and forth email communication, we finally agree with the offer and gave down payment. It was the best decision that we could possibly make.The guide assigned to us (Ramesh Duwadi) was really friendly, patient and very helpful. Never get tired of our constant nagging to have food or snack. When we cannot go to one of the site that was in our itinerary because of the landslide, he quickly thought of another place that we can visit as a replacement. It's this type of quick thinking that make us appreciate him even more. Furthermore, Breakfree Adventure also help us even after their service was finished. When the airlines lost my friend's luggage on the first day in Nepal and the luggage finally arrived at Kathmandu after we had left Nepal, they help to arrange for the luggage to be sent to her home.I really enjoy my visit in Nepal thanks to Breakfree Adventure and I recommend this tour if anyone ever want to visit Nepal.

First impression is everything, and out of the numerous companies I had contacted concerning my trip, Bharat wrote back exactly what I wanted to hear. Other companies would just send you random itineraries. Not Bharat! He explained to me everything and even warned me that it might rain and plans might change but he was ready for it! We took a 6-day itinerary and let me tell you we did not have 1 useless minute! Jam packed with everything that we might think of: Bungy jumping, rafting, paragliding, sunrise/sunset-ing, elephant riding, sight seeing, hiking, and even eating! Bharat's choice were perfect, and what made it all better was that we had a personal car, with a driver AND a tour guide! Our driver was exquisite, Nomarash (I hope I spelled it correct!), who was able to drive 5 hours straight sometimes with one break so that we don't waste time, and MAN he's a talented driver!!! Our tour guide Ramesh became family, as we shared numerous hours together and learned so much about this beautiful country! We couldn't have asked for anyone better! I could talk ages about this trip, but I wouldn't want to spoil it for you! My final note would be that we paid a very fair price for all the hard work these gentlemen have done! That's why I'm going again next month, and every month I have the chance to, because Nepal is one of the most beautiful places you can see in life, and Breakfree Adventures will always be there to show me the real beauty this country offers.

With only a few hours to plan, I just told Bharat and Jamyang (my Bhutanese tour guide) that I wanted an active, cultural, non-western experience and that is what I was given. Bharat is also kind, responsible, and helpful. He is available anytime or day and will provide anything you need. Thanks Bharat and Jamyang. Can't to see you again soon."

I like the traditional nepali dinner he arrange for us on our last day and we got to know him and his country more.Our guide Shankar was very helpful and knowledgeable during the whole whole trip.

Bharat, who will be arranging your schedule and other procedures ahead of the trip, will provide all necessary help, and respond quickly to your questions. Upon the arrival and until the departure, the local guides will also make the best efforts to guarantee a satisfactory stay. Hotels are just \"okay,\" but you will at least find no problems. Foods are also good, if you are comfortable with Asian foods. Above all, the guide is very well informed with the history of Bhutan, and provides clear and easy explanations whenever you visit historical sites. Unlike other tour packages in other countries (based on my experience), they will not take you to shops where they will induce you to buy pricey handicrafts. The entire schedule is focused on your satisfaction. The guide will also modify the schedule upon your last-minute request. For me, instead of visiting more temples, the guide allowed me to have a tea with a lama, and we exchanged various conversations on life, religion, and everything. An unforgettable experience!I know 250 USD a day may seem expensive, it is definitely worth it.There are many Bhutan-related tourism agencies out there, and there could be better ones. But if you do not want to waste time choosing a travel agency, I can tell you things cannot go wrong if you choose to travel with Breakfree Adventures. Travelling to Bhutan may be complicated, but things get a lot easier when travelling with the agency."

I got through to him less than 2 weeks before we arrived in Nepal but he was able to arrange everything very quickly and our tour went smoothly. We basically had a free hand in what we wanted to do (I already had an itinerary from my research and from talking to other tour operators), but he also suggested additional activities that we liked. I picked Breakfree because they quoted the lowest price and required the least downpayment (among operators I equally did not know), but had a great rating on trip advisor. It was certainly the right choice.Our guide Shankar was very accommodating and knowledgeable about the sites we visited. He also acted as our expert photographer and sometimes haggler. He was always waiting for us ahead of time, and concerned with even where we would take dinner after our tour for the day.Our driver was always smiling and an expert in maneuvering in Nepal's tight spaces and twisting mountain roads.The hotels we stayed in were clean and comfortable. In the one case where I asked for a different hotel than the one recommended, the one Breakfree recommended seemed better. At least it looked much nicer from the outside and was on the lakefront.When our mountain flight to Everest got cancelled, we had no trouble getting our money back as Breakfree was the one who processed the refund on our behalf.I also liked the personal touch of the traditional Nepali dinner on our final night before Bharat personally took us back to the airport.In summary, Breakfree was a delight to deal with even before getting to Nepal, and we were very well taken-cared of from landing until takeoff thanks to Breakfree Adventures."

Bharat at Breakfree Adventures filled our brief beautifully. We wanted to do a horse or pony trek in Nepal. We had quite a limited amount of time and wanted to cover as much country as we could. Bharat organised a fantastic itinerary and employed the services of a fabulous guide, Ramesh. Ramesh was informative, interesting, helpful, concerned when we both became a little ill, but not in our face. Perfect! We rode on a couple of local ponies that were very sure footed and quiet. My pony allowed me ample opportunity to take many many photos while walking our track. We have fallen in love with Nepal and will definitely be back to cover another area, and of course doing it in an off the beaten track manner. We will be back to Bharat to help plan and organise this in the future. I have absolutely no hesitations in recommending Breakfree Adventures. If you are looking for something extraordinary, Bharat will be able to organise it for you. A special thank you to Bharat, Ramesh, Nema, Tankanats for an amazing adventure."

The necessary changed of transportation mean from tourist bus to private car(due to time constraint) to access Pokhara, Chitwan and Last resort just cost me a little extra, definitely a great favor from Bharat.

Our trek on the Manaslu Circuit could not have been better managed, coordinated, guided and portered. I have limited vision and knew that the satisfaction of my trek was going to depend to a large degree on my guide's attention and genuine concern for my well-being, as well as my friend's. After reading a previous review by a deaf person, I decided to work with Breakfree. From the beginning, Bharat provided excellent and timely service, even when we needed to delay our trip just two weeks prior to our scheduled arrival. We were very pleased with how he competently handled logistical changes to accommodate our needs. Our guide Tonka went above and beyond, assisting me on difficult trail sections, and providing all kinds of cultural insights as we walked through the mountains; and he's not afraid to jump into a busy teahouse kitchen and whip up a dynamite meal! He's a gem of a guide. He, and our porters, took their jobs seriously, and we shared a lot of laughs with all of them. I couldn't recommend Breakfree enough, and hope after reading this review, you put your trust in them for your trek/trip...you'll be happy you did!"

We had a five day window to trek in the Everest area, but an unprecedented return of the monsoon shut down flights to the starting point, Lukla, for the entire time. After our flight was grounded the first morning, Bharat and trekking guide Ramesh Duwadi, anticipating events, got our tickets switched to Pokhara for that afternoon, so we could trek in the Annapurna area.Unfortunately, the weather was bad there, too, so we trekked five days in clouds and rain. But Ramesh was invaluable. He grew up in a small village, so he could explain everything we saw, from architecture to farming practices to hydroelectric projects. He sometimes went ahead to get us a room at a tea house before the crowds showed up. His English was excellent and he made friends with everybody we met along the way.Breakfree even threw in two extra nights at a nice hotel in Pokhara and Ramesh finally managed to get us a view of the Himalayas from Sarangkot the morning before our flight back to Kathmandu. Then, even though we didn't leave Nepal until five days later, Bharat picked us up from our hotel at 6 am and drove us to the airport."

We asked our driver, Nabaraj (who is a very great guy I highly recommend, by the way), to ask Bharat if we could just change our itineraries on the fly like that. He made it work. He just gave us a price quote for the added trip the car was going to take and agreed to wait for us to get back to Kathmandu for the payment.

BHARAT from Breakfree Adventures was amazing in expressions of promptly answering questions and offering travel trips. BHARAT provided the necessary information for our group to make informed decisions, concerning all aspects of the tours including hotel selections, modes of transportation and must see places.We all agreed that the trip could not have been better. We visited Kathmandu, Chitwan, Pokhara, Sarangkot and Dhampus. From the moment we arrived at the Kathmandu airport, we were well escorted. There was not one issue with transportation, the accommodations, tours, and guides. We originally were traveling from Pokhara to Kathmandu by the Tourist bus, but because of a strike, we needed to travel by air instead. This change was handled without a trouble. Tour guides were always prompt and efficient in getting us to the required locations. The choice of hotels offered by Breakfree Adventures allows us to choose a variety of accommodations. In each instance, the hotel personnel were helpful, efficient, and friendly. Rooms were always ready upon our arrival, clean, and above our expectations.Also, during this 7 days tours, there were several misplaced items amongst members of our group - our bag, passports, and even a camera were mistakenly left in hotel rooms. In each case, the items were retrieved by a Breakfree Adventures representative and either brought to us or sent to our next destination.The tour guides were superb, especially Ramesh. We could count on the tour guides to provide us with the local history, culture as well as shopping and restaurant tips, and visits to the local market.We loved every aspect our Nepal tour and appreciate all that everyone at Breakfree Adventures Nepal did to make our journey an excellent. Maybe even the best and we are experienced travelers. We already planning a trip to Ghorepani - Poon Hill and with Breakfree Adventures will be the only travel consultant we contact for assistance!Thank you so much!Kelly and Friends!!"

From the very first email, Bharat was always quick to respond with answers to questions regarding the itinerary, bookings, hotel arrangements, visa and flight information, etc. We were very happy to learn that Bharat would join us on our tour. Our hotels, chosen from the government list which included the Metta Spa and Resort, Meri Puensam, and Peaceful Resort, were charming with clean, large rooms, hot showers, and wonderful food for breakfast and dinner. Our lunches at local restaurants were also excellent. We were pleasantly surprised by the variety, freshness, and delicious preparation of every meal. Our tour guide, Bull, was extremely knowledgeable regarding the history and customs of past and present Bhutan. Our driver, Tenzin, was extremely proficient at maneuvering through the winding, mountainous roads, always making us feel comfortable and safe. We shared meals with Bharat, Bull, and Tenzin which only added more enjoyment to our trip, since we came to know more about the personal lives of the Bhutanese whose incredible country everyone should come to know. We do recommend to everyone that the hike to Tiger's Nest be taken a few days after arriving so the body adjusts to the altitude change. Our 22 year old son made it up to the Nest and back in three hours total time with Bull on the second day of our visit. But then again, he is 22 and his parents are NOT...Overall, Breakfree Adventures is a sure winner when considering a trip to the most glorious of countries, Bhutan. Contact Bharat and discover true, personal service at its best."

A well reputed travel agency in Nepal located in center of Thamel with lots of knowledgeable people and organize rewarding holidays to Nepal. We had a great time in Pokhara and Chitwan even it is monsoon season. Ramesh was very professional guide, and the hotels they use exceed our expectations even we pay less. The road between these locations are not good at all but it is not fault of Breakfree Adventures however they gave us the option of flying to Pokhara or Chitwan to Kathmandu and we choose driving options to fit our budget for this holiday. We have already committed with Breakfree Adventures that we will refer all our friends to them plus we will definitely back to Nepal for easy hiking next year. You will have great time with them for sure."

The guides worked very hard to allow us to have space and at the same time provide any level of explanation which we desired concerning many varied and exotic topics. Where do you start to describe the adventure? My wife and I flew over the Himalayas and got to enter the cockpit where I actually stood when the plane turned towards Mt. Everest. It was spectacular. Unfortunately if you come to Nepal in late May or beyond, the Monsoon is just around the corner and we were denied ground level views of Everest from Nagarkot. Chitwan was great. We saw 10 rare one horned rhinos. One even charged our jeep but was driven off by a very brave tour guide. We saw a sloth bear that was digging into a termite hill and a variety of crocodiles in the streams. There were more bird species than one could count. Our guide in Chitwan, Hari, was the best that anyone could imagine. He arranged a very special tour on elephant back, so we could leave the noisy tourists and get a very intimate look at the jungle. In Pokhara we were again denied a very good view of the Annapurna Range, but things cleared up enough one evening to get a very good impression of just how majestic these mountains are. Amazing! I could go on and on. Please look to the pictures I posted and from others. They are indicative of what you have to look forward to. I would very much recommend Breakfree to anyone who would visit Nepal. They will take care of the details and ensure that you receive the level of service that you pay for."

It was a private trip and Krystyna who organised it thought it would be a bit of an adventure if in doing the Manaslu Circuit we could also do Tsum Valley. She researched local companies and decided on Breakfree Adventures. After the trek one realises how important it is to do the research before booking.In my view I found Breakfree Adventures to be a highly professional company. Bharat the manager couldn\u2019t have been more helpful in organising the trek to our specifications and being ever vigilant to our needs while we were in Nepal.The guide Ramesh, the Sherpas the kitchen staff and the pony handlers did a marvellous job. Putting up tents, cooking meals (tasty and lots of it), serving us, even on some occasions one of the kitchen staff would meet us on the track with a warm drink. For all our needs I found the staff to be patient conscientious and caring.Ramesh was incredible. He was very dutiful, watchful and when needed went that extra distance. Unfortunately two of our group had to be helicoptered out through no fault of Breakfree. Ramesh on both occasions in organising the helicopters went to great efforts to get our companions out as soon as possible. On one occasion he made a helipad with his bare hands. On another occasion he dashed from one small village down to another so he could make contact. When our companions were flown to Kathmandu Bharat was very attentive, booking them into an appropriate hospital and maintaining almost constant contact while they were in hospital and on their discharge. I can only give full praise to Ramesh the Sherpas and Kitchen staff in taking care of us throughout the trek.I would highly recommend Breakfree Adventures to anyone who wishes to experience the beauty of Nepal or any other places that Breakfree Adventures operates in."

Firstly there was Bharat, who eased the way for us in these unfamiliar surroundings. He personally escorted us to and from the airport and booked us into local tours before and after the trek. He went out of his way to accommodate all the needs of two of us who had to be evacuated by helicopter. I was one of them, stricken by altitude sickness on day 17. He dealt with the hospital and the insurance issues, and organised accommodation and activities for me over the few remaining days before driving me to meet up with my fellow trekkers at the final camp. Then there was Ramesh, our guide, who was unfailingly good-humoured, efficient, conscientious and patient with us at all times, and handled the few emergencies that arose with admirable resourcefulness. And the porters, cooks, and general camp helpers, who carried enormous loads on their backs, strapped onto their foreheads, striding past us as we plodded at a much slower pace along the trail. And finally the line of sixteen gentle, patient donkeys and their minders, who bore our luggage and all the camp paraphernalia. All-in-all it was an unforgettable experience and I have already recommended Breakfree Adventures to friends considering such activities in the future."

This was my second tour with Bharat and his team , they looked after us so well last year and so I returned with another friend to see more of the country. In advance we gave Bharat a rough idea of what we wanted to do and see in the 13 days that we planned to visit , we opted for the medium priced budget accomodations. The itinery gave us time in Kathmandu , Pokhara and Chitwan , we enjoyed them all. The range of activities that he planned for us were varied and included , city tours , a 5 day trek in Annupurna region , paragliding in Pokhara , elephant safari and canoe trip in Chitwan , then back to Kathmandu for Everest flight , cultural dance evening and souvenir shopping . Bharat and his team looked after us , nothing was too much trouble . Ramesh was our guide for the 5 day trek , with Shondra our porter , Ramesh' guide psychology and encouragement helped me complete the trek - they even gave me a certificate of my achievement . The accomodations were varied , some more \"rustic\" than others , all had hot water for showers and menus to suit even fussy eaters.Everyone we met was so friendly , there was quite a camaraderie amongst the trekkers , comparing aches and pains , blisters etc .The local people we met were all very welcoming with big smiles . Nepal itself is a beautiful country , I intend to go back hopefully later this year. I wont hesitate to get Bharat to plan my next trip."

Namaste!Dear Bharat,It is time that I wrote to thank you for everything you did to ensure the success of my trek, I realise now that a 25 day trek was a huge undertaking but it was one of the best experiences of my life. The choice of guide and porter was vital and Ram, the guide, was outstanding. His English was first-rate and he was excellent at making sure that I was having a good time. He encouraged me when needed and left me alone at other times. He was full of useful information and I soon realised that his judgement was always good. When he suggested that we stop to have lunch, it meant that we needed a rest before tackling something or other! Several other trekkers commented on how efficient and thoughtful he was and I noticed that many people asked him for advice or information, rather than their own guides. Many trekkers were unhappy with their guides so I was delighted that Ram was so helpful, informative and supportive.Nurbu, the porter, was amazing; at times I lost sight of him and wondered where he was - only to discover that he had taken a short-cut and was way ahead of us. He was always helpful and light-of-heart; he managed my rucsac with no problems.Your organisation was excellent, as well. I didn't believe it when you appeared with my permit for Mustang in Muktinath; you had promised to get it to me but I didn't realise, even then, what a long and hard journey it was to reach a place so far from Kathmandu. You seemed to enjoy it, too!Please feel free to use what I have written as a recommendation. As a 60 year old lady, this trek could have been impossible; it was totally due to your organisation and your choice of people that I completed it and enjoyed every day. It was often tough but I never doubted that I would complete the trek.I will try to send you some photos but I am not sure how fast the connection it. I will wend them separately.Yours,Pat SmithUK"

Nepal is chaotic, especially Kathmandu and the airport. We were very pleased that we chose a guide rather than do it on our own as we normally would. Bharat was very helpful in organising the trip including timetable changes. Also very useful in assisting with updates on flights in Nepal as weather conditions made things difficult. Our actual guide was Ramesh. He was just outstanding. Very knowledgeable and patient. He knew when to talk and when to let us enjoy the serenity. They were very flexible in how we spent our time each day. They assisted with shopping and showed a nice restaurant where we ate several times. Nepal is not an advanced country, there are frequent power shortages, the internet is unreliable, the pollution in Kathmandu is very bad so be prepared for that. But it is a wonderful country to visit.I constantly think of the high mountains and the truly magnificent scenery - and I haven't forgotten the climb into Namche Bazaar, talk about hard work. The flight to and from Lukla is not to be missed, especially the take-off from Lukla. A truly wonderful holiday and we will be back. An excellent guide company and I totally recommend."

I dream to do this from years and started collecting information for this trek from last year. I was a bit worried at first to choose local agency as I never visited this country before thus I did speak with my friends who had done their recent trek and their travel experience of Ghorepani Ghandruk Trekking with Breakfree Adventures which gave me confident to choose Nepal based company.I had a wonderful experience with Breakfree Adventures. My Guide Puna and Porter citalang were very excellent. They look after me very well. Great hospitality, personal care and professionally guided. I am very glad to choose this company for my Ghorepani Ghandruk trek organized by most professional team. I am planning to back Nepal and take another trek with this company with my parents next year and would not hesitate to choose Breakfree Adventures again.Emily from Taipei, Taiwan"

Overall, my friend and I had a wonderful trip and great experiences both on the \"business\" side with Bharat and with our guide Ramesh. \"Business\" SideBharat was very responsive with emails and helping determine good options for our time frame. Payment was mostly straightforward, but I'd recommend not using PayPal as it looked like it hit Break free with a large fee. We ended up with an extra day in Kathmandu due to reasons detailed below, and Bharat was very helpful in changing reservations and getting us a driver.TrekWow!!! Langtang is beautiful, and highly recommend this area for a more off the beaten path experience. Given it was March and a less popular trekking region, we had trails to ourselves and mostly empty tea houses. Ramesh was everything you could ask for in a guide: professional, fun (we played lots of rummy and \"donkey\" at night), and knowledgeable. Given that a large part of the experience is dependent on your guide, I can't stress enough how lucky we felt to have Ramesh with us. He definitely seemed top tier relative to other guides we met on the trail. He was always making sure we were in-taking enough calories (Orange \"tea\" and cookies became a nice way to finish up the days hike) He also was very cognizant of weather, and had us skip a day of trekking around Lake Gosainkunda due to an unexpected 6 inches of snow. He did a good job of communicating this later on and working with Bharat to plan a day in Kathmandu. With that said, Ramesh also met us at the airport and was our \"in town\" tour guide. Great all around!Misc:My friend and I are both males ~ 30 years of age and in pretty good shape. We carried our own packs and still finished most stretches of the trek in 20-30% less time than Ramesh seemed to normally go. (He of course has no problems with any pace!) Had we known this, we may have tried to do a longer (distance) wise trek ahead of time."

We are both in agreement that it is (by far) the most beautiful country we have ever visited. The people were so kind and hospitable, and the sights throughout the trek were absolutely breathtaking. If you are looking for time away from a concrete jungle, the Annapurna trek is definitely your best choice. The Rhododendron forests were absolutely magical. So much green and supernatural beauty. Our senses were incredibly spoiled! Nepal was the perfect escape destination we needed after spending the past 7 months in dry, dusty, hot Kuwait. We were very happy with our guide, Romess, and our porter, Chandra. Romess had a lovely warm spirit and eagerness to ensure that we were always happy. Chandra's fun-loving, enthusiastic character made it impossible not to enjoy his company. His strength and perseverance completely astounded us.Dhonyabaad to Breakfree for an incredible experience. We are highly recommending treks in Nepal (with Breakfree Adventures, of course) to all of our friends, and we look forward to visiting Nepal again sometime in the future.Holly and Martina"

When I arrived, I had issues getting access to my cash, and no currency exchange at the airport would accept my Indian Rupees to convert to an accepted currency to pay for my Visa. Breakfree met me outside and gave me a huge bailout so that I could get my Visa worry-free and just added it on to my bill at the end. All my transportation was reliable and on-time, the accommodation was cost-sensitive yet great, and the sub-contracted company provided high quality bikes that were well-maintained with a great guide who spoke good English. The whole package including all pickup/drop-off, accommodation, bike, guide, etc. was less than $600. Very reliable and safe...highly recommend."

I knew my guide Ramesh Duwadi from two years ago, as well as Bharat Sapkota who now manages Breakfree Adventure Travel. From planning all the details through online chats and e-mails, I could not have asked for better or more responsive service. I started the trek with my friend Dennis who, unfortunately, had to drop out after 6 days of struggling with sleeplessness caused by altitude sicknes. We took him to the hospital in Lukla. Bharat was able to get him on a flight to Kathmandu and on to the U.S. the same day. For the rest of the trip, Ramesh and our porter Suria continued to do everything possible to make my experience unforgettably beautiful. Suria always had a welcoming smile when we talked, particularly when I struggled up the infamous Chola Pass. When I had to change the itinerary because bronchitis prevented my from going to Gorak Shep, Ramesh helped me by carrying my day pack for the rest of the trip. When we got to Lukla, hoping to fly out, we got stuck for 7 days because of dense fog. Ramesh made sure I lacked no comfort available.

From the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu along with a cultural evening, to the peace and tranquility of trekking to Sarangkot. From sightseeing in Pokhara to elephant riding at Chitwan and finally the fantastic views while flying over Everest. Our 7 day adventure was brilliant! We could not possibly have seen so much without the help of Bharat from Break Free Travel who organised everything."

Kathmandu is an amazing place, with all its temples, stupas, worshippers , traffic, shops spilling on to the narrow roads in the Thamel district. The friendly Nepalese to help you when you get lost, and you will, the history of it all and the peaceful way so many faiths co-exist is a lesson to the world. But although the guide books tell you to haggle on prices, do you really want to bearing in mind their standard of living compared to yours? A yak wool shawl that takes one person 10 days to make- how much should you pay for it, how much would you want to be paid for 10 days work? Strongly advise going vegetarian and beware lassi a yogurt drink( i may have got Salmonella from it, or other food at a banquet)Use a city guide to explain the customs and get the most out of a day's visit,& they expect a good tip. Fog stops flights frequently though so leave some flexibility in your return flight home !Kantipur Temple House is a great place to stay, beautiful architecture, good food and an atmosphere of peace and tranquility which is great after the noise and explosion of sounds, smells and sights which bombard the senses. A lovely place to chill out and refresh the soul."

When we arrived in the office all the staff were very friendly and helped us with any quires we had about the trip, this was excellent as it made us feel that everything had been perfectly planned and we were in to have an amazing trek. Kalos, our sherpa was brilliant. He always had a lovely big smile on his face when he came to collect our bags and was always great to talk to. He also gave us excellent advise for when we were trekking in the mountains. We both have great respect for the job he does, as it is not easy to walk in the mountains carrying just a day bag let alone both of our luggage. Gadul, our guide was just fantastic. His wealth of knowledge about the mountain range was amazing and any question we ever had, he was always more than happy to answer them. You could tell he is an experienced guide. Gadul made our trip so enjoyable, not only was he a wonderful guide that made us feel safe and at home in the mountains, he was such a lovely person. He again always had a great big smile on his face to greet us in the morning. On the trek we were constantly laughing and enjoying Gadul\u2019s company and he would always go above and beyond to make sure we were well looked after and happy. I recommend this trip to anyone, it really was a trip of a life time and Himalayan Glacier were such an amazing company to go with!"

My friend and I joined a 12-day custom \u201cluxury\u201d trek to Ama Dablam Base Camp in Nepal organized by Himalayan Glacier. This was my second trip to Nepal organized by HGT, and they made planning this trip extremely easy. We were not disappointed by their professional service. HGT developed a custom itinerary for us, answered all of our emails promptly and executed every detail of the trip. We had an unforgettable experience; our guide Gadul Tamang is very experienced and knowledgeable about the Khumbu region and mountain ranges. He always provided great assistance to us and ensured we were comfortable throughout the whole trip! We would definitely choose HGT and guide Gadul Tamang again!The trek itself was beautiful, the views and weather were great and we got to see some amazing views of the Himalayas and Ama Dablam. The six nights in \u201cluxury\u201d accommodation with private bathroom and warm shower were definitely a treat. We stayed at the Yeti Mountain Lodge in Phakding and Thame; and the Everest Summit Lodges at Pangobche, Monjo and Lukla. During the other nights we stayed in traditional tea houses.I would highly recommend HGT, our guide Gadul Tamang and this trek to Ama Dablam."

This October my friend and I had an amazing experience trekking to Ama Dablam base camp with Himalayan Glacier (trekking). Himalayan Glacier organized a private luxury lodges tour for us from Lukla through Namche, Thame, Khumjung, Portse and Pangboche to Ama Dablam base camp and, of course, back. The amazing experience was enhanced by fantastic weather and the best guide we've trekked with - Gadul Tamang. Gadul was always very friendly, kind and attentive. The company, Himalayan Glacier was very responsive when booking the trip. They tailored the trip to our time schedule, preferences and style. For most of the trek we followed the typical Everest Base Camp trek, or Everest Luxury Lodges/View trek. Except, we did not go all the way to base camp but rather visited Ama Dablam Base camp from Pangboche and trekked back. We added Thame to the itinerary. We loved visiting Thame. It is not often on the typical Everest BC trek. We highly recommend this addition. One of the most charming Sherpa villages. Along the trek, from Namche, thru Portse and Pangboche and on the way to Ama Dablam BC we had amazing views of Everest, Lhotse, Lhotse Char, Nuptse and Ama Dablam itself. We highly recommend this 11 day itinerary and the luxury lodges. The views are spectacular. The lodges we used were the Yeti Montain lodges and the Everest Summit Lodges. We also highly recommend Himalayan Glacier and Gadul Tamang. They provided outstanding service and a most memorable experience. We loved our trek and time In the Everest region. We'll definitely return again."

Thanks to Naba the organiser and the company owner, Karma excellent , helpful and flexible tour guide and a very friendly and accommodating driver Pema. I highly recommend Himalayan glacier trekking with out any hesitation. They were very prompt and quick in getting back to our queries. once we shared our trip duration, hotel locations and standard we prefer, Naba was very good in finding and recommending perfect hotels for us. We had six days trip to Bhutan visiting Paro, Thimpu,punakha and two days bhumdra trek- with overnight stay at a very luxurious camp site at 4000 metres height. We couldn't believe they managed to provide us double bed and mattress in a tent at that height. Camp was very clean and maintained to high standard. Every hotels they booked for us were of highest quality standard, food was amazing and they were located in beautiful nature. We only wished we had extra day in every hotel we visited. Trip was organised so well we never felt rushed in any place. We had ample to spend in each location visiting local attractions and shopping as well. Team were very helpful in understanding our needs and pointed us in the right direction for food, shopping , places of attraction etc. we received excellent service and we certainly will use their again in future with out a doubt. We did not do any water sports or biking, if we had the time we would certainly consider adding that to our itinerary. Bumdra trek requires moderate fitness and you can hire porter to carry your stuff . No need to carry sleeping bags for trek as they provide everything you need, you just need to carry clothes to change , tooth brush and paste, water and snacks , ( they provide breakfast, lunch and dinner)"

Initially our flight to Lukla was cancelled due to bad weather, and Tulsi conveniently arranged for us to be flown by helicopter when there were no other options available.

Frankly speaking my expectation were not such as high as my experience from travelling in Asia framed me in a certain way.

Even if it is possible to explore one\u2019s own way during the lower level hills (up to 3.800 m) of Nepal the taking care of the team of Himalayan Glacier simply let us feel relaxed and provided a hunch of luxury. It is definitely worthwhile to spend the money here. Thank you to the MD Mr. Narayan Regmi who did not want to miss the chance for a personal exchange of ideas and information by inviting us to a gorgeous dinner once being back to Kathmandu. The professionalism and personal taking care of only two of us before, during and after the hike let us think to come back ASAP \u2026 the Annapurna Base Camp tour is waiting \u2026 Thanks again to all who made this trekking trip such an unforgettable event to us."

It was with some trepidation I left my wife (she was volenteering in Kathmandu) and put myself totally in the hands of the Himalayan Glacier team on the 23rd May for a trek to EBC via Gokyo lakes. Conventional wisdom suggests that the end of May / beginning of June is the start of the monsoon season and signals the end of both the climbing and trekking season - but this also opens up the opportunity to experience this fantastic trail as nature intended - uncluttered footpaths and mountains with only the occasional clashes of other Trekkers and tourists. With the right apparel either umbrella (as our guide carried) or \u00a3300+ breathable coat (I may re-think my wardrobe) the occasional shower was a small price to pay for the peace and tranquillity of the trail. Our trekking team of myself, Mel and Lucy coupled with our two porters and guide, Gadul + (sorry guys can't remember how to spell your names), we soon established a comfortable but hard pace and easy enjoyable bantering, which added greately to the trip.The organisation of the whole enterprise was exceptional, great advice from the guide, exceptional support from the porters and excellent tea house stop overs to rest weary limbs before each day. This was exemplified when at the end of the trek we found our flight back to Kat cancelled and the guide and team back at head office arranged helicopter recovery for us - thus avoiding missed international flights back home.My advice to anyone considering this trek is \"stop considering and get booking - you won't be disappointed\" however do read all the kit list carefully and do come prepared, I'd definitely recommend DIY water purification and a trip to the docs for a course of antibiotics just in case ;-) .My last piece of advice is don't forget your cards, dhumbal is compulsory, but please be warned cheating also needs to be practiced - anything from chanting mantras to concealing jokers is fair game :-).Lastly a big thanks to all the team, joking apart, this has been one of the best experiences of my life and I really don't think I could have enjoyed myself anymore with a different company or trekking buddies. When I return to Nepal to trek some more of the Himalayas it will be with Himalayan Glacier."

Taking in account that it was my first visit I decided for the second option.The decision of choosing the right company to go around was sensitive. I decided for Himalayan Glacier. Their personal service, the concept of responsibility, the pacification from the airport to all places visited and hotels, made this trip and unforgettable experience for the family."

We were supposed to come last year but due to the earthquake, we rescheduled for this year. Sangita and Sneha were very helpful and responsive during the planning phase and were very responsive to emails. In fact, not too long after the earthquake occurred, they were in contact with me since our scheduled arrival was within 2 weeks and they offered to reschedule our trip for this year at last years price. We did a trekking trip through the Annapurna Sanctaury (with its never-ending steps!) with our guide Tulsi, who was very good. Based on my husband's interest in birds, he suggested we visit Chitiwan National Park after our trek and made all the arrangements for us at a very reasonable price. We also had a couple of day tours in Kathmandu arranged by Himalayan Glacier, which were nice. I would highly recommend Himalayan Glacier and visiting Nepal. It's safe and rebuilding is under way after the earthquake."

The hotel was fine and I was invited to awkward welcome dinner with tour guide who seemed to not want to be there. I signed up for volunteering days and said from get go I would like to work with kids. When I got to HGT office, they kept pushing construction work on me and when I said I wanted to work with kids and said this from beginning they didn't have a plan.When I was sent to town in Gokura, I was told it would be a bus. It was a death trap for 5 hours where 23 people were crammed on a 15 seat bus and the driver was darting through winding mountain roads. If you google bus accidents and Nepal, they are monthly and due to overcrowdeding and poor driving. HGT showed little regard for my health and well being.When I got to Gokura, I met with a tour guide and I demanded to speak with his boss and I said I was never told I would be put in such an unsafe bus. He then tried to flip it on me and say I wasn't up for experiencing life like a local. I said I refused to ride another bus like that and demanded a private driver or safe ride, which he said was not possible and we had to cancel the volunteering portion.I wasted a day in a non-air conditioned hotel HGT placed me in with poor service and a thin mat for a mattress. It was pitched to me as best hotel in town aka cheapest for them to maintain their margins off me.We agreed to do a trekking trip for four days and the guide and sherpa were cool.I spent a few extra days in Pokhra and then returned to Kathmandu. The manager insisted on meeting me at my hotel at 8:30 AM to discuss my trip. I agreed but he then no showed. When I called him later, he said he was there, but I was asleep. I called him out and said I was sitting there in the small lobby at agreed upon time. After I told him this, there was a long pause and no response.I then asked him, why he was lying to me. He said he called and hotel staff said I was asleep and I said no, I was eating breakfast in area visible from lobby. He couldn't keep his story straight.All they care about it money. Lied to me. Had no regard for my safety and well being. You can get guides and find groups once you arrive in Kathmandu at a much cheaper price than HGT. I felt like they took me for a ride and were full of crap.I know they have good reviews, but I am telling my story to let people know my own experience and the disorganization and cost cutting they used that put my well-being and life at risk."

We soon found that Himalayan Glacier Trekking (HGT) was the obvious choice. They have been around for 24 years and we couldn't find a bad review on the internet. We started planning well over a year before we decided to travel. We filled out the online request for the EBC Luxury Lodge Trek offered by HGT, and in less than 12 hours we had heard back. Our first contact was with Urusha, her emails told us what we needed and explained everything we could expect on our trek. Urusha was amazing, she was more than someone on the other end of an email, she wanted to make sure we were well taken care of and there were no issues with our planning. Even after the earthquake, when we were concerned about Urusha and everyone at HGT, she contacted us to say that communications had been disrupted, but they were still working hard to make our trip the best experience possible. We were blown away by this company's dedication to our needs. When we arrived in Kathmandu, we were met at the airport by our guide, Asabir (Asi) who was to take care of us at every turn, not only on the trek, but from start to finish.First on the schedule was a tour of Kathmandu, which was included in the package. Our tour guide, Dipesh, was exceptional. He was incredibly knowledgable and gave us plenty of time to explore on our own. After the tour, we met again with Asi and Mr. Regmi, the Managing Director of HGT, to go over final preparations for the trek. Mr Regmi was wonderful. He would check in by phone every couple of days while we were on the trek to see how everything was going and to make sure we were enjoying the trek. The next morning, Asi met us at the hotel, and our trek began. We flew from Kathmandu to the Tensing-Hillary airport in Lukla. We met our porter, Bok Tao, another exceptional individual, and we were on our way. Asi is the best! Every aspect of the trek was taken care of by Asi. He made sure that our trek would be memorable but also safe. It was just us on the trek, so we were able to go at our own pace. Asi has over 15 years experience and knew the name of every mountain, glacier, village and almost every person we met. He encouraged us everyday and his knowledge and support were the reason this trek exceeded our expectations. Thanks to Asi, we made it to EBC and had a wonderful time.I've never dealt with a company who has such a complete understanding of customer service. Their dedication to giving clients the best experience possible and to their well being is rarely found. The HGT team is the best."

The trek to Everest Base Camp was an interesting warm up before climbing Lobuche East Peak. We also climbed Kala Patthar down the valley from Everest Base Camp to help the acclimatisation process and get some stunning photos of the landscape. Lobuche East Peak itself I found to be a challenging climb as it is quite steep, but with the help of Chaweng the climbing guide and some fixed ropes I made it to the top without too much difficulty! I would definitely climb with Himalayan Glacier again....I highly recommend them!"

I honestly could go on and on about every detail of my trek and how much fun it was, especially doing it with such an incredible guide (Babu)..but I think you should find out for yourself and just book your trip with these guys!! So professional, so helpful, so accommodating and have just made some of the best memories forever!! You won't be disappointed!!!"

We were extremely surprised with the level professionalism we received from the agency. They gave us a clear itinerary and clear gear list required for the trip. At arrival we were greeted by our guide who took us to the hotel to check-in and from there we went to their head office for a briefing session. We met with the managers Narayan who clearly explained the next steps and the procedures. Then we made our way to a charming restaurant were we had a Nepalese traditional dish \"Dal pat\". Next morning we took an early flight from Kathmandu to pokhara, from Pokhara then the agency had organised for cars (4 wheel) to take us to our trekking starting point. The agency made bookings for us in tea houses. Some of the teahouses were good and some we extremely poor. We felt that they have chosen some terrible ones (on the way back) in order to make a bit saving. We felt that way because we were comparing the teahouses around the one we stayed in and they were a lot cleaner. Our guide Tulsi was a bit rushed in the beginning, we understand that he is pressured with a schedule that he had to follow. We thought that was a bit annoying and defeated the purpose of a hike where we can relax and forget about time... after couple of days he was less pressured so we all started enjoying the trek a lot more. Overall Tulsi was professional supportive and well knowledgable about the country. We had a bit of a challenge communicating with his assistance due to the language barrier. Also, at the end of the trip we stayed with the assistance and he had organized for a pick up with in a small car, when we asked the reasons why he blamed on a new rule (and we know that our friends returns in a big car) we felt again in that situation that they were trying to make a bit of saving. We insisted on getting a big car, simply because the small car in these roads was not the safest option. After we insisted they eventually managed to get us a jeep. Overall we would highly recommend Himalayan Glacier for whoever is planning a trekking experience in Nepal. We will definitely use the agency again."

We are in our 30s, are usually independent travellers and have trekking experience, but we decided we wanted some help with this trek. We wanted to have someone with experience who knows the side trails off the sections of jeep road, as well as some help carrying one of our backpacks. We decided a porterguide would be the best solution for us, and we then spent a long time researching agencies to arrange the porterguide. There are so many agencies to choose from, and we're so glad we chose Himalayan Glacier. Within only a few days of our planned departure date for the trek, we went into the HG office and met with Naba, the manager. We were worried about having to fend off an upsell to an organized tour, but Naba was amazing! We explained what we wanted, which included a flexible itinerary, only one staff to help us, and that we have final say about the route and which lodges we would stay at. Naba was entirely agreeable, and made the whole process very easy. He set us up with a porterguide and made a meeting time for the introductions for a couple days later. He also arranged our trekking permits and transportation to the trailhead (by public bus, as we had requested). The price for the agency's services was very reasonable and competitive. Naba also arranged for us VERY warm sleeping bag and down jacket rentals, at half the price that we had been quoted in the stores. Then we threw in a last minute challenge for Naba. With only 15 hours until departure, we decided we wanted a porter to carry the second bag. We emailed Naba, and he had no problem graciously accommodating this last minute change of plans. In fact, he got us a second porterguide. The trek far exceeded our already high expectations. The circuit was absolutely breathtaking. Our two porterguides, Sanjib and Gokul, were AMAZING. They were friendly, fun, easygoing, and took great care of us. Sanjib has a lot of experience with the circuit, and knows the trail very well. Gokul has less experience, but speaks better English. Although we had wanted to have final say on the lodges, we were always happy to go with Gokul and Sanjib's recommendations. They always found the best places, and always managed to get the best rooms for us. Having good connections definitely helps! We really had an incredible time with Sanjib and Gokul, and are glad to now count them as friends. We hope to return to Nepal in the future for more trekking, and without question we will arrange it again with Himalayan Glacier."

            "review": "ABC Base Camp Trek. My wife, 6 year old son Ethan and I trekked with Himalayan Glacier in March of 2016. They went as far as Tadapani and headed down while I trekked all the way up to ABC Camp. This has long been a dream vacation of mine having seen friends pictures years ago of their trek to EBC. After careful consideration and with MUCH help from Sristi in the Kathmandu office, we settled on ABC. And boy am I glad we did. The scenery and people were amazing!!! What a phenomenal experience in all ways - the highlight of our recent Asia trip in my opinion. Love the Nepalese people - warm, caring and loving. And it all started with Sristi in the head office. I probably sent her 100-150 emails in preparation of this trip and she never failed to answer all my questions and calm any concerns I might have. She was amazing and invaluable! Then we met the manager. A fantastic guy who was not just concerned about our money but about our safety! A wonderful man who called the hotel that my wife and son were staying at to see how they made out as I ascended higher. From there we had the opportunity to meet our Guide and Porters. I cannot say enough good things about these men. Shankar, our trekking guide is the type of guy you could trust with your life or your 6 year old son's. He is very knowledgeable, caring (safety first) and fun loving. He was like a brother to me by trek's end. My family had a hard time saying good bye to him when we departed Nepal. Ram, one of our porters, was as strong as an ox and as loving as a grandfather type. Both of these guys were my soulmates as I trekked up to ABC camp, attending to any needs I might have and providing advice and companionship along the way. I can't say enough good things about them. My wife and son were looked after by porters named Gopal and Sanjib. My wife could not say enough good things about them. They really looked after my family, especially when Ethan got a dose of TD coming down the mountain. They showed geniune concern for my family and my son reallly bonded with them both. They became like members of my family. The whole Himalayan Glacier Company can be best described as a Family Operation. it is impossible to not feel connected to these people. Yes, it is a business, but they make it feel like a family. You absolutely must utilize this company if you are planning a trek of the Himalayas. You will not be disappointed. I certainly was not. I would rate my entire experience an 11 out of 10. I am planning to go back and do EBC in a couple of years. Can't wait. And I will insist on using the same crew-from Sristi, to Shankar to Ram, Gopal and Sanjib. Thank you HG for an amzing experience. P.S. The earthquake effects or fuel issues with India were in no way felt by our family. It was not an issue at all. Nepal is ready to accomodate. And with HG's hospitality, you will be in family like hands."

The experience was so wonderful, I decided to return to Nepal to try an Everest Base Camp hike. I was concerned about the conditions in Nepal after the earthquake and the fuel shortage and wondered if Himalayan Glacier would be able to provide the same level of service. I emailed Naba to inquire about the trip and the region's safety. His quick reassurance convinced me to sign up for the new trip. I was met at the airport by Dol Amgai, the same guide who cared for me on my Annapurna trip. He is such an asset to the company as he smooths the way at every turn. I cannot imagine trying the challenging hike without his expert knowledge, local contacts and direction. He is a friendly and fun person who cares from the heart about his clients' health and safety. With his support, I happily achieved my 3 goals for the trip...experience the flight to Lukla, reach Everest Base Camp and see some yaks. Dol is no longer just a guide that we hired to help us, he is a true friend that I'll always remember! Thank you to Naba, Dol and the company for making this trip of a lifetime so special. Yes, beautiful Nepal is safe! Go...now! :-)"

We planned our EBC trek over a two year period (the 2015 earthquake caused us to postpone our trek until March 2016). We selected Himalayan Glacier through a trekking friend's recommendation, and they fully exceeded all of our expectations with their responsiveness, thorough explanations in answer to our questions, and patience and reassurance with handling our concerns about safety, etc.Our trek was 'picture perfect'--no one got ill, no dysentery, no altitude sickness. We attribute our healthy trek from start to finish to our amazing guide, Giri (Dev Raj Giri). Giri, a very experienced guide, took extreme care to make sure that we were staying hydrated, eating properly (he insisted that we eat 3 meals a day even when we felt too tired to eat), recommending which foods to avoid at which lodging and lunch locations, and showing great sensitivity at handling our occasional headache. One of our group had a bout of tummy trouble at the beginning of our long day to reach EBC, and Giri worked with her, supporting her, and ensured that she healthily and successfully reached base camp. He is well-known to other guides and tea house/lodging staff, giving us added assurance that we were in the best of hands. He let us use his phone to call loved ones at home (US), too--eliminating the need for a SIM card or relying on the iffy wifi that was avaialble at some of the higher altitude inns. Jiri, our assistant guide, was a quiet and calming influence on our group, sometimes leading, often 'bringing up the rear' to complete the team effort. We saw beautiful vistas, amazing sights (an avalance in the disstance, yak 'trains' moving across thin trails, monks chanting at Tembouche Monastery). While we worked strenously to complete our trek, our guide's guidance and his uncanny ability to know what we needed (words of encouragement, assistance with carrying our daypacks, a Snickers bar when energy was failing) ensured that we completed the trek on time and safely.  We talked with many other trekkers during our trek and we were the only group that experienced no ill effects (tummy trouble, altitude sickness). We attribute it to the care and intelligent way that Himalayan Glacier operates--seasoned guides, known lodges, perfect pacing."

Himalayan Glacier was quick to respond via email and incredibly flexible in making an itinerary that suited our needs and budget. Once we arrived in Kathmandu, Narayan looked after us incredibly well - took us out to breakfast, introduced us to our guide and provided us with great advice. Our English speaking guide, Kewel, ensured our safety along the trail as well as answered all of our many questions about the culture, landscape and trek. While we met many people on the trail that didn't have a guide, I am incredibly satisfied with our choice to hire a guide - the information and ease of travel they are able to provide is invaluable and for a first time trek in Nepal we saw it as money well spent. I was so impressed when Narayan checked in on us throughout our trek to ensure everything was going well. I would highly recommend Himalayan Glacier Trekking, they treat their staff incredibly well and provide their customers with top level service! Note: If you plan on doing the Annapurna Circuit, try to go to Tilicho Lake if it is safe to cross and you feel comfortable crossing the rock slide. It made crossing the pass so much easier since we were able to acclimatize with the few extra days. Also try to trek the whole circuit if you have the time. Tourism has declined in some of the lower elevation villages with the construction of the road and they could really use the business!"

We organized the tour once we arrived in Kathmandu by talking to Naba, who gave us some great advice and catered the trip according to our time constraints and what we were interested in. There was only 2 of us and we had Babu as our guide. Babu is a top guide but because there were so few tourists in Nepal when we visited he was happy to work as our guide/porter - which meant he carried one of our bags and while still being an excellent guide. We really found our experience with Babu amazing. He enabled us to chat with all the locals we met along with way and gave us some good information about the area. He was also really easy to get along with, very friendly and looked out for our needs (and seemed very responsible and capable). You don't need a guide to do the Annapurna circuit (and this is the first time I have ever used a guide, and I do a lot of trekking) but I think the experience we gained with Babu was definitely worth it. I would also strongly suggest now is a great time to visit Nepal as there are so few tourists (and they are in need for tourists!). The Annapurna Circuit has a reputation for being so busy but when we went in December, the combination of the season, earthquake and fuel blockade, meant we were often the only people at the teahouses! December was a great time for trekking. It was cold, but beautiful weather. Highly recommend!"

We were able to customize our itinerary according to our requests with no problem. All of the logistics were handled seamlessly. Once we arrived, our tour guide and driver did everything possible to ensure we were comfortable and enjoying our trip. As vegetarians, aside from one small mixup, we were always presented with a range of food choices that met our dietary needs. The hotels (we opted for the standard, 3 star accommodation) were perfectly comfortable, although a bit breezy/cool in January, the middle of winter. All told, our trip to Bhutan was magical and the ease of working with Himalayan Glacier contributed greatly to this experience.

The route, far up near the border with Tibet, had been closed since the April 25 earthquake and its aftershock last year. The trek was not easy, but Himalayan Glacier stepped up and made it all run smoothly. Naba, one of the principal figures at Himalayan Glacier, met with me personally over lunch to see what my interests were. My guide, Ashish, helped me hunt for the best equipment, taking my limited budget into account. He handled all the permits and bus tickets, and was a genuine friend on the trek.Langtang itself has been hit hard by the earthquake. The aftermath is everywhere, and the entire village of Langtang is now sitting under rubble. This creates one part of the trek where it's highly advised to bring your own lunch, owing to a significant distance (6-8 hours) between meals. However, more people should really go on this trek, both to get a better sense of the devastation that has racked the country as well as help in the recovery. Every person who goes on this trek and visits Kyanjin Gumba is helping bolster the many families who are still living and working there.The view from any one of the peaks ringing Kyanjin Gumba is worth the trip, but the opportunity to help the community makes it a can't-miss. I thank Himalayan Glacier for giving me the opportunity to see this, for their unwavering support and commitment to what turned out to be an unforgettable experience."

He made sure we know all areas we will face when entering Tibet such as dealing with the change in climate given that we went in January. In addition, the potential of altitude sickness for the high elevation in Tibet. Overall, we had a great experience on the tour and the staffs were extremely nice and attentive to our well beings. Prior to the tour, we were always in contact with Vidya via email and she was great and responsive to all our inquiries and concerns. She was a big help in accommodating to all our requests and we were so happy to meet her in person in Kathmandu. In addition, I lost my wedding band at the hotel and we contacted Himalayan Glacier to ask them pick it up for us.

This year, I developed a personal agenda from relationships that arose from the 2014 visit, and I went off-script from the package tours to travel and do research of my own initiative. I contacted Mr. Narayan Regmi of HG and had him handle my in-country travel and lodgings. My trip was again an outstanding success. I accomplished visitations to Pokhara and locations in Gorkha District, did research on personal projects, and had no problems. Mr. Regmi brought me through baggage difficulties, changes in schedule, and always had a driver and vehicle available when I needed them. The flexibility I uncovered was an amazing surprise, given that repeat visits to a locale like Nepal would present specific interests not available in a programmed tour. Lay out your plans and let Himalayan Glacier facilitate your needs. Excellent experience!!"

Recently completed this trip with HGT, my second trek with them ([previous: Annapurna, 2010); as expected, it was very well-organized and the office staff answered many emailed questions in advance. Our chief guide Bimal was very experienced, having done this route at least 50 times before, in all seasons and all kinds of weather--any small problems were handled and solved along the way. Every detail of the trip is thought out in advance; I chose to bring my own sleeping bag but HGT supplied a down parka, which was definitely needed at night and at Base Camp.You won't find a better company than HGT--they've been at this for a long time and they have it down pat."

The sights were incredible, as expected. I will definitely return to the Himalayas either for the Island Peak trek or Anapurna, and will use Himalayan Glacier again."

Himalayan Glacier made my trip everything I had hoped for and more. Our guide, Rishi, picked us up at the airport and from that time on everything was taken care of for us. We hiked the Annapurna loop including Poon Hill and then the Everest Trail. Rishi was wonderful - brought coffee to our room in the morning, shared so much information about Nepal and everything we were seeing, answered the hundreds of questions we asked, gave us encouragement when we needed it, and was always patient and kind. He also has a wonderful sense of humor and we had fun and laughed a lot! I celebrated a birthday while hiking the Everest Trail and he even managed to have a birthday cake (with candles) for me when we arrived at our lodge that evening. Our porters, Prokash and Sumon, also did an amazing job. Our bags were always waiting for us, clean and dry, at our lodge.We also spent a week in Bhutan and had a wonderful time with our guide, Sonam, and driver Sangay. We visited monasteries that were hundreds of years old, and Sonam shared the history with us in such a way that we felt as though we were living it.I hope to go back to Nepal in the next year or so, and I will definitely go with Himalayan Glacier Trekking, and would love to have Rishi as our guide again."

We not only visited the cultural sights but also had private cars and really decent hotels in both Kathmandu and Pokhara. When the gas crisis affected some air travel, Naaryan was quick to refund us the difference in cost for driving. The entire time I felt like our guide Rissi was looking out for our best interests. In one instance we wanted to rent a motorcycle to go around the lake in Pokhara and Rissi negotiated down to a third of the price that the vendor wanted. Rissi even purchased a muda for me when I was paragliding and I absolutely love it (I paid him back immediately, of course). I would recommend all my family and friends to have a trip organized by Himalayan Glacier. I will do a Everest basecamp trek one day and would put my all my trust into Himalayan Glacier to get me there and back safely."

I can still not believe that I did them all. I couldn't do this without the help from my amazing guide Babu, who guided me true all difficult parts. Babu a big thank you for you, for being a good brother, taking good care for me. I will never forget. Also a big thanks to Naba for arranging my trip smoothly.Frequent asked questions:Is it safe to travel in the solo Kumbu area after the earthquake? YES! The trails are in a good condition. There was a small land-sliding area just before Cho La Pass, Babu guided me safely to the other side. You will not travel in this area if you do only EBC or Gokyo Ri. Teahouses which got damaged during the earthquake are repaired or rebuild.Is it safe to travel alone (female) with a guide?Yes this is no problem at all! My guide took excellent care for me and had professional manners. In the teahouses I had my own room.Why travel alone?You walk at your own pace. It is easy to meet people underway in the teahouses. It is also a great opportunity to build a friendship with your local guide. And yes, my guide spoke excellent English.Why a guide?A guide is there for your safety. If anything happens he will take care for you. He can show you 'inside' Nepal. He will arrange that everything goes smoothly.A wish came true by doing this hike. It was a life changing experience. Once again thank you so much. Warmest wishes to everyone from the HG-team. I wish you a great season & happy Dashain."

Unsure what to do, Himalayan Glacier emailed that they were resuming tours in late May. Not wanting to pass up this once in a lifetime opportunity (literally, we were both between jobs and had could spend the month travelling) we hopped on the plane and eventually landed in Kathmandu.We were the only ones that came, so it was just the two of us, our guide Tulsi, and our porter Rahm. Given the circumstances, the expertise of the entire Himalayan Glacier team was a welcome blessing. Due to risk of landslides, we changed our trek from the Everest base camp to Annapurna base camp. They made it clear that we had full control of our trek, but they acted as trusted advisers at every step. Tulsi knows all the owners of the lodges at each village and camp, and by reaching out to his network he knew exactly where we could go that would be safe, open, and good for a hot meal.Before our trek, we got a tour of some of the fantastic temples (unfortunately damaged by the earthquake) and sights of Kathmandu. Himalayan Glacier took care of the hotel (the lovely hotel Aryatara in our case), all the flights, and transportation & sightseeing. We were never left wanting, we had a driver, guides, and fantastic service at the hotel. Tulsi even took us out to the markets in Kathmandu and made sure we were properly equipped.In terms of treks, Annapurna may not have the same name appeal as Everest, but it's a beautiful region. Greener than the Everest trek, the lower altitudes are almost tropical . Plenty of wildlife, including monkeys, buffalo, ponies and burros, goats, as well as village cats and dogs. As you start to climb it gets cooler, and you have fantastic views. The ever-present landmark is Mount Machhapuchchhre (\"fishtail mountain\") names for it's unique identitiy.Stays at lodges are fun. Due to high vacancies, we typically got the best room in the house (with attached bathroom / shower). All the food is covered, and you'll be hungry. Dal Bhat is more or less the national food of Nepal, and I highly recommend it. We were coming up against the rainy season, but Tulsi was very good at getting us to the destination village before the afternoon rains. We didn't get rained on once.Due to landslide concerns, we didn't go all the way to Annapurna Base Camp (again, our choice, Tulsi was ready to take us if we desired), so we trekked around at the lower altitiudes. We ended our trek at Sarangkot, a village overlooking Pokhara. Instead of hiking back to the city, we gave all our things to Rham and Tulsi and then Parasailed down!All in all, it was an experience to last a lifetime. I can't recommend Himalayan Glacier enough, and will strive to make it back if I can ever get a month of again."

I'd love to do another trek with Hira, Padam and Bishow - can't thank these three enough for an amazing experience. We had to change our schedule in the 2nd half of the trek and it was seamless on our end; they took care of changing any lodging arrangements and worked out flight changes out of Lukla without us ever having to worry about it. They are very focused on health and safety, both for us and their crew, and they have a ton of knowledge of the mountains. It's not a cheap trip, but the value of what you're getting is well worth it (transportation in Kathmandu, flights in and out of Lukla, lodging and meals every day, and their expertise in the mountains to name a few). In terms of the Gokyo Ri trek itself, it's the most beautiful setting I've ever experienced. We did this in late march / early april and got to experience a wide variety of terrain (including snow). There are definitely some days of tough hiking in terms of climbs, but nothing technically challenging. A great trip for anyone looking for a beautiful trek."

When the internal flight i had requested could not be got ( but one 2 hrs later) they gave us a car and driver for a day in Kathmandu.from greet at airport to departure everything was perfect."

Of course there are agencies that offer lower prices, but if you care for good service, english speaking guides and a working back up in case of emergency, HG is the right agency for you. The office-team will work out a custom made trek. On the trek you won\u00b4t have to worry about a bed in a lodge even in high saison. There will be enough guides to split the group,if a member can not go on. The rescue service works. 3 people of my group were flown out without any hazle. I finished the trek and was treated like a VIP. Look for the HG website, the professional internet performance meets the practice."

Words cannot begin to express how I feel, and how grateful I am to the team at Himalayan Glaciers to have put together an error free and splendid trek for me along with my partners on trek ( 8th March 2015 ). the whole trek has been cast in fond memories which i shall cherish throughout and because of the trek and Himalayan Glacier have now developed a yearn to summit Sagarmatha !.Naba ( co founder and overall incharge of operations ) has put together an excellent organisation both in terms of customer delight ( not just satisfaction ) and the professional team of guides and support staff.Right from my very first interaction on email with Urusha from Himalayan Glacier i could tell by the way all my queries over the weeks were answered patiently and with all details that i had made the right choice in going with Himalayan for the trek. Urusha not just answered all my queries but was most helpful in providing various other inputs both with regards to trek and for things to do at Kathmandu.We were a group of 4 ( my Australian mate, a German and an Indian and all of us gelled and hit off the trek with fun and close bonding ) and were accompanied by Dol ( main guide ), Biru ( assistant guide ) and 2 porters ....so for the 4 trekkers we had an equal number of support staff !!!! Amazing....Dol has been the most clam and composed guide one could have asked for, his knowledge about the Himalayas, its people, the nature and the trek were beyond any fault. He took great care to ensure all our likes were catered to throughout the trek and at times he anticipated our needs in advance and had them met with in advance. Himalayan Glaciers is congratulated for having trained such exceptional staff. Biru the assistant guide, is another prized catch Himalayan Glaciers have and shall one day turn into an exceptional guide himself under Naba and Dol.We could tell from the places we stayed at and the kind of food we ate that we were \" royalty \" as we always had the best places with best rooms to stay and the food was exceptionally good ( i also made it a point to interact with chefs at all the places we stayed which meant we could all have food to our liking......).I can go on and on about the trek especially because everything was thought of and taken care by Himalayan Glaciers ( right from first interaction over emails to Welcome and farewell dinners and the trek in between...).I happen to be a very fussy person, however Himalayan Glacier have not once given me any time to complain about anything, cos there wasnt anything to complain upon....I do look forward to many more treks with them ...and congratulate the entire team on the exceptional work they all put in."

What a fantastic touring holiday we have just returned from.From booking our tour of Kathmandu, Nepal and the Himalayas through Himalayan Glacier's booking representative Sristi, who's response was always prompt, excellent information and a tour itinerary tailor made to suit our requests, to the many queries we had before and during our booking process, to our fantastic driver Laxman, who provided support and assistance at all times especially when we were delayed, at no time did we feel alone, or helpless, he provided an unfailing service which was above and beyond the call of duty. It was very comforting to know that this company was still there for us even after our tour had ended. Thank you so much Laxman for looking after us so well. Also our English Speaking tour guides all arranged by Himalayan Glacier, they were very informative, interesting and professional, at all times giving us a good insight into the country's culture and wonderful sights making each tour interesting and extremely enjoyable. Finally to mention the special care we received from Executive Director Naba when our flight was cancelled due to unpreventable circumstances at the airport.Naba arranged for us to stay at the same hotel, he liaised with the airline and kept us informed of any progress and when we might expect to get a flight. The car and driver was available to us for the whole of the delayed period, and it seems absolutely nothing is a bother to any of the staff but quite the very opposite, they all take the greatest of pleasure in giving their utmost assistance.Himalayan Glacier certainly excelled in in everything they did for us, an excellent, professional service from beginning to end with all members of staff. If we ever return to this wonderful part of the world we will have no second thoughts of booking with, HIMALAYAN GLACIER!"

Watched the sunrise light up the Himalayas, did a day trek to another overlook and enjoyed hot tea on the hotel roof top while watching the sunset. Enjoyed a half day tour of the sites and sounds of Pokhara; the lake, Davis Falls and cave, and enjoyed some of the best mandarins I've ever tasted. We then hopped a short flight from Pokhara back to Kathmandu and continued to enjoy some amazing views of many of the Himalayan Ranges.

We had the excellent guidance of Asis and our wonderful porter Raju (I highly recommend that you ask for them when getting in touch with this company), we have achieved every goal we set for this trip. Asis organised everything for us and thought of every little detail from antibacterial gel to biscuits for afternoon tea. We have seen many tour guides on the way to Base Camp who would remain behind to chat with their fellow guide hence leave their clients alone in some treacherous paths, Asis would never do that. He adjusts his pace according to the clients and he would never get you out of his sight, in case something happens. Many times when I was struggling to see the next unfrozen point in the path, he would come to the rescue and made sure I would cross that bit safe and sound. I would heavily recommend anyone to specifically ask for him."

            "review": "Recommended tour group for EBC. Having completed a trek to Mt.Kilimanjaro in Feb 2014 my wife and I decided we'd give Everest Base Camp a go. In selecting a tour company we chose Himalayan Glacier based on a colleague's recommendation. We found going through the source rather than a third party who subcontract it to a local operator (as can be the case) both saved us money and gave us a greater understanding of who we were dealing with.After feeling very fortunate in having a great group in Kilimanjaro we decided we wouldn't risk the group dynamic this time and chose to take the tour as a couple. We also took the trip over the Australian summer (Jan 2015) - which is the Nepalise winter - the main benefits of which are the lack of crowds and mainly crystal clear days. We chose the 15-day luxury trek which included a day tour of Kathmandu and approx 11 days of actual trekking. Of this 5 nights were in \"luxury lodges\" hosted by Yeti Mountain Houses and 6 nights were at tea houses/lodges. The differences between the luxury lodges and guest house/tea houses was significant particularly for those who dread communal toilets, especially in the bitter cold. We would definitely choose this form of \"glamping\" again. The Kathmandu day tour was run by a very informative guide ( forget his name) but very knowledgable, good English and plenty of stats. Whilst \"temple-itis\" set in quickly, we found the day surprisingly enjoyable and a great experience of Kathmandu city. The trekking part was run by our guide Pradip and our porter Furman. Pradip was an extremely competent guide, great English skills and knowledge of the various mountains and their peak heights. He was always ready to help and make sure we were ok. Whilst I think we're pretty straight forward and low maintenance, we really couldn't ask for anymore. Our porter likewise always carried our bags with no fuss, forever with a smile and whatever English he knew and always helping out with tea and clearing plates etc.As a team both Pradip and Furman worked very well and are a credit to Himalayan Glacier. In summary the comments we make are: * Compared to Kilimanjaro we found this trek far more enjoyable. All the various villages, proper altitude acclimatisation, and being in the midst of such a landscape was amazing.  * Of the very many tour groups in Nepal, we would recommend Himalayan Glacier to anyone for professionalism and care of Trekkers as well as proper conditions for guides and porters. Personal touches by the owner to make sure things met expectations was also appreciated. * Request Pradip and Furman to be on your group if at all possible. * Whilst trekking in winter was cold towards Base Camp (around minus 10 in the tea/guest houses at night) we preferred having more of the trails and guest houses to ourselves or a few others. Of approx 39,000 who do the trek each year, around 9,000 trek in Oct, which in our view would have made the trails and guest houses/lodges way too busy and hardly enjoyable for such a serene location. However we also note that for most of the trek, when going uphill we spent a lot of time in t-shirts and lose clothing. * The luxury Yeti Lodges were well worth it - not only was the food far better, but hot showers and bathrooms to yourself and electric blankets added a little bit of comfort to what can become a little tiresome in the guest houses.* A lot of the food on the menus arrived quite differently to what you'd expect in a western country. Tolerance of understanding that this was the Nepalise version of a favourite dish goes a long way. * Avoid potatoes or anything that may of needed preserving north of Namche Bazaar. We made the fatal mistake and thereafter stuck with staples that came from a tin or was dried ( eg pasta sauce, soups, noodles, etc ). * Take plenty of layers with you clothing wise. Beware that the 15kg limit on baggage for the Lukla flight includes hand luggage otherwise you have the excess baggage charge ( about $10 for us). * A hot water bottle will get you through cold nights - alternatively having your water bottle filled up with hot water before you go to bed can help. * Last but not least, take plenty of photos and remember that even if the view of Everest is cloudy on the way up, it may still be clear on the way down.

The guides and drivers in Bhutan and Tibet were excellent. Navigating those windy roads definitely takes a level of skill. There had been an issue with the vehicle that was to be used on the Tibet tour several hours before my arrival. This did not affect my time at all. We used taxis and public transport (at no cost to myself) for getting around Lhasa.

We moved thru the deep mountain gorges. Across multiple, high suspension bridges, thru villages and along mountain trails where nothing moves unless someone carries it, from heavy stoves for the tea houses to the 4x4 beams to build houses. The constant sound of rushing, milky colored water, hundreds of feet below us was a constant reminder of the magnitude of the countryside. The mountains appeared and disappeared in the high mist, but are overwhelming when fully revealed. The resonant chanting of the Buddhist monks will remain with me forever as will the lone Yak bells along the trails. Himalayan Glacier is a first class organization from start to finish. The guide, Bimal Thapa was simply outstanding. When I needed special treatment for an injury the entire Himalayan Glacier team made sure everything I required was provided for and personally made sure I was taken care of. I will go again without a doubt. But the besides the incredible scenery the personal care show for me will remain with me always."

And many breathtaking sunrises did I see from the mountain tops. Naba is passionate about Himalayan Glacier Trekking and this is reflected throughout his very loyal team who are more than happy to assist you in having a life changing experience when trekking with them.

Doing such a long trip over nine days required an experienced and efficient tour company and Himalayan Glacier delivered on all counts. Things can go terribly wrong travelling 1000 km at such high altitudes so we wanted a knowledgeable person to plan the itinerary and arrange the logistics of passing from Nepal to China and then back to Nepal without any hassles. We found him in Mr. Naba of HGT. The whole trip was executed like a dream. He took care to arrange for us to acclimatise ourselves properly in Lhasa before setting out for higher terrain. A master visa for all twelve of us made immigration checks a breeze. The Tibetan guide was superb. Fluent in English and thoroughly professional. The driver was very skillful and he needed to be since our vehicle was travelling along winding mountain roads. Sure, some of us still experienced some AMS symptoms but we were prepared with medication and oxygen. And sure the road to EBC was torturous to say the least, but this is an adventure trip as Mr. Naba himself told us in his earlier briefing. So we were prepared to take the bad with the good. And it was good!It was exhilarating taking in the mountains and lakes, experiencing a snowfall and visiting the ancient monasteries. Not your run-of-the-mill type of holiday definitely.

I was taken to the hotel (Shanker) and got settled in after being up for 40 hours! We had a welcome dinner, a tour of Kathmandu, and everything was included! We flew to Lukla and luckily had no flight issues! Our tour included the Gokyo Lakes. I was SO glad I booked this trip vs. just going to EBC and back. Our tour breaks off from the mainstream for several days. We saw so much more, it was cleaner, a lot less crowded... Beautiful! Challenging due to Gokyo Ri and the Cho La Pass, but SO worth it!! Gokyo was my favorite part of the trip. EBC was just a bonus! HGT took care of everything! I only really had to pay for tips, 1 shower, battery charging, wifi, and souvenirs!! Our guides were all great: Suresh, Uttar, and Jungbu. Uttar and Jungbu were younger and played cards with us and were very personable. They called me \"didi\", big sister. Kinda miss it! The porters were also fantastic and worked their butts off! We also had afternoon tea every day complete with \"bickies\" (cookies), and fresh cut apples after every dinner! I would highly recommend HGT. Every detail was taken care of from airport transport, to meals, to rooms,... EVERYTHING! I truly can't recommend them highly enough!

The staff was organized and efficient, the trek was well-planned, our guide was outstanding, and the amenities were excellent. We had a great time, and are hoping to return and use this company for a longer trek in the future. We highly recommend them to anyone contemplating a trip to Nepal."

            "review": "Everest Base Camp Trek. My wife and I planned a rapid Everest Base Camp trek through Himalayan Glaciers over the internet. The company was easy to deal with over email. The guide and driver greeted us at the Kathmandu airport and escorted us to the office where they briefed us on the trip, and gave us the sleeping bag, down jacket, blue HG bag and blue HG tshirt. We then had dinner back at our Shanker Hotel which was had good food. Four star hotel which was acceptable according to our standards. We still purified the water with steri-pen even though it purified bottled water. We always used the steri-pen for the trip and never had any gastrointestinal issues. Our guide was Bimal and he was top notch. He was polite, professional, quiet at times, but strong with his recommendations to keep us safe and healthy. For example, he explained that meat should not be eaten above Namche Bazaar. He would check for any symptoms of altitude sickness and had an emergency first aid kit on hand with medications commonly used to treat altitude sickness including Diamox and Ibuprofen. He was well versed in the culture and mountain environment based on his substantial experience leading trekking tours over the past 10+ years with over 50 trips under his belt. After the trip was over and we were back in Kathmandu, he took my wife and I out to the Thamel streets for shopping. We became friends and exchanged contact information at the end of the trip. He was genuine and sincere, as evidenced by the fact that he was constantly approached by other guides from HG or other companies who wanted to greet him. That speaks volumes of his character that everyone knew him and was friendly to him on the trail. That gave us confidence to trust him with his decision making and recommendation. Our porter was Bikram and he did an excellent job carrying our bags over the mountain terrain. He was always courteous, on time, and delivered our bags before we even reached our destination. On the second to last day with him in Namche Bazaar the four of us played a few rounds of pool together. On the last trekking in Lukla, we took him and the guide out to dinner to say farewell to Bikram. He deserved the recognition after doing an excellent job over the long hard work. The trekking experience was more difficult than we initially imagined primarily due to the altitude related issues such as the cold temperature and 50% oxygen relative to sea level when we were 5500meters above sea level. Fortunately, we acclimatized by gradually ascending, and took a rested in Namche. The itinerary was \u201crapid\u201d in part to the rapid descent. Our legs were sore by the end. I would recommend this trip only for those who are physically fit otherwise it may be difficult to enjoy the beautiful surroundings if you are having problems with leg pain from the moderate to hard trekking."

Recently, my friend and I stumbled out into the almost overwhelming chaos that is Kathmandu excitedly looking forward to a trek into the Himalayas. We were met and cared for by Dol, our guide from Himalayan Glacier. We experienced many adventures, including Holi (a funny holiday where we were pelted with colored powder and water balloons). The trek itself was a feast for the senses. The mountains were absolutely glorious; and the non-stop stairs were challenging, yet rewarding. If I ever go back to Nepal, I would have no hesitation requesting Dol as he was kind and professional. From the welcome dinner to the terrifying in-country transportation, to the fantastic trek, to the basic, yet comfortable tea houses...everything was handled expertly by Himalayan Glacier; and I would highly recommend them. Thank you for an incredible experience!"

We cannot say enough about Himalayan Glacier Trekking and highly recommend this organization to all fellow travelers!From the moment our guide met us at the airport and throughout our stay in Nepal, our experience with HGT was beyond compare. We were impressed by the attention to detail regarding every aspect of our trip: the professional orientation; our accommodations in excellent hotels; our airplane reservations; our knowledgeable and helpful guides who also showed us the less visited side streets as well as the thriving tourist section of Thamel. Though we were travelling alone, we always felt safe and in competent hands.The highlights of our trip included visiting the temples in Durbar Square where we were honored to see the current Kumari goddess; the colorful Monkey Temple; Pashaputinath with its heartrending funeral ghats and the unforgettable Tibetan Buddhist Boudhanath Stupa with its wise Buddha eyes looking down at us while monks and devotees walked around its periphery. We also visited Tibetan carpet weaving studios as well as the famous Rum Doodle Restaurant with signatures and photographs of the world's most renowned mountaineers adorning its walls. These include a photo of Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, prominently displayed, who in 1953 was the first Nepali to climb Mt. Everest (Chomolungma - mother goddess of the earth in Nepali) with Sr. Edmund Hillary.We departed Nepal with deep appreciation for the wonderful people of this beautiful country and especially for our friends at Himalayan Glacier Trekking who made our visit to Nepal both joyous and unforgettable. Without reservation my daughter and I (Chori and Aama) highly recommend Himalayan Glacier Trekking to travelers with an interest in Nepal and its rich culture.Namaste and safe travels!"

Raj and Sunil were both excellent, very supportive and good blokes. Our journey to EBC ended at Dughla at lunchtime on the 25th when the earthquake struck. Although the we were at altitude, cold and a long way from home Raj, Sunil and our wonderful porters looked after us, kept us moving, safe and eventually got us to Lobouche for a very cold and scary night. They safely led us back to Luckla, finding safe accommodation and safe paths on the damaged track. At a time of a devasting national disaster the Outfitters team got us to places in between consistent tremors up to 6.7 ! It was sad, unbelievable, tragic and still immensely beautiful. The people of Nepal are the strongest and kindest. I sincerely thank Outfitters and the team on our trek who looked after us and cared for us when we were in extreme danger. To think of us when we know their families were in very sad situations was incredibly overwhelming. I will be back, I think we have about 8 kilometres to go to finish off from where we got to, my bucket list is not complete and I want to see Nepal and the magnificent Nepalese again, my best regards and sincere thanks to the Outfitters team.

I booked this trip with a friend through scoopon during February.Seems a lot of Australians took advantage of this deal.I'll try and quickly sum up the tour in pros and cons; I covered accommodation through my review of moonlight hotel who were the preferred place to stay by outfitter Nepal. Pros;- much cheaper than most tours under the same umbrella. This is the biggest pro with other competitors asking for 2500 AUD for the same tour.- experience through the tour provided the best chances for reaching base camp.- it's not so overly risk averse that you can do most things at your own pace and also have some real adventure.- with reduced numbers of tourists in the aftermath of the earthquake has made the track much user friendly with no hold ups in areas such as the suspension bridges, which also leaves more abilities in top areas for crowded free photos. This also gives the tourist more ability in negotiating prices when shopping.- our guide Hom was extremely patient and friendly throughout some extraordinary circumstances with clients sometimes acting up outside what would be \"normal\" sensible requests.- the sleeping bag provided was extremely good, warm and clean. I wouldn't take one if your okay with using another sleeping bagCons;- the current fuel crisis is causing difficulties in many areas including restaurants for example now stating \" gas free\" menus.- when arriving at the airport for the fly out to Lukla try and have your bags weighed individually on scales before checking in or have that done when actually checking in. 15 kilos combined hand luggage and checked in bags is the limit per person.Other fellow travellers might not be so rigorous when packing to the 15 kilo limit. We ended up around 20 kilos above the limit with only 7 in our party? So the costs was shared - my friend and I ensured we were below the limit excluding items that would have been nice during the walk. Recommend wearing a few sets of clothes on the plane - heavy jackets carry with you for the flight.Things to bring - just a short list.Diamox - above 2700 metres. Can't believe how many people got altitude sickness and waited until after the symptoms had struck them. Improve your chances - take them as prescribed.Aquatabs (water purification) will save you money. The last place Gorekshep is the only place where you must buy bottled water. They get their water from a muddy glacier puddle where all the livestock drink from.Take a water bladder as it's easier to sip as you walk along.A good wind breaker - imperative. Saved my bacon on the Pumori base camp hike. Minus 10 and then add the wind chill!!!!!Hiking boots aren't really that necessary when I was there. Hybrid shoes would have been far more comfortable. However I had no snow on my hike. An extra pair of lightweight comfortable shoes would have been beneficial for around the tea houses.Additional items;Ask for an additional blanket at tea houses before sleep.Buy a beanie along the trek if you like - I got a super warm one in Namche for around 300 rupees.Take a few batteries for your cameras if you can, as charging gets pretty expensive the further up the hill you go.All meat labelled yak is actually buffalo as yaks are far too valuable to just slaughter. You will find that eating meat becomes more risky to eat the further up the hill you go. This means the longer the meat has been sitting on someone's back the further up you go. Avoid when required ask your guide here.Four people of the original seven from our group made it to base camp. Three were not fully prepared - one person had a cyclists water coat as a wind breaker!!!! I suggested getting something warmer than the \"Cape\" he had.I would recommend this company due to the savings and the fantastic nature of our guide and porters. Not sure what extras you would receive from other more expensive companies."

So sad to see the devastation caused by the earthquake, earlier this year, but inspiring to see the Nepalese people getting on with their lives. The trek was equally well organised and Bim, our guide and the 3 porters, looked after our group of 5 brilliantly. Unfortunately, I wasn't well on the first 4 days of the trek, but Bim paced me and I was able to get to the Annapurna Base Camp, without Bim's knowledge, expertise and encouragement, I probably wouldn't have completed the trek. However, the trek was fantastic, the scenery was stunning and seeing the sun rise over the Base Camp was one of the most inspiring things I ever seen. As a 65 year old, I achieved a lifetime ambition and I'm now contemplating a Everest Base Camp trek, with Outfitter Nepal, next year."

I recently was able to work through Outfitter Nepal's Volunteer Program and couldn't be happier with the results.In October I traveled to Khahare which is located in the Dhading District, a rural area of Nepal that was greatly damaged by the 2015 earthquake. With the assistance of more than a dozen local workmen and Outfitter's guide Hari, I was able to complete \"The Pani Project\" This project included the repairing, replacing, and rebuilding of a water system for the Shree Achane Higher Secondary School in Khahare.It was an amazing experience that would not have been possible without the excellent suggestions, help, encouragement and support from Hari Bahadur and Outfitter Nepal. An extra special thanks to Hari for all of his hard work and for his exceptional local knowledge and expertise.I continue to be inspired by the great people at Outfitter Nepal and thier commitment to rebuild thier nation. I look forward to my next trip to Nepal and working again with Hari and Outfitter Nepal."

BIG SHOUT OUT to Mohan our guide - what a guy - full of knowledge and interest and pride in his country - give him a pay rise Arjun!The EBC trek is difficult and many of us were tired and weary along the way, but Mohan kept our spirits high.

Hi all just returned from katmandu and a 15 day trip trekking to Anna Purna well what can I say from the moment I stepped of the plane I was out of my comfort zone it was chaotic manic and frenzied I was met by a representative of outfitter Nepal and we where soon on our way to our first hotel,,,we pulled up late and it all looked scary hotel was under renovation at the time so there where a few loose ends needed finalising,next day went on a tour of katmandu full day very eye opening tour and marvelled in sights I had never seen before,next day we started our adventure of on a 6hour drive where we would start our trek was never worried at the fuel crisis out there even when seeing thousands of people waiting for a bit of fuel we where assured tourist buses would be OK and we was. Thankfully,the trek well I can say is I'm not a Trekker in any form my training for this was a comfortable stroll round picturesque lakes where I live topping it of with a swim a couple of times a week I was comfortable in belief I would stroll round the whole circuit without discomfort,,,,,arrghhh I was in for a shock it nearly broke me ,lol.i remember the man replying to my email expressing my concerns about my fitness and if I would make the circuit,his reply was if you have a strong heart you will do it ,well I guess I have a strong heart because I got stronger every day,,17stone lump am I and I do consider myself a couch potato or did,,the trip was awesome the views where totally overwhelming the simplicity of local life upon the mountain trails where fantastic and so refreshing the leg work was calf busting but rewarding as every turn and uphill hike meant full on wild life from mountain goats in there hundreds troops of monkeys eagles etc,,the mountain tops where in sight and we was eager to get there I won't spoil it for you when u get to see the sun rise at Anna Purna base camp you will know ,,even at 6am from then all down hill very hard to turn my back on the views that I struggled to climb to see but you do and before you no it you are winding your way down trails and meandering to the bottom where you are picked up and drove back to a hotel where being deprived of luxury for a few days meant hot water and a comfy bed was 6star ,the Sherpas where immense so young so strong carrying two large bags of our gear each full credit to them the guide made you feel in good hands and overall the company outfitter Nepal did a great job even taking us out to dinner on the final night to say thank you and to get some feed back,if you're wondering about is it safe to go I would say yes deffo the city was in a bit of chaos but the mountains where so calm and tranquil,,again I'm not a big walker and I was hovering over the buy button for ages when first paying for this trip and all I can say is I'm so glad I had the nerve to push buy ,,it was eye opening culture vulture back breaking awesome and I take my hat of to this company efficient reliable and under the recent tragic circumstances which has befallen this country I'd say first class outfitter Nepal I'd go again and I'd tell all to go to hope people return in there numbers once again ,,,,ow hello to my group that trekked good meeting you ,Noel Barrington ,England"

This was a varied package of sightseeing in Kathmandu, trekking and wildlife in Chitwan NP. From the outset, our enquiries were dealt with quickly and efficiently by Arjun, who arranged the holiday for us, including a number of extras.We were met at the airport and from then onwards, the holiday and all its arrangements ran very smoothly. All the accommodation was of a good standard and the transport, whether by private car, taxi or bus, went well. Our contact \"on the ground\" was Raj, who was available for support throughout and who readily changed our last day so that we could visit a temple that we'd missed earlier.The undoubted highlight was our trek to Ghorepani and Poon Hill. Although this might be deemed easy by Nepalese standards, we found the walking to be satisfying and sometimes challenging. The countryside is extremely beautiful and varied, with farmland, villages and views of the mountains, particularly the walk up to Poon Hill to see the sunrise on a clear morning Special mention goes to our companions, guide Sanjay and porter Rajan. They looked after us well and were excellent throughout, we can't thank them enough. They are both true gentlemen and a credit to the company.For anyone thinking about visiting Nepal after the earthquake, you definitely should. There has been some damage, but all the tourist sites are up and running and there is plenty to see. It's a beautiful place and the people are lovely.We had a brilliant holiday in Nepal. Many thanks to Outfitter Nepal who are an excellent, professional company with great staff. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone."

I travelled with Outfitters for the Everest Base Camp trek (the first one since the Earthquake) at the end of August and I have to say they were so good! Originally our trek was due to leave after the first earthquake and after much panic on my side about re-scheduling my trek, Outfitters were quick to respond to my millions of emails and handled the whole situation with true profession. Our tour was re-scheduled within days. I was blown away.Our Base camp trek guides Suraj and Dipak were great group leaders and their knowledge and experience of the trail felt second to none! They were very friendly and happily answered any questions or concerns I had in great detail. I felt very safe in their hands! My friend and I also had planned to visit other areas of Nepal for which Arjun at Outfitters organised for us at no extra hassle. He had a full week and a half of itinerary planned for us to visit Pohkara and Chitwan N.P which went to plan without a hitch. I have to say our experience of visiting Nepal wouldn't of been as incredible as it was, if it wasn't for Outfitters.. So thank you!"

            "review": "Professional and responsible tour company . My friend and I booked the 12 days EBC trekking package from Outfitter Nepal via Groupon. This was our 2nd time to Nepal. We were very excited and thrilled of the altitude. Nevertheless, on the 7th day of our trek, the devastating Nepal Earthquake happened. We are really blessed and protected by God throughout the next 6 days, and I think one of the biggest reason is because we have good support of mountain guide Raj, assistant mountain guide Sunil and porters who had worked their very best to ensure our remaining trek as safe as possible. (1) Comfort On the days before the earthquake, the teahouse that we stayed are reasonably comfortable (we have make mental preparation that we are coming for trekking tour, not luxury tour). Some even with hot shower! On the days after the earthquake, the team really worked their best to get us safe, undamaged teahouse to stay. I was really blessed that none of the day I need to stay in a tent or dining hall. Many do not have places to stay, or have to sleep in dining hall / corridor. I'm thankful to our porters. Everyday they RUN (imagine to run downhill with aftershocks and landslide happened, not to forget at least 20+kg loaded on their back!) to the next village in order to secure room booking for us. During that period of time, phone network was down and it's impossible to made phone booking with the teahouse. They are like superhero.(2) Safety We have 1 head guide and 1 assistance guide for a group of 11 people. Usually the assistance guide will lead the group with the head guide as the last. Every night our head guide Raj will provide a briefing on the next day trek details after dinner. He is full of experience on the trek and can spell out the details of the trek to the team. Personally I find the briefing is really useful for mental preparation. Yeap, I didn't read the itinerary. On the day the earthquake happened, when all network was down, we rely on word of mouth and were clueless on the severity of the earthquake. Our head guide made the decision of descend base on info on hand. The decision was made for safety reason. We had met another group that delay the decision of descend and the whole group end up have to stay put in dining hall at the last pit stop - Lukla. (3) Fun We have fun and exciting moments throughout the trek. Even though after the crisis happen, with worries on our mind, we still try to have some fun (in a subdue way). Our mountain guide and assistance guide, though worried of their friends and families in Kathmandu and their village, has been very supportive to us. It was a sad moment, and I think only by understanding and respect each other can the whole team pull it through the crisis. The Outfitter team works far more than what I had mentioned above. I'm safely back home without any severe health / injury issue. I always have access to food, clean water and lodging during the days of crisis. Despite I do not have money to pay for flight from Biratnaga to Kathmandu (during crisis there were no small aircraft being able to land in Kathmandu Airport ), the company had prepaid for my flight to get back to Kathmandu. They are sincere people. They did their best to keep us safe though they have bigger worries and urgency for their home and family. Words couldn't express how much I appreciate what the Outfitter team has done. The beauty of Nepal and Nepalese will always remain in my heart."

From the moment I had emailed Outfitter Nepal to schedule my trek a year ago and till the day I left for my flight they have been right there through it all. Email correspondence was fast and easy. Outfitter Nepal was very informative and helpful. Before we went on our trek we had a nice city tour and had briefings to discuss what would happen throughout the trek. Namaraj who goes by ANDY took care of everything in Kathmandu. Our trip was led by Raj (main guide) and Sumil (assistant guide). We had a great group and enjoyed ourselves during the trek. Both Raj and Sumil were very accommodating, entertaining, helpful, and fun. Unfortunately, halfway through my trek I became very sick. It was not from AMS, I had eaten something and was having intense abdominal pain that I had to be helicoptered back to Kathmandu. Raj and Andy both took care of my insurance company and figured things out for me to arrive safely in KTM. Upon arrival I did not expect anyone from Outfitter Nepal to come visit me at the hospital. Andy showed up to check on me and to see if I needed anything. He told me he would come the next day to pick me up and take care of things. I was very thankful that I had someone there to help as I was not feeling well at all. The only people that were helping me was my boyfriend and sister who were across the world from me and they could not do anything for me in Nepal. I was alone if Andy was not there for me.Andy took care of everything till the end. He took me to the hotel the next day, made all the arrangements for the airport and even got me some gatorade! Maybe the Gatorade sounds silly but honestly it was a life saver. I came home and was hospitalized and found that I had a parasite. I am finally recovering and much better. The night I left Kathmandu... 8 hours later is when the earthquake took place. I am not sure if my illness was a blessing or a curse but I was very lucky to have left the time I did. My friend who was still on the trek was a day away from Everest Base Camp when the earthquake had struck. Fortunately, the group was not affected and because of the care of Outfitter Nepal my best friend just made it home on Sunday safely. Even in this catastrophe Outfitter Nepal stood strong and stood by their customers and for that I truly respect them. They are all so genuine and I could not ask for more. I would recommend them over and over again. They truly care and are the best of the best! Martha Ha"

Prior to the trek I was dealing directly with Arjun via email who was prompt with his responses and extremely helpful. On arrival to the meeting point at hotel Moonlight (good hotel) the group was met by Raj who gave us a detailed brief on what to expect during the trek and again answered any questions the group had. When we arrived at Lukla airport the group was met by Birodh the guide and his support staff (assistant guides/porters). The whole transition was seamless. I was very impressed by the coordination.Birodh was outstanding as the lead guide. He was very motivating, knowledgeable and observant to the needs of the group. While he was jovial throughout the trek, he was able to make the tough decisions when required (evacuating people back to Lukla) and constantly adjust to the appropriate course of action to keep the trek moving forward.I would strongly recommend Outfitter for any trek you intend to do. I had an outstanding experience and would not hesitate to trek with them when I get the chance to do the Annapurna circuit.For the trek be aware:- Although it suggests you should be able to walk 4-6h. Most days were longer than this and there are some very steep slopes both up and down, coupled with the high altitude. You need to have at least a basic level of fitness, but this doesn\u2019t mean age restrictions apply (except being too young).- Drink 4-5L water a day without fail (or whatever ensures urine is mostly clear each time). This will get you out of bed multiple times during the night but it is necessary.- People do get evacuated by helicopter more regularly than you\u2019d think due to Acute Mountain Sickness symptoms. Don\u2019t be afraid of this; just be aware as it is easily managed by managing yourself \u201cEat on time, drink on time and sleep on time\u201d.The team/guides will discuss everything else in detail for you to be aware of. Listen to their advice."

None of the 5 of us had done anything like this before, and their advice made our lives so much easier. Once we reached Kathmandu there was a taxi waiting for us, straight to our hotel, our down jackets and bags arrived asap.Everything we needed to make our EBC adventure as good as possible was there for us.Our amazing guide Amrit (Legend) B was waiting at Lukla airport for us. His personality was infectious, he guided us to the most majestic views this planet has to offer. Our porters were also led by Dez, who was like an assistant guide all the way through our TREK. Arjun the man who replied to our E-mail questions from March 2014 onwards was great and fantastic to meet him. Raj also looked after us in a very courteous/professional manner while in Kathmandu.The 5 of us were lucky enough to conquer Everest Base Camp, a bucket list item for most people on this planet. We were even luckier that we dealt with Arjun, Raj, Amrit and Des, who were part of an amazing company called Outfitter Nepal, without them the majestic sites we were able to embrace would have been nothing but a dream. Thank you so much Outfitter Nepal for everything, from E-mails to down jackets to that smile first thing in the morning. Keep up the great work guys, and keep on making peoples dreams into a beautiful majestic reality:)"

Everything, from start to finish was awesome. My sister and I were picked from the airport and taken to a good hotel in the heart of the tourist area of Kathmandu, a great location. The next day we had a city tour of Kathmandu, Our guide was lovely, spoke good English and gave us lots if valuable information. We were able to take our time at each of the places we visited and were never rushed to get to the next place. She also gave us a great insight into everyday life of Nepalese people - marriage, health care, education, death etc Next the journey to Chiwan National Park with white water rafting on the way. How exciting and a great way to break up the long journey through stunningly beautiful countryside. The guide at Chitwan was very difficult to understand at first but after a while we did become accustomed to his English. He was very knowledgable of the local area, traditions and especially the wildlife. We floated down the croc infested river in a dugout canoe to the jungle in order to spot rhino, wild boar, deer and other wild animals. He showed signs of where tigers had been, where rhinos had mud bathed and scratched against the trees then we saw a rhino! Later that day we went on an elephant safari through the jungle spotting many more animals - elephants don't need tracks or paths! Lastly, we went to Pokhara in the mountains. Again, a hotel in a great location and a great guide for the city tour. Our driver was very quiet and did not speak much english but he was very considerate and a really safe driver. I can't say enough good things about this company, they would do anything to help make your tour the best experience they possibly could."

Outfitter accommodated all my questions and replied promptly. Everest BC trek was mixed with adventure and unplanned struggles to which our guide and porters assisted. We did it !!!!! and after time passes I realised the extreme efforts by the team to get us there and back safely. Secondly another trek to Annapurna BC was spectacular and and different scenery to EBC... again the guide and porters kept us safe and a priority when the mountains challenged us. I'm going back again and Outfitter will be my first choice. Thankyou Outfitter for a lifetime of wonderful memories. Highly recommended!!!"

My partner and I had booked a trekking tour through Outfitter Nepal which was supposed to start on a certain date, however when we were due to arrive in Kathmandu, there had been a minor place crash in Kathmandu airport which closed it for 4 days.We were worried that we weren't able to make the trip or that our trip would be cut short, but we were ensured that our trip would remain the same when we arrive. Since we were stuck in transit for 4 days we had very limited access to communication, which made us quite worried as emails weren't replied as quick as we'd hoped.We arrived at the airport at 12 at night to which it took us 2 hours to get our luggage. As we had no real means to communicate that we had arrived, we were worried that we'd have to find our own transport and accommodation for the night. Luckily we found our guide in amongst the crowd outside still waiting for us and were taking to our hotel for the night.From then on it was all smooth sailing, the tour guide was great, informative and was helpful when needed.I'd be happy to recommend Outfitter Nepal to anyone planning to do some trekking."

There is comfort in knowing that Outfitters Nepal are there for travellers to Nepal because it takes the worry out of having to organise trips, porters, guides etc as they do it all. I would give Outfitter Nepal a 5 star rating and would not consider travelling with anyone else when I return to Nepal."

From the first email to Arjun, requesting details of possible trips, to our final drop off at the airport at 5am everything went as smooth as clockwork. Our inward flight was delayed by 6 hours due to fog at Kathmandu Airport. We had further delays due to the large numbers queuing for visas. Despite these long delays as soon as we emerged from the airport we spotted our pick up. We have no idea how long he had to wait around for us, but he was a most welcome sight! This attention to detail was replicated in all our experiences on the tour.Our guide, Birodh, and his two assistants did everything to make our trek as enjoyable as possible. Our accommodation, meals, the pace of the trek, etc. - all excellent. As we had a spare day at the end of our trek Raj organised a tour to Bhaktapur and Patan. Again, a very enjoyable experience with a lovely guide.For anyone considering a trip to Nepal, no matter what their particular needs are, we would without hesitation recommend Outfitter Nepal as the best of tour/trekking companies."

Booking from the UK was straightforward and we really appreciated the quick responses to questions etc... Even when we had to change our flight time last minute, they were flexible in our pick up. Our whole trek in Nepal was seamlessly organised by Outfitter Nepal, we never had to worry about how we would get places or what we needed to do. Much of this is down to the excellent guides they employ. Our guide was very personable and caring and along with our porter made our trip even more enjoyable and exciting with good natured jokes and informative explanations of the local people and mountains which is priceless when you have long days of walking and sometimes need a little encouragement. We really enjoyed the trek that Outfitter Nepal put together for us up to Annapurna Base Camp and want to thank Raj and his team for such an amazing time and our guide Mohan for his outstanding leadership and company. I think what makes Outfitter Nepal an excellent choice over the many rivals out there is the individual service you receive, you are more than just another client, they know who you are, what you want to do and are keen to tailor to your needs. The fact that the co-owner Raj spent some time"

My new husband and I booked a special package tour with Outfitter Nepal for our honeymoon and from the absolute beginning of our emails with Arjun (one of the company directors) to their organizing a car to drive us back to the airport, we have had a fantastic experience. Because we got this tour through a special deal provider, we didn't know what to expect and thought it might be a cheap abridged version of Nepal's sightseeing potential. But instead, we had an amazing itinerary full of cultural and historical sightseeing, then a challenging and very rewarding 5 day trek to Poon Hill, a relaxing 2 day jungle safari, and a lovely farewell dinner with Raj (company manager). The itinerary was set out well: something low key, then a challenging trekking adventure, and then the opportunity to wind down again. The guides and porters from Outfitter Nepal were excellent: friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable and helpful. Within a day, our group (we had a perfect group size of 10) and the guides/porters were getting along like family. My husband and I had arrived a day earlier than the tour was officially starting, and Raj had given us the option to go on an additional day tour to visit Bhaktapur and Patan which was great. All our accommodation and food had been organised prior to our arrival; all our transitions between lodges and hotels were smooth and we didn't experience any problems or disruptions to our holiday at all.Perhaps in the near future, Outfitter Nepal could add a small amount into the fees ($10 per person maybe?) to go towards helping porters purchase good trekking gear for themselves like footwear, clothing, rain gear etc. The porters are so hard working and wonderful, I personally would love to see them getting treated well. As mentioned, the porters we had with Outfitter Nepal were fantastic. The trek level of difficulty was rated as 'easy' but for a Westerner of average fitness, I'd probably rate it more as 'medium'. Perhaps Outfitter Nepal could include a basic fitness guide to help tourists gauge if they can successfully complete the trek (example: how often do you exercise a week? Are you able to walk 5km a day with minimal difficulty? Etc). That being said, our trekking guide Santos was extremely patient and accommodating and reiterated that the trek was not a race and for everyone to go at their natural pace and listen to their bodies. We are sad to leave this beautiful country and it's even more beautiful people, but are looking forward to coming back and traveling with Outfitter Nepal again. Thank you for your hospitality! We will never forget this trip!"

My brother and I book Nepal tour with Everest Base Camp trek with Outfitter Nepal and after numerous informative replies from Arjun (of Outfitter Nepal), we booked ourselves to join the Everest Base Camp trek\\tour in early May 2014. Alongside 2 other fellow trekkers, we were introduced to our friendly guide Vim and the latter's intimate knowledge of the paths, conditions, etc made our experience an unforgettable one. All domestic flights, teahouse bookings, porters, etc were organized flawlessly. As it so happens, my brother and I were affected by AMS and had to stay in Namche for some time as a precaution. Our guide Vim was prompt to make sure that we would be looked after by the teahouse owners and organised for one porter to stay behind just in case we felt better and wanted to keep trekking. While Vim pushed on with the other 2 trekkers and another porter, he regularly kept in touch with the Namche teahouse owners to see how we were going + also advised us of the upcoming plans (ie, day that he would be back). So, while my brother and I didn't make it to EBC (through no fault from Outfitter Nepal), we felt safe in the knowledge that we were looked after at all times and were able to relax\\recuperate. While on the tracks, Vim was excellent at gauging and adapting to our various levels of fitness and desire to take pictures of the fantastic surroundings. Overall, It was such a great experience that I know that my brother and one of the other trekkers are already planning another trek with Outfitter Nepal next year. As for me, I will definitely go with them again in a few years' time with my son (when he is older) and would gladly recommend Outfitter Nepal to my friends as an excellent trekking company to go with in Nepal."

Outfitter stood out because of the speed of reply and focus on what I was hoping for out of a city tour. I am so glad I went with this tour company and many thanks to Arjun for answering so many questions in advance of arrival!I may have been the only person in Kathmandu not on a trek, but appreciated that guide Bikash understood my interest in learning about the city, culture, and temples. We had a nice balance of history, fun facts, and a little shopping. As a single female traveling alone, I felt very safe the whole time and Bikash did a great job of keeping an eye on how I was feeling in the heat. I believe the sign of a good guide is when they feel less like an escort and more like a highly knowledgeable friend. Bikash certainly achieved this!I would recommend Outfitter Nepal for their services - they were great about all coordination, quick replies, and an amazing experience during my few short days in Kathmandu. Thanks again!(Side note - Make sure you have two passport size photos with you upon entering Kathmandu. You can take your picture at the airport for a price and a little delay. Also there are two entry forms to complete. Many people missed this!)"

Everything was seamlessly planned and organized through Outfitter Nepal. They were very helpful in answering all of our questions, providing gear as needed and even helping to change our travel plans when we decided to fly back to Pokhara. The company is very trustworthy and you get exactly what you pay for. Our guide, Santosh, was excellent and very accommodating in helping us to feel as comfortable as possible. Our porters were great in helping us to get our belongings to each location and taking care of our things when it rained. I highly recommend this company if you are looking to trek in Nepal and we will certainly use them again when we return."

Both trips were strenuous, but the friendly and helpful team of guides and porters made them both unforgettable experiences. What is most remarkable though is that the trips were undertaken with young children (Aged 8 and 11 in 2011). They loved spending time with the team, learned to play the drums, ploughed fields with an oxen drawn plough and sang songs around a campfire in the evenings. Priceless memories for them and us. Outfitter Nepal were instrumental in the success of the trips both in the organisation from Kathmandu and the quality of their leadership in the mountains. I would recommend Outfitter Nepal to anyone considering any excursion in Nepal, particularly trips into the big mountains. I am certain that as a family we will return to Nepal and of course will again rely on Outfitter Nepal."

Our guide Harry Pokhrel from\u00a0Great Vision Treks and Expeditions was\u00a0top class. His English was excellent, his care for our welfare during a sometimes gruelling experience was\u00a0second-to-none and he was great company too! Our porter (soon to be guide) Krishna Khanal was\u00a0strong (machine-like stength) and had great humour, rounding out a stellar team!\u00a0The Manaslu circuit is a highly cultural and challenging experience. The mountain when you see it, is easily the most spectacular we saw in the entire trek. Though we originally planned to trek the Tsum valley, the state of the trail leading to it was unsafe. One complaint of ours is that Great Vision failed to inform us of this until we were basically starting the Tsum valley! To be fair to them, they had a plan B and we changed our itinerary on the spot to include the Annapurna circuit. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise, insofar as the Annapurna trek was awesome. Ask your trekking company about the state of your chosen trek, be aware they don't like to disappoint you so perhaps reassure them that any news is good news where safety is concerned.Shankar, the manager of Great Vision, kindly picked us up from\u00a0the airport, welcomed us warmly to Nepal and was generally very friendly. Our only complaints about his service was occasional lack of clear information. I would recommend potential customers to challenge him on everything to do with transport to and from the trek and transport of your bags if you are ending up in Pokhara afterwards.Harry our guide is local to the Manaslu region, actively seeks local knowledge regarding state of the trails and landslide prone areas. He ensures food is hygienically prepared and trust him on his choice of accommodation. Generally his choice is best and he is alert to Western comforts. He is also great buzz and taught us many things about the local flora and fauna (including eating foraged food) as well as many evenings playing Nepali card games together. He is a kind-hearted and honest man who we instantly warmed to. He even invited us to dinner with his lovely wife Sangita when we returned to Kathmandu (she is an amazing cook!).Our porter (again, soon to be guide) Krishna was also awesome company and such a funny dude. Same as Harry, he is local to the Manaslu area and is actually Harry's cousin!Overall, our experience, aided by Great Vision, was mind-blowing. If we had to choose one trek over the other, our choice would be Manaslu. It is more challenging (no wifi and basic accommodation) but also much more rewarding than the Annapurna circuit. The Annapurna circuit was well marked and provisioned and the views are simply glorious. It is obviously to the customer's taste which\u00a0trek they decide to do. But we cannot recommend Harry or Krishna enough.Cost for two people, a guide and porter,\u00a0all necessary permits and accommodation paid for (we paid for food and considered it a saving over paying upfront) was 1650 USD. We considered this a fair price. However I would mention that if we were to do it again, we would also pay for accommodation ourselves, despite having to carry more cash.Some essentials :Take chlorine solution for water. No need to buy any just fill up from local taps in the mountains. Your guide will help you choose faucets or tals that are safest. We also had a lifestraw and a steripen.Bring snacks with you if you can. Buying on the trail is costly.\u00a0Be careful on the Manaslu trek there are some areas which can turn dangerous in a hurry. Ask your guide questions about the state of the trail and how safe sections are as you encounter them.\u00a0In Lho, a small village in the Nubri valley, visit the small monastery in the town. The monks and especially their Tibetan cooks are so welcoming and looked after us with a fire and plentiful tea. Lovely experience.At Sama, if the weather is clear enough, attempt Manaslu base camp on your rest day. It is gruelling but at the top the feeling is incredible. You also gain some valuable acclimatisation and sleep well that night!"

Shankar met us at the airport and helped us plan an awesome trek in the Upper Mustang region. We were assigned Ragesh (we called him Razz) who really took care of us on the trek. Our plane from Pokhara to Jomson was cancelled and Shankar organised a jeep for us all the way from Kathmandu so we wouldn't miss out on our trekking days. When we changed our plans for the end of our trek (choosing to spend some time in Chitwan instead of heading back to Pokhara) Shankar ensured that we had a ride to Chitwan and organised a driver to get us back to Kathmandu. While we were walking Shankar also organised our India visas and bus trips for the next part of our journey out of Nepal!Overall, Great Vision are an warm and friendly company. Almost everyone who works in the company is family to Shankar, and GV really go out of their way to help you. From booking stuff to telling you the fair price to pay for souvenirs and services. Our guide had a backpack full of medical supplies and additional clothing in case it got cold and ended up helping other trekkers along the way who had less prepared guides.

We had Harry as our guide for the trip and I must say, we've are immensely glad that we did! I had a couple of days in Kathmandu before setting of, and got excellent help for taking day trips, planning the trek and finding a better hotel than the one I was booked at for the first days. And once we were on the trek with Harry being our guide, the experience got even better. Harry is definitely a guide I would recommend. He is easy talking to, fun to be around and really knows his way around. There was never a time when we - or others around - did not feel taken care of or left with unanswered questions.I could probably write pages and more pages from the trip and my experience hiring Great Vision Trek, but I'd rather recommend you take the trip yourself. And if you do, these guys are without a doubt those who will get you there! Only regret I have is not travelling longer!Regards Christian Kj\u00e6r, Denmark."

Harry is a very helpful guide and he takes good care of me throughout the trek. He is also a positive, energetic and handsome gentleman, who gives me lots of encouragement during the trekking. I am very satisfied with the company helping to arrange everything on the 13-day trek plus my accommodation in Kathmandu and Pokhara. I will definitely trek with Great Vision and Harry again in the future."

I arrived in Kathmandu with no prior arrangements and expected to burn a couple of precious days in making arrangements to acquire a guide and to fly to Lukla to begin a trek to Everest Base Camp. Instead, the travel desk at the airport took my information about the type of accommodations and travel interests and then pointed me to a smiling young man... Shankar. He quickly came over to the desk, listened to the info and assured me that he could make the arrangements and have me booked to Lukla quickly with a guide and mountain accommodations. He was very friendly. He and his driver ferried me and another airline passenger for no charge to the hotel wherein his office was prominently located. (Note: This worked well in Nepal but, when in South America, never get in a vehicle that is not marked as a taxi). Shankar handled every detail from that first day until I got in the plane for the flight back home. He did so for a very reasonable fee. Shankar, the tour operator and a former guide, described the itinerary and possible flight delays due to the start of the \"rainy season.\" I flew out the next morning and was met at Lukla by a wonderful young Sherpa, Gyelgan. He spoke good English in several dialects. Gyeljan took good care of me. He quickly ascertained my conditioning level and monitored my health status regularly and adjusted our hiking speed and itinerary as reasonable and necessary. Overnights and dayly meals in the various \"tea houses\" made travel easy. I had a great time interacting with local people. Gyelgan seems to know everyone. There is no need for a tent or a sleeping bag. The rain did delay our flight back to Kathmandu but Gyelgan and Shankar modified flight tickets and coordinated with pilots as necessary to get me a flight. No worries for me. Overall, it was a great trip with wonderful friendly people. Oh! The views and scenery are spectacular - as expected.JesseRetired firefighter USA"

Normally I get very annoyed at these sort of things, but I honestly liked him instantly. He offered us an excellent deal on the Annapurna Circuit trek and we left after one day. Our guide, Ganesh Khanal, was SOOOO knowledgeable of the region. He was super fun to talk too, his english was outstanding, and he was an amazing hiker. (He NEVER got tired!). He could answer all our questions about each region we hiked through and he always walked at our pace. Our two porters, SooZan and Subash were so great at their jobs. They were always smiling and laughing, and they were very encouraging of us as well. If you plan to go to Nepal to do any hiking, I highly recommend requesting Ganesh as your guide, and go with Great Vision. There are many many trekking organizations in Kathmandu, but seriously- go with these guys."

He planned for me a trip to Chitwan and a trek, including all of the transportation to/from Kathmandu. He was really informative, explaining what each part of my trip entailed, and he brokedown the prices for me as well. I actually had a wound on my leg that was healing slowly, and he was very flexible with me, letting me know that if my leg didn't heal after my Chitwan trip that I could get my money refunded for the Annapurna trek (and told me how much that would be). That was such a relief. I found him to be very friendly and engaging, and I think that all the people for the company appreciate working there because of the atmosphere - something that is rare to find sometimes. I LOVED everything about the Chitwan trip that they put together, including the hotel and the guide that I had while there. I ended up being able to do the trek, and I think I got the best trekking guide in Nepal, Harry:) He actually works for Great Vision and does different treks for them. I felt like I was hiking with a friend from home. Except Harry would bring me masala tea every time I was cold:)!! He was very sensitive to my needs and actually ended up changing what we did on the last day of the trek on the fly b/c my shoes weren't handling the snow/ice on the trail we were to take. SO awesome. The places we stayed at during the trek were so much fun. I really had a blast in Nepal.

Despite the fuel crisis Great Vision was able to organise the necessary transports. I was welcomed very warmly by all employees of the agency and everyone was happy to answer my questions. Ganesh guided me on the Circuit and altough he is still young he made everything possible to allow me a great experience. The schedule was very flexible and I could decide which distances we covered on each day. Thanks again for everything!"

They gave us a really good price and were very helpful befor, during and after the trek.Befor the trek we were invited and warmly welcomed by their family to celebrate \"Dasain\", which was a nice cultural experience. Our guide Prakash Simkhada knew the trek very well. He is a great guide and very good in playing cards (what we did a lot) ;-).Although it must have been hard to organise the trek after the earthquake and in the middle of the fuel crisis, everything worked out perfectly and I can highly recommend them."

From mid october to end october we did the Manaslu Circuit with Great Vision Trek & Expedition. They providied us with a very good package price exactly to our wishes. (all costs of Guide, Transport, permits and accomodation included, costs for food excluded) Moreover the trip schedule was very flexible. The Guide, Prakash Simkhada, Great Vision provided was very experienced and did the trek several times. Also we became really good friends on the trek and had an amazing time. Another group of Great Vision who started at the same time with an other Guide got some troubles due to the bad weather (it was snowing for two days) and altitude sickness in Samdo. Great Vision managed their fly out with the Helicopter as well as they managed everything with the insurance to pay. Our group could safely pass Larke pass and from Dharapani we took a Jeep. I guess managing all the transport at this time (for weeks there was a big shortage of petrol and gas due to the blocked border to India) was not very easy, but it worked out perfectly. I can absolutely recommend Great Vision Treks and Expeditions they were able to provide a perfect, safe and amazing Manaslu Trek under not easy circumstances. Moreover we became really good friends to the lovely family runned company. Next Time in Nepal I will go Trekking with them again."

Kedar took the time to get to know us our interest and our budget. He recommended activities based on our interest and within our budget. He booked everything and always had someone meet us and take care of us both in Kathmandu and Pokhara. He uses knowledgeable guides who have a high level of fluency in the English language. He handled every detail with precision for sight seeing in the mountains, touring historic temples, booking airfare to and from Pokhara, drivers in Pokhar and Kathmandu, hotels in Pokhara and Kathmandu and even paragliding. He even drove me to the airport for my return flight to Texas at no charge and that was a ticket I booked before meeting him. He saw me off with a Nepalese good luck token. I couldn't be happier with my experience with Great Vision Treks & expedition and with Kedar. Despite the news coverage of the earthquake earlier this year, Nepal is a beautiful country and is open for tourist! I plan to return to Nepal in the future and I will let Great Visions handle all the details of the trip for me."

Kedar (Managing Director) took to us like family in Nepal and provided us with an exceptional guide in Ram for our first two days in Kathmandu. We were able to see everything we wanted to in the city and he was very knowledgeable about the city and all of the symbolism and history throughout the city. After two days, Kedar decided he would personally take us to the countryside to make us feel like true Nepali. Unfortunately, there was a landslide on the road we were attempting to take, but he provided us with several alternative activities we could do. We ended up choosing to see more of Kathmandu and once again it was wonderful. Kedar could not have been kinder or friendlier to us and we have never been happier with a decision for a guiding agency. Kedar took a very hands on approach with us and always made sure we saw what we wanted and that we were enjoying our time in his wonderful country, even when he was not the one leading us around the city. Without a guide Kathmandu would likely be one of the most difficult cities to navigate around, but thankfully we had wonderful service and guides and our family cannot wait to return to Nepal!"

I\u2019ve just returned from the Ultimate Tour of Nepal and want to make sure you know how to have the best Nepal tour possible. First, you want to make sure you choose a competent and experienced travel partner in Nepal that meets your requirements. We were lucky to find this in Makalu Adventures. By way of reference this trip was the annual \u2018adventure trip\u2019 that my brother and I (\u201cBrothers Rice\u201d) have taken for the last ~8 years. Over the years we have used all types of travel guides, group tours, private guides, day tours, etc. in over a dozen European, Asian, African, and South American countries. We have used both small local companies as well as large tour operators like Gap Tours (G Adventures) and Intrepid Travel. Our accommodations have ranged from basic bush camping to 5-star hotels and everything in between. Our budget is typically low to moderate so I believe I\u2019m well qualified to provide you with an honest and insightful review of Makalu Adventures for your consideration.Here is what we loved about Makalu Adventures:\u2022 Vast experience \u2013 they offer everything from city tours to mountain climbing.\u2022 Reviews \u2013 there is a reason people rave about Makalu. They do a great job.\u2022 Personable \u2013 The company is now large but still personable.\u2022 Charitable \u2013 The owner (Mohan) has rebuilt 3 schools already.\u2022 Flexible \u2013 Unlike large group tours Makalu will tailor your experience.\u2022 Affordable \u2013 Very affordable compared to other companies.\u2022 Unique \u2013 Makalu Adventures will give you a unique experience in Nepal.We spent two weeks touring Nepal with Makalu and got to see and do some amazing things including: trekking, meeting holy men, visiting the Ghats, temple tours, village tours, private tours, authentic dinners, jungle safari, white water rafting, and more. We really learned a ton about Nepal thanks to our guide Serius. There was simply no question about Nepal that he could not answer and we asked him about everything. With our city guide (Tulsi) we were able to learn a lot about Kathmandu and meet the living Goddess of Nepal.It\u2019s important to mention that at one point our tour had some issues and Mohan addressed and resolved these immediately. To me, the mark of a great company is not perfection (there is no such thing) but instead the ability to recover from snafus and delight the customer - and that\u2019s what we experienced with Makalu Adventures.Makalu also arranged for us to visit a village devastated by the earthquake and we donated school supplies to the children of a school that Makalu is rebuilding. This was an experience that was as rewarding for us as it was or them. In summary, the beauty of Nepal and welcoming nature of its people enchanted us.Namaste,-JayPS: some tips below to ensure you also have a great time in Nepal.Nepal travel tips:\u2022 Pack light \u2013 Especially if you are trekking or moving around a lot you don\u2019t want too much stuff to haul around. A backpack or small suitcase that fits inside a duffel bag is highly recommended. \u2022 Bring Duffel Bag - The duffel bag was a Huge benefit for our trip. It can be used to check the backpack or suitcase so it won\u2019t get wrecked. Plus, you can leave behind items at a hotel while you trek to lighten your load. And, you can pack souvenirs inside the duffel for your return trip.\u2022 Skimp on clothes \u2013 rookie mistake is packing too many clothes. Instead, plan to wear clothes more than once. Plan to wash clothes in Nepal (you can do this very inexpensively). Also, consider packing a small vial of laundry solution to wash clothes in the tub and air dry.\u2022 Bring Imodium \u2013 food adjustment will happen.\u2022 Understand Accommodations \u2013 Nepal is a developing country and most hotels are basic. A 4-star hotel may only be 1-2 stars in Europe or U.S.\u2022 Know Travel Durations \u2013 Important you know how long it may take on a bus, train, car, etc. before your next stop so you can still hydrate without worrying about an emergency \u2018code yellow\u2019 or \u2018code brown\u2019. \u2022 Get Power Adapter \u2013 Nepal is a wide 2-prong style plug unlike U.S.\u2022 Avoid Public Transport \u2013 I advise you avoid public transportation (buses especially) as they are overcrowded and drive erratically. A good company like Makalu will provide an experienced driver with solid transport in A/C.\u2022 Specify your needs \u2013 If you require a fluent English-speaking guide \u2013 specify it. If you require a highly knowledgeable guide on culture, location etc. vs. simply someone to go from A-B, then specify it. Etc.Trekking Tips:\u2022 Buy Some Gear in Nepal \u2013 Realize you can buy good gear cheap in Nepal so don\u2019t worry about bringing it all. Just pack a few essentials that are your personal preference. For example, we bought Black Diamond trekking poles for $15/each vs. $100/each in the U.S. Were they imitation? Not sure, but they worked fine and saved us on our trek.\u2022 Be Fit \u2013 Trekking more than a day is Tough work! Practice hiking at home, running, stairmaster etc. so you can be in shape for the trek.\u2022 Bring Toilet Paper! - There is NO toilet paper in the toilets or teahouse lodges.\u2022 Water Proof Hikers \u2013 Comfortable Waterproof hikers are Essential. I chose the low-cut Salomon 3D and they worked well.\u2022 Foot inserts \u2013 try this trick \u2013 buy Dr. Scholls (or similar) foot cushions and insert those (remove the stock ones) if your feet get sore and it\u2019s like having another pair of shoes on the trail. \u2022 Get shower slippers \u2013 ok the showers are Gross so you should buy a pair of ultra-thin flip-flops to use for showering.\u2022 Micro-Towel \u2013 you may not find towels (or clean ones) in the lodges so you may want to pack a good micro-towel like the Sea to Summit antimicrobial towel from REI that packs down smaller than a banana. \u2022 Bring Energy \u2013 Recommend you bring protein bars, nuts, or energy chews (like Stinger or Bonk Buster) to help you through the trek.\u2022 Bring hand sanitizer \u2013 there is often no way to wash your hands.\u2022 Match gear to season - Warm weather is warm all the time except high altitudes so you only need 1-2 warm layers in summer etc.\u2022 Bring Rain Gear! \u2013 Highly recommend you bring a small packable raincoat and rain pants too. My choice for coat is the Helium II by Outdoor Research as it packs small and breathes well. Columbia makes good rain paints.\u2022 Get pack rain fly \u2013 In monsoon season particularly your pack will get soaked so invest in a rain cover.\u2022 Bring Hair+Body Wash \u2013 I\u2019ve found the shampoo in Nepal was not that good for hair&body washing. There will be None in the basic lodges. My go-to is Bronners soap which can be used for washing hair, body, clothes etc. it gets the grime off and packs easily.\u2022 Bring hydration tablets \u2013 you will sweat bullets on the trek and need to replenish electrolytes. These are also required in tropical climates or to prevent dehydration due to stomach problems.\u2022 Bring Sleeping liner \u2013 The tea lodges are not always clean. The beds are often dirty so a sleeping bag liner is highly recommended to use so that you don\u2019t need to get into a dirty bed. The coolmax green bag liner with bug protection is my lifesaver. It packs down to the size of a grapefruit, breathes well, and protects against mosquitos and bed bugs too. In an unclean room I\u2019ll Only sleep in my liner and even in tropical climates I\u2019ll sleep on top of the other blankets on my liner.

He adjusted our itinerary so that we could see some of the most beautiful places, taking us to temples in Kathmandu and to Patan, walking between buildings and houses to some beautiful hidden places. We ended with a relaxing dinner at a roof-top restaurant overlooking Boudhanath.We felt that our guide really went above and beyond to make this an unforgettable experience for us despite the short time. I would highly recommend Makalu Adventure!"

My friends and I spent four days cycling in Kathmandu Valley. A driver went to pick us up at the aiport. We stayed first night in a very nice little hotel, very quiet in the centre of Kathmandu. Next day we met Mohan. He arrived on time and was very professional. I have emailed him several times asking lots of questions, and he always answered on the same day. We went to rent out bikes and there we met our guite. He was very friendly as well. The route Mohan chose for us was amazing. We really had a wonderful time, everything organised by him. Last day, he invited us for dinner in a local restaurant where some dancers performed typical nepali dance. The food was amazing. I recommend this company hundred per cent. Mohan is a exceptional boss, as we were told by several of his employers. He listened to our preferences and requests. We would like to book another trip with his company"

Makalu Adventure Travel is quite simply one of the best tour companies to experience the magnificence of the Himalayan region: either side of the border \u2013 Nepal or Tibet. The care and attention from Mohan Lamsal, the Managing Director and his team from my recent trip there was unsurpassed \u2013 with every attention to detail so well taken care of, that by the time you leave, you feel a part of the Makalu family. Whatever trip you dream up, the talented team at Makalu will make it a reality. The local guides are top notch and will provide you with a deep understanding of the region. I was fortunate to have spent time with various guides in both Nepal and Tibet visiting monasteries and golden temples with the majestic Himalayan Mountains as the backdrop, along with the chance of a lifetime to travel to the base camp at Mt. Everest in Tibet. I also submerged myself in the ancient capitals of Kathmandu and Lhasa where I learned so much about the local customs and met so many wonderful people. During my time there, I wanted to find a way to help after the devastation wrought by the powerful earthquake, and Mohan arranged for me to visit Taruka, one of the hill towns north of Kathmandu that was severely damaged. Mohan and his team have been on the ground since the earthquake hit providing assistance and help to families of Taruka and are now overseeing the construction of three schools in the area (with one already completed thanks to past travelers of Makalu). During our time at Taruka, we spent several hours with the school children in their temporary schools made from bamboo and blue tarp. We read them stories and handed out school supplies and by the time we left the children had completely stolen our hearts. If you want to help out in writing the next chapter of Nepal then please do visit this magnificent country -- they have done so much work to recover from the earthquake and you will be amazed at how little evidence there in the aftermath of this earthquake in Kathmandu and the major tourist areas. And while you are visiting Nepal, you can always visit Taruka for yourself and see the tremendous progress being made there. Namaste and happy travels!"

I and my boyfriend, Jason, traveled to Nepal looking for a local experience. We wanted to eat incredible food, live with a family, and really experience life as a Nepali. Of course, we also hoped to see the standard city sites as well. When we arrived, Mohan picked us up, gave us warm welcomes and brought us to a beautiful home. We were greeted by an adorable young boy. I asked Mohan, \"How do you know this family?\". He answered, \"This is my family. This is my son, Sampson.\" Though the next five days, I would grow to learn about the history of Nepal, its struggles with the earthquake, complex government relations with neighboring countries, and understand so much about the character and dedication of the Nepali people. Mohan's incredible wife, cooked us many meals, fed us fresh fruit, and always had flavorful milk tea at the ready. She made us feel like home. I came home and told my own mother that my Nepali mother in Kathmandu takes care of me better than she does. :) Mohan's two sons were amazing. The eldest, a highschool senior, is full of potential, and told us about aspirations of coming to the states. He also mentioned Mohan's difficult career starts, as a porter. On a way to dinner one evening, the son casually mentioned Mohan getting emotional while being interviewed about his beginnings. His story is a happy one because his family is well cared for. All of Mohan's hard work has earned him an incredible reputation of being a knowledgeable trekker, a caretaker, and well connected. During these five days, we visited a guesthouse that Mohan co-owns, and learned about a yoga retreat that he manages. We also had dinner with a group of trekkers from Switzerland who have trekked with Mohan and his company over TWENTY times. This time, they weren't returning to trek. They were returning to rebuild a school. This is an example of the connections that Mohan creates. I was floored and amazed. Also during the trip, there was a group of trekkers on a hike, and one was sick from altitude sickness. Mohan frequently visited to make sure that he was comfortable and feeling okay. I truly believe that his team goes above and beyond.DUring our five day stay, we saw many things that the city had to offer. We also took a trip up north to Bhattedanda Homestay, where we learned about the story of Fulmaya Tamang. This was an incredible experience because we were able to understand one woman's plight to fend for her family. She started a women's co-operative and empowered many families to send their children to school, and many women to make a respectable income. I would come back to Nepal in a heartbeat, and I highly recommend Mohan and Makalu."

Makalu Adventures provided a wonderful experience as both a first visit (for my wife) and re-introduction to this fascinating country. The first couple of days was spent in Kathmandu where Makalu provided superb city guides to help us navigate the rich heritage of the area, providing interesting information without overloading us. From Kathmandu, we transferred to Pokhara where Makalu Adventures had selected a wonderful pre-trek hotel for us. The five day trek was led by Tenzing and took us past verdant paddy fields and up through the rhododendron forests to the summit of Poon Hill and back. The guest houses were always welcoming and the no one could have done more to help ensure that we enjoyed ourselves. Our guide and porter were happy to let us walk at our own pace and helped create a fantastic experience that will stay with us for a long time. We had a couple of nights in Pokhara post-trek and then back to Kathmandu where we visited Bhaktapur before doing last minute tourist shop and heading to the airport. Throughout, Makalu Adventures went out of their way to ensure that we had a fantastic experience in Nepal. All staff were so helpful and we look forward to returning in a few years. Many thanks indeed to Mohan and the team for such a fantastic trip."

The organization, accommodations, schedule, meals, guides, cooks, price were perfect. The main guide did his best to ensure safety - following the latest protocols on altitude sickness avoidance (climb high, sleep low, acclimatization climbs, limit daily altitude gain), reminding me to be careful around yaks and steep trail sections. The guide carried my mountaineering gear etc, which is essential: it is very difficult to get used to the altitude even with a light pack. Got assistance with every meal etc.I successfully reached Kalapathar to view Everest, the valley of the base camp, the Khumbu ice fall, etc. Seemed like more than half failed due to previous overexertion or altitude sickness. Note, if you go to Everest Base Camp, you only go to the tourist part where you stand on the edge of the glacier and get a picture by a sign. The actual EBC climbers don't want visitors bringing illness.I successfully climbed Island Peak with assistance from an excellent climbing guide. It was a very long day starting at 1am, but I made it! After a very long climb in the dark, you have to climb a very steep snow field with fixed lines and an ice axe.The organizers helped keep the trip on schedule even with unforseen problems, including weather-related flight delays and a severe fuel crisis. (They also helped me in trying to fix a mistake I made.) Several other travelers were repeat customers. If you're comparing companies, be sure to compare itinery and what is included / excluded from the final price. You'll be shocked at what US-based travel companies are trying to charge for the exact same trip.The Nepalese have worked hard to prepare for tourists after the earthquake. Many of the tourist areas have been rebuilt. Everything was open for tourism. There were daily power outages in Kathmandu, but did not affect meals or the day trips.Thanks again, Makalu Adventures!"

We did the Jiri to Everest base camp walk with 4 Sherpa. Makalu's organisation was terrific in every area. We really enjoyed walking with our Sherpas, we liked that it was the low season and not many tourists. You do have to have good gear though as it was often very cold and the heating in the hotels mostly is in the main eating areas, we often ended up in the kitchens with the families - WHICH WE LOVED! Of course we loved the spectacular mountains, but for us the best part was walking in from Jiri to the National Park, the Nepalise in the villages on the way were so friendly and welcoming, it was less commercial. Our Makalu guide was terrific, and in the early days while we got our walking legs sorted he would help massage calves, knees and thighs that ached so much ...and got us on our feet so we made it to Kala Patar! Our porters and support person/cook were lovely people and so helpful. Some of the huts right up high such as Dengbouche were very cold in the bedrooms, it is essential to have sleeping bags in this area that can deal with minus 20 and good clothes - and good hiking boots, we did. In the winter low season in the really cold places you need to sleep with camera batteries - they freeze! The food we were served on the way was excellent,(we had garlic soup every night and dahl bhat for lunch every day - we never got tired of it.. and sometimes one of the Makalu team would cook - he was great! Best Hash browns and eggs for breakfast I've ever had! The Hotel we stayed at in Kathmandu was fantastic - and very welcome after 20 days in the mountains trekking! The staff in Kathmandu and on the road were fantastic and great so helpful and accommodating, they were wonderful company! Especially we liked the evenings all huddled around the potbelly fires talking with our sherpas and hotel staff.We really want to come back soon and organise another holiday - thank you Makalu Adventures - you are a very efficient, friendly and professional company.

However Mohan didn't seem phased by our rather unusual request and organised a trip that absolutely surpassed our expectations in every way possible!

The whole trip was fantastic and worked perfectly well which is mainly due to the perfect organization of Makalu Adventures. In particular during the hike to the Mt. Everest Advanced Base Camp the team benefited from the experience of the participating tour guide, and the other sherpas and yakmen. Except for that, the sightseeing tours in Tibet were guided by a knowledged local who gave much valuable background information. Therefore, I can strongly recommend Makalu Adventures for such adventure trips in that region."

Once i met the Sherpa's and Organisers from Makalu adventures most of my worries went away (altitude sickness was still a concern). They were very reasuring and knowledgeable as well as treating us to some great Nepalise customs and tours. Once the cycle ride began in Lhasa all my worries went away. The sherpa's were the most supportive and encourgaing people I have ever met. They even carried my bag from the truck to the tent / hotel after a long day in the sadle. The food was excellent, so good we asked if we could have 'pappa' cook for us every night even when in hotels. The only warning i have is learn how to repair and look after your bike before starting the ride! i had to learn along the way, and thanks to the group i was with i am now at least if not more knowledgeable than my friends back home :) I would definutly recomend Makalu Adventures."

Makalu really gave us value for money, and although the trip was tough, it was more than worthwhile in all aspects. Makalu personnel went out of their way to make sure that we were satisfied. If you ever consider doing this trip, Makalu is the way to go."

We aimed to capture images of the stunning mountains, the friendly dignity of its hard working people, and the colour, richness and meaning of its varied faiths. All of us in the group achieved remarkable success. As I had a lung dissease, it was with some trepidition that I agreed to take on the challenge of going to 4,000 metres, but though very difficult, it was worth the effort. Needless to say, I could not have managed to get so far without the excellent, careful, detailed planning and organisation of Mr Mohan's travel company Makalu Adventures. Oxygen was even available if I needed it, which thankfully I did not. It was the most thoroughly organised photography trip I have been on, and I have been on nine previous trips all over the world.I can thoroughly recommend Makalu Adventures for all those travellers who want to travel to such remote places in the world, who want the security of knowing their hotels, food, transport and guides will be skilled and reliable. Their needs will be met. And on top of all that, the price is so reasonable. What more could you ask?"

Mohan is a first class individual who listens and acts upon any recommendation.Our three trips have been of a demanding nature-There are only two of us and we need to rely on competent professional staff. Our most recent trip took in the demanding Tilmans Pass in the Langtang region. We encountered very heavy snow up high and the temperatures plummeted. Fortunately our climbing Sherpa and guide ensured both the porters and our safety.In short, if you wish to trek or climb in Nepal do yourself a favour and utilize the considerable talents of Makalu."

Not only were we exposed to the breathtaking mountain vistas, but we were also given a taste of the rich cultural and spiritual heritage of Nepal. Throughout our trip, Makalu's obvious expertise and experience in organizing these types of tours shone through and was evident in their professional but friendly approach, amazing attention to detail and seamless planning and execution. Their ability to adapt to unexpected changes, be it weather, illness, delayed flights, obstinate yaks or forced accommodation changes was most impressive. I would recommend them without any reservation! Martin Huysamer."

All of the arrangements were excellent and we enjoyed every minute with the guides, cooks, and porters supplied by Makalu Adventure Tours. During that time I had 7 women freinds from Boise join me for an 18 day tour of KTM and the Langtang trek. All of the women were pampered by the guides, cooks, and porters. The cooks made excellent meals and their attention to cleaniness benefitted the group and no one got sick.We would highly recommend Makalu Adventure Tours because Mohan, the owner, is very personable and attends to all of your wishes. The reasonable pricing of the tours is also very helpful for those of us who want an experienced crew and accomodations at not a high cost."

I was introduced to Mr. Harikrishna by a good friend of mine. We were discussing all details of my future trip online prior to the start and I got answers to all my questions. The trip we made was in Langtang, it was designed on my request, and there's no need to say how beautiful it is there) I'm a person difficult to surprize, I have an outdoor experience and used to do everything myself, but even for me the help of Hari and his team was essential. For the begginers it would be an absolute must.I want also to emphasis that Mr. Harikrishna is an active member of his community. He is well-known in a neighborhood for a very important reason- he runs a lot of charity projects for people living next to him. He has build a big modern hospital near his home village Jibjibe in Langtang, and at the moment he's going through the paper legalization process for school building in the area. In his plans are 3 schools to build this year and he hopes to increase this number next year. He also supports many poor families around by paying the education fees for their kids in order to let the kids study and get a chance for a better life and future of next generation. Most of the guides working in his company where educated and trained at his cost for the same reason - to give the countryside people a chance for a better life. All the money Harikrishna spends on his projects are earned by his company tour services or donated later on by his grateful customers. Don't let go of an opportunity to become one of them!"

He helped us organise our trek in Nepal and we couldn't have been happier with our experience. The best thing about Hari's approach is his ethical and moral stance, which many of the bigger trekking companies lack unfortunately. He takes very good care of all his staff and porters, making sure they are all well equipped, as well as supporting their families. He also runs several community support programmes across Nepal. If I return to Nepal, Hari would definitely be the first person I would go to! :-)"

The guide from High Himalayan Trekking picked us up directly from the airport. We had the time to visit Kathmandu and Pokara before heading to the Anapurnas. The guide was really nice and helpful. We felt taking care of during the whole trip without to have to worry about anything. We even managed to teach him how to play cards and we spend really nice evening playing cards together and getting to know Nepalese culture.We also liked the fact that High Himalyan Trekking is associated with a local NGO to support people in the mountain villages. It made us feel that our trip also help indirectly Nepalese people.Great choice for eco/sustainable tourism!"

Many friends who had been to Nepal had their own recommendations but when I contacted Hari the director of this company, with a rather specific request to do a not too tiresome trek, visit remote villages, and have a lot time for some meditation and writing, he came back to me with a variety of very appealing packages. Of the choices I decided to volunteer along with a group of French osteopaths and Doctors, and had the very easy job of helping out with the intake of patients for a couple of hours, with plenty of spare time to go off on my own, smoke the local ganja that grew everywhere, read, write, meditate and do yoga. It was an amazing soulful time I had, spending a couple of days at a time in these remote villages, near the Tibetan border.The biggest surprise of all though was just how good the meals were that we received. Each meal was delicious and plentiful. We ate like kings. I hadn't expected that. The company also assisted me purchase art in Kathmandu, and organised a guide (a really sweet college student) for next to nothing, to keep me company while shopping, exploring, eating out around Kathmandu, after mtg journey was done. I saw that Hari is one really well-connected guy in Nepal. He knows everyone!When I now consider the low cost of this incredible trek, I can't think of where else I've found such value for money. I will be back to Nepal again sometime, and Ill have High HimalayanTrekking design another choose-your-own adventure for me again."

Initially when planning a 18 days trek in the Himalayas, which was something I always wanted to do, it seemed so hard and impossible to do....I didn't know what to expect or how to go about making it a reality...I had researched all my options but that didn't even scratch the surface of the reality of the experience.I was lucky to come across High Himalayan Trekking and Expedition through a friend who had done it and they couldn't stop raving about it and Hari and his team. They take care of everything so you can focus on enjoying yourself and the impeccable environment...The brilliant thing is that you can tailor make your trek to just how you want it...This was my highlight...so instead of booking a tour that just tells you what to do, you also have the option (as I like) to choose your own adventure or add to an established route...Further to that, our friendly and laid back guides went above and beyond...they knew everyone in all villages and were well respected....I now consider 'my team' friends for life and we have stayed in touch ever since...Until I visit again which is on the agenda!I can't recommend High Himalayan Trekking and Expedition enough....You will not regret it! Just do it...It will change your life for the better! Frankly, it is one of the best experiences of my life!Good luck and thank me later!"

We visted local schools and were given a royal welcome by all the villager's and school children. Our tour guide Hari was so well known in the villagers that the locals welcomed us into their homes and schools and gave us incredible insight into their way of life and traditions. Most rewarding of all was being able to contribute to some of the schools in this region. The way Hari structures the tour meant we were able to see exactly where our support went, and unlike larger tour companies there were no hidden costs or skimming off the top...I recommend Hari and his team 100%"

We stayed with local families in the mountain huts, ate amazing pancakes, and I even got used to the mind-blowing Mustang coffee (stuff with rum - a must-try).

This was our first trek with Epic Adventures and from the very start they were very helpful, organising permits, providing excellent guide and porters, air transport to Pokhara and land travel back to Kathmandu. Our party of four found the trek both challenging and rewarding, especially walking through rhododendron forests, seeing the sunrise on Poon Hill, and up close and personal with the mountains at Annapurna Base Camp. The majority of our hotels were excellent, food was always plentiful and good and we met some incredible people along the way.Nepal is recovering slowly from the earthquake and the Nepalese trekking community need tourists to return in order for them to continue what they do best - look after tourists to the very best of their ability.Can thoroughly recommend Epic Adventures for any trekking you may consider."

Shreeram and the whole team at Epic Adventures epitomize this attitude and helped me organize loads of great activities:- rafting and trekking through the Anapurna region (Dambar was the perfect buddy and guide on my Poon Hill trip as we laughed and joked our way up and down thousands and thousands of steps and trails and rafted together on the way to Pokhara)- the two day trip to Chitwan included a great hotel, an awesome cultural show and a chance to see the beautiful white rhinos and a baby calf.- organize my travel and visas for a 5 day trip to Bhutan.I honestly can't comment about price because I didn't look any further after witnessing the professionalism and friendly attitude of the Epic team.

Everyone in the group made it to Annapurna base camp due to excellent advice, guidance and help from our chief guide Pravin and the team of porters and assistant guides. Despite last minute flight changes on the part of some of the group, Epic adventures adapted the itinerary and booked an extra night in a hotel in Kathmandu for some members of the group at short notice. The trekking was well organised with helpful porters staying with the group and helping members of the group when necessary. Pravin did a great job checking everyone was OK and monitoring everyone's progress to ensure no one was left without guidance from porters or the assistant guide. Food was very good within the limits of the teahouse facilities, the scenery and the people of Nepal were fantastic. Only downside is Kathmandu airport, leave plenty of time to check in as the queues for immigration can be very long."

But there are two things that really set Shree and his team apart from the rest. The first is flexibility. I met about thirty of Epic's customers, and most of them decided to change or add something to their trip while they were out trekking. Shree seems to know everyone in Nepal and can rebook and make these changes for you in minutes! But the biggest difference is Shree. He treats his crew like family. He only hires people he knows, and everyone wants to work for him. This means your guide, your porter, your cook, even your jeep driver, your pilot, etc., LOVE their job, and LOVE working for Shree. And they'll make sure that you love every minute of your trip. Most importantly to me, Epic Adventures Nepal is a philanthropic company. Beyond what he does for his crew, Shree was one of the first responders to the earthquakes in 2015, providing food and medical attention to many remote villages long before any other aid arrived. He's even rebuilding the school in his hometown.I literally had the best time of my life with Shree, Rajan, Pravin and the rest of the Epic Adventures crew. I feel like I'm part of their family. Anyone can SEE Nepal, but if you want to really experience the country, the people, and the culture, call Epic Adventures Nepal."

At every step of the way, we were cared for extremely well. Our needs were anticipated before we were even aware of them, and time and time again the Epic Adventures team went above and beyond what we expected of them to ensure that our first visit to Nepal was a memorable one. We got engaged on the back of an elephant, saw sights that we had only dreamed of, and fell in love with the team that lead us at every step of the way. I cannot highly enough of the Epic Adventures team, the world needs more people like this."

From the moment you arrive at the airport everything is taken care off. The hotel that was booked for us was way more that expected, modern rooms with comfortable beds. We were taken on a city tour the day before heading off on our expedition, and the guide answered any questions we had, explaining everything in detail for us. I would like to thank Shree and his team for the most memorable experience of my life.

The scenery is incredible. Be aware that accommodation is very basic ( bathroom and toilet especially) so you should be ready for it. You are also very likely to spend the night before the pass in a tent at 4400m as there almost no rooms there. It adds so fun memories to your trip but pack some warm clothes!Finally keshab, our guide , Prakash, yadop and bassu were an amazing crew taking great care of our safety and needs at all Times.

He was very patient, answering our hundred and one questions via email while we were working on our itinerary. We had planned to trek to Jomsom and fly to Pokhara, but upon hearing of a recent plane crash on that route Chhatra contacted us and suggested some alternatives, which was much appreciated. Having not been trekking at altitude before we selected to trek with a guide and porter. Our porter, Bishnu, was excellent. Our guide, Tshering, was very experienced. He knew the route very well and pointed out landmarks, some local history and the names of the mountain peaks as we trekked along. Both Bishnu and Tshering were courteous, never making us feel rushed and making sure they never lost sight of us or left us behind, particularly when we got higher in altitude. After having planned an itinerary with Chhatra, Tshering made changes from the outset without discussing the changes with us. As it turns out, this allowed us additional time at the end in Pokhara (and we really liked Pokhara), but we would've preferred to have a discussion about the changes first. Not all of the guesthouses we stayed in were ones we would've selected for ourselves, so if we come back to Nepal we would agree with the guide/company to select our own guesthouses along the way. Annapurna is an excellent trek; we would definitely recommend it and would recommend Nepal Eco Adventure."

So I decided to boot the Everest Base Camp Trek + Island Peak, which was a really good decision!Everything was arranged perfectly: the airport pickup, the Kathmandu sightseeing tour, the trek to Everest base camp, and the climb to Island peak. The trek to EBC was absolutely amazing. We had the best guide: Keshab. A great, knowledgeable local guide, always happy to help. Also we had two great porters: Bishnu and Santa, very strong guys. The trek is demanding (but very doable with some mountain experience) but really beautiful, great views!! Very nice lodges, especially the small ones owned by local family. And surprisingly good food, just make sure to be a vegetarian during the trek for safety reasons ;)The climb to Island Peak was really an unforgettable experience. Camping close to a glacier lake surrounded by beautiful mountains. Crazy mountain chickens. And a very, very demanding climb to the top. If you want it bad enough you can make it. What an astonishing view from the top. After the trek chhatra helped us to plan the rest of our trip to Pokhara, kayaking and Chitwan NP. We really had a great time in Nepal.I absolutely recommend this company! You will be assured of great service and an excellent Nepal experience!!"

I have lived at sea level (Florida, USA) for the past decade and in no way trained for this experience. But it's Nepal and trekking is pretty much the top tourist magnet here. Turns out, it's totally worth the hype.This was my first visit to Nepal and a visa was pretty easy to get on arrival. Tourism is their biggest industry and it\u2019s down significantly after the earthquake so I highly recommend a visit. Normally I travel independently but I was glad I booked my trek with Chhatra & Nepal Eco Adventure (instead of trekking solo) because all the transportation and trekking permits were included. Pro tip: Bring several extra passport photos with you for the permits! That being said, the trips aren\u2019t 100% all inclusive. You\u2019ll need some money for souvenirs, meals in the cities and to tip your guide and porter and the end of your trek. The 10-day Annapurna Circuit trekking trip I enjoyed during March 2016 actually included a tour of Kathmandu beforehand which happened to be during the annual Holi Festival so it was an extra treat! All of the accommodations were clean and comfortable. You will also have a few nights in Pokhara, which is a beautiful little lakeside town with all the comforts of home to enjoy before and after your trek. Obviously the rooms are a little more rustic once you get on the trail, but they all had solar-powered hot showers and hot food. I am a solo female traveler but was glad to be grouped with fellow trekkers Julienne from Canada, Deepak from Singapore and our guides Kumar and Babu. This wasn\u2019t due to safety - I felt totally safe during my almost month total travels in Nepal - it is more the social aspect and having a few others to share this incredible experience with. D and I also shared a porter named Subus. (A porter carries your bag for you.) Everyone was so friendly and helpful and Kumar and Babu even prepared fresh fruit for us every night as an extra treat! The weather was amazing but the temperature obviously gets cooler the higher you hike so you make sure you have layers. I recommend packing as light as possible. You really don\u2019t need much: two changes of clothes plus an under-layer, hiking books plus one pair of sandals/shower shoes, scarf, hat, sunglasses and small, basic toiletries. Electricity and wifi can be spotty so just bring one electronic necessity like a smartphone or a camera. Pro tip: If you forget mittens or gloves like I did, just use an extra pair of socks!"

Chhatra was extremely efficient in organizing everything from our arrival at Kathmandu to flights to-from pokkahara as well as the major part of the trip which was our Mustang trek. Since I was not in my best shape possible and found myself straggling at end of the trekking party most of the time, there was always one guide beside me to assess if I needed help and to encourage me to push on. The overwhelming sense of satisfaction I achieved when I completed the trek can be attributed to them. Overall this was a life-changing experience and I'll definitely be back."

Chhatra (head of the company) is responsible person and answers all your questions before the trip. Also he is always trying to meet your wishes. We had two porters -Omit and Poti (sorry for the probably wrong writing) on 5 people and one guide - Shiva. They all were friendly with us and helpful. Especially I would like to thank Poti, who was very responsive and kind, great person! Shiva was ready to answer the questions about current place, culture and nature and was very polite. Our group was very diverse in a sense of physical training, mountaineering experience and age, but the Eco team found good approach. Also we had never lost the way. We think that our driver - Shreehari was the best driver in Nepal, many thanks to him one more time. After the trekking we had an excursion to the Kathmandu valley (Heritage tour). Our guide had a deep knowledge about the area and good English, showed a lot of amazing places. All team members were in time and picked us up directly at the hotel. Many thanks to all of you Nepal Eco Adventure members!'-': After the trip guys, who helped with rucksacks, were very disappointed about received tips, it was about 35 $ per person for 10 days. We paid to the company good money and were sure that guys have good salary. It was not a big pleasure to have such reaction taking into account that for us the price tour was not an easy weight. It seems that their salary is very small even in such company. Before the trip we talked with Chhatra about two peaks on a way: Tsergo Ri and Surya peaks. They both do not have technical difficulties. And our guide was aimed to show the way. With Tsergo Ri all was ok, however when we came to second one, Shiva did not know the way, which is of course can be, but he did not ask local people about the best route (there are several). After our question he talked with a men in our tea house and suggested one rout in an abstract manner. But he said that he will not go, because it is quite dangerous and did not recommend us to do it either, but this men can show the way for 10000 NPR. For my parents we ordered before the trekking trip to Nagarkot. In the end of the dry season there is zero visibility on the top of the hill, it is better to know this in advance."

Although, July is rainy season in Nepal, I decided to make the best of it and contacted Chhatra to get a trekk organized for me. Chhatra answered all my emails, which where both many and detailed, without any delay and within a few days he had a 9 days trekk to Annapurna Base Camp organized for me. Many thanks for all your help Chhatra! July is not a good month for trekking with all the rain and I was prepared for the worst. However, I got surprisingly many days with sunshine and good visibility. As well as a morning in the base camp when the clouds lifted from the mountains and the beautiful Annapurna was revealed to me. Having a porter and guide was really excellent. Especially since my guide, Bijayrah Karki, was very knowledgeable about birds and we had many excellent bird sightings. Definitely a good idea to have a guide with an interest that is interesting to talk about when walking through the forests up to higher ground. When returning to Kathmandu, I also got a very interesting cultural tourist tour of Kathmandu with Raju Suwal and I was amazed with his detailed knowledge about Kathmandu. One item to keep in mind when organizing a trip like this, I took the 7,5 hours bus between Pokhara and Kathmandu after returning from the trekk. Although, the scenery is great, 7,5 hours is a very long trip on bad roads. Next time I will pay the extra to fly home to Kathmandu rather than taking the bus. To sum up, a surprisingly good trekk despite being rainy season and a very well organized tour by Eco Adventure. Many thanks to you all at Nepal Eco!"

This was BY FAR the most fulfilling trip of my life, and I am so very thankful I chose Nepal Eco Adventure to help get me there. I admit there was a lot of anxiety about the trip before making the 8,000 mile journey to Kathmandu but whatever worries and concerns I had were quickly diminished after dealing with both the tour operator, Chhatra, and then with my Guide Bijay.  To start with, my flight was cancelled the day of to Abu Dhabi and the next wasn't available until 3 days later. I was so stressed that I was going to have to find a new guide company but Chhatra replied to my email immediately saying that he took care of it and rescheduled my trip AT NO EXTRA CHARGE! That includes my ticket from Kathmandu to Lukla, my guide who was to meet me in the city, as well as any lodging issues.  When I finally made it to Kathmandu I was introduced to my guide. I was honestly a little nervous about this as well, seeing as how I was gonna be spending day and night travelling with this person for two and a half weeks, but we got on great! Bijay was attentive, knowledgeable, and always carried a warm personality even when I was ill with altitude sickness. He made sure to get me a bed in the nicest lodges available and had fresh fruit every evening to go with my dinner. My oxygen levels were checked twice a day and we walked at MY pace, which made a big difference.  If you want to have the greatest adventure of your life, going in with confidence that you will be taken care of the entire way with a very professional company then I can't reccomend Nepal Eco Adventure enough!!!!! Have fun, and ask for Bijay!!!"

I spent close to 40 days in Nepal in April/May of 2016. I booked solo and met fantastic people in my hiking group and while hiking. Both the Annapurna Circuit and EBC/Chola/Gokyo are beautiful in their own way. I highly recommend doing both treks if it is your first time in Nepal. Chhatra is super organized and everything was taken care of. The lodges we stayed at were fine - no thrills but none needed - you're in the mountains in the Himalayan range which is all you can ask for. Our guide was great - Narayen. He knew all the ins and outs. The only snag we unfortunately ran into was in Lukla on our way back to Kathmandu at the end of the trip - but most of that was due to unfavorable weather, causing us to spend an extra 2 days in Lukla trying to catch a flight out. Perhaps more attention could have been given here to prioritize us on a flight out but it is what it is, no biggie. All in all, my experience in Nepal and with Eco Adventure was excellent. Please don't take high elevation lightly - make sure you've tested your body with previous high altitude hikes/climbs - just a general statement. Nepal is a beautiful nation and the people in the countryside are genuine and goodhearted."

As part of a group trek, I did the Everest Base Camp & 3 Passes (Kongma La, Cho La, Renjo La) trek with Nepal Eco Adventure this Apr 2016, spanning around 3 weeks. This was a challenging and strenuous high altitude trek with all 3 passes above 18,000 ft, EBC at 17,500 ft and Kala Patthar at 18,500 ft. Chhatra Karki, who runs Nepal Eco, carried out the entire planning and logistics for this trek. Chhatra is extremely knowledgeable about the routes on this trek and was very responsive, detailed, helpful and flexible right from the first interaction we had till much after completing the trek. The trek guides and porters he provided were strong & competent, had a focus on safety, were polite and helpful and most of them had prior experience trekking these routes. Boarding, lodging and food was excellent throughout the trek relative to the tea house facilities available on these routes. Chhatra\u2019s information and advice around weather conditions, altitude sickness, safety, health, water & food aspects were very useful. Later during the trek as we improvised on the itinerary to save time, Chhatra responded flexibly (and patiently), at short notice, in re-booking flights, boarding & lodging to accommodate our changes. The trek in itself, for the most part, comprised of long 5-8 hour walks over 15000 ft, through steep inclines, snowy & icy paths, huge glaciers, moraine, scree and pretty cold conditions. These challenges, however, were well rewarded with magnificent views of the highest Himalayan ranges, stunning landscapes, mesmerizing alpine lakes, unique flora & fauna, serene monasteries, beautiful countryside, great food and lovely local people. All in all a truly memorable trek! As regards areas for improvement, some of the trek guides could develop deeper knowledge about the culture and history of the local places and people on these routes that would add to enriching the overall experience. Kumar Jirel, one of the trekking guides, while competent, could develop a bit more empathy for client trekkers not as experienced. As a disclaimer, I am not affiliated in any way or work for Nepal Eco nor do I write too many reviews. But, that said, I would have no hesitation in trekking again with Nepal Eco and would recommend them for those looking to trek in Nepal."

Last spring I did a 18 days trek in Sagarmatha National Park with my husband (30 years old) and my parents (58 and 65) - my best trekking experience ever! I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure and this trek, a beautiful and challenging one called the Three High Passes Trek. This was my second time in Nepal. The first time I was with another trekking company and Nepal Eco Adventure was definitely much better although the trek costed exactly the same price. Before the trek, Chhatra was very helpful and responsive, he gave us great advice to help us choose the trek and the equipment. Then he took care of everything very efficiently for us, including the trek permit and the hotel reservation in Kathmandu where he made sure we had the best rooms. The trek was wonderful, beautiful landscapes and people and excellent accomodation. Many of the owners of the lodges were good friends of our guide so there was also a nice and fun atmosphere. Our guide Rajesh was very friendly but also serious and responsible and he knew everything about the area. He spoke excellent English and some French too :) He told us a lot of interesting stories and we learned a lot about the Sherpa culture and Nepal in general thanks to him. Our porters, Man and Chhitra, were incredibly nice, friendly and helpful, they understood English well and we had an excellent time with them. Rajesh was very flexible and clever. When we arrived at EBC, my parents were very tired, they found the trek too challenging, had altitude sickness and didn't feel like crossing the remaining high passes. Instead of having the four of us go down together, Rajesh proposed an alternative that suited everyone: my parents went down with one of the porters while my husband and I continued and did the whole trek. The four of us were extremely pleased with our experience and if we come back to Nepal for a trek we will definitely choose Nepal Eco Adventure again."

Chhatra was very patient and offered a lot of good advice and assistance in helping us achieve this dream. He was always quick to reply our emails/questions, and always polite and courteous. His staff are also all very professional and friendly. We had Rajesh as our guide.

We were a bit slower on the trek, but Rajesh was very patient the whole way. We met quite a few other trekkers on this trip, and I really can't say the same about other trekking companies. We met guides who argued with their clients. There were also guides from other companies who drank too much off duty. My advice is be careful who you hire, and really consider Nepal Eco Adventures to make sure your holiday is safe and enjoyable. I don't work for Nepal Eco Adventures. I don't get commission from them. I am just another tourist from Canada. I don't write too many reviews but this awesome company really deserves a mention."

My husband did the Everest base camp trek last year and thought that it would be a good idea for us to do the upper mustang trek together. We did have our apprehensions but decided to just do it. We met part of our team in Kathmandu upon arrival at the airport and the others at Chattra's office and I felt like I could trust and connect with them almost immediately. After enjoying the chaos of Kathmandu and the calmness of Pokkhara, we took our flight up to Jomsom together with our guides Shiva and Narayan. We met our horseman Binod and his 2 horses. We rented 2 horses for the kids in case they got tired of walking. But I ended up riding the horse whenever I had a chance as it was so enjoyable. We also met our third guide Nikhil and our porter Munggal. Philipp our 8 year old decided that he was not comfortable on the horse on the first trekking day and Nikhil constructed a seat out of wood and cushion and piggy backed him through the mountains. They were inseparable after the second day.Narayan and Shiva were both great guides as they had different strengths. And we all got along well. Narayan had been on this trail often and he knew the trail inside out and shared stories about what the trail was like when it first opened up to tourists in 1992. Shiva shared lots of insights into the Nepalese culture and the current situation of the country after last year's earthquake. Although at certain points, we all experienced a certain degree of altitude sickness, were cold, got sick and were living outside of our comfort zone, we had full confidence in our team. The team was fun, my kids were happy, the adults were happy, the Dahl baht was good, my kids ate well, and the scenery was just amazing. We stopped at various tea houses and met strong resilient people who smiled a lot. I am humbled by our adventure and have a deep respect for the resilience of the people that we met in Nepal. Maybe we'll have another Himalayan adventure next year :)"

            "review": "Everest Base Camp amd Chola Pass with Nepal Eco Adventure. I have trekked with Nepal Eco Adventure in April 2016. I was a bit nervous to embark on my journey as I never trekked before and it was my first time in Nepal, however Nepal Eco Adventure made me feel welcome and answered all my questions. Before arriving to Nepal I had several questions about the adventure, things to brings and what to expect. I contacted the company several times and got responses right away ( within 1or 2 hours) to all my questions. Chattra was very helpful and made me feel right away at ease.Once I arrived to Nepal everything was well organized and went according to the schedule. We (my father and I) were greeted by our guide and transported to our hotel with explanations of what will happen the following day ( city tour and meeting at the agency to have an overview of our trip).The following day as planned we had our city tour, with beautiful sightseeing and explanations about the local culture, customs and life style. Later that day we were brought to the office to pick up equipment that we needed ( sleeping bag, trekking poles) . We also met our guide who explained to us what to pack with us and how next day will go ( flying to Lukla).Next day we were transported to the airport and since we had an early flight that was booked by Nepal Eco Adventure we were able to fly to Lukla within 1hr of arrival to airport. Once in Lukla our trekking began with beautiful scenery surrounding us. Our trek included Everest Base Camp and then Chola Pass and Gokyo Ri. Throughout the journey we received many explanations about what we were seeing and where we were going from our guide. Our oxygen level was measured every evening which was very helpful and just re-confirming that we were all in good shape to continue our trekking. The acclimatization days were also very helpful to adjust to high elevations.Overall the trekking was absolutely amazing, we met interesting people, saw beautiful scenery and had personal experiences that I won\u2019t forget.Once we arrived back to Katmandu we met again Chattra from Nepal Eco Adventure who asked us how our trip went. We can feel and I know he really cares about our experience and works hard to ensure that we have a great trip not only trekking but also once we are back to the city. We spend 2 days in the city upon which the company arranged airport pick up for us and we were transported to catch our plane and be back to the reality as Nepal seemed an absolute dream!!!! I strongly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure to anyone who is planning a trekking trip to Nepal. They have deliver on their service, attention and care!Thank you!!!!!I will be back, Nepal!!!"

            "review": "Everest base camp trek. I decided that the Everest base camp trek was to be my challenge for 2016- to help ease me into turning 30 :)So early last year I started googling different tour agencies and that's when I came across Nepal Eco adventure. after a quick look on trip advisor at the reviews I decided to send my prilimarily email. Chhattra was fantastic, all my queries, worries and general questions (there were a lot of them) were answered in a timely manner and much faster than I could have hoped for. For a solo female traveller this was enough to put my mind at ease and have trust that this company would look after my best interests. I didn't even bother to contact any other companies- it was decided that Nepal Eco adventure was whom I would travel with and I wasn't disappointed. I landed in Kathmandu on the 14/05/16 greeted at the airport by Ram and taken to the Nepal Access Hotel.I then went to meet chhattra, the team, paid my deposit and had a briefing on what to expect whilst trekking, which would commence on the 16/05/16On the 15/05/16 we had a guided tour of Kathmandu which was excellent and a great way to get to know the group of people I was trekking with.The 16th arrived and so did the dreaded flight to Lukla (actually it wasn't too bad- Goma air has nice new planes) to begin our 12 days of walking... Every day was absolutely fantastic! our lead guide Ram was extremely knowledgeable, kind and supportive. He made sure we were all ok and tailored each day to meet all of our needs at a pace that kept us all comfortable. Santosh our second guide was there to lead the guys with a faster pace and kept us all amused with his sense of humour. I can't praise these two enough and I'm glad I got to spend 12 days under there care. If we had any worries or concerns they soon put our minds to rest which made me feel safe and relaxed during the entire trip.Our days were spent walking- taking in the scenery and our evenings playing cards together. My only query although not big enough to knock a star off my rating was that I booked this as 16 days rather than the 15 stated on the website at the agreed price with chhattra and then received an email from him (whilst in Kathmandu) stating I had to pay an additional $40 to the hotel Access Nepal to stay the final night or find a new hotel. I would have understood if this had of been mentioned at the time of booking the trip but it was a little inconvenient whilst actually in Nepal when I was under the impression that everything was paid for in the itinerary I received at the time of booking.Regardless of this, Overall the Everest base camp trip surpassed my expectations, I had the most fantastic time. I made friendships that will last a lifetime and to be in the company of the great Himalayas is an experience I shall treasure forever! You can't beat the knowledge and attentiveness of the guides, and the speedy response from chhattra, In my opinion you can't beat it and I would recommend everyone to use Nepal Eco adventures for their travels in Nepal.Hopefully I'll be back soon to tackle Annapurna :) thanks for everything Sam"

All the way from BhuleBhule to Porkhara.As an inexperienced and unfit trekker, it was nice to have a very knowledgeable and one of the most nicest guide and of course porter ever. Bam was familiar with the route and all the significant points and views. I found it convenient for me to have someone help with my luggage and a well laid out itinerary. That is what I would call a nice vacation. Hands off!!Remember to bring a camera, for those who love photgraphy, some reading material, some nice music for those who love their own company and some nice companion. But like a friend of mine said, always remember to savour the moment with your eyes before you take it all in the camera.In short, It was one of the best experiences I have had in my life."

With 3 weeks to prepare and as a solo female traveller, I feel lucky to have found Nepal Eco Adventures. From the very first correspondence, I knew I was in good hands and all the positive reviews only reinforced my feelings. Chhatra was very responsive and patient with my multiple email inquiries. I considered different times and trek options, eventually settling on doing the EBC trek with Gokyo Lakes and Cho La Pass. Even though it was longer than the standard EBC trek, it made for a more unique and breathtaking loop. The trek was very well planned \u2013 including 2 days in Kathmandu before flying to Lukla, and then having 3 extra days at the end to allow to return to Kathmandu in case of bad weather in Lukla. Our group actually experienced weather related delays on the way back, so I was lucky to have had all these extra days, otherwise, I\u2019d miss my international flight back to Canada. About the trek \u2013 it was a trip of a lifetime with breathtaking scenery, wonderful people, and memories that will last forever. Again, I was lucky to find myself in a group with 3 other travellers, all from different countries and even continents. We all got along great, had similar pace when trekking, and had a wonderful time overall. Narayan Rai was our guide. Not only does he have extensive trekking, mountaineering, and rescue experience, but I swear he knows all the local people and speaks a bit of all languages that you may encounter on the trek. Always in a good mood, smiling, and positive, he is a very gifted \u201cpeople person\u201d. Narayan made our experience very special by choosing to bring us to very interesting Tea houses and restaurants, some of which were owned by Sherpa who were either part of the Everest expedition now, or have done one (and even several) before! Imagine talking to someone who climbed Everest 10 times or being able to visit a tent at Base Camp! All thanks to Narayan. Narayan was also very attentive and helpful in all situations, including when I got stomach sickness and had to spend one of the rest days in bed. Having him measure my oxygen was helpful because it confirmed that it was not altitude sickness. During the trek, I tried to follow Narayan as much as possible- he made trekking look so effortless, no matter at what altitude. Later on, when I would get very tired, he stayed back and walked with me. I cannot say enough good things about Narayan and express my gratitude for this experience. As for my brief stay in Kathmandu, the hotel was very comfortable, even though I was worried because in some of the trip advisor reviews people were not too happy. All I can say is that I was surprised how luxurious it was and I would definitely stay there again. Our city guide was Raju, a walking encyclopedia! He introduced us to the culture, religions, history, politics, etc. Raju was not only knowledgeable but also very charismatic and personable. He also has a great voice - made a great singer together with the driver, which to this moment represents one of the happiest memories from the trip. Overall, I cannot say enough good things about my experience with Nepal Eco Adventures. I wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone looking for an authentic experience of trekking in Nepal. Thank you to the entire Nepal Eco Adventure Team."

It was a spur of the moment decision-- 20% based on testimonials and 80% side-by-side comparison versus other companies.If I were to undergo the process all over again, I would look no further than the testimonials about this team. Surely, people will recognize the warm, personal, yet utterly professional approach that Chhatra, Ram, Santosh, the porters and even their drivers use.As we've experienced (you may refer to my wife, @patriciacpab 's posts), we were simply awed by the wonders of the entire trek despite the massive physical undertaking. And this is because NEA faciltiated everything smoothly. Some top strong points for NEA:> Chhatra's timely response to our first query. First impressions last.> NEA is very sincere with their recommendations, ie when to book your trip, the people you're going to be grouped with, why we shouldn't be anxious abut certain things... This speaks highly of the company's values.>Profile of their guides. I've met two of their lead guides, but I could only speak fully about RAM, the alpha-guide. His trekking skills are top-notch--from basic mountaineering to practical reasons such as when to take a shower. Ram is very reliable. Like NEA, Ram is sincere in ensuring that you feel safe and satisfied throughout the trek. Other trekking groups even consult him! This happened when one of the members of another group was suffering severe AMS-- good thing that Ram/NEA carries around their own oxymeter!>NEA maintains a good network among hotels and stops. You don't have to worry about missing a slot, or even missing a table.>NEA is a highly local company. We felt that in supporting NEA, a relatively small trekking company we were 100% supportive of the local economy. (Sure, they don't carry around reservation signs for our dinner table, but they make things happen!)Our EBC trek is the best, most out-of-this-world and exciting trip we've ever done and I just can't imagine taking NEA out of the equation."

            "review": "Awesome Annapurna Circuit. The Annapurna Circuit was an incredible and memorable trek organised by Nepal Eco Adventures: I chose a 18 day trek, which was actually around 14 days of walking from Besisahar to Ghorepani and then Nahyipul, 1 day acclimitisation in Manang, 1 full day in Pokhara and 2 days of travel (to and from Kathmandu). Our guide, Bam Magar, was phenomenal -- extremely knowledgeable about the different routes, very experienced (been a guide since the early 1990s), knew some really good places to eat and sleep, was very flexible, and was a good travel companion. Over the course of 14 days, I got to know quite a few of the guides, and Bam was definitely one of the best -- so would recommend asking for him (he also books groups privately).The route is very manageable and most days we would finish the days walking soon after lunch. Perhaps it would take an extra hour or two for a less fit group (so on average 5-6 hours/day, including stops for breaks and lunch). Our route was as follows:Day 01:Drive from Kathmandu to besisahar/Balbule (923m). -- VERY VERY long drive. lots of traffic, slow moving, took about 10 hours. Day 02:Trek to Jagat (1410m). -- Jagat is a beautiful town, but the walk here is not particularly exciting. I think Jagat or Syenge would be good starting placesDay 03:Trek to Dharapani (2160m).Day 04:Trek to Chame (2710m). -- beautiful locationDay 05:Trek to Upper Pisang (3240m). -- beautiful locationDay 06:Trek to Manang (3540m). -- recommend taking upper route, rather than the road.Day 07:Acclimatization day at Manang. -- must do walk to monastery, ice lake or Gangapurna glacier lake -- great viewsDay 08:Trek to Yak Kharka (4120m). --very short day, but necessary for acclimitisationDay 09:Trek to Thorung Phedi (4,560m). --very short day, but necessary for acclimitisationDay 10:Over Thorung La (5,416m) to Muktinath (3,802m). -- long tough day, but well worth it! I would recommend NOT staying in Muktinah, but rather walking to next town (20 minutes away) of Jharkot (much more rustic and interesting and less touristy). If you have the extra energy, can even do the 2-3 hour walk to Kagbeni!Day 11:Trek to Kagbeni (2840m). -- if you're on a tight schedule, can just walk through Kagbeni (to see the beautiful Mustang desert landscape) and stop in Marpha for the nightDay 12:Trek to Marpha(2670m) -- fantastic, must stay here! beautiful white lime-washed walled town.Day 13:Trek to kalopani(2530m) -- town has great mountain views, but town itself is dissapointing. Next town over Lede seemed less touristy and more beautiful.Day 14:Trek to Tatopani(1290m) Natural hot spring. -- I'm not that interested in concrete hot springs, next time will stay in smaller village.Day 15:Trek to Ghorepani (2750m). -- spectacular views from top of the hill (Superior Hill Hotel)Day 16:Early morning trek up to Poonhill and trek down to Nayapul then taxi to Pokhara. -- Great views from top of PoonhillDay 17: Pokahara -- worth spending an extra day here, drinking beer and relaxing by the lake.Day 18:Drive back to Kathmandu, transfer to hotel. -- VERY VERY long drive. lots of traffic, slow moving, took about 10 hours.I chose to go with a trekking company because I didn't want the hassle of organising transport, porters, accommodation, permits, food, etc. And Nepal Eco Adventures did a superb job, and I would recommend them to anyone. Retrospectively, it is relatively easy to organise these things, but it is still a pleasure to have everything sorted so efficiently by Nepal Eco Adventures. Chatra was also very helpful and quick in replying to emails, and very flexible with developing the itinerary. The company also gave the best value for money deal of any of the companies I explored.However, if you are a very fit/athletic person like me and experienced trekker, you may consider doing the route by yourself at your own pace, as it's very well marked trail and there are many places to eat and stay, and very safe. In this way you can adjust your route/walking distances as you feel fit. I would highly recommend the seamless experience provided by Nepal Eco Adventures for any standard trek in Nepal. But especially if you are NOT an experienced trekker, or don't have the fitness to do it alone, or don't want the hassles of organising any of the finer details!"

In addition to being patient (we were stopping all the time to take photos) Narayan was very observant, showing and telling us about wildlife and plants along the way and he knows a lot about the area and its history and culture. He is a very experienced guide as well as being calm, reliable and always in a good mood!We went on a six day trek from Syabrubesi to Kyanjin Gompa and a small peak just above the village. It was terrible to see the damage last year's earthquake had done in the valley, especially in Langtang, but everyone were working from early morning till nightfall to restore the the place. All the lodges we stayed at were very charming and the staff was always friendly and helpful, making us feel like home. We were very lucky with clear weather almost every day despite going trekking in the monsoon season, and I will absolutely recommend visiting this beautiful place with Nepal Eco Adventure. Having someone who takes care of everything; accommodation, meals, transport etc. is so comfortable, you won't have to do anything else than walk and enjoy the view!PS. Be prepared for a long and bumpy bus drive between Kathmandu and Syabrubesi, the view makes it worth it!"

They take care of everything for you (hire porters, take care of TIMS card, national park permit, book flights, sleeping bags, etc) and at a reasonable price! We were always in good hands with our guide Nir. Not only was he was very knowledgable and experienced guide, but also incredibly kind. When I was feeling some of the negative side effects of the altitude, he was always sure to check in on me and make me feel better.

            "review": "Great Local Company & Tour to Everest Base Camp. We recently returned from a private tour to Everest Base Camp with Nepal Eco Adventure. I decided to go through this company due to the great reviews on TripAdvisor. We also decided that doing a private tour would be a much better option than a big group tour - as we could be flexible with our trekking times and walk up to Everest Base Camp at our own pace.From the moment I contacted their office, Chhatra (manager) was very helpful and very flexible in planning our trek for us. He speaks wonderful English and looked after us very well. Our booking was made in 2015 before the earthquake in Nepal. Due to nerves, we asked if we could postpone our tour to 2016, which Chhatra had no problem in doing for us. We are very thankful for this. His prices and itineraries are very good and you'll find them a lot better value than a majority of the other bigger companies around.Upon arrival in Kathmandu, the airport is a crazy place and were glad that we had our own private transfer waiting for us. They took us to the office where we picked up our trekking gear and then headed to the Radisson (great accommodation in Nepal by the way) for a couple nights. It must be noted that Chhatra provided us with sleeping bags, duffle bags and trekking poles - which saved us buying our own. A nice touch from the company.The first part of the tour was a city tour around Nepal. Unfortunately, a lot of the city is still in the rebuild phase after the earthquake and while it is sad to see, it was a rather long day looking at the same sort of stuff. It probably could have been half the length that it was. Our guide for the day was ok, but he did seem more interested in taking phone calls than playing tour guide. The driver was fantastic though and I was still glad to have seen everything I did!When the time came to fly up to the mountains and start the trek, we were picked up from our hotel and really looked after by our guide, Ram (there's 2 Ram's at Nepal Eco Adventure - we had Big Ram). He checked us in and helped us with getting our luggage sorted. He also helped us get the best seats on the small plane so we could get the best views over the mountains as we flew into Lukla. His 20 years trekking experience really shows as he knows everybody and everyone is so glad to see his smiley face.For the whole trek, Ram was very patient with us. We were very slow walkers compared to most on the trails as we had never been at altitude before, so some of the days really took it out of us. But Ram never complained and always stayed a few feet in front to help us keep going. We never felt rushed and he always encouraged us to stop and take rests and photos.The accommodation that was chosen for us was always indoors in cosy little teahouses. While these are fairly basic hotels, the ones Ram chose for us were of very good quality compared to what other people were staying in. The toilets were mainly western style and the rooms were generally spacious enough with comfortable beds. I felt this was a much better option than going on a World Expeditions Tour - where they have to stay in tents and use outside toilets! I could only imagine how cold those poor people would be! The communal dining area in each teahouse was always warm in the evening when they started up the fire. The food at every stop is basically the same - loads of carbs (pizza, pasta, sandwiches, potatoes, etc.)! But in saying that, it is fantastic food and we never went hungry. You all need to try a Mars or Snickers roll when you go - AMAZING! The owners at each guesthouse were friendly and very accommodating. The scenery itself is what you'd expect in the Everest region - spectacular! Every day would bring new views, new mountains to see and amazing photo opportunities. The weather was great - sunny skies every day until about 2pm, and then the afternoon cloud would roll in and cool things down. While it did snow and the winds were cold, it was quite pleasant in the sun while we were trekking and by the time is cooled down, we were generally indoors anyway. Some days we braved very cold winds and cloud (about -15c), but if you're dressed appropriately, then it's fine.The trek itself is not for the faint-hearted. It is pretty tough going and there were times where we wanted to turn around and just go home. But everyone has these thoughts, and it is a mental game to make it all the way to Everest Base Camp. When you finally reach it though, you are glad you stuck it out and put in the massive effort to make it. It's a once in a lifetime experience that only very few can say they have achieved.One of the highlights of our trip was actually our porter - Rodna. He was a young, 26 year old Nepalese lad who grew up in the mountain region. He was so little and skinny, yet so strong as he carried both of our very heavy duffle bags each day. He worked so hard and we are so very thankful for all his hard work. We could tell he was very poor, but he always had a smile on his face and went out of his way to look after us. While he spoke very little English, we believe this brought an extra charm to his ways. He taught us card games, was always singing and never failed to bring us fresh fruit each night after dinner. I really hope Chhatra knows how valuable Rodna is to his team - a wonderful little porter!Overall, this was a fantastic trip that has memories that will stick with us for a lifetime. While it is tiring, it is definitely worth the effort to say you've made it to Base Camp and to see the wonderful sights of the Himalayas! We wouldn't have made it without our wonderful guide Ram and his little sidekick Rodna - thank you ever so much, boys! Chhatra's experience in trekking and running a business is wonderful and it was a pleasure dealing with him. Thanks for making our EBC dreams come true!If you're a bit worried about heading to Nepal after the Earthquake, don't be. While some older buildings and roads are still getting rebuilt in Kathmandu,the mountain region is fine and there are no signs of the earthquake even occurring. The danger of another earthquake has passed and you should feel safe knowing you're in the very capable hands of Nepal Eco Adventure!Thanks for the wonderful adventure!"

Chhatra was very helpful during the booking and pre trek stages of our trip, and during the trek we were extremely well looked after by our guide Ram. The whole team was very attentive, friendly and made it a trip to remember. Nothing but positive memories!"

Chhatra was approachable and easy to get answers from before and during my visit. Trekking solo, with a guide and porter allowed me to set my pace to my liking, as well as the start and finish time. My guide Shiva and porter Ram were attentive and pleasant. The experience was everything I hoped for. As I finished my trek 6 days early, I ended up organizing a sight seeing trip of Nepal on the fly, making it up as I go. Chhatra was immediately receptive, answering whatsapp messages, arranging drivers, hotels, flights, he made it all as easy for me as possible. I highly recommend Chhatra and Nepal Eco Adventure for any travel need in Nepal."

Incredible scenery in an amazing country, along with Chhatra and Nepal Eco Adventures really did give me an unforgettable trekking experience. When booking the trip online, I was naturally a bit reserved as the package sounded extremely reasonable and I assumed there would be some hidden costs. However, I was wrong as everything was seamlessly taken care of and included, from airport transfers to hotel bookings to trekking permits! Chhatra is a lovely man who truly takes care of his customers, and really does go out of his way to give them unforgettable experiences. When speaking to Chhatra about his philosophy, he realises that price in no longer the determining factor that Trekkers look for when booking treks and therefore strives to deliver exceptional experiences (although the price is still really good!). I can confirm his company did this and cannot recommend Nepal Eco Adventures more for Nepal trekking holidays."

My objective in Nepal was to go to Sindhupalchowk to see the true Nepal and to experience and document what life is like for those hardest affected by the earthquake. My translator, guide and now friend Raju was smart, knowledgable, kind, funny, courageous, reliable and indeed a great guide- but an even better person. My requests and destinations were by no means easy and accessible but Raju and Chattra did everything i could have ever wished for- and more in our attempts of getting there. Basically i could not have requested a more difficult task but with the help of Raju it was made overwhelmingly easy. Together me and Raju went to places very few ever go but in his company i couldn't have felt more comfortable. Nepal is a beautiful place with wonderful people and scenery and sharing them with a person as Raju added so much to an already incredible experience. Thank you so much for giving me an unforgettable time, i will stand by this agency as being the best in Asia for the rest of my life."

I travelled with two friends to Nepal in January and would highly recommend Nepal Eco Tours!Although January is not peak time to trek to Everest Base Camp, Chhatra was very enthusiastic for our trip and organised all the details with prompt emails - the process was very straight forward. He welcomed us to Nepal and is a very friendly guy. Nir was our guide for the trek and he was great. Knowledgable of the area and supportive when we had difficulties. He regularly checked our oxygen levels and heart rate to make sure we were acclimatising to the altitude. Our porter Mekman deserves a medal for carrying our gear!When one of our group fell ill, Nir and Chhatra were excellent at organising a helicopter back to Kathmandu and a hospital bed.We had great weather - very cold but sunny most days ensuring we got spectacular views. Also by trekking in January the route is fairly quiet so you feel you have it more to yourself but we still met great people to share the trip with.Our whole experience in Nepal was amazing. The Himalayas are incredible and I can't wait to return to the mountains. Our trip included a guided tour of Kathmandu which was fascinating and we enjoyed exploring vibrant Thamel.Trekking in Nepal is an incredible experience!! Go for it!"

I would highly recommend the Everest Base Camp trip with this company as they made sure we had the best accommodation and food throughout the whole trip. The porter we had was friendly as well. There were times when I felt worried about things due to altitude e.t.c and Ram made me feel I was in the right hands at all times. Not at any point did I fear for my safety. They use a heart and breathing monitoring device as well that most companies don't use which again makes you feel safer. Anyway you won't regret using the company take my word. I plan to use them again next year for the Annupurna Circuit. Thanks again Chhatra and Ram. See you soon."

Being my first solo trip for my 30th birthday, this was a big deal to me. As said in a lot of other reviews, Chhatra is very timely and thorough with his responses. before my arrival we only communicated via email however he answered every one of my plentiful questions and put my mind at ease especially since this was my first solo trip ever. I booked everything 1 week before and they were still able to accommodate me. It's nice how Chhatra comes to the hotel in Kathmandu to meet the guests and answer any other questions they may have and just have a good conversation. After our first meeting at the hotel He took me shopping to find a few things I needed, and that really made me feel comfortable and less anxious as I was a bit scared to go out alone. After that I was walking around Thamel like a local. The Nepali people are so lovely, kind, humble and smiley. My driver in Kathmandu - Shreehari - is so cool, he could totally run his own party bus and drive around Kathmandu playing awesome music, as we had done a few times. Raju my guide for the whole trip is amazing - very attentive, accommodating, knowledgeable, funny and kind. My porter Govinda is so sweet, always smiling and never complained about my incredibly heavy bag which he carried with absolute ease, while I'm struggling up the steps with my backpack weighing 500grams. The lodges we stayed at on the trek were on point, I paid for a single room and always had private facilities. My favourite place was Ghorepani, met some really cool locals there and had the best time ever. I am planning on doing a longer trek the same time next year with Nepal Eco Adventres. Nepal is such a beautiful country with beautiful people. My advice when travelling in general, have a open-mind, a positive attitude and ALWAYS make time for the locals.If you're in a group or travelling solo, don't hesitate. Book now!"

He was really funny, didn't bombard us with facts about flora and fauna and the politico-historical situation, he just let us ease into the trek. We were paired up with a couple who never stopped complaining for the first few days and they were really high maintenance but once they finished we were able to properly enjoy the views, the walking and the tea houses. Our porter initially was a puny 22 year old student who was too weak to carry our bags so we replaced him with a proper local Sherpa who did a great job. I'm so grateful to Nepal Eco Adventure for organising all the paperwork to do with the climbing permits, assigning us such a great guide and plotting out an achievable and stunning route for us to do. So many great sights and variety in scenery - it was honestly amazing and humbling."

Was not that keen on the Katmandue hotel was in a noisy area and the linen stank of smoke. Breakfast next day was good. The 6 hour bus ride to Pokhara was very unpleasant. We only took the bus as we believed from the company litreture that we needed to allimaitse to the altitude. Pokhara it's self is a much more relaxed place than Katmandue and the 2nd hotel the Third Pole was basic but clean with friendly helpful staff. Start of the trek went well until, we started to clime the hundreds of steps and our guide was keener on keeping up with another party than staying back with us. It was very obvious from the start that our pace was much slower but he still talked us in to completing all the steps in one day. Again keeping up with the other party. We could not keep up the pace and insisted the guide stay with us. The next 2 days were much more enjoyable as we slowed our pace and were able to take pictures and rest when we needed to. I expected the accomadation to be basic but it was more so than I had thought. We changed our plans on the way back and took a jeep which cut out 2 hours walking. Back at the Third pole hotel we got a room with a bath which was really appreciate. (Will review hotel separately) We flew back to Katmandue (prearranged) We declined to stay in the original Katmandue hotel and booked into the Hyatt. (Was worth every penny)ConclusionShould have done more homework my selve and not relied on company information (to general)Wish I took thermals and a hot water bottle. Annapurna mountain range and Rhodadendrum Forrest spectacular sights. I am glad I have seen them."

Coming from a flat, hot country we were not as prepared as we could have been for the walking involved.Our tips would be to:Take the internal flight from and to Kathmandu and refuse the bus.

The hotel choice is not good from Nepal Eco Adventures.Take a hot water bottle and get used to using a bucket at night. Take the sleeping bags offered and learn the Nepalise for slow down."

If you are considering a trek in Nepal and are based in Kathmandu, Eco Adventure Nepal should absolutely be first choice!Chhatra, the chap who will fill you in on everything about the trek that you are curious about, is an ex-guide and the business owner so knows his stuff! We turned up short of a few bits we required initially and were fitted up and supplied with the gear we lacked immediately at his office.We chose the Langtang Valley trek which begins in the Village of Syabru Bensi. Our guide, Nikhil Basnet (Nik) was excellent and more than willing to go over and above if needed! He sorted a more comfortable trip for us on the first leg (Kathmandu to Syabru Bensi). Which gave me some peace of mind considering my nervous disposition as a passenger on the road. We travelled by jeep instead of local bus at no extra cost.Each day we set off early and our meals were paid for breakfast, lunch and dinner as part of the initial cost. Each night we were given fresh fruit after dinner that Nik carried along the way in his bag. Along side this, a medical kit and phone for outside the mountainous region contact.We had chosen not to take a porter and carry our own kit.My friends and I struggled to keep the pace that Nik had. We are all in our early twenties and Nik is 10 years our senior. However, he caught on to our slow moving trekking and stuck either close in front or behind with us, letting us stop for a snack and drink when we were in need. We trekked to Mundu, the next village onward from Langtang around 3400m. All along the way Nik was very informative of the surrounding area and path we trekked. Being a former porter (since 14!) he is very aware of the landscape and knowledgable.Unfortunately one of our friends fell ill with a cross, we believe, between altitude sickness and potentially something he had eaten or had to drink.Nik was quick to act and without fuss called Chhatra who then called in an emergency Helicopter to transport us and our sick friend back to Kathmandu. A normally 3 day trip back to the city had only taken us 20 minutes by chopper. The Insurance covered this no problem (a must have and not to be scrimped on!).Previously on the trek we tried to reduce our backpack weight by leaving clothes and other items at various villages along the way. Nik made room in his pack and sacrificed his quick getaway to Kathmandu and made off down the hill to our stops before, collecting 6 different items scattered between villages, only to return them to our hostel in Kathmandu a day later!We were incredibly grateful.A couple of days later when our friend returned from the hospital Nik joined us for lunch for a chat and a Laugh.Chhatra even left his office too to visit our sick friend in the hospital and see how he was! Excellent experience, always more confidence inspiring when you have people who enjoy what they do and know what they're talking about.Neil."

We were blessed with clear sunny weather everyday which I didn't expect for winter. The views and sights were breathtaking!My guide Ram was a gentleman, he was diligent at taking care of all of my needs. He was very sociable and spoke perfect English, it felt like trekking with a friend. He is very fit so even though I felt like I was pushing my limits physically he always was able to stay with me. We were able to squeeze 2 days trekking into a day (from Gorak Shep to Namche Bazaar), just because I wanted to use wifi and have a hot shower.Many people consider doing the trek without a guide or porter to save money, although its possible, most people who I met were struggling carrying their bags, constantly counting their pennies and having to find accomodation. Sure, they will have some saved money but their experience seemed a lot more stressful. I would recommend paying a lump sum and not having to worry about anything. I had 3 decent meals a day during the trek and with Eco tours I felt I got the best room where ever I stayed.If you go trekking take some books and cards (the guides usually know some fun card games). As some days you will arrive as early as 1pm with a whole day to kill, but no TV or internet. My porter was also very kind and humble. I was able to have dinner at his house and meet his family during the trek which was a fascinating experience for me.I couldn't recommend Eco Tours enough. Thanks!"

I was ridiculous the amount of care, effort and time they put into me to make the trip as worthwhile as I had imagined it to be. Chaatra took time out of his schedule to meet me at the airport, make me feel comfortable and even took me to a place to purchase all of my trekking gear to avoid being ripped off. He even lent me his personal items so that I could minimise my spending and future carrying load (as I was going to continue travelling after the trek). It was so generous of him! Ra Ju took me on a tour of Kathmandu and taught me so much about religion and culture- he's such an awesome dude and is the reason why we still keep in contact today! I originally booked a tour with 3 others, who unfortunately cancelled last minute due to the fuel crisis (that how now ended) and last years devastating earthquake (which does not effect the trek at all).. this meant that it was just going to be me, my guide and my porter on this trek. I was a little bit uneasy as I didn't know if the guide and porter would be able to speak English and would be as festive as me over Christmas... After the 3rd day on the trek every single one of my fears and worries were overcome. My guide, Tshering - the coolest guy in town- and Pemba my porter - the happiest man to walk this earth- were the best company EVER! They took care of me and my fear of the dark, made sure I was comfortable every step of the way and altered the itinerary to suit my physical needs. They did this all in the goodness of their hearts! They spoke awesome english and had the best sense of humour which meant the 6 hours of downtime we had everyday felt like 1... We even met solo trekkers on the route who ended up trekking with us until the end. Tshering opened up his expertise to everyone that he met on the way and when I thought I was never going to make it over the pass, he stuck through with me in the blistering cold. I learnt enough Nepali to impress the locals and even learnt how to cook with them! It was just so amazing having Tshering and Pemba- they were so open to teaching me and the 3 boys that we met the ins and outs of Nepali culture and history! I really felt like a local! I went travelling solo for 5 months around Europe and Asia. People ask me what my favourite part was and without hesitation it would be the 18 days I spent on the mountain with Tshering, Pemba, Aaron, Sander and Jo (the 3 boys we met) all because of Chaatra from Nepal Eco Adventures. If you want to be seriously looked after at a personal level you would be absolutely kidding yourselves if you didn't book Nepal Eco Adventures. They're the most flexible, understanding and caring group of people you will ever meet. Will totally be back in the next year or so to do another with them. Come as strangers and leave as friends! Best. Time. Of . My . Life."

We felt going in December was the best time for the trek, since it was not peak season, so the trails were not very crowded. The weather was a little cold, but manageable and we had clear skies for the entire trek. The guide did a great job and helped us reach our goal. The trekking was not very difficult (around 4-5 hours a day) and the views are spectacular. Sun rise a Poon Hill and base camp were definitely the highlights of the trip."

From the very first moment I made contact with Chattra, I knew we would be in good hands.I had put together a brief of what I envisaged our family holiday to be, emailed several top tour operators (many recommended) and Chattra from Nepal Eco Adventure was the only one who was quick, responsive, professional, knowledgeable and experienced.We worked on an itinerary for a private tour, which later was changed following the Earthquake.Our trip took us on a mix of 'Nepalese flats\" (never believe a Nepalese flat) and cultural experiences. As we only had 10 days on the trek, we hiked part of the Annapurna circuit, starting at Pokhara (private jeep/bus to Tatopani) Walking from Tatopani through to Shikha - Ghorepani - Poon Hill - Tadapani - Ghandruk - Landruk - Phedi and back vehicle back to Pokhara.Life in the mountains is beautiful, basic, with warm hospitality and spectacular views. We loved every moment of the trek and although classed as an easy trek, there were many ups and downs which challenged our fitness. We were three people - my husband, 14 yo daughter and myself. We organised for a guide and two porters. Our wonderful guide Ram (although his real name is Jirel Hukum) was very experienced and he spoke very good English. Our trek was a holiday for him as he is used to getting up and down Everest Base Camp! He was respectful, warm with a gentle demeanour. He made us feel confident all the way. The two lovely porters were Santos and Mr G. The trio were a bubbly bunch when they got going in their native language or singing out loud their favourite beautiful Indian or Nepalese songs. My daughter, who was faster, enjoyed speeding ahead with the porters who looked after her and answered the endless questions.Our meal times took a while to get used to because they would ensure we were fed and settled before they ate anything. Even though we asked them to join us, very few times they did, as they sat with the 'family' our of respect.Our head porter, Santos, brought to our table a beautiful platter of slices of apple and pomegranate after every dinner. It was their way of saying good night. A lovely unexpected gesture, which was much appreciated and will be remembered.In a nutshell, our experience was wonderful and we would recommend Chattra and his crew to any of our family and friends wishing to have a similar adventure.I can't wait to come again and this time do the entire Annapurna Circuit!"

He not only understood what we wanted, but he was able to recommend some improvements to the trip that proved to be EXACTLY what we wanted. I could list all the times that Chhatra went above and beyond, but there were too many! He was always available, very communicative, knowledgeable and more than anything - willing to help.For the trek itself, Chhatra introduced us to Shiva, our guide. Shiva met us in KTM and took us all the way through the things that would have caused us dramas if we had been on our own i.e. flights (which can be a nightmare), permits etc.Shiva was a fantastic guide, he knew everyone! He was friendly, charismatic and engaging. There was never a dull moment around the fire at the end of the day! We were very lucky to be looked after by such a character. By the end of the trek, we were tired and sore, but thoroughly impressed with every aspect.I cannot recommend Nepal Eco Adventures enough. Chhatra and Shiva are two fantastic blokes."

(Honestly we dabbled with booking a US-based company but decided we liked the idea of supporting local business more.) We ended up picking the trek to Gokyo and hiked 12 days.Upon arriving to Kathmandu, Chhatra and his friendly driver met us with big smiles and got us to our hotel quickly - this was greatly appreciated after almost two days of flying. We were greeted with marigold flower necklaces too, which my wife definitely loved. The hotel selected by NEA was clean, centrally located and luckily equipped with a nice bathroom. Chhatra really put us at ease, we felt well prepared for the trek and he answered our endless questions with a smile. The day trips he arranged before and after the trek were lovely, it was great to get out of the \"touristy\" area and see other parts of town. I can't say enough about how professional and pleasant Chattra is to work with.Once we arrived in Lukla, we met our guide, Ram. My wife and I hit it off with Ram immediately, we are all around the same age (early 30s) and we ended up being the only two on the trek. Ram was such a great guide, he was patient with our questions and shared tons of trivia and information about the various mountains and history of the trek/Nepal. At night we often played card games ..where Ram beat us at numerous rounds of a local game ha. After a few days of trekking we all discussed our \"next trek\" and if we do venture back to Nepal, we would definitely book with NEA and request Ram."

Everyone was a pleasure to be with--friendly, helpful and welcoming. The trek over the Pass was a challenge, but the fact that we went higher gradually made it possible--even for a sixty something year old woman like me! The mountains and villages were amazing! It was cold (December) but most of the tea houses had a woodfire in the dining area. Food was really good--\"Dal bhat\" power! The fact that there were problems between India and Nepal (and a gasoline and propane shortage) did not affect the trip. We met other trekkers who did not have guides--including quite a few who were heading back the way they came because they didn't make it over the high pass--I wouldn't recommend going that route--especially when the weather can be questionable. We learned so much about the country from our guides. I'm looking forward to my next trek. This trip was really affordable--both the trek and the $650 plane ticket from LA to Kathmandu!"

I used Nepal Eco Adventure for Poon Hill trek and a trip with my family around Nepal.I had limited time for hiking so was looking for a 3-4 day hike in the Annapurna region. Poon hill trek was one of the top rated short hikes online. So, I contacted Nepal Eco Adventure regarding that hike and Chhatra got back to me the next day with a detailed itinerary. The cost was good and he took care of everything from right when I landed in Kathmandu - pick up from airport, hotel in Kathmandu, transport to Pokhara, food and accommodation during the hike, hiking permits, etc. It was nice to not have to worry about any of that during the trip. My guide, Ram was great. He was very friendly, accommodating and was happy to go at my pace. He made sure I got the best from the trip. The hike itself was great. The views from Gorepani and Poonhill were absolutely stunning. I had seen the pictures earlier; however, the views in person were surreal. We got lucky with the weather, it was completely clear.I also planned a trip with my family through Nepal Eco Adventure as well. After my hike I met up with my family in Pokhara. We stayed in Pokahara for a couple of days which was nice, then went to Chitwan National Park. This was the highlight of the trip with my family. Highly recommend canoeing in the river in the morning mist. Last part of our trip was cultural and architectural tour of Kathmandu. Our guide Durga was very knowledgable and friendly. Nepal Eco Adventure took care of everything - flights / buses between cities, accommodation, local tours. Again, not having to worry about any of that, made our trip easy and fun.I would highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventures for hiking or architectural / cultural tours. I'm already starting to plan my next trip - Everest Base Camp. Hopefully in 2017!"

I returned from Nepal just a month ago, having visited Kathmandu, Pokhara and Chitwan, and of course completing Everest Base Camp Trek with Kala Pathar. I initially only planned to do EBC and contacted Chhatra, the owner of Nepal Eco Adventure about, who immediately won my trust with his timely and knowledgeable answers. Thanks to this I also decided I wanted to to visit Chitwan and later Pokhara, which Nepal Eco Adventure arranged for me. Chhatra was very nice and obliging as my plans changed, making everything possible to realise them swiftly and smoothly. He also offered to provide down jackets, down sleeping bags, trekking poles and duffel bags to anyone in the group who didn't have any and did so free of charge - unlike most agencies who rent them. Of course, the highlight of the trip was the trek to Everest Base Camp, and I cannot thank enough my guide Ram, who was the best person you could hope to guide you through the mountains. He was always very informative about the places we visited and the peaks we were seeing as well as the local customs, and his English was fluent. The accommodations he chose for our group were the best we could hope for under the circumstances and he made sure everyone was comfortable. He advised us on food and made sure to check our oxygen levels twice a day. But the best part is, he was just fun to be around.:) I travelled as a part of an international group of six, with none of us knowing anyone in the group before, yet the group got along perfectly well and became friends. All of us reached EBC and summitted Kala Patthar. No one suffered from altitude sickness despite no one in the group taking Diamox, and I feel that this was at least partly thanks to the good care of our guide as well as the good acclimatisation routine we followed. Overall the EBC trip was a great success. The following visit to Chitwan was a nice contrast to the busy days on the trek. The jungle safari and the exposure to the Tharu culture were very nice, entertaining and relaxing. The resort we stayed at was also very nice, and our jungle guide was kind and knowledgeable. I also stayed in Pokhara for a couple of days, the second biggest city in Nepal, yet in many ways the complete opposite of Kathmandu. Chhatra helped arrange a trip to Sarangkot for me, but I also had plenty of time to wander on my own. I used the time to visit a Tibetan refugee camp by myself, where I met and talked with the Tibetans which was a very enriching experience. I also wandered around the lake, took a boat trip, visited the World Peace Pagoda as well as some local markets. Kathmandu was also nice, I had a personal city guide who took me around the city's landmarks. Again I had time to wander around on my own and very quickly felt right at home there. The best part was, that everywhere I went I met someone from my EBC trekking group. So even though I came to Nepal completely alone, everywhere I was with friends. If I visit Nepal again (which I plan to do), I would surely use Nepal Eco Adventure again. Happy holidays, Nepal Eco Adventure!"

Our trek was pretty remote and we had to have a guide, which was part of the permit deal, unlike Everest base camp and Annapurna treks. Our guide Pemba a local of the area, was brilliant, telling us about the local culture, and supportive, keeping us right, especially above the 4000m mark. The teahouses were pretty decent considering where we were. The chosen tea houses appeared to be the best in each village. And all under 4000m had really decent options other that just dal baht.There were very few fellow trekkers on this trek (and not WiFi or phone coverage) which was pretty magic. However all of them appeared to have significantly more for their trips than us. Word of advice go with a reputable Nepalese company. All the European, UK, US and Aus/NZ companies outsource to them but charge you thousands extra for the privilege!"

First we went to Chitwan, where we had two night safari package, and we enjoyed it a lot. The hotel was nice and our guide for the jungle treks was incredible. Only a small minus comes from the misunderstood of the elephant ride; I didn't want to take the elephant safari because of the bad reputation of those (all over the world, not precisely in Nepal) and we had asked for a jeep safari. They didn't know this in forehand at the hotel, but they managed to book us to the jeep safari instead of the elephant safari for extra money. So everything sorted out and the jeep safari was excellent!Then we had the ABC trek. We decided to finish the trek in 9 days, if something doesn't (sickness, injuries) come to our way. Our guide was Raju, who took very good care of us. Special thanks also to our porter, who also took care of us and asked how we feel etc during the trek, despite his limited English :)All of the tea houses and meals were better than we expected, and Nepal Eco Adventures offered fruits for dessert, which was a nice extra!Overall everything worked out really well and we were satisfied. All the people in Nepal who we met were incredibly nice to us, no hassle or anything and we felt very welcome, all the time. Highly recommending Nepal Eco Adventures and Nepal!"

My guide, Thakur, was excellent. With over 25 years guiding people round Nepal, there is nothing he does not know about the country and he knew every step of the Ghorepani Poonhill Trek. He paced the trek ideally for my fitness level and knew every stop for the best possible photos. His choice of stops for food were well placed, the food was great and the accommodation for every night was better than I expected for the middle of the mountains. Well known and respected by his many friends and colleagues, I would trek again with Thakur any time.In summary, this was the trip of a lifetime.

From arrival to airport in Kathmandu until our departure, we felt completely serviced both by our guide, and by Chhatra (monitoring us from NEA's headquarters ).NEA provided us with a great and experienced guide, something that became very apparent when we compared with various other groups along the way. The difference in experience and professionalism was palpable compared to other outfits. Our guide verified our oxygen levels regularly, modified our diets for maximum calorie intake despite lack of appetite at higher altitudes, and provided lots of colorful stories along our trek. We felt we were trekking with long time friends. Their choice of tea houses was also very good- something you come to appreciate very quickly. They did not cut corners and it showed. At the end of the day, the real value of an outfitter comes when you hit a snag. And sure enough, when we did, Chhatra and our guide Nirs did everything right so that we had a safe and terrific experience. I would feel totally comfortable sending my children to Chhatra and his team. My only advice to trekkers, take NAE advice- if they say to take a few more days to your schedule, DO IT. Adding a few more slack days to your schedule so that you have the flexibility to adjust your calendar to the inevitable snags you are bound to hit will make a huge difference to your experience. Running tight on days is unnecessary when you come from such a long way. Thank you NEA, and hope to be back in the coming years."

The lodges and teahouses I stayed in supplied me with a room with a bed and shared bathroom facilities, with the exception of Namche- where we stayed in a place that gave me my own bathroom (it was heaven!). If you decide to go with Nepal Eco Adventure, rest assured, you will be looked after very well. I can't wait to come back to Nepal and complete another trek with them."

We selected Nepal Eco Adventure as they gave us competitive package and excellent service right from first contact over email. Chhatra who runs the company is very prompt, knowledgeable, accommodating and has excellent staff. His knowledge and advise on EBC trek helped us to finalize this beautiful trek in very short time. The guide (Kumar), porters and all the arrangements through out our trek were very good. Kumar was very friendly and even played cricket with my young boys. He made sure we are comfortable and taken care off. The tea houses arranged by Chhatra/Kumar during the entire trek (Namche Bazar, Tengboche, Lukla) were very comfortable, well located, neat and clean with good food and service. I would highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure for trekking in Nepal."

The tea houses chosen by Shiva were decent, as clean as they can be in the situation. No trouble with food whatsoever. Always plentiful and delicious. Kala Patthar, Cho La pass and Gokyo Ri were not easy but the challenge was made welcome by these guys.

The tour options available were extensive but well thought through and planned. Chhatra was quick to reply, gave excellent advice (we decided on a cultural tour, with a mountain stay, sunrise/sunset trip and lots of history) and guidance and was a pleasure to meet in person when we arrived. The price was very reasonable as well and it was good to have everything clearly included/not included. Our guide and driver were faultless. They gave us the opportunity to tailor the trip how we wanted, were faultless in terms of knowledge, skills and enthusiasm and most importantly were a real advocate and insight into Nepalese culture, society and history. They were both such an asset to Nepal Eco Adventure - it was sad to say goodbye to them! We are often travellers who 'diy-it', but we wanted to take the stress out of it for our honeymoon and we were so overwhelmed by the educational, relaxing and mesmerising experience we had, all thanks to Nepal Eco Adventure. 5 stars doesn't seem enough! All I can say is thank you so much and we would do nothing but recommend them for your trip(s) in Nepal."

Kumar, my guide for the trek, had a good level of English, and made sure that I had the best experience on the trek. He is a really caring guide and throughout 3 weeks treated me like his little sister. He shown a great level of flexibility as well. When I had an idea to opt out for Tilicho lake we worked on the alternative route to sqiz it in without affecting safety (we still had to accent slowly due to risk of AMS). As well we did all the possible side treks to avoid the road which made an experience even better. The lodges included in the package were quite good and offered wide variety of food.The views on trek were breathtaking and I really hope to come back soon to discover Everest region.Overall I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure as a company of great professionals and people.Thank you, Guys for this unforgettable experience!!!"

Chhatra has excellent English so there was no language barrier, and he was able arrange English speaking guides to explain the intricacies surrounding the historic sites that we visited in Kathmandu.Once on the trek, the guides were superb. Very patient, loyal, funny, and knowledgable about the areas we were passing through. Their English was also very good and they always took the time to point out interesting features and were very attentive to see how we were all coping with the altitude. They were also integral to offering advice about getting wifi, hot water and decent toilets where necessary. Our blood oxygen was measured daily to ensure that we were all managing the altitude. All the guides were aware of health and safety and were able to break the group, or alter the speed, in order that everyone could achieve the trekking stage. Very quickly they became not just guides, but our friends. The weather forced us to alter our plans three quarters of the way through the trek, and this was accommodated by Chhatra and his team with minimal fuss, and they were able to arrange an alternative plan very quickly. From historic sites, to mountain trekking and safaris, Chhatra and his agency were able to devise an itinerary to suit our wishes. They really made Nepal accessible and provided the best opportunities to see a truly beautiful country. I would highly recommend them to anyone considering a trip to Nepal."

I am currently looking forward to coming back, as 4 days in this magnificent country are not nearly enough. When I do come back, Nepal Eco Adventure and Nir will be my first choice. Although they have been in business for roughly 2 years, both Nir and Chhatra boast a combined 35+ years experience giving tour guides. I can't wait to see them and their majestic country again.

We are now inspired to train for the Everest Base Camp trek in 2016! On a side note, Nepal is as enchanting as it ever was.

I decided to initiate correspondence with them and this is when the excellent experience I had with them began. Chhatra, who is the owner of the company, always responded to my emails in a timely fashion. If I emailed in the evening I would usually have a response by the next morning. This worked well for me as there is a 11hr45 minute time change from where I live. I quickly gained confidence in Chhatra as he answered my many questions and made recommendations to me. When I arrived in Katmandu all of my expectations and needs were met or exceeded. I was met at the airport by a driver and an English speaking guide who took me to my hotel. The next day I had a tour of Katmandu by the same guide, which included seeing a lot of temples, shrines, and palaces. Chhatra picked all of the hotels I stayed in which I found very comfortable and nicer than I expected.All of my trip was customized just for me. I trekked the complete Annapurna Circuit with just myself and a guide [Pemba Sherpa] that Chhatra assigned to me. Pemba is not only a very good guide, always looking after my needs, but a great guy. He was my friend, companion, and also my cultural liaison. He told me about sites, history, mountains, time to next teahouse [which proved to be quite accurate] and life in general in Nepal. He also knew that route so well that we could take alternative trails thus avoiding roads in the area almost entirely. All of this proved invaluable and I had a fantastic trip. I often travel, hike, sail, by myself, but Pemba provided a great value added. I'd use a guide again.After trekking I visited Chitwan National Park which proved to be a relaxing change of pace and allowed me to experience other aspects of Nepal such as elephants, rhinos, crocodiles, and beautiful birds I had never seen before. There are also about 200 tigers in the park, but I never saw any of them.In summary, I found the Nepalese people very friendly, and I met many guides and porters along my route who became my friends and I believe were competent, but the main reason I would recommend Nepal Eco Adventure is that their organization and advice made it very easy for me to have a great trip without knowing much about Nepal beforehand."

Firstly I would like to say that Chhatra (The Managing Director) is a very patient and understanding person who tirelessly attended to my numerous inquiry emails and the subsequent changes I had to make to the itinerary when my travelling companion pulled out. Arriving to Nepal alone and doubtful, I was thankful that he faithfully waited nearly 3 hours for me outside the airport, due to baggage delays, and was still very cheerful about it and pleased to meet me. I did a 27 day trip (ABC + EBC treks) and Chhatra customized the itinerary for me to minimize any unnecessary costs and allowed me to transit hassle-free and seamlessly between treks all the way to my return flight back to Singapore. When the earthquake slightly damaged the original hotel included in my package, he upgraded me to a better hotel without additional charge! Trek-wise, my guide, Narayan Rai, had a very good command of English and was very friendly and caring, treating me like his little brother. He would go out of his way to explain to me facts about the mountains and villages along the way. He also plucked berries and various fruits from trees for me to eat and always tried to ensure that I got the best room in the guesthouse. In addition, he was totally flexible in changing the itinerary based on my needs and wants on any particular day and made my trip unique and memorable. Though I was alone for this whole period, but my needs and safety were always taken care of and I never felt lost or abandoned in any way. So now that I am back safely and happily in Singapore, I would like to thank Nepal Eco Adventures for orchestrating such a pleasant experience for me =) I recommend that you try and speak with Chhatra should you ever think of coming to Nepal on vacation, you will not regret it."

There was 13 in our group and we had 3 fabulous guides plus Chhatra who gave us their undivided attention. My husband and I were usually at the back of the group and Santosh, one of the guides, stayed with us all the time, he didn't rush us or make us feel uncomfortable, we passed others, who, when the last members of their group arrived, set off again, meaning that the people at the back never had chance to recover. When we arrived at our hotels and joined the rest of our group, they all encouraged and supported us and didn't make us feel as though we were holding them back, we couldn't have asked for more and we successfully arrived at base camp and achieved our objective. On the last day of our holiday, when the rest of our group flew home, we experienced the earthquake and even though we were still having aftershocks and just a couple of hours after the quake, Chhatra came to our hotel to check that we were safe and after we had spent a sleepless night, he was on the phone at 5.00am keeping us informed of our flight details and turning up at 8.00am to check we were still fine and arranging a car to take us to the airport. Nothing was too much trouble and our safety was his priority.I would advise anyone thinking of visiting Nepal to make sure they speak to Chhatra, he will make your holiday one you will never forget and when we visit Nepal again this is something we will certainly do."

Our Guide, Chhatra and his team couldn't have done any more for us, ensuring that we were well informed of each day's itinerary and well looked after like family. All arrangements from flights, accommodation and food were well organised. Specific detail was taken to health and safety, acclimatising accordingly and everyone's oxygen saturation's were taken twice daily. Chattra is very knowledgeable about his Country and culture. He is always happy to answer any questions and is extremely friendly as is his porters. We built up a really good relationship with the guides. I would highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure to anyone whether it be your first trek or a return trek. I know I certainly will be returning some day. You will not be disappointed using Nepal Eco Adventure. Nepal is an absolutely stunning country and the views take your breath away. There is something very special about Nepal and the Nepalese people. I cried when I saw Everest. We also spent time in Kathmandu and Chitwan so experienced another part of Nepal. Chattra and his team made my trip one to remember for the rest of my life......one I will never forget."

We were most impressed with his speedy, informative and helpful emails. We wondered if he ever slept as it seemed no matter what time we emailed him we had a prompt reply.We were met the moment we exited airport customs and were very well taken care of every moment of the way by Chhatra and his team during our time. Our first nights were in a nice hotel within a short walking distance to Chhatra's office and we met Chhatra and our guide, Kumar, several times as we fine tuned our prep and plans for our Annapurna Panorama trek. Kumar picked us up on the morning we set off for Pokhara and was by our side for our entire travels and trek, taking care of all arrangements for bus and taxi travel, hotel in Pokhara and for our trek including all meals and guesthouses. We found the hotel in Pokhara to be first rate and each of the guesthouses along the trek were very suitable to our needs. The menus at the guesthouses were pretty standard and offered a reasonable variety of hearty, home made and most often delicious food served in large portions. Personal favourites included Dal Bhat, moo moos, the soups and awesome wood fired pizza.Kumar was an excellent guide and his English served us well. He had a quiet disposition, a great sense of humour and was very knowledgeable, informative and professional. He kept a close eye on us and set a varied pace to match our speed that was never hurried, allowed for many photos and other stops and yet always got us to the next guesthouse in good time. It was very evident that our safety was always Kumar's first priority and his diligence and caution served us well when the first earthquake tremor and the many follow-ups occurred. Always under Kumar's watchful eye, we safely completed the last three days of the trek back to Pokhara.The trek route itself was very enjoyable and not too taxing to a moderate level. The sunrise at Poon Hill on day three was so incredible as to make it all very worthwhile. Because of the earthquake we were unable to complete the safari.When we arrived back in Kathmandu after completing the trek Chhatra was there to meet us and take us to a room he had secured at one of the few operating hotels in the Thamel District. He was constantly in touch by phone and in person with us over the next several days as we worked to secure new flights home. Whether it was 8 in the morning or 930 at night he was there for us and other of his clients who were at the same hotel. Despite the pressures that the earthquake must have brought him and his family, Chhatra provided my daughter and me with an incredible level of service and support during those challenging days for everyone. From first contact to our goodbye, our experience with Chhatra and his team were first rate. Everything was as we expected and we found Chhatra to be very professional and trustworthy. We were left with no concerns or complaints whatsoever.As Nepal and Chhatra and his team all recover from the earthquake tragedy, we would very much encourage people who are interested in any of his treks, safaris etc to contact Chhatra to plan future visits. I am confident that Chhatra will give an honest assessment of each region's recovery and guide you to a most enjoyable and memorable experience in beautiful Nepal. We will definitely return as soon as we can."

We had to improvise quite a bit due to weather conditions, but every circumstance we met was solved rapidly. For example, the second part of our trekking we were taken to Langtang as we could not proceed on the Manaslu circuit.Traveled as a single female, never felt unsafe or unpleasant.Thanks team at Eco Adventure for the excellent trek and great time.

We used Nepal Eco Adventures for our entire private trip to Nepal which included an 8 day trek in the Everest region, sightseeing in Kathmandu and a Safari in Chitwan National Park. I can only agree with other comments. Chhatra did a great job of promptly answering all my e mails, addressing any questions or concerns, and organizing every detail in a professional manner. All the arrangements made were done precisely to what had been agreed upon and all transactions were handled professionally. If Chhatra is the brains of the organization, then Nir, our guide, is the heart and soul! Nir won us over from the first moment we met, with his enchanting smile, excellent English and engaging personality. On our trek he took especially good care of us and accommodated our needs, modified plans without any problems, when things did not go exactly as planned (my husband got the flu). We loved the many details that Nepal Eco Adventures attended to, that ensured our comfort and safety especially the fact that Nir had a pocket pulse oximeter to monitor for altitude sickness which is important when hiking at high altitudes. Overall a terrific experience I would recommend this company to anyone traveling in Nepal."

I initially signed up for the 17 day Annapurna Circuit in February '15 but finished 4 days ahead of schedule, this was never a problem and suited me as I wished to spend more time in certain areas - Tatopani and Pokhara. I received regular updates from Chhatra and quick responses to any questions I had from booking to completing the trek. Specialist equipment such as sleeping bag, down jacket and walking poles were also supplied with no additional cost. My guide Nik was fantastic had loads of experience, so much fun and I felt like I was treated as a King throughout my trek. Most importantly though when I had really awful symptoms of altitude sickness (feeling like death approaching), with Nik's experience, reassurance and the kindness of the tea lodge hosts I survived and still completed the circuit (if it wasn't for them, I would probably not have completed the circuit). I would thoroughly recommend this company to anybody who has not done any trekking before (like myself) or just wants a more care free approach to trekking as all your worries are in the very capable hands of Nepal Eco Adventure. Only recommendation the hotel you stay in at Pokhara - lovely but please not on the 5th floor I have had enough steps for the rest of my life after Ghorepani. Thank you very much for such a brilliant trek and adventure in Nepal."

Our initial inquiries were promptly and thoroughly answered by Chhatra, and in the end we booked our trek for an excellent price on the precise dates we wanted with all the extra equipment we didn't have included in the price (jackets, sleeping bags and trekking poles). We had a bit of a problem getting to Nepal (a Turkish Airlines aircraft had been damaged on landing at Kathmandu, closing the airport for 4 days), but Chhatra maintained constant email contact with us on the situation, and in the end we managed to depart on our trek only one day late. Our guide, Jiba, and our porters were truly outstanding. Jiba spoke excellent English (and good German, too!) and our helpers went above and beyond their duty to make sure we were comfortable, well-fed and happy throughout the trek. Alas, deep snow prevented us from making it through the Larke pass, but the views need Lau and Samagaun were still stunningly beautiful. Nevertheless, Chhatra treated us to a wonderful dinner out in Kathmandu to make up for not completing our circuit--a very generous and kind gesture that we all appreciated. Chhatra also arranged several day tours in and around Kathmandu at very reasonable prices. All in all, I have trekked in the Alps, the Andes and the Rockies, and this was absolutely the best experience I've had with a trekking agency. Highly recommended."

When I was planning my adventure to Nepal, Chhatra was fantastic. Great at replying quickly, professionally and totally flexible with regards to planning the trek. Our guide Ram was also fantastic, he knew the routes very well, shared all of his knowledge and experience. He was also funny and would hang out with us every night, playing card games etc. Also our porters were equally great, even with their low level of English they tried their hardest to communicate and be part of the group. The only bad thing was flying to and from Kathmandu - Lukla. We had a two day wait on the way out and a three day wait on the way home. I only just made my international flight the following day! The company I flew with was called Goma Air. They are by far the worst company, aviation and otherwise I have ever encountered. On the way back to Kathmandu, we had tickets from the company but they had no record of us on the flight manifest... I would 100% recommend not flying with them if possible!! This however, was no fault of Nepal Eco Adventure, Chhatra tried his hardest to help us throughout. Without his help I imagine I would still be stuck in Lukla 4 months later!! The trek itself (Everest Base camp with one pass) was such a positive challenge. One of the hardest physically and mentally challenging things I have done but so worth every ounce of effort! The scenery cannot really be described in words, amazing, and you meet some awesome people during your travels there. To summarize, Nepal Eco Adventure was great. Chhatra, our guide Ram and our porters were all fantastic. It is diffidently one of the more affordable companies but does not lack in quality services. Do not fly Goma Air!! With the exception of that.... AMAZING !! Thanks to all at Nepal Eco Adventure :)"

I contacted Chhatra and he was professional, knowledgeable, and very quick to respond. He was able to accommodate our group for the dates we wanted at a great price, and was able to advise on logistics and gear. All safety concerns were addressed beforehand, so we arrived in Nepal ready for an amazing adventure.Throughout the trek, the guides and porters were incredible. They made sure we were all well fed and had everything we needed for a great trip. I had the unfortunate situation of becoming sick early on in the trek. I had terrible gastric issues followed by symptoms of acute mountain sickness and, in the end, needed to be heli-rescued from the Everest region (Note: this is rare- so don't let that deter you!). The guides Ramesh and Nik monitored me the whole time and put my wellness as their priority. I was taken to a hospital in Kathmandu where Ramesh and Chhatra checked in with me regularly and made sure I was okay. After I recovered in hospital, I now had a few days free, so Chhatra helped me arrange a side trip with Ramesh to Pokhara and Australian Camp to view the Annapurna Mountain Range at sunrise. All to say, the care and consideration from Chhatra and his team were there the entire time I was in Nepal, and they made sure my trip would be a memorable one despite having to cut the trek short.If you're looking for prompt and attentive correspondence; very experienced and personable guides; and a team with a high level of service who makes your health and safety their main priority, then I definitely recommend booking with Nepal Eco Adventure. You will not be disappointed."

The walk itself was phenomenal, there aren't enough adjectives to describe how beautiful it is up there!

The trek itself was absolutely amazing (one that anyone who enjoys getting out in the wilderness should definitely consider doing this in their lifetime). I am very satisfied that I booked this through Nepal Eco Adventure. The owner - Chhatra - is a wonderful human being. Throughout my entire time in Nepal (one month) I visited Chhatra multiple times, choosing to use him for other adventures (Chitwan, Pokhara) after completing the trek. I'll try and summarize the reasons I would recommend Nepal Eco Adventure to others: Safety: Chhatra was always prompt in replying to any emails I sent him and incredibly helpful with all my questions and concerns. Chhatra connected us with a guide who has extensive knowledge of Sagarmatha National Park (has summited 6000m+ peaks, 16 years experience guiding, etc.) and provided an Blood-Oxygen Saturation Meter for us to help alleviate any concerns we had with AMS or our safety in general. I always felt that we were safe throughout the trek. Hospitality: Chhatra picked me up/dropped me off from the airport (saving me from the throngs of eager taxi drivers when I arrived around midnight) and ensured I got checked into my hotel after hours. Whenever I visited his office, he always had time to talk with me about my questions, experiences about the places I visited/planned to visit in Nepal, offering suggestions and recommendations. His english is very good, he's personable and it was easy to talk to him.Value:There are many trekking companies that head to EBC and they range in cost and quality. I was very happy with all that Nepal Eco Adventure offered for the price. They even go the extra step in providing down jackets, sleeping bags and trekking poles for those that need them.I can't wait for the chance to travel back to Nepal. Thanks again to Nepal Eco Adventure for making it such a special experience. I hope to see you again in the future."

My friend and I contacted Chhatra from Australia and he did a fantastic job organising our itinerary to fit in with our travel plans. From the moment we landed in Kathmandu, we were well looked after by Chhatra. He not only sorted our accommodation in Kathmandu, but set about organising an amazing trek to Langtang National Park and Gosaikunda Lakes. He introduced us to our guide and porter Dawa and Irra, who were to become good friends by the end of our two weeks together (and fierce competitors in card games- Dhumbal)! We saw the most amazing scenery everyday, but it was really the Nepali people who made our trip so special. Thank you to Dawa for being the ever social 'Red Panda' and introducing us to so many people on our walks. Thank you to Irra who not only carried our bags, but patiently taught us some Nepalese language along the way. Chhatra did an amazing job in organising our trek, and we look forward to returning to Nepal for another trek with Nepal Eco Adventure in the future. For anyone travelling to Langtang, you will read in Lonely planet about the long bus trip (9hr) to travel 120km. They are not kidding. We caught the public bus to Syabrubesi to start our trek, which took over 9 hours with a lot of bumps and upset tummies along the way. For the way home from Dhunche we opted to pay the extra money for a jeep which took about 4.5hrs. Thanks to Dawa and Chhatra for organising this, it is well worth spending the money. The cost of a jeep is 10 000 Rupees and comfortably seats 7 people + driver. We found many travellers willing to share the cost of the jeep. We highly recommend this, as the public bus is over-crowded with people, goats and chickens; and is subject to many stops by the local police/military for some time as bags are searched. Nepal is an amazing country, I am already looking forward to my next trip."

            "review": "Amazing Trek!. My sister and I completed the Annapurna Circuit using Nepal Eco Adventure after reading all the reviews on Chhatra and his company. Like so many others, I found Chhatra extremely responsive, friendly and knowledgeable. He patiently answered all questions both via email before arrival and in his office before and after the trek. He also provided a great set of walking sticks as my sister hadn't brought her own.On the trail, our guide was Ramesh and I can't say enough great things about him. He's worked as a guide for 15 years and his experience shows. His knowledge, patience and kind demeanour were all so much appreciated. I always felt very safe as a female traveller and he was an excellent sport when asked for \"protection\" from the odd goat, buffalo or spider! He was also happy to talk as we trekked but provided plenty of space for us to do our own thing.One thing of particular value was that we were permitted to customise our trip once on the trail. Upon getting to Jomson after all the days of peaceful trekking, it became clear that walking on the hot, dusty road was not going to be much fun. I proposed hopping the bus to Tatopani and instead spending those days trekking in the Annapurna Sanctuary - and that was what Ramesh ensured we did. That level of flexibility just made the trip and ensured we enjoyed our whole time on the trail.Lastly, our porter was well equipped for the trail, personally known to Chhatra and compensated properly which was important to us.I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure, Chhatra and Ramesh - all contributed to an amazing first time trekker's experience and I will be travelling with them again when returning to trek Everest in years to come.Tip: When you arrive at the airport you will be swarmed by men trying to carry your bags. Resist! Your guide and driver will take of you and you will avoid dealing with an aggressive group looking for outrageous tips.  "

            "review": "An excellent trekking agency. I had a great experience with Nepal Eco Adventures, trekking to Everest Base Camp and the Gokyo Lakes (with two additional days sightseeing in Kathmandu and Bhaktapur), and enjoying a wildlife safari in the Chitwan National Park.With so many other tour agencies in Kathmandu, it is difficult to choose who to go with, but I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventures.Chhatra is extremely welcoming, trustworthy, and well-organised. He was very attentive and always full of good humour. From his introductory email to my last few hours in Kathmandu, Chhatra answered every question promptly and in good detail, going out of his way to provide the smoothest experience possible. Chhatra provides a personalised and friendly service that's excellent value for money. I wouldn't hesitate to use his company again or recommend it to others.Truly, the Everest Base Camp and Gokyo Lakes trek was one of the best experiences of my life. Our guide was Ram who was brilliant throughout; easy-going, very friendly, always ready to joke and laugh, but professional, very hardworking, reassuring and encouraging too. He answered our every question about the trek, about life in the mountains and Nepali culture, and was always at hand with facts about the Himalayas and its many mountains. Having never been on a trek before, I was glad we had Ram to guide us. We had no worries, just time to enjoy the beautiful views.Having spent hours researching this trek online, I am surprised that so many other groups trek to Gokyo first, before crossing the Cho La Pass to base camp. I'm glad Eco Adventures took the eastern route first. Not only is the route a safer choice for altitude acclimatisation, the scenery ascending to base camp via Tengboche and Dingboche is far more spectacular. It also makes crossing the challenging Cho La Pass more manageable, going down the steep western side rather than struggling up it. The scenery going down from Gokyo was beautiful too, but less dramatic, and the journey down takes less time than going up. I was glad to spend more time dwarfed by the snow-capped mountains.I'm a person of average fitness, but believe most people would enjoy this trek. There is no pressure to go beyond your ability, just take your time and enjoy. Do it and you will not regret it!"

He has excellent leadership and organisation skills, excellent English and is fun to be with. Chhatra took our group on a sightseeing trip around Kathmandu, 6 day trek from Jiri to Junbesi (the original Everest route), helicopter flight back to Jiri, white water rafting, elephant safari where we saw rhino, crocodile spotting in dugout canoes and exotic bird watching in the jungle of Chitwan National Park. As if that wasn't enough to pack into 2 weeks, we ended with an early morning unforgettable sightseeing flight to Everest from Kathmandu.Chhatra organised all accommodation, food, transfers etc. On his treks he uses well equipped porters all personally known to him who are paid more generously than many of the workers from other trekking companies. I have no hesitation on recommending Chhatra as a competent, knowledgeable and friendly individual who ensures you have a positive experience travelling in the amazing country of Nepal."

Months prior to my trip, we coordinated with one another via email. As I never had been to Nepal, I was a bit skeptical and we got pestered at the airport and our hotel hosts were not exactly the most accommodating. When I met Chhatra, I could not help to feel skeptical and felt a little scared given my experience already in Kathmandu. I was NEVER more wrong!!! He turned out to be the best surprise of our trip. He was friendly, engaging, honest, helpful, and kind. Not only that, he went out of his way to help us after our trek to Annapurna. This guy is incredible. He gave us everything we wanted. He made us feel comfortable, supported, engaged, and most of all excited about our trip. We are hoping some day to return as I keep telling my significant other I want to return. I can guarantee you that we will be looking up Chhatra and his company to help us with our trek needs. You won't be sorry!!!"

For some reason, those two things go hand-in-hand. Everyone always asks me,\"Where was the best place you've ever traveled?\" I have a few places that will remain close to my heart, and Nepal is absolutely on that list. People then ask, \"Why?\" Well, it's easy to say that Nepal is serenely beautiful and there is just something very special about the way this place made me feel. But I've learned from my travels that my 'favorite' places were better judged by the company I shared the experience with. Positive energy is something you cannot 'pay' for, but greatly enriches your experience.

Chhatra, the owner of the company, was very helpful in helping me organise the trek, making sure I had all the right gear before the trek and was a great friend too after the trek. He's actually the nicest, funniest most generous person ever. My guide was Siva who was also fantastic. It was just him and I and he always made sure I was feeling good and made sure I was included in conversations with local peoples and teahouse owners. Siva also taught me lot's of Nepalese language and taught me lot's about the culture, history and surrounding mountains which I would not have learnt had I not been with him and greatly enhanced my trekking experience. I did the Annapurna Circuit Trek, walking the entire way from Besisahar to Nayapul. Siva was very flexible and let me set the pace (walk more or less) in a day so we weren't tied to the itinerary. I was always happy with the accommodation choices Siva chose for us and he obviously knew where the best local lunch spots were!I felt very safe at all times (safety was a concern of my parents because I was a young female travelling alone) because of Siva and Chhatra's professionalism, trekking experience, loyalty and kindness. I felt the price was excellent value for the hospitality, guide service, food, accommodation, transport and the whole experience I received. I did not feel like a 'customer', but was treated like a guest and friend. I would definitely recommend Chhatra and his company Nepal Eco Adventure Treks to any person or group looking to go trekking in Nepal and I will definitely go with Nepal Eco Adventure again."

He also offered great advice based on our preferences. Chhatra sorted out our internal flights to Pokhara and even booked us an early morning Everest scenic flight. When the flight didn't take off, he assisted in us getting all the money back quickly and efficiently. During the trek itself, Chhatra was our guide. He was great to be around and really helped us get a good understanding of the local culture and customs in the villages we stayed in. I really did get so much out of our holiday and for that I must thank Chhatra and his insight and advice.I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure if you are looking for a safe, reliable and professional trekking company to the Himalaya."

I saw Nepal Eco Adventure online, did some research, and emailed Chhatra, the owner of the company. Chhatra was prompt, extremely thorough in answer questions and making suggestions to fit my criteria of a 14+ day trek with a few high points to climb. I ended up booking a trek tailored specifically to my dates through Langtang National Park, Gosainkunda lake region, the Helambu valley and Nagarkot, followed by a night in Bhaktapur, a beautiful city near Kathmandu. Chhatra was very clear on what was included in the program so there was no confusion and he even picked me up at the airport and dropped me off when I left. Chhatra runs a very thorough and intelligent company, plus he was a guide himself, so he understands the other side of trekking, so you end up with a company owner who understands the intricacies of all sides of this business. Chhatra found another person to help drop the costs on my end and quickly set up a porter to help the woman with her bag. Our guide, Jiba, was very experienced and knowledgeable. The accommodation was nice and the food was good and plentiful. Whenever I come back with the intention of using a guide, I will contact Chhatra only. I fell in love with Nepal on my trip and for good reason. Before I even left, I was trying to figure out what my next Nepal adventure would look like."

            "review": "Trip of a lifetime!. Hi, my review is long, but I hope you\u2019ll agree, worth the read. Chhatra at Nepal Eco Adventure was my guide for an unforgettable 23 day trek, last March, from Giri to Gokyo, Cho La Pass and finally onto Everest Base Camp, then back to Lukla for our flight back to Katmandu. On arrival, I was greeted at Katmandu airport with a friendly face and reassurance that Chhatra would look after me while in Nepal. We had previously been in contact by mail and I\u2019d felt I knew him before we had meet from his mail correspondence. Chhatra organized the accommodations in Katmandu, as well as each night along the trek, all the necessary visas into the parks etc. I had a fairly rough idea of where I wanted to visit along the trek, before reaching the main goal of Everest Base Camp as the highlight. I had a few last minute supplies to pick up before the trek and Chhatra was very helpful taking me around Katmandu to pick these up as well as a tour of Katmandu\u2019s main attractions the day I arrived and more attractions following the 23 day trek. Day 1 comprised of an 8 hour mini-bus twisty ride to Giri. It was a good experience, enjoying the local daily on-goings as well as providing an intro to Nepalese life, while providing a buildup to starting the trek. Along the trek, Chhatra was very informative of the surrounding village\u2019s main attractions, local mountains etc. and any local info that was worth mentioning. I did have a porter and felt a little guilty at times, but Chhatra reassured me that I was providing employment in the area. We stopped off at Chhatra\u2019s parent\u2019s village for a night to meet up with his family and see the various local projects, which Chhatra helped secure the financial backing for and helped with securing local labor, providing jobs for the local community. One of the many projects in his village was a new school, built from the financial help of a Scottish group which Chhatra guides on a frequent basis over the years. I have to say that Chhatra is a friend that\u2019ll watch your back, tend to your every need and provide the upmost service that you require on a once in a lifetime trip, that you won\u2019t forget. If you want to experience Nepal at its best from a trekker\u2019s point of view, I\u2019d highly recommended starting your trek from Giri, if you can afford the time. It\u2019s also a great way to acclimatize your body to the altitude. This is similar to the route that Sir. Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay took while on their way to conquer Mt. Everest, so you\u2019ll be walking the route that\u2019s been part of history for the past 60 plus years. For the first week of the trek, I only saw/met a handful of trekkers. It wasn\u2019t until we joined the main route to EBC, that within the first hour, I\u2019d saw at least 100 tourist trekkers. Starting the trek from Jiri gave me more of an appreciation of the Nepalese locals and scenery, away from any tourists. A majority of the trekkers are in the 50 \u2013 70 year range. This must be due to the fact, that this type of trek is a once in a life time trek for them, or on their so called bucket list. You\u2019ll notice a majority of them won\u2019t make it all the way to EBC, due to altitude sickness. The route can vary from, normal hill walking to steep hill trekking. We passed by the famous Gokyo lakes and climbed the 5,000 plus meter Gokyo RI mountain peak the following day for a fantastic view of Mt. Everest and local glacier. The only deviation from the trek was that we could not trek over the Cho-La-Pass due to heavy snow blocking the route. This wasn\u2019t an issue, we just took an alternate route and kept on schedule. The alternate route was just as impressive. I was glad that Chhatra kept my safety in mind.You can build in rest days, which is recommended, not only for rest, but to visit local sites while acclimatizing. Chhatra will help you tailor your trek to your liking and time constraints, but you can\u2019t predict the weather at times, but Chhatra kept us on schedule. My trek started on Feb 28th 2013, for 23 days and had no major issues with the weather apart from the odd rain and snow shower. The trek is very manageable, but you do need to be fit. The Giri-Gokyo-Cho La Pass and finally Everest Base Camp trek will guarantee you fantastic and unforgettable views along the way, especially of the mountain peaks the higher you get. The snow covered hills and mountains can be surreal at times, with Everest and surrounding mountain reaching up to 8,000 meters. As soon as we reached our daily destination, Chhatra was on the case of organizing my room for the night. Before he and the porter got their room, I\u2019d have my bags in my room and the low down on the t-house, regarding the shower and meals available. All you need to do for the night is pick a good book and put your feet up, chat and plan your next day\u2019s route.When my wife came to visit me following the EBC trek, I booked a separate trek, again through Nepal Eco Adventures, with Chhatra and the porter to Phoonhill, to witness an unforgettable sunrise. She was feeling a bit under the weather at the time, but Chhatra stayed by her side for the duration of the 3 day trek. No matter how long the trek took, Chhatra stayed with her and treated her with the utmost respect, which we are very grateful. Chhatra and his guides will help you sculpt the trek you\u2019ve always dreamed of, focusing on your schedule and objectives from your bucket list trek. He\u2019s a very trustworthy guide and companion. He speaks fluent English and is very knowledgeable of the routes and locals along the way. You\u2019ll enjoy amazing hikes each day, where you can get into in-depth conversations with Chhatra or he\u2019ll leave you walk away, while you listen to your favorite tunes or eBooks.There\u2019re plenty of trekking companies out there, but I can\u2019t recommend Chhatra and Nepal Eco Adventure Ltd highly enough to book your next trip with. His rates are very competitive, but companionship, trust and most of all an unbelievable guide, which is priceless away from home. I hope you book your next trip with Chhatra\u2019s company and have the unforgettable trip as I did.All the best,Pat."

My trip to cross the Nepali/ Indian border was even organised for me. As a solo female traveller, I can say that I felt safe with the guide the company provided me with. He had an excellent level of English and there were no communication problems at all. He was also very knowledgeable about the local surroundings and could help me with anything I needed and answer all of my questions.I would love to return to Nepal one day and if I do I will definitely use this company again, and would recommend to others, especially solo female travellers who are a bit nervous."

In September 2013 I went to Nepal alone as a woman to explore Nepal and go trekking.From the beginning, Nepal Eco Adventure organised everything really well, they picked me up and took me to a great hotel in the middle of Kathmandu.After 2 days of sightseeing I started trekking to Everest Base Camp and Kala Patthar. My guide was Chhatra Karki, he was more than great, professional, helpful andreally experienced. I wasn't sure what it would be like to do a trek like this on my own as a young female traveler, but Chhatra made me feel comfortable and seemedto intuitively know when I needed help and when I needed space. I felt very safe throughout and he explained me very interesting things about nature and culture.It felt like trekking with a friend I know a long time, which was great. Chhatra knew so much people in the teahouses along the way and he had a good relationshipwith all the people there. Everyday he was open and flexible for my ideas, we did some great and isolated side trips and everyday was an adventure. The highlight was the peak day on Kala Patthar with sunrise behind the Mount Everest in the early morning. The trip was one of the best things I ever did and their could have been no better company and guide for me to organise that!After coming back to Kathmandu, Nepal Eco Adventure organised a relaxing trip to Chitwan National Park to do some Elephant Back Safaris and to watch Rhinos in the jungle anda trip to Pokhara. Within this time of the side trips they organised my Indian Visa and everything worked out perfectly.The whole stay in Nepal was well organised and just awesome, I cannot recommend this company enough!I felt safe all the time and I can recommend Nepal Eco Adventure to all females who want to travel alone.Highly recommended to all people who want to explore Nepal in an authentic and amazing way!"

We had contemplated doing the Annapurna circuit on our own, but ultimately decided to go with a guide--great decision. Our guide (Shiva) was fantastic--excellent English and a lot of fun! Chhatra (owner, trek coordinator) was extremely responsive and accommodating--very knowledgeable and genuinely a great guy. We made several last minute changes to our trip and he was able to work them out without delay. We will definitely recommend Nepal Eco Adventures to friends and family and will most certainly use them again when we return to trek the Langtang region."

Transport and equipment and all this outher stuff around were perfectly organised and chhatra our guide took so much care about us. with his clear english he could give us an extensive introduction to country and people. Lang Tang during beginning spring was amazing with its rich colours and the warmth of the people. Threre were just a few outher tourists around during that time which made it even more peaceful. i can highly recommend chhatra and his crew for doing reliable service and giving a familiar feeling."

I have used Nepal Eco Adventure three times in the last four years, travelling with two of my sons on one occassion (Annapurna Circuit), a group of friends (Makalu Base Camp) and a couple of months ago a solo trip(the high passes of the Everest region)This company have the versatility to organise a remote camping trek or just ensure that one gets the most from the Teahouses routes. Whatever it is you have in mind the Guide will have excellent English and the ability to ensure you are aware of all that you are seeing around you, particularly the cultural aspects of whatever region you are travelling in. The customer service ethos is strong and there is an empathy with a western client that results in their willingness to show off the full glory of Nepal.Both Guides and Porters have a willingness to interact - so expect to trade knowledge and opinions about the West - and lots of banter!

The first time was in the Annapurna region, over the ThrongLa Pass. Back then Chhatra was the lead guide and I knew then, that should I return to Nepal, I would like to trek with him again. I am lucky enough to have returned and this time used Chhatra's very own company, Nepal Eco Adventure. I am delighted that Chhatra Karki has made this progression as he certainly deserves to do well. My second trip was to EBC. All my airport transport was well organised and even though my flight was delayed, Nepal Eco Adventure (NEA) waited for me to arrive. Accommodation in Kathmandhu was organised for me and was very good as well as some of the friendliest lodges along the trek. NEA arranged other side trips for me to participate in. These included a jaw dropping trip to the Temples in Bhaktapur and a relaxing stay in the national park at Chitwan where I was able to observe Rhino in their natural environment and many species of birds as well as crocodiles and elephants. Back in the mountains, after each days trekking, I was able to enjoy a short, interesting talk about the area, culture and religions of Nepal. I always received excellent advice on health and safety and felt very well looked during both my trips. Finally, two further reasons why I would only trek with NEA and Chhatra Karki. He pays his porters a proper wage without fleecing westerners, unlike some of the larger western companies and on my last trip I suffered with altitude sickness but NEA got me down quickly and safely. While I was recovering back in Namche Bazaar I witnessed another trekker being helicoptered out with HACE. My family will always be grateful to Chhatra and his company for getting me down safely and recognising early enough how sick I was becoming. I owe Chhatra and his company such a lot. I cannot recommend this company enough. I had so much fun with NEA, Chhatra and all his porters, I cannot imagine trekking with anyone else."

This is NOT the case with Nepal Eco Adventure; every rupee counts towards an authentic, honest and eye-opening experience. After some months in Kathmandu me and a group of friends decided to walk the Annapurna Circuit and luckily found Nepal Eco Adventure and Chhatra Karki. Chhatra was our guide for the 20+ day trek, and knew the circuit like the back of his hand. Speaking fluent English, Chhatra had answer for all of our questions, and often a story to go with them. He was as chatty and affable as he was serious and alert, and wherever we went, Chhatra always seemed to know where to stay and who to talk to. We would often talk during the course of the trek and once it was over we all felt that we had gained a friend as well as having shared a wonderful experience.No matter the trail that you decide to walk, choose Nepal Eco Adventure and I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

Excellent English with even a hint of a Scottish accent from his yearly Scottish HIkes. Chhatra is a very genuine guy and I'd have a drink with him as easy here in Ireland as in Katmandu. Down to earth, open and intelligent. I'd have no problem recommending Nepal Eco Adventures to anyone and if you'd like you can PM me and I can discuss costs/Annapurna/times etc. I also did a 3 day Chitwan National Part package with NEO.

Having trekked to Everest Base Camp in Khumbu, Nepal with Nepal Eco Adventure, I cannot recommend them enough.A local company using only local staff, the guides and porters are of the highest quality, with a rarely seen zest and contentment in their work. My guide had an enormous amount of experience, was deeply knowledgeable and was better equipped than any of the guides you will find in the mountains. The team were naturals at their work and extremely professional in their duties, and really made the difference on this trek \u2013 making a great trip into a truly unforgettable experience.The trip was absolutely incredible and I would encourage any able-bodied and properly-equipped individual who is considering it to go for it \u2013 from the chaos and diversity of KTM to the landing at Lukla to the endless 6000m+ mountain vistas and the unique landscape of base camp and the approaching glacier, which is like an alien planet. There are too many great things to experience and remember about this trip, is was a complete sensory overload. Things went pretty much as expected, I had planned to go to EBC, then over Cho-la and Renjo-la Passes and back down through to Lukla via Thame. However after EBC we reached Dzonghla, which is the only stopping place before crossing the path, only to experience heavy snow overnight making it too difficult to make the pass so we had to head back. That was disappointing but freak unusual weather can occur anytime.I would use Nepal Eco Adventure's services again without question. I saw many guides, some of which were substandard and didn\u2019t really do anything more than the minimum required, their customers were complaining but I did not have a single thing to complain about. The service started as soon as I arrived in Kathmandu and lasted for the complete duration of my trip, despite some large changes of plan during the trip. They have plenty of solid international references, which checked out very well and having used them I now add myself to that list of references, please feel free to contact me direct if you need any further information. Using Nepal Eco Adventures is the only way to trek the Himalaya - you will be provided with sincere support from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave; you will experience a deep sense of local life and culture which many trekkers do not see; you will have the best photos of your trip; you will be contributing only to directly to the people of this wonderful country. It is 100% guaranteed."

My friend found Mountain Mart Treks on TripAdvisor due to all its wonderful reviews, and after completing our trip with them on Oct. 19, I can also attest to their wonderful services! Their Managing Director, Dolakh, communicated all the necessary information for the trip and quickly answered any questions we had via email. The packing list they provided was very helpful--it definitely helped me figure out, and narrow down, what to bring. And I love how MMT offers the option to use their down sleeping back and/or jacket for the trip, as well as a duffle bag to be used on the trek.Since the day arrived in Kathmandu, MMT took really great care of us. Our arrival was delayed due to weather and we didn't get in until midnight, but our driver Bishnu and our guide Prem was waiting patiently for us and promptly got us to our hotel. MMT put us up at Hotel Apsara and they also provided great service--despite the kitchen being closed at midnight, they still allowed us to order some chow mein for dinner and it was really good!Our guide Prem came by the next day to take us to the MMT office to meet Dolakh, settle our balance, and get a sleeping bag and our duffle bags. Dolakh also was able to exchange money for us at a great rate.Prior to our EBC trek, we did have one extra day we used to tour Kathmandu for the day. We were picked up by the same driver who picked us up from the airport, Bishnu, and he was really patient and wonderful as he drove us throughout the city to visit 4 temples.For our EBC trek, everything went so smoothly! We really got lucky with the weather. We were able to fly in and out of Lukla with no issues, and our guide Prem and porter Sudip were wonderful! They both took really good care of us on the trek. BTW, I really appreciate the fact that MMT is willing to keep the travel groups small--I truly felt like they were invested in making sure we had a great trek, and that it was NOT about the money. I was the slowest in the group but I really appreciate how Prem would tell us \"bistarai, bistarai\"--\"slowly, slowly\", assuring me that it was ok that I was slow and that we would still make the next village in good time. And we always did! And our porter Sudip? I am amazed at how he seemed to carry our 20 kg duffle bags with no issue all throughout the trip! In fact, I'm just amazed with all the porters, as well as the local Nepalese who carried heavy loads of supplies between villages throughout the trek.I wasn't expecting much with the accommodations throughout the trek but I was pleasantly surprised. The walls are thin in all the tea houses, and the rooms got smaller as we got closer to EBC, but they all provided comfy beds with clean sheets and blankets. We were able to have private bathrooms until Namche Bazaar but we did switch to shared bathrooms for most of the trek. And all the tea houses provided meals that were included in our package. Prem and Sudip served us our meals and helped us eat what we couldn't finish. :) They also made sure that we had treated water every night and every morning. Prem also checked our resting heart rate and oxygen saturation each night, and often asked us how we were feeling on the trek. I really appreciated Prem checking in on how we were feeling.One additional thing Prem did that I really appreciate was that he helped get a cake for my friend in Tengboche for her birthday. He even was willing to pay a share of it, which was sweet but I insisted I would pay for it all.Prem was overall just a great guide. We were really lucky to have him on the trek. He made sure we had all we needed, he answered all our questions, and he was funny and easy to get along with.The EBC Trek was probably the hardest thing I've done in my life, but I'm so glad I did this with MMT because they were so supportive. They definitely do all they can to make sure the trek is a success. And their prices? I don't think you can get a better deal! I mean, we got our own driver to and from the airport as well as for our Kathmandu city tour, we got our flights to and from Lukla, and all our meals and lodging on the EBC trek were included. And the price they offered was the lowest among the trekking companies we looked at!I would HIGHLY recommend doing the EBC trek with MMT! I've already recommended them to all my family and friends who may be interested!MMT - Thank you so much for an amazing, once-in-a-lifetime trip!"

He arranged for us to meet our guide that afternoon and insisted that we should be happy before booking. We were ready to start our trek the following day (in the middle of Nepalese national holidays!). Our guide, Makar, and porter, Raj, were excellent. Makar was very knowledgable and ensured we were staying in the best guesthouses at each stop, booking in advance if it was required. They were both so kind, helpful and nothing was too much for them. We had great fun in the evenings as well, chatting and playing cards - exchanging Nepalese and English games - and they became good friends.Makar even came to our hotel to ensure we had the right clothing and equipment before commencing our trek. Dalakh kindly leant us a down jacket, sleeping bag and poles for the trek. Everything was included - breakfast, elevenses, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner. We ordered as much as we desired and always had full stomachs. The snacks (chocolate, cookies, fruit) were envied by our fellow trekkers using other companies. He even supplied a first aid kit, with Diamox (which we didn't need to use), analgesia etc.The circuit itself was amazing. We adjusted our itinerary for the last few days and Dalakh was kind to accommodate. He even arranged an airport transfer for us after we got back (for free). It is difficult to choose travel agents in Kathmandu but we genuinely think this company would be among the best. We felt we got good value for money and would not hesitate to book again!!"

The accommodation was basic, but nice - we were definitely staying in the better tea houses in each village. And the food was fantastic!Most of all however, our guide and porter (Ram and Padam) continually went out of their way to make sure everything was going well, and ensured we had an amazing trip from beginning to end.If you're looking to book the EBC trek (or any other trek in Nepal) through an agency, I can't recommend Mountain Mart strongly enough. Highly professional, and they'll make sure you're well looked after the entire time."

From a sea-level dweller at 20,300ft - thank you Tenjing Sherpa for your expert guidance!These guys were incredible with our Island Peak & Everest Base Camp Trek!Pre-departure communication and information was really clear and timely.Dolakh was highly informative and ensured that all arrangements were in place for our arrival.We had a last minute travel change which was handled exceptionally efficiently by the company. Everything was seamless and we did not have to concern ourselves with any logistics.From hotel transfers to local tours and Khumbu Region treks - all were arranged to a high level.Accommodation at the tea houses as with all treks become more limited with increased altitude. However, we received the best available at remote locations - and we even had wifi! Safety at no time was ever compromised.I'd give them a big old rating of 110/100!"

From us picking up, to booking all our hotels might i say they picked the best kathmandu had to offer, they were very polite, friendly and they did everything we asked and more. Even when the lukla flight was cancelled on the 1st day for bad weather they pulled out all the stops and re-arranged if needed another trek to pokahara, lucky for us the flight went next day. Our guide yukumar was the best, he looked after me like i was his sister when i fell ill on the trek, and even arranged a helicopter back from lukla to kathmandu when the weather changed on the way out. they chauffered us around kathmandu to visit temples waited for us, we had a meal with dolakh and his lovely wife chatting about family, england nepal and politics lol. We spend 3 weeks with these lovely people and my dream is to visit them next year for another trip,"

They only use very qualified guides and porters and were very helpful with recommendations even after our trip to EBC had concluded. HIGHLY recommended."

EBC trek is definitely one you can do on your own, but MMT had all of our transportation, lodging, meals, permits, and most importantly, flights to/from Lukla taken care of, which is no small task. We had Prem as our guide and he was great. Knew all of the mountains, knew the trek very well, and was always making sure we had everything we needed. Ask him to teach you some local card games (bring cards or other games!). There are definitely bigger companies out there offering similar treks (i.e. REI), but MMT holds their own and at a much lower price (plus you're supporting a local business). I would not hesitate to use MMT again or recommend to friends/family. This is a trip I had been wanting to take for a good 10 years and it did not disappoint."

And when indifferent weather presented us with problems at the start of our trek he made alterations effortlessly.

He appreciated that holiday time is valuable, listened to what we wanted and ensured that no time was lost for any reason. Thankyou for everything!Our mountain guide Kumar was brilliant. Nothing was any trouble for him and he looked after us amazingly. We made a nice group and I would love to hike in the Himalayas again with you one day. I am sure we will.And the company driver Bishnel was a delight to spend time with. A very talkative person who somehow manages to navigate his way through the traffic of Kathmandu effortlessly whilst pointing out the sights. Very punctual even in the small hours of the mornings.I will not hesitate to book my next trip to Nepal with Mountain Mart Treks and I am very much looking forward to that day. I wish you guys all the very best and Thankyou once again.A recommended company from myself."

            "review": "Annapurna Base Camp Trek. The experience with travel begins with the arrangements and competency of the company organizing the trip (in this case trek). Originally, our vacation was planning to do the Everest Base camp (EBC) under a 12-day trek. However, Mother Nature changed the original itinerary. Doing EBC is all about getting into Lukla and sometimes the weather does not cooperate for several days. Our plan for EBC was abandoned since all flights into Lukla weer canceled for several days and lost our rest days for acclimatization. Mountain Mark (headed by Dolakh) deftly managed our expectations and suggested that Annapurna trek be completed instead. It was not a disappointment. Our guide (Tilak) and porter (Ram) were indispensable in making our trek very comfortable over a 10 day period. The guide watched over our needs during and after our daily hikes. Both guide and porter would cater to us during off times (meals, evenings). Making sure our dinner was ordered and arranging places to sleep in various tea houses. The visual beauty of the ABC trek more than offset the disappointment of missing the opportunity of trekking Everest. The key days involving the morning hike up to Poon Hill and watching the sunrise over ABC were perfectly clear for fantastic photo opportunities. The trek itself was overall modest in terms of difficulty...just be able to walk up/done stairs for hours at a time (about 4-7 hours per day). Thank you Dolakh, Tilak and Ram for a memorable vacation. We be back to accomplish the Everesr Base Camp trek during the spring of 2018.One suggestion for those doing EBC. It might be worth the effort to book several days flights into Lukla (aka 1st flights). Once a cancellation occurs on flights into Lukla then one gets bumped into the 3rd or 4th flight the next day and so on. With limited vacation time, the odds of doing EBC diminishes unless weather is perfect."

However with all the companies out there in Kathmandu offering 'the best' it's hard to distinguish what was.... That was until we gave mountain mart treks a go. Right from the booking process whilst at home in England, dolakh (MD of company) added my wife on whatsapp and ensured everything was answered. Upon arrival in Kathmandu airport transfer was arranged to our hotel and then we went with our guide to mountain mart in downtown thamel to meet dolakh and finalise things before our big day! The next morning filled with excitement we had an early transfer to the domestic airport and our guide (Lochan) sorted everything for us. Flights from Kathmandu to Lukla can be very weather dependant and as such is out of control in terms of organising, but Lochan was always managing to be at the front of every queue and ensuring we were on the next flight! When we eventually arrived to lukla after cloudy weather all morning we met our porter Sanuvai whom can only be described as one of the strongest men I have ever met, him and Lochan always were very attentive to us and at meal times ensured we were looked after well! Mountain mart treks were the only company on our 12 day trek whom I saw who had a fully stocked first aid and drug bag (including the provision of diamox, cold and flu tablets, throat lozenges and any other drug you would need), as well as a pulse oximeter which was used every night after meal times to monitor oxygen saturations and pulse rates all of which were recorded by Lochan. Mountain mart treks pride themselves on good customer service and I can tell anyone whom is debating which company to use to go with mountain mart they went above and beyond and have exceeded any expectation I had. I will return to Nepal in the very near future and mountain mart treks will be the first company I will use for my treks, A big thank you to Lochan our guide, who provided a very knowledgable tour throughout our Everest base camp trek;Sanuvai (sudip) our porter whom worked tirelessly carrying out bags and looking after us at meal times; Dolakh for providing great hospitality and support in our planning and organising."

Dolakh and the team were amazingly helpful, picking me up from the airport and dropping me back and even taking me out for lunch!!. The trek its self was absolutely stunning and made so much better by my guide Raju who was always happy and so much fun and had such a great knowledge of the area - I'd recommend him to anyone! Thank you mountain mart for wonderful service, even though you're probably the cheapest company on the market. Don't think twice just go for mountain mart!"

Our guide Prem was absolutely lovely and did a fantastic job. We both felt he really cared about making our trekking experiences as enjoyable as possible and about our wellbeing throughout our time in Nepal along with his great sense of humour and interesting knowledge of the area. I would highly recommend Prem, along with our porter Nabin, to anyone wanting to trek in Nepal.Mountain Marts service before and during our trip was excellent and very personal which made the trip to Nepal incredibly stress free throughout, which I don't think would have been the case without such exceptional service. I would however recommend to other travellers to ensure time for some flexibility around your trips and departure from Nepal, especially at this time of year, as we had quite an intense itinerary due to prebooked flights and this at times meant the trekking was much more intense than we thought it would be (sometimes arrow d 12 hours a day) and meant we had to slightly rush some parts of the trip and did not allow any time for hold ups so it is worth discussing this when arranging your trip.All round though a fantastic service and a company I would highly recommend."

Two days prior to commencement, I had two meets where all my questions were answered and was provided with any trekking gear I didn't already have! All equipment such as gloves and sleeping bags provided were great quality! I was luckily enough to trek by myself with local guide Lochant. Lochant was probably the funniest and most enthusiast person I've ever met! Full of energy ever day, always singing and dancing at night. Most nights we had the company of other Trekkers but when alone, Lochant did an excellent job at providing entertainment. Lochants knowledge of the trek, conditions and weather was beyond amazing! Each night he'd explain the next day's trekking path to amazing detail and answer and questions about steepness etc. As the altitude got higher, Lochant would continue to monitor myself and check for any altitude sickness symptoms. He definitely provided care to my self and had beyond adequate first aid supplies if needed (luckily wasn't needed). Any second we would have opportunities of good views, Lochant would be quick to request himself to take a photo of me-so I'm not short of photos. Lochants interactions with the locals also meant that our stays at well selected lodges went without dramas. Once the trek was over and we spent our last day together in Lukla, my flight was cancelled due to poor weather, Lochant arranged accommodation and flights and stayed with me for an extra day and didn't leave until my flight successful left. Where possible, Lochant and Mountain Mart picked accommodation with the best possible facilities such as hot showers and wifi if needed. Being the off season, little was open in most villages however Lochant was great at providing things to do. Having two acclimatising day-arranged by mountain mart, I felt no symptoms of acute mountain sickness and I was able to reach Everest Basecamp without feeling sick! I very much recommend have these days as the people we saw who didn't make it decided to skip acclimatising days. I very much recommend Mountain Mart and Lochant, I'll defiantly be coming back and using them. Small things such as providing chocolate bars and fresh fruit each day went far into providing excellent customer satisfaction. Despite the weather which was out of our control, I had the best experience with Mountain Mart, without any negatives. Even when times got stressful (when my flight to Lukla was cancelled) Lochant was able to provide excellent service and ensure I made it to Kathmandu. If you want to have an entertaining trek, I very much recommend Lochant!"

Look no further book with mountain mart treks!To be Honest I did not check the reviews before I stumbled open this office in Kathmandu. we spend half a day checking out EBC treking tours in Kathmandu the prices were very similar so we want to go with whoever offered the best service. I was immediately impressed by Mount mart treks. Their office is well presented the Manager Dolkah answered all our questions and queries directly and was very informative. Within 5 minutes we also met our Guide Prim. I wanted to meet our guide before we booked. he was very friendly and we got on well so we booked. Mountain mart offered us an all inclusive deal which included accommodation, water,snacks, chocolates, Tea and 3 meals a day this turned out to be very good value for money as it would have cost us more if we paid our selves. we averaged about 2/3000 rupees a day for food and Tea. The only thing i paid for on the trek itself was 3 bottles of coke and my sister had a shower at Lobuche which cost 1000 rupees! Absolutely no nickel and diming here and no hidden costs with Mountain Mart.The Trek its self was amazing. I myself have climbed Kilimanjaro before and I am used to altitude My sister has zero experience did minimum training or preparation (I told her to train before!) yet our guide Prim was experienced and set the perfect pace for both of us. Our guides timings were also very accurate! Lol this is Nepal but when he said 30 minutes more it really was 30 minutes more. Every morning our guide explained in detail what the day would entail and what to expect on the trek weather altitude gradient e.t.c another thing I liked about our guide was Im an amateur photographer so I like to stop suddenly, back track to get some yak pictures sometimes stray off the path and make everyone wait! But I did not feel any pressure at all from our guide or porter.The accommodation was acceptable and generally to a good standard dont expect the Hilton you came here to Trek! Guide supplied use with sleeping blankets and extra bedding when we needed it We got hot showers and electricity in our rooms up to Namche Bazar other Trekkers I spoke to did not have these facilities in their rooms.Our porter Lilet was amazing he catered to all our needs as best he could and I never caught him without a smile on his face! Try smiling while carrying 30kg using a head strap! Lilet also accompanied us on both our acclimatization day hikes and even all the way to the Base camp so he definitely went the extra mile.Bottom line I am 100% satisfied and I would definitely recommend Mountain mart Treks without hesitation as aspects of service were met or exceeded. Do your self a favour go straight to mount art and book your trip there when you arrive or email them you will save half a day shopping around! Then only thing they cant do is carry you up the Mountain, Though I'm sure Dolkah can arrange that if you asked!"

The first day was all we needed to see that they were serious about treating their clients with the best possible experience. All flights were cancelled that day but we were put on a helicopter, and the fee was paid by MM, so we were able to start our trek and stay on schedule. Our guide Kumar and porter Nabin were extreemly hard working and accomadating in every way possible and we enjoyed their company and all became a small family for two weeks. I wouldn't look at any other companies bc the prices are all similar and you stay at the same places and eat the same food. The only difference is the way you are treated, and MM treats you like family. Our next trek will certainly be with the Mountain Mart team."

The route was Gokyo valley, Chola pass, Everest basecamp and finally the climb of the Island Peak. Before choosing mountain mart I spoke to 5-7 other agencies in Kathmandu.Price /quality: I think the price level is just fair and right, not expensive and not low cost. I had no hidden costs. I booked an all inclusive package for the whole trek. If you only book the guide without accomodation and food you do not safe much. For me it was a great comfort not to worry or think about any expenses during the trek. I could always choose the meals out of the menu. One positve detail is that all mountain mart guides always have a well equipped first aid kid, including AMS tablets (Diamox). I have not seen this at other agencies. Guide: One of the key factors for a good trekking holiday in Nepal is a good guide. My guide was \"Raju Tamang\". I strongly recommend him, great person!!! His english is very good. He also has a high knowledge of the landscape/ nature, people and culture. He explained me many thinks. We also had lots of fun. Raju has a very good contact to the owners of the lodges. Therefore I always had some little extras, e.g. better rooms, food, ....I have to say... Thank you Raju and Dolakh for this great holiday!

Manaslu requires a special permit, which can only be obtained through a registered trekking agency. Therefore, you cannot do this trek on your own. But a guide and a porter make your life much easier anyways - in particular it is very helpful that the porter can carry extra gear. For the whole 15 days I have not met any other trekkers, which I enjoyed very much but if you are looking for more company, this is probably not the right trek. The trip was very well organized by Dolakh, though you should be aware that not everything runs perfectly smooth in such a rather remote area. In our case the next two lodges after crossing the Larkhe Pass were closed, which prolongated that day by approx. 5 walking hours. Therefore, if you are going in the off-season it might be advisable to specifically request that your group's arrival is being pre-announced (most lodges have telephone and can therefore be reached before arrival). I am pretty sure that they would come and open if a small extra fee is being offered. Due to that long day, we shortened the trek by 1 day and Dolakh was very flexible in getting the jeep to Besi Sahar one day earlier."

This process continued throughout the entire trek along with Lochan and Gokarna cracking jokes, telling us stories and also a lot of singing from Lochan. Along our trek we meet other trekkers who were all impressed with our guide and porter. The other trekkers keep saying your \"guides\" are very involved and we had informed them one of them was our porter (Gokarna). Everyone said the same thing that they rarely even seen their porters or even interacted with them, but to have him interacting with us was impressive.

            "review": "Amazing Trek. I took the 7 days Annapurna Base Camp Trek with Mountain Mart in winter February 2016. Dolakh Thapa made all arrangements professionally, added with great hospitalities and a 5-Star customer service, from before I flew to Kathmandu, arriving there for briefing and checking (extremely important), to after the trek completed. It was impeccable. One note that this trek is very demanding and was meant for fit people, although I managed to complete it successfully as planned, albeit with additional trekking hours everyday. Also that it was much colder in winter. Now, the hero of my trek was none other than Kumar, my trekking guide, without whom I wouldn't be able to make it. He's a very trustworthy, strong, athletic, smart, resourceful young man who took care of me in every way possible. He's very experienced and know every nook and corner of this trek. Among other things, he would push me harder, motivate me, lighten up the mood by cracking jokes, help me in many dangerous and difficult paths. He would advised me on what to wear depending on weather, and at the end of the day, present a nice fruit platter, a very nice gesture. He made my journey enjoyable although I was dead tired. Now that I've completed the trek, I felt like a million dollar. A million thanks to Kumar, Dolakh Thapa, and Mountain Mart. I highly recommend them to anybody. My trek has ended, but the memories will last for a long long time. And I still hearing Kumar singing: \"Priya, Priya, oooh, Priya , Priya. Priya, Priya, oooh, Priya, Priya.\""

Lochan made us feel like we were the only people on the trail and attended to every need and want. Him and his amazing cousin Gokarna who was our porter, held my hand my hand when I didnt think I could make it up Kala Patthar, they held my bag when I was sick with the Khumbu cough and they made sure that they held a place in our hearts :) Ill never forget them or this trip!

I have been to Nepal before trekking to the Annapurna Sanctuary with another company. The other company did fine but Mountain Mart is better. I really liked that they set the cost and stuck with it. Little unexpected costs always come up, and when they did Mountain Mart covered those costs even when it would have been reasonable for them to pass those costs on to us.The guide Tilak was excellent. He was very knowledgeable, upbeat, positive and very patient. He was a pleasure to be with the entire trip. I would highly recommend him.Since returning I have recommended Mountain Mart and will continue to do so. They are professional, thorough, local, easy to work with and just good people.

As for the trekking part, the transportations, itinerary, meals, accommodations - all of these were excellently arranged. Our guide Prem and the porter Nobin were very helpful. They would find the best lodges and restaurants for us. The mountain views was incredibly amazing. We went up to Poon Hill for sunrise and definitely worth a walk although you have to wake up very early in the chilly temperature. Eventually we ended our trip with a tourist bus back to Kathmandu. There was a bad traffic congestion. I would suggest others to take the air if budget allows. Last day we had a meal with the boss Dolakah. He was a really nice guy.Now I am planning to do the EBC and Island peak next year with their company!"

I found MMT to have all the required practical information I needed and a great price for what I was looking for (originally a 8 day trek to view Everest.) Upon my arrival in Kathmandu and speaking with Dolakh, I realized I had both the time and resources to make the 12 day trek to base camp a reality, so I went for it. Dolakh facilitated all the details and made sure I had the necessary gear I hadn't brought with me and off I went. Through a delay a 6 hour delay at Lukla airport due to weather, each day on the trail, tearing a ligament in my knee halfway through the trek, getting to Everest base camp and up to Kala Patthar and finally an emergency evacuation by helicopter back to Kathmandu, I was completely safe and very well taken care of. Every meal was always ordered ahead of time, I was encouraged to do day hikes on my acclimatization day, I met many beautiful people along the way, made lots of great friends and best of all fulfilled a huge bucket list item, to pay a visit to Everest Base Camp. My guides name is Kumar, a very kind, athletic young man with a great singing voice, who showed me a lot of patience and care through my painful knee injury and slow pace thereafter. What a journey, but one I couldn't have completed without Mountain Mart, Dolakh and Kumar, who went above and beyond the call of duty and base level of care for a relatively last minute client. When I say beyond the call of duty, I do truly mean that (Dolakh brought my personal items to the hospital in Kathmandu and drove me to the airport the day I left Nepal and Kumar came with me shopping in Namche Bazar to make sure I got all the warm clothing I needed last minute and then helped me to find a knee brace bandage in the interim.) They are wonderful people.I highly recommend!! You will have the best, most memorable experience! Good luck!"

I trekked with a friend of mine who never had been to Nepal and who did not have much trekking and walking experience. But the Poon Hill trekking is, although at some stretches hard because of the endless \"stairs\", not too demanding. It is a \"low altitude\" trekking. The little villages are all worth a visit and it tells a lot about the culture and way of life of the people living there. We stayed the night at nice lodges who were all used to have hikers. Good beds, good rooms, toilet inside the building, some even had a shower!!! The scenery of the Poon Hill trekking is very various and that's why we liked that trekking so much. Walking through forest, through nice villages, alongside riverbeds, and always the Annapurna peaks somewhere in the distance. Poon Hill itself was awesum!!!! Beautiful sunset, which made getting up in the early morning worthwhile!!! Again we chose Mountain Mart treks to be our trekking agency. I have done many trekkings with this company and they never let me down. Good, friendly guides who know their way around an who can tell much about the history and people of the mountains. Most guides are mountain men themselves and thus very used and familiar with mountain scenery, mountain dangers and mountain difficulties. On this trekking Mountain Mart provided us again a good guide who took care of us very well. Also the porter, a young man who did not speak English, tried his best to make contact which we appreciated very much. All and all it was a journey to never forget..because of the beautiful scenery, the nice compagny and knowledge of the guide, the characteristic villages and the good weather!!!! I recommend Mountain Mart very highly!"

I was traveling to Nepal to meet up with some medical colleagues to work at a hospital but we had a few weeks before to trek, and the Annapurna Circuit was the perfect length of time. One of the group members had done ABC trek the previous year with a guide, Rewati Parajuli. She recommended him to lead our current AC trek and so we contacted him. He was happy to lead our trek, my husband and I met him via email and were very impressed and convinced quite quickly despite doing a good bit of online research for trekking agencies. He was extremely accommodating and thoughtful via email, very organized and sent us a perfectly thought-out itinerary for the trek based on what we had communicated that we wanted, with room for flexibility, and for a very fair offer I might add. The day we arrived in Nepal, we met Rewati and went to Mountain Mart to cover the essentials and we couldn't have been happier with our choice. A great trekking agency focused on professionalism, safety, no hidden costs, and responsible tourism to start. Our trek had a few unforeseen complications (such as a lost passport which complicated things, but again Rewati handled the situation like a pro), and 10 days in, the massive April 2015 earthquake hit just a day after we passed Thorung La Pass. But through it all, our guide and 2 porters were phenomenal and honestly we commented so many times \"what would we have done without them?\" Rewati is the most kind and gracious person, extremely well connected within the trekking community and was able to navigate us to a safe place after the disaster. I highly recommend both our amazing guide to a group or solo traveler and also our two porters Ganesh and Komol who were extremely fun, attentive, and who work so well as a team with Rewati. We spent many nights laughing together playing card games, drinking tea, or just chatting and learning about local traditions in the villages and Nepal in general. After our trek, we were touched and so thankful to continue our relationship with Rewati as he so kindly assisted in helping us with logistics (that none of us Americans could perform well in a foreign country not speaking the language) related to transportation and lodging of volunteer medical relief workers when we arrived to Kathmandu. His assistance in networking our logistics during this critical time when he didn't even have a home to sleep in shows the dedication and caring nature of Rewati Parajuli. A big thanks to Rewati, Ganesh, and Komol for the best trek of my life, I hope to see you again in Nepal on those amazing mountains. Thanks to Mountain Mart for employing these great people."

Being my first trip to Nepal and first trekking adventure to high mountains, I have no slightest idea about Everest region at the time when I started trip planning few months prior to the intended departure date. Having done some online search, 3 trekking agencies was shortlisted by me. Frankly speaking, MMT was not my top choice initially, but after few email exchanges , Dolakh the MD, was quick to convince me with his professional presentation and personal attention to details. At age 66 and in average fitness, I was grateful to Dolakh when he made me a fair offer and a flexible itinerary totaling 22 days of solo trekking when my only 2 other buddies finally decided to drop out. The tailor-made itinerary included 3 prime destinations, i.e. EBC and Kala Patthar, plus Gokyo Lakes as an option. However, in view of unfavorable weather conditions and forecast, I decided to give up all three upon reaching Gorak Shep.Was I disappointed then ? Absolutely not ! Taking advantage of the flexible itinerary and being solo trekker, I opted to switch over to \"soft trekking\" from village to village, which I truly enjoyed after slowing down my pace and re-tuning my mindset. The 16 days trekking in Everest region is undoubtably a fantastic trip of a lifetime. The breathtaking scenery of towering snow mountains, the spectacular views along winding trails, the peaceful villages that nestle on rolling hills and valleys, the hospitality and cleanliness of lodges provided for overnight stays or for meals, the friendly and ever smiling Sherpa villagers, all these mosaic up a fond and lasting memory.Not forgetting to mention Lochan who was my guide/porter and an excellent trekking companion. He speaks fluent English and is a very cheerful, understanding and helpful person. He always stay within visible distance from me while on trekking and is most attentive in serving meals, drinks, fresh fruits and tidbits at lodges. On several occasions when the trail became too demanding on me, he never hesitate to offer taking over my backpack albeit a heavy load already on his back, He is well-liked friend not only to fellow guides and porters, but also to locals both in villagers and those passing-by. Lochan is indeed the super guide that I highly recommend to any potential trekker, be it on solo, or in group.Sadly, my wonderful trip came to an abrupt end at Kathmandu when a devastating 7.8 big earthquake hit Nepal. Luckily, I was safe, unhurt and managed to fly home despite flight delays. I was deeply touched when merely 2 days after the big quake, Dolakh came personally to pick me up and drove me to the airport, at a time when he was most needed for caring to his own family and members of his staff who were still enduring tremors from continuing aftershocks.A big \"thank you\" to Lochan, Dolakh and MMT !"

We have trekked around the world, and can honestly say this experience was second to none. This was in large part to a wonderful guide, Rawati, and porter, Buddhi. Mountain Mart takes great care of the clients, and our guide was excellent about letting us experience this trek as we wanted to. They take excellent care of porters, which was much appreciated, because we had a great one in Buddhi. He has a smile and disposition that can warm any heart. The 7 day experience was fun, breathtaking, and just enough of a physical challenge to keep us feeling like we were working for it (our longest day was around 14 miles). The terrain is challenging, a lot of stairs. Much like the Machu Piccu Trek for those that have done it. There is never a dull moment. The scenery is incredible. The lodges are surprisingly comfortable. We had private rooms at most of our stops, and a warm shower, and bathrooms that were much better kept than most trekking experiences offer. The food was good, although caution must be made in your food choices. Rawati brought snacks, etc. Overall, just an incredible and memorable experience. I cannot give any higher of a recommendation."

Our family of four just returned from a very successful trek up to Everest Base Camp, and we would like to thank and recommend Mountain Mart Treks. We decided to use a tour operator, instead of trying to organise everything ourselves, and are glad we did. Absolutely everything was arranged for us, completely hassle-free, from pick-up at the Kathmandu airport to drop-off there a couple weeks later. Lodging, meals and permits were all taken care of, even when we 'deviated from the original plan'. We looked at the various operators, emailed our top five, and chose MMT based on their quick and positive replies, and their willingness to tailor the trip exactly when and the way we wanted. We couldn't have asked for more. The guide and porters were very helpful, but didn't get in the way - allowing us to meet and spend time with many other trekkers along the way.We would also like to recommend MMT's guide Prem, who has personally trekked all over Nepal and in the neighbouring countries, and made more than 150 trips to EBC. His experience, level-headed counselling and friendship allowed us to make the important decisions we needed to make along the way, and maximise our good time! If we decide to return to Nepal, to do one of the many other interesting treks, we will definitely use this team again."

Even picked up some Nepalese language from Ganes.One of the highlights of this trip to me was the night trek. We were late and was trekking in total darkness with help of our phone torchlights. Was very thankful to have Rewati with us then as it is dangerous to walk in the forest at night. Was scary too but with him there, I felt safe.As for the managing director, Dolakh also known to us as mob boss because he looks like one. Lol. He's very friendly and was flexible with our itinerary.

But with Tilak constantly on our back, looking after us, monitoring our progress, we didn't have any serious effects other than some light headaches.

We met other guides (from other companies) that would walk along side their group and leave for a bit with friends and come back, but not Bodrey. When we experienced over a foot of snow and thought we might not be able to make it passed, Bodrey was up all night trying to make a plan so we could push on and we made it! This was my husband's and my first trek. We've hiked in the US, but only for weekends. Mountain Mart answered every question I could come up with and within a reasonable time frame.

What makes Mountain Mart Treks special is that Dolakh Thapa is a still young and energetic, and an intelligent person who has long-standing experience with guiding tourists to the remotest places in the country before he started Mountain Mart Trips. Young, experienced and enthusiastic, I would say. MMT also does international events like treks around Mount Kailas (Kailas Yatra) - the holiest mountain in the world situated in Tibet over passes above 5000 meters (15.000 feet) -and book trips to Tibet, Bhutan and other uncommon destinations I have known him for more than 15 years as a reliable friend, and it is therefore no miracle to me that 80 % of the clients who he has helped earlier return to him when they come again. You have to try and perhaps you will also belong to that \u2018club of 80%\u2019 or even more. Dolakh claims a success rate of his trips of 99 % - I wonder where that 1 % comes from? Claiming perfection would destroy humility!Of course, if you make such a claim, you have to and will do everything to live up to it. That guarantees that MMT will do the utmost to satisfy your individual wishes according to your character (even if it is whimsical) or to suit groups according to worked-out schedules.It guarantees an unforgettable experience in this amazing part of the world!- Dr. Rudi Jansma, The Netherlands."

MMT arranged our 14 day tour of Nepal which included some Kathmandu sightseeing and a 10 day trek to Poon Hill and Annapurna Base Camp. Dolakh, who runs MMT, was very responsive from the first point of contact and provided all the information we needed for the trip. He also proactively followed up on flight information and details which were required for a smooth trip. After being picked up from Kathmandu airport, we were brought to MMT to meet our trekking guide and had our equipment checked out. MMT would make sure we had all the necessary gear and supplement any inadequate equipment. Coming from a tropical country, it was a really helpful step as some of our stuff was not suitable. During our 10 day trek, our guide Prem always made sure that we were trekking at a comfortable pace, had the best available rooms with hot showers and made meal times an occasion to look forward too! He would always tell us stories about the trail and life in Nepal. Trekking plans were dynamic due to weather and group speed, but Prem was always able to accommodate last minute changes by rearranging our accommodation plans via phone which was crucial due to the high demand of rooms from other trekkers. In many villages, we managed to secure a room while seeing many other trekkers being turned away. On our way up to ABC, we met many trekkers coming down who weren't able to summit due to the heavy snow and had stories of how bad the route was. However, Prem's experience came into play and brought us to our destination safely. When it came to the more treacherous parts of the trek, Prem would always ensure that we traverse them safely.In summary, Prem and MMT tried their best to ensure that we have the very best trekking experience and now I'm already planning my next Langtang trek with them!"

I went on the Everest Base Camp trek with a group of 6 friends with Mountain Mart from Mar. 9, 2015 to Mar. 19, 2015 and all I can say is that they are awesome. Our guide, Prem, was excellent, knowledgeable, made sure all of our needs were met, and genuinely cared for the safety of each person in our group. Prem had very good English and had many years of experience guiding treks in the Himalayas, including the EBC trek, and was always happy to share his stories. Prem's food recommendations were excellent. The porters were all friendly and superhumanly strong. The accommodations were on par with what you get in each village, although you need to temper your expectations as the higher up you go on the mountain, the worse the accommodations are. This is not because of Mountain Mart, but merely a reality of hiking the EBC trek.Now the important stuff. Prem made sure that we were taking appropriate measures to avoid symptoms of altitude sickness, including eating enough food so that we had the energy to complete the days trek, drinking enough water and taking diamox at the right time to minimize symptoms of altitude sickness. When members of our group did start to exhibit minor symptoms, i.e., headache (as is inevitable on the EBC trek), he made sure we were honest with our symptoms and made sure he was updated with how we were feeling at regular intervals. Our group had people with varying trekking experience levels and Prem was very good at setting a slow, but steady pace, especially on the uphill portions, so that we would all reach the next stop on the trek without being too tired or over exerting. Also, Prem demonstrated excellent route finding skills when it started to snow during the trek and the snow covered the trail. As an experienced hiker, to me this was a true sign that Prem was a very experienced guide. In addition, Prem's estimates on hiking time were amazingly accurate.Unfortunately, we had one member of our group that ended up with moderate altitude sickness despite our best precautions. However, I believe this illustrates how great Prem and Mountain Mart are. Prem was very helpful in identifying that the person could not continue because of the altitude and the difficulty of the next day's trek and arranging for a helicopter to come and take the person down. Prem was an invaluable resource in identifying a problem and providing a solution. For the EBC trek where weather and other issues can cause a delay or force you to change your itinerary, Prem's expertise was invaluable. I was very grateful for Prem's experience and judgment. Without a doubt, this is the type of guide you want for an EBC trek. While we always hope things go smoothly on an EBC trek, sometimes they just don't, and having a great, experienced, compassionate guide like Prem can help you get through the problems and still have a great experience.Mountain Mart is run by Dolakh and Prem. Both of them are honest Nepalese people who are trying to build a lasting business. I admire their entrepreneurship, kindness, commitment to service, and honesty and I hope this review leads you to choose Mountain Mart because I feel very indebted to Dolakh and Prem for helping make my EBC trek experience so memorable! I felt very well taken care of by Mountain Mart and can strongly recommend them to anyone looking for a great guide and trekking experience in Nepal. Thank you Prem and Dolakh!"

Over the course of the trek we ran into many groups that failed to make it past Lobuche (about 80% of total groups we ran into) but Bodri's ten years of experience completing base camp paid off and following his itinerary (which he had the ability to adapt readily to the changing weather conditions) we all made it with minimal if any symptoms of AMS.

This made planning for the trip easier and we could work more efficiently. There was no hidden cost and everything mentioned on their website are reasonably fair representation of the services received.Guides and porters were good and entertaining. One of our friend got the international air ticket booked on a wrong day and the boss was able to swiftly propose a solution for that. All in all, our group had a lot of fun on that trip. It was safe and smooth sailing"

Everything was sorted for us from the moment we went to the Mountain Mart office, we were picked up from our hotel the next day, taken to the aiport where our flight was delayed due to bad visibility Dolakh arranged a car for us to drive to Pokhara, where a jeep was waiting for us to take us up to the first stop on trek. From then on the guide and porter, also the amazing jeep driver, were so helpful and great throughout the whole trek. Lucikly we had a beautiful clear morning for our ascent of Poon Hill and the views are utterly breath taking. Thanks again for a great trek."

None of us actually trained for the trek & we're first timers, so we were slow, had altitude sickness (the girls), tripped a couple times but we were very well taken care of & completed the trek in schedule! Prem got us honey lemon ginger drink which was so good & helped with the altitude sickness!! And they brought fruits along for us too! Dolakh was also very kind and prompt in replying emails & helped to customise our itinerary for a 11 days trip (3-14th Dec 2013) - 2 days city tour in capital Kathmandu, 8 days ABC trek, last day in Pokhara city tour, including 30mins of paragliding! All accommodation, 3 meals during trek & breakfast in hotel in the city, domestic flight, down jacket, sleeping bag, walking stick were all included!"

Awesome trip to Annapurna Base Camp via Poon Hill and all the villages in between, I was part of the Niven's Eleven group that had a fabulous trip at the end of 2014. All the parts of our trip were organised by Dolakh and his team, this included sightseeing in the Kathmandu valley, our trip to ABC and some post trek R&R in Pokara and a couple of nights in the very nice Yak & Yeti hotel in Kathmandu, it also including a flight to the top the world to see Mount Everest and the Himalaya. Although the extra bits were brilliant the main reason for our visit was to trek to Annapurna and this was made possible with the support of our guides and porters who were AWESOME. Cannot thank Tilakh and his assistant Guness for all their support and encouragement on the trip and also for their patience as we took photo after photo for 10 days.We also had a late request of Dolakh to organise a 60th birthday party at short notice on our return to Kathmandu, Mountain Mart organised the venue (K Too steakhouse) and the birthday cake etc. a memorable evening was had by all, Willie (the birthday boy) could not believe it when probably the finest chocolate birthday cake I have ever tasted was brought out after dinner. Superb.If you are considering a trekking holiday in Nepal just contact Mountain Mart Treks & Expedition and let Dolakh organise it all, before he hands you over to Tilakh for what will be the trip of a lifetime."

Their package are transparent with little additional charges along the trekking unless you want to charge your electronics or consume bottled drink. We used Jeep transportation to trek starting point. The Jeep is in good condition and pick up are on time. For lodges along the trek, we had 2 nigh with gas fired shower which provides stable hot water.(Solar power shower is not stable in Winter times) At locations without gas fired shower, boiled water and shower bag were provided free of charge. Some minor concerns: Food safety along this rout is not so good,though this has nothing to do with the travel agent. It is advised to bring some medicine for stomach problemsThe Guide are equip with good shoes for snow, however, the porter wore a sneaker and will have problem if walk in deep snow for consecutive days."

We booked our base camp trek through mountain mart after seeing all the positive reviews on tripadvisor and this turned out to be a fantastic decision. Dolakh was an absolute pleasure to deal with and was quick to answer any questions we had about the trek. The trek itself was an amazing experience and a special mention goes to our guide Bodri who looked after us and ensured that we knew what was ok to eat and drink and made sure we took our time getting up the mountain. With his help and our amazing (and funny) porters we were able to make it to base camp without succumbing to altitude sickness like other groups we encountered on the way up. The jackets provided were excellent quality and the included food was more than you'll need on your trip. All in all the next time I book a trek in Nepal I'll be doing it through Mountain mart."

Thanks must go to our wonderful guide Tilakh and his assistant Guness for there support, advice, encouragement and effort to please our party of 12 walkers ( Nivens Eleven). I did a lot of research into reputable tour companies for this lifetime ambition and chose Mountain Mart based on there recommendations on Trip Advisor and there qualifications. Dolakh was on hand from day one of my initial enquires answering all queries and giving advice were required and giving me peace of mind. I had dreamt about this experience for 12 years and it truly was an emotional and rewarding journey. Equipment supplied was of good quality and some of the talker people in our group required larger jacket / sleeping bags and this was addressed. Our every need was catered for and the tea houses ( lodges) flushing toilets were of a very good standard and the food was very good (Dal Bat recommended). We enjoyed the company of both guides and the 6 porters assisting with our kit who tended to stay with the group and assist with directions, tea stops etc when required. Tilakh worked hard at ensuring we were well looked after and that was reciprocated with a wee dram (malt whisky) at night time when we had a night cap. The Lakeside Retreat in Pokhara was a great hotel and worth the swap of return flight for land journey which was a fantastic experience to see more of the culture and will live long in the memory of many in the group. On our return to Kathmandu Dolakh was very hospitable and took us to the K2 Restuarant for dinner that evening. If you are thinking about a trip in Nepal, we did the ABC, then I would have no hesitation in booking Mountain Mart and being in the trustyhands of Dolakh and Tilakh, you will be glad you took the advice..."

The both of them ensured that my group (4 girls) were well taken of. In fact, we were spoilt! We were able to order anything we wanted off the menu, and our belongings were always transported to our lodge room. Our welfare was well taken care of, with snacks and water provided along the way. They always ensured that we were happy, and that we would trek safely - the route was slippery and our porter provided us with support -- even whilst carrying all that weight! One thing I'd like to highlight is that the employees seemed really happy to be working for Mr Dolakh, which I feel is a really salient and important point. With a great boss, they would do their best and provide the best service to the customers. I had an amazing trip with them and I would go back again. :)"

Our guide Bodri was excellent - he customised the trip according to the weather conditions and we actually made it to base camp despite many groups heading back because of the snow. All food was included in the trip price, and there was plenty of it. The quality of the hired sleeping bag and down jacket was great. I would recommend doing base camp in December, there were hardly any other people trekking so at times we had the track all to ourselves. It is freezing at night (I think the coldest was about -30), but very pleasant during the day (we only had to wear a fleece jumper). If you're planning on doing EBC, definitely go with mountain mart!"

            "review": "4 Day Poon Hill trek. So the 5 of us decided to climb the 3210m Poon Hill from 5-8 December 2014. We went with Mountain Mart because it was the only tour operator we can find on the internet which offered the shortest trek up a Himalayan mountain. The price tag of USD380 per person which included transfers, meals and accommodation was also another attraction. We were not expecting much due to the low price tag, however 5-star service we received was a pleasant surprise. First of all, the company upgraded our land transfer from Kathmandu to Pokhara to a domestic flight without additional cost. The flight gave us an aerial view of the mountains and avoided a repeat experience of the return leg by land where we journeyed through mountain roads, busy towns and river crossings. For that, we were provided with a 7 seater Japanese MPV which made the 6-hour drive back to Pokhara a comfortable one. Our trek was accompanied by a guide, Prem Thapa and 2 porters, Ganesh and Nabin. I was surprised that they were quite young as all three were in their twenties. Nevertheless they were very professional. However, soon gave in to our chidings and we became friends quickly. The bond we built during the trek which were filled with conversations, laughter and even singing made the experience richer but less tiring. Even with our guards down, they were very careful not to cross the line between client and service providers. Prem also performed \u2018surgery\u2019 on one of our member\u2019s shoes which did an alligator. In terms of accommodation, they gave in to our request for en-suite bedrooms in the lodges in the hills which made our rest from the gruelling trek even more rewarding. There was also no addition to cost on this upgrade. On the last day of the tour, Prem acceded to our request to meet pre-school children in the Tibetian refugee camp in Pokhara where we distributed gifts we brought from Singapore. It was fantastic meeting the enthusiastic kids. And just before we were sent to the airport, we were taken to the office of our tour operator in Thamel, where Dolakh, the managing director, presented us with our certificates and a traditional cloth for good luck. It was a bonus that Thamel was shopping heaven for tourist to buy souvenirs at great prices for our loved ones back home. These last two visits were not part of the itinerary but was a very welcomed addition. There are many tour operators in Nepal but we would definitely recommend Mountain Mart based on our positive experience. They really took care of us and we felt the bond that we created went beyond business."

I really don't understand why other people go with the far more expensive other trekking companies such as ACE himalayas or intrepid, Mountain mart treks is top quality at such a competitive price. We booked our 12 day everest base camp trek almost one year in advance and were kept in regular contact with the team. Dolakh in particular was happy to reply to my constant emails during the months as I had plenty of questions! The team picked us up from Nepal airport and took us to see Dolakh at his office for a meeting before our trek the next day. He provided us with all the paperwork and information that we needed including all the gear that was promised to us. They even dropped us to our hotel after. We could not have asked for anything more during the following 12 days. We were transported to the airport and picked up at the other in end in Lukla by our guide and porter who were absolutely fantastic during the trek. Our guide, Lochan, was kind, enthusiastic, flexible and encouraging the entire time. If you're able to request him then go for it! We were fed all our meals and given plenty of tea breaks during the day which was all included in the price. As the trek got harder (after day 6/7) Lochan provided us with chocolate bars to keep our energy levels up which was a great help. Whilst we were on the trek we also noticed that porters from other companies would go ahead and leave the groups behind, meeting them at the guest houses later on. However, our porter (Super Binad!) did no such thing. He stayed alongside us every step of the way just in case we needed anything from our bags. He even told us that he knew we would feel more comfortable having our bags nearby. He even offered to carry my girlfriend up the final few steps when she was struggling with it all!! We kindly declined but the constant words of encouragement from them both meant that we were able to complete the experience. Lochan, our guide, was incredibly knowledgeable about the trek and the routes being able to give us a literal step by step guide of how the route and the terrain would pan out. Trust me, you will want to know where all the steep hills are! He was even able to educate us on what feelings were normal and not so normal to experience due to the altitude which we found very helpful and gave us peace of mind. When we were feeling unwell he provided us with medication and advice, all of which helped us. Due to both of their friendliness and warm heartednessnes we grew very close to them over the 12 days and this just made the whole experience more enjoyable. I couldn't speak more highly of Dolakh and his team and the incredible value for money that they provided us with. I really hope they rise up the list of trekking companies as the experience was one that we will never forget. We left Nepal with a once in a life time achievement and many some new friends. All the best guys!!"

The trek was fantastic and my guide, Ganesh, worked super hard to make sure we were staying in the best places and to make sure I had everything I needed. He was an excellent guide and though his English wasn't perfect, it was good and he made up for any lack of English skills with his eagerness to help, his kindness, and his willingness to teach me the basics of Nepalese. It also seemed like he knew every inch of the trail and all the places and people along the way, which was great. I felt entirely safe the entire time and felt like I was in good hands! I met other trekkers along the trail who were traveling with other companies and who felt their guides were trying to cheat them or who didn't trust their guides and I didn't experience that at all. At the end of the trek Dolakh again made sure I had everything I needed and even came to see me off to the airport, which was a nice personal touch. I would definitely trek with Mountain Mart again and hope to one day soon!"

He answered every email and question I had before leaving for Nepal, and checked in with me during the treks as well. I was picked up from the airport, and taken care of for 3 weeks. Everything they promised to provide was provided. It was great not to have to worry as everything was taken care of from start to finish. I had great weather the whole trip, I would recommend this company to everyone."

I trekked with my guide Badri Panta from Mountain Mart Treks in June 2014 and had the best time of my life on the trails of Annupurna Circuit. On every step of the way, my guide Badri was helpful and informative on the local cultures, history and food. I was delighted to be introduced to many of the local snacks and that made the difference. Badri was friendly and very fun as a guide and companion on the trek. He was able to point out the finer details of trekking in Annapurna and most importantly Badri had a good command of English. Doklakh, the manager, is a great person to deal with when I first contacted Mountain Mart Treks to arrange for my guide. Keep up good work, Mountain Mart Trek! Highly recommended."

I have forgotten even how many times I visited Nepal - its my favorite country. When he was still young (now he must be over 35) he helped me organizing beautiful treks and even then had so many contacts with the right people. I was happy for him when he could start his own business. He has traveled with me to remote places while organizing buses, airplanes - local and international - treks, permits, accommodation, money exchange and - last but not least - visa for India, including 'impossible' ones. He is a kindhearted and naturally helpful person and, if you didn't bring it yourself, he will give you the courage to act and enjoy. I am a low budget tourist, and usually travelling alone in the cheapest way, but for those who can afford it he will organize white water rafting, canoeing, 'jumping' off the mountain, helicopters to the snow and all the 'adrenaline' adventures you can have in Nepal. So try, and experience."

Through strong recommendation by another friend who has trekked with Dolakh several times, we decided to engaged his service. Dolakh was really helpful, patiently and promptly replying our numerous queries through email. He helped put together a 15 days itinerary which included an awesome trek at Langtang, day tours in Kathmandu & a short safari at Chitwan National Park.Dolakh personally received us at the airport and was a perfect host. At Kathmandu, we stayed at the FUJI HOTEL, which is a short walk away to bustling Thamel area where we could easily stock up on our trekking necessities. A day tour of Kathmandu was arranged by Dolakh, we were driven in a clean & comfortable car to various Unesco World Heritage sites and given ample time to explore the fascinating sites on our own. We even witnessed traditional cremation rites at the Crematoria at Pashupatinath Temple!The ultimate highlight has to be our 8days trek in beautiful Langtang. Our guide TILAK and porter SUDIP were excellent, they were attentive and took good care of my friends who were on their first long mountain trek. The Langtang trail meanders through breathtakingly beautiful valleys with quaint villages and amazing terraced fields, precarious suspension bridges, magical montane forests, meeting the very friendly villagers and finally a climb to the summit of Kyanjin Ri (4779m).After our trek, we made a short safari trip to Chitwan National Park where we got close encounters with elephants, indian one-horned rhinoceros and many other wildlife. Particularly unforgettable was a canoe ride along a river with numerous mugger crocodiles & indian gharials basking on the river banks!!!Having enjoyed our Nepalese adventure so much, I'm already making plans for another trek end of this year... with Mountain Mart of course!"

On all trekkings I had such a great and wonderful time. Every trekking is different as to toughness, scenery, altitude, but I can honestly say that ALL trekkings are worth while doing if you like hiking, mountain people and some effort and basic conditions!!!Mountain Mart has proven a reliable trekking agency with trust worthy guides and porters, who take real good care of you. Beside that I find that the guides of Mountain Mart know their bussines very well. They can tell you a lot about the scenery, the people, the trekking, the altitude etc. They are real professionals which gives a feeling of easy-ness. It is easy to make contact with your guide which is so nice and important especially to me, because I was doing the trekking on my own. For woman alone trekking with a guide is always a kind of risk. You hear stories of guides who get too familiar. But the guides in Mountain Mart are discrete, and I never ever felt like a had to be on my gard. I felt safe with my guide. I recommend Mountain Mart to everybody who loves Nepal and wants to do some trekking. The prices are fair and there is still room for negotianion.

The tour was very relaxed and we had the opportunity to provide our input as to what we wanted to accomplish and how quickly we wanted to accomplish it. I never felt rushed on the trek and the pace was set based on how we were feeling that day. The price and timing for the trek was also desirable. The trek with mountain mart treks was a couple days shorter than other companies which I preferred since it allowed for more time spent in Kathmandu and touring other areas.
