They have a terrific first class restaurant in the complex as well. If you want to purchase silk thread to knit with, ask for it at the restaurant check out counter.

Principally set-up to promote the legacy of silk retailer Jim Thompson, this well organized and informative tourist destination has what many Bangkok sights lack: well-informed guides, a carefully maintained offering and a holistic approach; providing a one-stop destination with quality cafe & bar, retail, tour, demonstrations and courtesy transportation. Located near MBK and Siam Discovery shopping centres, Jim Thompson House was the residence of an American trader who introduced Thai silk to the western world in the middle of the 20th century before making Bangkok his home and creating this striking riverside compound complete with private jungle garden. Tours run every 20-30 minutes, take about 30 minutes and provide respite from the concrete and chaos of the nearby streets. Photos can be taken in the lush garden but the House interiors have a no-photo policy.The adjacent restaurant, overlooking a tranquil koi pond, was able to prepare a tasty meal of pad thai and spicy fried chicken with enough time to eat in the 20 minutes we had before our tour commenced, so if you're hungry take advantage of the speed of service. Spoiler alert: Thompson disappeared in the 1960s without a trace, which begs all sorts of questions, but don't look for them here. The tour is very reverential of the trader, but this can be overlooked given the quality of the experience."

The Jim Thompson House & Museum is located on Soi Kaseman 2, only a short walk from the National Stadium BTS station, so it is easy to access via the Skytrain. The Hua Chang Pier is even closer, making access via the San Sap canal boats very easy.Jim Thompson was an American who set up home in Thailand after the Second World War. He revived the silk industry in Thailand. Initially an architect by trade, Thompson combined six traditional teak houses (each over 200 years old), that he sourced from around Thailand, and combined them to create his home \u2013 now the Jim Thompson House & Museum.Admission to the facility is 150 baht. The main house can only be accessed as part of a guided tour, so I had to spend almost 30 minutes waiting for my allotted tour to commence. The tour itself lasts 40-45 minutes but is a rather slow-paced affair as it ambles from room to room. The house and contents are interesting but the long wait for tours and the restrictions on access negatively impacted my enjoyment of the place.Photos are not permitted within the main house, but can be taken in the garden and outer buildings.In short, it is a relatively interesting place but nothing to rave about."

Jim Thompson house is very easy to get to, if you are going to shop at MBK then just walk down the road and around the corner it is very easy to find, otherwise take the BTS to National Stadium, which is a terminal station so you have to get off, then walk to the opposite side of the road to MBK and walk down the road and follow your map it is very easy.He was a man that served in the US forces during WW2 and stayed in Bangkok after the war,he then exported Thai silks and worked in Bangkok, this is the house he lived in so you get a very good idea of how western people lived here in those days, he also collected statues but you need to see them and not have me give away what they are like, his collection is very interesting.I was taken back by how beautiful his house was when he lived there and how things would have been in those days, the people giving you a guided tour are very interesting to listen to, there is a charge to go into see the house but the money goes for the upkeep as you will see the house is in beautiful condition.When we were there, there was a man taking the silk off the pods and getting it ready to be woven into the items you see for sale.I am sure you will come away from the house as we did thinking about how things used to be in JimThompson days here in Thailand.This is something you need to see when you are in Bangkok after that you can walk back to MBK for shopping."

Certainly recommend a visit here to view this beautiful old teak Thai house and outhouses. The tour was well conducted though the English speaking guide was difficult to understand most of the time. I needed to be up close to her to fully understand her.After the tour we saw some lovely Thai dancers perform in the courtyard along with some demonstration of silk weaving and how to extract the silk from the cocoons.

The house is now a museum and offers guided tours in several languages. You can buy the ticket at the house. I think the tour was including in the entrance ticket. The price was very reasonable. I saw a few tour operators online offered this trip at a very high price. I suggest you buy the ticket at the house. The guide was local, spoke English and was very informative and pleasant. Jim Thompson was an American architect. He transported the traditional Thai homes from their place of origin to Bangkok, and rebuilt them to fit his needs. It seems Jim had an eye for design since the house is full of beautiful furniture portraying a fusion of West and East. There is a lush garden with fishponds in the compound and a restaurant (I did not visit the restaurant) . Very relaxing atmosphere. It is easy to get to using the sky train. I highly recommend this visit to anyone interested in traditional Thai architecture or just looking for a breath of fresh air in this busy city."

One warning though, if you are disabled it's all steps and gravel paths and the likes so probably not suitable.Otherwise a beautiful afternoon."

Use the free shuttle from the main road and do not talk to any Thais that approach you in the street. There is a scam jewellery shop nearby and they are very subtle in their approach.

The guide for our small group that day as a bespectacled young lady called Nim.The tour of the red-hued house begins at the garden. The house comprises six houses joined together and was connected to a canal at the back. The garden also houses a small house for the spirits.Inside, the house is an eclectic mix of modern needs and Thai and Asian arts. Jim collects antiques like Buddha statues, chandeliers, maps and the likes from across the region and tastefully blend them into the interior design of the house. The house structure was put together like a puzzle without nails which explains why the walls were slanting. Another interesting feature of the house is the raised entrance to each room which Nim explains the reason as to \"keep the baby in, and the spirits out\".The tour was fun and I would highly recommend a visit to the Jim Thompson house. The guide was very knowledgeable and explained very well the historical details behind the house and the artifacts. The visit would take approximately an hour."

Just a couple of photos in hid bedroom and the authomatic vanal explaination of the guide. Would it be better to produce a video documentary.Thompson was an American architect and military advisory that was sent to Asia to help in the liberation of Thailand from Japan during the World War II. But he came late after the rendition of Japan and the official end of the war. But he got in love with Thailand and saw a bussiness opportunity in the then decaying Thai silk industry. He is the responsible of its revival thanks also for his big connections with powerful figures in Asia, Europe and US. To settle in Siam, he put also in play his love for architecture and antiqueties, bringing old traditional Thai houses from different regions and setting them as a living facility integrating the traditional Thai architecture with some Western comodities like the dining room. Then he brought several artifects, some of them really ancient like some stone statues from China, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand. Although a loyal Luterant, his Thai house, now this beautiful museum, is filled with a Buddhist inspiration and the harmony of the garden.In 1967 he traveled to Malaysia for what was to be a short vacation. He was with friends in Cameron Highlands, when on March 26, 1967, after attending the Luteran Church Ministry, he took a walk on the evening at about 4PM to never return. Thanks to his fame and good relations, a huge search was organized for 7 days with no clue whatsover. He enters like this in the history of mysterious disapeared people letting pages of speculations. Some months after his disapearance, his sister was murdered in US, but no connection with both events has been succesful. About this context no guide at the museum will tell you, but you can contemplate this beautiful house, the remaint of a very interesting man."

You can only visit with a guided group so you have to wait 10-15 minutes for your group to start (it start in time and if you are late you have to wait for the next group in your preferred language). The biggest problem was the guiding for me. The story of Jim Thompson is very interesting also the story of the houses and art but the guide's english was really hard to understand and she also sounded very bored. Taking photos inside is not allowed.The fabric store is very expensive but the tiny souvenir store has better price. If you have to wait more than 15 minutes for your group you can have a quick drink or a slice of cake in the cafe."

We paid for and entrace about 100-150baht I think and what we like about the place was that it was vety well organized, they have a lot of tour guides where in you can choose the langauge that they speak from Chinese, english, french and so on. They have a restaurant there and a souvenir shop that it nice but a bit pricey of course since most if the products are really made from Silk. The tour will take for about 30minutes and you would just be amazed as to the culture and history of Thailand. You are not allowed to take pictures inaide though and they would really ask you to leave your things in a locker that they provide. The plce is a bit far but worth the walk and money, people would really flock this area. They have other shops as well like the airport or other areas in Thailand but if you want the tour then go to the Main area"

The buildings are beautifully crafted and the tours are run very professionally. It provides a fascinating glimpse into the past and the Thai silk industry. Another highlight was the fabulous food in the cafe which is worlds away from the usual fried rubbish that tens to plague these sites. A super delicious salad washed down with a lush Thai dry white wine and the afternoon was complete."

It's told that Thompson is the father of the Thai Silk Renaissance - however the money he earned with his many official and inofficial jobs he spend for this little gem and the people working for the foundation taking care it are doing an unusualk professional job in explaining it to their guest. Leave the dusty, noisy streets and walk a few meters inside a little soi. It's unbelievable what a few square meters of Garden and plants can do. If their wouldn't be the engines of the public boat service on the klong - nobody could imagine not to be somewhere on the countryside. In my eyes it's the perfect place to finish a day of shopping and sightseeing (and our guests thought so too) before having a sundowner f. e. at Banyan Tree Hotels Moon Bar - Taxi shouldn't cost much more than 100 THB."

We chatted with him for a bit and then he directed us to the house.Jim Thompson's house is a sort of collection of Thai architecture and culture from different parts of the country. We stopped at the restaurant for a quick drink before the tour, and though expensive, the drinks were very good. A tour guide is included in the cost of admission, and will answer any questions you may have. The tour is good and I would definitely recommend putting this place on your list of things to do while in Bangkok."

The guided tour, provided in numerous languages, is an enjoyable way to learn about the history of Jim Thompson and his influence on the textile industry in Thailand. Each step of the silk production process is showcased with some demonstrations - this can be a great learning experience for children. The traditional Thai architecture transports you back into a simpler time - a wonderful escape from urban Bangkok. Extend the feeling of tranquility by having a glass of wine in the restaurant. The shoppers will enjoy the wide range of goods at the shop - a greater variety than other outlets."

A woman silk weaving, colorful spools of silk thread, and the beautiful gardens of the Jim Thompson House immediately takes you into a world of tranquility. The story of Jim Thompson and his reintroduction of silk to the US is fascinating. The collection of artifacts from all over Southeast Asia in the house is worth seeing. The tour (included with ticket purchase) takes about 35-40 minutes and requires you to remove your shoes and place belongings in a locker. The total time doesn't take much more than an hour and your ticket allows re-entry for that entire day. I went here in the morning and it was a good time -- wasn't busy at that time.Definitely recommend going here especially because it's so near to many other attractions/activities and shopping malls."

I didn't really know any details, I just new it was a collector's house. Now I know that Jim Thompson was an important figure in modern Thai history. His house and art collection is enchanting, the guides are charming, the garden is tranquil. And it's just a few blocks from the crazy shopping of MBK and Siam Sq. Worth a visit if you like history and design. You will need to remove you shoes and leave your bags in a little locker. No pictures inside. Tours available in many languages."

There are guides waiting who speak many languages. This attraction is the bringing together of various homes owned by Jim Thompson, an American who settled in Thailand after the war. His fascination with Thai silk, at that time a cottage industry, resulted a good business for him - he brought the silk to New York where he showed it to business people and Vogue editors, who fell in love with it.The building is a lovely representation of Thai tradition meeting Western sensibilities. Thompson was passionate about collecting Thai artifacts and did not want to see them poached or leave the country. There is a 7th century statue that is very beautiful that exemplifies his passion for collecting - it is without a head, but he did not care about perfection, it was still a treasure.The gardens of the house are lovely - it is like Eden in the middle of a city. There is a well rated restaurant that has a view of the garden and a koi fish pond. Not to be missed are the bookstore and a store filled with silk products (and very welcome air conditioning). In the courtyard there are explanations of silk production, along with a beautifully dressed woman providing an example of how to weave silk. I was very happy with the scarf that I bought, and grateful for the knowledge that I gained during my guided tour. I would highly recommend this site."

It's a quick visit but well worth the trip. Lovely gift shop and two restaurants. The causal restaurant had one of the best noodle dishes I had in Thailand. My daughter loved her massaman curry too.

He fell in love with the Thai culture and was pivotal in creating the silk industry in Thailand. The Jim Thompson house was set up by his foundation after his mysterious death creating an interesting illusion and fascinating back story behind a very beautiful site.The Jim Thompson house is a very satisfying couple of hours. The tour guides speak very good English and their knowledge of the man and the house itself is exceptional.The house contains fascinating antiques and images each with their own individual backstory, explained well by the Thai tour guides. You are really given a feel for the place that the unique businessman and individual called home for several years.Overall, the Jim Thompson house is a nice, quiet place to go to see some eye catching antiques away from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok. Although I would stress an interest in history, a love for antiques and beautiful houses is required or else you might find it a little underwhelming"

I\u2019m sure other languages are catered for so don\u2019t feel left out.The main house itself is made up of a number (6?) Thai houses joined together with a bit of a redesign, and is located right on the river/canal. This clearly used to be an entry point for visitors but is now sealed up and there is no obvious quay.You are not allowed to go into the main house without a tour guide and if I recall correctly, you can\u2019t take photos while on the tour. To be honest, the tours are too short and quite perfunctory. I didn\u2019t feel like I had sufficient time to enjoy each room. There are many other rooms in the house which I would love to have taken longer over. Maybe it was because I had arrived in the afternoon and it was busy, but I did feel a bit rushed. It is difficult to take in all the art, sculptures and unique furniture in the 5 odd minutes we had in each room (in some cases less).Outside the main house are several service quarters where the house help used to live. These are now extensions of the museum \u2013 with each showing particular aspects of Jim Thompson\u2019s collection.On the way in/on the way out, there is a little areas where there is some traditional Thai dancing, and also a small (unguided) exhibition as to how to extract the silk from the silk worm, and then put on a yarn.There is also the store and a restaurant. I have been to the Jim Thompson restaurant in Singapore, and if that is anything to go by, this one is probably expensive."

Even as it pops up on TA as a highly recommended destination, the name sounds so blah that we would have passed it by. I'm so glad our concierge recommended this for our last full day in Bangkok. We took our 4 year old twins, and all of us appreciated the gardens and beauty of the home. The tour was a perfect length, and every detail of this house was fascinating. Our children loved the \"mouse house\" in the bedroom, which really captured their imaginations. It was also fun to pick out some Thai Silk souvenirs to take home."

The house is interesting, if you're expecting to learn about silk. It only 20% about silk and 80% of it is about Jim and his passions and commitment put to develop the house. The tour guide mostly explain about the house, Jim's antiquities collection, some history about him and the house. Nevertheless, I enjoy it even though I know the facts is available on Wikipedia. What else better than physically being in the site of historical place isn't? The house is full of architectural fusion with interesting artifacts and antiquities collection of the late Jim. Right next to the Jim's house over the Ratchatavee Pier is the Muslim community of North Bankrua, the old known weaver of Thai silk. The first sample of Thai silk Jim brought to Hollywood comes from them. Jim's old factory or the main supplier is in the community. Hence the reason why he choose to build his house on the estate."

It is very busy but well organised with visitors included in groups of about 10 with a guide to show around and give information in the groups language. We were in an English group and the Thai guide spoke very good English I understand they also have Thai Chinese and Japanese guides. You have to remove your shoes to go inside the houses and also you have to leave your bags in a locker to which you retain the key Small handbags are allowed. You are not allowed to take photographs whilst on the tour which lasts about 35 mins. After the tour you are able to walk around the house alone and walk through the gardens too The admission fee is 150baht and it is money well spent Be aware that there is no a/c in the house with only fans to circulate the air so on a hot day you might feel uncomfortable hot"

Visiting this historical location allows you to take a step back in history (1950's and 60's) when the businessman, Jim Thompson was a member of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS).The architecture, art, and furnishings are along the \"klong\" (canal) where the Thai people made the Thai Silk attire that is known around the world today.There is a great gift shop and nice restaurant located on the property that will bring you to the part of history that was never solved when Jim Thompson traveled to the jungles of Malaysia and disappeared."

The Jim Thompson House is a compound of traditional Thai houses that Mr. Thompson had assembled together on a lovely site. It is furnished with traditional Asian art and antique artifacts and furniture. The tour is incredibly interesting as is the mystery associated with the home. Jim Thompson went on a trip and never returned. No one has ever solved discovered what happened to him. But he was an American, Princeton graduate who fell in love with Thailand and made a great contribution to Thailand's silk industry. There is a charge for the tour but it is well worth the small fee. Gifts and clothing are available for sale in the shop. A warning: Jim Thompson silk clothing is expensive. It is very high quality, made beautifully and the fabrics are incomparable, but this is not for the budget shopper and the styles are very traditional western styles (some are a bit dowdy for my taste). There is a restaurant on site with elegant Thai dishes, a great place to stop for lunch before heading on to your next Bangkok destination though it also has rather touristy prices."

You can either get off the BTS skytrain at Siam or change lines and get off at the National Stadium. Jim Thompson's house is then up a side road on the right, about 5 minutes from the National Stadium station. The cost to get in is fairly reasonable at 150 bhat each (about \u00a36 at current exchange rate). You must go on a guided tour though, you are not permitted to wander about the house on your own. Bags must be put into lockers and you cannot take photographs inside the house. However considering the house is full of priceless antiques and artefacts you can understand why they do not leave people unattended. The tour lasts about 35 minutes and is quite interesting and worth doing just to see inside the house. Group sizes are quite small too and there is a choice of languages - English, French and Chinese.You are allowed to wander around the grounds. There is a nice restaurant and an exhibition hall. There are ladies demonstrating how silk is spun and woven. You can purchase silk items in the shop, they are beautiful but very expensive- scarves were from 1500 bhat upwards (about \u00a335).I would say that this is worth visiting just to see the collection of beautiful antiques. It is fairly commercial and regimented but in a nice way!!! They do have a free Tuk Tuk shuttle to and from the end of the street so if you don't fancy the walk it would be worth looking out for that."

There are Jim Thompson stores all over the city and abroad but few know about the Jim Thompson Outlet Store. It is located on Sukhumvit Soi 93. Three block walk from the BTS Bang Chak station.There are 5 floors of significantly marked down items. The first three floors are silk and cotton fabric and upholstery by the yard. The 4th floor is clothing and the 5th floor is home accessories. Well worth the trip. Great mark downs."

The museum itself is nice enough, though maybe a little sparse on individual items of note, and more a general experience that supports a relatively interesting life story. The guided tour is mandatory, which can be a bother if you get there at the wrong time.There is also an art exhibit above the store, though we forgot to visit it after having a very satisfying and relaxing lunch at the Jim Thompson Restaurant and Wine Bar. The store is also very good for souvenirs at most price levels, though weighted a little more towards the mid-to-high-end.The museum obviously has no AC as an historical building and you have to walk outside briefly at a few points in the tour, so maybe not the best choice in the rain or hottest part of the day. Try to come in before noon and then enjoy a lunch before leaving."

The house is located down a 10 minute side street filled with local rickshaws, local market stands and the most unbearable sunshine heat known to man.You walk into the Jim's front yard and pay 150 BHT to get access to the rest of his beautiful home.You then proceed to the garden where, on the left hand side, is registration for the free tour.The tour explains in detail why some of the artifacts are broken, why you nearly trip over every door ledge, and why you can't wear your shoes indoors.The tour is really insightful and the English-speaking guide is great.His house is beautiful and you really get to see a variety of Thai and Buddhist culture through the eyes of a humble silk trader who did so much for Thailand's silk trade.We were truly fascinated by all we learnt and the whole experience was great.Eat downstairs in the restaurant as the food is amazing but the gift shop is a bit expensive!We love Jim and his story will amaze you!#FindJimThompson"

Additionally, we could not see everything. My wife will kill me but I wanted to see Mr. Thompson's design of the bathroom. He had taken a traditional Thai house and rebuilt it as well as making some modern Western additions. This is interesting to me. He added balconies and we could not see it. All closed. Too bad. For me it was average and I wanted to leave. Oh and the prices for the clothes were rather high. The quality was there but it was a bit much."

Jim Thompson House is located in a nondescript lane off the main road. Thankfully, they provide a complimentary buggy shuttle for ferrying visitors to and from the main road. There is an option to explore the house further by purchasing a ticket worth 150 baht for adults and 100 baht for kids. Those who prefer to just visit the place can hang around and see the white and yellow cocoons. There is a fascinating equipment which shows how the cocoons are boiled over a fire and the yarn extracted from it. When we were there, a young lady was performing a traditional Thai dance to lilting music. The biggest draw is possibly the store with it's unique collection of souvenirs. The scarves and tee shirts are recommended as gifts and they have intricate patterns in bright colors. Some of the adult tee sizes appeared to be geared towards larger built folks versus the average slim built bloke. So please ensure that you try out the outfits prior to purchase. The staff are polite, attentive and more than willing to patiently assist. You can easily spend about an hour here and take shelter if you are caught in a sudden downpour."

The tickets are a bit expensive, but you get a guide who will take you on a tour (with other guests) of the entire compound and inside the house. There are tours for many different language speakers. I learnt a lot about Jim Thompson, the silk industry and also about history. There are many nice pieces to look at, including what was the equivalent to today's TV: a rat box (a box in which rats run around). The guide said this was very \"exciting\" for children back then.I was disappointed, however, that they didn't let us see Jim Thompson's restroom. I think that's the only room that was not shown. Also, you have to take your shoes off to go inside the house, so be prepared. I can imagine that it can be quite busy if there are many groups, so try to go early to avoid the crowd.The restaurant is super expensive, but I didn't eat there so can't comment on the quality and taste."

The tour guides greet you and sets you up on a tour. While we were waiting for the tour we wandered around saw the giant carp, crocodile fish and turtles. The house is an Oasis in the middle of a busy city. The tour takes you round the gardens first followed by the dining room, living room and bedrooms. Nattya was our guide and she was very knowledgable on all the pieces in Jim Thompsons house. The tour lasts about 20/30 minutes but then you can remain in the gardens as long as you wish. There is also a restuarant and gift shop which look lovely and if you've got the money go all out! The tour costs 150 baht each, completley worth it!

While Mr. Thompson collected several traditional homes together to make his house, the traditional architecture still shines, and the tour guides are very good at explaining the construction techniques.Secondly, Jim Thompson revitalized the Thai silk industry through his marketing efforts, and a visit to the House and associated store is a wonderful way to understand what Mr. Thompson did for the silk weavers of Thailand.Lastly, the mystery of his disappearance is fascinating, and be sure to ask your guide what their theory is about what happened...

We only realised on the way back that there is a complimentary tuk tuk from the top of the road that the house is on. Worth it if you are struggling with the Bangkok sun. Once at the house you are assigned a tour guide and taken along with a small group to view the house. The guides are very friendly and informative, whilst we knew nothing about Jim Thompson when we started we certainly did at the end. There is a gift shop selling Thai silk scarfs clothing etc, albeit rather pricey. The cafe is air conditioned, most of the house is not. The house is well worth a visit."

It might be too sterile (too westernized) but i had some pretty bad experiences in Thailand before and now i stick with the popular tourists places only. Really really recommended. And it was really cheap, only 150 baht for adults above 22 and 100 for people under 22."

The restaurant is lovely with good (but overpriced) food. I have purchased several wonderful t-shirts and pillow covers at the elegant store. One can spend at least half a day in this complex. Most recent added feature is two lovely Thai dancers in front of the store. One warning: ignore the guys near the entrance to the street on which the Jim Thompson House is located. Their scam is to tell you that the Jim Thompson House is closed. They propose a different activity instead--one, of course, they'll take you to for a small fee. Not sure what this activity is but I suspect it involves gem shops."

Jim Thompson, an architect, build the Jim Thompson House out of five separate traditional Thai houses which were dismantled in remote spots, transported to Bangkok, and reconstructed. This sounds no so easy nowadays but in the Fifties it was a real challenge, I guess. The plan was to unify traditional Thai culture with western ideas of housing. The plan came together perfectly. My Thai girlfriend did feel like in the old house of her grandmother. Every details fitted. The arrangement of the rooms, kitchen, dining room, living room, study, bath room and sleeping room was like in the west.

Worth a visit if you have some time!"

The guard (?) opened our door when we got off the taxi and then let us to the small booth where we have to pay the entrance fee of THB150. There's a guided tour conducted in the house and you have to tell them in what language you prefer it to be done. Of course, it's English for us. After paying you have to go to another counter where they will brief you on what time your tour is. Ours was at 12:35 PM. It was about 10 minutes before that time so we just sat on one of the benches and waited till they call our group.We started the tour not too long after and first order of business is to leave your bags inside a locker. We only brought our phones with us and the key to the locker. Also, we were told that we're not allowed to take pictures inside the house. Also, once we tour the interior of the house, we have to take off our shoes and leave them in a shelf. It's very organized and educational. Our tour guide (I forgot her name) was very gracious in entertaining questions and it was very interactive. The people in my group really asked her questions about Jim Thompson. Jim Thompson's life is very interesting. Definitely worth getting to know this guy."

My friends and I decided to check out the Jim Thompson house as we had read about his mysterious disappearance in Cameron Highland before. Upon arriving, we were greeted by some traditional dancers who entertained us with a dance and some demonstration on how the silk is woven. We were then ushered into the courtyard where we were given a time for our tour. Pictures are only allowed in the gardens surrounding the house but not in the house itself. On fact you are asked to keep all personnel belongings in a locker before the your begins. The tour itself was very interesting. Our guide was very informative, charming and funny. Overall, we spent around 40 minutes touring the house and learning more about its owner. After the tour, you may visit the silk shop that sells various items such as shirts, handbags and scarfs. The prices are very high end but you can appreciate the quality of the items. Overall, a very nice place to visit and learn about the history of Thai silk and Mr Jim Thompson."

Of course you can find the latest JT collection in a bright modern shop too. The house is easy to reach from the BTS National Stadium. Best to be there before 5pm and ok when raining.

We were guided up the steps to the main house which consists of some rooms, the main hall which we could see from outside, the guest room and Jim Thompson's bedroom. So, what can be said about the rooms except for what are displayed inside, his collection of 'imperfect' antiques. The guided tour was over in 40 minutes. Was I impressed?

We went on the 5pm tour (tours can be in English or French) and our tour guide was lovely and incredibly knowledgeabl. She walked us around the garden first (you can take photos outside but not in the house). Then we were shown around the inside of the house and it's honestly the most beautiful house we have ever seen, built in true Thai tradition. Jim Thompson collected art pieces and statues, one which is over 1,300 years old!! Do not miss this off your itinerary if you are in the city, you wont be disappointed"

The teak wood structures, beautiful furnishings and amazing silk artifacts and native objects really make his home look more like a museum designed for living. The articulate guide gave many interesting back stories about Jim Thompson and how his advocacy for Thai silk created worldwide appreciation for such fine craftsmanship. The grounds are adjacent to a very active local canal where longboat water taxis carry locals and tourists to other areas. We walked to a nearby stop and took a very inexpensive canal ride to the Golden Mountain Temple for more Bangkok adventures."

Guided tours are required but the cost of admission. The tour takes about 30 minutes and our guide was informative. The original pieces in the house - from the teak floors to Burmese statues to Chinese ceramics - are exceptional. The oldest statue in the house is well over 1,000 years old. The gift shop is primarily for high end shoppers, but the Jim Thompson clothing line is well known for its quality. The bathroom facilities are clean and modern, much nicer than many of the main tourist attractions in Bangkok. I highly recommend a visit."

I have long been a fan of Jim Thompson\u2019s elephants and silk scarves, but had not visited his house which is now a museum, until recently. Jim Thompson, an American architect who came to Thailand following completion of his service in the military became known as the American of Thailand. He was responsible for starting the Thai Silk Company. During his 25 years in Thailand, he built the house that is now a museum. There are 6 different structures that came from various parts of Thailand. Constructed mainly of teakwood the house was completed in 1959. The walls are lined with beautiful art work. One of the interesting facts about these homes is the fact that the walls are all slanted/inclined inward, thus giving an illusion of height and providing for good airflow in order to keep the house cool. Jim Thompson taught the Thai people to build their homes on stilts in order to protect against the monsoonal floods that often come each spring and summer. This also prevented evil spirits from entering the homes and kept the home's much cooler due to better air circulation. This home is beautifully maintained. The gardens throughout lend to the forest like nature of the setting. There are illustrations of silk making from the silkworms, a shop with art work, paintings and postcards, as well as a shop with silk apparel and the well-known and whimsical elephants."

His story is mysterious and you might want to read up on it after.The process is that you have to take a tour -- you can't just wander -- and the tour guides have to get each group through the house within a time limit. This means there are many beautiful things that you pass along the way. It's not rushed, and you can ask questions, but it's brisk and directed. The guide was very knowledgeable and pristine-professional. There's a small green garden that you can walk in. A cafe that gets busy at peak lunch time and some little shops selling silk and art books/postcards. They had traditional Thai dancers in the courtyard. Good experience."

The guided tour was well organised and informative; shoes have to be removed and bags left in a locker to which you are given a key. In the courtyard there are ladies giving a demonstration of silk making and cultural dance The restaurant has a good choice of food and drinks and is reasonably priced.Tha same cannot be said for the shop however, the items for sale are very beautiful and rather expensive. Watch out for the little man at the end of the roadway who will try to make you visit another shop, where there is a sale on just for one day, and tell you that Jim Thompson's son sends all the profits from the shop to the USA and Thailand does not benefit at all. The guide informed us that Jim Thompson did not have any children and left his property in trust to the Thai people!"

The tour started at about 5pm, and lasted for about an hour or so. They take you inside the house and give great information on his life. It's quite interesting, especially considering his disappearance. There is one air conditioned room in the house, where the giftshop used to be - so its quite warm in there. Be prepared, wear light, loose clothing. Also, quite a bit of it is outdoors, so be prepared to sweat!One thing of note - before entering the house, you are asked to put all items into a locker. There's a key that you keep with you, but be aware so you may decide to not go with many shopping bags."

The main train from the airport drops you off about a 10 minute walk from here and there's several Skytrain stops nearby, so it's easy to access. Plenty of nice, reasonably priced lodging in the area as well. Once on the peaceful and well maintained grounds you'll forget how close you are to the hectic Siam Square. Everything is well organized, so it's easy to spend your time here efficiently even if you don't have much time (as was the case with us). Overall, time and money well spent."

Tucked away in a small Soi (lane) off the main Sukhumvit Road lies a wonderful surprise; the home of Jim Thompson. I have read up on Jim Thompson and to actually be in his house and understand exactly what he did for the Thai silk industry is truly amazing. The 40 minute or so guided tour, takes you through his house (which is actually six houses from around Thailand and constructed as one) whilst being sublimely educated about Jim, his manner, his aspirations and his unexplained disappearance. This is a very pleasant educational trip, but probably not that interesting for the little ones?: However, they could relay this education back to their teachers and pupils alike back at school."

The museum has the first wood block used to made designs on the silk fabric, and there is an amusing display of the life of the silk worm. A woman was winding the silk threads onto a swift--a fascinating process to watch for me, since I knit, but had no idea how fragile the silk threads really were. Tours of the place are by guide only, and ours was great--made several very funny comments, esp. on the women's indoor toilet facility. A nice gift shop is located on the premises."

But its a really interesting property and look into the lifestyle of a rich white dude with great taste living in Thailand. It's a quick an simple tour, and fun to fantasize living in such a mansion on the river (not so keen on fantasizing peeing in those little fancy chamber pots though...) The best part was the store - you can get pillows and scarves and pocket squares for a fraction of what they would cost in the US ($60 for a Euro Square Pillow Cover? $10 for a Pocket Square?) In retrospect we wish we had purchased more..."

He was a great collector of eastern antiquities in the old style.The museum is essentially his collection housed in the old teak houses he transplanted from the north and rebuilt to a newer design in Bangkok.There is a mix of textiles, wood carving, sculpture and all is displayed well. His very colonial furniture is in place.You go with an appropriate language guide in small groups and the explanations and knowledge were good.The house and gardens themselves are fascinating and some of the sculptures are displayed there.For us this was every bit as worthwhile as the grand Wats and worth taking a tuk tuk to see. It is at the university so handy if you are downtown but otherwise a distance."

He \"westernized\" some aspects for his comfort, but it really is lively. His eye for art was superb - the pieces on display are excellent. The overall compound has been corporatized: there's a westernized Thai restaurant and while the quality is good you do feel you could be at a Disney restaurant. There's an expensive gift shop - really just one of the many Jim Thompson shops you see in Duty Free around Asia. BTW: House has no AC, but shops and restaurant do. You'll need a cool retreat, as one does in Bangkok!"

The building architecture is a fascinating blend of traditional local styles with an unembarrassed nod to Western and American preferences.I was a little uncomfortable at what seemed to be veiled references to the wealthy American seemingly looting local castles and temples for antiquities, including ripping the flooring out of one place to bring it to the compound. It didn't seem wise to inquire too closely.It was easy to imagine the wealthy foreigner restoring prominence to the Thai silk trade and invigorating the local industry and economy. I had the impression Mr Thompson really did love Thailand and the Thai people and his heart was clearly in his new home with them. There's a touch of mystery around his disappearance which was even apparently predicted by the astrologers he consulted for auspicious times to start building and to move in.The guided tour is well rehearsed and informative. You'll learn a lot. Recommended."

The museum is situated in a residential area, by the banks of the river. Entrance fee is 100 baht. The museum opens daily from 9.00 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. with Jim Thompson, an American serving here, decided to devote his energies to develop a thriving Thai silk industry and due to his tireless efforts, Thai silk is now famous all over the world and justly renowned for its quality, colours and patterns. Thompson, trained as an architect and gardener, also built a fine collection of traditional Thai houses where he lived during his lifetime. These house has been shifted from city outskirts and is assembled here to retain the traditional work of Jim Thompson. After his mysterious disappearance, the house remains preserved as a museum containing a priceless collection of Asian objects and arts and belongings of Jim Thompson. There is a guided tour available and a souvenir and silk shop with dress and garments made out of silk for sale. When I visited there was Thai cultural traditional dance performance by Thai artists in the garden with lovely Thai dance moves.."

You can easily do the whole thing in an hour if the wait isn't long for your group to be called. It is not a highlight of the day and you should not prioritize it that way. The house is authentic and represents the period and architecture. The gardens are pretty and very unique. Fair warning though, if you live in America, your house and garden is likely to be bigger than this place. We were a group of two with a private guide and driver. Thankfully, we were able to see it, enjoy it, and move on. There is a restaurant attached and it is somewhat busy.

The tour and history of the house and its previous owner is fascinating and some of the artworks that adorn the house are very impressive. A local Dance Troupe also performed on the day of my visit which was great, and there is a small shop that sells books, silk clothing and accessories and other items. Not hard to get to either, being close to a BTS Train station. I would highly recommend a visit for a couple of hours. :)"

We took the Sky Train (which is SO easy and cheap) and walked to the house, passing Thai food vendors... Oh it looked and smelled so good! On arriving we booked our tour of the house and waited to go through, but this was probably only 10 minutes or so. The gardens are lush and tropical and there is a Jim Thompson shop, as well as Thai dancing and silk spinning, so it's no hardship to wait. The tour is quite lovely and the house and gardens are spectacular! We are going back with friends this Christmas, and we'll be taking them there, as it's not to be missed. It's an intimate tour, and you get a real feeling for the house and the man. We'd decided to book a table at the little casual restaurant within the complex, and so finished off with that. Yum. Fab food and love the Lemongrass & Lychee drinks."

Army in the Far East, fell in love with Thailand and decided to live there permanently. He became interested in and effectively commercialised silk weaving which at the time was a cottage industry.He became very wealthy and built a wooden house in, what is now, the middle of Bangkok. It comprises of six beautiful, traditional Thai buildings into which he added western facilities. It is beautifully furnished and contains a large number of historic artefacts including ancient spiritual statues.Unfortunately, his life came to an abrupt and mysterious end. He disappeared in whilst trekking alone in the Cameron Highlands of Malaysia a few days after his 61st birthday. It is assumed that he was eaten by a tiger because no remains were ever found. He had no wife and so the house is maintained by the government as part of Thailand\u2019s rich artistic and cultural heritage.To find the place, take the MRT to National Stadium (by the famous MBK mall) and it is an easy walk to the house. Just follow the instructions on the signs or watch out for the dedicated Tuk Tuk that will take you to and from the door on 6 Soi Kasemsan 2, Rama 1 Road, Bangkok.Admission to the house is by compulsory guided tour only. Although this limits the time one is able to spend soaking up the atmosphere, the overview by the smartly dressed Thai tour guides is very informative and entertainingThe grounds are open from 9:00 a.m. to 18:00 p.m. every day and here one can see the beautiful gardens and ponds. Also there are displays of Thai dancing and you can see demonstrations silk being \u2018unwound\u2019 from cocoons. Admission costs are a very reasonable 150 baht for adults and 100 Baht for under 22 year olds. The last guided tour starts at 18:00 p.m.Contact information: Tel: (662) 216-7368 Fax: (662) 612-3744"

It's like a little oasis in the middle of the bustling city. His home on stilts on very airy and authentic (read the story of how it came to be here and you'll understand why). His collected artwork is beautiful, and the home is completely furnished, so it gave us some insight into how traditional Thai homes were constructed and filled (albeit for wealthier Thais). The gardens are beautiful as well.The gift shop has a lot of Jim Thompson merchandise, much of which you can see at the Jim Thompson shop in the Central World Mall.Well worth a couple of hours of your time in Bangkok."

Upstairs from the shop is a nice gallery space that had a great sculpture installation when we were there.

To be honest I just went to visit the house as it was down the road from the hotel but it was so worth it! Before stepping inside the house we had to take our shoes off as well as lock our bags away.

The guided tour takes 1/2h and gives you a nice impression of the way Jim Thompson lived in Thailand. The circumstances around his disapperance remains mysterious to date. We visited the place exactly 49 years after his disapperance (26 March). Nice place and restaurant."

Our guide had good English and was informative. Lots of interesting objects dotted around but all are quite worn and falling to pieces! The story of Jim Thompson is more fascinating than the house though in my opinion! We didn't stick around after the tour which lasts around 35 minutes. If you are prone to mosquito bites be sure to get your bug spray on just in case as there is quite a lot of greenery it's better to be safe than sorry! They have commercialised the area some what with a restaurant and souvenir shops but the exteriors are at least in keeping with the original look. There is a free shuttle taking your the short distance to and from the BTS Skytrain every 15 minutes but it's such a short walk, 5-10 mins it's hardly worth it! MBK mall is a 10 min walk from Jim Thompson house with plenty food options on the 6th floor \"foodies\" food court if you are looking for lunch or dinner options or if you just fancy a shop!

It involves climbing and standing in small areas. Interesting story and Jim Thompson continues to live on through a very aggressive merchandising program throughout the area. Some nice purchases can be made in his store."

To that extent they offer a limited range of options but are very good.Must buy some cushion covers, dining table cloths and small accessories.Please try on the shirts etc. As the sizing of different designs is quite varied and it is not unusual the while in one style or cut, a large would be adequate , in another one may need a xxl !"

Feels like an oasis in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of BKK. It has expanded a lot and it feels like it has lost some of it's quaintness and has become very commercial. The house itself is situated off a canal where there is a Muslim community. And in the evening, you can hear the calls to prayer from a nearby Mosque. Pretty cool to hear when in the middle of a city that has 13 million people who are mostly Buddhist."

Incredible story of this American Architect who helped to revive the silk industry in the 60's in Thailand. His disappearance has never been solved and continues to add to the mystery. The house he built in the heart of Bangkok, is a treasure. Antiques from many places in S. E. Asia that were acquired before antiquing was popular fill the house. Visiting this beautiful place gives you a look into the past, before all the big buildings were built up around here and the river was full of garbage! There is a gift store and a nice restaurant where you can have lunch or a snack while waiting for your tour to start. This place is very easy to reach by the Skytrain. It is a short walk. I highly recommend a visit!"

It was the former residence of American businessman Jim Thompson who setup a silk business in Thailand and has now been converted into a museum.The museum is a collection of several traditional Thai houses which the owner had bought and relocated to this compound. The wooden buildings are set amidst extensive gardens located next to a canal. The traditional entrance from the canal has now been blocked and the main entrance is from the road. Some of the buildings are set on stilts and the space below them has been re-purposed to display traditional Thai artifacts.The buildings have been well preserved in their original style and take us back in time showcasing the lifestyle of the owner and his vast collection of traditional Thai silk, art and statues. Unfortunately photography is not allowed in a lot of the buildings housing the most beautiful works.One of the buildings displays the traditional sericulture (silk making) and features a live demonstration of making silk thread using traditional equipment. A building near the entrance houses a restaurant next to a shallow pool.Frequent guided tours are available in Thai and many international languages.The museum provides a glimpse of a foreigner's lifestyle in old Thailand and is definitely worth a visit. Budget at least half a day to fully enjoy the museum and its gardens."

            "review": "A stunning monument to the unique beauty of Thai art and architecture.. A great deal has been written about Jim Thompson by many different people. And yet not one person has ever put Thompson's achievements in the proper historical context. Jim Thompson belonged to an amazing group of American men who did incredibly important work in other countries in the late 1940's and 1950's. During this period General Douglas MacArthur led a social and political revolution that transformed Japan for the better. Western Europe was rebuilt under the Marshall Plan. The American military saved South Korea after it was attacked by North Korean forces. While all of these dramatic events were happening Jim Thompson was quietly resurrecting the silk industry in Thailand. This achievement was, in its own way, tremendously important. The silk industry has become extremely important for Thailand. Over the years it has created tens of thousands of jobs and brought millions of dollars into Thailand. In 1959 Thompson completed his world-famous Thai house. This residence is a magnificent example of traditional Thai architecture. In addition, it is filled with beautiful works of Thai art. These include statues, ceramics, traditional furniture, illustrations, tiles and so much more. It is a one of a kind attraction. You can't see anything like it anywhere else in the world. Jim Thompson had much in common with Douglas MacArthur, George Marshall and other Americans whose accomplishments had such an important impact on other countries in the 1950's. These were all tough, ambitious, talented, principled men who were imbued with the spirit of public service. Their achievements should never be forgotten. The Jim Thompson House is not only a glorious monument to Thai art and architecture, but also to certain important personal qualities that should be cultivated by everyone."

Having no idea of who Jim Thompson was and his contribution to the development of the silk industry in Thailand, it was a truly inspiring story of one man's dedication to Thailand and his unique approach to preserving Thai architecture culture and Asian including Thai antiquities, combining both western and Asian design. A green oasis of Thai structures surrounded by extremely well maintained lush gardens, Jim Thompson House is well worth the visit. Please visitors respect this site; it must be maintained for its contribution to history. It would not be suitable for hordes of buses filled to the brim with tourists to visit as it is quite small and one of the positives about visiting was the intimacy and peace that could be felt by the small group interaction."

You have to put your bags in a locker and take shoes off but no big deal. There's a much smaller version of the store and a nice caf\u00e9. You get to see someone weaving the silk too. It's all near MBK shopping complex too if you need genuine fakes but Jim Thompson stuff is the real thing and it shows."

All the huge, gold, emerald, standing, seated and reclining Buddhas are well worth a visit, of course, but the contrast with such a marvelous, eclectic, and prescient \"designer\" home is a breath of fresh - and stylish - air. Thompson single-handedly resurrected the nearly defunct Thai silk industry back in the late 1950's - 1960's following an unusual trajectory from America to the army in Asia and finally to Bangkok, where he settled at a time when it wasn't so easy tho access. The extraordinary house he created is a love-letter to Thai culture, cobbled from an assortment of old, traditional wood homes and filled with an exceptional collection of Asian and European antiques, many of which are museum-quality. For anyone even vaguely interested in design or architecture this is a must-see, a truly unique home now emulated all over the world - Thompson was way, way ahead of his time. This is an \"insider\" stop, with noticeably sophisticated tourists making pilgrimages to a famous temple of style not on the typical Bangkok itinerary - another reason it's so special. Many just stop by to visit the beautiful store on the premises, though the big 4-story emporium elsewhere in the city is the place to immerse yourself in truly fabulous items - easily accessed from the Sky Train. Tickets are required but can be bought on the spot, and there are guided tours only, starting every 20 minutes or so to control the numbers. Don't miss it. You'll hate yourself later."

On the right hand side they got a Thai restaurant as well. This property used to belong to Mr. Jim Thompson who disappeared somewhere in Malaysia. Local guides by languages are well trained and give good information to us. The tour took around 45 minutes approximately. After the tour we had lunch options at 6th floor food court of MBK.

The dark moody wood interior and furniture accented by the silks and native art pieces made the rooms stunning and somewhat cold. It's felt like a stage set at times. What warmed it up for me was the landscaping around the home...nothing like nature as the great equalizer. What I loved about this place was how it's hidden amidst the urbanity of the city. Malls, busy roads, people and then you turn the corner and a piece of nirvana...stop by for a breather from the chaos."

Jim Thompson House is one of those travelling-delights that you stumble upon from time to time.Having visited BKK numerous times I had never been here. What a great surprise and what a great great man. He is to Bangkok what Robert Louis Stevenson is to Samoa.An amazing house that when you step into from the manic Bangkok craziness you are instantly transported to another time and place. Go discover for yourself!! It's an highlight."

The guided tour introduces visitors to salient aspects of Thai architecture; however, I read about it and watched tourists' videos prior to travel so I took away much from the visit unlike fellow tour mates who were wondering about many details. The collection of Southeast Asian art is not museum-grade; instead, it is an unpretentious reflection of what a genuine lover of Asian culture surrounded himself with. Tip: Some items are cheaper at the DFS Jim Thompson store at the Suvarnabhumi airport."

The gardens were very nice. The residence is connected to a silk store, which was the business the Mr. Thompson was in. The intriguing part of the story was that Mr. Thompson disappeared in the jungle and was never found. The tour guide spoke excellent English and was very informative. Nice little tourist spot."

To be honest, I'd never heard of Jim Thompson before arrival in Bangkok and even then I only noticed it en passant in the 'places to visit' list and hadn't really expected to visit. Anyhow, my sense of direction failed several times around Siam to the point that we were about to jump back on good old Skytrain and give the day up to prepare for the evening's entertainment but I had one last look at the map and lo and behold, I noticed JT's house was only a relatively short distance away. Even so, we elected to take a taxi (an experience in itself involving driving the wrong way down the main road....) and arrived in 'fight or flight' mode, well pumped! But at least a bit less footsore....As soon as we alighted we were hit by an overwhelming sense of peace and greenery - a tranquil oasis if you will - with Thai dancing, silk cocoon spinning, birds and canals! Tickets were very reasonably priced and included mandatory accompanied tours in many languages (one language per tour obviously) and if I had to make any criticism it would be that the tours are rather quick and it's difficult to hear and take in all the info. After the tour you're free to wander around the site and study in a bit more depth, have a snack in the cafe and admire the clothes / bags etc on sale. Didn't buy anything as a bit expensive for me but you have to say the items are spot-on!"

Rare examples of traditional Thai housing, furnished with Thompson's collection of Thai and SE Asian art and furniture - as well as some of his own designs give insight into the man's lifestyle, values and influence. Arrive early though as the queue for the compulsory tours can be very long. We arrived at midday, and with the line reaching to the street, decided to stay just for lunch. And the lunch was really delicious. Next morning we returned at opening time when there was hardly anyone there. The tour was really worthwhile, with our guide providing interesting information, anecdotes and clear explanations. A lovely day out."

This house and the surrounding gardens are so peaceful that it's hard to believe you're just a few blocks from the bustling commercial center of the city. Jim Thompson certainly was a man of vision (excellent taste, too) and it's well worth the time and money to hear his legend and see what he created. One tip -- remember the house is on Soi Kasem 2, which is away from the shopping area as you get off the train at National Stadium. Soi Kasem 1 does not connect, so if you make a wrong turn, you'll be doing a lot of walking."

And it did - it was short and sweet. The tours are short and last less than an hour, but they are very well organized by the staff there. I had my tour in English, and I thought my tour guide's English was well trained. I liked being able to see the artifacts and remnants of a past Thai cultural enthusiast. The tour guide also explained some of the artifacts' purposes and design meanings. I would recommend going early so that you can catch the first tour in your appropriate language and then go on about your day (this is what I did.) I feel like if you go in the middle of the day, you might end up waiting a while for the next tour in the language you want and then you may feel restless about the time you're spending there. So to avoid this, I would arrive early! I also purchased a zodiac guide in their small bookstore adjacent to their reception desk. It made a great souvenir gift. I wouldn't say the experience was exceptional and spectacular, but it was interesting and worthwhile. If you have some time in Thailand, I would recommend. If you only have a few days, maybe not so much."

It's fairly small and there isn't all that much to see, but it's well worth a visit nonetheless as it presents a fascinating window into a Thai culture and history through the lens of a foreigner who made the country his home.There are regular tours in several languages carried out by well trained guides. Lockers are available for your possessions, as are foot lockers for shoes (taken off during the indoor segments of the tour). The tour is carried out in a very professional and informative manner, highlighting the idiosyncrasies of the buildings and key differences from traditional Thai homes. Surprisingly, there isn't too much to see that relates to the silk industry that Thompson kick started.The grounds are beautiful and very well maintained, and it's worth wandering around before or after the tour at your own speed, most of the grounds are accessible. It's definitely worth committing a couple of hours for this if you are visiting the MBK mall, which is within walking distance (be aware that the house is some way down the soi it's on, though they do provide free tuk tuk shuttles to get back to the main road)."

The guides are excellent and the story is really interesting (although somewhat safe compared to the unofficial story) but it's true he did a lot for the country in getting the silk trade up and going after the war. There's also a store with Jim Thompson books etc as well as the larger retail store with silk products (scarves, pillows, clothes, handbags etc) and it's not cheap by local Thai standards. There's a chain of JT stores, incl the international airport so you won't miss out if you don't get anything on the day. There's also a restaurant on site which is fine but again at tourist prices and the menu hadn't changed in the 7 months since my last visit.

A VISIT to Jim Thompson\u2019s House is a must to appreciate his importance to Thailand for revitalising Thai silk and showcasing it to the world.Thompson\u2019s mysterious disappearance while on a visit to Malaysia in 1967 has never been explained and his body has never been found, but visitors can tour his home in Bangkok and gain some insight into the man, his business and how it developed.The house itself is actually a combination of six traditional Thai homes that Thompson had brought in and skilfully combined.Entry costs 150 baht or about \u00a33 and your whole visit is well organised through a guide system, visitors being asked to wait in a central area until their number and letter are called and they can step forward to begin a tour of the house with their selected guide.My tour began in dramatic fashion with a huge cloudburst which forced our guide to issue umbrellas so we could get across a little courtyard to the start of the house tour. The rain was so heavy it was actually bouncing off the ground!Shoes are taken off and backpacks left behind in lockers before you get taken up this staircase, down that corridor and into a variety of rooms to see everything from porcelain \u2013 Thompson was a great collector of antiques \u2013 to beds, statues, furniture and paintings.Some of the exhibits are priceless and the house is set in a lovely garden near a klong or canalway which, at one point during my visit, had a large boat cruise through setting up an aftermath of huge waves.It was a very enjoyable and informative hour while the site includes a tourist point which is very helpful, toilets which are clean and well kept and there are even koi carp cruising a pond to enjoy. Excellent value for the entry fee.The quality of the gifts available, as you might expect, is very high. The main shop is air conditioned which was very welcome while a subsidiary shop offered a highly unusual chance to walk away with a sheet of heavy duty paper with your horoscope on it, definitely an unusual memento and it only cost 100 baht or \u00a32.An interesting and absorbing attraction where a couple of hours flew by before you realised it. Well worth a visit."

For only 150 baht you get to explore the gardens (which are breathtaking) and the unique house that Jim Thompson put together. As a fan of architecture, it was really interesting to see how he respected Thai architecture and culture while blending it with the elements of a western home, and the tour guide is great and points all these things out to you. The gift shops offer some really great souvenirs and some beautiful silks. I highly recommend spending a couple hours here."

The architecture of the house itself is functional but not spectacular. The furnitures and fixtures are not museum grade, but they are very nicely selected and presented. So at the end of the guided house tour, one does get some sense of how life was decades ago when Jim Thompson lived there. Our tour guide was proficient but looked like she was just going through the motions. After all, it seems that the house is there mostly to promote the vast silk business in the name of Jim Thompson."

At the time of his disappearance he was one of the most famous Americans living in Asia. His house is well preserved and worth a visit to get an insight into the traditional thai houses and the way silk was made in the old times."

If you use the sky train (National Stadium Station) as your transportation, look for the courtesy vehicles that will give you a free lift to the compound and return you to the sky train after your visit. If you don't see them, the walk up the alley isn't too far, but Bangkok is hot. Jim Thompson had amassed a large collection of asian art and the Thai government has done a great job of operating this museum."

Thompson also collected parts of various derelict Thai homes and had them reassembled in their current location in 1959.

This was a good one. Jim Thompson was an ex-pat who had been in Thailand in the 1940's. He returned and got the locals to revive the cottage industry of silk production. He built his home from several traditional Thai houses that he had moved to Bangkok from the countryside. They have tours of the home, a restaurant and an extensive selection of high end silk items for purchase. Tours are about 1/2 hour in duration."

Also other western style designs are visible. E.g. sofas, tables and chairs.Few items are rare and old, e.g. old Buddha statue from Ayutthaya.Dont expect the guides telling any details about Thompsons CIA-background or political intrests.Outside it was very interesting to observe the traditional way of silk spinning. Also there was a short traditional dance show.In Suan Pakkad there are far less people and you really can relax in the garden. Jim Thompson was too crowded to my taste and offered no inviting place to sit and relax.

Go down the steps, immediate left and then a right when you see another signpost. Total about 10mins walk. The tour is compulsory and included in the 150 entrance. I had to wait about 10mins for the next English speaking one. Guides are friendly and informative. You can not take photos inside the house just in the gardens. On site there is also shop and cafe. There is information about silk making and also got to see a woman demonstrating the traditional process. Upstairs there is an art exhibition that I think changes every few months. A nice extra included."

This old Thai style home, formerly owned and occupied by Jim Thompson, American silk entrepeneur and alleged spy, is a must see for anyone interested on American influence and politics in Asia in mid-20th century and those interested in Thai art and architecture. The entrance to the house and the tour confused me and i have to admit i saw the house last year. Due to a misunderstanding I was not able to visit it again this year. I and my elderly mother paid our entry fee, about 150 baht each. She walks with a cane and the ticket seller said we had to wait for an hour for the next tour. I said my mother might be fatigued by then. She told us to look around the garden and if Mom was too tired for the tour we should come back for a refund. We shopped for a while and rested on a bench for an hour then went to line up for the tour. But we were told we had not signed up and had to wait another hour. I told the manager that the ticket seller did not tell us we had to sign up. Our tickets were stamped with the time of our entry and proved we had waited an hour. She marched us over to the ticket sellers and asked me to identify the one who had told me that. I could not pick the one of 3 who were selling, so quite rudely and ignoring my elderly mother with a cane, told us we could not tour until later. We got a refund and left. My mother would have had to miss part of the tour due to stairs but she was willing to walk as much as she could. Jim Thompson house is beautiful with its gardens, canal setting and artwork, but make sure you walk the 50 feet from the ticket sellers to the tour sign up and line up. There is a cafe and gift shop, both pricey but not mandatory."

The courtyard is lovely, there is a restaurant, the tour of the house is historically interesting and the perfect amount of time, there is a shop selling silk clothing, a contemporary art space that regularly rotates exhibits (this part is free!), and demonstrations in Thai dancing and silk making. Also, the house, furniture, decorations, etc. are BEAUTIFUL and serene. Consider stopping here to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Siam area.

A different side of Bangkok which will definitely enrich your tour."

The tour guides (English, French, Mandarin, Japanese and Thai), which are a must in order to enter the building comes together with the 150baht price. The guides are truly exceptional (at least mine was. Her name was Pang) and even crack jokes to make the group lighten up. Be sure to ask a lot of questions and they are ready to answer.The houses are truly beautiful and some artifacts and statues come from as far back as 200 years ago! Truly wonderful place and it makes you wonder what happened to Jim Thompson while on his trip to Cameron Highlands. Outside, you can see craftsmen making silk out of silkworm coccoons!"

Would have to rate this one of the best informative tours we have done on our travels around Asia.Never really knew who Jim Thompson was until visiting this place. His story comes across as though he was a visionary before his time. The location, design and layout of the buildings/property isn't really understood until you hear the story for yourself. The architecture of the main house, the servants quarters, the statues and art collections, the silk weaving and just the mystery of his disappearance make this a most intriguing place to visit.Highly recommend this tour to all.There is a free shuttle you can catch form the main street to save you a few hundred metres of walking down the narrow laneway to get there."

Business man who lived in Thailand and helped advance their silk industry. Entrance fee is 150 baht. The price includes a guided tour which is nice, but in the end what you end up doing is visiting his house room by room. It is interesting to see the house contents and the mans story, but the experience is less than satisfying mainly because it is not very relevant to Thailand's history and most importantly it does not speak a word about the making of silk! Apart from some women demonstrating silently the extraction of silk at the entrance and the very expensive silk shop at the exit, this experience will not satisfy your curiosity of information about Thai silk production is what you are after."

The estate includes a huge gift shop, restaurant, gallery, bar, event space, and of course the home. The wait was around an hour, and it seems like that is done to encourage some ancillary spending, but the other amenities allow you to kill time without being bored. The tour itself was quite interesting, but perhaps a bit rushed to allow for more people to be shuffled through the property. Expect to take your shoes off before you enter, so best not to wear your most expensive shoes and bring socks if you don't like walking barefoot."

Guided tours take you through the 6 houses in a single compound, all assembled from teak wood mansions some afar as Ayutthaya. Jim Thompson had an extensive collection of various artefacts including rare ones of the Buddha that are displayed throughout the complex. Graceful Thai dancers and a man weaving silk from cocoons near the entrance pleasantly divert your mind from the delay in the next guided tour. JTH is a really short walk away from the National Stadium BTS where if it is too sunny, a free shuttle tuk-tuk takes you from the Rama I road to the JTH and back again.You can also come to JTH by the canal boat and hop off at Saphan Hua Chang. The MBK mall is a few minutes walk from JTH."

Whilst the house itself is beautiful to look at and some of the furnishings lovely, the whole visit was underwhelming. The compulsory tour was quite boring, our guide was difficult to understand and spoke little of how JT reformed the silk trade and spent more of the tour taking about his possessions. An experience that is ok to miss!"

There'll be a seem-to-be friendly guy trying to persuade you to go to a shop that sells jewellry or whatsover that are on sales (hah....365-day sales).He/She will stand in front of a FEMALE dormitory, and will fabricate a story that he/she lives there. Liars. It's an old, small dorm that the owner reserves only for students who study in the most pretigious high school in the city.I've seen so many foreigners with good hearts getting ripped off...and I couldn't say a thing or help because there're so many of them around and I don't want to get hurt/blackmailed. If you stop and talk to him/her (most of the time it's a he) more than a minute, congrats....afterwards you'll get stalked for more than 500 m by their gang.The Government has warned tourists thousand times not to believe these people, yet I've seen so many victims... Please don't let them take advantage of your naivity or friendliness. I'm sorry for not being brave enough to warn you right there.If you want to get a genuine Thai silk/jewellry, never to such shops."

Also his death and the prediction of his date of dying. My advice is to read a little bit about him prior to visiting. There is a gift shop there that will sell books on his life and worth purchasing at least one whilst admiring the shops display of silk."

Their is a cafe/restaurant (overly priced average food to be honest) and a shop which sells a lot of hand make silk clothing etc...again, very expensive but the items for sale are stunning!!

The admission fee has gone up to 150 Baht and there is a short wait to get on a tour. Once you have bought your ticket, go directly to where you're directed to book a time slot. Most tours are in English though, if you're prepared to wait a while, other languages are available. We noticed another guide who spoke French very well.As well as the house, the other facilities are of a high standard. We were delighted to see a display of traditional Thai dancing by a couple of very skilled and elegant young women. The shop is nice too but, with the sky-high prices, we noticed many people looking and very few buying!Don't bother with a taxi to Jim Thompson house if you have easy access to the BTS Skytrain system.

When Jim Thompson went missing in the Cameron Highlands of Malaysia, the mystique was assured. The tour itself is a well choreographed homage to the man who reputedly \"single-handedly revitalized the Thai silk industry.\" The house itself is a collage of six traditional Thai houses with some interesting architectural modifications. What is most interesting to me, however, is the authorized version of the history of Jim Thompson - and the almost complete lack of personality the man left behind in the house. Someone has done an excellent job of creating the legend behind the brand. There is a very nice cafe attached to the house, which serves up refreshing drinks and good food. Although the tour guide was at pains to tell us that the Jim Thompson House is a museum foundation separate from the silk shop, there is a store outlet on the premises - all very beautiful and accordingly priced articles. For me the best part of the visit is that you are in central Bangkok, yet a five minute walk up a soi gets you away from the bustle of the city. A golf cart will take you up the soi if you are mobility reduced; simply wait at the end of the soi and a cart will come along shortly. Access from National Stadium BTS station."

As others have said you can only tour the house with a guide, so have a good look as you won't be able to go back and wander by yourself. Our guide had good English, but spoke very fast which I found hard to follow at times. ( I am English speaking!!). The gardens are lovely with many water features which can be photographed - no photos inside the house. There are demonstrations of silk harvesting from the silkworm cocoons and of silk weaving.The retail outlet was beautiful but expensive. The restaurant served lovely refreshments. There is a courtesy tuk tuk to take you back to the main road. I'd recommend a visit while you're in Bangkok as this could be the only place you will see a 'gracious' Thai stye house."

Jim Thompson was an American citizen that established a very successful silk business in Thailand, contributing to rebuilding the industry in the country and creating international demand for it. Today's museum is hosted in what was his private house, a cluster of traditional teak and theng buildings that he got relocated from Ayutthaya. The house in itself, the pond and the garden are worth a visit; inside it is a showcase of his art pieces and silk garments. Spend some time to have a look at the store: blankets, scarves, ties and pillows are really good value for money. And the restaurant is very good as well."

The house is as he left it when he disappeared in 1967. They don't let you take pictures inside the house, which is my only complaint. The 30 min tour is excellent though. Great hand made silk products in gift shop are a perfect gift or souvenir and take time to eat at the restaurant, it's very good. Next to a BTS station too."

Jim Thompson House is actually a small compound of several buildings in a tropical setting on a khlong. Jim Thompson made his fortune by taking Thai batik to the world. He built this compound as his home and personal retreat from the heat and noise of the city. Thompson bought several traditional wooden Thai homes and arranged them in a garden with breezeways connecting them. The interiors are decorated with historic pieces representing Thai culture and values. There is a nice restaurant for lunch as well as an outlet that sells Thompson batik.

Our english speaking tour guide (included in the price) was lovely and very informative. The rooms were interesting and she explained Jim Thompson's involvement with the silk industry as well as telling us about the antiques he collected and kept in his house. I wish there had been more information on silk textiles, or perhaps an exhibition involving the craftspeople who sat outside the house spinning silk. The cafe was nice and cool and the food was reasonably priced and very good.

By the time it did several coach tours had arrived that went straight in so instead of the relatively quiet tour we'd hoped for and could have received when we arrived it was crowded and noisy. Other than that we had a nice visit. If you want to miss the crowds though you'll need to start your tour before 10.00.

Here visitors can go back in time and see the house's history and functionality. Available also are drinks and snacks in the garden, silk and gift shops as well as traditional dance and music shows. My favorite part of the visit however, is simply walking around the compound and learning snippets of Thai history and imagining what it would have been like to be a guest at one of Jim Thompson's renowned parties."

An American who settled in Bangkok, he built his own house out of six traditional buildings brought in from the country side - the oddest being two hundred years old. Crammed with antiques, the home is a model of style and elegance and you can imagine him entertaining the likes of Robert Kennedy and Somerset Maughan. The small garden is an oasis in bustling BK. It costs 150 baht (\u00a33) to enter and you are taken n a tour (English and French spoken) which lasts for 40 minutes. You can then explore the out buildings and gallery at leisure. There is a Jim Thompson shop at western prices - over 30 for a printed silk tie. But the quality is outstanding. A free shuttle takes visitors to and from National Stadium skytrain station. Try a boat on a klong to go on (Pratunam 14 baht). It runs from the bottom of the garden."

I first went to this charming house on the klong 23 years ago when it was dead simple, a bit run down and much more true to form. The restaurant, conference room, shop and general touristy over-exploitation have a purpose, to pay for the upkeep and make the foundation viable, but they all detract from the original charm and purpose of this amazing house. You get a sense that Thompson just stepped out for a bowl of noodles, when standing in his austere bedroom or at his simple writing desk. The salon is still glorious and the dining table, made of two mahjong table antiques, is set with great style. Pity about the commercialism, the crowds on any given day and the annoying tourist touts in the lane. Bangkok is sullied by this kind of parasitic preying on hapless tourists. The no-photography ban is risible, but it is easy to pinch shots without the useless guards noticing."

Jim Thompson is an intriguing, complex character. It frequently seems to be the case that it takes a foreigner to understand the uniqueness of a country's art, culture, and history. The restaurant is top-notch Thai food-while adjusted to the non-Thai's taste (i.e. not tons of fish sauce). It was one of my favorite places to enjoy a meal by the peaceful koi ponds. The staff were always attentive and crazy about our young kids!! We felt like celebrities whenever we visited--which was six times in 1 1/2 years!! Each visit I learned something new. One of the experiences I miss most about Bangkok : )"

If you don't want to catch the ferry, you can catch the BTS to National Stadium station. It is compulsory to go around the house on a tour. The tours start every 20mins or so and are offered in English, French, Chinese, Japanese and Thai. While you wait you are allowed to walk around the grounds and visit the shop. They had a man demonstrating the way the silk threads are pulled from the cocoon as well as a woman doing traditional Thai dancing so we had plenty to do while we waited. The tour itself took about 35mins and was very informative. We learnt about the life of Jim Thompson, his business, the house and a bit of Thai culture as well. We really enjoyed the experience and if you are in the fashion or decorating industries you will find it especially interesting and relevant. "

So wny not take a break, yet you can still shop and eat here and see something very nice from just the last century. Jim Thompson was born in Delaware in 1906. An architect and art lover by trade. He ended up in Thailand as WW2 ended. He fell in love with Thailand and collected ancient art. He created this teak house on a canal in central Bangkok in the 1950s out of old houses he bought and parts of homes, windows and doors to make a beautiful house, authentic Thai in most ways, but with a few western features, most important was the indoor toilet. The house was completed in 1959, and he disappeared in Malaysia when he went for a walk in 1967 and was never found. Entry is 150 Bhat for adults. You must check your bags in a locker. This includes purses. You can take pictures in the gardens and from the outside but NOT inside the house. Group tours leave about every 5 minutes if it is busy and last 35 min. They put about 14 max in a group. Once you get your ticket walk back and they will assign you a time by the garden. If not that busy you should get a tour right away. If busy it might be a short wait but the gardens are nice to pass your time and there is a book shop and a silk shop. They also had silk weaving demonstrations and some Thai dance to watch while you wait or after your tour.  There is a restaurant too that looked good. Take the BTS to National Stadium exit and turn left and just a block you will see a sign for a right turn to Jim Thompson house. Its probably a 3 minute walk from the station, very easy! The house went to Jims Nephew in the USA, but it was then transferred to a trust who does an excellent job of managing the property. They make money in the shops and even a Jim Thompson line of bags and clothing now!"

A number of staffs who can speak many languages very fluently will explain the details about the house, history of Jim Thompson, tradition and culture of Thailand. Each and every piece of the house has interesting history and tradition. You should see it!And there is also a book store beside the reception and you can observe the mystery of Jim Thompson, interesting Thailand Horoscope and many souvenirs.Moreover, opposite to the ticket office, there is a building. In the upper floor, there is an exhibition of GOLDEN TEAR (DROP) PROJECT. It's just a place of showing the photos and videos. May be it has some history and I don't know yet. In the ground floor, there is a store where Jim Thompson brand are sole. VERY EXPENSIVE!!!There is also a restaurant in there. Foods are pricey and taste is good. If you want to use the public transportation, I'd like to recommend to use BTS sky train and ride to the National Stadium (the last terminal of Silom Line). There is also a shuttle service from the National Stadium to Jim Thompson house and vice versa. Of course, it is FREE!.Last but not least, if you arrive Jim Thompson House, before you go with their TOUR, when you look around the house, DON't put your hands in the lake and pots.

With the concrete jungle surrounding you this is a fascinating place in which to gain just a small snap shot of old Thailand. It's very easy to get to and only 400 meters from the stadium MRT station. It's well priced but you do have to go on a guided tour which probably makes sense, about forty minutes but it's so fascinating. It's all original and beautifully maintained with many treasures inside so a real experience to see how these houses were constructed, decorated and lived in. There is also a very good restaurant and shop selling expensive silk products for which he is famous, perhaps a little over the top on price? However I'm glad we finally made it here and thoroughly recommend it."

The estate itself is quaint yet sturdily made. A lot of love seemed to have gone into the details of creating this house and its surrounding gardens; it would definitely be a very comfortable and beautiful place to live in.The grounds also include a museum on the upper floor (which my boyfriend and I very much enjoyed; it was free to go in) as well as a gift shop and a dining place. Things looked pricey though so we didn't bother buying anything.Bangkok's grand temples define the proud history and culture of this city, yet the Jim Thompson House is well worth a glimpse into the past.

I appreciate that Thais preserve the place so well and take very good care of it. Also, it's interesting to see how rich used to live around mid 1900's in Thailand. Mr Thompson's personal collection of antiques was beautiful.However, I'd appreciate more info about Mr Thompson himself, processing silk etc. The tour was too short for my liking.Gift shop had some nice items but the material used in majority of the objects was not even silk and the prices were ridiculously high. I had lemongrass drink in their cafe which was basically nothing but water with lots of ice and slight lemongrass aroma."

The house was built by Jim Thompson who unfortunately disappeared in the late '70s and has since been preserved and converted into a heritage tour of sorts by Thailand tourism. Full credits to them for maintaining the house as is, preserving the artefacts (which are a lot) and glorifying each aspect of Mr. Thompson's existence in their culture and history. The house in itself is very vast, very Thai in architecture and open to tourists 6 days a week. There's a guided tour every 10 minutes with an English or French speaking guide, who will take you to the important parts of the house and explain in detail its importance. Every nook of the house has a part of Thai culture embedded in it. It's fascinating because Mr. Thompson himself was not Thai but adopted the land as his when he visited. There's a Thompson boutique that sells amazing silk bags and clothes for a slightly steep price and a Thompson restaurant on the premises that serves good food and alcohol at decent rates! Visit it if you're interested in seeing preserved history in its untouched form. Worth your while and a touristy checklist when in Bangkok."

The historic Jim Thomson House is both a sales outlet for the famous silk product range as well as being a wonderful \"museum\" providing a glimpse of the lifestyle in Bangkok in the early 20th century. Wandering around the gardens is also very pleasant (although it can be very warm to hot depending on time of year). I first saw this property only a few years ago even though I have lived in Bangkok for over 20 years. I had heard of it before, but had not visited, so I was very pleasantly surprised when I got there. It is certainly worth a visit, and perhaps pick up a nice silk product while you are there. I bought a silk scarf for my mother, and a few other things for family members overseas - not expensive either."

Jim Thomson, American, was originally stationed in Asia with the infamous OSS (CIA) for World War II missions and fell in love with Thailand so stayed and established a traditional Thai silk industry. He built his house on the river in the Muslim Quarter to grow silkworms and produce world class silk. The house and interior are fabulous with highly knowledgeable guides who explain the stories of him and the history. Best accessed by BTS from Siam to National Stadium and 5 mins walk."

The buildings were unique compared to much of what we had seen, and the grounds were well maintained also. We ate at the restaurant, and the food was actually very good (and coming from someone who doesn't generally like food at tourist spots). I recommend this to people visiting Bangkok for something different, but probably not a place to bring kids. The location is somewhat hidden, but there were a couple of signs hanging on nearby street poles to help guide you there. And, there is a shuttle from the main road, that takes you the two blocks to the property. You can probably also catch the public transport as it is right along the main road where the cab dropped us off, if you don't mind walking a third of a mile roughly."

A tour of Jim Thompson's house was on that list of things to do. The information given on the tour wasn't intersting and the house itself isn't anything out of the ordinary. A definite skip if you are short on time while traveling. If you are interested in purchasing Jim Thompson quality silk gifts, there is an outlet shop that you can find directions to online located near one of the BTS Sky train stations, which will save you a lot of money and has a wider selection of goods."

The guides are friendly and knowledgeable, ensuring that you will leave the house with a better understanding of Thailand and the silk industry.

The restaurant is great if you go and the shop actually is not as good as their store in the Siam Shopping Center. The first time i bought a Jim Thompson silk shirt I shocked at the sticker price and bought one. Later I noticed the amazing craftsmanship plus it is a comfortable and lightweight shirt for hot and humid climates. My next trip back I bought five more. I think I own about 12 shirts now counting the two I bought this last trip. I am really sold on their clothes. The house tour is great. You can sometimes see Thai dancers there in costume. The history and mystery of Jim Thompson is captivating."

You are not going to get good silk cheap at any time but I think other items are overpriced because of the association with Jim Thompson.

A must see for any visitor who is interested in the arts and culture of South East Asia and Thailand in particular.With his Architectual background, Jim Thompson put an amazing selection of traditional Thai teak houses together and filled it with traditional art and antiques of the region.His mysterious disappearance in the early 70s adds even more interest to this legacy.Today it's an oasis of calm with beautifully kept gardens and charming staff to make sure your visit is most memorable. No double pricing for foreigners either. 150 baht admission; a bargain !! Photography inside the house is not permitted.Also try the small restaurant by the pond next to the house ........ Enjoy !!An easy way to get to the Jim Thompson house is to take the BTS Sky Train to \"National Stadium\", from there walk, about 350 mtrs. A courtesy vehicle from the JT house also operates from under the BTS station. The house is virtually in the Soi next to the station on the north side, direction of the canal (San Seap)As a side note, don't let taxi and tuk- tuk touts distract you when you walk up to the end of the small Soi to get to the house. \"Oh.. were you go ? Jim Thompson closed today\". Don't believe them !! They want to take you shopping in High pressured sales shops, from which they get commission for bringing you there.... The Jim Thompson house is always open 365 days a year apart from perhaps Songkraan festival...."

The inside of the house is nice with some beautiful pieces of Thai art and Buddhas and we found it interesting and enjoyable to see. On entering the grounds there are people pulling the silk from the cocoons and how they process the silk from the cocoons before weaving it. I have never seen this before and found it also quiet interesting. There were also some women in traditional Thai dress doing some traditional Thai dancing. We enjoyed this quiet, aesthetic attraction although it might not be everyone's cup of tea. There is a gift shop there with some nice silk clothes, and scarves etc that could probably be bought elsewhere for less money. There is also a nice restaurant and bar with good, but a bit pricey food overlooking the house and grounds and a pool with large gold fish in it. We enjoyed having a smoothie and a snack there. The larger meals looked quite good. A quiet peaceful artistic attraction."

Our English language group (tours are also available in Thai, French, Japanese and Chinese) numbered 15, which was too big for the spaces visited (12 would be better). The guided tour told me nothing that I hadn't already read on Wikitravel or in the Insights/Lonely Planet Guide Book, but the English was good.The tour would last, 45 minutes (it actually lasted 33 minutes) and we were tripping over the group in front of us and half listening to the group behind as groups came very close together.The house itself is lovely and the antiques are stunning. After the tour (during the \"inside the house\" part you must lock your bags in a locker and remove your shoes) you're free to walk around the garden and into some smaller buildings, where further - unlabelled - antiques are displayed. You can take photos of these and photos in the garden, but not in the house.There were also displays of silk spinning and weaving."

The entrance fee is affordable and you then get a guided tour around the house and gardens. It is well done and offers a glimpse of life for the well-healed foreigner in Thailand in the 50s and 60s.There is also an art gallery with interesting videos, an up-market shop selling rather nice but expensive silk and wool products and a cafe/restaurant which is well worth visiting.Wheelchair access to the house would be impossible but more or less OK for shop, restaurant and gardens.The site is easy to get to from the canal ferries but don't fall in en route!

We went for an iced coffee at the restaurant which was lovely overlooking the house and a lily pond. At the end of our trip we were back in Bangkok before flying home and decided to have lunch at the restaurant. The food was excellent and it was peaceful and restful before braving the trip to the airport."

Jim Thompson's house was beautiful, and the collection of art even better. The tour guide did a great job relating significant facts about JT's life and construction techniques on this most interesting house. There were also some interesting shows going on right before you get to the start of the tour. Beware people standing outside JT's house telling you that the house is closed and offering to give you a bargain tour somewhere else and that tour would not be a bargain."

Made it hard to hear the guide.Do visit - it is very near National Stadium BTS and there are tuktuk shuttles (it is far down the soi)."

In the 1940s and 50s, US citizen Jim Thompson was instrumental in creating an international demand for Thai silk, and his preserved house in Bangkok is a fascinating place to visit, even if you have no interest in the textile trade.Located down a quiet backstreet, the Jim Thompson House is peaceful, beautifully maintained, and packed with interesting objects its globetrotting owner collected during his lifetime. Tours of the house are conducted by local guides who speak impeccable English, know the history of the building inside out, and are more than happy to answer questions. I felt like I learned a lot while exploring the House, and the guides helped me to make sense of objects and statues I'd spotted in other tourist sites around Bangkok.After the tour guests are free to wander around the outdoor areas of the house, and admire a collection of monster koi carp. There's also a large souvenir shop where you can buy silk \u2013\u00a0but as I have no interest in textiles, I didn't even browse the items on offer.In a city as busy and exhilarating as Bangkok, the Jim Thompson House offers a brief respite from the relentless traffic and noise. And while backpackers hungry for the heady delights of Khao San Road may find it boring, it's an interesting stop for more sedate travellers, and you'll leave the House feeling educated and enriched."

The house is maintained very well by the management. Tour guide was very informative. Yes, it feels scripted but if you ask for more clarification, the guide will be able to answer satisfactorily. I wished we were allowed to re-explore the inside of the house after the tour was completed, as I feel the time given to explore by the guide was too short (only a few minutes was allocated for each part of the house)."

Tour very informative and all included for the admission price of 150baht - great value for money! Didn't go to the cafe attached due to time constraints but looked very nice and clean and reasonably priced. They have a shuttle that will drop u back to the main road every 15mins. We didn't use it but great service for people that need it especially in the heat! Can take your camera just can't use it inside his actual house but they tell u when that is and provide lockers with a key that you keep yourself so safe. Highly recommended."

We never saw any other houses like this, so I guess it is \"Thai style as imagined by a foreigner.\" We did enjoy the beautiful setting, the natural surroundings, the view onto the khlong, the harmonious use of natural materials.The house is used nowadays as a draw to get people interested in Thai silk, specifically Jim Thompdon brand Thai silk. This is gorgeous, sumptuous, beautiful. There's a dmonstration of how it was made, in case you don't have time to go up country to see for yourself. The inevitable shop is wonderfully air-conditioned. What a life to step in there on the hot afternoon we visited. Goods are beautiful. Prices are high.

I'd never heard of Jim Thompson before visiting this house, but apparently he was a silk/clothing magnate in Thailand before mysteriously vanishing in a Southeast Asian jungle in his 60s. The house itself was full of interesting tapestries and artifacts and is supposedly unique in its structural design elements. Admission gives you a guided tour through the gardens and the house which last about a half an hour. Overall, it was an interesting tour, got to learn a little about Jim Thompson, his life, and his fascination with the art of the region. The grounds themselves though were fairly small and though the tidbits we did learn were fascinating i think the allure of the place would have been magnified had i known of Jim Thompson's legacy before hand. As a museum, it's just ok, you're basically looking at the stuff a clothing magnate owned during the mid 20th century. Would have appreciated more history behind his empire and his rise to fame incorporated into the tour."

It was delightful, if a tad too brief.Again, as I have mentioned in numerous reviews on Bangkok lately, the signposting is terrible. But when you eventually find it, it's worth it. Welcomed warmly by the sort of staff I expected at other attractions around the city (and didn't find), we were asked to wait for the next tour group departing in a few minutes. This is the first gripe I have - there should, by now, be capacity for individuals to tour the House on their own.When we eventually set off, we were asked to remove our shoes. So you may want to wear slip-on footwear. The tour was 40 minutes and very scripted. The guide was lovely, but almost gave the impression she had learned the script parrot fashion. I'd have liked to have learned more about Jim, more about silk weaving and his impact on it, and more about the history of individual pieces of art in the house.The restaurant was also a more-than-acceptable food stop. In fact, one of the better dining experiences I've had on this first visit to Bangkok. Quiet, tranquil, with a good menu and amiable staff. Rare, in these parts."

Guided tours are a must - available in English, French and a selection of other languages - but you get to wander around after. Each tour lasts approximately 30-35 minutes. Our guide Anna was so gracious, and clearly passionate about what she does. Tours are organised in groups, so if you arrive early and have to wait for your assigned group tour to start, you can choose to have a look around the gift shop, the gallery upstairs, or hang out at the roadside stall just 50m or so outside, which serves a pretty decent bowl of kuey tiaw for 40 baht. No regrets about visiting here - 150 baht was a very decent price for a delve into the history of the place, the Thai silk industry, and the mysterious circumstances surrounding Mr Thompson's disappearance. Easily accessible on foot from the National Stadium BTS station."

It still retains the feeling of what it must have been like in the mid 20th century, the added administration and tourist facilities are far enough away from the house and garden and are quite tastefully done. We enjoyed a Thai meal in the restaurant - Tom Yum Goon and Tom Ka gai soups - both were delicious."

The formal living units are made of teak and the fine interiors are pretty much kept that show the rich taste of glorious times. The museum has a lush garden with a little pond that is also pleasant but for me overall the spot was a bit too touristic and commercial-oriented with too much focus on displaying the silk products. Not bad but maybe there are more interesting places to visit if in Bangkok - e.g. Wat Arun instead."

The admission price (150 bht for adults, 100 bht for youth below 22 years old) includes a free guided tour (about 30 min long) in the language of your choice. The four of us toured with a french-speaking guide and 10 other French people. Note that before visiting the house, You have to put your belongings in a locker, take your shoes off and are not allowed to take pictures inside of the main house. The house is beautiful with many chinese ceramics and various paintings and sculptures. It's is like a small museum.After the tour, you are free to wander around the gardens and secondary houses and take pictures. There are also \"mini shows\" with traditionally dressed dancers, \"artisans\" working with silk and a great (but expensive) shop with beautiful silk and textiles wares (clothes, accessories, scarves, table wares, ties...). If your budget is limited you can still buy there some great souvenirs like high quality linen tea towels or coasters. They're more expensive than at the Chakutchak market but also more classy as a gift. My husband bought some nice silk ties for 1600 bht each with whimsical elephant prints. For any total purchase above 2000 bht, they give you papers to claim VAT reimbursement at the airport."

The restaurant's decor is the usual Siam oriental chic design, food was nothing to shout about, though the price was reasonable.After lunch, we visited the Jim Thompson shop. I was expecting exquisite merchandise that are only available at the Jim Thompson House shop but was disappointed that the gifts and merchandise are the same that one can find in the usual Jim Thompson shop situated at any BKK major shopping malls. later booked a English-speaking guided tour of Jim Thompson House for $150 Baht per person.A word of caution, before you started on the tour, you have to deposited all your personal belongings, including all shopping bags, into a locker which is of unlimited size!All bulky bags that cannot fit into the locker must be placed on top of the shelve At Your Own Risk! The less-than -30 minutes tour was ok, but the tour guide could have shown more enthusiasm in explaining all the details of the house. I realized that she must have conducted this tour a zillion times but she sound like she is reading from a script and can't wait for to read off the last sentence! Overall, a visit only if you have tried all the other touristy spots in BKK and still got one day before you departed for home."

I think I ended up spending over 3 hours here, between looking around on my own, visiting the art museum, taking the tour, and having lunch.To get here, from my hotel in the Sukhumvit area, I took the BTS Skytrain from Asoke station to National Stadium station, changing at Siam. From the National Stadium station, look for the exit map that shows the Jim Thompson House (I think it was Exit 1, if memory serves). The street is a few steps from the BTS exit, and you follow it all the way to the end (by American standards, it feels more like an alley than a street) where you turn into a property that feels like you've been transported out of city chaos and straight into paradise. The buildings and grounds are gorgeous, and if you are into art, this collection is fantastic. The tour, offered in English, French, or Thai, cost about B 150 and lasts roughly 40 minutes. You get to go through the entire house, and the guides do a great job of telling the story of Jim Thompson, his role in the Thai silk trade, and the history of key art pieces. Be prepared to remove your shoes and place your personal belongings, including any purses or other bags, in a locker. You lock it up and take the key with you, and all my belongings were intact at the conclusion of the tour (I'm not one to part company with my purse, so I was apprehensive at first, but it was fine). The architecture and furnishings are amazing, and I love the story behind the spirit house and why those are important in the Thai culture (I'm not telling, you have to go hear the story for yourself!) The garden is spectacular - it really does feel like a small, private jungle. I saw plants and flowers I'd never seen before, and I loved the surprise of finding fish swimming in several of the urns. I had lunch at the restaurant on site, and it was delicious. They had lemongrass juice, which is now one of my favorite things in the world, and I sat at a table near a small pool filled with enormous koi. I confess I had a very American club sandwich for lunch (after a week of delicious Thai food, I was ready for a sandwich!), but I had a traditional Thai dessert that was delicious. There were a couple of Thai people demonstrating silk spinning and silk weaving, and there is an outlet of the Jim Thompson store, where you can purchase a scarf or another memento. Items in this store are a higher price point and appear to be of good quality. My final stop was in the art museum, where they currently have a rotating exhibit featuring various Southeast Asian artists. When I visited, the exhibit featured art in the form of a few short films.I strongly recommend the Jim Thompson House as a required stop in a visit to Bangkok."

Again we looked a little lost and a guy pointed us in the right direction, as we halted to check the map a local just sitting at the side of the road asked 'Jim Thompson House?' and pointed down a narrow side street. The house was a little way down the side street but found it without problem. The guided tour was both informative and entertaining. His life was described along with the love of Thailand, down to his eventual disappearance. Being ex intelligence for the USA there are many conspiracy theories as to what happened. His house has been preserved with lots of artifacts on show. Be prepared to walk bare footed around the house as per tradition and no bag of any sort allowed. One lady refused to leave her handbag and was told she could not tour so to leave only to appear a few minutes later and just pop her handbag into lockers provided which you get to keep the key of until you retrieve your bag."

We booked ourselves onto the tour once we arrived and whilst we waited for our tour group to be called we had a look around the plot. Very pretty surroundings and really interesting pieces of art of look at. The tour itself was also very good, the house was beautiful and has obviously been very well looked after and loved over the years. Our guide was great and even tried to crack a few jokes. Sadly we did not visit the restaurant which was a shame as we\u2019d just had an enormous lunch and we had heard great things about it. If you miss your opportunity to buy your silk etc from here, there is a Jim Thomson shop in Siam Paragon. All in all this was a welcome break from Bangkok chaos, although still very humid there. I\u2019d say the whole visit only took two hours max including our own walk around prior to the tour, but it is extremely close to the sky train and so easy to get to.

Apart from the historical facts, the current garden is magnificent and well maintained.The house itself is an architectural masterpiece and well worth the visit even though you may not take any photos of the inside of it.After the guided tour, you can spend money in the shop on the premises ($$$$$) Do not miss a visit to this house. It reflects so much about the true Thai architecture. The brief introduction to the silk industry was also very interesting."

About a 10 minute walk down a small Soi from a BTS station. We took the Jim Thompson House courtesy electric shuttle to save walking!Tours are conducted in many languages (must purchase tickets, but were inexpensive). Tour groups are small. The \"House\" is really a compound of several buildings. To appreciate the compound one should remember that when Jim Thompson built/assembled his \"house\" the location was in the suburbs of BKK, i.e. no large/high buildings around.House is adjacent to a Klong which stinks like a sewer plant intake structure overtime a water taxi goes by. Oh well, that's BKK for you (GRIN).Tour is worthwhile. Takes about 35 minutes. The house/buildings, except for one room isn't air conditioned. Dress in cool clothes and bring a hand fan if you have one.After the tour we ate lunch in the cafe on the grounds. Good food, cold beer, and the AC in the cafe worked well."

It offers a good tour of the compound; you can also see parts of the silk production; and of course enjoy a meal at the restaurant or buy a silky item in the shop. Do not miss an exhibit of modern art in an exhibition area; I really enjoyed the one on the show now. However, I must say that the lunch I had at the JT restaurant, although it tasted well (pad thai), probably caused my tummy problems. Unfortunately so, because I chose this place as a \"safe\" place to have a meal."

The house doesn't seem so unusually set out to us, but it would have been quite different for the Thai people who helped construct it. The house is full of antiques & Jim has recycled interesting pieces, such as chandeliers from palaces. It is a great/ lucky thing that the house has been maintained as he left it. It has lots of important art pieces & history that could easily have been lost with the modern world creeping up on it from all sides.The tour goes for 35 minutes & are held continuously, so you don't need to book ahead. You can take external photos, but none inside the house.It does not go into detail about his disappearance & it's not the time or place to pick him apart with tour guide, as one of the visitors tried on our tour.It's a place to take a break from the heat, noise & pace of Bangkok.

The house is \"nice\" and there are some interesting (albeit a limited collection) Thai art objects, gathered by Jim Thompson. But nothing more than that.The guided tour was, unfortunately, very poor. The guide was a young Thai lady, whose English was incomprehensible and who seemed not to know basic facts about the house beyond the manual she must have memorized. For example: what is the area of the house? It took my group some longer time and a joint effort of both the native and non-native English speakers to make her understand this and other questions. Still, she was not able to answer any of them."

There is a free shuttle (Golf buggy which takes you from the end of the street to the main road, but we never used it). Visitors are given a tour time, dependent on their language. Shoes are not allowed to be worn in the house and they have to be put into free, onsite storage lockers. The tour itself was fine and reasonably interesting, although a bit superficial. That said, it was pretty cheap for a 40 minute tour. There are other buildings in the small complex including a shop where silk items are sold. **Warning** - no photography is allowed in the shop, as I found out to my cost by a rather aggressive female staff member woman who approached me when she saw me taking a picture of my wife in the shop. A bit over the top, in my view.Other than that, visit was as expected and a reasonably pleasant experience.

We got there at 9:20AM and waited for 20 mins for our tour's turn. I think the more late you go, the longer you have to wait. My family was combined with 6 other tourist for our group tour to the house. Everything inside and outside the house was amazing! You will appreciate antiques and architecture of the house built by Jim Thompson. Everything there is thoroughly and artistically planned to every bit of its detail. The tour guide can speak clear English. There is also a relaxing cafe beside a huge koi pond if you want to lounge after the tour. Overall, its really a different experience going there.

It's a small place, with live exhibits showing silk worms and old-fashioned spinning wheels. A very nice shop sells silks of excellent quality. The highlight of the place, however, is the excellent, air-conditioned restaurant. It takes a while to get used to the heat of Bangkok, and the restaurant knew just what we needed -- icy fruit drinks and delicious appetizers to share!

We met a couple who had been there earlier and explained it was easy to get there by walking from the Princess hotel. The next day we got instructions from the concierge at the hotel made our way over there. It was really quite easy to find - through MBK - across the bridge to the sky train, don't go into the sky train - just go over to the other side of the road. Turn left (away from the Paragon) and walk past about 3 or 4 streets on your right - and you will see a sign pointing out the Jim Thompson house. You go in buy your entrance ticket go through the main gate and up to the desk on your left. The staff will tell you which tour group your in and what time you are going through. We waited about 20 minutes for our tour - but that time evaporated quickly whilst walking around the lush gardens and beautiful ponds all stocked with a variety of fish. On to the tour with a very good English speaking guide - who at times had a very good sense of humour. She explained everything there was about the owner and all about the house and the changes he introduced that the Thai people were astonished by. Jim Thompson was an American Architect who loved Thailand and the people and he is the reason why the silk trade has blossomed world wide. If you want to know more about him or what became of him - don't google it - just go there and find out for yourselves - you will not be disappointed.You can buy various items of clothing etc from the shop there but also try and go there and have lunch or dinner. The restaurant there is exceptional quality - and the prices are more than reasonable. Oh and at the end of your tour and if you take in the restaurant - there is a free shuttle service which will take you back to the main road, this will probably save you about 6-700m of walking - but after eating at the restaurant you might prefer to walk to walk off the food you devoured.This is just another one of Bangkok's hidden secrets worth seeking out. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a couple of hours to spare."

Nestled nicely in the neighbourhood of MBK Centre and Siam Square/Siam Paragon, it's a nice place to escape to before continuing on the shopping, eating journey in Bangkok."

The guides are very knowledgeable and speak excellent English - it is evident that they are proud of the place and happy to share the many charming stories of JT's life and creative endeavors. The tour only takes about 40 mins, and you spend the other 15 mostly waiting around and admiring the beautiful compound. There's a posh cafe attached whose menu prices commiserates with prices from the shop. Sadly, although JT's shop is large the range is not fantastic and I can typically find better (that is broader) selections back home in KL. This surprised me. A good and restful place to visit on the last leg of your trip, or after a particularly grueling walking tour. A very short walk from the Skytrain - no taxis necessary."

Go for an afternoon visit and stop in the lovely restaurant on site for an afternoon tea or lunch by the Koi Pond. The Thompson House is just a great way to glimpse nostalgically into imagining what Bangkok must have been like just after the \"Last Good War\" (WWII) right through to the disillusionment and betrayal of American values in the tragic Indochina War in the 1960s. A great way to pass a hot afternoon in the steamy heart of Bangkok!"

Jim Thompson is a legend in Thailand, during World War II and the Japanese occupation of Thailand he worked underground as an agent for the US Office of Special Services. After the war he settled permanently in Thailand. Jim Thompson had a passion for art but trained as an architect and besides his war time adventures he was a man of exquisite aesthetic taste. When he first settled in Bangkok in the late 1940s he discovered Thai silk and instantly saw a business opportunity. Unfortunately the art of silk making was dying in Thailand but Jim Thompson was intent on reviving this ancient craft. He established silk weaving schools and workshops in northern Thailand.Like many before and after him Jim Thompson was captivated by Thailand, its people, culture and art. He was a major collector of South East Asian art; amassing an extensive collection of artworks from around South East Asia. The pinnacle of his collecting passion was the brining together of six traditional teak houses from Ayutthaya and reassembling them into one large Thai-style house sitting on the banks of a klong (canal). He decorated the house with works from his collection; from ancient Buddha statues to exquisite and delicate pieces of pottery and traditional Thai paintings. He also furnished the house with examples of Thai furniture.The garden is a restful space giving a little haven to shade from the heat of the day. It is planted with tropical plants, and shady palms and has a carp pond, it is worth wandering around the garden to admire the plants and soak up the tranquility.Jim Thompson died in mysterious circumstances. While on holiday in Malaysia\u2019s Cameron Highlands, he wandered into the rain forest and was never seen again, he simply disappeared without trace. There are many versions of how he met his end. At the time Malaya was about to gain independence from the UK. There was a large communist insurgency that British forces eventually defeated, some believe that Jim Thompson was on a mission for the CIA and was captured by the communist fighters and killed.However he met his end in the fifty or so years since his body has never been found."

The photos of his house, often taken at night and photos on Google images and in the coffee table book, \"The House on the Khlong,\" looked so gorgeous (with dramatic indoor lighting showing objects of art to best advantage) that we could hardly wait to go and be charmed by the Jim Thompson House which closes at 5 pm. The complex of store, restaurant, and houses is such a small space, and there are so many people queued up to see them that everyone has to join a tour of 10-12 people. As one tour left a room, another tour entered it. Thus, at mid-day there was no dramatic lighting, the works of art were surrounded by tourists, and those who preferred to contemplate the atmosphere had to keep up with their group. Half of the complex was astir with groups stowing their things in lockers, taking off their shoes, or putting on their shoes. Although it is easy to reach the house by Skytrain, we think it is even easier to take Khlong Saen Saep boats from Pratunam to the Hua Chang landing. The house is worth seeing, well worth the small price of the \"tour,\" but not at all as charming as we expected."

This museum/tour tells the story of an enigmatic American OSS Officer (precursor to the CIA) and Bangkok resident who lived in the beautiful home on the banks of a canal (khlong), saving the Thai silk industry and then mysteriously disappearing in Malaysia in the 1960's. Jim loved Thai culture and art and collected many beautiful items which he displayed in this house, built from several smaller Thai teak homes, using the old timber to form a larger structure where he regularly entertained overlooking the factory on the other side of the khlong where Muslim workers hand-loomed beautiful silk creations.Jim was credited with single-handedly saving the Thai silk industry, which although an exageration, the industry flourished after his silk was chosen for the sets of the film \"The King and I\". The house was a beautiful home to Jim's lavish collection of objets d'art and was built from many up country teak houses around 1958. The tour of the house is very informative and the groups are small and tailored to your native language, so I joined an English tour. The Buddhist and Thai cultural artifacts are quite amazing and the house is so beautiful and surrounded by verdant gardens and guest/servant homes which are smaller than the main structure.The story is fascinating and the home and gardens beautiful.A must-see in Krung Thep Maha Makhorn.

Very peaceful and cool ambiance within the Jim Thompson House compound-- very welcome respite from the heat and the seemingly-unending temple tour. Tour was very brief and while it had the basic details and information about JT and his life in Thailand, I felt it lacked depth, especially when it came to the man and his character, his passion for thai silk, etc. The boutique is extremely overpriced, although some pieces were very nice looking. Eating at the restaurant was a much better experience than the tour itself."

Antiques, paintings, furniture fill the houses and represent, not only some of the finest aspects of Thai culture but also the intriguing personal life story of Jim Thompson.There is a shop (of course) and a restaurant but we didn't eat there.

[Boast coming:] I dined here when the place was still pretty much a private residence, with an old friend of Jim Thompson's in charge of the collected art. I speak from 40-something years of familiarity with the Jim Thompson House. And I never get tired of going back.The garden is a marvel. You seem to step out of the city and into a mysteriously groomed forest. The caf\u00e9 is dandy, one of the few remaining places in the city where you can enjoy a coffee in the open air. The staff are delightful, attentive and helpful. And the art collection and houses add up to a lot more than a collection of interesting stuff. Thompson had a remarkable touch for combining fine antiquities and revealing bits of daily life to bring a whole way of seeing the world into view. His creation here remains so vital it's easy to imagine he's still nearby, perhaps around a hidden corner of the garden. Other places (like Wang Suan Pakkad) have fine collections, but only here will you see a little girl's chamberpot helping set off a collection of fine china made to order for the nobility, or the fa\u00e7ade of a pawnshop set into the end of a corridor. If I had just two hours to show someone the spirit of Thailand as it used to be, and still is deep below the surface, I'd take her here without stopping to consider any alternative."

Plus a free tuk-tuk to leave you near the skytrain station."

Young girls (retaining and perpetuating the art?) spinning yarns as demonstrating the silk production process, and also providing a short but quite tasteful dance routine (photo op) and heavily populated and strategically placed staff that appeared to quite enjoy themselves and reverberated joy and pleasure in welcoming us to this \"long time no see\" revisit. It was reassuring to see that popularity and heavy traffic has NOT made the place a lesser experience, the people working there jaded nor impatient - it is well organized and a pleasurable experience benchmarking a Thai experience of high quality - designs, culture, views and vistas, structures and gardens replete with seats in the shade while waiting, lockers, refined bathrooms, taxi and tuc tuc drop off valet man, etc = go there first (early morning suggested) and early in your Bangkok visit. Quality of guides vary with the individuals but the sights and vistas make the compound simply \"a must\": Restaurant further delighted with an outstanding lunch experience of both comparative complexity, presentation and quality to much higher priced establishments encountered (mango passion fruit shake!) and a sans alcohol fare for two at $38 is quite \"price worthy\" - Boutique is the top of the line of their outlets and presents the latest of their production and gives you a taste of both traditional and contemporary wares. Had thoroughly delightful and exceedingly helpful courteous staff assisting and was warned accurately that \"some comparative products could be found at outlet store but there are no guarantees\" (which just so happened to be the case so one particular scarf was purchased at nearly 50% off at the outlet) You are hereby briefed - enjoy it and use, as stated: \"bench mark\""

What I enjoyed the most about visiting the Jim Thompson house even more than learning about the American who revived the Thai silk industry was learning about the Thai architecture. Jim Thompson combined several (7, I think) traditional Thai houses to create his little compound. I really enjoyed being able to go through the different rooms learning about the house and where he got the different materials for it. The small air conditioned boutiques were nice to walk through after being outside in the Thai summer heat for so long. I also appreciated the ride back to the main street. Overall, it's a nice place to visit."

The house is is very good order and I would say definitely worth the few hours one morning to see it.. Better to see in morning than afternoon due to the heat"

The shop selling greetings cards had some interesting things in it and I bought a few cards to be used for special occasions. The shop selling clothing and bags had some wonderful stuff but was really really, expensive - \u00a330 for a sun hat! There is a restaurant on site but we didn't try that. They run free battery powered taxis up to the National Stadium station which saves a walk of about 300 metres.If you feel like going, read up about Jim Thompson on Wikipedia first.Note that there is no smoking on the whole of the Jim Thompson house site."

Since I was under 25 at the time I paid half what my mom did. It was a bit pricey considering the cost for other places in Bangkok but I'd pay it again to go. Definitely recommend it. We went on the house tour and left to see Temple of the Golden Mount (we took a canal boat a short walk from the Jim Thompson House), returning for a big lunch before our overnight train to Koh Samui. The Chicken in Special House Sauce was to die for, as were the springrolls. We both wanted the black pepper steak for an entree but there were so many peppercorns that it was way too much spice!

However on a humid day one can take advantage of the free shuttle that departs the main road to the house. The tour is must. Only a small fee payable. Our tour guide was great. She also had a sense of humour. The house is purely beautiful & so glad this has been left to the Thai people. The silk products are simply gorgeous but a little out of my price range. There is also a beautiful little garden to roam around & feel the peacefulness of this must do attraction."

We had a spare day and after covering most of the main attractions we decided to do the MBK shopping centre followed by the Jim Thompson house which are very close to each other.Not knowing what to expect I can say I really enjoyed this museum. If you are under 25 take some ID as you will get it for 25% the admission price. You go on a tour on the preferred language you speak and are taken around this amazing house and learn about how it was built/constructed as well as the antiques that Mr Thompson collected in there. Fantastic tour and if you are near the MBK you should definitely give this an hour of your time."

Backstory: he was an American who decided to stay in Thailand in the 1940s-50s, and built a traditional style home adorned with antiques dating 200 years ago. While there, he was impressed with the silk, started his own Thai silk company, and sold goods to the USA. This put Thai silk on the international map, and became an important export for the area.Anyway, he mysteriously went missing in the Malaysian mountains, but his home is kept as a museum. I recommend going if you're interested in antiques, traditional architecture, and museums."

The guide spoke perfect English, and was very entertaining to listen to. There are many beautiful pieces of art and other stuff to look at.After the tour we visited the gift shop.

We visited Jim Thompson House in May 2015, the house was beautiful, it is maintained and kept in excellent condition. The complex also is pretty, very \"green\" and cozy, huge trees are everywhere. We took the guided tour for 100 Baht, the tour lasted around an hour (more or less), the guide took us to explore the complex and the house. We were not allowed to take pictures inside the house, all of our belongings must be kept inside the locker provided in the area, and shoes off (due to wooden floor I suppose). For those art and history lover will definitely like the tour. I am not either of those but still enjoyed the tour very much. This one is something different (not about Thai culture), highly recommended!Tips: wear something comfy as it can get quite hot inside the house, no air conditioning available inside the house. A hand held fan would be useful."

I took the suggestion of the leader of my upcoming tour, and found this place. I went on my first (and second) day in Bangkok. I was on my own. Get clear directions before going. I took the sky train and walked toward the canal, went under the bridge (turning left). After walking a ways along the boat canal, I found the small sign - and I was there. I appreciated all that this site offered. I stayed for dinner by the fish pond. Everyone was very kind, caring and friendly. I returned the following day and took the tour again. I enjoyed the repeated visit. Much easier getting there the second time, and my knowledge of the history of the place was broadened. Take advantage of the complimentary ride from the site to the main road after your visit."

At a very reasonable 100 Thai Baht exploring the grounds of the Jim Thompson House brought to life a time where sitting in the shade of a teak veranda, surrounded by green jungle/garden, sipping a cooking drink was the way to pass the hot afternoon in Bangkok. Jim Thompson was an architect, a spy, a diplomat of sorts, and a beloved business man who brought Thai silk to the world and then left the world as as an enigma, disappearing without a trace. He built the compound by dismantling houses from up country and bringing them to Bangkok to reassembly them into his main house and several smaller houses that store and display his vast art and antique collection. They combine elements of traditional Thai house with his own design. A tour is included in the admission price and after touring the gardens and structures enjoy a meal in the very nice waterside caff\u00e8 and shop for some Thai silk souvenirs. There are also some simple displays to demonstrate how silk is made. This is a great way to spend 1-2 hours! To get the most out your visit a quick read about Jim Thompson on Wikipedia is recommended."

The house and gardens are well preserved and interesting to see. The only way to get into the house is with a guided tour and they have really timed them well. Still you will bump into other groups on the way. For some reason photographing inside the house is not allowed. Nor are any bags or purses and you have to remove your shoes. However, it is rather nice to walk bear feted on the wooden floors. Well worth the 200 Bath per person."

Whereas the children were not a nuisance and were well behaved, it did slow down tour time. Early morning would be advisable as the house obviously isn't air conditioned so best to beat the heat. The gardens are lovely and in the cafe, try the mango tango. Yummy. The Tuk Tuk shuttle back to station nice gesture also. A nice tour and great way to spend the morning.

I visited it 30 years ago and again recently, the way it has been developed and maintained is quite outstanding. Highly recommended if you want to get a flavour of Thai traditions, beyond the places where everyone goes. An oasis on a small lane beside a klong, but easy to get to."

Most Buddhist temples & palace complexes are extremely crowded- but Jim Thompson house is totally peaceful & I will say must visit if you are in Bangkok for more than a day. They have timed tours for 40 mins duration & take batches of 10-15 max for 100 bhat per person. Starts with a Simple outside tour of garden, ancient collections of statues, silk designing equipment, etc. Later we move into the house & get detailed explanation for each part of the house, intricate cutlery, decor of each room & how craft fully jim Thompson designed it- it's maintained with the old glory!! Considering the artefacts are more than 200 yrs old, perfectly maintained to give a classic feel. It's not a boring museum, but an interesting journey into the father of Silk in Thailand. Do click pictures outside the house & you can try you hand in extracting sill from worm, just like they did in old days. Staff are extremely friendly & very helpful. The restaurant had good reviews, but not recommended for budget travellers -same holds good for their shop selling silk products. "

The home is impeccably designed and decorated and features some beautiful old art work as Thompson was quite the collector.

The house gives a great view into Thai culture, architecture and the Thai silk industry. It is interesting to look into the life of Jim Thompson himself. A tour guide takes you around the house in a small group and provide lots of interesting information. Photographs are not allowed to be taken inside the house, although outside in the gardens is fine.There is a small cafe for the visitors to have breakfast or lunch and a souvenir shop for visitors to buy Jim Thompson silk products. Finally, there are demonstrations of silk making and weaving. I recommend visiting this house and museum to anyone interested in the history of Thai silk. The house provide fascinating glimpse of Thai vernacular architecture."

The buildings now house a wonderful museum of South East Asian arts, again collected by him from Cambodia,Myanmar and Thailand. Sit in the garden amongst the orchids and chill out.

Jim Thompson house really consists of 6 small Traditional Thai houses that he linked together at his Bangkok site -- completed in 1959. The teak houses are filled with beautiful pieces of art and furniture reflecting Thai culture. There is an entrance fee of 100 Bhat that includes an articulate and very well-informed guide. Even if one could view the house without a guide (you can't!), one would ooh and ahh at the beautiful features of the house without fully appreciating it. The guide really brings the place to life. No photos are permitted within the walls of the house, but they are allowed outside the building(s), including the beautiful mini-jungle garden. Also, on-site are a decent restaurant, a live demonstration of some of the silk-making craft, and - of course - a shop selling a wide array of Thai silk products. A silk museum might not be for everyone's taste, but, if you are even considering visiting Jim Thompson House, then do go. It's meant for you. It's easy to find. Take the Skytrain (BTS) to the National Stadium stop. Jim Thompson House is on the opposite side of the street from the Stadium. When you exit the BTS, ask anyone where it is. Even those with very little English are used to pointing tourists in the right direction. It's less than a ten minute walk down the street, and a free shuttle service from the site will take you back to the Skytrain."

What I loved is that this museum is located at the end of a very quiet street next to a canal. It's really nice here, and a great break from the madness of the city. Also, the food at the restaurant is TERRIFIC. I had a lovely meal here. The drinks are great too! I would recommend coming here and spending some time eating and visiting the museum. The gift shop is really nice and has some beautiful things but is certainly more expensive."

While at first glance, someone might think it rather simple but if you take the time to tour the house and grounds, you can appreciate what this person did to revive the silk industry. It showcases some of the art and traditional home structure for the area. I will visit, tour the house and sit in the gardens. It is an oasis amidst a busy city."

A lovely oasis in the middle of bustling Bangkok - well worth a visit. Note: we arrived by boat and that's a fun way to get to or from there - only costs 10 baht too!"

As well as being a fantastic museum with a great and heartbreaking story it is a great place to go to chill out it is totally unbelievable how you can be in Siam Square or shopping centers or MBK Tokyu and within five minutes walk you can be in the most peaceful and tranquil place.

You are taken on a 35 minute tour around Jim's house and given a history of him and the house. My tour guide spoke fantastic English and was very helpful. My only issue with this attraction is that it seems to be a bit of a gimmick. It is essentially a rich man's house made famous because he oddly disappeared in the 1960s. Only attend if you are particularly bored and have exhausted other options."

Lady guides are friendly. Good food in the restaurant too. Silk items they have are quite expensive but of good quality. They got a souvenir shop as well."

Although the Jim Thompson house/compund is legendary, he too is legendary, and the grounds and the house are beautiful, please be warned that you're trapped inside. You pay for the MUST DO tour which is partially informative/somewhat instructive & it's quite well organized. The restaurant prices are a complete exploitation of tourists, although the food is good, we had 2 snacks and 3 smoothies, cost = 1560 Baht. Yikes! The gift shop prices equally represent the business values of the iconic place which are clearly to make money.If you're into the Jim Thompson thing then check it out but I can think of less exploitative ways to spend a few hours. They do offer free shuttles from the main road/National Center Sky train to the Thompson compound - which is only a 10 minute walk."

There is a free tuktuk shuttle from the National Stadium BTS, however we didnt make use of it as it was an easy walk.You pay for a guided tour ( heard German, French and of course English) and get given a time to be ready to commence. Time passed quickly as there were two beautiful Thai ladies doing traditional dancing in their beautiful thai silk clothing. They also spin silk and there was a man boiling the cocoons and making silk thread. There is also a little museum, a shop, restaurant and bathroom facilities.The tour is done barefoot and you are not allowed to take photos inside the houses. They provide lockers to put away your valuables whilst you do the tour. The guide we had was very professional and spoke good English. The area around the houses is simply beautiful and the information provided on the tour is very interesting and also gives you a better understanding of Thai culture and how it relates to their architecture. It was like being in an oasis of calm after all the hustle and bustle that is Bangkok. Highly recommend if you need to find your sanity again :-) "

I'm very happy that we did, because I got to learn a lot about Jim Thompson's contribution to Thai culture. Plus, that tidbit about how he disappeared and how no one knows what happened to him until now is attractive for a mystery buff like me.The house is in the middle of Bangkok, pretty near the Arts and Culture Center and many of the malls. When you get there, you'll find a restaurant on the right and the gift shop on the left before the main courtyard. If all you want to do is go to the restaurant or buy stuff at the shop, you don't need to pay for entrance. But I suggest you get the full experience by paying for the tour. It lasts for around 40 minutes and costs 100 Baht.They have tour guides for the major languages. And the tour takes you through Jim Thompson's \"house,\" which is actually a compound of several houses in the Thai style. Jim Thompson introduced his own modifications to the style, being an architect, and I learned much about why Thai homes were designed that way. Because Thompson was also a collector, the guide spoke a lot about the history behind some of Thompson's art collection.The house was lovingly preserved, airy, and stylish. It's wonderful if you're into art, culture, and bit of history. After the formal tour, they let visitors go around the compound freely. We went there an hour before closing, so we didn't have enough time to really relish everything. I'd suggest, therefore, that you get there early enough to both enjoy the tour and even hit up the gift shop.Regarding the gift shop, by the way, one thing we learned, though, is that you can actually get the Jim Thompson items for much cheaper at the airport Jim Thompson stall. So, if you want to get the items at the gift shop itself, for authenticity or whatever, go right ahead. But if you want to save up a little, I'd suggest you get them at the airport."

It's an easy hour excursion and about a 5 minute walk from the BTS train station. The compound is small even with the added restaurant and very pricey gift shop. You are not permitted to tour the inside of the house on your own and must go on a guided tour and check your purse so be sure to check tour times to avoid extra wait time. If you have a spare hour and this interests you, go, otherwise would recommend focusing on the true Bangkok life and culture. If you do go and have more spare time there is a really good massage place at the top of the street for 200 baht (about US$7).

I would love to have such a dining room at home. If only! The guided tours, only way to get around, are very informative. I loved the story about the \"mice house\". Which was an entertainment predating FB, TV et al. People would paint their mouse in a particular colour and let it run trough the mouse house, betting on which mouse would emerge first. Imagine painting a mouse. Flabbergasting! Yes! The small garden is a delight, providing shade as well as giving an idea what Bangkok must have looked like in days gone by. The restaurant is very good. We had lovely meal, admiring the various buildings which make up the Jim Thompson house. We also loved the little \"house of spirits\" as the entrance of the Museum. In order to please the spirits, a little house is constructed (looking like a little temple) and offerings are provided to keep them happy. Happy spirits make for a happy house! We went there by Sky Train and a little walk. There is a TukTuk pick up from the main road, every 10 min I believe. No bags are allowed inside, nor shoes. There are lockers, free of charges. WiFi available in the restaurant. What else can I say? Go and enjoy!!"

They also had purses, neck ties, and shirts. I was easily able to find the perfect scarf to bring back home. Outside of the shop, there were demonstrators spinning silk. We loved watching and talking with them on how the process is done. They even let us spin the silk. We did not talk the tour or eat there. We spent 30 minutes on the property. It is easy to get to on your own."

Jim Thompson was an American who re-invigorated the silk trade in Bangkok. The tour of the house was interesting but it is not much larger than a normal UK house so did not take long. I think it is a house on stilts, actually, two houses on stilts that have been joined to make one, the main rooms are upstairs but the facilities for tourists make the downstairs look sort of occupied. The house is built of wood, cleverly carved and set in the middle of grounds that include several other small (single room) houses used as guest bedrooms and studies. In the main rooms are display cases containing many significant objects (so significant that I cannot remember what - other than two childrens pottys.)There were fascinating displays of silk spinning and Thai dress and dancing while we were there which were perhaps the best part of the whole experienceThe house was approached past a Jim Thompson Shop where we could buy many examples of the silk products produced by the industry Jim Thompson had re-invigorated. My wife looked round the shop but even she could not convince herself the value justified the prices."

It is a fascinating story, The guided tour, included in the price of the ticket, was excellent and quite humorous. There is also a good restaurant which serves anything from small snacks to larger dishes, with wine or beer. The shop sells quality silk items, but is probably more expensive than other places in Bangkok. One word of warning if you are planning to go by taxi. We took a taxi there (80 baht on the meter from our hotel). When we tried to get a taxi back it was \"300 baht, no meter\". We declined. It's not so much the cost - it's the sheer cheek! My advice: take the free shuttle to the nearby Skytrain station, if it goes in your direction (37 baht each, in our case). It was quicker too."

He was an architect and designer and eventually moved to live in Bangkok (hence the house) He was ex OSS - CIA and was trained in jungle survival - however after his 61st birthday in 1967 he went for a stroll in the Cameron highlands in Malaysia and no trace of him was ever found again! Big mystery. He was liberal and had a lot of political contacts in the region so did the CIA get rid of him bearing in mingd the global politics of the region maybe he was abducted by aliens we will never know.He did build a traditional house however in Bangkok by a canal and using reclaimed materials from other houses it is built in the traditional style. Thompson also collected local art and antiquities and these are on site. The guided tour in a language to suit is fascinating. There is a shop selling \"Jim Thompson\" silks and a very good restaurant (unusually for an attraction).The attraction is a very different experience to the Grand palace and worth the 100Bht entrance fee.Highly recommended"

The 30 minute tours are frequent and in many languages with well spoken knowledgeable guides and you won't have long to wait. There's also a free tuk tuk to ferry you back to the BTS but my advice is to either arrive or depart by Klong Boat where the canals will connect you to the temples around the Grand Palace in one direction or to the mega cheap shopping at Platinum Mall in the other."

Jim Thompson House is located just 200 metres from National Stadium BTS station. There is an admission fee of 100 Baht for a guided tour (about 30 minutes). Guided group tours are available in different languages, you will have to wait your turn for a guided tour of the museum. It is quite interesting to note how Jim Thompson fell in love with Thailand, settled in Thailand and made Thai silk famous in the West. The museum which used to be the residence of Jim Thompson is made up of 6 traditional Thai houses assembled into one by Jim Thompson. It houses some unique Buddhist art collection and paintings.Photography is not allowed inside the museum, but you can click pictures in the premises. Before going into the museum, you have to remove your footwear and deposit your belongings in the locker. What I like about the place is that, in spite of being in the mid of the city, there is lot of greenery around the museum. I have been to Jim Thompson House in 2012 and again in 2015 and on both visits I found the museum to be well maintained. In fact, now they have introduced free shuttle services to the main road near National Stadium BTS stationI would suggest that it is a must visit place, you get to know about Thai silk and how Jim Thompson has become a brand and part of Thai culture."

We were unaware that we had to wait for a tour so we had to wait 30 minutes upon arrival for the next English tour. The tours also take an additional 40 minutes. We were not in a rush but it is worth knowing in case you are trying to see a lot of sights in one day. I would not say it is the most breathtaking museum I have ever explored but it was a nice change of pace from other sights in the city and it had a Swiss Family Robinson treehouse feel to it.

The downside is that in those few minutes I was biten by mosquitoes a dozen of times, which came as a bit of a shock as had had no issues in Bangkok until then (arrived a week ago). I suspect a combined effect of the early hour, the dense vegetation and the nearby canal.The House tour was interesting and gave a nice feel for the life at the time, a bit of history, a few bits of trivia.I found that aside from the bites, the experience was very enjoyable, and warmly recommend it."

The house is charming, and full of beautiful design details. However, there is so much to see in Bangkok, and this would never be in my top 10. If you are interested in art, and architecture this is a place for you.You are not free to wander around the house without a tour. The tour takes 30 minutes after which you are able to see the garden on your own. The house and garden are not that large, and tours are probably the only way to move large groups of people through the property.There is a lovely gift shop, though very, very, very expensive. Skip the Jim Thompson House and visit a wat, shop at a market, ride on the river would be my advice."

We simply went for the tour with a brief circle through the gift shop (lots of silk!) while waiting for it to start.

It was very easy to get to; a ride on the BTS to Siam, transfer to Silom line to National Monument. Get off at exit 2 and walk about 2 blocks-there you are. A tour costs 100 baht pp. You are entertained by 2 gorgeous tiny women in traditional clothing performing a dance that could be cheesy but is actually quite entertaining.

This place in fact introduced us to Thailand and its culture. We arrived with our backpacks straight from the airport and the free lockers saved our day. What we liked the most: The amazing place itself, the history (I love the 50's and 60's), the upkeep of the place (just spotless), the complementary tuk tuk to and from the BTS, silk extraction and the smiles all round. Verdict: It's a must visit if u r a history buff or even if you appreciate the old-age marvels of architecture."

Originally trained as an architect, he moved from the US to Bangkok after WWII and built up a compound from old wooden Thai houses which he had disassembled and moved. This is easier to do with traditional Thai houses which don't use any nails. So there is a fabulous architectural aspect. But Jim was also a noted art collector, so there's that aspect as well. Then there's the whole textile dimension. The organisation is world-class and the tour guides (in several languages) are well-informed and knowledgeable. Also visit the smaller buildings, the gallery, shop and cafe. Recommended."

Trees, green leaves and amazing wooden house and the canal make us feel so comfort and relax and want to stay longer. Beautifull dancers in thai traditional clothes will dance not so far from the entrance.We can only enter the house if we join the 45 - 60 minutes join tour they provide. We only paid 100 baht and we can choose 'English speaking guide' / 'Chinese speaking guide' or others. There is arround 15 - 16 people in one group. The local guides - mostly beautifull and friendly girls will lead us entering every rooms in the house ( two floors ), tell us the details of all rooms and tell us 'do and don't'. All of explanation they delivered make us feel that 'the spirit of Jim Thomson' is still here. This is the good way to know who is Jim Thomson, his ideas and his story of life. No body knows where is he right now, is he still alive or have passed away already. So, visit 'his house' maybe one way to remember him and - (maybe) one way to support the foundation."

An American who developed Thailand's silk trade after World War II, Thompson brought several teak houses to one place and connected them to form his residence, furnished with his collection of art from all over Southeast Asia. He located his home across the canal from the silk weavers. Formal tours take visitors through the buildings (no photos allowed), but the gardens are open and cameras are allowed. A shop on the premises sells quality home decor and clothing items. Thompson disappeared mysteriously in 1967 on a trip to Malaysia. The property is now owned by a charitable foundation. Plan to eat in the tranquil restaurant; food and service are excellent."

You learn about the history of Jim Thompson, the house, his work with silk and his mysterious disappearance. The house is just as he left it.

My wife had visited here on a previous trip and had told me the intriguing story of the western man who transformed Thailand's silk trade, then mysteriously vanished, so that was it, I had to go have a look.It's easy enough to find, off the sky train at National Stadium and down a side street nearby.When you get there and buy your entrance tickets, you will then be directed to another area to wait for the next available tour, dependent on the language that you speak (the tours are conducted in several different languages). We had about a thirty minute wait, so contented ourselves having a look around the gallery (some beautiful prints on offer) and the Jim Thompson shop - full of beautiful stuff, although mega expensive. The gardens are lovely as well, like a mini well tended jungle, right in the heart of the city, peaceful and tranquil.The tour itself was excellent. Bear in mind, in the Thai manner, you take your shoes off on entry and they are put in lockers to be retrieved after.The house is built in classical Thai style, combined with western ideas on how to use living spaces, and is absolutely gorgeous. Our guide stopped and gave a lengthy commentary in every area, talking about the design, the decor and the pictures and ornaments collected. It was fascinating.The house, the life story of the man who designed and built it, the setting - all were brilliant. Loved every minute, a great, interesting excursion.To top it all off, we decided to eat in the on site restaurant, and this was excellent as well. Lovely food, nicely presented, as tasty as you would expect and quite reasonably priced.All in all a very, very pleasant visit. Then we went off the MBK Centre nearby to shop until we dropped ......... Brilliant."

Unfortunately her soft-spoken voice was sometimes drowned out by an Italian lady helpfully providing simultaneous translation to her companion. Nevertheless, we could enjoy the visual impressions of this tasteful collection of artifacts in a unique house which combines six different teak buildings representing traditional Thai architecture.Thompson was also engaged in reviving and promoting Thai silk weaving. While he mysteriously disappeared in 1967, that part of his legacy is alive and well. The gift shop adjacent to the Museum is a joy to behold, even if one can't afford to buy anything..."

For bargains, you need to go to the Jim Thompson outlet which is not where Lonely Planet says it is. It's a long ride on the Skytrain. I forget the stop. Google it. But even when you get off, it's a fair walk. If an Englishwoman hadn't guided us, we would never have found it. The selection is modest, but I bought a lot of presents there -- ties, scarves, and t-shirts -- and Paul found a beautiful polo shirt. There's a nice cafe too with very good food and JT foods for sale."

This is a small gem hidden in Bangkok for those who get enough of temples, pagodas and the general hustle and bustle of this great city. Jim Thompson has a very interesting story and the house and his art collection is a must see for those who share his interests. Pro tip: Don't take the road back to the main road, but instead walk to the left when exiting Jim Thompson's house and go to the river. Here there is a small gangway that follows the river until a you reach a canalboat stop, go through this and you are now close to MBK center. It's a very nice \"off the beaten track\" route that takes you to the BTS."

The house and its contents are really lovely and the tour guide was excellent. However, although a wheelchair could probably navigate the gardens, because of the doorway thresholds in the old style Thai home, access to to the rooms just isn't possible. The city has grown up around this peaceful little compound and it's watery gardens, but it is easy to get a feel for what the area must have been like when Thompson was alive. The exhibit of Thai popular music contrast nicely with the demonstrations of traditional dancing and silk production held in the courtyard. There is a restaurant and shop if you want to have a meal and/or shop. If you love art and architecture, put this on your list."

The guides are very good at in the language and they have a full command in their languages, like English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean etc... You be give a tour No. it would be A , B, C or according to the size of the other groups and every tour lasts for 20 - 25 minutes. you would have to leave your bags in a locker or shoes at the downstairs and taking pictures of Jim Thompson's belonging ( or inside the rooms) is prohibited.However you can take pictures once your tour is done. on the whole it's a nice experience and I loved my time there. There is a restaurant ,a souvenir shop and a cultural center. and if you are lucky you would be enjoying a live traditional Thai dance.

There is an entrance fee of 100 baht (adult) and a 30-minute tour is included on your language of choice. I believe they have English, French, Chinese and Japanese.Prior to the tour, I've been searching online for photos to see what I should expect. Well, I didn't find much because cameras are prohibited in the house itself. THey also have lockers for your belongings and shoes prior starting the tour. I don't want to spoil the tour, so I'll just say that the compound is owned by Jim THompson, an American who fell in love with THai culture and who revived the silk industry. Being an architect, he built houses in Thai tradition and in total he had about 4-5 houses in the compound. Your guided-tour will be in his main house, and I'll let the guide give you information about the decors and the architecture.There is a lovely garden, a nice pond, a bar/restaurant (which is highly-recommended by reviews though we didn't have time to eat there) and a shop which sells their products (mostly silk).THere was a free shuttle service to transport you to the main road or to the train station. Tip: wear long pants, the area is mosquito-laden. it could also get a bit hot, so bring a fan"

Big, busy cities aren't really our thing so to find this beautiful place tucked away in the heart of the city was wonderfully refreshing and really lifted our spirits. It was fascinating to find out about how Thai silk is made as well as Jim Thompson's role in reviving it as a product. The garden, the house and its contents were all beautiful and the guided tour was both informative, humorous and just long enough (30mins) to be interesting without dragging on. I would recommend a visit particularly if you need to see a little green in a big concrete jungle."

We were in the last couple of days of our very good tour of Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangkok with Gate 1 Tours and had free time so, after previously researching the Jim Thompson House on Trip Advisor, we went.Firstly, you can't get to the house from Phayathai Road like some maps indicate. We crossed the Rama I Road on the pedestrian bridge from the MBK Center. Then turned left (west) on Rama I Rd and walked two blocks (don't count the driveway just off the corner) to Kasam San 2 Alley and turned in (right, north, and there was a sign) and the house is near the end of the alley on the left.You can only see the house as part of a guided tour and they have them in several languages. Backpacks and cameras are not allowed and they provide free locked locker storage. We walked the garden while waiting for ours to start. Not much, but pleasant.That pretty much says it for the house itself. However, art work throughout the house did deserve attention. The house was nice, but not as interesting as so many have indicated.On the way out there was a gentleman pulling threads from a silk worm cocoon over a pot of hot water. That was interesting! Jim Thompson's life was interesting and I'll find reading material to learn more. The tour barely touched on it."

While this was enjoyable and informative, it was disappointing that we were asked to wait 50 minutes for the next tour. We asked about an earlier tour, but advised there was no (English speaking) tours any sooner. Despite this, we noticed a tour was just starting, so tried to (cheekily) join it. After a few minutes, the guide asked us to leave the tour and wait for the correct one. I don't understand why - this tour had less people than our 'proper' tour, so it wasn't like they were full. The cynic in me wonders if they just wanted us to spend money at their restaurant while we waited. When the tour eventually started, it was pleasant. The guide was knowledgeable and informative.The restaurant (where we killed some time) was nice, but a little overpriced in my view. I guess they have a captive market, waiting for tours...The Jim Thompson store contained nice products, but I couldn't justify the prices. You may be interested in catching the BTS several stops to their factory outlet (153 Soi Sukhumvit 93, Bangchak, Prakanong, Bangkok 10260).

Entrance fee is B100 which include a guided tour and a pamphlet. Tour is available in several languages. We came early so there were not many people yet. I think this is a factor since they have tours simultaneously and you may find it hard to understand the guide if it's noisy or you hear several of them talking at the same time. It has a wonderful collection of art, and the architecture of the house is explained somewhat. As with most Thai houses, shoes should be left out before entering the house.There's supposedly a free shuttle service to and from this place, to and from the nearby BTS station, or Siam Paragon. We didn't take it so I'm not so sure. We were just told by our hotel receptionist about this and saw a shuttle upon leaving the place. It's just about 15mins walk from National Stadium BTS station. You could also ride a taxi boat if this is the more accessible form of transport where you're staying."

I took the skytrain from Sala Daeng to the National Stadium (28 baht). Then it was a short walk.The English tour was starting in twenty minutes, so I had time to explore the beautiful garden, watch an employee shred leaves to feed live silkworms in three gorgeous large bowls, photograph a cute little girl and a beautiful Thai woman on a platform weaving silk. Next to them was a display showing the unwinding of silk in the traditional way, with the cocoons boiling in a pot, and the silk being pulled into a wooden structure, coming out as a thread.The tour was short and interesting, and it was fun to step over the raised thresholds between the joined houses (according to Thai belief, they prevented evil spirits from creeping in at night to disturb the sleeping inhabitants) Our guide spoke in a musical way, and was quite humorous. She pointed out things I would definitely have missed, like the lamp shades made from drums turned upside down; chamber pots - one shaped like a cat for little boys, and a frog for little girls; the very short bed in the guest bedroom, for Thai guests; the window frames inverted, so that the decoration faced inside instead of the traditional way on the outside.She also explained about the spirit house, that Thai's believe that when you build a house, you disturb the spirit in the ground, so you build a little house for him, and feed him breakfast and decorate with flowers to appease him.A highlight was the 19th century Chinese mouse box in the main bedroom; a large wooden maze like box, with a glass front, she explained that it was used to house pet mice, and the Chinese painted different colours on two mice, and placed bets on which one would reach the bottom first.But what really blew me away was Jim Thompson's good taste; every item in the house was exquisite, wooden Burmese statues, Chinese porcelain, the wall hangings, and my favourite, a tiny statue on the study desk, depicting the creation of life. The window frames on the walls between the houses he joined together are used as alcoves to house beautiful old artefacts. Everything was very understated and tasteful, no glitter or kitsch.After the tour, which lasted about 30 minutes, I went to the restaurant overlooking the koi pond, and had a delightful meal, noodle shrimp salad which was delicious, and the best yoghurt mango drink of the entire Thailand trip (160 baht each). The service was a bit slow.Leaving the cool of the garden it was really hot outside, and I was pleased to discover the free shuttle service (it leaves every 15 minutes, to and from the skytrain)"

So I gladly visited the house. The garden is small but pleasant to be in, the houses are interesting, there is a restaurant and you can also see how the silk is actually made. There are some posters and articles about it. The guide was really nice, although her English was far from perfect. You will not miss a lot if you visit it, but you will most likely enjoy if you do. Fee is not really on the cheap end. The way the house was made and how it looks is maybe the most interesting thing in the whole story.

The house is amazing feat of architecture and it contains rare art and cultural pieces from the region. I wont tell the whole story here in the review since you will hear it there by excellent tour guides.Jim Thompson is located near the shopping attractions such as MBK. The nearby skytrain station is BTS National Stadium from the exit 1 you walk to next \"soi\" (side road) Soi Kasem Sam 2. The Jim Thompson house is at the end of the road, at the left side. It takes about 10 minutes from the BTS station.When you arrive there, there is fancy restaurant at the right side and silk shop at the left side. Behind the silk shop there is counter where you \"have to\" get the the tour which is mandatory but only 100THB per person. There are several different language options what the guides are able to speak. You will receive small paper about the history of the place and the man itself along with the number of the tour. After a while the number will be called and the tour starts. The tour takes about 20-30 minutes. Please do note that you have to take the shoes of when entering the main building and photographing inside is forbidden. The toilets are near the restaurant, be sure to visit them before heading further. Overall I highly recommend visiting this place.Remember to click \"helpful\" below and see my profile for more reviews in Bangkok and ASEA."

It also happens to be a beautiful oasis away from the omnipresent Starbucks, McDonald's and 7-11s.Don't listen to the naysayers. You have to question their reason for coming to Thailand in the first place when they visit a site that the local Thai people love, that the local Thai people benefit from, and the guy \"Jim Thompson\" is revered for what he did for the Thai silk industry and in saving Thai artifacts, but it's the tourist who doesn't get it.I would admit that it should not be in your top 5 for Bangkok. But after you finish the big Wats and start to wonder, what at least part of Bangkok used to look like, then paying a visit to the Bangkokian museum and Jim Thompson house is worth it."

The most interesting furniture I saw was the mice model house; essentially people put a mice in the model and see which hole it came out from (entertainment before the invention of TV). I would go there once to see how objects and concepts in different cultures blend together, but I am not tempted to go there again because the house was just a house - nothing really grand or spectacular. Good thing is whenever you go, you join a guided tour; that help understand the house a bit more."

If you go you absolutely must enjoy lunch in their restaurant and try one of their cocktails. Sign up for a quick tour of the house and after make sure you stop at the massage shop on the corner of the street for a full body thai massage for only 250 baht. We made sure to get the massages side by side in the back room and we were not disappointed. The tour, the great food, and then the Thai massages really helped us relax after the long flight from New York City."

Alternatively, you can choose to explore the area on your own without accessing the museum and this option is free of charge. Lastly, drop by the gift shop near the exit and you might chance upon something you like. If you spend above 2,000 Baht as a tourist, you can claim the VAT at the airport before leaving Bangkok, just remember to get the Claim Form from the counter when making your purchases."

I never got a proper reply. Maybe all the staff were stressed out by the frenzy caused by X'mas shoppers. I was there on 23/Dec/2014!JT's House, proper... is interesting but not worth the admission fee (no photos allowed). Likewise, the Thompson Cafe. Exorbitant pricing is the order of the day.The retail complex is on the ground floor of another house.

Can I get a VAT refund form so I know what I need to do? \"We don't have it here.

When I reached the VAT refund counter, miles away from the entrance, I was told I need to get Customs to endorse the form first!I raced back to the entrance.. only to be told I cannot exit to the public area where the Customs team is. How then? \"Ask Singapore Airlines to help\"I raced back to the Departure Gate, told the team there my problem. \"Do you have the receipt for the purchase\". Yes. Wonderful!Thai people are very patient. I can be, too. But I don't have Twelve Days of Christmas...not when I have a flight that is due to leave in 10 mins.

Its checked in ... in my luggage... its on the plane!!A few more precious minutes of ding-donging on the phone, they chorused.... \"We will off load your luggage, help you get VAT refund, you take the next SQ flight out - 3 hrs later\" (By the way, the next flight was due to leave half-full. My flight is full).Giving the embarkation Gate people benefit of the doubt, I thanked them - and declined to travel 3 hours later as I have commitments in Singapore, my destination, that could not be deferred. I had JT gifts to give as X'mas presents. How ironic!On reflection:It seems the Thai Govt is reluctant to give any refund. Why don't they locate the Vat refund counter near the entrance so that the Vat guy can stamp or endorse anything they wanted cause they have airport passes to go anywhere that we can't?Why don't the VAT guys, on my first encounter, mention to show them the items purchased in addition to just the receipt?WHY WAS'NT JIM THOMPSON's staff more savvy about this to help customers with proper and complete advice to get VAT refunds? Thanks to this nightmare, I will never buy big ticket items or spend on purchases when in Thailand. Hotels, tours, food - items I can't get VAT refunds are still \"ON\". Otherwise, I'll end up getting VATed again. No wonder Thais are always smiling.All said, I attribute my plight to the source .... Jim Thompson House's staff.They provide a free vehicular shuttle service to and from Jim Thompson House. They have a sign that says so. But no one is in attendance and no time schedule is shown. Queuing is not suggested, nor organised or recognized. But there are lots of staff at the entrance just standing around.When our chartered van came, strangers in the queue clambered on board in a mad rush. Its an embarrassment that could have been avoided. Beyond embarrassment, it is a shame that JT's staff seem to be as lost as Jim Thompson himself - may he RIP.And thanks to JT, it was Barely Xmas for me this year!But Singapore Airlines offering to offload my luggage and putting me on the next flight? Kudos!Here Comes Santa Claus!!! That is the kind of service even other airlines are talking about."

I don't care for joining tour groups, preferring to ramble about on my own, snapping pictures at my leisure. However, you cannot explore this house unless you are part of the tour, so I reluctantly joined.It turned out to be an enjoyable trip with a wonderful historical perspective about Thailand, rather than a tour about a house. The tour guide was sweet and engaging and clearly very proud of her Thai heritage. I learned a great deal about Thailand, their spirituality, and their national pride. In addition to the historical perspective, she pointed out many unusual decorative items throughout the house which added a bit of fun and corniness to the tour. Very cute. Be sure and look for the 'mouse house' while you are there."

When the house was built, it was considered to be located in the suburb next to a functional canal or klong. Then, Bangkok was the Venice of the East and canals were the thoroughfare. Now the house is in the middle of the city and it is difficult to imagine why it was built as it is. There are many collections within the Jim Thompson House that reflected the past century and well worth to spend few hours in appreciating it."

There is a compulsory guided tour on the main level of the house which require all to remove their footwear. After which, you may wander around the gardens and head to the store for some (window) shopping.Overall the house is pretty well restored and I found it interesting to learn of an American who was so into Asian culture.

The guide we had was a sweet Thai girl, and she had good information on the history of the House and Jim Thompson. However I wished the pronunciation was clearer. Many times I had to guess what she was saying. I tried to listen to other guides' pronunciation and see if they were better, they also had heavy accent or strange pronunciation. Maybe the Foundation could hire a proper English teacher to help them?The garden was lovely, but we got bitten by mosquitos.

The restaurant itself has an excellent name in Bangkok, and there are also some charming demonstrations of silk weaving and dance outside. The short walking tours through the house itself are organised exceptionally well, with groups divided into language and friendly and informative guides - I have been twice to this attraction and both times my guides spoke excellent English. The story of Jim Thompson is fascinating, and on top of this his atmospheric home holds some beautiful old treasures. Entry to the house is very reasonable at only 100baht, and afterwards there is the opportunity to browse in the large retail shop selling this famous brand of silk clothing and accessories, as well as a smaller area with books and postcards. I always recommend this attraction to visitors to Bangkok who have any interest whatsoever in history, silk or would simply love to see a traditional Thai home and/or quiet garden with beautiful plants and flowers."

The answer is most likely to be \"The Thai Silk Industry\" and flagship is the Jim Thompson Brand. For this reason the Jim Thompson House is well worth a visit for the rich history that it holds. It is not only the residence of the reviver of the Thai Silk Industry but a good example of Lanna Architecture. There are many facets to the Jim Thompson House, the Restaurant, the Shop and the House. The Restaurant will give you a taste of traditional Thai Cuisine, the Shop offers the latest in Thai silk offerings. (Everything from ties & scarves to handbags & wallets) and of course the House is a rich finding of what a home in Bangkok looked like back in the '50's of the previous century. Easy access via the BTS Sky Train to the National Stadium and a short walk to the Jim Thompson House. The Jim Thompson Farm is also well worth visiting, but we can cover this in another article"

To be honest we thought that we would see more about the gentleman's connection with the silk business, but we ended up spending a pleasant hour wandering round the house, historical it may be, and interesting, but it felt a bit of an intrusion into someones personal home.

The guided tour is offered in multiple languages and takes about forty minutes. Pictures are allowed only in the garden and from outside the house. Exterior pictures of the home fail miserably to capture the architecture and inside design of the house. The gardens are very small, but pleasant. My favorite part of the visit was to have a pint of beer in the restaurant, contiguous with the house. I was not hungry to eat, but the restaurant does offer dining in a nice atmosphere. I sat at a table next to the pool of beautifully colored fish, enjoying my beer while escaping the humid heat of Bangkok. The gift shop also allows no pictures, which is puzzling. It is a nice gift store offering some unique designed material. Jim Thompson is an interesting man leaving his legacy as a great entrepreneur who jumped started the Thai silk trade creating an industry in Thailand for exporting quality silk goods world-wide. I always find it interesting why authorities fail to pursue a DNA of the remains found in a shallow grave several decades later believed to be of Jim Thompson, identifying the remains to determine definitively if they are his remains and then proceeding to do the forensics to learn how he died. The mystery continues."

The Jim Thompson House is a popular tourist attraction deep in the heart of Bangkok.The narrative promoted by the museum representatives is one of a dynamic, worldly, and dashing American businessman, World War II spy, and architect Thaiophile who saved the Thai silk industry from extinction. At the height of his industrial career, Thompson 'acquired' six antique homes from Ayuthaya and Bangkrua, unearthed and dismantled them, and sailed them down the river to their present location on a Bangkok canal.The six houses and living room that make up the museum are touted for their period and design authenticity. Yet a counter-narrative emerges that Thompson distorted (perhaps perverted) every design feature, tradition, and custom that supposedly define Thai architecture and design of any period. For examples, he added Western flooring, combined rooms with common 'walls', added Western-style windows, and inappropriately placed Buddhist religious art throughout the Thompson House. I'm no expert but the crooked and warped (re)construction seems deliberately exaggerated for effect. He introduced 'acquired' art work from all over South East Asia to make the interior of the house look distinctly un-Thai.As the tour progressed, I became more and more skeptical about the tour guide's narrative about the unique and authentic cultural significance of the Jim Thompson House.I suspect the historical truth is something a little more base and pecuniary, and perhaps lost to the sands of time in the Land of Smiles and No Straight Answers."

Although Bangkok is busy, busy, busy, The Jim Thompson House is so calm, quiet and peaceful. At only 100 Baht entry fee it's a real bargain too. They have a very nice restaurant and a shop, obviously. We had a lovely tour from a very cute Thai girl, she knew everything about the houses, collection etc and delivered it in an informative and humorous way. They also had a demonstration of gathering silk in the traditional way.This museum was a real highlight of Bangkok and I'd say not to be missed."

It is an oasis of peace and tranquility right in the heart of the city. It is compulsory to take a guided tour around the complex - the guides are charming and knowledgeable young ladies. The teak and ironwood construction of the buildings is fascinating - as are the internal furniture and objet d'arts collected by the unfortunate Mr. Thompson before he mysteriously disappeared. The complex is immaculately maintained and contains a bar/restaurant and toilet facilities - both spotlessly clean. There is a very interesting demonstration of the production of thai silk. A visit is highly recommended."

It is certainly worth the time to visit and do the guided tour. It offers a small insight into some of the mysterious architect. His training shows through in the house complex layout and the ambience and features of the various parts of his final house layout. It is not expensive and, I think, better value than some of the temples.There is a restaurant included in the complex and it offers good food at prices slightly above other choices. Service is good cafe standard and friendly. However, I had a small negative experience when no change was brought back to the table after paying in cash. I queried this event as the change amount was well above any reasonable tip and a service charge had already been added. The explanation was a claimed misunderstanding that I had said the change was not required. In these circumstances I took all my change deciding that the service charge was sufficient tip.You can get here easily by BTS Skytrain (National Stadium station) and there are golf cart shuttle buses available at the beginning of Kasem San Soi 2 or you can walk the short distance."

His covert role during WWII, his influence on renovations of the Oriental Hotel after the war, and his unexplained disappearance in the Cameron Highlands, all ooze mystique. And he created this beautiful home for himself; a place that is every expat's dream. Take a look, and lose yourself in the charm of old Siam, and wonder at the mysteries that surround the architect of this Bangkok icon."

We took the above ground train and it was a short walk. The house is beautiful. If you are into history and Thai architecture, it is certainly worth a tour. Our tour guide spoke good English and she was friendly and informative. The garden below was pretty and one has to let one's imagination loose to picture the high society parties they had there. Wonderful. Worth a visit for sure."

I went mainly to have lunch there, as it was close to our hotel (lunch was pretty nice). Then decided to pay to be guided around the house, it was only 200baht for two.Basically, let me save you some time. - It's an old wooden house, owned by a rich, American (presumably dead*) and it has some nice ornaments in it. But not really enough personal artefacts to make you feel connected to the owner. I like watching house programmes, grand designs etc, so I am not devoid of being interested in architecture, and frankly, I thought this house was dull. I think if it was left how he left it, a living, breathing, working 'house', then I would have had some emotional attachment. And it would have felt more like a representation of Mr Thompson and not just a sterile, museum-esque building. On the bright side - the tour guide was nice and her English was good.Overall though, Jim Thompson House is nothing more than a shell of what I imagine it used to be in Jims time.I feel like I could have used the time to do some more interesting things in Bangkok. *The most interesting thing about the Jim Thompson story, is that he walked into the Malaysian forest one day, and was never seen again....."

There was little said about the building and architecture of it and I really wanted to hear more. I also wanted to hear more about the silk production as well and unfortunately the gentleman near the entrance who was working the wheel could not answer my questions.The store on the property has really beautiful high quality products that came with the price.Worth visiting."

All officers were helpful and offering to help us taking our pictures. Such a romantic and melancholic place to sit and read your book under the giant tree.Feels like we were back to the past, just after the second World War.

The mandatory guided tours are very informative and as always the guides delightful. It's well worth taking the public taxi boat back from the canal right next to the house. It's great fun, and watch out for the roof which lowers as you speed towards low bridges."

This time I crossed the klong at the back to find a small thriving village of weavers in the heart of Bangkok."

Moving to Bangkok after WWII, he single handedly revived the dying art of Thai silk, and built a successful silk business around it. An American architect by trade, he journeyed around Thailand, selecting six traditional Lana style houses, had them dismantled and shipped to Bangkok, where he used his architectural talents to redesign them into one very beautiful home. The house is filled with Thai artifacts of historical and artistic significance. The gardens are incredibly beautiful. The restaurant on the grounds also serves excellent meals. This is well worth the time spent."

Service is probably the best in Bangkok.Merchandise store is premium - you get better stuff for your buck elsewhere. Let the mind talk, not the heart.A classic stop in Bangkok."

His collection of ceramics and other art forms (scultures, carvings) will definitely ooh and aah those who appreciate such things. The tour guide we were assigned had a good command of English and was delightful in rendering an explanation of each room and the articles in it.

The guided, shoeless tour around the various rooms and buildings of the compound he put together after the second world war really gives an insight into life in post war Bangkok, abliet for an affluent expat.The various buildings have been very well preserved and give an indication of Thompsons eye for style and design. Add to this the mystery of his disapperance, it is well worth the stiffling temperatures in some of the buildings, very thankful for the huge rotating fans in most rooms. Beautiful collection of traditional Thai buildings in a very attractive setting. The shuttle buggie back to the main road is also a nice touch. Highly recommended."

Jim Thompson House is approximately a 30 minute shuttle bus ride from our ship terminal and is located in the downtown area surrounded by modern buildings and the canal at the rear.Upon arrival to the House via air conditioned mini-bus, the entrance had a display on Thai silk making and native Thai dancing.I won\u2019t go into the history of Jim Thompson, other than he is credited with the revival of the Thai silk industry. It is sufficient to say that Thompson House is a collection of buildings including Mr. Thompson\u2019s living quarters and collections of Asian artifacts.For the first 30 minutes or so, we were able wander around the tranquil landscaped grounds and some of the open structures. After that, we met our pre-arranged Thompson House tour guide. This young Thai lady had a good command of the English language and we had no problems understanding her.The guide basically led us through the various structures and gave us tidbits of information on the history of the structures and the art collection and treasures.The Thompson House tour lasted approximately 1.5 hours.I\u2019m not into this kind of attraction/history. It was interesting. However, if your travel itinerary has time constraints, I personally would not consider this a priority attraction. You would be better off spending time going to visit the temples and other attractions.I would rate this attraction as average - 2.5 out of 5 rating.Notes and Tips\u2022 Inside the entrance there is a retail shop selling silk clothing, accessories and souvenirs. The prices, in my opinion, are comparable to Western prices.\u2022 Photography is prohibited inside the house.\u2022 Going through one of the buildings, we had to remove our shoes.\u2022 Thompson House is less than 800 meters (1/2 mile) from the MBK Center (shopping mall)\u2022 This was day 1 of 3 of our Bangkok tour through Wandee Tours. Our tour guide Wandee spoke fairly good English; good enough for us to understand.\u2022 After the Thompson house tour we visited the Golden Buddha, toured Chinatown and the flower market.\u2022 Days 2 and 3 included tours of the Grand Palace and temples, train market, canal boat tour and floating market.\u2022 Our ship the Azamara Journey has room for 700 passengers and because it is a smaller ship, it can dock \u201cdowntown\u201d. The larger ships dock farther away resulting in longer transportation times to the downtown core.\u2022 The first thing I noticed while I was on the tour bus was the amount of traffic on the roads. Regardless of the time of day it appeared that \u201crush hour\u201d was all day and evening. Furthermore, the shoulder of the road becomes an \u201cextra\u201d lane."

Entrance is 100 BHT (adults) - and with that you get access to and guided visit of the house - in you preferred language (I heard French, English, Chinese...). In addition to access to gardens (not huge... but wonderfully tropical).By the canal, the house no longer has direct access but still is at the foot. all-dark wood house surrounded by tropical gardens and filled with centuries old Asian art and antiques, gathered by a very interesting figure to get to know. A bit frustrating: no picture taking inside the house... I recommend, if like me you like a break from temples and shopping ;-) On the premises also : bar/restaurant, JT boutique (silk et more) and a museum (not sure about latter - did not spot). 5 mns walk from National Station subway station. if that is your chosen transportation."

We were staying at the Pathumwan Princess and just crossed using the skywalk and walked 200m along the main street's sidewalk - checking out little shops along the way down to Soi 2 and caught their courtesy shuttle down that street to Jim Thompon House. Very easy. What a beautiful setting in the midst of the big stinky city. Lovely gardens and I felt we finally got that bit of Thai culture that I wanted to show the kids (yes my fault for taking them to Phuket!!!) a traditional Thai dancer, and the silk production display to start with. You do the 45min compulsory tour with a guide and look at the gorgeous artefacts collected by Jim Thompson. It may have cost 250 baht for 2 adults and a teenager, young boy was free. Yes you do lock up your belongings before entering, but we at no time doubting the professionalism of this whole arrangement - 5 star service and staff. Very interesting - kids loved the turtle and croc fish in the pond. We had coffee and cake after, then spent some money in the shop (which I do believe is a little pricier than other shops, but hey if you are there just do it, I only compared to the airport version which was slightly less like say 50baht on a 1000baht item) Very very worth while if staying close by!!!!!"

Within walking distance from Siam Square, this little sanctuary of history was not expected. After paying my entry fee (50THB for those under 25 - 100THB if over) I was warmly welcomed into the garden of Jim's house. The tour began promptly, the guide spoke English very well and was very knowledgeable about the items in the house, the architecture and Jim Thompson himself. I had no knowledge of the subject so was entertained and informed by the end. My only annoyance was others in the group tour who expressed their displeasure with the following: having to check your bags, having to take your shoes off and not being able to take photos within the house. These are pretty acceptable expectations (in my eyes) for a place of this nature, it protects the wood of the flooring, the delicate silk and the artefacts from being knocked over! Overall I was pleasantly surprised with my visit, it was very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone staying in I around Siam Square who is a little sick of shopping!"

It was a decent walk from our hotel (Renaissance Bangkok) - maybe 20 minutes or so. My guess is that it would take a little less time, but we were walking in the middle of protest pop-up markets so it took us a little longer. Anyway, we got to the street leading to the house and were greeted with a golf cart that was shuttling guests to the house itself. We opted to walk the rest of the way, but I am sure it is very helpful for older guests to the house. The grounds are very well kept and very conducive to large crowds. We arrived without a tour reservation and only waited 20-30 minutes before our tour started. The grounds are equipped with a restaurant and a very nice and air conditioned gift shop. The gift shop is a little pricey, but we got a few goodies there for a reasonable price. The tour was very interesting and informative. The grounds are small so there isn't an incredible amount to see, but the architecture, furniture and artifacts in the house are beautiful. Our tour guide was very friendly and spoke very good English. Once our tour was over we were able to still walk through the grounds, which we liked a lot. We got to spend more time in the outdoor areas of the home, too. I think this tour is a must-see in Bangkok, but isn't as dramatically breathtaking as some of the temple tours, etc. Jim Thompson was an American so his house is an interesting Bangkok attraction. It was still interesting and added to my knowledge of Bangkok/Thailand history. One last tip: No photos on the tour, FYI."

The little side walk street vendor on one side and a modern cafe on the other ... going further were filled with beautiful greens and flowers along both sides of the road. Finally, the sign that read 'Jim Thompson House'. We were welcomed by an amazing of sight of traditional Thai red houses surrounded by a gorgoeus garden. Every bit of the place was lovely to the eyes and mind. There was such tranquility walking through the garden - fortunately, it was not a busy day. Whilst waiting for the tour to start, we took a walk to the beautiful garden and also browse through some of the exhibits on the ground level. Even the stroll was relaxing. The colors of the gardens with the light breeze gave a certain warmth.The guided tour was simple but informative. It has enough information to help better understand what a gifted and talented visionary Jim Thompson was. Even though he came across as a very intelligent man, his uncompromising acceptance of the Thai culture seemed to exult the power of the beauty of Thailand. From his collection of antiques, his clever ways of designing his residence compound by 'stitiching' different homes together by the river side to how he influenced the silk trade in Thailand, was nothing short of an amazing story to know of.After the tour, we went to the Jim Thompson restaurant. We ordered Massaman Curry and Basil Pork with rice. It was delicious. I would highly recommend to relax at the restaurant and have a delightful meal there to end off the tour before hitting the store. I would love to visit the restaurant and take a stroll through the garden just to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city for a moment."

I knew very little about the silk trade or silk worm and learned a lot here. Jim Thompson's home and antique collection were beautiful, the gift shop had a wonderful selection of quality gifts. The admission price also included an English speaking guide who was very knowledgeable on Thai traditions and superstitions. I also had lunch at the garden restaurant, the food and service was very good and reasonably priced. You will want to learn more about this amazing man after visiting his home."

Free golf cart type shuttle to the Main Street and from about every fifteen minutes if you want to wait. Shopping for authentic Jim Thompson label creations available on premises as well.

It was a short walk to the House from the BTS but there is a shuttle option I discovered. Not sure where it picks people up though. I saw people arriving and leaving on the shuttle but I preferred the walk. Once you arrive, you buy a ticket on your right hand side. Then you check in and they tell you what time your tour starts. The tour is very interesting and not too long. You get to see all the rooms but no pictures are allowed unless you are on the ground floor by the gardens. Each room shows you a variety of interesting art pieces. I enjoyed admiring the furniture as well. It is not expensive either for the tour. It is totally worth a visit. They have a restaurant as well and a store where you can buy some Thai silk. It is an extremely relaxing thing to do in Bangkok."

The house is nice and is worth seeing if you are into architecture. The grounds are beautiful and the various antiques in the house are beautiful. The staff are knowledgeable and our guide spoke very good English. There are regular demonstrations of traditional Thai dancing and some demonstrations of silk yarn spinning. The restaurant has decently priced meals and the service staff are very attentive and professional. I did not visit the gift shop as I visited the Jim Thompson store in Siam Paragon already. This site is worth seeing if you have additional time to spare in the National Stadium BTS station/MBK area and takes about one hour to explore. One thing to beware of: there are taxi drivers that will wait outside the gates of Jim Thompson House looking for fares. Only agree if they will use the meter otherwise the fare, while still cheap by Western standards, is overly inflated."

I wasn't sure what to expect, but it is such a beautiful urban oasis, and a place to experience a bit of history, traditional Thai architecture and art, via the collections of a Western orientalist and businessman. When you arrive you are assigned to a group; tours (in English, French and I think other languages) are conducted in small groups and last about half an hour, during which you'll see the house and antiquities Thompson collected. You are then free to spend a little longer in the lovely grounds, and there is also a gallery which when I visited had a fantastic modern East Asian art exhibit.NB there is a free shuttle tuktuk service from the main road. Also note that there are fans but no air conditioning in the house so it's better to visit at a cooler time of day."

            "review": "The legacy of Jim Thompson, highly recommended to visit. We heard the first time about Jim Thompson during our second visit to Thailand.We were intrigued from the beginning about his mysterious vanishing and have read a few books about it.Finally we found the time to visit the Jim Thompson House Museum.We took a taxi from our hotel, the Four Seasons (Please see also review.) to the museum. Entrance was 100 THB per person or ca. 2.35 Euro (ca. 3.15 USD). The house and garden were an oasis of peace and quiet in the heart of Bangkok.Near the entrance were the cashier, the restaurant and the shop.There were also ponds with two turtles and kois. The gardens were surprisingly large and can be explored alone, but there is a compulsory guided tour, if you want to see the inside of the house.Meeting point for the tours was the central square. There are different languages on offer including English and French.Before our tour started we went through the garden. It was peaceful and romantic, until one of the groups disturbed us and we were in the way.Jim Thompson was more Thai than the Thai themselves, so he was fascinated with everything the country had to offer. Besides single handed saving the Thai silk industry, he also amassed a large collection of Thai Buddhist art, but after a run in with the government, he gave it up and started instead to collect Buddha statues from Cambodia and Burma - according to the author William Warren. There are some of the oldest and rarest in the collection.The house is made up of six traditional Thai buildings - they are from the 19th century -, which interconnect. There are some differences though, for example the external walls and decorations are inside as is the stair case. In a classic Thai house it would be the opposite.Upstairs are the infamous dining room, the living room and two bed rooms. One was Jim Thompson's. Even the mattress, where he slept on, is still there. Touching is not allowed, though. There was security as well, so there is no chance to wander off and search the house for clues what really happened.We enjoyed our visit and indulged in some retail therapy after the tour.Would we recommend this attraction to a friend? YES!Would we visit this attraction again in the future? YES!"

If you haven't been able to go into a traditional Thai house, then the tour here is worth it - it is a beautiful house and gardens. If you have seen it before, then you can probably give it a skip.Finally, the store is small and limited selection - and the prices for Jim Thompson are not what I would call a bargain (although the quality is very high). If you really want the JT silk - head to the larger main store."

Jim Thompson's house is located a short walk from the Sky Train's \"Stadium\" station which is just a few hundred feet from Bangkok's major shopping district. This \"house\" is must attraction for both the man who built it, Jim Thompson, as for the house itself.First the man: Jim Thompson was an American CIA agent in southeast Asia who settled in Bangkok shortly after WW II. He became fascinated with Thai silk which was hand produced by individuals and was slowly dying out. He started a company to produce and sell the silk. He was so successful that the silk was even used for the costumes of the movie \"The King and I\" in the 1950's. He is credited with saving the Thai silk industry. In 1967 Jim Thompson mysteriously disappeared while vacationing in Malaysia. The mystery has never been solved.Jim Thompson loved the old style teak houses of Thailand which were being torn down to build modern houses. He managed to purchase several of these houses and had them reassembled to make his home on a canal and house his extensive antique and art collection. He also bought some crystal chandeliers from a palace that was being demolished. What you have is a traditional Thai house built to make a home for a 20th century western man. It's a wonderfully eclectic collection of Thai antiques and modern furnishings in this house.There is also a museum on the property which has exhibitions relating to the silk industry in Thailand."

There is a restaurant that looks very nice where you can get a drink or something to eat. If you walk left out of the entrance to the canal, turn right and go down about 100 yds to a dock, you can take one of the river boats at Hua Chang (going west-left) to the end of the San Sap canal and end up near Democracy Monument, which is then walking distance to Kao San Rd and many other tourist destinations. The boat ride is a bit adventurous (all locals) but fun and a good way to see dwellings on the canal. It costs about 30 baht on board, maybe less. I highly recommend the Jim Thompson House!

Easy to find and breathtaking as soon as you enter the grounds. A lovely piece of history in the centre of a busy city. You pay 100THB for a compulsory guided tour in English or French and they last around 30mins. Beautiful antiques are dotted throughout the house and grounds, and you can buy some of the infamous silk products in site for a medium to expensive price, but the quality reflects what you pay for. Overall a wonderful breather from the hectic Bangkok world and the crowds of the Grand Palace etc!"

Do not confuse his life with another Jim Thompson. This is different to most tourist venues. To start the wrong end of the attraction, even the toilets are the best in Bangkok, although for men there is the regular Thailand surprise of the female attendant cleaning around you. Entry is very cheap for an attraction at 100 baht each and as the house(s) is tucked down a side street there is a golf buggy shuttle service, navy blue in colour, taking you to the main road junction.Cheap to enter but they make money from the luxurious silk shop and the cafe/restaurant that overlooks a delightful Koi pond. We can recommend the cheesecake and the chocolate cake looked good too. There are more substantial meals too.There is seating to eat inside or outside.The staff are all very elegantly dressed throuout the attraction and you learn the story of silk making from display boards and from actual demonstrations of weaving.The artefacts around the buildings are worth a look and there are free guided tours. To go upstairs you leave your belongings in lockers that are a delight in themselves and there are racks for your shoes. The gardens are also a delight, wonderful shade in the city but of course not cool shade. Perhaps there could have been more places to sit amongst the flora and fauna but the garden is not so big. So Jim, your life was fascinating and so was your disappearance and thank you for the opportunity to visit your house. You would be amazed what they have done to it.If this review was helpful, please vote accordingly"

Also in the courtyard there were several bowls filled with colorful cocoons and a Thai girl dressed in a traditional costume who pretended to be working with silk strings.

After going here if you want to buy fabric their are several material shops, including a Jim Thompson outlet store which I highly recommend, it has 6 floors of fabrics and clothing..... It's a must visit each time I am in Bangkok ( all the curtains in my house are from fabrics bought in the outlet stores, cannot recommend enough) the staff are very knowledgable and they offer the tourist vat return system so take your passport and air details as it needs to be completed at the time of purchase!"

The houses are set in lovely gardens and their is an excellent restaraunt where we enjoyed a relaxed lunch. The story off Jim Thompson and his life is fascinating but Iwill say no more asit will spoil your visit!!"

The setting is lovely too, with lush plants and trees around a series of ponds and narrow winding paths. But the real point of the story is his fascination with Thai textiles, especially silk, which he gradually discovered after settling in to live in Bangkok from 1950 onwards. He single handedly created a new US market for Thai silk and helped the country to build its economy while preserving some of its finest traditions.The compulsory guided to our is excellent, and the site is very well managed. There is also a terrific shop selling silk products and a very pleasant restaurant."

This house located in Bangkok on of the most famous shopping district, very close to MBK and close to Siam Paragon. Before you go shopping there, you can take time enjoying the tour in Jim Thompson house. The house is important for two main reasons. One, it was a tradition thai house, adapted to fit western culture, so if you do have the luxury of visit the normal traditional thai house, this is a good enough example. Second, it was own by The famous Jim Thompson. Also the stuffs he collected is pretty interesting and rare even for Thais point of view. After the tour you can enjoy the lunch at the Jim Thompson coffee house, food here is nice, atmosphere is relaxing, value for money. (If you are lucky, you will see the thai wedding ceremony performs there, since lots of thai couples love to use this place for wedding ceremony.) Before you leave, don't forget to buy some silk product back from the Jim Thompson shop, the quality of silk here is divine!"

You need to know a little about Jim Thompson before you visit this place, its not mandatory though, but it will help you understand better the importance of this place, just to give you a brief intro he was a spy who disappeared mysteriously. There is a shop inside, from where you can buy silk gifts for friends and family members."

The site is reasonably well located, a 5 minute walk from the National Stadium BTS train station. The architecture and antique collection alone is highly impressive, as was a silk making demonstration in the court yard entry. The visit of the house is done as a guided tour, and the guide was gave a very good overview of the life of Jim Thompson and the significance of various rooms and objects in the house. The only thing lacking was an explanation silk making, although there are a series of (kid friendly) display boards, showing the stages of silk production on the ground floor. If time permits, the Jim Thompson cafe/restaurant is well worth a visit, facing back to the house near ornate fish pond. The thai pomelo salad was zesty and yummy!"

He disappeared mysteriously while visiting in the countryside and was never heard of again. The house, furnishings, and gardens are lovely and peaceful.

The elgant understated beauty of the buildings and the furnishings give you glimpses of what it must have been like to have undertaken an exotic adventure during Bangkok's early days and what it must have been like to live in luxury in an exotic location.

The house sits on the back side of a river so you also get a taste of how much life really takes place on the rivers in these countries. I also learned about spirit houses and why the houses are built the way they are! Lovely wood and other artifacts made tho an enjoyable tour."

It is an extraordinary piece of architecture set in a very beautiful and well maintained little garden ,with guided tours every 30 minutes( if I remember correctly). The tour is very interesting and the young guides give a lot of informations ,but sometimes if you get a guide with a strong Thai accent it is very difficult to follow what they say because they must follow a time schedule and they go very fast....I had lots of problems understanding mine...get your information before you visit ...just in case..no pictures allowed inside the houses.There is also a nice little restaurant and a silk shop,but the silk items on sale are very expensive .After my visit I jumped in one of the local boats just in the canal behind J.Thompson house.....there is a stop just a few steps away....what an experience..go for it!"

The house is so beautiful and is full of ancient treasures of Siam. To appreciate this house is to understand how rare Teak houses are now. You also can\u2019t move teak wood from the area that it came from, so this house would not have been possible today. The houses are over 200 years old, the wood is amazing! You have to understand this house was designed in 1956 and was unique for it\u2019s day. Nothing is built like this in Thailand today. If you have the opportunity, do some research before you go to help understand and appreciate how unique this is. The grounds are beautiful, and today are surrounded with some not so beautiful buildings. If you appreciate architecture, you will like this.The gift shop is small, I saw larger JT shops at the mall. The small restaurant is charming and I had the BEST coconut cake I have ever had! I was surprised! While I waited for my tour, stopped for a quick snack, boy was this cake delicious, fresh coconut, fresh cake, it was amazing!"

You really don't need it because the walk isn't that far, but it's a nice little service. You can buy a tour of the house or wander the grounds on your own. The tour guides are very knowledgeable and ours had a great sense of humor. The house you're touring is Jim Thompson's actual house and all the artifacts, furnishings and furniture are his. You get a little lesson about his history and of course there is the shop. Take a peek - if only to get a litte air conditioning.

His home was a fusion of American and Thai aspects of a home. There are many languages of guides available including french, chinese and english of course. In fact, you need a guided tour in order to visit the house. And i would very much recommend the tour because there are totally no signs available to describe each place you are viewing. After the tour, I headed to the restaurant for a meal. The food was good, ambience was great, and the price unbelievable for such an atmosphere. Back home in Singapore, you will probably have to pay $30 sgd at least for each person for such ambience and meal. So go ahead and try!"

The food was awesome and the gardens surrounding the seating area are beautiful.The tour of the Jim Thompson House itself was fantastic. Our guide spoke very good English and emphasised the key words to ensure all the group were following. The tour was a great insight into the Thai silk industry, traditional Thai houses, and the life of Jim Thompson. We loved the architecture and antiques.No photos from inside the main buildings are allowed, but after the tour you are welcome to browse the gardens and take photos from outside.The gardens themselves are amazing, and are a great escape from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok.We highly recommend this attraction to any visitor to Bangkok"

And for us it was just a short walk from our hotel (Asia Hotel).Jim Thompson was an American who post-WW2 developed the silk-weaving industry here. This is the story of him and his house, but I thought more could have been made of the arts and industry of silk-making (the silk is in the shop!). Bar and restaurant attached.You get a language-specific tour guide for a very reasonable entry fee, but then the prices in the souvenir shop are rather high.

And the art collection is equally parts \"Asian\" (Chinese, Burmese) as it is Thai. But all jumbled together, like the six traditional Thai houses that Thompson crammed together to make ONE traditional house, the overall effect remains a richly tropical beauty in its own right. Have been on the tour (guided tour is mandatory, but you can go back to the gardens on your own) years ago,and always wanted to return. Glad I did. It just feels good around here, and the old, oiled hardwood makes the place SMELL good too."

Some of the collection is damaged but each damaged piece has a story that is as fascinating as the man himself. I would also like to say a thank you to the lady who gave the guided tour for us in English on 1st May 2014 at 10:35. I'm sorry I can't remember her name but she was so good, very funny and informative. Oh and proceeds from the house go to a local charity."

You need to walk down a laneway and you at first think you will never get there and just when you feel you need to turn around, you are there. Maybe a bit more signage? It is a paradise there. There were people spinning the cocoons, but no-one on the looms. The house itself is interesting and the grounds lush and tropical. The guides there are informative. Well worth the effort to go. The souvenir shop is expensive and we bought our silk at another centre in Chiang Mai."

The complex of traditional old wooden Thai houses is very beautiful and worth a visit anyway. The food in the restaurant is rather expensive but very very good too."

The home and antiques are absolutely amazing, whether or not you are someone who enjoys looking at antiques, and the gardens are straight our of a magazine. The story of Jim Thompson and the mystery of his death add to the intrigue of this house. So glad we took the time to visit this beautiful home! I just wish the prices of silks and other goods in the store were lower. We did not eat the restaurant, but others who did told us it was delicious."

Although you can enjoy the tour without any background, you will get more out of it by reading up on Jim Thompson before your visit. In any case, you will get some Thai history, art and architecture in one visit to the Thompson house, plus a little mystery and a glimpse into the world of this enigmatic collector. The house itself is beautifully preserved, and the guides are very well prepared and knowledgeable. You will not be disappointed."

The Jim Thompson House and Museum should make an excellent addition to your itinerary while visiting Bangkok.It's located just a few blocks away from the BTS Skytrain stop (National Stadium terminus) in the center of town. Entrance fee is a negligible $3/100 Thai Bath (as of this writing) and includes guided tours that are conducted in English and French. The former house of American Jim Thompson who's popularly known for helping revitalize the Thai Silk industry. It's exemplary of what an upper class Thai home would have resembled in its day -- complete with rare collector pieces. It's quite impressive. Mystery still shrouds Thompson's final days. No one knows what happened to him precisely. Makes a visit to this museum all the more fascinating. It was doubly special for me as I happen to have paid a visit on March 21st, which was coincidentally Mr. Thompson's birthday.This premises is a complex of sorts -- housing a couple shops and onsite restaurant (which happens to be quite decent - if a tad pricy relatively speaking of course). Alternatively, if you'd like to grab lunch after your visit, hop back on the Skytrain one stop in the other direction to Siam. You'll be exiting right at Siam Paragon--Bangkok's mega mall. Descend to the food halls (lower level) for a massive (and relatively inexpensive) assortment of scrumptious delights."

Such a pity that to this day after disappearing in the Cameroon Highlands in Malaysia on Easter Sunday 1967, Jim is still out there somewhere. He was 61 years of age when he went missing. I am 61 years of age now but I'm still here. Maybe it's because I don't work for the CIA. You do the maths. Anyway the house that Jim built in Bangkok is a fascinating place but it would be much more fascinating if you knew a little more about the man himself. I did notice that some of the staff there were not as informed about the man in question. Perhaps I could be your tour guide next time you are in town. I personally don't believe Jim will ever be found and certainly not in our lifetime. Nonetheless yo need to go check this one out for yourself. There's also a restaurant on the property should you want something to eat while you mull over your thoughts."

This house, made from several traditional Thai houses joined together, and set in a peaceful garden is a nice change of pace from the bustle of Bangkok and all of the wats. It is very professionally set up and well organised. Once you have bought your ticket (100\u0e3f each) you will be assigned a time for the guided tour - when we visited it seemed to be within 20 minutes or so, so not a long wait. The guided tour around the house took about 35 minutes. Our guide seemed very knowledgeable and was able to answer questions which were off script, her English was also very good. I think that tours are available in several languages - I definitely heard French spoken as well. I understand why they need to take people around in groups as the house isn't really big enough to accommodate the number of visitors all walking around on their own but with 12 in our group it was difficult to get a good look at everything - maybe going first thing might be less busy and result in smaller group sizes? Bags are not allowed in the main house - lockers are provided and are monitored so I think quite safe."

All belongings were locked (safely) in a locker--so don't bring big bags. The rooms were blocked so you looked through a narrow doorway--which provided limited viewing. I would have loved to tour at my own pace and look around a bit more.The museum display rooms were interesting. The store contained silk and cotton, things for kids and adults. Prices were over the top.It was interesting, but I would not put it on a must stop for a Bangkok trip."

Protesters were camped along the way but security is tight. Turn right on Soi Kasemsan Song #2, pass the Jim Thompson Restaurant and Wine Bar and down just a bit further is the house. It opens at 9:00....consider getting there early and then have a nice lunch or snack after the tour. It will start crowding up around noon. The tours last 35 minutes and you must take a tour to see the inside. You are allowed only water and a camera (which can not be used inside) on the tour and keyed lockers are provided for your other items. The home is a wonderful oasis of peace...except when the long tail boats zoom by in the canal next to it.

I walked from the nearest BTS, which was a small 5 minute walk. Easy to find.  Each room in this spectacular heaven is worth a visit. I'v never walked into someones dining room and fallen in love with the table. Which as I recall, is apparently a Chinese ping-pong table as eating at a table wasn't the norm in Thailand. As silly as it sounds, I could quite easily pack up my things, and just squat in this oasis till I'm eventually kicked out with force. For anyone who's passion is creativity, this is a gem.  The guide spoke good english, french, and spanish as I recall. She was knowledgable about Jim Thompson and his home, and was happy to answer any question I threw at her! She had a smile on her face all throughout the trip, which added to the grand experience. Price was good, 50B for under 25s, 100B for over. Which is well worth what you receive. Restaurant prices were good, depends on your taste. Try the mango and lime smoothy, its by far the most delicious drink to grace my lips. I ordered a Thai Tom Yum Goong and was a delight. If I could have finished it all I would have, but it was so filling and the portions were a little too big.  The on site store was full on things for everyone. For those with a bit more walking around money will be in for a treat, with some lovely hand crafted bags, scarves, and sarongs. Overall, a definite visit if you're in Bangkok. More informative and beautiful than fun, not sure if it's good for children. Heaven!"

Also, there are several historic art pieces in the house but the guide had very little to say about them nor the history of the silk trade. Her English was not good either. The gift shop is where you can buy silk items made by locals on the premises. The prices are a little higher than what you can find in other sections of Bangkok and but the workmanship is very good. There is a small restaurant on the grounds but we didn't eat there. The tour lasted slightly more than an hour. It was a fun way to spend a couple of hours as part of a day trip and the grounds and gardens are very nice. It's easy to reach via the sky train National Stadium stop. It's only a 500 yard walk down a small side street to the location."

There are golf carts that pick you up off the main street or it is a short distance to walk. I walked down and rode back. The house is beautiful. There are lockers to put your \"stuff\" in. The tour was excellent. The shop is very nice but is like the ones at the airport. They have a place to eat and the food was very good. I do recommend this as a stop. It did not take long and was very interesting!!"

Exit where you see the Ibis/Mercure Hotel. At the bottom of the stairs of the BTS, make a U-turn and walk up to the next corner, turn right and go all the way to the end of the soi. The entire area of the grounds is not very big, it is rather compact. But what you will find is a number or original Thai houses the Jim Thompson moved to this site for his home. Once you purchase a ticket, they will put you into groups based on your language, and give you a time for the start of the guided tour. They will ask you what language tour you want to join. English or Thai will be the most featured. The tour guides are very knowledgeable and will give you a complete history of Mr. Thompson and how he developed the silk industry in Thailand. Also on the grounds is a Jim Thompson store and a Jim Thompson Restaurant. The canal runs right by the property, so take a look at that also. Restrooms on the property and seating around the grounds also. It is a great tour to learn about some history of the silk trade and the American that developed it for Thailand."

After traipsing around the concrete city that Bangkok has become, Jim Thompson's House takes you back to what the city must have looked like years ago. My wife and I took the tour on January 19, 2014. The tropical gardens were a respite from the nearby mall land (which at that time was surrounded by the protests from the Bangkok Shutdown). The house is a beautiful wooden house built on stilts like the traditional Thai houses to protect the living quarters from the floods in the rainy seasons. The tour was very informative, explaining such things as why all Thai houses (and our hotel room) have a beam at the bottom of the door to prevent evil spirits from entering. In addition, we found the people spinning silk from the silkworm cocoons outside the house fascinating.Only lacking was a discussion of Mr. Thompson's mysterious disappearance in the highlands of Malaysia. Was he \"disappeared\" by the CIA? Or did he stage his own disappearance so he could sail away to a mysterious island a la Captain Nemo? All and all, a very nice way to while away an hour or so in Bangkok."

Compulsory 40 mts or so \"tour\" inside the building is rather rigid especially if you visit in peak season (maybe not much of a problem in quiet or less crowded time), and one probably cannot pick a guide to go with, or know the time of tour to take before arriving at the premise, or seeing the place at your own pace, so one's luck in finding this place interesting depend on them. We were made to wait for about 30mts (being encouraged to spend time and money in adjoining shop and or cafe restaurant). Before applying for a tour, we had a lunch at an adjoining restaurant because there were not much place for stopping by from the BTS station to the house. With like-minded visitors, the place was busy and orders came late for pad thais (which somewhat tasted ketchupy?!) and drinks. It seems there are guides on volunteer and professional basis, and fluency in language and art/architectural/historical interest/knowledge vary per person. Don't go with a limited timeframe thinking you could breeze through this premise."

It was a little bit of peace in a hot, humid and bussling Bangkok with a great story and architecture to boot. I highly recommend a visit. It is not far from MBK shopping mall, say about 5-10mins and down a side street (there is a shuttle from JT house to the main road). We ate at the little cafe there and it was very good.Definitely a goer if you are nearby in Bangkok."

However, it is great to get more insight in the Thai culture, traditions and Jim Thompsons life. There is an admission fee but you do get a 40min tour. You're not allowed to discover the house by yourself so I would suggest to be there early so you don't have to wait too long for the tour to start. 40 minutes was in my opinion not enough time to discover all the art in the house but if you are in Bangkok for a few days this is a must-see!"

The house itself is beautiful, all wood, and a very surprising sight in the middle of Bangkok, especially at the end of a grubby street. The house also has a lovely gift shop attached, which is pricey by comparison with other silk products you can buy in Bangkok/ Thailand, but you're paying for the name. I'd say the quality of the items is probably better than many of the other items you can buy in the city, and particularly much better than anything you'd get in the markets - the silk is finer, the detailing neater and the finish better. They keep a lovely range of items including handbags, purses, ties, dressing gowns/ robes, soft toys, and household items like placemats. A lovely place to visit for some respite from the craziness of the city."

Even if I had seen it then, I would returned and seen it again on this last trip, it is that remarkable. Yes I admit I am a lover of Thai teak houses, but this place was truly exceptional. Jim Thompson was an American who slowly rebuilt the Thai silk industry, generating publicity for the product in Europe and America. He found 6 old teak houses and brought them together in this complex, some of the houses merging to form his main house, others changed to form other outer buildings such as his study. Set in a lush tropical garden, right on a klong (canal), it is easily found in the warren of streets surrounding it, just ask any friendly local for directions if you get lost.The house has been kept as Jim Thompson left it, furnished with the antiques he found all over SE Asia, his favourites seeming to be Buddha statues that had been damaged in some way. There are frequent guided tours, very informative, but remember once you are inside the house you cannot take photos. There is also a terrific restaurant and a gift shop inside the complex. Hard to believe you are in the middle of a bustling city while you sit relaxing with a Thai iced coffee, in the beautiful surroundings of the house and garden.Make the time to visit it, the extra bit of allure being that Jim Thompson disappeared in the jungles of Malaysia in 1967 while visiting friends there. No-one knows what happened to him, and his house was left to a foundation for the people of Thailand."

The mansion is inside the compound and near to the garden after the restaurant.Attraction Tip: There are free shuttle to and from the mansion to the National Stadium BTS station. You may try to take note on the shuttle at the mouth of the Soi to get a free ride. After buying the entrance ticket with the receipt, then heading to the garden and you need to pass the receipt at another counter at the back left corner near the garden for guide allocation. The counter will provide you a number or alphabet and a time schedule for your guide. There is waiting time where you can walk around and take some photos around the mansion because photos and footwear are not allowed inside the mansion."

From rooms decorated with salvaged stone Buddhas to a dining room filled with luxurious yet authentic Chinese porcelain, Jim Thompson's house is a rare glimpse into the architectural history of Southeast Asia. The only disappointing thing is that Mr. Thompson, who disappeared without a trace in Malaysia in 1967, cannot be here to witness the effect his brilliant silk business or preserved house has made in Thailand."

It's one thing to know how old something is, but it's completely a different thing to hear the story of what the item is, and how Jim came to get it.

We did stop and have a coffee and smoothie and they were excellent. The ambiance is wonderful and the peace and quiet just what the doctor ordered to renew your batteries. We wanted to wander in the garden, not to visit the house again, but you now have to buy a ticket for the house to do this. A great shame as it is still an ''oasis of peace' in this manic city."

There are some small animations organized in the house to show you how silk is made and how Thai classical dance looks like. There was also a modern stitching exhibition above the shop, I did not like the styles but the theme was interesting.To people who find the shop overpriced, well for me it was still half the price as in my home country for the same quality and we got the VAT refund in the airport, so I guess that sometimes if you want silk or pashmina you have to pay for it or you will end up with fake products. We chose some cushion covers, purse, hat..To finish we went to the restaurant and enjoyed the meal fully!For information there is a free shuttle from and to the BTS station (National Stadium), though it is totally a walk able distance if you miss it!"

Jim Thompson actually run free shuttle golf carts to and from the sky train station to the house but we didn't realise this when we came out of the sky train station.The house and gardens are a little tropical oasis situated up a side street in chaotic Bangkok. The tour of the house is very informative and interesting and the gardens are beautiful. There is a lovely restaurant where you can sit and take in the beautiful surroundings. There is also an excellent shop with an extensive range of silk products where my daughter and I treated ourselves to a beautiful silk scarve each.

An extraordinary hideaway in high rise modern Bangkok. The graciousness of the tour guides exemplifies so much of Thai culture, and the insight into Thai architecture and one man's role in recording and restoring that aspect of the culture is inspiring. The silks are amazing, even more so when we later visited the Jim Thompson outlet store.... five floors of silks and silk clothing.the varieties and patterns are mindblowing... which I think is an extraordinary statement coming from a man! Worth a visit. Be prepared to just relax and take it all in."

To be true to his concept he built his home joining several original houses together. These are beautifully maintained with much of his belongings on display. Guides are fluent in most common languages and types are grouped together the guides giving a very knowlegible tour.

It has a real cozy feel to it and at least for me, a fascinating mix of ceramics and Buddhist statues and paintings throughout. I'd like to live there! The garden is quite lush. You must go on a guided tour inside the house but it is worth it as they explain a lot of things you would not have known. It takes about 1/2 hour. And its only THB 100 (a little over US$3). Had a nice lunch of a Thai salad on the outside terrace facing the house next to a sleepy fish pond. There is also a shop as well as another gallery with changing exhibits upstairs. Bathroom was very clean and you can smoke in a special place right by the entrance."

It's essentially the preserved house (or collection of houses and art) of an American architect, OSS operative and ultimately Orientalist and investor in the Thai Silk industry following the second world war. Given credit for revitalizing the industry and bringing to prominence in the wider world. The houses are beautiful traditional wooden houses on stilts, rendered in beautiful teak and other dark hard woods and a beautiful synthesis of Thai craft and western tastes. One of the most beautiful houses I've ever visited, set in still lush oasis in the heart of Bangkok. The guides are well informed and well spoken and the museum is well developed and obviously well funded. Take the Skytrain to Rathachewi station and walk across the bridge and down the canal side to the right to get there. Be sure though to check out the great selection of little restaurants on the station side of the bridge after Jim Thompson's house, beautiful curries, tom yum soup and pork and basil stir fries."

Once your in the main road just wait for the Tuk Tuk pickup and the Tuk Tuk itself comes with clear writing: JIM THOMPSON. So you dont have to walk or yes you can walk too.This JT House have their handicraft store, restaurant/cafe. When you enter please pay at the right side of the entrance for entrance fee, then walk further pass the JT shop and there you will see lots of tour guide using their traditional Thai uniform. The tour is for free (included in the entrance fee). Please also choose your language for the tour. There will be: Japanese, English and Mandarin.They will explain the reason for the house architecture, they will explain why they have statue of Headless Buddha. . .to me this is very very interesting. I think its a must to see JT House if you're in Bangkok. . .Cheers. . ."

Short but informative guided tour, interesting story of Jim Thompson, his achievements and mysterious disappearance. Yes the shop is expensive but the products are good just to look at. Had desert and drinks in the excellent cafe, recommend the sticky rice with mango. Finished off our trip with a walk and boat ride along the adjacent canal. Would recommend as a way to see how people really live."

I was attracted to go to the museum because I read that it was a combination of history and a walk in a garden. The garden was not how I imagined it to be, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. If you are into architecture/art/design/interior, you'd enjoy a visit to the Jim Thompson House. The house is gorgeous, and I admire that they've managed to preserve so much detail from the past. When you arrive, you can purchase your tour tickets and then wait for your turn. They divide visitors into groups by language - there was English, of course, and Japanese. I'm not sure what other language they may offer. For me, the tour around the house itself wasn't that long, but it wasn't a rushed one either. I was able to really admire and take in the surroundings, and our tour guide was more than happy to answer any questions we may have.After the tour, drop by the boutique for some shopping before you leave or watch how Thai silk is made. Pretty fascinating.An excellent place for a laid-back tour."

We were on a tour with a woman who was not watching her child at all and he was crawling all over Thompson's priceless antiques, picking up statuettes and offerings in a spirit house. It was very stressful for the group and the Thai tour guide who was too polite to ask them to leave. The Jim Thompson shop has very beautiful things but they were 2 - 3x more expensive than things we found at a silk factory store outside Chiang Mai. I'm sure there are similar factories outside Bangkok if you are looking to buy a lot of silk as gifts, etc. The restaurant was quite good but also very expensive for a meal in Thailand."

This man was into thai silk and lived in this house which he created by linking old houses already there with other old houses in the thai style which he transported there from other parts of the country to make the large home in which he lived. As an architect by profession he did a really tasteful job and further enhanced the place by furnishing it with wonderful old thai objects and furnishings sympathetic to the thai way of living. The only exception to this was his dining table. He eschewed dining on the floor thai style and formed his rectangular dining table by placing two antique mahjong tables side by side. The house is seen by a formal tour which was excellent. There is a wonderful shop in which you can purchase the silk wares - irresistable."

While I knew very little about Thai silk and Jim Thompson, I decided to visit in order to see the way he integrated Western and Thai approaches towards architecture. The tour guide explained the ways in which he tweaked traditional Thai building practices, such as connecting the rooms in the house and turning window panels inward so that he could enjoy the intricate carving. It was fascinating to look at all of the items that he collected before his disappearance, and the garden was beautiful. After the tour, you're allowed to wander the garden and first floor at your leisure and take photographs. No photography is allowed in the rest of the house, nor shoes for that matter.The restaurant is reasonably priced, though the products in their store are quite costly. Of note, their woolen, modal, and rayon scarves are all made in Kashmir; I'm not sure about the linen. The place accepts credit cards, and the staff will fill out VAT forms and explain how to get your money back at customs. I finished the bulk of my Christmas shopping in the span of 30 minutes.If you're strapped for time, this place isn't necessarily a must-see. Still, for 100 THB, it's well worth a visit if you have an hour or two to spare. It's super accessible--the shuttle from National Stadium to the House is superfluous if you're willing to walk for three minutes or so."

We stayed in Sukhumvit Soi 4 ( Ibis Nana ), so our home BTS is Nana (E3).From Nana BTS, the cost is around 38 or 42 THB per person. Exchange your Baht (THB) bank notes into coins in your BTS station, read guidance in the wall to determine your distance and fee, then Insert your coin into ticket vending machine. Insert your trip card, search for \"To Mo Chit\" sign, go upstairs and there you go to Siam exchange BTS station. In Siam BTS, get off from your Sukhumvit Line train, search for National Stadium sign and get into the Silom Line Train the platform. In National Stadium (W1), take the exit 1 ( actually you can read it in the sign direction ), from the stairs, turn left, walk past Mercure Ibis Hotel then you'll find Soi Kasemsan 2 on your right side. Walk on, then you'll see the house at about 200 meters from the main road. Charge : 100 Thb, with english speaking guide. Souvenirs store, cage is available. To store your belongings is mandatory, including taking off shoes. The house is nicely built from wooden; actually there are several houses in one complex, combining traditional Thai and western influences. There are so many collection to see in this house, unfortunately, taking pics inside is prohibited. If you have three days to spend in Bangkok and you plan to go to Siam/National Stadium area, DO NOT skip this spot. There is a shuttle car to bring you back and forth from Jim Thompson\u2019s house to the main road, near National Stadium BTS.Nearby, you could visit MBK Shopping Mall or National Art and Gallery.

What I found intriguing was the story of Jim, an American architect,who not only transformed the Thai silk industry but also left this house as a heritage to later generations. The mysterious disappearance, even today there is no clue about this, adds to one's fascination. The paintings, sculptures and ceramics that Jim collected, are tastefully displayed throughout the house. Your experience is enhanced by a knowledgeable guide who speaks understandable English.

We paid for the tour and only later was informed of the time. As we had time constraints, we skipped the tour (we did not ask for a refund as we were not sure if they would entertain our request) and headed to the retail outlet and the restaurant instead.The retail outlet had quite a range of products available from household to clothing. However cut fabric is not available here (to my disappointment). The restaurant was full as it was lunch hour. We needed to wait a bit. If you come in a big group, the wait will be longer. They had a nice selection of Thai dishes. It is a bit pricey but you pay for the ambiance of the place. Service is a bit slow but then again, perhaps they do not expect tourists to be in a hurry.We will go back again for the tour if we have the time in future. This time we shall use the train and get that free shuttle ride."

We enjoyed the traditional silk manufacturing process very much, as an Australian parent who had to find Mulberry leaves for school silk worm projects it was good to see the other end of the process.The restaurant was a little disorganised but the food was great in a really pleasant setting overlooking a carp pond."

He is somewhat iconic and quite well known here - there is a Jim Thompson silk store at Siam Paragon, he's been used in Thailand ad campaigns, a line of fabric collections uses his name - and the list goes on. However, I had not ever had the opportunity to visit the Jim Thompson House. There are just so many \"must sees\" in Bangkok and with my work schedule, time was limited. I don't think this is a \"must see\" on a first trip to Bangkok if you are visiting for just a short time - but it is very, very interesting - both for this insight about Jim Thompson's life, as well as for the architecture of the house and gardens. Jim Thompson was an American architect who was a military intelligence officer in Bangkok - he returned to Thailand after he left the service. He was known primarily for two accomplishments. First, he focused on reviving the silk industry in Thailand and was instrumental in creating worldwide demand for Thai silk. Second, he is known for the construction of this house which follows and respects the principles of Thai architecture. The house is actually a collection of houses that come from all over Thailand and were reassembled as one house in Bangkok. When the house became the focus of interest, he opened it to the public and donated the money he received to Thai charities that emphasized preserving Thai culture. Jim Thompson disappeared while in Malaysia - there have never been any clues about what happened to him.If time permits, this is definitely worth a visit. It's a lovely, interesting home in a peaceful, serene setting - right in the middle of the bustle of Bangkok. Very easy walk from MBK and/or National Stadium stop on the BTS."

Other than the art collectibles and architecture to observe, the gardens are really nice with fish and water turtles around! In addition to that observing the process of silk making was really interesting, and I dunno if we were just lucky but there was also an exhibition on the top floor near the entrance.

I am an amateur Asian decorative art collector so I have some knowledge about the subject, there is some valuable pieces in there but unless you really appreciate antique scroll paintings, dinner ware etc you may find it a tad boring. The best pieces from his collection are long gone. You must follow a tour group through the house which we found boring at times. Our guide said \"Jim Thompson\" in every sentence often several times. It just felt a bit \"dumbed down\", it reminded me of school group tours. My wife and I were wearing sandals so that meant bare foot on the tour as you must take off your shoes, which we find kind of gross. How this country avoids a foot wart and atheletes foot epidemic is beyond me. They have a good air conditioned gift shop with much higher quality tourist merchandise than most tourist stops we visited. I have been to 25 countries and seen many amazing places so I guess I am getting hard to impress. An hour was enough for us. I wouldn't send my friends there."

The guides have memorized a 2 pages paper (which is also passed to you) and they will circle you in the rooms and tell stories! about the magical American that has disappeared!!Good job making a scam and creating job for all those people (similar to Taxi and Tuktuk drivers in Bangkok). I also suspect some of the excessive positive reviews here are fake."

The history of the Thompson center is in itself an amazing journey thru this gentlemans life. His entrepreneur thought not only brought the Thai people an economy it made him an humble contributor to the greater mankind. The home is simply amazing and forward in thought and structure. It's art can be adorned in anyone's perspective. It's use of bringing nature inward is clearly accomplished in the foot print of the homes design. For a couple hours one can indulge in pure genius while exploring the perfect place, in the perfect setting of a traditional modern Thai Home"

The tour of his home is a lovely way to spend a morning followed by lunch at the on-site restaurant which is reasonable and very good. I think the best souvenirs of the place are the reproduction paintings of Buddha's life.

We had previously been to Bangkok, in January 2005, but missed out on going to this attraction, so it was a must for the next trip to Bangkok, which, I must say, is probably my favourite city.Walking from National Stadium skyway station, many touts/drivers greet you with the message that Jim Thompson House is closed on a Monday or doesn't open until 1.00pm. Once you get over this and arrive there, Jim Thompson House provides quite an amazing insight into the life of a very interesting man.The guided tour shows the splendour of the architecture of the house which feels to be an oasis in the middle of a vibrant, bustling city. It is not difficult to imagine having guests for a dinner party and being in an escape from all outside pressures.The life of Jim Thompson which ended with his disappearance in the possible context of being a spy, is fascinating.The most interesting facet of his life was that he revived the Thai silk industry.I purchased a Jim Thompson tie designed with outlines of hundreds of elephants. Every time I wear that tie, comments are made and a story begins.I think that once is enough for a lifetime memory but definitely include Jim Thompson house on any agenda to visit Bangkok.John & Pam WillisBeaumaris,Victoria,Australia"

When you mention where your going they tell you that it's closed. No matter if it's JT's House, The Grand Palace, The Temple. We did a test and said we were going to Tescos. You know what they said ........... it's closed on Monday's. So head straight to where your going. When we got to the Lane of JT's house they have a big notice up saying 'We are open every day\".

Thompson obviously loved Thai culture as he help revitalize Thailand's silk industry. He built this house in Bangkok by combining 6 tradtional Thai houses together.It's a short walk from Nat'l Stadium BTS. There is even a golf-cart shuttle for the lazy or exhausted. I arrived, paid the entry fee. There were women in Traditional Thai garb demonstrating silk production. One woman was spinning silk from the worm cocoons - really cool to see this even if it is just a staged demonstration. Once it was time for the English tour, 20-or-so of us were taken through the house by a pleasant guide with good English. The house is really unique and it's cool to imagine Jim Thompson building it, furnishing it, and living there. After the tour you're free to wander the grounds or visit the restaurant or bar. (restaurant is recommended in my guidebook, but it was a little over my budget)A little silly is the Jim Thompson gift shop where you can buy Jim Thompson shirts, Jim Thompson ties, Jim Thompson wallets, Jim Thompson scarves, Jim Thompson Limited Edition Silk Boxer shorts - - you get the idea.the house makes a nice, chill visit. the house is an oasis of calm and beauty in the urban jungle of Bangkok"

Although slightly difficult to find (our taxi driver seemed to have no idea what or where it was) it's definitely worth seeking out if your around Siam Square. The buidlings are beautiful and have been very sympathetically preserved and converted into what is now clearly a popular tourist attraction. You have to be part of a guided tour to look round the main house. Our guide was very knowledgable and sweet. The tour takes around 40 mins, during which time you learn more about Jim Thompson, his life in Thailand, his business and of course the house he built in Bangkok. He had great taste and the house is full of wonderful antiques and statues. Only criticism is that you don't get to find out that much about the traditional technique for silk production, although on the way out a chap was doing a demo using traditional apparatus which was interesting. We had lunch at the cafe which was very tasty and a lovely spot to sit and relax. Well worth it."

Let the record show that I saw at least 10 staff members, all presumably on-the-clock, before our tour even started. It\u2019s nice to know that 100 baht admission is going towards keeping the unemployment rate low.Our tour group was not scheduled to depart for about 20 minutes, so I meandered through the Jim Thompson bar / restaurant, used the Jim Thompson bathroom, walked through the Jim Thompson souvenir shop, and pondered why a short sleeve shirt with blue elephants and a Jim Thompson logo cost 2,400 baht (about $80 USD). A Jim Thompson silk neck tie, at 2,100 baht (about $70 USD), made me want to use the man\u2019s name as an expletive.The tour itself is efficient enough. A Thai woman (apparently all the tour guides were Thai women) introduced herself, and started talking about \u201cMr. Thompson\u201d in an almost deified way. From memory, she told the story of the man\u2019s life before and while in Thailand, replete with details that weren\u2019t on the half-page handout. It was clear from the first few moments that the recitation was just that, seemingly involving few actual emotions for a man from another country who had lived and died before she was born, yet was the reason she had a job."

There are pretty gardens, fish ponds, brick walk ways, restaurant, bar, gift shop, etc. You do not have to book in advance. Just show up and they place you in the next available tour. Very fair price. Many attentive employees to assist you and point you in the right direction. There is a free shuttle that runs from the main road down the alley to the Jim Thompson house and back. Street alley is safe and clean. Traditional Thai dancers on site for short performances while you enjoy a drink or relax near the fish ponds. I would go back just to enjoy the ponds, gardens and get away from the city a bit.CONS: Our English tour guide had a very thick/heavy accent and I couldn't understand much of what she said so I got bored. Tour is quick and very basic info provided. Wish they provided more details and a deeper history on who he was or how he turned the Thai silk industry around. The house is on a canal and the boats that drive by every few minutes are SO loud and disrupt the tour."

The entry price was 100 baht which included the (mandatory, I think?) guided tour in English. Our group was about 10 and the tour lasted 40 minutes, starting 15 minutes after I arrived; the guide was fine/good - explaining bits of the late owner's life as well as information about the architecture and art around the house. The house itself is beautiful and, as people say, has a nice forest-like garden. There are stairs, and there's a fair bit of climbing into rooms (there is a slightly raised barrier at each doorway - we were told its traditional, and helpful for keeping evil spirits and babies - respectively - contained in one room) - something to know if your mobility is impaired.You have to leave your bags locked up (in CCTV-monitored lockers, which only you have the lock to.) Some people seemed freaked out at the idea \"but I have my passport in there!\" - so either wear something with pockets big enough to hold your wallet, or be comfortable locking your stuff. It seemed very secure and our group had no problems. A little wilted after a day out (there are fans in the house, but it's still warm), I ate at the restaurant. It was reasonably priced (180 baht for chicken and cashew nuts, 30 baht for jasmin rice with it), quiet, nicely decorated and cool. There is a American food on the menu as well. There's also a bar area if you want to side outside. Shop is full of beautiful, higher-than-you're-used-to-seeing-priced things (probably very good value for money - I don't know the price of quality silk!) The company appears to be a well-run brand; you get Jim Thompson branded bottled water in the restaurant, and the shop feels quite posh.Very easy access to the National Stadium station. I was dropped off in a taxi (200 baht from grand palace in traffic) but walked the 5 minutes back to the BTS.I would 100% recommend it as a relaxing, interesting place to spend 2 hours. Don't bring your kids - I think they'd be bored."

It's a little jewel in the city which is hidden away but should be sought out. The guided tour we had was excellent and is available in Thai, English and French and the group sizes were not too big. Our guide (sadly can't remember her name) was superb and knew her history and information and was able to answer all questions thrown at her. It was surprising to find out at the end that she is a trainee so I'm sure the more experienced guides would be even more knowledgeable. Jim Thompson played an important role in Bangkok's history so unless you are just in the city for the night life and to create your own Wolfpack, it's worth learning about the man and visiting his stunning home."

For those of us who have seen it before, there are photo oppotunities to see how silk is unravelled from cocoons and see Thai dancing.

Since I first visited Jim Thompson's House in 1995, tourist traffic has increased ten fold, and this popular Bangkok attraction has developed into a far more sophisticated site, with a smart gift shop, a bar and restaurant, and entertainment in the courtyard in the form of Thai dancers and weavers spinning silk from silkworm cocoons. The queues in the height of the European summer holidays are astounding, but it was still only a twenty minute wait, and well worth the effort. (although be advised to take a fan and plenty of water). Jim Thompson's House is a museum of SE Asian art: Bencharong & Ming porcelain, Burmese and Thai sculptures, a Belgian chandelier, and a dining table once used by King Rama V of Thailand. But for me, the most beautiful artefact is the house itself, which he constructed from six old Thai teak houses just across the klong from where the Thai silk weavers worked on their looms. Over 200 years old, the wooden floorboards are worn but polished. Surrounded by a dense garden, it is a haven from the hustle and bustle of the huge city behind its walls.Jim Thompson, godfather to the Thai silk industry, was an American architect who first came to Thailand during WWII. When he left the army he returned to Bangkok, where he became fascinated with the locally manufactured silk, then a flagging industry. He took samples back to the States and had soon established a thriving business in Thai silks, now recognized and adored around the world. Take a look!"

You'll see a hodge-podge of Thai art and architecture here. It may not be for the purist (it was assembled by an American businessman, after all), but it's very interesting. We capped the tour with a visit to the onsite store, which may be a tourist trap, but certainly sells some high-quality merchandise.Overall, highly recommended as a break from the big temples, big malls, and busy streets of Bangkok."

After visiting the house, I would recommend you walk towards the canal, turn right and head for the water taxi stop along the Khlong Saen Saep.

The home itself is really lovely and full of artifacts and art, but the best part is all of the things you learn along the guided tour (which is mandatory). The tour guide tells you so much about the Jim Thompson story, Thai architecture, Thai culture, and you even learn quite a bit about regional art styles. Really great tour - I totally recommend it. Beautiful and very informative! (If you want to buy a souvenir or something, check out the outlet stores instead of the gift shop!)"

Just take the Silom Line Skytrain to it's terminus at the National Stadium, walk down the right-hand side staircase onto Rama I Road and turn into Soi Kasem San 2 - it's well sign posted. A short walk down this soi (lane) will bring you to the Klong (canal) San Saeb where the house is located on the left. Jim Thompson resurrected the Thai silk industry and his weavers were housed on the opposite side of the klong. He was a great collector - in fact the House is a collection of smaller houses and buildings which he purchased and transported from upcountry to reassemble as a whole in Bangkok. He also collected many examples of Thai art and crafts which form a wonderful museum today. This house provides the visitor the chance to visit an old traditional Thai house right in the middle of the city. Jim Thompson disappeared without trace whilst on holiday in the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. This remains one of Asia's greatest mysteries still today. Books on his life and disappearance are on sale in the souvenir shop."

BTS was a better option than taxi as we found it difficult to find a driver who knew where it was.  Admission is 100Baht which includes a mandatory guides tour. The 30 minute tour provides an interesting snap shot of how this one man, an American, restored Thai silk production from a cottage industry to a global export following WWII. His very interesting home contains some very beautiful historical Thai artifacts. The gardens are also very beautiful to walk through. There is a nice shop you can purchase silk and cotton fabrics and merchandise as well as a small bookstore and a restaurant."

We took the BTS (Silom Line) to the National Stadium station and walked a short distance through a narrow Soi (street) to the Jim Thompson House. I was impressed by how organized and well-staffed the place was. There were people to greet you, to show you where to go next and to give you a tour of the place. We arrived at 915am and we were included in the compulsory tour (available in English, French and Japanese) at 930am. We were joined by 4 adults and 3 toddlers. The guide first showed us the exterior of the house then we left our shoes and bags in secure lockers and toured the interior of the house. The guide spoke okay English with a light Thai accent so she was understandable. She did not just point out the sights but gave us an insight on how Thais interpret them (ie. the broken antiques JT collected were seen as bad luck). She was able to entertain us and the curious toddlers at the same time so kudos to her skills:) It was a short tour, around 30-40 minutes and you have time to stroll around the grounds afterwards. There is a bookstore and a gift store but the items were mostly out of our budget so we just looked around. Since it was drizzling, we availed of the free shuttle service (golf cart) that took us back to the BTS station where we took a taxi towards our next destination.In conclusion, it was a good tour in a beautiful house surrounded by mystery and superstition (did i mention that accdg to JT's horoscope, he was supposed to be extra careful when he is 61 years old... the same age he disappeared?!). The tour guides were experienced, the staff courteous, the location accessible and the price reasonable (100 baht). I highly recommend this to visitors in Bangkok."

An American who became a permanent resident of Thailand, his house is a lasting reminder of the man who did what he can to contribute in the preservation of Thai art and culture. The structure of the house itself adheres to traditional Thai architecture, and the interiors are finished and decorated using pieces salvaged and bought from old Thai palaces and houses. Also within the grounds of the compound is a small garden and a couple more smaller structures housing some Thai artifacts; there is also a restaurant and a boutique selling silk products (clothes, bags, accessories) carrying the Jim Thompson brand. 100 Baht entitles visitors to an English guided tour around the house; our tour guide was a pleasant Thai lady with a genuine smile. Thai folk dancing is also performed outside and the traditional way of spinning silk threads are shown to visitors.The Jim Thompson house can easily be reached via BTS. Take a train and alight at the National Stadium station. Get out via Exit 1 and walk towards Mercure Ibis Hotel and Lub D Siam Hostel. The street towards the house is immediately right after this and will take a couple minutes walk."

            "review": "Definitely unique museum and well-managed. I've always wanted to visit the Jim Thompson House Museum in Bangkok but in my last few trips there, I couldn't quite find it. I knew it was within walking distance from the infamous MBK but only until I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express was I able to find it (it's right behind the hotel).Jim Thompson is a famous American credited with bringing renown to beautiful Thai silk. After the second world war, Jim Thompson made Thailand his home until his mysterious disappearance at Cameron Highlands, in Malaysia. There definitely is a sense of charm and mystery to the legend who is Jim Thompson and his beautiful home now turned into a museum adds depth to his tale.At 100 baht, a visit includes a must-do guided tour with some free time to explore the gardens. There's also a shop and restaurant, and a free art gallery if you're not inclined to tour the home (though really it shouldn't be missed if you've never been). The tour takes around 45 minutes or so and is quite nicely done. What we see as one house is really an assemblage of various old Thai wooden houses combined. The guide will point out the unique architectural details, and provide a sneak peek into traditional Thai living blended with Western creature comforts.I definitely found the visit to be insightful and interesting. The objects and artifacts left behind speak volumes of the life of Jim Thompson. His flair for art and beauty is evident and you can't fault him for falling in love with Thailand. Photos are not allowed in the house but can be taken outside and in the gardens."

They have a buggy service to drive you from the main road in though the walking distance was rather short. The admission fee was reasonable. ISIC card holders & those below 25 get 50% discount off. We were assigned to a group with other visitors for the tour conducted in English. You can't wander around the higher level of the house without being accompanied by a guide. The tour takes you around the entire house & the guide assigned to our group spoke very well. The guides are well trained & do not hesitate to ask them any questions should you have any. The entire compound looks beautifully preserved & there are lots of photo taking opportunities at the external compound. Once inside, they are extremely strict on enforcing the no photography rule. A korean couple was berated for flouting this rule. The guide will explain the origin of some of the artifacts stored in each room and comment on the inspiration for the design or layout of particular rooms. Mr Thompson infused both elements of western & thai culture when he built the house. I recommend a visit to this place if you are spending more than 3 days in bkk. Otherwise, I think you may want to give this attraction a miss in favour of others like Wat Arun and Siriraj Medical Museum."

You must join an organised tour - a guide then takes you to a number of rooms in the houses of Jim Thompson - explanations of the style and decor are given. This tour takes about 30 minutes. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. There are two gift shops where you can purchase literature or silk products. There is also a cafe on the grounds. The house backs the klong, or canal - where water taxis stir up the murky water. I suggest you go earlier than later in the day - we arrived in time for the 10 am tour - after this time things got really busy."

As others have commented, the contrast with the surrounding city adds to the experience.While pleasant, our guide seemed one step up from English-language students practicing their new-found language. Though we could understand her sufficiently well, I overheard another guide who I would not have been able to understand consistently. Acknowledging that this is not an English-speaking country, nonetheless, at a well-established attraction on the upper end of the cost spectrum, I'd encourage improvement in that area.Kudos to the sweet girl manning the shoe lockers who gave our son an origami-style paper top she had made. Then, after we expressed interest, she spent nearly an hour showing him and my wife how to make them. Other guides wandered over during their free time (the attraction was not busy) and joined in, with one making a nifty paper elephant for us. Very charming people and a nice place to visit!"

You cannot take photos inside the house, only on the ground level and within the gardens, which is fair enough. The architecture is fascinating and despite being fairly small, the garden was dense with beautiful flowers, fish ponds and palms. I read a couple of review from people who couldn't find the house! bizarre really as it's around a 3-5 minute walk from the BTS station (national stadium) Take exit 1, turn round and head back along the road. Take the first road on the right and the house is at the end of this road on the left hand side. No problem!It cost 100 baht for the entrance ticket and guided tour, which I think is a great price!"

The Skytrain line that ends at the national stadium station is just 5 minutes walk from this attraction. As you depart the station go west towards the end of the line staying on the north side (right hand side as you look west). Once you are down on ground level you turn back on yourself and will walk along Rama Thanon and after a minute or two will see a small sign on a post in the pavement pointing to Jim Thompson's house.As you walk into the side street (Kasemsan 2) you may see a small shuttle buggy (just like a golf buggy) that will run you to the house but it is under 3 minutes walk up the street to the attraction on the left hand side.Entry fee is 100 Baht for adults and 50 for students and certain others. Perhaps the most delightful part is the yard. Do not miss the Koi in the pond and there are some other ponds too.You will be allocated a time for a guided tour (40 minutes) in you language. All major languages catered for. Frankly it was informative but a basic tour. In retrospect I would have got almost as much out of it by wandering unguided.No photographs allowed inside the buildings but allowed in the gardens which are small. Now do not miss the large plant pots filled with water and tiny goldfish and a few with lotus plants (in bloom) when we visited.The design is a teak wood shell to columns made of 'tende' which is apparently a very durable and longlasting hardwood that forms the structure being constructed in a slightly inward angle from the perpendicular. The artefacts on display forming paintings, statues, spiritual guardian statues, and tapestries are few. If you have already seen the inside of a temple in Thailand then do not go. I have yet to go to Vimanmek Palace and that I am sure will outclass this attraction. The guide's accent was average and whilst could be understood you had to concentrate hard to get the information. The guides talk was interrupted by the tremendous noise of adjoining water taxis every few minutes which blotted the tranquillity of the attraction and hence the experience.Particularly if you are from north america you are naturally inquisitive of Jim Thompson's life but i doubt you will be better acquainted with the details when you leave and I think this attraction misses the point. J T commercialised and exported the natural silk trade but there is very little in this museum about this process. You have to take shoes off when inside the building on tour so wear socks for this experience. You are give a locker and key to put bags inside also for the tour so make sure you do not take valuables that will not fit in your pocket.On the positive, the attraction is easily accessible in the city centre and the pier for the water taxi route running between Mahakan fort to the west and an indeterminate point east stops immediatelly outside, hence the noise.My question for you is, how much time have you got sightseeing in Bangkok. If there are other major attractions you have not seen, choose them rather than this one.Open apparently between 9- 5pm every day (www.jimthompsonhouse.com). This attraction is not for wheelchair users and there are plenty of steps and room seals at ground level so it would be unsuitable for the walking impaired. Remember it is a teak building and lacquered so very dark and a challenge for photographer even outside in parts. No aircond understandably but some fans which you should position yourself next to when the guide stops to give the talk.Regards.Chris & Ashley (son) (Anna did not come)"

Unfortunately because of the number of tours being pushed through, we felt a little rushed. The shop has some lovely items for sale, but the prices are very high."

            "review": "Beautiful break from the malls and traffic of Bangkok!. June is hot and humid in Bangkok and the Jim Thompson House is a fabulous piece of calm in a bustling city. Take the Skytrain to National Stadium stop and follow the signs. The Jim Thompson House is at the end of the little street. Admission is 100 baht. The tour is approximately 30 minutes; not all of the guides speak perfect English and you will or can feel a little rushed through the house but you can return to the gardens at your own leisure. There are free lockers for your bags and you will remove your shoes when you enter the house proper. Inside the house you will see Buddhist artefacts, lovely paintings on cotton of the Buddha's previous lives and much porcelain as well as some Chinese furniture. Be sure to get a good luck at the 'mouse' game - a labyrinth game to entertain children which had one time held a real mouse. The trip contains some stairs so it would not be good for someone with mobility issues. There are two individuals doing demonstrations of silk weaving. There is a small shop to purchase books and reproduction prints (100 baht - they are small) and postcards, etc. There is also another shop with silk scarves, ties, place mats, purses, etc. 2600 BTH (roughly $85 CDN) for a beautiful scarf. The patterns are endless. Cotton scarves are half that. Yes, they are cheaper at the markets! But I didn't find any with the amazing patterns at the Jim Thompson House. There is also a bar and restaurant. The food is utterly picturesque - and delicious. They allow you to linger all you want. The fruit smoothies are refreshing as is the iced tea. Thai and Western dishes are quite good and a nice break before heading back into the heat and crowds!"

Upon paying, you will be assigned a group tour, which is the only way you can get in (you can't walk around on your own). Basically, it's a beautiful old home with regional antiques.

I really think this is a place that can be worth seeing even if you are not interested in Jim and his Vogue-model girlfriend. The guide also talked about his connections to the fashion industry. Speaking of the tour guide I think her English was easy to understand and she told us little stories that might not be in wikipedia. I also think that the garden is lovely around the houses. I did not shop here which I also have to admit because I researched it and there is an outlet in Bangkok for Jim Thompson products."

As soon as you walk through the gates, you'll notice what a pretty setting it is, great for photos. The tour of the houses was interesting, full of beautiful antique furniture & homewares. The tour costs 100 BHT (3.10 AUS$), you are provided with a locker in which to place anything you don't wish to carry with you throughout the tour, you cannot wear shoes inside the houses (they also provide a spot for you to leave your shoes), you are not permitted to take photos inside the houses but, can click away to your hearts content in the grounds. There are many tour guides who caters for every nationality. There is a restaurant if you get thirsty or peckish. Don't for get to buy some silk in the gift shop, We bought a coin purse for 390 BHT (12.09 AUS$) & I picked up a silk napkin I intend to have framed for 520 BHT (16.12 AUS$). A touch of the silk trade history in a lovely, refreshing setting."

Although I didn't get to see all of the interior (arriving just as it was closing after a 5-hour tour of Wat Pho, What Phra Kaeo, and several hundred photos), it was like an oasis from the heat and crowds. Traditional Thai houses from long ago, build by the entrepreneur Thai silk businessman from the U.S., it's definitely a place I'd return to. Not to miss - either a drink or a meal at the restaurant. The mango lime smoothie helps rejuvenate after an afternoon of 95 degree heat and high humidity!"

To say that the home of Jim Thompson, an American citizen formerly employed by the Office of Strategic Security (now CIA) during the Second World War, is unremarkable would be rather fatuous. Almost everything about this figure is intriguing, from the fact that his 'house' is constructed from six different authentic Thai houses dismantled and brought from Ayuttaya and BangKrai to be reassembled in the current location, to the man's mysterious disappearance in the Cameron Highlands in 1967.Couple this with the legendary quality silk products, also on sale here in the gift shop, and not forgetting the cafe and restaurant, and this becomes an ideal place to visit and while away some time.I have been here several times with visitors and always recommend it. Unlike a growing number of tourist traps in Bangkok, Jim Thompson's House does not charge exorbitant entrance fees, and provides interesting and entertaining guided tours. Of course, if art and architecture, mixed with a bit of intrigue, doesn't interest you, you're not in the right place!"

Afterwards we had a pleasant, cool drink in the cafe next to the pond with the very large gold fish in it. There are very clean rest rooms. We were also lucky enough to see a man spinning the silk thread from the cocoons. We would really recommend this tour to anyone interested in seeing a beautiful Thai home with lots of history.

The tour itself is very cheap and only takes about 45 minutes but seems to fly by. The tours are timed so we had to wait 20 minutes. We visited the JT Store while we waited. I noticed they did not sell any postcards or a book with photos of the house which seemed odd since photos of the interior of the house are not allowed. I picked out some items to purchase and then had the store hold them while we went on our tour. Our guide was excellent and very bubbly. We put our purses and any bags in little wooden lockers. During the tour it is hard to tell where one building ended and another one began. Mr. Thompson was a very talented designer and had exquisite taste. I did snap a couple photos even being trailed by a young man who did not report me! The simplicity and elegance of the house was surprising. Following the tour I went back to the store and made my purchases. I bought some pillow covers, 2 scarves and little silk boxes that snap together. I had visited the Jim Thompson store in Singapore a few days before and thought they had a better selection of some items. However, the main store where the house is certainly was larger and had tons of items. Lastly, we had lunch which was good and reasonably priced. The restaurant is open but it was not hot inside and was very pleasant. To leave the JT House you can take their transportation to the Skytrain, a taxi or a tuk tuk. I had been advised not to take a tuk tuk in Bangkok but he was parked right in front and the men working at the building said it was fine and safe. Our hotel was very close and near the Siam Paragon. The tuk tuk was fun and it only took about 7 minutes to get back to our hotel."

Although very difficult to find on your own as few people in the area spoke English and they kept pointing us to the Jim Thompson stores, we eventually made our way there. The tour was our fist showing silk production so we found it very interesting. His home was quite beautiful and the stories of his life led me to do further research on the man."

You must have a tour guide with you which was cheap. Our guide however had a thick accent and was hard to understand at times. But it was enough to get the gist. The tour was fast too, so it's perfect if you just want to glide to the next attraction. It's just nice to see the Jim Thompson brand around the world and be able to say you've been to his house. Plus, our toddler loved playing in the courtyard and watching the fish in the pond."

In fact we wished we\u2019d allowed some extra time just to walk the grounds and take it all in after our official tour was over.We learned little about how the silk trade worked but a lot about the amazing Jim Thompson who, single handed, created the industry that exists today. We enjoyed walking through this huge visual aid as our guide told the story and answered our questions with ease.An unexpected bonus was the insights into Buddhism, the dominant religion of Thailand, that sprang from the context of the tour. It was a particular relief to be assured that spirits can only travel in straight lines. And interesting that those who find a gecko lizard in their home believe it is one of their ancestors. The Jim Thompson House is easy to reach on the BTS and is easy to combine with a visit to the massive MBK shopping centre that is almost next door."

The tour is very cheap (100 baht or so), and the tour guides are great. The house itself is simply lovely, and it's a great way to spend an hour in Bangkok. The tour went by very quickly. Young children might be bored, but older children (and adults) would probably like this. The art and other pieces in the house are original and beautifully presented. It's like visiting a museum, but somehow much more fun seeing the pieces in a house."

That is no small feat, considering you come from one of the busiest shopping areas in Bangkok. But the beautiful layout of the house with it's added restaurant and silk shop is secluded and peaceful. The tour of the house costs admission, but is well worth it, to see some of the incredible antiques collected. The house itself is a merging of four wood houses transported from other regions and it is amazing with which architectural feeling Thompson created one house from them. The garden, which you can visit before or after the guided tour of the house features interesting silk related exhibits, such as live worms and cocoons, a loom and also a demonstration of silk thread collection."

I've been here twice most recently in 3/2013.It's a bit tricky to find but worth the walk.The restaurant though is nice is 100% for tourists and more authentic and better priced food can be had elsewhere.... The story of Thompson and the quality of products he inspired is indeed a nice thing to see.The museum is interesting to see....Overall maybe worth 2-3 hours max.Be sure to watch the thai dancing if you're lucky enough to be there then as it's very up front and close which is nice to experience."

Frankly, we were disappointed. Yes, the houses are traditional Thai. yes, they are filled with artefacts. Yes, it is nicely maintained. yes, you get a guided tour of 30 odd minutes. But is worth the time and effort? Is it unique? Is it unusual? In my opinion, NO.So I wouldn't go there again. What I mean by that is while I would go to Wat Arun or Wat Pho or the Grand Palace again, there is nothing in the Jim Thompson house that will me attract me again.We were also disappointed by the merchandise in the shop. It was nothing but a shop that you can find anywhere - there was no exclusivity of the merchandise either in terms of design, styles or even origin - items were not exclusively of silk or Thai . We saw made in India, China labels.Sadly, to us, even the quality could have been better. Sorry - but we had seen some really lovely silk stuff at Artisan's de Angkor in Siem Reap 3 days ago and this was nothing in comparison. So in my book - there is nothing special here.P.S. We asked to spend more time in the houses to get a closer look at the artefacts but were told that it could only be done with a guide - and guide were in short supply. So we simply left."

While very clean, and filled with beautiful Thai art, it is basically a series of traditional Thai houses that Mr. Thompson combined to make a more western type dwelling. His story is interesting enough, and it is probably worth the price of admission, which is pretty cheap, but only if you're in the neighbourhood (an easy walk from MBK mall), or if you have an interest in the history of Thai silk. The store does have beautiful pieces, and is nicely air-conditioned, which is great, because there is not much air circulation on the grounds. One thing that I must compliment this place on is the availability of multilingual tours, at no additional charge. Nice to see that they have made the effort to accommodate as many people as possible. Also, the place is spotless, including the public bathrooms. There is also a nice restaurant on the grounds. We didn't try it, but the menu looked interesting."

He didn't have to tread the minefield of proliferated fakes that now dominate Bangkok's antique market.

This is now a museum which is well worth a visit if you have a spare couple of hours in Bangkok. The museum has some nice gardens and there are regular tours in a variety of languages (you are not allowed to tour the house independantly as the exhibits are valuable). We were lucky to visit on Jim Thompson's birthday (he disappeared in Malaysia in the 1960s) and the staff had put an amazing fruit and vegatable display in the grounds in his honour). If you do want to visit to the Skytrain to the National Stadium and the signposts in the station will tell you which exit to take. The house is about 600 yards from the station and be sure to ignore the people on the end of the Soi who tell you the house is closed but they can take you shopping. The house should not be confused with Jim Thompson silk shops as, if you catch a taxi or a tuk-tuk, you are likely to be whisked away to the shop, where the taxi driver may get commission, rather than the house."

Something must be done to stop them from escaping the pans!!!"

The American Jim Thompson fell in love with Thailand when sent there in WW11 & returned after leaving the army. He revived the Thai silk industry which is still prosperous today. He disappeared on a trip to Malaysia in 1967, which gives it another kudos. The silk products available in the shop are beautiful, but very expensive."

As we were leaving the JT House we saw there were motorized carts available to take people to the corner where the train station was located.

If you find yourself on the same side as the national stadium you're on the wrong side. Don't worry though, there's a footbridge that takes you across the busy road to the otherside. If you exit on the left - national stadium side of the road - be aware that the sign pointing you in the direction of Jim Thompson's House, is misleading and if you follow it you'll end up walking past its location and it will take some time to figure out where it is. The key thing to remember is that it is really not far from the station and is in a road that is almost directly opposite the stadium. It's not sign-posted that well, but if you can spot Soi Kasem Sai 1 you should be able to find Soi Kasem Sai 2 very easily and both streets are just outside the Skytrain exits. If you've been walking for some time you've overshot it.As for the museum itself, it's a definite MUST for any westerner visiting Bangkok. You honestly have never seen such a beautiful home before and you are unlikely to see one like it again. His vast art collection alone is enough to make you drool but the buildings and the garden setting will make you positively green with envy. Honestly, how is it possible for anyone to live in such an enchanted place - it is like stepping into some sort of Asian fairy tale! As you walk in you know you have arrived somewhere very special and in the hurly burly chaos of Bangkok, Jim Thompson's Home is a lush paradise which you are more than happy to lose yourself in. I was there in January and it was busy. But no matter how full it seemed, the feeling of tranquillity and calm that settles over you as you enter the property is something to experience. The tours are conducted in French and English (and possibly other languages too) and there's a cafe and souvenir shop where you can happily stock up on gifts either whilst you're waiting for your tour to begin or once you're done (be careful, you will find it hard to part with these some of these gifts once you return home). You're not allowed to take photos once you're inside the main house but can take them from the outside - you have to choose your moment carefully and be quick as there are constant tours in progress - however there are some exquisit books that have pictures of every nook and cranny of the property and they are well worth buying. The story of his life and disappearance is also fascinating and makes for great aeroplane reading. When I was there they had two young people demonstrating how silk is boiled and 'unravelled' from the cocoons and turned into silk thread, as well as how it is then woven - both picturesque as well as informative. My guide was fluent in telling the story of Jim Thompson's house, but questions wern't fully answered - whether this was due to lack of knowledge or lack of understanding is unclear. Which is another reason why the books are useful as they tend to answer most, if not all, of the questions you are likely to have.All in all it is definitely a tourist destination you should make time to visit."

However, they do provide that in several languages and it didn't seem that anyone's waiting time was very long. When you buy the ticket (that is relatively expensive) they cannot tell you when the next tour in your language will be, so make sure you have the time to sit and wait for a little while. The tour is interesting as is the house. But if you don't enjoy historical houses, obviously, don't bother! Oh, and of course, as you're in Thailand, be prepared to take your shoes off when entering the house! I think it is a shame they didn't go deeper into the architectual aspect of the house and how it compares to 'regular' Thai houses of that time (of which I know nothing!).

This is a beautiful house with a really beautiful garden. The tour was really good. I'm the kind of person who normally skips the tour and wanders around by myself, but the house is only accessible by tour group so I went along. It was actually pretty interesting and the tour leader did a great job. There was lots of beautiful details in the house and some really beautiful artwork to enjoy. I was pleasantly surprised and took some very pretty pictures in the garden. You are not allowed to take pictures in the house and you also have to lock your bag in a locker before going inside. It seemed pretty safe, though, so I don't think there is anything to worry about. There was an attendant there and you are able to lock the locker and take the key with you. You also have to take your shoes off before you go in the house, so you might want to wear socks if you don't like being barefoot in a strange place. All in all this is a nice way to spend an afternoon."

The house and garden are nice enough, but what I liked best was the silk spinning demonstration, which makes you appreciate just how special silk is!The entry fee includes a compulsorary tour, it's fairly interesting, not very long, and (the English language version) seems to run often.There's a shop on-site, it's very expensive compared to nearby MBK (which has a great selection of skirts and scarves labled as silk which really feel like silk) but that's what you pay to be sure of what you're getting!There's also a cafe on-site, it's okay but nothing special.It's less than 5 mins walk from National Stadium BTS station (which adjoins MBK) but there's a free golf cart transfer if you don't care to walk."

The great thing is... the price ticket hasn't change!! still 100 bath (This is great since the other places I went this time has rise their price) and there's a golf car that can drive you to the end of the street now. the place is as lovely as before. My mum said she feel like she's in countryside and think of changing my grands' house garden into something like JT house. The house is in great condition despite the age. There are some furniture change but the guide explain that it was always not the original furniture that belong when JT still live there. The artifacts are well maintain, the wood are still very strong. If you can't go to Ayutthaya where JT bought most of his house (he turn 6 houses into 1 connected house), then this place is a must visit. I didn't go to the shop though cos I remember it was very expensive for me."

Instead it is a waste of time to get there and to ogle with the hordes.Tours begin every 5 minutes with tourists sorted by language. The problem with that is because there are at least 4 or 5 tours in addition to yours, it is difficult to get pictures of anything other than mobs of tourists blocking the view of the house. Pictures are not allowed in the second (and most interesting) floor but all you would capture are mobs of tourists. Pictures are not allowed in the sale area, not even of the brief sign explaining Thompson's efforts to revive the silk industry (For retribution you can sit on a outside bench and quite well telephoto the inside of the sale area.). There are many more worthwhile ways to spend your time; give Jim Thompson's 100 Bhat to the driver who takes you there."

For your 400 THB entrance fee you get a tour of the house and a short introduction to the life of Jim Thompson. The tour isn't too long that you get bored but contains just enough information to make it interesting. There is also a nice restaurant located near the entrance which you can visit without going into the house itself.There is a gift shop at the entrance to the house, again you don't need to pay the 400 THB if you just want to visit the shop/restaurant. There are plenty of other \"Jim Thompson\" silk stops all over Bangkok and a few in the duty free area of the international airport too, so you don't really need to come here just for the shop.Getting there is easy, either take a taxi, the BTS to National Stadium or you could try a Khlong bus boat to Hua Chang Pier on the Golden Mount line. For the Khlong boats check out http://www.transitbangkok.com/khlong_boats.htmlYou can't take photos inside the house and free lockers are provided to store your bags in during the tour. Shoes must be taken off and stored on shelves. Tip: hold your nose as you deposit/collect your shoes!!!!."

You might even find a little tuk-tuk style golf-cart ferrying visitors back and forth for free. The tour of the house is good--only about 40 minutes long--and very informative. The silk in the gift shop is crazy expensive though, I mean even higher than what you would pay in the west. You can't take pictures inside the house which is too bad--you'll want to--but they have some nice entertainment out front that you can take shots of. This would be a great place to come with family or just on your own. I don't think you need to book a tour to get there, though people will try to convince you otherwise. It really is cheap and easy to get to on your own. Oh, and while the shop is expensive, the tour is only 100 baht per person, roughly $3."

In the courtyard, some staff demonstrate how silk is made, and some of the females take a break every once in awhile and do some traditional Thai dancing. There's a restaurant that's not bad for the price, and two gift shops. On is an overpriced shop full of Jim Thompson products. Be sure to check the materials of what you buy because not everything is silk - lots of cotton and manmade fibers, but with the prices, you'd think you were buying silk. The smaller gift shop has a decent selection of cards, postcards, books, and so on and reasonable (for a museum shop) prices."

There's a 45 minute tour guided tour of the house and its grounds. You have to take the guided tour which makes perfect sense to me. I'm sure the foundation doesn't want items damaged or stolen. The guide I toured with was good. The information was humorously imparted in an interactive manner. I thought the entry fee (100 baht) was a little expensive. The silk products in the store were way too expensive, but the restaurant was reasonably priced for western food and the food was good. It's a few blocks fromt the subway, but you can get a free ride if you want it. I don't think it's necessary, but it is nice. I recommend it around day 3, or whenever you get 'temple-ed' or 'Bhudda-ed out.'"

I loved watching a man spinning silk from a boiling cauldron of silk cocoons. Hypnotizing. I had no idea this is how one gets silk from the cocoon.Treat the shop as part of the museum.

Another great tour to do when in Bangkok is a visit to Jim Thompson House and Museum.We had an English speaking guide who explained how Jim Thompson, an American Military Officer came to Thailand and fell in love with the country and its people. Soon after WW2 he decided to live there and went back to Bangkok. Thompson was very interested in the long neglected craft of hand weaving of silk and he was convinced of the exceptional quality of this sort of fabric. So he started to rebuild the whole industry and made it to worldwide success with his Thai Silk Company. In 1967 he went for holidays to the Cameron Highlands of Malaya where he never turned back from a walk into the jungle.His house in Bangkok didn\u2019t change much since the day he disappeared. Our guide showed us around and gave us, a brief talk about the architecture of the six teak wood buildings that came from all over the country and were reconstructed here in Bangkok. The design is an interesting combination of Thai Style with European influence.Outside the buildings there were examples of silk caterpillars, how to make the raw product and how to spin the threads.Attached to the museum you will find The Jim Thompson Art Centre with changing exhibitions that is also worth to have a look at (admission is free).If you are hungry, there is a wide choice of food & beverages at Thompson Bar & Restaurant.Overall, a definitely worthwhile tour as the Jim Thompson Foundation is also committed to the preservation of Thailand artistic & cultural heritage.Info: Opening hours are daily from 9 am to 5 pm with hourly guided tours, admission fee is 100 Baht per adult, you can get there by Sky Train, taxi, Tuk tuk or Klong Boat, however have a look on a map before, than it\u2019s easier to find."

Lunch was yummy - we stuck with the Thai options and couldn't fault them.Great way to catch your breath in the city that never sleeps."

            "review": "A beautiful little oasis in the big city. I was expecting the Jim Thompson House to be crowded with and hawkers and tuk-tuk drivers telling me it's closed. As with other Bangkok attractions, the city seems to have been cracking down on scammers with signs that clearly say it's open every day. It's located on a quiet little soi (side street) not far from the National Stadium skytrain stop. There is even a free golf-cart / clean, large tuk-tuk shuttle service from the main street to the house, though I didn't use it. Tours are available in English and French and total admission was 100 baht at the time ( about US $3). I am not a big art fan, but the house and grounds have lots of beautiful Thai art pieces collected by Mr. Thompson over his life, lots of ponds and urns with fish, frogs, and turtles, and jungle-esque vegetation. The house itself is gorgeous and was built in a traditional Thai style. It may be hard to find other examples of this kind of architecture in Bangkok, so if you want to see some old-style Thai houses but won't get a chance to go the countryside on your Thailand trip, then this is the place to go. It is next to a narrow canal, which used to be the main entrance of the house, but the fence is high and there is no danger of falling in. The only way to the second floor is by stairs, so if you have trouble walking you may have to skip that part of the tour. As with many Asian houses, you must remove your shoes before you enter the house, but the floors are quite clean. Tours are well-organized and guides knowledgeable, and this is not an overcrowded, harried, noisy place like the Grand Palace. There is, of course, a Jim Thompson silk store on the grounds if you want to buy some silk, a cafe, a small art gallery with free art/photo exhibits (at the time), and some traditionally dressed silk weavers / dancers demonstrating their skills."

They focus mostly on the house disposition and decoration and they barely reveal any details on Jim Thompson's life or the role of silk in Thailand's economy. I was hoping to learn more about this. They provide free shuttle from the metro station. It is only around 300/400 metres but with the heat is appreciated. They also have a store and certainly the marketing around JT is overwhelming and in my opinion a bit exaggerated. I had the feeling they had more merch than the Tate or the Louvre."

It is so pleasant walking in the shade of the trees, with a number of pools of water no doubt helping to keep the temperature down, and admiring the traditional Thai architecture and various historic items scattered about the place. The tour is short, but is done in other languages too, for example the one before ours was in French, so we had a 20 minute wait before our tour started but we used the time to look around the shop and visit the bathroom. The tour was very informative and the collection of items is small but very varied, from old Buddha statues to old pictures, to items used by Jim Thompson himself, such as a large block used for printing onto silk. He combined European and Asian elements in the houses; of particular note was the Italian marble which was so to walk on when the temperature outside was so high - shoes cannot be worn in the buildings in the collection. After we finished the tour we visited the shop which has a good collection of items for purchase, though admittedly pretty much the same as is available at the airport. Then we had a lunch at the restaurant, of which the highlight was the dish served in a carved-out pineapple. Fun to get served and very tasty too. When we left there were two golf buggies running a shuttle between the entrance and the end of the laneway near the stadium, with no shortage of choice for transport to the next destination. We're both happy we took one afternoon out of our stay to visit this attraction."

If you have to wait you can go back out to the shop which we did - lots of lovely silk scarves and shirts, purses, and housewares - not cheap but beautifully made. Our guide did a fantastic job of going over Jim Thompson's story and various points of interest in the different parts of the house. A lot of thought went into creating this home. We had to take off our shoes to enter the house. Afterward we could wander around on our own and take photos (except for the interior of the house, and no photos allowed there). We then decided to have lunch at the restaurant on site and it was absolutely lovely as we got a table by the pond and the food was delicious, in particular the green curry.

Due to the riots in Bangkok at the time, it was one of the few places we could go although I had friends who were there a month later and they couldn't even go here! Knowing nothing about Jim Thompson, I found the tour very interesting and his disappearance intriguing, although I'm pretty sure he just wandered off into the jungle, fell down and died somewhere. The house has been kept just as it was when Mr Thompson lived there and his collection of artifacts were fascinating. I enjoyed the gardens. We finished our visit in the gift shop where I spent a happy hour browsing before making my purchases. The cost of the tour and the prices in the gift shop were reasonable I thought. My husband also enjoyed the tour although he found the humidity in the gardens pretty unbearable. (The gift shop is air conditioned!!) I would recommend this as an interesting break from the temples and crowds in Bangkok and somewhere to spend an hour or two. Removing shoes and leaving bags behind (securely) is just one of those things one has to do as a tourist and I respect the hosts' rights to request this and did not object."

And it awaits with a mysterious story about the disappeared owner. You may only enter with a guide but it is interesting. Several languages provided. There is also a shop selling Jim Thompson silk products and a restaurant."

Pros:- it was very easy to get to -just a few hundred meters on foot from BTS National Stadium and down a narrow side street- very orderly and frequent individual tours with guides catering to a number of languages- cheap tour (299baht p.p) lasting 35mins- beautiful grounds including onsite restaurant with various fish ponds full of coy, goldfish and even some rather large turtles!Cons:- our guide, while she could speak English, didn't speak it very well so made it extremely difficult to understand what she was telling us- I think the tour could've been done in half the time- the house is very small and full of antique ornaments and furniture hence their need to split out into small groups and take everyone around in an orderly fashion. Personally I would've preferred making my own way around and reading about the history via plaques etc placed around the house - just like they do Japan. That's just my personal preference - we decided to eat at the onsite restaurant as our tour ended just after midday and we were keen to get the kids back for a nap. Yes it's convenient but be prepared to pay for it (1700 baht) for 2 entrees, 1 risk dish, 1 (tiny) noodle dish and 3 drinks. Food was ok (yes, just 'ok') but the mango smoothie I ordeed was completely bland."

I was also annoyed that the staff made a fuss about carrying even small bum-bags into the bulding. If you're interested in the silk industry and want to pay inflated prices for the (very nice) branded products, then maybe it's worth it.

Service was so-so, they seemed to be very busy and the food came separately rather than at the same time!Cons:- Be prepared to walk bare foot, as it is custom in Thai houses. So if you have sweaty feet, this is a warning!- Not really a con, but the tour talks a lot about Jim Thompson and everything related to him, but I didnt really learn much about SILK itself. I think this place would benefit a lot if they created a new section to educate tourists more on how silk is made, etc.- we had to place our bags into a locker, but it is completely safe so thats not a problem."

The gardens are beautiful and he also had a beautiful collection of artifacts which collected from all over the place. His own story is fascinating, if somewhat mysterious. Even though this place gets very busy, they run the tours smoothly so as to get everyone through efficiently. I recommend going early and beating the crowds. We did the 9.30am tour and by the time we finished there were so many people coming, but it was xmas day so perhaps it had something to do with that!The restaurant/cafe is beautiful and serves refreshing and delicious food and drinks. Upstairs is a space which I assume you can book for special occasions as I saw a Thai wedding happening in there.The souvenir store is great. I'm not a fan of cheap token souvenirs, but they have high quality and beautifully designed products which are a legacy of Jim Thompson and when we were there, there was also a gentleman demonstrating the process of working the silk from the silkworm cocoons."

Carefully preserved by a foundation, the house offers extraordinary sculpture, fascinating architecture and a remarkable story. Did the tour 6 years ago and the second time did not dissapoint. Have lunch at the JT restaurant on site. Excellent food in a sophisticated surrounding. Note: you may have to wait up to 40 minutes for your tour guide (groups are limited to 15 and assembled on the basis of tour guide language).Suprisingly, many taxi drivers don't know about this museum or its location. Direct them to the National Stadium, a couple of blocks from the Jim Thompson house (and serviced by a golf cart by JT staff)"

By that I mean there were few if any personal possessions of the late jim Thompson and what we were told by the guide is printed verabtim in the handout at recception. my advice: don't pay for the tour. just get a leaflet, walk into the courtyard, take some pictures then leave...

The house that Jim built before he disappeared in mysterious circumstances has turned into a tourist attraction of its own.THe house is located 200 meters from the sky train station National Stadium and is also on one of the few remaining klongs (Canals) of Bangkok. The house was completed in the late 50's and is adorned with relics and antiques that Mr Thompsom collected over the years.Very little effort is required to walk around the house and if you are interested in antiques the house and garden are well worth a couple of hours. You don't have to take the guided tour. However, if you want to venture inside the house you will need to. The cost of the tour is 100baht. Well worth it in my opinion.There is also a restaurant and cafe on the premises although I did not eat here.A tip - if you wait at at the beginning of the street (Kasem San Soi 2) special Jim Thompson golf buggys will pick you up free of charge and take you the 200 meters to the house."

To be frank I wanted to visit the Jim Thompson house on one of my visits to Thailand as I had been reading the book about his disappearance only a few months before. Both aware of his legacy in Thailand my fianc\u00e9 and myself both enjoyed this little trip in his house in the Siam area. The tour is always guided mainly because of the artifacts still original in the house are collectables and old, probably would be invaluable to them. The pictures can only be taken from outside the house which is one of their policies. Shoes to be left outside. The tours are done in various languages but yes as commented before this short tour is not very detailed and the knowledge given by the guides is very short at times so people who do not know about J.Thompson will probably not enjoy the visit. There is also a Jim Thompson shop on site, a cafe and a restaurant."

The houses were beautiful (teak wood) and the grounds were gorgeous, especially for being right in the midst of Bangkok. Tours in English, French, Japanese and Thai left about every 15-20 minutes. There was also a really unique special exhibit (included in admission) about globalization, natural disasters, etc. on the second floor...definitely visit it!

Just get the sky train to the national stadium and it is within walking distance from there. Our first impressions were great, a wonderful hidden retreat setting, surrounded by traditional thai buildings and a leafy green backdrop. Restaurant, workshops and the obligatory gift shop somewhat over shadowed the actual reason we went. The tours are very well organised and clearly well planned, in various languages. Maybe we just got a new girl or someone who is relatively timid or shy, because I could barely understand or hear a word she said on the entire tour. We walked from room to room in the uniquely constructed thai house and around the gardens, as I strained to hear just exactly what it was all about. I didn't want to upset the tour guide by constantly asking: \"could you repeat that again please?\" or \"I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that?\" So by the end I was simply bored and confused. To be honest I know the gist of the story, but can't really fathom why this has become a tourist attraction, intriguing story or not. I reckon I would've had more fun queuing for Thailand V Malaysia tickets at the National Stadium!"

I was floored by the beauty of the architecture and the interiors. Our guide spoke very good English and was highly engaging. You were free to wander the grounds after the tour (but you could not go back inside the main house or take any photos inside). There was something beautiful in every corner you looked, both within the house and in the lush gardens.This is a very worthwhile trip. For anyone who is worried this experience isn't somehow \"authentic,' well, you may be right.

Excellent in-house guides and a cafe to rest your weary feet before you descend on the other mecca - Paragon shopping mall. Good access by Skytrain."

You have to make sure that you are correctly dressed to enter this site, check out the advice on dress codes for tourist sites and temples in Bangkok, it is quite confusing as it sometimes appear there are different rules for different people but if you do your best you will get there. The house was magnificent and we were in time for a tour in English which was free of charge, well worth a visit if you are interested in Thai history and architecture and culture. There is lots to see at the site and you can fill a morning or more here. It is out of the way of the main attractions so you will need to get a taxi, it is easy to get a taxi back if you go outside of the gates there are usually some waiting."

There is a shuttle service that takes you from the top of the road to the house, but it only takes about 5 minutes to walk it.You are greeted by a member of staff, and are taken to the front desk, where you are given a ticket and time, uusually within 30 minutes or so. At the appointed time, you are then given a tour of the house.It is quite unusual, in that Jim Thompson, being an Amercan, who fell in love with Thailand, has bough in quite a few modern conveniences to a very traditional setting. The guide will point out these points to you. For example, it has a a modern WC. It also has a table setting for guests, whoch tradional homes don't. They eat on the floor, or a very low table.The collection of art work and silks are beautiful, and if you take the time to go to the shop, and browse the book about the house, you will see that his mysterious dissaperance in the jungle, only adds to the mystique and charm of the house.Worth a visit, just to get a idea of how much influence he had on the silk trade.Also has a lovely cafe in pretty surroundings."

Jim Thompson (of Thai-silk fame) created his home by combining a number of traditional teak Thai houses into a grand residence alongside one of Bangkok's canals, in which he showcased his collection of Thai cultural antiques. It is necessary to take a guided tour which lasts approx 30 mins, with different languages rotated throughout the day. The guide on my tour was reasonably fluent, and certainly charming. The house includes tropical gardens which provide some relief from the humidity, and there is a restaurant, but not a less formal cafe, as well as a Jim Thompson retail outlet. The house is easily accessible (walking distance) from National Stadium skyrail station - take the exit closest to the end of the line and which gives access to the footpath over the road from the stadium. Visiting this attraction is a worthwhile thing to do in a visit to Bangkok as it provides insight into how the wealthy lived during a bygone era, and also for the quality of the artifacts on show."

The antiques are wonderful, and the site itself is an oasis in Bangkok's urban jungle. The difference between this most recent visit and my first one 10 years ago? It's a lot more commercial. But that's to be expected. We had lunch at the restaurant and the food was really top-notch. While the tour is just 30 minutes, we ended up spending a couple of hours here. I highly recommend the Jim Thompson house to any visitor to Bangkok who is interested in the Bangkok of old."

I did the Grand Palace and all the big Wats once, years ago, and have never felt the need to go back, but I go to the Jim Thompson house again, and again! I love the peace and serenity of the garden, even though the house is now surrounded by high rises, you still get a sense of what it was like to live in Bangkok 60 plus years ago. I'm also absolutely in love with the house itself- this is what I want to build when I'm ready to retire somewhere warm and tropical!!The guided tour is well done (usually let by Thai students, for whom this is an \"after school\" type job and a chance to practice their English, but they clearly receive thorough training). and takes about half an hour. Jim Thompson accumulated some really wonderful and unique art, and it is a pleasure to see it up close and in a house (rather than stuffy museum) setting. After the tour you are free to wander the grounds at your leisure and contemplate the life and mystery of the man who helped build the Thai economy and then disappeared without a trace so long ago. there are some nice spots to sit and relax tucked away from the rest of the tourists, and the restaurant is nice (if relatively pricey). I always end up spending WAY too much money in the gift shop, but they do give you directions to the Jim Thompson outlet if you are so inclined."

You need to take the scheduled tour around the house which takes about half and hour per session. The house is nice with wonderful antiques collected by Jim Thompson throughout his travels. I find this place quite average though, there's not much history associated to it apart from the antiques. The only thing good is the quality silk they sell at the gift shop but even then, Jim Thompson shop is available at most shopping complexes in Bangkok including Siam Paragon and Don Mueng International Airport. Go only if you have time to kill."

I must admit I had never heard of JT or his silk, but I gather it is pretty big brand in Thailand."

I passed this by on previous trips to Bangkok, thinking it was too \"touristy\", but when I mentioned to a local colleague my interest in Thai teak houses he told me I must go see Jim Thompson's house. He was spot on. I was enthralled by the history of the house and of teak houses in general, by his collection of antiques, and by his personal story. The tour is only 30 mins but then you can look around the grounds and lovely garden on your own. Yes, it's a tourist destination with a gift shop and restaurant, but it's nicely done and frankly charming. Not everyone will enjoy this attraction, but if you're interested in architecture or antiques I think you'll like it. The fee is only 100 baht. I recommend getting there early to beat the heat and the crowds. Afterwards you can enjoy a cold beer or smoothie by the koi pond and soak up the ambiance."

It does help to go early, as you are only allowed via a tour and they schedule them by language. Or, send someone for the tickets and then come back later. Otherwise you'll be waiting at the store or cafe, which the latter seemed a bit expensive. Also, don't bring too many bags and such since you'll have to leave them in lockers along with your shoes."

The gardens are beautiful and the shop was full of really well made Thai silk items. I also had no idea about the branding the company has done with its Silk wears.

But the cynic in me is not convinced that Jim Thompson wasn't just an American that got lucky with the silk and wanted to create a Western Style house, which meant he had to buy a few Thai houses and group them. If he had been British or had not disappeared in unusual circumstances, I am not sure this place would be as popular. For me it is only a 3, but I think Americans and my son love the place, so I have rated it 4 out of 5."

We came back in the evening to enjoy the full menu and reasonably priced good wines ( for Bangkok that is)... The restaurant is open during the day but the evening menu and setting is just superb and they are open till 23:00... We sat out next to the pond with all the Koi Carp .. So good we came back twice... If your feeling adventurous after busting the house daytime ..on coming out turn left towards the canal then turn right and follow the pathway up next to the canal , you'll see all the boats passing you taking people home.. There's a drop off point for the boats just before the road bridge and just after this you'll find a little make shift bar selling beers and soft Drinks where the locals grab a cold one on the way home .. Have a beer here it's bear right and continue under the road bridge then turn right and you come out on the main road towards MBK and Siam Paragon"

Our English speaking guide did not speak English particularly fluently."

The 100 baht ride or $3 US in the Tuk Tuk delivered us close to (too smelly to pull in) the famous Jim Thompson house which has a great history of a mysterious entrepreneur. Jim Thompson was a World War II veteran who started a silk business in Thailand after the war. Thompson seemed to have a love for the Thai people and the Thai people clearly love him today. After he made his fortune in the silk trade, he built the \u201cJim Thompson House\u201d using his American architectural background and with a Far Eastern influence, he created a unique residential compound that is open to tourists since his unexplained passing. The story that we heard in Thailand is Jim Thompson was out for a walk in the jungle and maybe a tiger ate him since his body was never found. However, since Thompson was ex-CIA (if you\u2019re ever \u201cex\u201d) and he prepared a \u201cpaper\u201d leaving all of his possessions to the Thai people, I get the feeling that he might not have been \u201cex\u201d.  Regardless, it was a beautiful compound with much priceless art, a cafeteria, and of course a gift shop. I was so taken that I went over budget and purchased a Jim Thompson silk tie and pocket square with elephants for 2000 baht = $78 US which was non-negotiable unlike the tailor shops.If you enjoyed the blip you will find more travel detail at the dog\u2019s biog check it out:http://shoethieves.blogspot.com/"

Every time we visit Bangkok we always make the trip to this place, yes sometimes the group tours can be a little overcrowded however just being in the peaceful surrounds of this place is more than enough to escape the bustle of Bangkok and for 100 Baht it really is worth the visit. The cafe serves beautiful food and all the staff are extremely friendly and helpful, yes the gift shop may be a little expensive however it does help the foundation so like any onside gift store prices a always going to be a little higher."

The main interest of the visit is to admire the old Thai houses bought and reinstalled along the canal by Jim Thompson. They're fully furnished with antiques, including some very beautiful Buddha statues. You're compelled to visit with their guides, who are very friendly and educated but will not let you wander too much, except in the small garden. The place has partly built its reputation on Thompson's mysterious disappearance, and the bookshop offers biographies that attempt to solve the mystery. While I'd not describe the house as a priority for people visiting the city, it's still a very nice, atmospheric location. The easiest way to reach it is to ride on the SkyTrain till 'National Stadium'."

The maps make it seem like you can walk from Siam, but unless you want to walk around motorcycle taxi drivers gambling underneath bridges and through people's homes, you are much better off walking a short distance from National Stadium. When you arrive at the Jim Thompson House you'll pay 100 baht and be placed into a group for the compulsory tour. We had about half an hour to kill before our 12:15 tour started and it was extremely hot outside and we were being eaten alive by mosquitoes and pesky flies. The gift shops aren't good time killers unless you want to pay 2,400 baht for a small handkerchief sized silk scarf. You'll have to put any bags in the provided lockers which is a pain (and I saw several people on the tour that didn't actually follow this rule) for the half-hour tour. Our tour guide spoke excellent English, but she didn't tell me anything that I hadn't already read on Wikipedia. The actual tour only shows you a few rooms in his house and you can't take photos inside the house. I had high expectations for the Jim Thompson House but after my visit I know I'd be better off doing my own research by buying a book than relying on this tour."

Very informative tour, many language options, pleseant guides and staff, a small imtimate look into an expats experience in Bangkok. Plan 1 1/2 - 2 hours minimum, and located near the National Station BTS. Worthy of a nice, relaxed break from hectic Bangkok."

However, if your time in Bangkok is limited then the Jim Thompson house is something you might want to omit from your \"to see\" list.

All visits are guided (30-40 minute tours) and you will need to book yourself on one in your language once you arrive there but they are very frequent.

Located 3-5 minutes walk from the National Stadium (Silom line) BTS station it's very easy to get to. The house is actually not that old but the buildings were built with traditional Thai techniques and style. The architecture, art, and gardens are beautiful. I have been twice and both times the guides spoke excellent English and the tour proceeded smoothly but did not feel overly rushed. That's saying a lot for me because I worked in a museum and like to read every label so basically all tours are \"rushed\" for me! There is a wonderful shop with Thompson Thai silk items and books on site but bring your pocketbook, the silk is high quality (I think, I'm not an expert) and prices are not cheap. The profits go to the museum though so it's well spent."

Jim Thompson's life wasn't that spectacular and his property isn't even particular Thai as he merged different styles. The cost is reasonable but the tour didn't hold my imagination at all and would definitely not be something for younger children. I think if you aren't Thai then there are much better things to see that help you understand and love Thai culture; this is a nice collection but for me seems strange to see a house of a successful expat while visiting a country.Jim Thompson's personal story is not interesting at all."

Enjoy the gardens and the extensive collection of art and Buddhist statues. Regular tours in Thai, English and several other languages are available as is a nice gift shop.

I had read much of the intriguing story of the life and mysterious disappearance of Jim Thompson, the man credited with modernizing and internationalizing the Thai silk industry. Due to his OSS/CIA connections, conspiracy theories abound as to what happened to him. That we shall probably never know, His legacy is rich though and we can get a sense of it in the superb Jim Thompson house with its unique architecture and many antiques, a beautiful tropical garden that he loved and of course the company that bears his name, with beautiful silk products. My parents were here on holiday, so we thought we'd check this out. We thoroughly enjoyed it, especially the English tour that gave many insights both interesting and amusing into this remarkable character who chose to make Thailand his home, whilst bringing great benefits to the art of Thai silk making. Our tour guide, a very sweet girl called Ben, spoke good English and was very kind and helpful, helping my Mother (who has knee replacements) over the indoor steps at the entrance to each room.The only downside to an otherwise very interesting experience was in the restaurant, where the staff were both miserable and inefficient. The food itself, though not cheap was very tasty and well presented. It is very unusual in Thailand to encounter such sullen service and it is the only time in any restaurant where I left no tip at all. Despite this, I thoroughly recommend the attraction, you just might want to skip the restaurant and find somewhere you can get food served with the famous Thai smile!"

The shop has some merchandise, but if you are looking to get gifts their stores and outlet stores have more selection."

Just near the National Stadium BTS station. 100 baht entry fee was very reasonable. You have to take a guided tour but this was very informative and available in Thai, English or French and then were starting every 15 mins or so. The house is really amazing and there are so many artifacts to see and most are just out as they would have been there when he lived there. You have to lock your possessions in a free locker but that was no hassle so you can't take bags etc in or take photos in the house.As a 40 something traveller this was one of my favourite places to visit in Bangkok - a taste of what life would have been like in the past. Well worth a visit."

You can take pictures from the street but if you want to walk around entry is extremely cheap (about \u00a31) and this includes a tour, which appeared to be offered in a number of languages. The house itself is home to a some of the Jim Thompson collection of Asian antiques/furniture. Our guide was fantastic, very knowledgable and happy to answer many questions.

Guides are beautifully dressed, well prepared and courteous; albeit their patter is a little roboti and over-rehearsed, and - while questions are answered - they are very good at keeping all on track as per the scheduled tour times etc. Also, one goes through the tour with a guide, at her fairly fast pace; and then are not encouraged to go back and look at anything again on your own and/or in your own time.

The house is quite pretty and has interesting and pretty artifacts. The tour is informative and basic. Nice to see traditional Thai teak wood homes and local historical artifacts. Enjoyed the short visit (we spent about 1.5 hours there in total editing for the tour, exploring the garden, touring, wsyching a silk weaving demonstration and looking in the small shops onsite (postcards and card store and silk shop). The house is pretty conveniently located near national stadium stop, exit 1. Down the stairs from the station there is no sign which way to go, but if you stand facing the street/traffic, go right, within about 15 meters you'll see a sign post directing you to Jim Thompson house (you'll be turning right into the small soi). If you exit the bts station exit 1 and go in the wrong direction you'll end up at siam discover/mbk area shortly. So a visit to Jim Thompson house could easily be paired with a visit to this area as well, as it's only about a 15 min walk away."

The story of his disappearance is really amazing (while they don't talk much about it on the tour - you can find lots of info on wikipedia).I had never heard of Jim Thompson, but then again, I'm not an expert on the Thai silk trade, so maybe that's why.It was nice they had an English tour for no extra charge. The tour was just the right amount of time, not too long, not too short.I wouldn't put this on a MUST SEE list, but it was something to do. Don't eat at the restaurant, the food is bad. BUT the mango passion fruit shake was delicious and perfect on a hot day."

The visit are guided, in several language and offer a glimpse of what was the Thai housing, the traditional art in Siam, and the life of Mr. Thompson who helped the silk industry in Thailand. It is somehow strange to visit one house that has been creating in damaging three traditional one (but it allowed the preservation of it). The deception is that the silk sold in the shop are not all made in Thailand (some are made in Italia), and not all traditional."

This house honours the story of Jim Thompson and his silk empire which is a mgic place to visit right in the middle of the city accessible off the trains. The museum visit through the complex is very worthwhile and a memorable place with great collection of Thai art and relics of the past. The story, the displays, the wonderful timber home, its shop and the displays of gathering the silk from the cacoons and how it ends up in the shop is a gem and one of the wonders of nature. Jim thompsons house should be a must on all itineries when in Bangkok even if it is a short visit, I would like to see more forensic resources allocated to find the remains of Jim Thompson with a reasonable reward with more effort to find the remains of Jim Thompson and close the chapter to honour a committed person who has given so much to his adopted home in Thailand."

The tour was short and sweet, and the English/Japanese/Thai speaking guides were knowledgeable and friendly.I am glad I saw the place, because I was interested in the story of Mr. Thompson. This is presumably why people visit in the first place. The visit did help put a visual to the story. So, it is probably worth seeing, especially if you are either a silk industry buff, an int'l trade buff, a local Bangkok history buff, or some combination of those!One thing that I was put off by was the *very expensive* gift shop, which sold silk products that were labeled \"Made In Italy\"! Ironic at best, shocking at worst."

If only they could have turned their backs for a moment I would have snuck away with everything. The gift shop is exceptional too. I got most of my presents here including the scented candles. For the quality of the stock, the prices are quite reasonable too. I bought lots of the cards which are gorgeous and cost about AUD$1 each - a lot less than the $5 we pay at home. So I stocked up. Whilst we visited there was a huge down pour which made the tour very atmospheric - you could almost imagine living here in the 1950s with the luscious tropical gardens and ponds. I really enjoyed our visit here - more than the palaces and temples. Well worth a visit."

The tour was difficult to follow as a result and we found ourselves drifting off a little. In order to preserve the house, it's shoes off, no photos. This is all very reasonable and you find the same in many restored houses all over the world. Unfortunately, for some reason, JT's house was as a result, a little joyless, taking itself very seriously.We ate at the cafe for lunch - the service was appalling (we waited 15 mins for menus and then a further 30 for food - cold salads - and drinks) and the selection a little dismal compared to real Bangkok.If you are really interested in the history of JT, worth a visit, if not, just go to the large shop - we had far more fun there!"

It's an 'historic' house (though less than 100 years old) that shows how teak buildings worked. It's quite a lovely building, set in a peaceful garden, with lots of antiques. Unlike the average museum, the antiques are where they would have been located in the house and aren't behind ropes or glass. Because of this, you have to take a guided tour and can't just wander by yourself. It's very popular but was really well organised with tours in various languages running every 10 minutes or so, all precisely timed so groups never ran into each other despite the relatively small size of the house. My guide was very knowledgeable and able to answer a wide variety of questions.The shop on site has some nice silk products, but they're quite expensive because they're 'Jim Thompson' silk. The entry fee including the tour was something like AU$5.It's easy to get to - only a block from MBK - and right on one of the klong stops if you're travelling by canal."

It has a nice cafe where you can sit outside right by the koi pond. Everything is very clean and well maintained and the staff can speak many different languages. The only difficulty we had was actually finding the place, as its not signposted and its at the end of what looks like a small side road. We decided to get a taxi there but the taxi driver didnt know where it was so we ended up walking from one of the shopping centres and following our map. If you can find it its a great way to spend a few hours."

It is a very short tour, but it is worth it to kind of magically step out of modern Bangkok into a more simpler time. Basically, you will be taken on a guided tour of his small house that still has most of the original furnishings. You will also get to tour his small yet lovely garden. You may have to wait if there are a lot of tourists there, but the times I have gone I have not had to wait too long. TIPS:1. Take the BTS and get off at National Stadium which is across from MBK. Go down the stairs that are the opposite side of the skytrain from MBK and then take your first soi (small street) on your left. Ignore the touts that may be there trying to tell you that Jim Thompson house is closed. You will have to walk about 100 meters down a less than appealing road, but the attraction is at the very end of the road. 2. Visit the Jim Thompson silk shop that is right on the premises. There is also a small coffee shop as well if you want to pause after your tour before heading back into the noise and excitement of Bangkok."

I traveled with friends who insisted on visiting this attraction. I endured a boring tour through houses made up to look \"authentic\" Thai -- but they were not. The guides did a good job of talking through a practiced script, but ask a mildly complex question and you discover that the English is memorized not understood so much.Somehow this attraction has gotten the reputation as having great silk products. There are many other places you can get these products, of equal or better quality, at prices 70% or more below what you'll pay at the Jim Thompson House. I think there is a mystique about this place because of the oft told story of how the owner disappeared. Beyond that there isn't anything here to see. It's more of something people do to tell people back home they did it.I'd recommend you skip it all.Want a surprisingly good Jim Thompson branded event? Less than 10 minutes walk from the BTS Saladeng train station is the Jim Thompson restaurant -- down a confusing set of streets whose route is difficult to explain. This place had fantastic Thai food -- shockingly good -- but the prices were designed for Westerners only -- no Thai person I know would pay this much for Thai food. But it was one of the best sets of food I've eaten in Thailand."

However the tour felt like a real waste of time. To my mind there were three things that should have been covered in the tour: Jim Thompson the person, the architecture/artefacts and the silk industry and how he saved it. The tour largely ignored the person (a brief history was given because one of the customers asked) and the industry. It gave a very basic introduction to the artefacts he collected, but didn't put any of them in context. It would have been nice to know why the style of statue changed or what was happening in Thailand when the statue was created. The tour guide was lovely, but saying Sawa dee hundreds of time didn\u2019t make up for the lack of substance.Go in with low expectations and the house and grounds will impress you. If you expect to be educated maybe stick to Wikipedia.However, given how positive the other reviews are we might just have been unlucky with our guide."

Jim Thompson lived in Thailand for 25 years and was the founder of the Jim Thompson Thai Silk Company which has become famous worldwide and revitalized the Thai Silk Industry. He was awarded the Order of the White Elephant, a decoration bestowed upon foreigners for having rendered exceptional service to Thailand.  Sadly in 1967 Jim Thompson disappeared while on holiday in the Cameroon Highlands in Malaysia which is another story which is covered well in numerous books. It was after reading some of these books that I decided I wanted to see the house he lived in plus the beautiful jungle gardens, which were designed by William Warren who also designed the stunning gardens at Mom Tri's Villa Royale in Phuket! This magnificent house is actually 6 different old Thai houses that were bought in and reassembled from various places around Thailand to make one large beautiful house, no nails are used and Jim also reversed some walls so he could see the beautiful carved woodwork from inside his house. The house is built on Klong Maha Nag and everyday Jim would row across to see his silk weavers. Now there is a large fence separating the house from the Klong, but it is easy to imagine what life use to be like along this waterway. Jim Thompson loved entertaining and there were dinner parties nearly every night.Jim Thompson was also a collector of beautiful painting, statues and antiques from all over South East Asia and many of these are on display at his house. No photos are allowed to be taken inside the house.There is also a lovely restaurant and bar here plus a small shop selling books and various silk products.Being here was an absolute highlight for me, I have been a Jim Thompson fan for quite a few years and to actually visit his house which has not changed much since he lived there was such an experience, it is a beautiful oasis from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok.The Jim Thompson House is on Soi Kasemsan (2) Song which is opposite the National Stadium on Rama I Rd. It is open everyday from 9am \u2013 5pm and the guided tours are 100baht."

Take your passport or photocopy of it with you. Make sure you thoroughly understand the process of claiming the vat .

A short walk from National Stadium BTS station and MBK, visitors can find the Jim Thompson's House tucked away down at the bottom end of Soi Kasemsan 2, just on the right as you are walking away from the National Stadium BTS station. Great care has been taken to piece together, renovate and a preserve a lovely collection of traditional Thai houses right in the heart of the city's shopping district. I have had the chance to visit on multiple occasions and the tour guides (available in multiple languages) are always professional and interesting, making this remarkable house/museum a must for any visitor. The museum has a lovely collection of antiques and artworks from all over the Southeast Asian region. There is also a cute little Thai restaurant/cafe on site that serves nice food in a very pleasant atmosphere (albeit a little over priced). ALSO.....if you are in the area searching for the location BEWARE of Tuk tuk touts that stalk the area looking for victims. They can be very aggressive, but DO NOT agree to go anywhere with these scam artists. One of Bangkok's notorious Gem factories is one soi over, and they will try their best to get you through the doors to get the commission for serving you up on a platter....so, do yourself a favor and make sure you walk away!"

The tour guide told us that Jim Thompson liked old artifacts that were broken, so most of the statues were headless or missing a few arms. According to the Thai people, broken statues brought bad luck, so that is why he disappeared . . . The house was only two floors and seven rooms, so it was a short tour but very charming.

It you don't know about this man look him up on Wiki. He lived in a Bangkok that is was still the ancient orient some places were a step back into the past. His house has a wonderful cross section of art and buildings from the various periods in SE Asian history. He understood the nuances of Thai culture and designed his house accordingly. It is easy to reach by water Taxi or just walking along the canal from Siam Paragon. The price for silk is high but it is a great place to see superior quality textiles so you know what to look for when you can hit the markets. The trick with silk is more cross thread the better. It also burns like human hair."

Entry is 100BHT for a half hour tour of the house, very interesting, audible and easy in a shoes off way but there are a few stairs if that's your concern. There's a restaurant and bar but way too pricey for my modest budget - Coke 60 BHT here or 17BHT in the 7/11. For the wealthier traveller or those looking to splash out on some lovely gifts, there's a swanky silk shop on site with items for men women and home. We arrived by water taxi - the only way to arrive m'dear! It's one stop from Siam Square (if memory serves correctly) but there's a sign on the jetty anyway and people are very helpful with a nod or a no. What I really like about these sorts of houses though is that they fire your imagination, give you ideas for your own place and for 100BHT, I think it's worth a look and a pleasant way to spend an afternoon in this full-on city."

I've taken all who has visited me here in Thailand and everyone has enjoyed it, even those who didn't think they would. Of course, if you're interested in Thai textiles, Jim Thompson House is a must, but it's also a tresure trove for anyone interested in ceramics and architecture.Also, the Jim Thompson Cafe, right next to his house is a great place to take a break, or have lunch is a lovely setting either outdoors or indoors with air-con.There is a smaller retail shop on site.

The house of the person responsible for making the Thai silk industry renowned the world over is inspiring. The interiors are tastefully done and gives you a flavor of how Jim Thompson embraced the Thai culture.The actual tour is quick but you can actually roam the grounds after the guided tour.

In the garden there is a coffe shop, J Thomson silk shop and a souvenir shop where you can find books and art replicas of the Jim Thomson House. A great place to visit !"

The house is tucked in a very quiet (for BKK) location next to a canal. If one knows what they are doing with river taxis you can actually float all the way there. The house is beautiful, the collection of things more than interesting and the Tour is fun. There is a beautiful fish pond to relax by while you wait for the tour to start. And if you are a male,, the tour guides are an attraction themselves. I highly reccomend checking this out. I took my young daughters and older sister and everyone enjoyed it."

But his house is exactly as it was when he left---so---when you take a house tour you will experience Thailand as it was many years ago. Every person who I have sent to see the Jim Thompson House (they offer a house tour which you will take) has THANKED me for the this recommendation (my other two are the Grand Palace and the reclining Buddha---plus a Canal tour) as \"must sees.

You can tour his house by means of a guided tour and see his collection of Thai and Asian art and crafts there and in smaller buildings that house more of his collection. Entrance fee is 100 baht--about $3.33. There is a lovely garden cafe that serves good food in a relaxed, covered area. The house is near the S1 stop of the Skytrain, near the sports fields.

Thompson was a U.S. soldier stationed in Bangkok during World War II. After the war, he decided to stay and revive traditional Thai silk making. Thompson did really well for himself, and his textile company still bears his name today. Architecturally, his house is interesting because it was constructed from parts of six old Thai houses. It\u2019s also filled with many prints and statues that Thompson collected over the years. Jim Thompson disappeared in the Malaysian jungle in 1967; no one knows what became of him. I wonder if his house would be as much of a tourist attraction if he died in his own bed at the age of 90? The intrigue of Thompson\u2019s disappearance seems to be what fuels tourism at his former residence."

I must say that the history of Jim Thompson in Thailand is intriguing. I had never heard of him before this visit. The story of how he brought back the art of traditional Thai Silk was interesting, but more interesting was his vanishing act. What happened to him still remains a mystery. His home is now a museum of his private collections of art, pottery and furniture. There is a beautiful (quite small) garden and a very very expensive shop on the property that sells (cotton) t-shirts for $35.00 and a variety of expensive purses, neck ties, scarves, fabric, etc. Reminded me more of Macy's than a gift shop. There are no photo's permitted inside the house and no postcards (that I could find) of the inside of the house either. You must remove your shoes to enter and they have lockers available with video camera's pointed at the lockers and two attendants on duty. There are lots of steps to climb and each room had to be stepped into and out of. Try to educate your self a little about Jim Thompson's history before going and maybe you will be more impressed than I was."

It is easy to combine a visit here with either Siam Paragon or MBK shopping mall.I like to bring my visitors here, although not everyone appreciates it (the children tend not to enjoy this place as much). You have to join a 35 minute tour (also available in French, Japanese & Thai apart from English) which takes you around the house Jim Thompson used to live before he disappeared mysteriously in 1967. Jim Thompson was a famous American who helped revive the Thai silk industry. His house was made from teak wood (which is too expensive to use nowadays but good to ward off termites) in a traditional Thai style, albeit with minor changes made to suit his taste. There are lovely artefacts which he collected from different countries over the years. You have to take your shoes off and leave your valuables in a locker before entering. Photography is not allowed indoors.There is a Jim Thompson shop selling products (handbags, cushions, clothing etc.) made from Thai silk and cotton etc. next to the house. There is also a cafe, both outdoors and (air-conditioned) indoors, if you need to rest and have a bite before moving on. My visitors love the fresh coconut juice served in a coconut.Tickets: Baht 100 per adult and Baht 50 per child.Take a BTS to National stadium, look for sign leading to Jim Thompson House. After comingdownthe stairs, doubleback (i.e. do 180 degrees turn) and turn right at Soi Kasem San 2 street. Sometimes there are tuk-tuks that take you from this point to the Jim Thompson house which is at the end of the street. Only a 5-10 minute lesurely walk though."

The whole place is stuffed full of Jims antique collecting, including some of the oldest works of Thai art remaining. Well worth a visit to get the idea of how the design of these houses works, and especially if you like to get some high quality Thai Silk from the shop on site. Dont forget to stop for coffee and cheese cake, i dint know whether to frame the cherry cheesecake and use it as a work of are or eat it. I did the latter and it was probably the bast flavoured one I have had for many a year."

The explanations given were concise, interesting and relevant.Overall, it's a stunning yet peaceful experience and also a nice retreat from the urban madness that is Bangkok. The gift shop has a few interesting books, cards and posters as well as generally higher-quality silk products, but no statues, carvings or tapestries (which I thought would have been a nice fit).Definitely a must-see if you're in Bangkok, even more so if you're wat-ed out."

Tours are offered in English, French, and Thai and although you cannot take photos inside his house, you can around the grounds. The tours are well-done, although sometimes you can feel a little rushed because they have the tours so close together. You cannot see the house without a tour, but you can explore a bit on your own after your tour has ended. A little different, but it seems to work for them.The store on the grounds is way, way too high priced - I should not have been, but I was shocked when I saw the tags on some of the items (I ended up buying my silk in Chiang Mai).

Walking into the grounds was like leaving Bangkok and entering a different world. Lush gardens, clear pools, and a very noticeable... quiet.When you purchase your admission you're assigned to a tour group and time based on the language in which you want to hear the tour. There are a couple of shops and a bar/restaurant on the grounds where you can kill time if necessary. The tour itself is pretty interesting, as you get to walk through the various rooms and the guide explains why things were built or laid out a certain way, or the significance of certain pieces throughout the house. And of course Jim Thompson's biography has some interesting chapters, too. The tour is fairly short (you're just going through a house, after all), so you're not going to become bored or tired before it's finished.The Jim Thompson House doesn't have the allure of the Grand Palace or the various temples, but it's a wonderfully refreshing change of pace after you've spent a day in the hustle and bustle of Bangkok. If you have a couple of hours to kill I'd recommend a visit."

The Jim Thompson House is definitely worth a visit if you are looking for something interesting to do and you have seen all the other \"bigger attractions\". It is very close to the Siam shopping area and only a couple minutes walk from the Klong Baen Sap canal stop of Ban Krua Nua (which is an adventure in itself!). When you arrive, buy your ticket and the nice ladies will walk you to another counter where they will sign you up with a tour in your language. Be prepared to wait 10 - 30 minutes for you tour to start. While you wait, there is a very expensive gift shop selling Jim Thompson silk, a beautiful garden to explore and a restaurant, there is also an art gallery. You are not allowed to enter the main house without a tour guide but the outside houses are open for you to explore either before or after your tour. Jim Thompson's collection is very impressive and the house is beautiful but I would not take the time for this unless you have several days in Bangkok."

His house, which is a collection of several old Thai houses relocated to Bangkok on the edge of a klong, is well worth a visit. JT house is walking distance from National Stadium. You do not need to get a tour to visit this house. Except for monks holidays it is open every day. You buy a ticket, leave your shoes and bags in a personal locker that you hold the key for and take a tour - a few languages are offered. There is a lovely coffeeshop on the grounds as well as the shop where you can buy beautiful JT products of silk, cotton, etc - this shop is expensive but superb. If you have time to go to the JT outlet - (see my other review) you will find cheaper items but it is a fair way out of town on the train or 20 minutes by taxi (off peak).Combine this visit (you need approx 2 hours) with lunch and shopping at MBK (see my MBK review)"

There is a small cafe/restaurant that also does reasonable food and coffee, but you could also walk up to Paragon or Central World after a visit for a feed just as easily. Two tips for a \"real\" Bangkok experience: 1. catch a khlong (canal) boat on the Saem Seap canal to get to the house (the actual pier is about 200m walk from the house, but easy to get to after getting off the boat); and, 2. find the pedestrian bridge near Jim Thompson's house that takes you across the canal to the neighbourhood called Baan Khrua where the old silk workers still have looms etc."

At the Jim Thompson House. It is a tropical garden with old wooden Thai houses filled with antiques. Feels like travelling back in time from the modern city. The old houses and the antiques all have an interesting history but there is also modern history to be learned. The very interesting history of Jim Thompson. The caf\u00e9 and restaurant is also very good and relaxing. If you like shopping. Go to the malls in after breakfast. When need a break for lunch. Leave the malls and have lunch here instead. Much more relaxing! After lunch and a sightseeing tour of the grounds your batteries will be recharged for more shopping!"

The house is viewed as part of a guided tour, very interesting and the house is absolutely beautiful. The Thai's obviously have a lot of respect for Jim Thompson and he clearly respected the Thais when he built the house. Set in beautiful gardens it is a photographers haven. The small gift shop is good for cards and postcards, the larger gift shop more expensive fabric items. There is a cafe by the pond and they serve delicious and beautiful food at reasonable prices - well worth a stop to cool down before or after your tour."

It's a fascinating home of grand traditional architecture amidst beautiful albeit small tropical gardens. One of the highlights for me was spotting giant flower pots which housed populations of tiny colourful fish - wonderfully creative urban ponds. The artefacts gathered by this American entrepreneur are incredible - from traditional stone buddhas hundreds of years old to intricate furniture. The dark panelling of the wood offers a warm, soothing sanctuary that acts as a welcome escape from the bustle of Siam only a short walk away. The staff offer tours in a multitude of languages and although not always easy to understand they are very enthusiastic.A couple of words of warning - the adjacent canal stinks!! I mean truly truly stinks so be careful if walking next to the fence in the garden so as not to get splash by the fetid water. Also you'll need to take your shoes off to walk around the house so be prepared to have clean socks ;o) Also no photography is allowed in the house which is a shame. I was dubious about visiting an attraction that was in effect based upon a westerner's ideals - however Jim Thompson (though no longer with us) has done a tremendous job of preserving and combining a small slice of Thai culture amidst a bustling modern metropolis."

Jim Thompson had amazing taste... the grounds are immaculate- gorgeous gardens and lots of buildings to walk around and inside. Really one of the best examples of great design in the world. Pay for the tour so that you can go into the houses. If you cannot afford/or don't have the time, you can still wander around the grounds (even though it looks like you can't). This place captured my imagination sort of like the Swiss Family Robinson at Disneyland in the 70's did. This would be post rescue and large family inheritance, and some schooling in architecture, oh, and they became art collectors. There is also great store here, and what looked like a nice restaurant. Note: Save your money and shop across the canal at the Baan Krua muslim neighborhood where the original silk weavers lived and worked. You can still find a couple here today. Really cool to see them making the product from end to end and being able to purchase at a great price. I love this place so much that I purchased a book about the house and all of the collections so that I could study further."

However, I wanted to write about the staff, who were truely extraordinary. When we reached this place, we realized our cab had left with our camera bag. We reported this to the staff at the Jim Thompson house and they immediately swung into action. They called my hotel and found out the number of my cab (the hotel had reserved the cab). Then they called the cab company and got the cab driver's phone number. Then they talked with the cab driver. They did all of this when we were looking at the house - so when we completed our visit they had already worked out a date and time when the cab driver would meet with us and return us our camera. It took a few more phone calls to the cab driver to get everything straightened out, but the staff took care of all the conversations to help us with the language barriers. The staff at this house were really very helpful and went out of their way to talk patiently with us, find out where we were staying, what our plans were for the day and the next day, and when they should advise the cab driver to bring back our camera. Lesson learned - write down the number of the cab you drive in, so you can get back in touch if necessary."

Its only 100B each so it wont break the bank.You have to go on a guided tour, which they offer in a number of languages. Its good that they make you do that because if you just walked around yourself you would be done in 10 minutes flat and wouldnt see or learn anything. It was quite interesting to learn about traditional Thai houses and also Jim Thompson himself. The gardens are pretty nice to. They had a little free art exhibit as well which was worth a look round.The gift shop is typically overpriced as is the restaurant. We didnt eat anything there, why would you in my mind when you can eat better and more authentic food for a fraction of the price in any number of local places. If you are in the area then its worth popping in but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here if you have to pay for a taxi / tuk tuk."

            "review": "5-star!. Jim Thompson house museum is a collection of Thai traditional houses that were acquired by Jim during his residency in Thailand. When one enter the complex; Jim Thompson store was directly located near the entrance. The second floor was used as exhibition hall. Across the store; another building houses the ticket booth and the restaurant and bar. Price to enter the museum is THB100 per adult with students only need to pay half. After buying the ticket, you will be greeted by the museum attendant and brought to the briefing center and assigned your guided tour time. You can wander around the ground, but to access the inside of the houses; you'll need a guide. There is no option to wander around inside the houses on your own. My tour guide was Ann, a Thai with Chinese descent. She was witty, informative, yet cheerful bringing the tour in lively manner. She claimed to be a newbie, but the way she conducted the tour is just as smooth as professional guide. She tried to become a good host on showing around the house without making the session too monotone and yet still managed to capture all the details. Tour began with exploring the garden and passing around few smaller pavilion such as printing house, rice storage, spirit house, etc. Then before entering the main house (few Thai traditional houses connected into a single house), one needs to take off the shoes. Ann later mentioned one of the reason was because traditional Thais do many activities on the floor, so it is preferred to be bare feet inside the house. Inside the house; the tour began at the bencharong room which houses the former store, then continue to dining room, main hall, study room, guest bedroom, and Jim's master bedroom. Along the way, Ann was describing every details of interesting facts and demonstrate some interesting ideas behind the houses. The tour ended just by the staircase leading to the shoe storage. Afterwards, you are free to roam around the garden once again, take photos, or shop at the souvenir store inside the museum complex or Jim Thompson boutique in front. However, no photography inside the main houses. Access: take BTS to National Stadium and take exit 1, walked pass the shophouses until you reach Soi Kasemsan 2 (there is a big signage in Thai and English pointing to Jim Thompson house museum), enter the narrow lane and walk around 300m until the end of the lane. The museum is directly to the left by the canal. Verdict: the success of the tour depends greatly on how your guide takes you on the tour. My tour session was nonetheless the best part of the whole visit to Jim Thompson house museum thanks to the great guide! A love/fascination in architecture, design, arts, and culture will also help to enjoy the whole experience. Will I recommend to others: absolutely!Will I return again to Jim Thompson house museum: definitely!"

The tour of the house was compulsory, we had to leave our bags in lockers and remove shoes when entering the house (so make sure your socks do not have holes on the day you are visiting). The tour guide was very pleasant and knowledgable, and after she had finished speaking, we had time to look around each room on our own before moving on. It is a relatively small house (even though it is actually many traditional Thai houses that Jim Thompson connected together to make his home), though we did not bump into any other groups when on our tour. You cannot take pictures inside the house, but it did not bother me as that is something that is very common in old houses in the UK.We were free to wander the cool and shady gardens at will. It easy to forget that you are in the centre of a busy city when there. At only B100 (approx \u00a32) entry for an adult, I thought it was very good value. The house is a westerners interpretation of tradition Thai living so is not for those who want an authentic Thai experience.There is an exhibition centre, that shows the history of post WWII Thailand through newspaper articles, and an film about Tim Johnson. It is in English with Thai subtitles. The film looked as if it had been made in the 1970s, and though not modern was quaint. It did focus a bit too much on his disappearance for my liking, and there were too many melodramatic scenes and music towards the end.It is very easy to get to, being an only 5min walk from National Stadium skytrain stop. I would not recommend a visit for wheelchair users as there are steps into all buildings except the shop and restaurant. We were there for a couple of hours, and by the time we left it was becoming more busy. I would therefore recommend an early morning visit."

The gift shop, silk shop, museum and cafe have all been added over the years so there are literally hundreds of people on the grounds at any given time. The cafe is nice if you can sit beside the koi pond for the view; otherwise it is pretty pricey for what you get."

The tours are compulsory and bags must be left in lockers but then its easy to stay a while and browse through again. The artifacts, porcalaine and fabrics are fabullous and its facinating to see now the original houses were fitted together. Indeed the shop is pricey but high quality, but the cafe by the pool is charming.I loved the Spirit house by the gate. Just outside the site its possible to see the Klong on which the house was built, at the end of the lane. One day I'll work out how to get there by public longtail, it must be possible."

Overall, the tour and Jim Thompson\u2019s story turned out to be much better than I expected because am not usually interested in silk or fashion. In one of the major Bangkok malls, I had wandered into one of the Jim Thompson stores. Based on the cover notes of a biography on display, I made the decision to take the extra step of visiting the museum. His biography is one that lends itself to a Hollywood movie. Cost of the tour is 100 Baht. You are placed in a group based on language, and wait time for my English tour was about 15 minutes. Learned a little about Thai architecture, history, superstitions, etc. For me, it was a pleasant change of pace in comparison to the high rises of Bangkok. In my opinion, this is a \u201clove it or hate it\u201d kind of tour. First, study a map because the location is tucked away and is not well marked. Its GPS coordinates are N 13 44.954\u2019 E 100 31.692\u2019 Second, the tour is not designed for the disabled. There are a few flights of stairs and door ways with relatively high thresholds to step over. Third, be prepared to remove your footwear upon entering the home\u2014ie make sure your socks do not have holes in them and/or your ultra white socks may get a little dirty. Fourth, you are expected to lock you handbags, backpacks, etc in one of their free lockers. Fifth, taking photos is not permitted within certain locations.Would recommend to others visiting Bangkok."

Set in landscaped gardens, are six Thai Teak houses that was once home to the legendary American businessman who rejuvenated the Thai silk industry in the 1950\u2019s & 60\u2019s. The houses are filled with priceless collections of Asian antiques, paintings, carvings etc: and stone sculpture found within the gardens. A lovely Oasis in the heart of bustling Bangkok, so go along and enjoy! Once you have bought your entrance ticket, you will be asked to wait about 10mts to join a guided tour (inclusive of your ticket price), around the complex of houses (afterward, you are free to walk around the landscaped gardens at your leisure). The guide we had was very informative and engaged us in what we were looking at and enjoyed hearing about Jim Thompson\u2019s life style portrayed through items in the houses. You are asked not to photograph the inside the houses, but free to do so from the outside, and there are plenty of great shots to be taken. There are terrapins and various fish in the ponds, set amongst the jungle like flora and fauna, quite a variety to be seen.The shop on site sells a variety of silk items from handkerchiefs and clothing to wall hangings and other novelty items. There is a restaurant on site that seemed popular, but since we were in the heart of Siam and spoilt for choice of where to eat, opted not to eat here.Open daily 09.00 a.m. - 05.00 p.m. Admission 100 BahtGet the Sky Train to (W1) National Stadium Station (Silom Line). Take Exit 1, walk straight ahead and take the 1st side road onto your right (Soi Kasemsan 2 road) - Jim Thompson's house is on left side at the end of this road (5mts walk, if that)"

Our first trip to Thailand and elected to begin in Bangkok, to include making some passing observations of the seedier environs that are easily stumbled upon. Given the time, the Jim Thompson House is worth a visit, especially since it is so convenient to the Sky Train. The home itself is conceptually unique and memorable, moreso for the construction and overall design, bearing in mind that this was one man's personal residence. The 35 minute tour itself is somewhat superficial and rushed, but spending the extra time alloted to enjoy and photograph the small gardens and how they were incorporated into extensions of the living areas was a pleasure. Not recommended for children, as they'll be bored, restless and distracting, but worthwhile for the mature visitor interested in a unique exhibit."

I loath being hearded around like sheep. But the worst insult by far is that you are not allowed to take photos. I said ' but I won't use flash' and was proceeded to be told that flash had a negative impact on the antitques. I know that, and respect it, but as a high end camera user I had NO intention of using flash. Simply put, they want to rush you through with the quickest, dumbest 'tour; possible to move as manh people through as possible in the shortest time possible. Sad."

If you have any interest in Thai architecture, Buddhist imagery, Thai silk or \"the way things used to be,\" this is worth a visit. The tour lasts about 40 minutes and you get a good feeling for what it must have been like to be an expat in Thailand in the 50's. Tours are available in many languages. The grounds are small, but very peaceful. There is also a Jim Thompson store selling whatever sorts of silk or JT branded stuff you may need. I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't buy just plain silk from there. There is also an excellent cafe which serves a killer lychee blended drink and also some very good albeit pricey Thai food.

Exhibition hall is also fun; this year they had an exhibition of burmese fabrics with some commentary about the female weavers and how it all relates to varied cultural roots. (see, that anthropology degree decades ago came in useful after all!)seriously, though, it is fabulous and a great place for lunch. you can go thai, or if you need a western hit, they do a great tuna sandwich. Made all the more exciting when I learned from my mom that JT lived in Delaware next to my grandmother in the early 20th century; amazing what a global world it really is.Can't afford the silks, although we have bought a few things there. However, the greeting cards (blank inside) are of the JT designs and are the nicest I have found anywhere in the world, and they're a bargain, less than 50 pence a card so a real bargain. We buy dozens and use them for all family birthday cards and so forth. if you want the real Jim T silk items, there is an outlet store with last years designs at huge reductions- it's a short taxi away from the last skytrain stop (same as Tesco) and a great place for products or fabric at knocked down prices."

The house is a showcase of traditional Thai design and provides a multitude of ideas for what to buy ELSEWHERE.The major complaint you often hear about this joint is that its hard to find. Nonsense! Your map is probably wrong and the tuk-tuk driver may want to take you someplace where he can get a commission, but you're smarter then that! If you depart the North-west exit of the National Stadium sky-train station and head a few meters to the west, you cannot miss Soi Kasemsan 2 (there is a big blue sign for the road/JT House and its the only alley before you hit a major road). JT's house is at the northern end of this alley (just before the canal) on the left. You'll know you're in the right place because of the 5 tuk-tuks lined up waiting for tourists to require a ride to the next attraction. Most metered taxis and a good portion of tuk-tuks will get you there without any problems on the first try. Simple.The big attraction is the house--cobbled together from several other Thai houses to create a fusion-architectural layout. Why not just go see a Thai house? Because this house showcases the differences between Thai and Eastern design. Plus, the guides have some of the best foreign language skills in the city--so you'll be sure to understand the tour! In addition to the architectural beauty, the house also showcases a variety of antiques and design motifs that are worth a look. The pictures, decorations and furniture are amazing. Each time I visit the house, I find something new that I want to purchase--but from one of the markets, not from the over-priced store.One of the things that makes this house so nice is that it provides an oasis in the middle bustling Bangkok. It really does feel like a jungle in the gardens. Yes, Bangkok is still throbbing on the outside, but this place seems a bit calmer and cooler. After seeing everything that you'd like to purchase elsewhere, it's an easy walk over to MBK or the rest of the Siam Square stores to find the real bargains.To be honest, I have not eaten in the restaurant in years because it was not too good the first two times I tried it. I could see why people like it, but it was a little more westernized than I like and just tasted a bit bland compared to the nearby alternatives. The store is beautiful, but I never spend more than 2 minutes in there. Everything is expensive, compared to what you'll find elsewhere in the city.So in summary: be persistent and you will find the Jim Thompson House. Once you get there, you will not be disappointed--unless you are looking for good food and a bargain."

Unlike many sites Jimmy T's house (we're close friends) is off the main road and set in a quiet side street with easy access by the skytrain, and has a calmness and beauty about it in its architecture and setting. Probably one of the best places you can see in Bangkok, you get a guided tour and a quick history lesson and there's a place to grab something to eat or drink out of the heat and in a relaxed setting."

No other place open to the public gives you a comprable idea of the beauty, simplicity and sophistication of the Thai domestic arts. It's very inspiring and educational at the same time as being pleasurable. I go every time I visit Bangkok - before I go shopping."
