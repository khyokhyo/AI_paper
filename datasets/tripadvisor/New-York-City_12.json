Tour guide was knowledgable, friendly and obviously loved her job! The interior is Art Deco style, lavioushly decorated and well looked after especially when at some time in its history, it was going to be flatten! The tour takes you to areas not normally seen and you just see so much of its history and why it is a special venue. Met a gorgeous Rockets and had the chance to ask question and see just how amazing these girls are especially when it is so hard to become a dancer here. A must see venue in NY and if possible, see a snow - they were getting it ready for the Christmas Special Shows, which was a shame as we didn't get a chance to book before we left NY. A good reason to return..."

The helpfulness from staff was amazing, we wanted a tour before our visit to the Top of the Rock and even though the tour had just started, they accommodated us well.Our tour guide was Melissa who was such a lovely, enthusiastic and professional person. She expertly shared all the beauty and history of the building and made the 75 mins fly by. Even my 14yr old daughter loved it.Radio City Music hall is a stunning building filled with Art Deco and 1930s original pieces. Even the foot pedalled hand driers in the 'restrooms' are beautiful! The stage is so carefully thought out...I definitely would like to return to see the Rockettes in action in the Christmas Spectacular one day...fingers crossed."

Last visited Radio City many years ago when the tour was very short, not informative and left out many areas (although at the time they did show you the *STAR* dressing rooms.This visit could not have been more different. Started with an introduction to Angel, our guide for the day. Angel was incredibly informed and enthusiastically shared her knowledge of the venue with us throughout the tour. The foyer where you meet is small and not very impressive but once you go through the doors and see the huge and impressive area before the auditorium and hear the history, look at the staircase and wall art you cannot not be impressed with what you see. From there we went to see the ladies and gents toilets and heard the stories behind the decoration, statues, mirrors and gold leaf! We then went through a maze of corridors until we were under the hydraulic stage and heard the story behind that and saw the size and drop of it.We then saw a full working model of the stage and were encouraged to take photos of it. We then made our way, via the beautifully ornate lifts, to the balcony area in where we were able to look into the auditorium (unfortunately as there was a rehearsal soundcheck taking place we were unable to take photos or enter the auditorium (something to do with artistic copyright I expect) which was a shame. Angel told us more about the auditorium, its size, history, stage curtains (very interesting) and lighting. We then toured more corridors emblazoned with posters of events from the past and saw the rehearsal rooms (there is footage of Adele on You Tube in one of these) and then on to the highest area where we went to where the projectors and follow spotlights are. This is also the area where Presidents and uber-celebrities sit in a private room away from the paying audience, so they can enjoy the shows in peace no doubt! The view and quality of sound from here was stunning and although we have not been to a show I would be more than happy to sit that far back and still be able to see and hear things. We then saw a short history of the venue before our tour finished. Our guide Angel was just that, and deposited us back in the large foyer before we left to go back in to the NY sunlight. The experience could only have been bettered if we had been able to have a full back-stage tour and stand on the stage to experience the view performers see from the stage and see the dressing rooms, unfortunately this was not to be on this visit. Maybe next time...."

            "review": "Beautiful venue but in need of some logistical reworking. Radio City Music hall is a beautiful historic theatre and music venue - this is undeniable. However, after attending a few shows here, I am repeatedly disappointed with the procedures regarding entry into the venue. Despite arriving quite early for shows (even before the posted times for official opening of the doors, I have missed significant segments of performances due to the snail-like speed with which people are admitted. From the process of queuing to ticket scanning and security, everything takes too long, and they need to figure out a more efficient method. If I pay over $100 for a show and line up well in advance, there is no excuse for making me late for the show. This happens to a significant portion of the audience at each show I have attended and as such it is also incredibly distracting (if you do make it in on time) because ushers are frequently bringing in people late, thereby interrupting the viewing experience. Amazing venue, but not an optimal viewing experience. My advice, get there early."

A great opportunity to see a beautiful building and hear a little about its history, which you wouldn't get to appreciate from attending a show. You get to meet a real Rockette ! and have the obligatory photo taken with her. At $22 for just the photo and $27 in a cardboard frame it's a bit pricey, but a nice souvenir. You do get to keep your entry pass on a lanyard though...Watch out for the stairs if you're not fit and able. Even though you are given the opportunity to use the elevator to go up, you still have to walk down two flights of stairs! The guide was very good, and had obviously learnt her stuff but was a little sergeant major- like! She was pretty humourless and repeatedly barked orders at the group. Very funny though. Tour lasts about an hour."

The first time I took my husband, I thought I lost him--but found him just staring at the ceiling! The building is an architectural wonder and just beautiful. Seats inside are comfortable and I don't think there is a bad seat in the house to see the shows. I have been in the front as well as the very last row in the balcony---and always enjoyed the shows. I have been there several times to see the Rockettes, especially for their Christmas show. Taking youngsters there makes it not only fun for me, but so much fun to just watch the wonder on their faces! From the dancers to the actors, to the music, to the Christmas story with live animals (including camels). Of course Santa is a hit, the 3-D segment is dazzling, and the way the light dances around the whole auditorium is fascinating! I have been there for other shows too, mostly concerts. The stage is large and the acoustics are wonderful for music. I would encourage everyone to go and enjoy their shows."

They explain a lot about how the show happens, the technical part and all, and the culture of the presentations, which makes you a little bit more knowledgeable about the American cultural recent history. I was a bit frustrated, though, because when you buy the ticket they tell you that you'll meet one of the Rockettes, have the opportunity to ask questions and see her perform a little bit. I didn't know about the existence of the Rockettes until that day, to be quite honest, but I like dance, so I was excited to see that. But we just met one of them, took a picture side by side, asked questions and left. There was no mini show or performance or anything. But, anyway, it was interesting to meet her.Inside, everything's very beautiful, very elegant. When I got there, I was trying to find where I was supposed to buy the tickets, and there was a guy that asked, in a bothered way, \"Are you here for the audition?\" I confess: I almost said yes just to see what he was talking about hahaha. Later I discovered they were making auditions for the Christmas season (which is, I heard, the biggest one in the year). In case you're lost like me, it's important to know that, if you haven't bought the tickets yet (and I recommend you do, because I paid 27 dollars on the spot, and I had seen on the internet for 20), the place to buy them is in the candy store right next to Radio City."

I was lucky enough to be in NYC last week while one of my favourite bands (Lake Street Dive) were playing Radio City, so I just had to get a ticket and pay a visit.First thing to say is the place is HUGE! It surely must be one of the biggest seated theatres in the world (6000 capacity) and it takes your breath away walking into the auditorium for the first time. The 'sunbeam' arches on the ceiling, coupled with the ornate lobby, and even the grand entrance to the bathrooms on the lower floor, all add to the wow factor at Radio City. The only negatives I can say is that drinks are typical New York prices ($10-11 a beer). Also, I've heard that given how large it is, the seats up on the higher tiers can feel very distant from the stage. I'd therefore recommend trying to get reasonably central tickets on the bottom floor for the best views, within the first ten or fifteen rows from the stage (I was in row LL).I had a great night at Radio City anyway, with a brilliant performance from Lake Street Dive. A truly memorable night in one of the world's most iconic theatres!"

The special effects during the live show were phenomenal! Words cannot express the experience. And, the Rockettes were beyond amazing. Their part of the show was somewhat modernized yet in keeping with the tradition that is the Rockettes. The \"Singing in the Rain\" sequence was worth the price of admission alone.

The security checks before entering the building were quick but thoroughly - better for the safety. Inside there's many space to sit or walk around. In the concert room itself, you have a good view from all places, I guess. We were sitting at the first tier and were satisfied with our chosen seats. The music was really very loud - so for some might it be better taking hearing protection."

It still has its old school Art Deco thing going on and well if you have a chance to see a band or just go you won't be disappointed! The only downfall might have been the lines for the bathroom and the lines to get a drink!! Be prepared to be patient but other than that can't beat it!"

Our seats were pretty good, second balcony, and the seats were very comfortable. The acoustics there are amazing and ELO sounded great that night. The ticket stated that they were on at 8 p.m. and that wasn't the case. They didn't appear until 9 and that gave people plenty of time to get lubricated, which later produced some of the typical obnoxious concert behavior that I have complained about so many, many times. There was one bimbo who got so plastered that she decided to stand in the aisle and wiggle herself until she almost fell. Eventually and usher came in and told her to sit down. Within a minute she was up again and again the usher had to come in. There was no telling this drunk anything; she was up a third time and back into the aisle. I wouldn't have cared except that naturally, she was right in front of us! What's new...Luckily, I was able to spot two empty seats and we moved to them. By this time there were other wiggling fannies in front of us but it was toward the end of the show and the ushers didn't bother to tell those people to sit down. I wonder if anyone's actually fallen over the balcony. Other than those things, the music itself was great and I'm glad that ELO is still touring."

We were a group of about 20-25 eager visitors who were shown this magnificent building. The tour guide was articulate and told us a wealth of information of the building. She answered many questions and at the end we had a short film with the history of the building followed by a question and answer time by one of the Rockets (you could have your photo taken with her, if you wished). I think it ran about 1- 1/2 hour, but the time went by quickly. You must see the ladies room which still looked like 1927."

It was nice, but I really wanted to get into RCMH!!Anyway, purchased tickets thought the website. Got \"better: seating due to Chase card. Some people say to sit far back to see it all, but I have to disagree. We were about 5 rows back and it was PERFECT. That said, I would sit in ANY seat to see them.The venue was BREATHTAKING. I got tears in my eyes when we walked it. I am so glad we got the tickets and went. Worth every penny.The show was SPECTACULAR. It was a good show to see as a tourist, as it showed all the different areas. The music was great, the girls looked good and it was a nice evening.The entry was sort of a mess. We arrived just before the show was going to start. Instead of a line, it was a mob to get in. Took a while to get our bags poked, etc. If you are planning on going, give yourself at least 30 minutes. Also, at the end of the evening, we lined up to get our picture with a Rockette (you pay), and got in line to buy merchandise. We then headed to the bathroom and were given GRIEF. Show's over, go home. Rude. Sorry we were in line spending money. We were not able to use the toilet before the show because it took all our time to get in, then could not get in after due to the lines. Maybe a little more understanding that customers have a right to pee!! :)"

I use to sit in ore and watch these when i was a little girl.There was so much glamour , the costumes and sets are very authentic.The building itself is steeped in history , to the likes of Lizza Minnelli appearing there, , the sweeping staircase really gives you a true insight of what an important venue Radio City is. I loved it so much i will be going back again this year."

This one really fitted the bill. All of our kids aged from 7-12 got something out of it, whether it was the music, the dancing or the special effects. There was of course a little bit of glitz and glamour about it all so the adults enjoyed it too, especially with the excellent seats coming in at a mere $50 a head, which is a snip compared to Broadway. The story of two kids lost by their love struck parents at Grand Central is a little stretched of course, but it provides a workable backdrop for an uplifting dance across the Manhattan skyline and the attractions that it has to offer. All in all a great family night out."

After all that, I promptly found my seat and then enjoyed a remarkable show which highlighted the sights and sounds of NYC from Central Park to the Battery and the Statue of Liberty. Special effects, lighting, a rain storm on stage, dancing and singing statues, buskers, the Rockettes, a live orchestra all contributed to the story of two children looking for their parents. A very enjoyable 2.5 hour production."

The tour was 75 minutes long and we walked all through the lobby side of the hall. You don't actually get to go back stage or see the dressing rooms. It is more about the history of Radio City, which was quite fascinating. The Summer Spectacular show was truly spectacular. From the moment the Rockettes came out out stage for the opening Heartbeat of NY number to the kick line at the end, it was amazing! The show was just long enough (~90 minutes) to keep your interest, especially for kids. The food was pricey- $9 for a small popcorn in a souvenir cup but we had our own water so that saved some money. We can't wait to see the Christmas show!"

All the actors were great and having males in the dance numbers really made it feel like a Broadway show. The tix were reasonable....$70 for floor and it was a matinee. Even my friends, who aren't really show people, loved it. Had you singing as you left the show, so that's normally my indicator of a good time. If you like dancing and musical theatre, then this should be on your list of things to do in NYC."

From a visit to the practice room, costume rooms & the exhausting display of those who have performed was breathtaking...topped with a chance to meet a Rockette!However, the best part was the matinee performance of THE NEW YORK SPECTACULAR. With seats 6 rows from the stage, center aisle, we were treated to the \"extras\" of 'money' falling from the sky & of 'flying pixies' floating down upon us. This was a magical afternoon.

We didn't get to attend a show in the Hall, but we did take the tour and were able to see some neat, behind-the-scenes things/places that most folks never get to see if they simply go to a show. A lot of history in this place. The tour guide we had was nice enough and informative about the history and unique things in the Hall, but she was a bit dry. I think she was probably tired of saming the same things over and over so many times each day on the tours and it was obvious. She tried to cover it up by being pleasant, but I could tell she wasn't a happy camper. The people that supervise and give the tours are rather strict at times and make you feel as if though you may've just entered a military boot camp instead of an entertainment venue. Don't stray too far or they'll order you to get back in line! You go to the bathroom when they tell you to go to the bathroom and they give you 3 minutes ...really?! ... 3 minutes?. I can understand that they don't want to let people freely roam around a place like this without a chaperone or guide, but they were a bit over the top on this when they wanted you to do, or not do, something. I'm a rule followerer type person in most instances until I think the rules are becoming overly strict for no good reason and I felt that way on this tour. We were waiting in line for the tour inside the ticket lobby and decided to sit down on the floor next to a wall and one of the people said we were not allowed to do sit and made us stand up. It wasn't like there were 100 people in the area waiting to take the tour ... there were maybe 10 people around. To say the least, they run a \"very tight ship\" and could loosen up a bit. The general attitude of the tour guide folks was .... \"let's get these folks in here, get them through the tour in the exact time allotted for a tour, and then send them out a side door so we can do something else that is more meaningful with our lives\" ... and this attitude showed during the entire tour. It wasn't horrible, but they can do better."

The openness is breathtaking while the layered ceiling illuminates every part of the music hall. The show was outstanding! The musicians, band, and orchestra take full spotlight upon the opening, and then the show begins. What a clever way to dialogue NYC, through the journey of a family on vacation, interacting with all the statues that have become famous here in NYC.The precision of the rockettes, mixed with the ensemble of boys who danced their hearts out, and the energy of the swing = BEYOND AMAZING. The whole time I was anticipating what was next. There was humor, imagination, energy, and love in every sequence. Some of my favorite parts included the NY Library, 7th Avenue Fashion, Broadway/Times Square, and of course, the finale (which had every touch of class that is NYC).Highly recommend this show to everyone and anyone.

We were a little apprehensive because we didn't think it would be as good as the Christmas show. Well, to our pleasant surprise, the show far exceeded our expectations. It was very entertaining. The special effects & sets were incredible. They have everything from dynamic graphics to talking / moving statues. The show holds your attention from beginning to end. My two favorite scenes were the Vogue Fashion show and the Rockettes dancing & singing in the rain. Great family show. Highly recommend seeing it!"

Our guide was so knowledgeable, gave us lots of time for photos and was obviously so enthusiastic about her job. The Rockette we met was very friendly and happy to answer our questions. Our decision to do the tour was a spur of the moment decision and so glad we did. We were inspired to buy tickets for the show in the evening (we got a discount for attending the tour) and it was great. Amazing sets and effects, great for kids and the Rockettes are amazing. Highly recommended."

We all enjoyed hearing and seeing the Hall. Since our visit was during a Rocketts performance, we didn't actually get to go backstage. However we were thrilled to meet one of the Rocketts (Sierra, I think was her name) and got to view the costumes room, among other areas of the Hall. It was a good tourist stop."

The story was good and took the audience around a variety of New York landmarks. I have to say however, the stage lighting was fantastic. It really drew the audience into the stage and you felt as if you were going on the journey with the actors.My only criticism is the inconsiderate audience members who insist on ignoring the request at the start of the show not to take photos with flash or film portions of the show. There were several audience members who did this and the light from their phone cameras was very distracting . One family in front of us constantly took photo's to the point that we felt we had to challenge them - we were then faced with a barrage of abuse! When we spoke to a member of Radio City staff about it, they only shrugged their shoulders. Perhaps it's something that Radio City staff need to consider and either allow audience to take photos / video of the show or police it better. A good show which could have been great."

Even if you are not interested in theatre, this tour is worth it for the history and background of this building.Not only do you get to hear about how the place was built but you see and experience history.Small things like the original mens and ladies rest rooms, with original furniture and pedal operated hand dryers to the naked sculpture in front of them and how it caused a stir, to the private dining room up to how the rehearsal floors are laid out, to actually meeting a Rockette (unfortunately she was not free for dinner the day we met) this was a really interesting tour.Plenty of walking but if you are not good at walking you will be ushered around in lifts. I doubt that a wheel chair would be suitable however.Our guide was obviously passionate about the theatre - he had worked there for a long time and he knew the history and lay out.I really enjoyed this tour and would not hesitate to recommend it to all, but probably to people with a bent for architecture."

Looks like it was be a great show. You have to either buy your tickets or exchange your show voucher in the gift shop next to RCMH. If you decide you want to buy a souvenir, wait until after the tour because the badge they give you at the beginning of the tour entitles you to a discount (20% I think) to merchandise in the gift shop AND the purchase of show tickets but I'm not sure how much discount on tickets."

This was by far the best show I have ever seen anywhere! The history behind this magnificent theater and the massive stage upon which the performance takes place is just part of the breathtaking ambience of visiting here. The sets are now digital, smooth and technologically ahead of anything anywhere. The Rockettes professionalism and talent never disappoints. Like anywhere you go these days you are frisked and searched at the door to get in, but that's the way we live these days and it is to be expected. If you have a chance to see anything in this historic hall, be sure to add it to your list of things to see and do in NYC!"

This is the 2nd year they've done this show and for a very limited time. It was an hour and a half, and it told a cute story, however, some of the show was quite boring and some parts creepy (when the animal statues talk...no thank you). The rockettes were spectacular as always, and the costumes were fabulous. You can get cheap tix. Great for a fun day in the city."

We met a Rockette! Seeing the theatre, how we wished we were there for a performance. There's a model of the stage that's very interesting and still in working order! This was my husband's favourite attraction while visiting New York City. Seeing this building restored to its 1932 glory is most impressive.

We did get to see a number of the non-public areas, but technically we did not get to see backstage. We did not see the famous hydraulic stage lifts - just a (non-working) model in the foyer. The meeting with a Rockett [their chorus line] was pleasant but very brief, and while the picture taken with her was good it was expensive, and not purchased.The guide obviously knew her script well and did her best, but this was a disappointment. I'd chosen a day when there was no show playing in hope that we would get to see more, as indicated in their publicity - my guess is that as there was a show resident we saw as little as on a show day. Such a contrast to my visit to TotR across the road earlier."

Anyway the landmark itself, the 'radio city' neon sign outside is interesting but as i go in i think the building is quite old and has this worn out feeling , in my opinion. I don't expect this from new york, i guess i just overreacted. But if you're in NYC i guess taking a picture around the area is a great idea since this is close to rockefeller and also fifth avenue, so it's a great deal to walk around and see the famous landmark."

Hold my wallet, keys, coins, tissues, throat drops, and stuff -- hold them all in my two hands and walk through the door? Yes, the security guard was very serious and not the least bit welcoming. It affected my enjoyment of the whole experience. The show claims to be \"spectacular,\" but there are many shows in town that are just as impressive (and most have a better storyline). Honestly, at my age, I've been to many, many shows all over the world; but I've never been to a music hall anywhere that treated its ticketholders this badly as they entered the door. Unfortunately, this kind of behavior tends to reflect badly even on New York City, which is the theme of the entire show."

Everything--the lighting, costumes, set design, music and creative design behind this valentine to New York City soothes the ragged soul.

We enjoyed getting to see part of a show from way up top in the balcony and seeing pictures of lots of people who have played there. The 2nd half of the tour seemed to be just about the rockettes--thier costumes, how many of them there are, etc. We got to meet one who wasn't performing and have pics taken with her to purchase later. Overall it was good but is not long enough to do again."

As the Hall is larger than most, I think sitting beyond the usual Orchestra range would benefit from 10-power binoculars. It looked to me like the first balcony was therefore further away than in the usual symphony hall, so consult the seating chart. Consider arriving 30-45 minutes early and shopping before the show, as the kiosk lines were lengthy after the show, with tourists hemming and hawing about their purchases, and lengthy payment procedures."

We were there for the Spectacular Rockettes show opening. Fantastic show. I was amazed at how efficient they were in the bathrooms. The line was super long but the stalls are numbered and they have a staff directing you to the numbered stall. Very efficient."

We have all seen the outside and maybe taken a picture. Trust me when I say this is well worth the tour as well. We toured using our NY passes which made it even better value. Great if it's raining. Very near to the 'Mona' Art Museum as well. All in all, if your in town for 3 or 4 days add this to your list of great things to check out."

They kept the opening number \"Welcome to NY\" after that it was all down hill. Two bratty kids stuck in NY. The girl was overly bratty. The plot was so disjointed and choppy. The Spring Show took years to develop. This show was put togather in 6 months and it was apparent. When I looked in the Playbill for the stars- there were none unlike last year. I have seen high school plays better than this. The loud music did not save the show. In fact, it was too loud. Why did they mess with Singing in the Rain- another disappointment. However, The Rockettes were fantastic as usual. The Rocketes deserve better than this plot. And let the Rockettes do what they do best- kick. Dont try to modernize them. They were the show. I would not waste the money on this show. Save your money for Christmas"

Even the ladies' room is a must see (check out the foot operated sinks). The show is 90 minutes long and the entire 90 minutes fills one with awe. The story is simple, but a way to see the major sites of NYC brought to you with amazing special effects. As someone born in Brooklyn who has visited the Music Hall many times, I found this show more enjoyable and exciting than even the Christmas show. Great for the entire family. A family with preschoolers sat in front of us and was mesmerized and sat entranced for the whole show. As seniors, my husband and I were just as entertained. The puppetry of the statues and the special effects of the scenes were amazing. And as always, the Rockettes were perfect. A wonderful experience for tourists and New Yorkers. Discount tickets can be obtained from many sources."

We got to meet one of the Rockettes (dancers) too and she was lovely and happy to answer questions. Only slight moan was that the tours are every 15 minutes and you can therefore wait for 15 minutes for the start of the next one. There is no seating in the 'holding area' and when we sat on the floor we were told we had to get up. There were some elderly people on the tour and this isn't ideal."

The show is perfectly-timed and perfectly entertaining to keep a 5-year-old and then 6-year-old engaged the whole time. The show does not change much year after year so perhaps seeing it once is sufficient. We liked it enough the first time to go back and see it a 2nd time the very next year and Im hopeful we'll go back again when he's older. Additional perk: the hot chocolate that goes for $6 is totally worth it especially if you save the mug! That mug has become my to-go-to mug for my coffee or tea!"

The hall itself it's lovely , the decor quaint and we'll laid out. The only thing was the price of drinks and sweets , 17 dollars for a cold drink and a box of popcorn was very steep , works out at around 12 pounds , but I guess it's a captive market , the concert was amazing and would love to return at some time in the future."

Many times when classic buildings are \"Restored\" they become ruined as modern architects try to leave their own fingerprints on the building rather than truly bringing back what was once there. That hasn't happened with Radio City. They truly turned the clock back and restored this beautiful theater to its former glory, somehow with no modern influences. Even the bathrooms still retain the 1930s hand dryers. Climate control, electrics, and sound systems are all modern, but hidden from sight. I still am amazed by this place every time I see a performance here. If you can do the backstage tour, go for it! The workings of the Radio City stage, even for a stagehand, are pretty unique. Also, if you can get a chance to hear the wonderful theater organ here, do it. In a city where progress usually means tear down something beautiful and replace it with a dull office building or ugly condominiums, Radio City stands defiantly, beautifully, defending its well-deserve turf."

(She was an actor and working as a tour guide was her 3rd job....info which added to the authenticity of New York! I had no idea of the history of Radio City and had heard vaguely of the Rockettes, but now feel as though I have missed out on something really big and important (had no idea Adele, Prince, Madonna etc etc etc played there) , and next time I go to New York, I will try and coincide it with a Radio City show. I did feel a bit sorry for the Rockette who had been made to dress up and meet us , as no one wanted to have their photo taken with her in front of a green screen (been there done that in so many other places!)Would recommend a visit."

When we arrived at our seat in the first mezzanine, my seat, section 4, row 2, seat 412 was broken. We bought these tickets last December as soon as the show was released because we wanted to sit in an area where we didn't have to stand because both of us suffer from arthritis. Being seasoned concert goers, we know the mezzanine is the place to go. I immediately called the usher that sat us, and she apologized and said she would resolve it. She came back and wanted to re-seat us higher up in the same section, but over to the left side. My husband declined because the view was not good. I sat in my husband's seat, while he sat on the floor. She returned, without telling us where she was taking us, and sat us in the extreme right of the hall, near the stage. As soon as the show started, everyone in our section stood up, and continued to stand through the second song. I went to the back and asked another usher to find her to move us back to the mezzanine. There was no one in the seats behind ours. Instead, a different, very sassy and rude employee came and started giving me a hard time saying that \"this is a concert, we can't make people sit! What if you move you back there and then someone stands?!\" I tried to explain to her why we bought those seats and she started shaking her finger at me and said, \"stop yelling and keep your hands away from my face!\" She was more interested in arguing with me that resolving the problem. I was yelling because the music was loud and it was already 20 minutes into the show, that we had been missing. We paid over $200, not to mention the train and subway trip. I was very frustrated and turned away from her because she was not at all demonstrating any level of customer service, she extremely rude. It took some time for the original usher to return. She took us back up to the seats behind ours (which no one came to sit in during the entire 2 1/2 hour show),took our tickets and never returned - we always save our tickets and this will be the ONE show which we don't have. The man next to us, attending with his two boys, said he originally told her that no one was sitting where we ending up, before she took us downstairs. He bought the mezzanine for the same reason! NO ONE stood in our section the entire time. After the aggravation and inconsiderate behavior we experienced, we will not be returning to this venue. If you pay that much for seats, you should be able to sit in them, they should not be broken! And if you inconvenience your customers, you should show some consideration and apologize. But, no one had thought of any of that at Radio City Music Hall. We were not treated well at all and will not be back."

We started our tour in the foyer, with its enormous chandeliers and murals on the wall alongside the staircase leading to the upper levels. The carpeting has a repeating pattern of musical instruments.We then moved to the backstage area, but below the large stage itself, to be explained how the stage is lowered and raised - a mechanical feat. We ascended to the upper level of the auditorium to see the splendor of the thousands of seats and the stage. The auditorium is built to represent the setting sun.The tour continued to the dressing rooms where the Rockettes are costumed, several times per performance with total efficiency. Seated in a conference room we saw a short movie of the history of the Rockettes and this was followed by us actually meeting a Rockette who, dressed in her stage costume, explained to us how they are chosen, trained, rehearsed etc.The above is not fully inclusive of the tour but merely the highlights.Our guide was very friendly and knowledgeable. A tour of this New York gem is highly recommended."

I sat in the front row of the first mezzanine (seat 611), and the view was great. Acoustically, RCMH is very impressive. The sound of the concert was great! In fact, the acoustics might be a little bit TOO good. Some people behind me were talking at a normal level during the concert, and I could hear them! The venue is nice, the seats were comfortable, and it's hard to believe that there is a bad seat in the house."

Getting into the show was pretty efficient and the wait was not too bad despite the long line. The RC staff were all pleasant and helpful."

The Rockettes stole the show, their dance routines were energetic and without fault. I loved the toy soldiers routine. The experience was well worth it.

It is amazing how the Rockettes are in perfect unison during the Parade of the Wooden Soldiers and, of course, their synchronized high kicks which they are known for. This show is for children and adults alike. The lobby is beautifully decorated for the season. If you are in NYC during the Christmas season, this is a show you cannot miss.

What an amazing example of art deco over the top glitz and glamour right out of the early 1930s. The Christmas show with the Rockettes is truly a sight you will never forget. Some of their choreography has remained exactly the same since it's opening performance in 1932. That is real history coming alive for you right along with the 2 massive pipe organs, the fabulous orchestra that rises up and out of the orchestra pit and a dazzling array of live camels, sheep and the entire cast in a fantastic Christmas tableau.

His knees hurt that night and next day because he was not able to stretch out.Thank goodness there was an elevator but, squishing my husband and his dog in a little space was not a very pleasant experience.We experienced very rude people while there. Not sure if its the Manhattan society or Radio City Music Hall patrons, but before the show, we purchased a few items and a drink and while attempting to get to the elevator people would not move for my husband. The worst was a very snody, wealthy women and her daughter standing in the middle of the lobby. The daughter was taking lots of selfies and I politely said \"Excuse me\" as to make way for my husband and service dog. She saw both of them, looked at me and so very rudely said \"NO\". I told her she was rude, went by her and went to the elevator. This was vefore our show. I could not believe what we started with, then our seats. More happened, but very trivial. We will never go back to see a show while in NY or advise family or friends that live there to go.Rockettes were great!!!"

Considering the amount of people exiting, the crowd moved smoothly. There wasn't any annoying elbow to elbow jams. The ushers and all staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable when we had questions about tickets, shows, seating, etc. Being a frequent concert go-er myself, I truly appreciated how fast they processed security checks at the entrance. Overall, we had a great time and loved Radio City. The history behind it made it a little extra special, too. We hope to come back to see the famous Christmas Spectacular.

Also, the Hall was beautiful, and I would like to come back for something else."

Nothing like it in the world! Fun for men, women, boys and girls\u2026.you should try to get seats close enough to feel like a part of it, but far enough back to see the precision and choreography.

We went this year on January 3rd and went right to the ticket counter for tickets. We got discount tickets in mezzanine which was fine and we all could see. However as I looked down into the orchestra it was totally emptyI have hard time with the fact that the entire first mezzanine was completely full and orchestra empty. Why could we not get tickets in the orchestra at discount prices if there were obviously 15-20 rows that could of been filled?Bad part on management.Putting that aside, you must see the Christmas show once in your lifetime."

The Rockettes are amazing, and the live Nativity - complete with camels and sheep - is beautiful.... and there's lots more. One great thing - there are multiple shows daily late-November thru early January, so it's easy to find a time that works. Radio City Music Hall also offers an interesting behind-the-scenes tour, particularly good when the grand stage is on the itinerary (ask - sometimes a specific show makes the stage off-limits) - and you can meet a Rockette. Pretty fun!"

The crowds were huge but in typical New York fashion orderly and good humoured. We had to queue for about 40 minutes in the freezing cold before being let in the doors and were subjected to a full security check. Not sure why we were made to throw out our water but suspect it had everything to do with profiteering so we could buy a bottle inside for upwards of $6,00 and little to do with actual security but maybe I am too cynical. The show was wonderful. Great singing and dancing. Was very surprised at the overtly religious tones towards the end for a country which enshews Merry Christmas in favour of the more secular Happy Holidays! Expensive but a must see at that time of year and a wonderful overall experience"

Never-the-less it was still a great experience - the beauty and glitz of the venue itself, and the magnificence of the production all held his interest, and filled me with warm, wonderful holiday feelings. And for those of you who enjoy photography, the RC Christmas marquee is spectacular, and I got some fantastic night shots of this old Music Hall from a block away, using no flash.

We had the cookies and hot chocolate which was a nice added touch. As we are not pro\u2019s at ice skating we did not glide as elegantly as others but we got the hang of it eventually. If you do go around the busy times, allow yourself extra times to get through the crowds."

We were glad we saw the Rockettes but we wished we had gotten better seats. If you are on a budget, get the discounted seats but if you have some extra cash, by all means and do yourself a favor and get better seats. The auditorium has such a great and terrible history so you don\u2019t want to miss it.

The Dance numbers were to be sure well executed but except for two (The New York City Tour and the March of the Wooden Soldiers)Disappointing.Most Distressing was the behavior of the Audience and their Use by all too many to Use their I Pads and phones to Record the Performance and in the process blocking the view of patrons behind them.This was indeed one of My most Disappointing Experiences In New York City"

Overall, this was one of my favourite \"broadway\" productions and I would recommend it to anyone travelling to New York, especially during christmas."

Was in the 1st Mezz, 2nd from the last row, but the view is still great. Though for the some of the rockettes act it would be great to be more centrally located and a bit lower.Only negatives was that the souvenirs are expensive and the magnet purchased was not magnetic at all.And that they keep letting folks in at all times that does take away from the viewing experience as they are being seated. To avoid that you can be seated as close to the stage or level start as possible and also somewhere in the middle seats of the row."

Knowing they do 5 shows a day, we were prepared for the herding in & out of the theater. That doesn't give one much time to take in the beauty of the Music Hall. The show itself lasts about 1:15, with the expected Christmas tunes and Rockette dances. To get in, line forms on W. 50th Street & quickly extends back almost to 5th Avenue. At some point, they start directing those in the back of the line to the 51st St entrance."

We went to watch on Christmas Day & it was so festive! There was something for all ages too! We were sat in Row A in the Orchestra/Stalls from seats 214 - We were unsure about these seats when we booked them, having never been to Radio City before but they were perfect to be honest. They are slightly off to the side but it doesn't make any difference to the viewing and I would sit there again, no problem.Anyone in NYC over the Christmas period MUST go and see this show.

Their dancing was flawless and the music was better than I expected. The auditorium is HUGE and we were way up, and way in the back. I think I would have enjoyed the show more had we had even mediocre seats. The other negatives were 1.) the ridiculously high priced souvenirs (I'm used to over-priced, but I found these prices nearly offensive) and 2.) the search of coats and bags upon entry to the building. I'm a Kansas girl, so I guess I'm just not used to being patted down, but at the same time, we saw two other shows (Hamilton and Phantom) and did not receive the same search. I understand it is their building and if I don't like it, I don't have to see their show. Of course, I did not know before I went that the search would occur.As for the positives, as stated above, the dancing was really good. The singing was great. It is a family atmosphere appropriate for even little ones. Since many of the broadway shows are not kid-friendly, this is a welcome production in NYC. Finally, the live nativity was spectacular."

After years of living close we finally decided to see the Christmas Spectacular. The show was fun but this review is for the venue (we've been before for a Kevin Smith movie showing). It's cool and has a historic edge ... Albeit the that edge is a little worn. Very little incline between the rows and seats not staggered so if you're short (like me) try to get an aisle seat so you can at least lean your seat out. Besides that like most other theaters but worth the visit for Christmas."

There was no system to let people in, so the crowd just starting pushing through the lines. If you have a chance to visit and see a show, just make sure you're in line early so you don't have to fight the crowds.They had plenty of bars to order snacks like candy, chips and popcorn, as well as a decent bar for drinks. Prices are similar to any other event in NYC, but nothing outrageous. Regular mixed drinks and wine were about $12-15. Popcorn came in two sizes - small for $9 and large for around $12-14. Drinks and popcorn came in souvenir containers.Other than that, the hall is beautiful and the show was good. The Christmas Spectacular is more for children than adults, but it was still great to see once. We sat in the orchestra section to the left of the stage in the fourth row from the stage. Tickets in this area are expensive $140 and up for this specific show. It was great to be so close to the stage and orchestra, but it's hard to get the entire stage in your pictures. I would pay to sit in this section again, but would prefer to be in the center section. "

The public spaces are sumptuous, from the elevators to the restrooms. Seriously, the men's room on the Second Mezzanine had a lounge area in which you were tempted to linger. If you want to experience what a great theatre used to be, you must visit.The Christmas show was even more professional and impressive than I expected. The whole experience would be wonderful for families, but even adult couples would be entertained by the talent and discipline of the Rockettes. One of the best stage shows I have seen."

Unfortunately up to 45 minutes into the show ushers were still showing people to their seats which was quite annoying when you were seated behind these groups of people and your view was blocked whilst trying to enjoy the show. Perhaps this theatre should be like other theatres and close the door at the time the show starts. It was a great Christmas experience for our family. Rockettes were great and choreography superb."

The Christmas Spectacular is not cheap for 16 tickets, but it brought lots of smiles and brought back lots of memories. A couple of things- follow the directions on printing/downloading/picking up tickets. Don't assume that you will be allowed in without a printed ticket. Enter at the 51st Street entrance. Go to the bathroom before the show if you are female - the line will be huge afterwards. Plan parking. We went to a Saturday 11am show and parked just a block and a half away.

We had a couple in front of us who must have thought they were at a Yankees game. Hot dogs, popcorn, pretzels, m&m's and they even had a mustard bottle. They were eating and talking most of the time. We noticed that there was a lot of chatter throughout the whole show. Many people came in very late and many adults were in and out during the show, both of which was distracting.Like other Broadway shows, we wish Radio City would close the doors at the opening of the show (and potentially have a better system of getting people in the doors to begin with) and to not allow food during the show.

Wouldn't go every year, but if you've never been or haven't been in several years it's really worth seeing. Makes you tap your feet and want to sign along!"

The costumes, the choreography, the songs, the lighting and special effects.... it was just breathtaking. I would go again, and I think it would make a great Christmas tradition for everyone. If I never get to make it there again, I will always remember and cherish our trip to the Radio City Music Hall! Just wonderful!"

As a young child, I remember my parents trying to get tickets for the family but they were sold out. I ordered my tickets about a month ahead of my trip to NYC. Even a full month ahead our seats were in the back. The place itself is a wonder with its ornate decor. The Rockets live up to their great reputation; however, my absolute favorite part of the show is the finale with the live camels and other animals supporting the nativity scene. It truly is a Christmas show. The one small drawback is the crowd. This is a very popular show and many people line up long before the doors open. In addition, the commercial part which sells every type of souvenir. It is a distraction from a wonderful show."

Our last visit was 4 years ago and wasn't really certain if we wanted to see another show for fear of having a repeat. Such was not the case, the show was much different but the message the same- Christmas is joyful !! What a wonderful show and our suggestion would be to reserve your seats early; best section of seats is the orchestra section (Orchestra 4) at least 12-15 rows from stage. Definitely do not want to be real close to the stage !! I'd also suggest forgoing the popcorn & soda....... no cup holder for cups of soda + is not your typical theater prices !! Save your money and snack afterward. Show is only 90 minutes but goes by quickly. You'll definitely depart with a warm, fuzzy feeling. WE LOVED IT and ready to go again"

The 3-D glasses they handed out made the 3-D effect just perfect - Santa's sleigh was speeding through the skyscrapers of the New York City skyline and presents were flying out of his sleigh and it appeared that you could reach out and grab them. It is a must if you are going to New York in December. This show was approximately 90 minutes with no breaks. Your bags are checked before you go in and your are wanded by security at the entrance. They are serious about being on time, doors shut and the orchestra starts the show, so allow yourself enough time to get there and get in, because NYC at Christmas time is very busy and crowded."

From our first step in Radio City, it was obvious this was historical and revered for a reason. It was really like going back in time to the 1920s, as everything was opulent and impressive. The theater was huge and the show was simply incredible. The precision of the dancers still confounds me, and the AV effects added a modern twist to a show that has not changed much in decades. They even had a 3D movie! Will definitely return and will strongly recommend that my friends take their wives!"

Anything early that day was a blessing because it was 34 degrees outside. The staff in this venue was also working double shifts and they we still in great spirits.

There are backstage tours available which we would like to do next time.

In fact, I was a little nervous that the people behind me were going to get in a fight with a couple who had cut in front of about 100 people. This is the line for people WITH tickets, so I can't even imagine what it would be like if you were trying to purchase tickets. The other thing and the main thing that REALLY bothered me was they never held the latecomers. We had aisle seats and for a good 30 minutes after the show started they were still letting in late people who walked in front of all of us who arrived on time. It was super annoying considering the price we paid for the tickets. They didn't even make them wait to find their seats between acts."

It's full on synchronised dancing with up to 40 odd dancers on the stage at any one time.There are two pipe organs one either side of the stage concealed by curtains which pull back to allow the players to moved out towards the audience to warm them up before the show kicks off.It is a little bit American cheesy, but we are in NYC after all.The dancers are incredibly skilled and the sequence in the current show with the dancers dressed as toy soldiers is almost unbelievably perfect in execution and breathtaking.I don't really like song and dance shows, but I would recommend Radio City Music Hall to anyone.I also don't think you need to buy expensive tickets, I bought the cheapest at about $40 each and had a great unrestricted view in the gods and can't really think of a reason to shell out $100 or more for the top price tickets.A sight to see that I think you are only going to see here in NYC.A great visual treat that smaller children would just lap up.This is also a brilliant option for a show if English is not your mother tongue."

The objective of our trip is to celebrate our daughter's efforts in school, which has been a big challenge for her. With that said I bought front row tickets to the Christmas Spectacular show at 9:30. I planned to take a picture of her at the show, before the show, and periodically remind her with a picture what she accomplished and what the reward was. Yesterday we flew from Houston to NY, caught a taxi to the hotel, went to dinner and the show. When we got there one of the security guards confronted me to say I could not bring my camera to the show. I was openly holding a Nikon Digital camera with a 50mm lens. According to him it was a \"professional camera\". I was surprised because when we go to Texan games at NRG stadium they have spelled out a professional camera to be one with a lens longer than 12 inches, where mine was less than 3. I was then given the option to either see the show without a camera or leave. I was then told I could purchase a picture with one of the Rockettes. The hotel we staying at had a similar view even going further to say no telephoto or zoom lens, which it is not.This experience left a horrible taste in my mouth especially when someone sitting relatively close to us filmed a fair amount of the show and then told me I should have hidden my camera until I got to the metal screening. I wish we would have spent our time and money elsewhere and I would have given a lower score if I possible."

The Art-deco style of the building remains unchanged, giving it that old classy feel. Walk into the bathrooms and it feels like walking back in time. They include an area for women to fix their makeup, and another area for lounging. It was quite interesting. The Christmas show was fantastic, from the high kicking Rockettes, to the Nutcracker performance, to Santa flying around NYC. I did see the show about 5 years ago, and it was the same show now as it was then. Tradition is good, but some variety would be nice.Definitely a must-see."

When we got there the only obstruction was for a few minutes when the orchestra was elevated on the stage and we couldn't see any of them except the few closest to us. But that lasted a few minutes and the rest of the show our seats were excellent. Check out the bathrooms on the first floor they are huge and so unique. The lobby was beautiful. We got in line about 30 minutes before showtime and spent maybe 5 minutes to get in. They obviously know how to move the clouds in efficiently. This was well worth the money."

Outstanding in every way. Great family fun. Certainly puts you in the Christmas spirit. Delighted to see the Christmas theme told without any holding back. There was an interesting \"under theme\" too that was encouraging. On stage, a couple times, there was a Salvation Army red kettle for Xmas fundraising prominently shown, but never mentioned. And in one of the scenes, a young boy is seen depositing money into the kettle. Very nice. The Spirit of Christmas. The shows are expensive, but well worth it."

My only problem was the show was too expensive. I don't think it was worth the asking price but good thing I found very cheap tickets for 4 on Groupon which cost the total amount of the asking price per person. Another thing is it was scheduled very late in the evening, (10 pm) where taking the train was a preferable option. We had to drive there because the train stops running around 10pm, then we had to find a parking which cost an additional $40+, pay a $14 toll, and walked all over the place to kill time while we waited for the show to begin. Other than all the hassle, the show was awesome."

I had not been there for more than 20 years, and though there are now laser lights, and 3-D glasses, the \"feeling\" of Christmas is still the same. My adult daughter and I loved it! First of all, being in NYC at Christmas time is a wonderful experience in itself. All the beautiful decorations, the Rockefeller Center tree, Times Square all lit up, is beautiful. Radio City Music Hall is an iconic building, just gorgeous with all its splendor, chandeliers, soaring ceilings, lush carpeting. The show was beautiful from start to finish! The orchestra was fabulous, rising up out of the pit and playing Christmas carols. Santa, with his booming voice, and the children who sang and danced, were wonderful. There were awesome special effects with laser light, a time for the 3-D glasses, where snowballs came flying at you, and Santas sleigh flew around the world. Best of all was the world-famous dancing precision Rockettes who were involved in numerous musical extravaganza productions - they were wonderful, particularly in the Tin Soldiers number that they have been doing for years. Lastly, the touching live Nativity, with the three kings, live camels and donkeys, Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus. This was a five star production, and I hope to take my grandchildren next year. Tickets are pricey, ours were $75 and we were in the third mezzanine, and of course there are programs, and souvenirs, and food to buy, but it's a fabulous experience and I'd recommend it for anyone of any age who loves Christmas."

The venue, costumes, the dancers, the music (especially the twin pipe organists) made for a fast and energetic 90 minutes. The precision of the choreography is astonishing. We were in the second row but I wish we were farther back to take in more of the big picture. Santa's 3D experience is a fun touch, as are the streamers they shoot from the right side as you look at the stage. The ice skaters were also incredible in their one brief number.

The stage technology, once a wartime secret, meeting a Rockette-WOW, how shows are handled and all the other details of the production are explained. There are additional points of interest in the timing and construction of the Center, all worthwhile. At our visit we saw Ms Hudson rehearse for the Tony awards. The time slot below did not permit us to enter the real date."

It is a traditional rendition of the Christmas story along with a hearty Santa Claus story interwoven into the production. If you are looking for a non Christian rendition or a Politically Correct 'holiday show', then you are in the wrong place. The Rockettes were awesome, the choreography and costumes were wonderful, and the orchestration put you right into the holiday spirit. There is even a 3D number where Santa is flying around NYC. Make sure you get your 3D glasses before you are seated.The only knock on the entire experience was the line to get into the venue. Allow about an hour if you want to get into the theater with time to get a beverage and a snack. We barely made it in there before the show started. They had us line-up along the side of the building, and it stretched down the street and across the side access to Rockefeller Center. Plenty of opportunity for people to cut into the line as it wasn't clear where it ended and how many lanes wide it was to enter. The event staff were kind and tried to keep things orderly, but once it got close to showtime the patrons weren't interested in getting on the back of the line. This being NYC, I wouldn't be surprised if tensions rise and patience is tested. Once you get past security checks, then your frustration shifts to enjoying the show.This is one of those shows where you know the story doesn't change, but it just puts you in a Great Christmas spirit. I could definitely see how this can become a family tradition, and one where the kids would be totally entertained. Merry Christmas!"

There is good variety in the music and the show. The Rockettes dance multiple times, they have an ice skating rink for 1 number, there are live animals-camel, donkey, sheep. They had 3 d glasses for the number where Santa takes off for New York and it makes the sleigh come out into the crowd which was fun. Look for ticket specials online, at Travelzoo and if you are in NYC and around Rockefeller Center they may have staff handing out coupons. We got our tickets about 2 weeks in advance via Travelzoo for about 50% of website prices. They also offer ticket specials online very close to show time as they want to fill the seats. Earlier shows are usually cheaper and have more seats they want to fill and are often discounted close to showtime.You line up outside for the show so be prepared to wait for entry. They recommend arriving an hour before and it is a good idea. They come through the outside lines and scan tickets but they do search bags at the door so it takes a while to get in. They have concessions upstairs and down and it is mostly geared toward children with lots of candy. As usual the women's restrooms have long lines and you need to allow waiting time ( 15-20 minutes). They also offer some fun toys for the kids as take aways so just be prepared. You are directly across from Rockefeller Center which offers subway access and lots of food and shopping choices. We came by subway so I cannot address area parking."

The following Disneyesque production consisted of dancing Santa's, Rag Doll's and a spectacular Toy Soldier routine by The Rockettes. Not missing the true message of Christmas the show ended with a not too long nativity piece with real camels, sheep and a donkey. Dare I say that I left the theater into the bright lights of Rockefeller plaza with a slight Xmas glow about me.The theatre is large and well managed and all the staff were friendly and very helpful."

People used flash, the held up their phones, they didnt silence them and one woman took a call in her seat with an usher right there. Its disruptive as can be and needs to be addressed"

Everything about this show is truly spectacular; from the orchestra to the wonderful choreographed Rockettes to the beautiful costumes. Not to mention the beauty of Radio City Music Hall. The show flows seamlessly from one scene to the next. It always amazes me how quickly the Rockettes can change customers (and there a lot of changes). My favorite scene is The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers. Just love how they all fall on each other at the end of the scene. Also love the 3-D effect in the beginning of the show and how they incorporate the true meaning of Christmas. Of course Santa makes a visit. The 90 minute show (no intermission) goes by rather quickly. A must see!!"

I couldn't have been more wrong! The state-of-the-art 3D beginning was breathtaking and the effects onstage were only beaten by the eye- popping, perfect dance routines. I'd rather not use the old 'a show not to be missed' comment but this is exactly that! This show appeals to any age group and will not disappoint. The scale of Radio City Music Hall is vast and, to give some indication of seating, we were on seats ORCH4 D401 and 402 giving a superb central, unobstructed view of the action, some distance in front of the balcony overhang above."

The guida called Naomi was excellent, the history was very interesting, the art deco was fantastic. Got to meet a Rockette (I had never heard of such a thing before) and was amazed to see what the competition was to secure a place (400 applicants for 4 jobs). The skill of the dancers is truly spectacular and the show was really great. Even if you don't like musicals (like me) treat yourself to the show and you will not regret it. However, I was upset at how badly behaved the audience was. People arriving 30 mins late for the show and still being allowed admittance. People talking all the way through, folks seemingly more interested in feeding their stomachs than paying attention. The orchestra was superb, I thought the organists were a little heavy on special effects and low on playing anything of real difficulty. I suspect they are as high quality as everyone else and were just told to play such awful music by the management"

I knew very little about Radio City which seems to be very special to New Yorkers and very much a part of their holiday tradition. We visited it during their Holiday Show and nearly turned away due to the vast crowd but we didn't have to join their queues. We were intoduced to the venue by Tabitha who enthusiastically gave us the history of Radio City. There was also a short film in very comfortable, original seats and a look at the rooms where the 'stars' hold their after awards parties. The highlight was to meet a real Rockette who is a dancer who had wanted to join the cast since she had visited as a child! We had our photograph taken with her too as a keepsake. It was a special time to visit due to the Christmas Show as the crystal tree chandelier and decor were stunning. Well done New Yorkers for saving Radio City - we really enjoyed our visit and the staff were really great."

Especially the lower level where people pay extra for good seats. Ushers did nothing about sitting people down or telling people not to block isles! Buy middle seats because anything on the sides suck! If ushers would just do their jobs and wait for a break in the performance to send people down it would make it a little more classy and enjoyable!

The script, stage, props and theatrics were amazing right down to the ushers. The Rockettes take such pride in their accomplishments, as they should. Their costumes, routines and facial expressions are the epitome of perfect. The old world charm of glam transports you back to the 1930's yet the modern twists will make your heart swell. From drones and animals to lighting and special effects, young and old will be mesmerized! Tips: Get on the e-mail list and buy your tickets in the summer when it is B1G1. It was a better price and seats than the groupon deal.When you pick your seats sit on the right hand side, when you are looking at the stage. They shoot streamers and snow from that side and it makes it more spectacular. Like up early on the side of the building and you can get in to get settled before the mob of people hit.Don't bring any drink. They don't allow it if its opened. They use a wand to check for illegal things and always check your bags. Be alert and ready to cooperate to make the lines move faster."

However I would also stress ... that you plan on sitting your children on your lap as the layout of the seats will block their view if there is an adult sitting in front of them. I would also like to add that the current ticket pricing is sadly going to eliminate many families as it is no longer affordable. The concession stand pricing is also outrageous ...$ 5.50 for a bottle of water . I am prepared to pay what ever I have to...my thoughts are for some who might miss this experience due to corporate greed."

If you are in NYC over the holiday's try and see this show, I wish I could again!"

We had seats in the last 2 rows of the first mezzanine and while we could see our pictures didn't really come out all that great. You are prohibited from recording or using flash photography. There are no columns holding up the tiers so technically there's not a bad seat in the house. The show itself is fabulous and I loved the young ballerina for the nutcracker part and the precision of the Rockettes just has to be witnessed to be appreciated. Just amazing! Maybe not a yearly visit for us but certainly every few years."

The Rockettes do so many dazzling numbers and the costumes are exceptionally gorgeous. There were many kids at the performance we attended and the how totally held their attention. The way they use 3 D glasses, the use of the whole area including the ceiling is quite remarkable. The Christmas Story tells the Christmas story in a very beautiful way. Would never miss the show if we are back in NYC at Christmas."

The reception hall is very grand and although there are signs everywhere saying 'no photography' in the foyer you are constantly bumping into people as they stop to take a picture of the huge chandelier. I was amazed by the whole experience and will defiantly book to go back when I return to NYC"

I love the 3D and the floating snowballs. It still has all of the elements I remember, toy soldiers, NYC snow scenes and my favorite the living Nativity that keep it wonderful but they keep somehow improving it every time.

We brought friends and our 6yr old and we all found moments that we loved. Everyone's favourite is the closing with the Navity scene but I also really enjoy the multitude of Santa's and the Toy soldiers set. The addition of the 3d is fun. Olivia was busy trying to touch things that seemed to come out at her. The seats and the theatre are very comfortable. I wish that I had the same seat at the Broadway show I went to the day before. The space is very roomy and there doesn't seem to be a bad seat in the house. We took mezzanine level on the very righthand side. It was very reasonably priced and as I said we had wonderful sightlines and very comfortable seats."

I got my tickets from Groupon and my seats were in the Mezzanine. I was able to see everything. The show started ON TIME! I came to see the Christmas Spectacular with the Rockettes. They were GREAT! Their costumes were nice and the props were awesome. Cons- The only problem were that the ticket agents seemed new and didn't know what to do with our Groupon tickets. And many of the people on line behind me had the groupon tickets as well so we had to wait till they found a manager to sort it out. Other than that hiccup, it the night went smoothly.The show is definitely worth coming to NYC to see. From the 3-D effects to the songs and the dancing. It was truly a great adventure to see it. They have Santa downstairs to take pictures and cotton candy upstairs. They have a bar to sell drinks and booths to purchase photos as well as other souvenirs.The bathrooms are old-fashion and there was a long line for both male and female bathroom. I would not mind coming back here for another show. I definitely recommend if you are in NYC, to come see the Rockettes, you will not be disappointed."

Also lovely is the Nativity scene at the end complete with the kings and camels. Enchanting for young and old - make it a part of your tradition.

Pitched up at the relevant desk and were told by the lady attendent that 'we don't accept those any more'. Plenty of other things to do, so didn't argue the toss. But checked on line when we got back to our hotel, and the Radio City stage door tour was clearly advertised as an option with the NY Explorer Pass on both the Radio City & Smart Destinations websites. So either the web sites need updating or the staff need training. Either way, not impressed."

I missed the Santa Dance behind the curtains. The couples hsopping i NYC is replaced by a trimmed down version - not as colorful. Then they added some kids looking for a gift for his sister with Santa. Kid actors are just annoying. Bring back more high kicks. More colors. More NYC."

It was fantastic and was everything I hoped it would be. I could have gone straight back in to watch it again.My big disappointment was that I bought the DVD in the foyer after the show and looked forward to showing my family the magical show.Unfortunately the DVD is not compatible on our systems BUT it does play on the computer. The BIG DISAPPOINTMENT was that the DVD purchased for $25 is from 2007 ! not the show I saw, although very nice I preferred the show I watched."

            "review": "A Christmas Must See!. Many years ago, I lived in New York and would see the Christmas show on occasion. It's been over thirty years since I went to Radio City Music Hall, and I have to tell you, it's not your grandaddy's (or even your daddy's) Christmas show any more. It truly is fantastic! It's an hour and a half of non-stop music, dancing, and Santa, with some 3-D thrown in and very clever movement on stage with impressive backdrops. Of course, the Rockettes are in almost every sequence of the show, and they're as great as ever. And yes, the show ends with a nativity sequence and a few live animals, just as in the past.When I went as a kid and very young man, the price was quite different from today, so expect to spend upwards of $60 to over $100 if you want Orchestra seats. Honestly, if you can afford it, treat yourself and get up close n the orchestra. I was in the back of the Orchestra seating (Row T), and while I saw quite well, I would've enjoyed being closer. I think up front in the Mezzanine would even be better seating than the back of the Orchestra.If you're visiting the city for the first time, I hope you're staying at a hotel so you can walk or take public transportation to the show. You DON'T want to drive in the city!While you're there, be sure to visit Rockefeller Center where you can see the tree, always a sight to behold, and visit in the building where there are tours, shops and places to eat galore. In addition, NBC Studio is right near by if you have the time for a tour, or even a show.As long as you can handle the crowds and rush, rush of the city, this is a great treat this time of year, whether you're visiting or live there."

Also you get the usual free playbill program but also a Christmas hat (great idea as the show logo and main sponsor is on it) now to get anything free is a bonus nowadays. The show is a mix of traditional song and dance routines dating back to the thirties and some with a clever mix of new technology including a great 3D film to follow Santa to the famous music hall and some drone snowflakes that hover feet from your head. But the star or stars of this show is of course the rocketts who come on all the way and give you stunning routines that are so perfect that you hear gasps throughout the show from the audience. Special mention to the soldiers dance. Where very slowly they line up within inches of each other and very slowly fall over into the next like dominoes. This show I believe should be scene at least once in your life."

Decided to see the Christmas Spectacular this year after hearing about the many current and relevant technological enhancements to the show.It was amazing, entertaining, and had everything you can imagine and surprises (won't spoil it for you)! The music, scenery, costumes - all fantastic and eye pleasing. The Rockettes are truly a class act. The Music Hall is as grand as I had remembered it. Whether you're a local or a visitor to New York City, take you and your family to see this show. There are many different discounted tickets available; we had tickets that were $44 each for center orchestra and were perfect, well worth it seats. The show is about 1 1/2 hours and just the right length for young children. Try to go this holiday season!"

When we were allowed in the theater the magic began. Two huge organs played a prelude that lasted about 10 minutes that was unbelievable. The show itself was amazing. Everything was perfect - costumes, scenery, music, the precision of the Rockettes. Our seats were very good and the show kept everyone in our party, small children as well, entertained for the entire 90 minutes. It was also exciting to see the Living Nativity. I agree with others though, it would have been wonderful if it had lasted a little longer."

Of course, expect meticulous and jaw-dropping dancing from the Rockettes - they cannot fail to astound , and wonderful music; but also surprisingly this show has a real heart and emotional substance - including a moving and stirring telling of the story of the nativity. It is not all commercial glitz - this show has a soul too."

Opened in 1932 and built during the great depression along with Rockefeller Center Radio City was the premiere theatre in the USA as well as the world. In 83 years it had it shares of ups and downs. For the most part up until 1973 it was a first run single screen premiere movie theatre. In addition there was the annual Easter and Christmas Spectaculars. in 1973 it hit a down moment in it's history when management decided to book live concerts and some other shows and has been running that way since. RCMH seats 6200 people which makes it better to see a concert than going to an arena and larger than the 2000 seat plus theatres.One of the nice features is the Mighty Wurlitzer pipe organ. The low notes will knock your socks off. It has 2 keyboard consoles which can be play from either side or both at the same time. RCMH is owned by Cablevison of NY which also owns Madison Sq Garden along with the NY Knicks & NY Rangers as well as Beacon Theatre on W 74th and Bway that recently underwent a $16 million dollar renovation. RCMH is a can't miss. You'll love it. The tour will take you in to places that is not available to the general public"

They're an impressive group of dancers in great costumes even if you can see the tape on the stage for their marks. During their wardrobe changes you are entertained by some other talented dancers but also by cheesy videos including many reminders that the show is sponsored by certain companies, unimpressive acting, and a weak story. Of course there were also camels and some sheep. I think I would have preferred this performance fifty years ago before the videos and 3D movies made it less about the dancing."

Every aspect of the show was amazing from the initial dance scene to the final scenes of the nativity. It was great to see live sheep, a donkey and three camels. The Rockettes were amazing. The scene of the marching toy soldiers was a work of art.I could go on and on. Go see the show, it's worth the money and you don't have to pay top dollar to enjoy.

You can get tickets to the shows at discounted prices if you look, which you should definitely do, because once you walk inside, you'll be bleeding money. The show book, the Rockette picture, the food, the drinks, the snacks, all ridiculously overpriced. If you don't live in NYC, then it might be worth buying all that stuff...but for native NYers (like me) the prices are crazy. Good experience for young children. We go every other year because the shows don't change that much from year to year. Many families make it an annual tradition, but there are other things to do in the city so every other year is enough."

The show itself is absolutely amazing and if you a are not in Christmas spirit yet: believe me- you will be after the show. It is a must see. I would have given 5 stars if not for 2 things. Basically I'll give the show 5 stars, security a straight F and the photographer staff 1 star. My daughter wanted to take a picture with one of the Rockettes after the show. We approached the photographer staff and asked for the price of the picture. The staff member just gave us a eerie smile and said: it depends on the package you buy. I asked her how much it would cost for a single photograph with the Rockette dancer. Again: Depends what package you buy. Excuse me??? If you would like my business you better give me a price... we left ... because since no one seemed like giving us an answer... The security is more then lousy. A staff member at the door pokes into your bag or purse with a stick without checking the contents and waves you on. The lady that \"checked\" my bag didn't even look into it - she just told me: \"you are good\" By the door they scan the people but again not the bags... With all the terrorism going on: God forbid- but it would be way too easy to bring something in if someone would be for real! My advise to the management: It is not always only about the numbers and the money.. Hire better security staff. The music hall is a \"soft target\" and should be a lot safer!!"

My sister had tickets through Groupon and we were in Orchestra 2 for the 10pm Saturday night show. Dancing was great. Singing was great. There was pretty tight security. A bomb sniffing dog, 2 bag checkers and a metal detector but I was impressed by how quickly they got people in. People were complaining but its NYC, the week after a major terrorist attack in a big city and before the Thanksgiving Day parade. Better safe than sorry. No drinks can be brought in but available to purchase inside. Santa was downstairs by the rest room. The bathroom was clean and the restroom worker made sure that the line moved quickly and people know which stall to use. Do use the bathroom before hand because there is no intermission. For those with Sensory issues, the dancers and Santas DO come out in the middle of the show so if you are in Orchestra 1 or the first 10 rows of Orchestra 2, they will be close. If my daughter had been there, she would have ran away (scared of Santa). The lady in front of me almost hurt herself trying to run away. Show was great for my sister and I, great for families and even would be a fun date. My favorite was the living nativity scene. So nice to remember the Christ in Christmas and beautifully done."

Three adults ventured forth with a Living Social coupon; we were way back in the next to the last row, but the space is made for spectacle, from the booming bass of the twin giant organs to the dancers on the side balconies. The computer generated images are enhanced with 3D glasses in the second number as Santa's sleigh swoops through the skyscrapers of New York. But the precision and costuming of the Rockette dancers were awesome, especially in the mechanical soldiers routine. The Nativity scene is near the end so the show covers both the Santa/gifts and religious aspects of Christmas. Go once and enjoy the show, as people have done for decades, although it's always new and improved! (It actually is a little long for children under 7 who may get restless.)"

Iconic in every way, this place was like a page from the past.... original light fixtures, Art Deco furnishings and design, and seating for over six thousand! You would never guess the grandeur of the place from the outside, as it sits across from Rockefeller Centre and NBC Studios. Opened in 1932, the place was supposed to offer high class variety entertainment. The Rockettes are synonymous with the theatre. As part of our tour, a Rockette gave our group a personal interview.The theatre itself is built in a shell type of shape meant to resemble the setting sun. The seats have been redone, but they look like the original style of the 30's. Most interesting were the bathroom fixtures, including a hand dryer that required a pedal be pushed for it to operate. Included in the tour was a guest book signed by famous names of the 40's and 50's, including Woody Woodpecker!. There were several nude sculptures cast in aluminum that adorned the hallways... not to my liking, but something that I am sure has artistic merit and historical value. Most interesting were the unseen workings of the moving stage that used state-of-the-art hydraulics similar to those used in aircraft carriers.We'll have to return for a show!"

We arrived early and sat down, I'm not sure what caused it but the performance started and half the seats were empty. We missed watching nearly the first 4 songs\\performances as people were in the aisles being seated blocked our views. Once we did get to start watching it was amazing and I would recommend it. Just such a shame as we may never get to see it again travelling as we did from the UK - oh well, that's the way the cookie crumbles"

I am not going to the show and I just want to buy tickets. This is absolutely unreasonable. I went back in 10 minutes and I wanted to pick them up in the trash can, the security guards still stopped me. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there.

At 90 minutes (no intermission) it is long enough to entertain and short enough to keep from being bored (although we all agreed that the story line with the 2 boys and going to the North Pole was the slow part of the show). Our favorites were Christmas in New York and the Toy Soldiers. The seats are amazing...so big and comfortable with lots of leg room. Yes, it is expensive, but well worth the money."

We were glad we arrived early enough to take in a little of the grandeur of this beautiful venue. The scale of this building is impressive. The show is fun, inspiring, superbly crafted and of course the execution is impeccable. The inclusion of a skating piece was a pleasantly unexpected! The interweaving of the traditions of Christmas, both sacred and secular was well done. My review would be an excellent except that there was absolutely no attempt to control some audience members' insatiable desire to photograph and video huge portions of the show. Needless to say the glaring of phone and tablet screens was very distracting. Please leave them in your pockets and actually enjoy the show!"

As someone who has a serious appreciation for architecture and design\u2013 I have to say, the interior of the Radio City Music Hall is a visual delight of architectural wonder. While retaining the regal and classic look of an older time period, the space still captures the grandness and scale that surprised, shocked, enamored all those who lived in the old days. I'm referring to a scale and magic that would melt even the most modern viewer. When it's showtime, the architecture of the space surrounds you and it really has you focusing on the stage. The lights, the sound\u2013 everything is so nice. It's such a delight being in that space."

Our guide was so full of interesting information & we could imagine each show so clearly that she gave us stories about. The building itself is truly stunning & majestic & a complete maze of corridors, stairs & rooms. So many famous people have performed here & we were honoured to actually walk on the stage, apparently only 1% of visitors get to do that. We got to meet a Rockette & learned so much about them. Would love to go back & actually see a show there. Check out the 'ladies' as they are out of this world. The most beautiful art deco place I've ever seen. A definite must if you are in New York."

It was about 20 $ a piece for seniors. A bit expensive considering hat we had to shell out another about 20 $ plus for a photograph with one of the Rocketeers, Shelby in her gorgeous costume, as a souvenir. However, as an Engineer, I was particularly impressed by the engineering expertise which went into the hydraulics of stage movement, with 6 columns which could be lifted by the force of hydraulic pressure. Considering that it was conceived in the 1930's, it is indded a remarkable engineering feat. Also, was highly impressed at the thoughtfulness of the architect, who wanted everyone to enjoy the experience, that he gave even the last seat holder ample leg room. Wish our economy airlines, can take a hint from this."

If you're VERY lucky you might even get to see the FABULOUS duplex apartment that's in there...somewhere. Ever wonder where they keep the animals that are in the Christmas Spectacular? Or how deep does it go when the orchestra slowly drops down out of sight? Where do the pipes from those pipe organs pipe to? And why does the men's room have a waiting room/lounge area in it that's four times as big as my whole apartment? Get the answer to these and other questions you didn't know you couldn't live without knowing the answers to during the tour. Oh...and...meet a real live Rocket!"

The stage is styled like it has a setting sun behind it. When it opened 80-odd years ago, it was a 6,000-seat movie theater - which was the largest in the world at that time. The acoustics in here are terrific. Yes, this is a part of the sprawling Rockefeller Center complex."

Any seat in the theater will give you a decent view of the huge stage and performers. Overall, a few things to note are that you will be crowded in the main lobby when you walk in and food is expensive. They have some novelty items that you can buy, and if you are lucky you will be there to get a picture with a Rockette before they go on stage. Great experience that I could go back to time and time again."

Well we weren't disappointed at all. The architecture and interior design create some kind of magic atmosphere that brings you to another time of glamour and glitter.We had as well one of the most fantastic guides (a lady in the 50's) that you cold expect. She was knowledgeable, passionate, funny, friendly .. Definitely one of the highlights of our trip to NY"

A the point where you meet the Rockette - youre told to go into the room to have your photo taken with her. Those who weren't keen went to sit on the sofa and the guide went nuts speaking to us like children - make it clear! She also had no enthusiasm for the tour, she sighed when asked questions and stood there rubbing here neck with her eyes closed whilst speaking to us! If I did that at work I wouldn't last long."

My favorite party was getting to go up in the rehearsal rooms. So many celebrities have practiced in there! Just walking around the different levels was pretty cool--even the bathrooms are awesome! So many beautiful artistic details in the building! I have to say, though, I was definitely disappointed that we didn't get to walk anywhere near the stage. We didn't even get to walk on that bottom level because they were setting up for America's Got Talent. We did get to see the stage--but from the very top level, and it was tiny from there. Our guide was..umm.. interesting. She was a bit cranky and a little rude to some members of the group, although she did seem to enjoy her job and the history of the building. Meeting the Rockette wasn't really anything special--just a ploy to get your money for a picture with her. I would have paid for a picture near the stage with her, but not for a random awkward photo with a Rockette in a tiny room. Over all, I enjoyed it. I've always wanted to go inside the building, and it was a great introduction to the space. Very beautiful!"

Our guide was very enthusiastic and was able to answer all of our questions. We had purchased our tickets online before we came and forgot to pack them. The ticket staff was very helpful in getting the reprinted for us. The tour itself only was an hour and worth the time and money it took. Our group got to meet and get a photo taken with a Rockette. This part was fun but a bit gimmicky. You cannot have out your own cameras or phones and they time how long she spends with you. Once everyone walks through the photo line she answers a few questions and then leaves the room through a different door. Fun but not personal for sure."

The mezzanine Is not so great if you're not sitting in the front you can barely see. Orchestra seats are always best make sure they are not too far right or too far left - - if not you won't be able to see and you would have paid a ton of money for the tickets. If there's a show check with your credit card- - depending on the type you have you may be able to get it at a special rate. Also, don't sit too close to the stage - - you'll miss everything.

I'm not sure if there are other options for those in wheelchairs, strollers or otherwise unable to walk up/down stairs. You may want to ask if that is a concern before you go. Also you cannot bring any drinks, food or chew any gum while your in the building."

I took my granddaughter when she was 5 and her eyes were just lit up from the start , through the show, she was just mesmerized and I so enjoyed her beautiful little face as she looked around the music hall in wonder and never took her eyes off the dancers. It was well worth the price, for myself, my daughter, and granddaughter. We were just as taken with the whole place, show, dancers were just outstanding. Girls, boys, young to old, don't miss at least one visit to this iconic new York attraction!"

The behind the scences tour helps you appreciate all that goes in to a production like this.

We also booked the Inside Broadway Tour for 4pm that afternoon (included in NYPass, but pre-booking definitely required). There was plenty of time to eat and wander between these three excellent tours. One of our favorite days in NYC! The Radio City tour itself included getting to meet a Rockette, plenty of art history and building secrets. Would love to see a show there one day! Beautiful. You don't need to book this tour or Rockafeller days in advance, just get there before lunchtime on the day and ask for your preferred time slot (don't be late!)."

The tour was about 25 bucks per person, lasted an hour and a half and takes you through almost every feature of the theatre. The lobby, stage, backstage, offices, and spaces for the Rockettes, were fascinating to see and learn about, thanks to our guide who was personable, pleasant and kept us moving along. Be forewarned, if stairs are an issue, there are a few flights up that are kind of steep. Our group was fine, but I could see older folks or little kids finding it challenging. At the end of the tour, we met a Rockette dancer in costume, and we had the opportunity to have a picture taken with her in front of a green screen that they could create a composite picture for you to purchase later if you chose. She answered questions and helped to provide a face to what is likely the most famous chorus line in the world. I never thought about coming to see the Christmas Spectacular before, as musical theatre is not usually my thing, but after seeing the beautiful space and how much goes into putting on this show, we will very likely look to check it out on our next trip to NY."

It was breathtaking to be able to stand on the stage and look out into the hall. Thank goodness this grand building was saved from the wrecking ball! At the end you get to meet a Rockette dancer, who tells a little about what it takes to be chosen as a Rockette. The tour ends with a photo taken with the Rockette dancer that can be purchased. Really fun for all ages! There are some steps involved, so I'm not sure how handicapped accessible the entire tour is. Please check with the Music Hall if you have concerns regarding this."

We were very lucky to have a small group (we had 7 in our group, whereas the rest of the tours that day had been 30+) but we were there Thanksgiving week.

It is hard to believe that so many NYC icons were built during the Great Depression.We were very fortunate to be able to go on stage and take pics from the stage. Our guide informed us that this is unusual since there is almost always a performance and/or a rehearsal going on.Our tour included a chance to meet and get a picture with a Rockette. We did not know about this, so my daughter really liked that part. The selectivity and rigor of this group and their schedule is impressive to say the least!I highly recommend this tour; the interior of the building is an American landmark!"

We purchased a voucher ahead of time and exchanged it for tickets in the gift shop next door.Our tour was at 2 pm and lasted about 1.5 hours. We got the full tour of the music hall, learned about its history, got to go backstage to see the hydraulics system that power the platforms up and down. Truly a feat in engineering and even more amazing, the system is the original one installed when the theatre was built. During their last renovation, the system was inspected and needed no replacement. Also interesting is that the military came to Radio City to examine their system and utilized the same technology on aircraft carriers in WWII.Part of the tour focused on the Art Deco decor in the theatre. Very beautiful and the restoration brought the theatre back to life. The tour included a whole history on the Rockettes, including costuming, and we even got to meet a Rockette. Even my husband, who is not a dance fan, found the tour interesting from a historical and technological standpoint. I highly recommend this tour. Hoping we can maybe see a show there soon."

While I have yet to see a show at Radio City Music Hall, I have taken the Stage Door Tour is a great way to see the facility.My big beef with this tour are the people who claim they don't know any English. No photos is pretty universal. When I visited, they were setting up for Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga and the guide was clear, no photos allowed in the auditorium. While we were sitting in the auditorium and she was giving her talk, what was a 60+ year old German man doing with his iPad? Taking photos and videos of course. When we were sitting in the downstairs lounge for a washroom break, a 40 year old hispanic man walked into the women's washroom to take pictures WHILE WOMEN WERE STILL INSIDE! When we were upstairs and there were dance classes going on to teach future Rockettes, the German man was standing in the doorway taking videos despite being told not to. He also sat on the furniture in Roxy's suite (another thing you're told not to do and he was upset when he was told to get up). He also tried taking pictures of the Rockette at the end of the tour, again, being told not to.Why is this such a problem? It ruins it for everyone else, next time you won't be able to take any pictures on the tour and that would be a real shame.When you do meet the Rockette, some questions you can ask are how many girls audition, how many times can you audition, when do the auditions take place and where are they placed once they are hired, Sometimes people don't ask questions and to me, that is just a waste of their time."

One of the saddest things about Tripadvisor is finding an event or attraction which is a lot of fun, but not in the Tripadvisor database! One of these is the Fox and Friends All-American Summer Concert Series, held between late May and late August once a week (usually Friday's). Check the website for details, but they are held early in the day, are free, and have free catered food! This is a great deal, and you can get right up close to the bands. Take the B, D, F, or M trains to the Rockefeller Center stop and you are ther! Simple as that. Enjoy."

We were put in a group with Danielle. He is so full of enthusiasm for this industry is is contagious! There is nothing Danielle does not know about the Radio City Hall and entertainment business in general. They really pick tour guides well in New York - I don't think we had a mediocre one in our visit. The tour was informative, interesting and fun. They seem to have cut out a couple of things since my last visit like seeing the hydraulics under the stage and the table where Judy Garland was sitting at, but still well worth a morning visit and you get your photo taken with one of the Rockettes.I think of all our guides Danielle for our favourite.

Meeting a leggy Rockette in full sequinned costume isn't too bad either!"

You arrive with your advance purchased tickets, and you are put in groups of twenty-six. It is a seventy-five minute tour where you go from top to bottom of the theatre, and see it all. We were lucky enough to be there the weekend of the Tony Awards so the cast was rehearsing and we got to watch. You get the history of how they put those great shows together along with the story of the Rockettes. This is a fabulous tour worth the time and money."

He can \"kick\" higher then the Rockettes and talks about \"we\" and \"us\" when referring to famous singers, dancers (like he's famous and \"belongs in the club\" lol). Apparently he does not know that a Porsche is standing in the Foyer as he said its a Ferrari. A small boy corrected him lol! Oh well, if you have him as a tour guide just don't take him too serious. He's friendly and tries to make some jokes but what's really interesting is the whole building and its history. He also took away already a story that the Rockette would tell us one more time (and he knows that she is gonna tell it to us). The Rockette was cute but apparently learned to say her \"text\" without emotion. I like how they kept the concept of the history when remodeling but still included high technology on stage. Too bad we were not able to go on stage as they were practicing for the Tony awards. Must see for sure!"

The acoustics are still amazing...really not a bad seat in the house. The venue now accommodates all of today's latest lighting and video technology, with some of the old time 'razzle-dazzle' features, such as huge projection screens, gigantic backdrops and huge items hydraulically rising from below the stage.

But they all DO manage to kick at the same time, and, especially at Christmas they pull out all the stops with a live Camel and a special appearance by the Baby Jesus (okay maybe not the REAL Baby Jesus, but he sure looks like him!) The building is truly gorgeous but overall I think there are more rewarding ways to spend your money in the City That Never Sleeps."

Came here to see the Rockettes, which was a wonderful event I would recommend to anyone, but the Music Hall itself is an atttraction. As you enter the Grand Foyer you can allow yourself to be transported back to the glamourous 1920's and 30's in an affluent Art Deco style. The theatre itself, following more formal Art Deco lines, with its radiating arches gives you a feeling of intimacy with the stage, yet when you bring your focus away from the stage the pure grandeur of the theatre is incredible."

This year some parts were 3D which is primarily one of the few ways the show has changed since I first saw it back in 1979. It's a standard that is an effective way to get someone into the holiday spirit. The facility is something to see with ornate chandeliers, beautiful architecture, and incredible acoustics. The Rockettes never disappoint either, even though they do discriminate against short dancers. I don't think this is something I would do yearly, but is one of those experiences that everyone one who celebrates Christmas should do once."

Staircase and ceiling, even the restrooms are amazing. Secondly, the show itself was so entertaining and professional. I had a tear in the eye when the Rockettes did their thing as I couldn't quite believe I was seeing this iconic performance in person. Thirdly, just sitting there inside the beautiful atmospheric theatre imagining all the shows and history gone on before was moving. Why did I take so long to come here?

It looks good among the cityscape in the daylight, yet the evening glows of red neon lights make it really come alive. The 1930\u2019s theater is a well maintained art deco classic. We were fortunate enough to get tickets for the Spring Spectacular in April. The performance was a story about all the great things about New York. The legendary Rockettes were the obvious highlight throughout. The scenes involved places like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Statue of Liberty and Central Park through dance and music. The Rockettes even did sports scenes done up as the New York sports teams. The audience participation skit was entertaining, as well. At times it seemed like an infomercial or live advertisement for the city of New York, but was still really entertaining. Animated figures and video clips periodically gave the dancers their occasional rests. The sound in this huge amphitheater was amazing as well. Although Derek Hough was not available, Taylor Frey stepped into the spotlight and was awesome. We had a wonderful time during the ninety minute show and are looking forward to the next Radio City performance we can enjoy."

We were shown around the theatre by a very friendly informative guide, and given an insight into the history of both the theatre and the 'Rockettes'. The tour also gave the opportunity to meet and have a photograph taken with one of the dancers. We purchased tickets for the matinee performance the following day and opted for the cheapest seats at \u00a339. There is no such thing as a bad seat in this theatre so I would advise to save your money. The show itself was fantastic, the dancing, the band, the technology knocked the socks off any broadway shows I have seen."

My parents took me there for years to see the Rockettes, and other entertainers (I remember best Cab Calloway because I got to shake his hand) and it was fabulous. Just viewing the inside alone is worth a trip to this landmarked building.Now I take my grandchildren to Radio City Music Hall. They've all seen the \"Christmas Show\" (except the two in Florida), which is truly spectacular and memorable each year. However, a friend and I just saw the \"Spring Spectacular\" and both agreed ... it's strictly for tourists. Now, I'm not casting any aspersions on tourists ... it's just that I don't have to see film clips to visualize Macy's, the Empire State Building, etc., etc. I can GO there anytime I want!This \"Spring Spectacular\" had little action by the Rockettes, who are marvelous, so that was disappointing. The rest of the show was a combination of Dancing with the Stars, and the culmination of every movie filmed in New York,from \"White Christmas\" to \"It Happened One Night\", and showed pictures of the monumental buildings and sites in NYC. It was totally boring for a Native New Yorker, and as far as we were concerned, a waste of money. Their advertising it pre-Easter as an Easter Spectacular is even more absurd, because the only thing they had about Easter was a person in a bunny suit, running across the stage! This was the ONLY time I was disappointed in a show at Radio City Music Hall."

The replacement for him did a great job though. It is more like a play/musical with the Rockettes added. Definitely glad I got to see it. But, why would you open the doors for 6,000 people so late. We were standing inline outside then were told we needed to go to another door. So we did that and had to wait longer. By the time we got in, they were already flickering the lights and hundreds of people were still coming in. I tried to get a drink before the show and the lady was so rude. She asked if I was in line? Of course I was in line. I did not pass anybody, I was waiting like everybody else. She made me question if I was in the correct line. (which I was) I was so embarrassed and unsure that I just said nevermind. Then when trying to get to our seats, the ushers were yelling and were extremely rude. Especially a tall red haired lady. I had never in my life been to a show where the attendants were that downright awful and disorganized. There was also an issue with a man sitting near me regarding his seats. Not clear what was happening but it lasted until well after the show started and was very distracting. Also, hundreds of people were trying to get to their seats after the show started. Maybe if the opened the doors at a proper time this would not have happened. I have been to RCMH before and nothing like this had ever happened. I was extremely appalled by the people working there. I hope this was a one-time deal."

To top it off, there are discount tickets available because there are only a few days left which makes this show truly affordable compared to overpriced full price broadway tickets.

Personally when I went to get a drink from the bar I asked if they served Red Bull and Vodka (being super jet lagged I wanted something with a punch to wake me up) only for the lady at the bar to start yelling at me - \"Hell no we don't serve no Red Bull...Red Bull nearly killed my husband! It gave him a heart attack!!!\" I would understand if this woman spoke politely and was making small talk about her personal experiences with the beverage I requested, but this woman was almost in hysterics yelling at me. A few other patrons where even turning heads to see what was going on. Drinks are expensive, snacks are expensive and merchandise was expensive.

Laura was good, certainly different from her Law & Order SVU appearances and I found myself waiting for the famous Doo-Doo to happen, anyway...Loved the opening choreography, the story was cute, filled with facts about NYC and made you realise how much New York is engrained into everyone's lives from the movies/TV Shows that are filmed here to the attractions and sights, makes you fall in love with New York City all over again! My only \"critique\" is aimed at the sporting montage and the transition through the sports could've been quicker as at some points it seemed a little slow. I could understand what they were trying to achieve but, even as talented as the Rockette's are, for me there just wasn't much they could do with a hockey stick and it just slowed the story down a little. But all in all I am glad I saw it, light up bracelets, #D and of course some crowd participation was asked for and they got it and snagged a free box of popcorn during the baseball sequence! Favorite moment: The live band, Opening sequence and Central Park scene"

Each tour is different though, so that actually made it better. I think they have a list of so many possible stops the tour can make, but only time for about 25% of them so each tour guide gets to put his or her own spin on things and you get to see different things all the time.

With its hokey story line around NYC attractions and iconic landmarks, it felt more of a tourist-trap than anything else. Radio City Music Hall is a beautiful venue. If you have seen Radio City's Christmas Spectacular, this show is NOTHING in comparison. In fact, this show was extremely disappointing. The Rockettes weren't even featured as the primary source of the entertainment. They served as more of a backdrop to a very cheesy plot.I think the hype about this show is seeing Derek Hough from \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d. Don't get me wrong, his dancing is very good. But honestly, I can watch DWTS if I want to see him dance. I paid to see the Rockettes, and I didn't feel like they were featured as they should've been.Also, there was a lot of hype and anticipation built up by being given 3D glasses upon entrance...only to be disappointed when the 3D video itself is pretty dumb, has nothing to do with the Rockettes, and lasts less than a minute of the show. Also, we weren't even given the light-up wristbands which added to our aggravation and to our 9 year old little girl's disappointment because she didn't have one.Bottom line: before you buy tickets to see this show, read this review. http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/theater/review-new-york-spring-spectacular-barrels-into-radio-city.html?_r=0Another tip: Don't pre-buy tickets to this show. There were people all over the place handing out flyers to buy these tickets at a discount. Honestly, I wouldn't go back and see this show again, even if it was free."

When I heard Derek Hough was going to be on the big stage with the Rockets I had to go. A big fan of Derek's from his work on \"Dancing with the Stars\" we bought really great seats and I was very excited. Unfortunately Derek broke his toe and did not perform that night. I was crushed. All was not lost. We still had a good time. The show is a cheesy, mash up of touristy , silly, hokey stuff with bracelets that light and 3-D glasses. The scenery is fabulous. Laura Benati is a real professional with a good voice. The young sub for Derek although not a star is a very good dancer, sweet and with a winning way. and the ROCKETTES are wonderful. I hadn't seen the Rockettes in person since I went with my Grandma to see them with a movie called Lilli ( with Leslie Caron). So you know not one of the current Rockettes were even born then. Go just to see them. Everyone in the audience seemed to have a great time. You can't keep your legs still."

Everything from the fixtures, to the stairways, to the bathrooms still has that distinct art deco look and feel.This is a huge venue, it seats about 6,000 people.If you're getting tickets orchestra middle in the first 20 rows is the best, but since the acoustics are amazing it's good all the way through.We were here for Derek Hough and the Rockettes and I think he went a long way in modernizing the show.

Been a while since we went to the Christmas Show and decided we would enjoy the fantastic Spring Day (finally) in NYC. They really have check-in down to a science. Show your tickets, get the ticket scanned, go on inside. Once inside we saw that there were drinks and snacks available. We ordered 2 drinks, price on par with what you would expect to pay at a concert venue, and had a nice chat with the server. She told us that she loved the show but wouldn't spoil it by telling us what the wristbands were for or any of the surprises. We went to the door for our section where yet another pleasant employee greeted us and gave us our 3-d glasses and booklets. 3-D glasses and wrist bands? Whoa! What is going on here? She got the attention of an usher and we were shown to our seats. Keep in mind these were last minute and not full price but the view from our seats was great. Main floor, left side, row ZZ. While we sat there sipping our refreshments we watched as seats were removed to allow folks in wheelchairs to slip into a row with there friends and family. Seems the back row of some sections, maybe all, have this feature. The guy that was removing the seats was quick, a couple of taps, bing, bang, boom and out comes two seats and in moves the person with their wheelchair. Seems so much better than being seated off to one side or the other. In all we saw four sections of chairs removed and stowed in our immediate area. Like I said, Radio City has it down to a science, no one is excluded. The show itself was spectacular. The orchestra was brilliant, the songs catchy classics, the story line, though contrived, acted as the vehicle to take the audience on a tour of NYC in all its splendor. The special effects and 3-D were magic. I don't want to include any spoilers but more than once we were saying to each other, \"How'd they do that?\". Add to that the iconic Rockettes with above the head kicks (how do they do THAT?) and the singing and dancing of Derek Hough and Laura Benanti with the rest of the cast and you have a home run. Just ask Bernie. :-)"

What an incredible production! At some points the show veers on the cheesy side but overall I loved it and it made me proud to be a New Yorker. This is a great visual experience and I was in awe especially at the Grand Central Terminal replica-the way they had the light filtering through the windows and the props-it made you feel like you were at the real place...minus the swarms of people. Derek Hough is incredibly talented and stars in this spectacular show and even sings!! I'd be wrong if i didn't mention the fantastic full orchestra that is the heartbeat of the show. The opening number, \"Welcome To New York\" by Taylor Swift is an upbeat and joyful way to kick off the show and I thought it was great. The fashion week section was a bit too long and I felt a little overplayed. This is a showcase of NYC and the sets are grand and beautiful in every way but another highlight was Amy Poehler and Tina Fey as Patience and Prudence, the NYPL lions. So many memorable numbers in this show, and so good I bought another near front row seat for closing day on May 7th.This is a great show for families or singles alike and I think there is something for every age. Of course who wouldn't love enjoying a show in this iconic hall? Thank you Rockettes for another inspiring and incredible show! Still photography is allowed with no flash and no video recording devices are allowed. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get seated properly and if you don't know where to go there are helpful ushers always nearby. Show is 90 minutes and the subway is directly outside the doors on 50th."

Minor audience participation if you're seated in the orchestra section. You're given interactive bracelets which light up throughout the night. Also, if you're interested in waiting by the stage door for autographs, you need to go out the rear exits and walk to the right. We had to ask because we wanted to wait for Derek Hough, who does come out and takes pictures and signs autographs."

Laura & the Rockettes were great but Derek Hough was the STAR and his singing, dancing were amazing and magical. He is one heck of an entertainer. The venue was a spectacle worth seeing - rain on the stage, larger than life set. In fact, I'm going again this Saturday, April 17th. It's that good. NYC is shown to its best advantage and you'll leave with the biggest smile on your face. Worth every cent. Great job RCMH! It is SPECTACULAR!"

The show was an alive and captivating story of NY - the props and scenes were excellent, especially \"Singing in the Rain\" and \"Empire State Building\". Show runs for just on 1 1/2 hrs, would have enjoyed more but that's Broadway! Thought the drinks were over priced ($15 glass wine) but one wouldn't break the bank to enjoy your experience.

On Saturday,April 11th,yesterday,i took in the Spring Spectacular @ Radio City Music Hall in New York City.there were 2 shows one @ 5 pm and another @ 8 pm,i went to the 5 pm.being a gorgeous,spring day in NYC,i arrived early to Penn station via the LIRR and decided to walk the 17-18 blocks to Radio City. here is the not so brief story line,Derek Hough[from DWTS] plays a character in limbo between earth and heaven awaiting his wings.God gives him a task to earn his wings,to help Benny retain his job as a long time NYC tour guide who's in jeopardy of being fired after a billionaire woman[Laura Benanti]who hates to enjoy herself and doesn't like to have fun, takes over the tour company and wants to replace Benny with an automated cartoon version of Benny.Derek convinces Laura to take one of Bennys tours thru NYC.they visit numerous attractions such as the Museum of Art,the NY Public Library,Empire State Bldg and Statue of Liberty trying to persuade Laura to see Bennys value as a tour guide.in a scene from ancient Egypt Tina Fey's voice speaks from a lions statue and in another Whoopie Goldberg is Gods voice.in the end Laura sees the error in her plan and realizes Bennys value.the show is an exhilarating,whirlwind tour de force with numerous superb Rockettes dancing scenes with and without Laura and Derek,both whom are excellent singing dancing and acting.it is a must see show that ran 1 hr and 26 that i highly recommend ! ! running thru early May.oh and i almost forgot,there are several Rockettes scenes with a sports theme one each with the NY Rangers,NY Yankees,NY Knicks and NY Giants featuring cameos by Henrique Lundqvist,Joe Girardi,Carmello Anthony and Michael Stahan exhorting Benny not to give up on swaying Laura."

You can see, that the folks care about everyone viewing the show, they even added the Easter Bunny for the kids, well maybe for the adults also, by the great reactions. They even had dogs, they had something for everyone. The best way to tell if a show is great or not, by the amount of folks who get up for bathroom runs. I only saw 2 for the entire show and they were back fast. If you can afford it, put it on the the list to do. If you are a Delta Flyer, Delta has what they call a Sky Club on the 2nd floor, nothing more then a counter that serves drinks and a few small tables."

We thought it could have been a bit longer and we certainly did not need to see the Easter bunny in the show, very out of place. You don't always need to include Christmas and/or Easter in these shows!!The theatre is beautiful but huge, 6000 seats!!! So much going on besides the show....food and drink for sale, souvenirs, photos with a Rockette, etc. A note to all, especially the women visiting...use the restroom at the restaurant you are coming from. The line for the restrooms both upstairs and downstairs was mind boggling. As the clock ticked closer to show time I got brave and got out of line and walked straight into the men's room!!"

They showed us the hydraulic stage system that was so advanced for its time. You should experience this place if you can because it's a piece of history and you never know how long it will be around.

We landed in NYC on 3/28 and got to our Hotel around 3 - We went into Times Square to the TKTS ticket booth and were able to get a fabulous deal on tickets to the Show! We had brought our 11 year old son and traveling with Friends and their 10 year old son for Spring Break. We were shocked at how awesome this show was for ALL ages and genders!! Seriously, we all LOVED it!!! The boys we sitting up leaned forward in their seats the entire time! It told a great story of a older man trying to keep his position as a NYC tour guide and he \"took\" us on a tour of the City! That made it the perfect 1st night and show for our boys being their first trip to New York! It showed them what all to look forward to seeing in the coming days! I could not be more pleased that we went to this show and I highly recommend it to all :) Be sure to download the TKTS app to your phone and check THE DAY OF the show to see if it on sale - It updates throughout the day. This is great to do for all Shows. There are 3 locations in NYC - Times Square, Downtown Brooklyn, & South Street Seaport"

We were told this was for audience participation. The glasses were used very quickly and it was surprisingly effective. Also the bracelets played an enjoyable part. I don't want to spoil it for the lucky people who will attend. The dancing was spirited and absolutely in sinc. The costumes were colorful and sparkling at times.

I would say if 10 was perfect I would give it a solid 8, If you are coming to see Derek Hough, he really isn't dancing that much. He Is in every scene and SINGS but dances in maybe about 5. The story is very good for tourists and family friendly with chicks, bunnies and real dogs on stage and child actors. Music is toe tapping and colors are bright. The Rockettes as often as I have seen them, are something Ii never get tired of and their pitch perfect leg kicks give me goose bumps. If I have any criticism at all, I think they should have included the fireman and police men at some point in the background. It was fun seeing Derek live and I wish he had danced more"

We went to see the new show \"A Spring Spectacular\". While I was dubious of the name, it was nothing short of SPECTACULAR! The sets, the staging, the music, the performers, the orchestra and then of course the Rockettes!! I never would have thought I would enjoy a show with the Rockettes, but this was fun all the way.

We took our out of town friends to see this show - and we all loved it. Amazing music, dancing, choreography, singing...it had a little bit of everything, and each scene was short enough to keep the kids interested the entire show. The interactive nature of the show beats the Christmas Spectacular by just a wee bit, but the Nativity scene in the Christmas show is so beautiful...I can't really decide which one is better. See them both if you can! Loved the visual tour of NYC, especially for those who have limited time on their trip - our guests felt that they had \"visited\" some of the attractions that we didn't have time to take them to. 4 stars because the women's bathroom situation is really something that needs to be rectified. There is a huge sitting room outside of the actual washrooms that should undergo a renovation for more toilets."

It is an overview of all of NYC and for someone who no longer lives there, it was fun to have a reminder of all there is to do in the city that never sleeps. They didn't miss a detail of each event: (i.e. when they mentioned the Knicks, they had staff shoot tee shirts with the cannons into the audience, and during the baseball segment, staff went up and down the aisles throwing boxes of popcorn to people who put up their hands). The Rockettes, Laura Benanti and Derek Hough were all wonderful. My complaints: not near enough bathrooms. I do not know if there is anything that can be done, but the line was as long as I have ever seen. And I travel frequently and attend many shows. The yelling staff: they gave us bracelets to wear, and rather than make return boxes visible and plentiful (they were there, but hard to find), they had staff standing and screaming about returning them. One man was almost insulting, as he yelled at the top of his lungs the whole ten minutes it took us to pass him, almost accusing everyone of stealing these things. They could have solved the problem by telling everyone when they handed us the bracelets."

I found product placements in every scene... even the pre-show where most theatres remind audience to switch of their phones, here at radio city audience was only told not to take pictures with flash. Then the announcement followed by a series of ads lasted 2 minutes. The whole show we have audiences snapping pictures and talking... completely ruined my theatre-going experience. As for the show itself... it definitely suffered from an identity crisis. The show went from 3D to puppetry to a game show then back to a fashion show... everytime the dogs ran across the stage I rolled my eyes. The most consistent act is the Rockettes! This is not my cup of tea... Lion King has awesome stage production too, but the narration is consistent. To me, substance is more important than the fluff... Parents, take your kids to the Lion King, Matilda or Finding Neverland so they'll appreciate true arts. Adults, there is no excuse not to experience real theatres since they are only a block away. Unless you are one of those who like to take pictures and have other phones flashing in your eyes."

The Rockettes were beyond a doubt the STARS of this show, with second billing go to the Radio City Orchestra who provided an exciting foundation to every moment of the show.Everyone else was there in a supporting role, providing a storyline to connect the Rockettes dance numbers and dance the did. The Rockettes were featured in several wonderful dance routines that allowed them to showcase a wonderfully talented dance troupe. When that kick line formed and charged the audience the excitement was palpable.The story line was derivative, culled from multiple sources, bit served well enough to knit together an enjoyable afternoon of entertainment. The cameos were a bit gimmicky and amounted to more or less name dropping.The show has a ways to go before it matches the Christmas show for \"Spectacularity\", but was an enjoyable event.If you are in the City, have the time and the price is right, by all means go and enjoy the Rockettes!"

The one thing that let it down was that we never actually got to go inside the auditorium. They were rehearsing for the New York Spring Spectacular, so we were only allowed to look inside the auditorium from the spotlight box at the top of the theatre.However I would recommend to anyone visiting NY to do the tour"

I now have children of my own and wanted to do something special with them for the holiday season. I really never was crazy about going to see the rockettes or the spectacular because, i thought, ok ive seen tons of santas, and ive seen people dance on stage before... ehhh. Well, i was wrong. This show is every bit and more everything good youve ever heard about it. I was very impressed with the rockettes and their precision and they have some pretty long dance sets, and alot of them. The show was great, the story line was great. I think i may have enjoyed myself more than my children. I would definitely suggest everyone, especially native new yorkers to go see it. We forget all the beauty around us, when your surrounded by it all the time."

We sat 6 rows from the stage, aisle seats and were in AWE. I would recommend maybe a little further back and more towards the center for best viewing of the effects, but it was fine... Some out-of-towners might not understand who some of the famous cameos are and some of the jokes might be lost because of that, but still a fantastic show...not to be missed!!!"

The tour guide was very informative and querky too. When we went to the observation area to look down at the stage it took my breath away. They were rehearsing for the Spring Spectacular show so was difficult to take photos but when they were off stage had the opportunity to do so. The stage is the biggest and most technical stage in the world. We also had the opportunity to speak to a Rockette and also have a photo taken with her. Generally photos are $25 although they do more for special offers. Definitely a MUST do during your vacation to the Big Apple!"

The program they sell for a small fee really was a hit with my children. Good food options, and not too costly inside.Cons- Of course so crowded, but what bothered us was the selling of all the alcohol at what we felt was a family event. I'm sure the profits are why they do it, but wish that part wasn't there. Had a few 'rowdy' people in the row in front of us, no ushers seemed to address it.If you've never been, would recommend. Be careful about buying tickets..so many prices out there from Ticketmaster directly, to personal sellers, etc. quite overwhelming, and still not sure if I got a great or a good deal, but didn't pay full price, so that was good..I think!"

The girl who spoke about everything was so good at what she did. She had such a lot of knowledge on everything from artists and the people that made the clothes, people that did the stage etc. Its a good 90mins tour but one thing they didnt tell you when you bought the tickets is that there are heaps of stairs to climb. the lady did say she could get someone to take me in the lift but that just made me determined to climb them even if I was slow."

Its unthinkable that they wanted to close it the 70's with its famous Rockettes.

The history of this wonderful place is incredibly rich. We were also shown the mechanism behind the stage which is very intricate. At the end we got to meet a Rockette but the part I liked less was being held there while everyone had a take a photo with a Rockette which they were going to try and make us buy after the tour.

Once the show starts, sit back and enjoy a very traditional and beautiful Rockettes show."

Another fun thing to do is to photograph the building during the holiday season. In addition to seeing the famous vertical 'Radio City Hall' sign, you will also find a tall christmas tree structure made of bulb lights, which change colour from white, purple and red. Unfortunately due to crowds, it can be difficult to make your pictures in the evening when the nightlight makes for ideal photos. What you can do is head out early in the morning, before sunrise and take the photos before the streets fill with people. Further, a great spot for picture taking is near the adjacent Associates of America building, behind the pool with the giant christmas tree ornament display. Here you can fit the giant ornaments in the same frame as the Radio City Hall christmas tree and sign (see accompanying pictures)."

We did this and also found the ticket-seller to be very helpful to get good seats. Look for discounts on line or by mail, of course if you want them for a matinee during peak season, discounts are practically non-existent. My only criticism is that due to crowd control, we were rushed in to the theater, and rushed out as soon as the show ended to reload the seats. Bathrooms lines were long, and we would have liked to do the photo with the Rockettes or even get some souvenirs but had almost no time even to see the theater which is beautiful.

Best by far was the Toy Solders Parade, which I guess is so good that it has remained pretty much the same since it was first introduced in the 30's.Where else can you go to a show that finishes with a nativity scene with live camels and sheep on stage accompanied by two mighty Wurlitzer organs - LOLTotally over the top really, but nevertheless a great evening's entertainment, and at 90 minutes just long enough for the grandkids."

The stages settings are amazing. The 3 D portion of the show is captivating.The end of the show brought tears to my eyes, although I am a bit saddened that they used live animals on the stage. If you go to see this show, it is well worth the price for seats in the mid orchestra section from about 10 to 12 rows from orchestra. Also, it is good to get there early as children and adults can have their pictures taken with Santa and/or with one of the Rockettes. I could easily see this show every year!!"

There is no intermission, and you don't want to miss the show, nor do you want to miss the twin organs playing before the show starts. The line to get in is also spectacular, bag checks and ticket checks do take a few minutes, even thought they have three lines to get in once you get closer. Once in, every seat in the house is good, but keep in mind, the premium seats are premium for a reason (think confetti, santa coming in up the aisles, reasons kids will long to sit in those seats, but you will be perhaps reluctant to pay the steep prices for those privileges). It is (obviously) a very large theatre, so if you are sitting up top, opera glasses are nice to have. Now, on with the show! Sme things have changed through the years, keeping it fresh. Still, not a show to go to every year for most of us. The most important non-changes are the Rockettes and their precision. They are fantastic, just like you think they should be. The scenery and costumes are marvelous, the props are unimaginable when you think of \"props\", a bus isn't usually one you imagine. The music is equal to the show on the stage, I don't know how else to describe it! One other tradition that has never changed (and hopefully will never be changed) is the final scene, the nativity. We love it. Go once if you can, you won't be disappointed."

I had been to RCMH way back in the 70s as a kid and really had no desire to see a kitchy show, but my wife talked me into going to the Christmas Spectacular. Bottom line - we had a blast. The show is fast, entertaining, plenty of Rockettes kicking, a 3D segment, the venue is fantastic, and the time positively flew by. The best part for me? Hearing all of kids squealing when Santa (our MC for the show) took the stage. Only three things that were minor annoyances:1) concessions are ridiculously expensive.2) there was a constant murmur/hum of people talking. I've never understand why people would shell out that much money and find it necessary to talk during the show3) the late arriving crowd - for the first 15 minutes our view was constantly blocked by late arriving people. This is really curious as the staff has the whole 'get em in get em out' process down to a science.Should any of those deter you from going? Absolutely not. Doesn't matter if you're 100, 5, or any age in between, this is a wonderful show that will really enhance the holiday spirit."

The show was much better than I expected. I thought it would be all about dancing but they did a very nice job mixing in stories and other dancers/actors which made it very interesting to my 6 year old as well. It's definitely worth it!! Would go back again.The only comment is that they need to do something about the entrance and lines. We bought the tickets on line and opted for the eTicket option. At the main entrance they sent us to the side door because that's were ticket holders are allowed in. We went all around and got on line only to not be allowed in because we 'didn't' have tickets. We showed them the email with the tickets that we received but since it only had a bar code and not a QR code, their readers couldn't scan it so they made us go all around again to the main entrance to then have the tickets printed at the box office. They should correct that eTicket option to read differently or include the correct code in the email. Would have rated excellent if it weren't for this issue."

The synchronization of the dancers is absolutely amazing. There's a side story with Santa Claus, a tribute to the Nutcracker, and a surprising tribute to the true meaning of Christmas with a manger scene at the end of the show. Overall, this is a very entertaining show for young and old alike and definitely a must-do during the holiday season in NYC!

We attended a 1 pm weekday showing of the Rockettes Christmas Spectacular during the week of Christmas and arrived 45 minutes early, not knowing what to expect regarding lines or crowds. While the will-call line was terribly long, the line for folks with tickets in hand was non-existent and we walked right in. It helped that an employee was standing on the corner with a sign indicating which way to go, and that the \"search\" of our bag was courteously performed and brief. (It should be mentioned here that all representatives of RCMH were friendly and helpful.) Once inside, we were amazed at the beauty of Radio City Music Hall. The art deco style, soaring ceilings, rich colours, immense chandeliers, and old-fashioned lushness were gawk-worthy. There were several counters at which to purchase popcorn, soft drinks, candy, hot pretzels, alcoholic beverages, etc, which could be taken into the theatre (refreshments from outside are not allowed). Prices, as expected, were high, although a drinks and popcorn combo was available which saved a couple dollars. Many climbed the long staircases to the upper levels, but there are elevators, tucked a bit away from easy view. Just ask if you cannot find them. Restrooms, located throughout, retained their historical charm, complete with adjoining lounges, hand-dryers with foot pedals, pedestal sinks, makeup mirrors, and little phone booths with stools.Our seats were located in the mezzanine, but due to the design, shape, and acoustics of the hall, there truly is not a bad seat in the house. In fact, sitting up higher allows a view downward on the Rockettes' formations that's not available from the orchestra seats. A few minutes before the performance, Christmas songs were beautifully played on the magnificent double Wurlitzer organs. The show itself began on time, lasted exactly 1 hour 30 minutes, and was simply... flawless. The Rockettes were amazing, the orchestra was superb, the story lines and timing were appropriate for all ages (and for holding little ones' attention), and the effects (some seen with provided 3-D glasses) were fun. The Wooden Soldiers routine was a favorite, as was Santa flying through NYC on his sleigh. It was a perfect show for getting into the Christmas spirit. The crowning glory, though, was the portrayal of the Nativity story. Besides the fantastical costuming, passionate musical accompaniments, and live animals (sheep, camels, donkey (which were met with audible delight by the audience), this 10-minute scene was show-stopping. It is so rare to see such a joyful and unapologetic display of the Christian Nativity, it brought tears to my eyes. Bravo and thank you!This was a highlight of our Christmas in NYC. Highly recommend for 2015."

We went to the Christmas Spectacular whilst on a 5 day holiday in New York just prior to Christmas.The show is fabulous & was certainly for me the highlight of all the many things we did during our stay.Be aware that some shows can get very busy and the crowds & queues gathering outside can be a bit overwhelming. The hall itself is a spectacular venue, right from the entrance hall through to the main auditorium. The Christmas Spectacular is a long standing tradition in New York. This type of dancing is not always my thing but you cannot fail to be staggered by the performance.The special effects used are very good, especially the 3D. All the performers are clearly of an exceptionally high standard. My only criticism is that as they try to fit in as many shows as possible, each show starts right on time. Not a bad thing you may think. Unfortunately, due to the crowds, the queues & people not anticipating just how busy NYC is at this time of year, there is a constant stream of people coming in to the auditorium during the performance. At our show, some people arrived even an hour in to the show. Difficult to devise a solution here. Maybe put a no admittance notice if say more than 15mins late. Alternatively maybe ask the late comers to sit or stand at the back of the hall so as not to disturb everyone already seated. This may seem a bit picky but it was a constant distraction throughout. If you're in NYC & looking for a festive show, I would have no hesitation in recommending the Christmas Spectacular at Radio City."

I really enjoyed the bus scene and thought the girls did an excellent job. The Music Hall is huge and it's worth visiting to see the huge chandelier in the foyer. I will add that my husband and the other men with us did not enjoy the show. They were bored."

And, boy was it spectacular, one of the best shows I have ever seen in my life! We booked this show because I could not get tickets for the Lion King nor Aladdin. This was much cheaper so I was not expecting much. I thought, how much more can they do than what you see on the the Thanksgiving Day Parade? Well . . .A LOT more. This was a true treat. Worth every penny and every single minute we were there. Visually stunning, incredible choreography, amazing number of dancers in perfect synchrony. And, the theatre is gorgeous too! You have got to see it!"

The stage is very large and sound system is great. We had seats in the first row of one of the mezzanine levels and they were fantastic. We were able to see everything happening on the main stage as well as side areas. I would recommend eating before going into the theater as choices are limited and very expensive. We also purchased our tickets prior to our trip and might have been able to do better on the cost if we had looked into some of the deals you can get in the city, but we were very happy with our seats and location. Your bags will be searched upon entry. Lots of beautiful building details, even in the restrooms."

Yes, It's touristy and expensive, but everyone should see the famous Rockettes, particularly during Christmas. There are discounts online, such as Travelzoo or Groupon, and discounts when you sign up with the Radio City website.My seats were in Center Orchestra, row L, and I found it to be a tad far. It was even more frustrating that an asian lady with poofy hair kept moving, blocking my view, so I had to move and shift to be able to see. During the show I had to go to the ladies room and found out that the back few rows were not taken. I actually had a better view in the back, than behind Poofy Lady. I'd rather get closer seats than centered seats next time. Perhaps that's my preference, but closer seems better."

In the words of my 12 year old - \"too much singing and dancing.\" Ha! I would not hesitate to take a family here, but girls will probably enjoy this much more than young boys. If only I had a daughter . . . Show is about 90 minutes, with no intermission.Tips: Seating: Last time sat in 1st row balcony, this time row NN center orchestra. I much preferred the view from up close. Try not to use the restrooms before/after the show if you can help it. The lines are longer than any I've ever seen anywhere. Also, the crowds outside the theater are insane and make it hard to cross the street."

Only 90 minutes, as others have noted, but perfectly delightful. Incredible visual effects from computer graphics of toy trains arching over everyone in the huge hall on the gold curved ceiling. And the Rockettes were exciting. They did a toy soldier routine that was precise and well-drilled and fantastic to watch, down to the slow-motion toppling of all the soldiers with a shot from a stage canon. And then there were the globes that rose in unison from the orchestra pit and hovered together over the audience, driven by drones (?). Breath-taking! If you missed this year's show, there's always next year, but you really do have to book tickets in advance. The lines are incredibly long, otherwise. Everyone will love the experience, old and young alike."

(As another contributor mentioned: look around, there are discounts to be had.) The skill and precision of the dancers is impressive, and the quality of the costumes, sets and production makes it worth the cost.

The streets around it gets very crowded. You wait in line outside for them to check your tickets to get inside. Once inside you have an opportunity to walk around and experience the Hall. The music starts about 10 minutes before showtime. And it's a 90 minute show that is truly excellent to behold."

It was much better there with all of the special effects and the stage production. It was such a wonderful show. It was expensive, but once you see it with all of the pizzaz you will know why and well worth it. Although the price for the tee shirts and snacks do not have to be so expensive. You will enjoy it."

There are a variety of new numbers and the collective effort is amazing. Music, choreography, colors, costumes- just amazing. If seeing/experiencing this majestic theatre isn't enough, seeing the rockettes perform seals the deal. Two cautions- this time we had center stage middle orchestra seats (row A-great seats) but they are just a bit above eye level to the stage- if you have children be aware- they will have trouble seeing over the person in front of them.Also, with no disrespect meant to non- Christians - please don't go to the show if you wont sit through the final scene \"the nativity\". It's disgusting that people get up, pack their kids, bags, coats, etc and create such a rude distraction, and leave at this sacred part of the show- it's called a \"Christmas\" show for a reason. Leave us Christians at least one sacred moment in a time where we have been striped and compromised of so much of our faith!See the show- and deal with the rude people!"

The special effects were outstanding and the performances were excellent. The Rockettes were in exceptional form.

Radio City also has an interesting Backstage Tour where you get to meet one of the Rockettes and learn the history of the theater. And, they offer dance classes led by a Rockette as well. You can also get package deals with hotel, shows and other NYC attractions, which can be found on the Radio City website. It is a part of NY history that should not be missed."

The seats are actually quite comfortable considering the age of the theater, built in 1932.Something I noticed is that there doesn't appear to be any seats without a good or decent view of the stage. The theater appears very wide and the curve makes for nice viewing angles.I've been to many theaters in NYC over the past 20 years and this is one of the best laid out I've been to."

And what scenery! The props are amazing too. Totally entertaining and joyful. Planning to go again because seeing it once is not enough. Many things are in walking distance such as Port Authority, the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, Skating rink and Top of the Rock where you can walk around and view the city from the roof on top of the Rockefeller Center building, and Bryant Park where there are shops set up and a skating rink among other things right in the park. Central Park is not too far of a walk either. And of course there are restaurants galore in the area and many street food vendors. I highly recommend the traditional pretzels and roasted chestnuts."

This has become such a commercial business it sucked the joy of the Christmas spirit away from us. Long lines (even if you have a ticket) to get in. They inspect your bag and take away your water bottles so you can have the privilege of paying $5.50 for a 16-oz bottle of water once you are inside. Be ready to break the piggy bank once you are inside, especially if you have children along. Popcorn is $12, Candy is $8. The price of the tickets were bad enough but these prices are insane for a 1-1/2 hr show that was only about 30 min. of Rockettes & the rest so boring even the children around us were more interested in the toys they got in the lobby than what was on stage. This used to be a great show but not since it has become nothing but big business. Save your money for a real play the kids will remember."

First time was with my Mom when I was quite young....2nd time was with my Mom, Brother, and a bunch of students Chaperoning a trip. This time, I got to bring my wife, my daughter, my Mom, and two sisters....I couldn't have been happier.The line was extremely smooth getting in. It was crowded, but this is NY, not Texas. I was impressed with the flow they kept and how helpful the staff was in getting you where you need to go. I literally walked in with my family and smiled like a child in seeing the magnificence of even just the lobby area of the theatre.The theater was amazing, and the 2nd act is in 3D - so you get some 3D glasses on the way in. I tell you, I could reach out and touch everything....A big Canada Goose almost bit me ;)One of the things that I appreciated so much was that there were certain parts of the show that changed with the times (look out for the Freedom tower), but others are timeless, like the Toy Soldier Act and more importantly - the Living Nativity. It's not a 'slow' part of the show, by the way, it is the essence of Christmas. It is a beautiful part of the show and a live story of the Birth of Jesus...but that may not be for everyone...even if they do walk a 1/2 dozen live(stock) animals across the stage, including camels and sheep. (Look at a Nativity, you get the idea.)The Rockettes were flawless. I guess as you grow you learn a respect for the talent as well as the show....They were going at high gear at every appearance during the show. But Spoiler Alert*** They need phenomenal dancers for the in-between acts, just in case anyone is expecting to see the Rockettes dance for more than an hour an a half straight without a break. I just don't want to ruin anyone's expectations.This show has 'wowed' me for more than 25+ years....and since they said no \"flash photography\" and the tickets were deservingly expensive, I was one of those people taking pictures with my cell. I guess I could though....paying for tickets 14 rows from the stage in the Orchestra. Do not miss this experience....you may have to wait until next year at this point, but put it on your \"to do\" list!"

I worried that it might be too much dancing that might not hold a just 3 yr. old 's attention. She was fantastic- very attentive and excited as were the 11 yr. old twins. We were seated in the first mezzanine toward the back and the seats were great. All the kids could see very well and we were able to see the floor open periodically with new delights. Wise to get there early a line forms around the building those with tickets and those needing them. The line goes quickly if you have your tickets in advance. The show tickets are expensive but worth it saving for it. The dancing music and choreography is spectacular indeed. The live animals was a wonderful treat. Popcorn bucket I believe was $12.

Born and raised in NYC, I've only been to the Radio City Christmas Spectacular once when I was a teen with the family and once when my kids were young. This Christmas, as my Dad is entering his 80s, I've decided that this is one \"touristy\" thing that is worth reliving. It's hard to get Christmas presents for him when Dad says, I have enough clothes, food doesn't taste the same anymore. This is an \"experience\" gift. We caught the 9am show. Finding a parking spot in Midtown Manhattan early Sunday was relatively easy! The lines outside went quickly since most of the people had printed out tickets at home. The building is as I remember it in it's art deco glory. Things were restored and refreshed but I'm glad they kept the original look. The bathrooms are clean and I even remember the foot pedal hand dryer in the wall. There are working phone booths with the folding doors next to the ladies lounge! Photo op! The Christmas show itself was a bit different than what I remember. More lights and more use of the ceiling as a projector screen gave it a grander feel. The Rockettes are still the main attraction. Such precision and uniformity! Very impressive indeed. All the dance and song numbers were top notch. Needless to say, Dad was happy, humming along with the Christmas carolers on stage. I'd say that if it's been awhile that you've seen this show, go back again and have warm feelings again! It's the perfect show for first time visitors to NYC. Great for any age, lots of different scenes (my fav is the Nutcracker scene and the Nativity scene with the live animals)."

I was trying to get discounted tickets for the Rockettes Christmas Spectacular 5:00 matinee show but that time wasn't available at TKTS in Times Square. While starting to walk back to the hotel I stumbled upon two Radio City workers dressed in red Tin Soldier outfits handing out discount vouchers for the Rockettes show good \"today and tomorrow. Prices starting at $45\". I lined up at the Radio City box office at 3 pm that afternoon, presented the voucher and asked for the \"cheapest tickets for the 5:00 show\". They gave me seats at the 2nd level mezzanine for $45 each beside a couple (no voucher) who paid $70 per seat. The view was exactly what I wanted, far enough so I could see the whole action. The show was as entertaining as described by the other viewers."

After being sent to the wrong seats and the ensuing confusion with the usher we were sent to the right seats and just caught the opening act. After 20 minutes a large family of 10 came in and were seated behind us. Ok, not too bad. But as soon as they were settled out came their dinner. Oh yes, why bother eating before the show when you're allowed a family meal on the first mezzanine of the music hall. The same family talked through the performance with no official interruption. We were interrupted though...... twice. Someone had left the show leaving their bag behind, mid row and we were asked halfway through the performance for her bag. Never saw a lady leave. The usher left. Only to return 5 minutes later for a bag under a seat. It had been there from a previous showing. The show itself was good. Only ruined by takeaway bags rustling, coercing children to eat and constant talking from behind. Heaven forbid I'd try to take my SLR in there and not dropped it off at my hotel first though."

I wish everything in America worked as precisely as the Rockettes dance, it would be a much better country. Their sets, costumes and especially their dancing are terrific. I'm already planning on seeing their new Spring Spectacular in a few months. As an added bonus is the beauty of Radio City Music Hall itself. They don't make theaters like this one anymore. The chandelier in the lobby is worth the price of admission. Do yourself a favor and go see the show - you won't be disappointed. And while you're in the neighborhood, pop around the corner to see the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral on 5th Avenue, both delightful. Even Scrooge could get in the holiday spirit roaming around this area. Merry Christmas, everyone!"

However, much of it you have seen on TV shows, parades, etc before. The big finale (Snow) was not as awesome as hyped. My daughter like the multiple Santas dance the best and I like the one with the NY bus and going through the city (it really played with your eyes/mind) and the Nativity scene. Yes, you can meet a Rockette ( I assume she is a substitute since she is there up until curtain up and immediately after the show) before the show, but you cannot take a photo on your own camera. If you want to purchase your photo, the cheapest \"package\" is $35. They do give you a \"free\" program and 3-d glasses that are needed for 1 song. Other souveniers are able to be purchased. The ornaments start at $32. My 7 year old liked it and it was a 90 minute show (straight through - no intermission) which was an appropriate length of time. Buy the best seat with the cheapest price you can afford. We sat in the mezzanine in the center close to the back and saw the show well. Wished we were on the floor so we could have seen a little closer and had the snow fall on us. You can take photos during the show without flash."

Before the show began 2 organs came out of either side of the theater (from behind curtains) and played dueling carols. Not hi-tech at all, but they organists were real showmen and I can imagine something like their little concert being done in the 30's when this first started. Later they threw in 3-D, an excellent ballerina, and of course, the Rockettes. The only thing missing was a really show-stopping singer. Now that I have seen, and thoroughly enjoyed the show, I would not want to return every year, as some people do. I'm more of a enjoy it once type of person. Note- The snacks are outrageously over priced ($26 for 2 drinks and a popcorn). I'd coach kids that snacks would NOT be part of the experience."

The Theater really is beautiful if you get a chance to look around. They say to arrive early, which does make sense however they don't open the doors until one hour before the show. Even if you already have tickets, you will be standing in line outside. Once they start moving people in, I have to say it went quick. The show starts exactly on time, no intermission and it's about 90 minutes. The show was very nice. We had seats in the 2nd mezzanine, Row BB, the section all the way to the left facing the stage.We were in the second row. The seats were very good I have to say. I got a deal on the tickets through Groupon and I'm glad. I would not have paid full price for the show. It was nice, but not worth a full price ticket. When you exit the show, it's a little crazy. People are everywhere taking pictures. You can have your picture taken with a Rockette, but prices start at $35 and go up to $100. The prices are not listed anywhere. I went to the desk and asked. If you go downstairs, Santa is there and you can take a pic also. Not sure how much they are. Once you leave the theater, you can't go back in, so get all your pictures, etc done before you leave."

The show had a lot of electronics added to it since I last saw it and it was a wonderful show for all ages. The music is sensational and the dancers beautiful with such precision. There were other performers in the show also and they were all excellent. Highly recommend."

We had seats in the first mezzanine and had a great view of the whole stage. Although an announcement was made prior to the start of the show that \"no flash photography\" was to take place, the woman sitting next to me (and one other in the whole theatre) apparently couldn't comprehend what that meant! I even told her, and she took a few more pictures anyway or handed her phone and/or camera to her daughter who was sitting next to her to take the picture. So, even though she was an adult, she didn't know how to \"follow the rules\". She was annoying and, although I looked around for a staff member to tell her to stop, there was not one inside the theater (by the door). The show was \"SPECTACULAR\"! It was everything I thought it would be and MORE! And, the staff who were outside, prior to the doors opening up for the 4:30 p.m. performance, were just terrific! They got everyone lined up and had our tickets scanned, so when the doors did open, everyone filed in in an orderly fashion. The staff have this down to a science, and should be commended for their hard work and patience with getting the masses of people into the theatre! A show of a lifetime! Thank you to all involved in putting on this amazing Holiday Performance!! Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to everyone!"

Great performance to keep little ones engaged. The 3-D effects were wonderful. I do wish they had more bathrooms! Make sure you go before you even enter radio city music hall. Lines were long in the beginning and we almost missed the opening. However if you sneak out during the performance there are virtual no lines for anything. Souvenirs were expensive as well as concession. But worth it. I also thought the nativity scene performance was beautiful and well done. Would recommend this show to anyone!"

Great 3D opener. 90 minutes just flew by. Never seen the Rockettes before and they were so well rehearsed - didn't put a foot wrong. We were on the 2nd mez which worked out at 1/2 the price of the Orchestra seats and in our opinion gave us a far better view of the action. Thought at first it was just going to be a show for kids but was way wrong. Money well spent - and we didn't get wet !!"

We bought tickets for 3 and we were literally 3 rows from the stage, hoping that we can see things more clearly as it presented right before our eyes from the stage.I am in my early 30's and the music was way to loud for me, with the poorly designed music channeling, everything is hooked up with a speaker.We seat in the center and the base is crazily loud and there were some notes that was just really loud. I think it has to do with how they channel the music and they really don't need to put speakers right off the stage. Instead they can locate them on the side and on the back too where people are far from the stage and it would make the best use of them.The performance was great you get to see all the kicking and dancing very clearly. We have been going to ballets and symphonys and not used to speaker musics from stage performance, and that takes away of most of the enjoyment.Otherwise it is a fun thing to see with the kid as we just watched the ballet nutcracker the day prior to this.There is no down time in this show which is perfect for kids like mine who needs constant excitements for them to sit still.Probably won't do it again, once is enough. The show was great but we all live in NY and just think it is a great holiday kid thing to do.People there treats you like a piece of rock from the floor."

The show is one and half hour long. The 3D show with Santa, the stage, the props, the lighting effects, the orchestra are just so impressive. The choreography of performers, specially the Rocketts are so flawless! I just wish they let people take photos while the performers are on the stage for a couple of minutes at the end of show - for souvenirs. There's a photo booth outside where they will take picture of you with one of the Rockettes, very pricey though (a couple of printed photos with digital copy will cost you $70, $50 if you prefer digital copy only). I did not see the price posted anywhere, it's somewhat of a tourist trap I think. They should be upfront with the pricing by posting it around where it is visible so the people will not waste their time falling in line to ask how much and they will also save their staffs' trouble explaining the pricing scheme."

My wife has always wanted to see the Radio City Christmas Spectacular so we planned early and purchased tickets for a Sunday matinee. The overall experience was simply wonderful. We arrived early as recommended, and gained entrance fairly quickly. The interior of the Music Hall was decorated for Christmas, with Santa Claus available for pictures, as well as a Radio City Rockette. We were able to purchase a glass of wine and walk around the facility. We had purchased orchestra seats, wanting to ensure we had a good view of the stage. After visiting the first balcony, we discovered that the views from that location may in fact have provided a better view. One of the friendly ushers confirmed that fact, stating that even from the last row the views were very good. The show itself was extremely enjoyable. The music and dance sequences were very professionally performed with a live orchestra and organists. Lastly, the Rockettes were simply incredible. The variety of routines they performed were intricate and spot on. The costumes were impressive as well. Of course I cannot forget the finale which is the live Nativity scene, with live camels, donkeys and sheep. It was an emotional ending to an incredible show. Overall, it was a wonderful afternoon. One of the other guests sitting behind us advised that he comes every year, and the show always changes. I suspect that we will be visiting New York again during the Holidays next year, with tickets to Radio City at the top of the list."

We wanted to get into the Xmas spirit early so we bought tickets for late Nov.We had kids ages 7 and 14.Our tickets were middle section EE. These seemed awesome as they are close to the stage.Once the show started we realized if we were further back we wouldnt have to keep looking behind us or to the right/left sides.I would recmd Orchestra center section 400or either side section 300 or 500Best seats in my opinion are MM-ZZThe Rockettes were amazing. I would suggest going every 3 years.We attended 4 years ago and felt we spaced it out perfectly.The show does not change much so every year could be over kill.Afterwards we got coffee and cupcakes at Magnolia Bakery. This was within walking distance.Coffee/Tea/Chai?Hot Chocolates all were delicious and hit the spot!"

When visiting New York City in November we were pleasantly surprised to find that the famous Radio City Rockettes were presenting their CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR. And we were able to get same-day tickets that ended up being in the front row. This was really great at my mother is visually challenged. The show was truly spectacular - I would highly recommend it to everyone. It would be especially fun for families with children."

I've always wanted to see the Rocketts at the Radio City Music Hall so this time around, given that it was November and I had my husband and 5 year old son with me, I booked us in to see the Christmas Spectacular. We loved it. My son's mouth was agape the whole way through the show. Our seats were first row in the first mezzanine and they were perfect. Close enough to really see the show and with nobody in front to block the view. The foyer and hall were both beautiful and with the snow falling outside, it just made the whole evening feel so Christmassy. I'd definitely recommend attending this show if you have kids. It's magical."

If the Rockettes are coming to your community during this Christmas season, beg, borrow, or steal the money for the tickets. Its been 8 years since they were last in Houston. At that rate I figured my granddaughter would be 20 and away at college, and my grandson would be 12 and just not into the kick line.The little one was not able to go - flu. My granddaughter and her friend were mesmerized. I spent most of the performance with tears in my eyes with nostalgia. I just know the little guy would have loved the Toy Soldiers on Parade and the dancing Santas. Give yourself a treat to see the glow and excitement in the eyes of your special loved ones.."

The costumes, sets, lighting, special effects, and performances (both the Rockettes and other cast members) are top-notch. If you are in New York during the Christmas season, absolutely go see them. Each production number leaves you wondering what could possibly top what you just saw--(ice skaters, bus, toy soldiers, dancing bears?), then you see the next number, and, voila! The show's climax is the nativity scene which was so beautiful, I actually cried. It is probably one of my most favorite shows ever (and I go to a LOT of shows)."

The building and architecture of the building alone is worth the price of admission. We went to see the Rockettes Christmas show and it was really impressive. We had seats in the Mezzanine with a great view of the stage. I think the tix were $59 each and probably the best money I've spent when we were visiting NY. There were around 75 people lined up along the street when we arrived to get in and we never waited longer than 5 min to get into the building. Not sure how long the show was, probably an hour or hour and a half, but very entertaining from start to finish. The Rockettes are worth seeing if you're a first time visitor. I really think this should be rated much higher on the NYC attraction list."

For this visit we purchased tickets before leaving the UK and had prime seats for one of the evening shows.The dancers timing is so precise and fabulous to watch as well as stunning scenery with great effects at different stages of the show. You must also remember to wear the 3D glasses to get the impression of the sleigh going over your head or snowballs/flakes flying through the air towards you.

As an older adult I don't like the super loud music that is common today. I did enjoy the 3D part complete with glasses with Santa and sleigh riding right to me and snow flakes it would seem I could reach out and grab. The segment on the city tour used to be a low point but now with computerized backgrounds it was a highlight. The Nutcracker segment was familiar and fun. the Rockettes continue to amaze with their perfect synchronizations and I couldn't count the number of costume changes they did which had to create a chaotic scene back stage!I see there are many discount coupons out there most of which seem to expire Dec 15. search for Radio City Christmas Spectacular Promo Code.The 2 organs playing in sync from each side of the theater before the show was impressive.If you found this review helpful please note below and consider adding this reminder to your own reviews.

If the fantastic decor of the Radio City Music Hall with its grand ceilings and beautiful festive details takes your breathe away, then you'll love the show inside! Whether you are old or young this show is sure to put you in the Christmas spirit! Kids will love the costumes the singing and the beautiful, mesmerizing effects (including 3D!!) and adults are bound to be impressed by the perfection and precision of The Rockettes synchronized dancing! I'm 21 and have been to many shows including the ballet, opera, musicals, plays serious and silly.. and this is by FAR the best one yet! Every single part is perfectly done and done with such passion and flair that I have sworn to return every single year! A MUST in New York City!"

We all as an adult family, just beamed with pleasure for 90 minutes.Well worth the \u00a3100 or so it cost and better value than the Broadway show we went to see too.Hey I love the way you get a programme free with US theatre productions. London should adopt that for the huge prices we pay there too!We would have gone to see the Radio City production again across the 5 days we were in NYC its that good. Perhaps the management should do a pay full price for one attendance and then offer a see it again price at say 40% of the original. But if they fill all performances and theres 3 a day then they would not be bothered about discounting the prices!!"

No matter what age you are it's a great show to get you into the Christmas spirit and is well worth going to see. For the best up close view I would suggest sitting in the orchestra within the first 20 - 25 rows. If you want to see the dancing formations from up top I would suggest the mezzanine. My only complaint is that there were no \"flashing lights\" or announcement to signal the show was starting and to take your seats. We were mindful of the time and got to our seats just before the show started after checking out everything in the lobby. However, many other people were still in line for souvenirs or snacks which resulted in a lot of people coming to find their seats after the show had started. Not huge deal, but was distracting and a little annoying."

My husband and I decided to go to this show on our annual NYC trip instead of our usual Broadway show, partly because I didn't feel like paying hundreds of dollars to see The Book of Mormon, but mostly because I remembered seeing this show many years ago as a child and loving it. We got great seats in Mezzanine 1. The show is a joy from start to finish. The sense of excitement was obvious with the crowd even out on the street.We were handed Santa hats as we went in the door. The lobby was gorgeous, with a Christmas Tree chandelier covered with thousands of crystals, and of course all the beautiful Art Deco details that are like nowhere else.The show was wonderful! The Rockettes are so very amazing, all the same height, with their beautiful long legs, happy faces and unbelievable timing. My husband said over and over, \"how do they DO that?\" And he was the one who was really only going to the show to humor me.The show was approximately 90 minutes, with no intermission. We happily drank our bad wine from the bar (my one suggestion - stock a better wine for $10). The show is designed to touch the child in all of us. The costumes were amazing, and a full orchestra and two organists added so much to the show. The sets were beautiful and quite visionary. In the Nativity segment (yes, they actually did a whole Nativity number with quotes from the Bible, surprising in this day of political correctness and I say more power to them for that, it was enchanting) we thought we were seeing a film of camels and donkeys projected on a screen. It wasn't until we were outside later and saw the animal trailer that we realized they were real animals!In short, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves from start to finish, sang along with all the songs, even my husband, and highly recommend this show. If you can't go this year, go next year! Radio City had always put on a first-rate show and this year it was superb."

Our ticket information suggested we arrive at Radio City one hour before show time in order to check out decorations and photo opportunities before the show. They did not open the doors until 40 minutes before the show - 20 precious minutes later than what they advertise. We were only in the city for 12 hours so that time could have been spent more wisely elsewhere. Once we were allowed inside, we were herded into a massive hall where it was too packed to move. The doors to the theatre remained closed so we were at the mercy of the crowd. There was no possible way anyone could take pictures or pose around the hall. The hall itself is beautiful and the show was fantastic. One other complaint was that they continued to let people into the theatre during the first four acts of the show. It was noisy and we couldn't see overtop of the massive amounts of people still trying to find their seats. I've never been to anything else in NYC where this has been an issue. Due to this we weren't really able to get into the show until everyone was seated by act 5. I am glad we got to see the Rockette's - definitely something everyone should do sometime during their lifetime."

At ninety minutes without an intermission the show was about the right length but it would be wise to arrive early as there were throngs of people scrambling to get to their seats.

Popcorn and a drink were included in our group tickets, but I didn't buy any other souvenirs so I can't comment on that process or cost. Overall, we were all pleased with the performance and experience as a group."

This was my first time seeing the Rockettes and I was impressed with the quality of their holiday production. Everything was terrific - we especially enjoyed their amazingly synchronized dancing, dazzling costumes and creative staging. Additionally, the staff were incredibly kind and helpful. My mother was in a wheelchair and they went out of their way to ensure she was well taken care of. The experience put all of us in a wonderful holiday state of mind."

The Rockettes are amazing at what they do and it was great to see a full range of their dancing abilities.

Neither of us had ever been so we went even though it was on a weekday morning at 11:00 am. We walked up about 40-45 mins early and easily got through the ticket holders line. You cannot bring any drinks inside, just FYI you must finish them or throw them away. The seats were comfortable and the show seemed to start on time. It is non-stop for nearly 90 mins. Fortunately, there were only 2 people in the entire 4 rows in front of us which made it easier to watch the show. Unfortunately, we were both a bit sick and the show wasn't as easy to enjoy with clogged sinuses, etc. Choreography is fantastic, it was a bit more kid oriented than I expected not knowing what to expect. There was a 3D part early on that was neat where you are flying through the city, they provide glasses. We sat in the 2nd Orchestra section off to one side and the view was fine, would be better from the middle of course. It was the least cramped seating I have experienced in the local places like when I saw The Addams Family, Mamma Mia! and Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark. I'd definitely return to this location."

Whatever you may envision as the ultimate Christmas holiday show, The Christmas Spectacular at Radio City will far exceed your expectations. Utilizing amazing visual and technical capabilities and covering every conceivable aspect of Christmas, this show is a must-see if you are visiting the city at this time if year. Do you think about the nativity? About rag dolls and tin soldiers? About the excitement of Christmas in N.Y.? Or Santa's workshop? Or scenes from the Nutcracker? Can you imagine a creatively stunning experience that covers it all and more, accompanied by a full orchestra and a talented cast of singers and dancers along with the perfect synchronization of the Rockettes? From a 3-D ride on Santa's sleigh, to fireworks, to huge snowflakes that float out over the audience, the show is a jaw dropping WOW from the time it starts to the closing scenes, leaving you to ask, \"How do they do it?\" and planning when you can come back again."

It was flawless throughout and when the toy soldiers did their routine, it was awesome. There was a segment near the beginning where we had to put on the 3D glasses they had given us. That was fun.We bought our six tickets for the upper level in the third row back. We were all happy that we sat there because the show was action packed and if we had've been in the lower levels, I think that some of the view would have been missed. So...by all means, purchase those balcony seats and enjoy the show. More expensive may not be the best seats here.The 4 and 7 year old children with us were mesmerized the whole time. The Santa routine was especially enjoyed by them.Loved it all. Thanks alot for the memories!!"

Not only did the Rockettes do a wonderful job, but Santa Clause narrated the show and there was ballet, march of the toy soldiers, and great music. While we adults really enjoyed the show, the kids around us also had a wonderful time. It is about an hour and three quarters long, with several show times. Lots of fun for all."

Yes, it's a bit pricey, but it was a visual treat worth every cent. It wasn't too crowded, we got great seats. The Rockettes are on stage for most of the show, and how they remember all those dance routines and have all that energy is beyond me. They are consumate performers with astonishing talent. Some of the routines are new, but many are the traditional ones you expect, and don't fail to delight everyone. (They had a video game portion, which they could have left out, but kids seemed to enjoy it.) Even though were were all adults, we all left with smiles on our faces. Like all the great Christmas traditions, if we are in NYC for any part of the season, we will go back. Don't miss this - seriously, it is such a New York Christmas event that you will be sorry you didn't go."

Using Groupon does limit your options both in date of show and seating, but for me the trade off was worth it. (My boys (9 and 7)not so much. I think closer to Christmas might have made it better for them. The 9 year old rated the performance 3.5 out of 5. They were just as impressed with the Toys R Us on Times Square!) We sat in the Orchestra level along the side, if you buy tickets here get as close to the center aisle as possible. I was right on the aisle and the very left part of the stage was cut off. No big deal really, you don't miss much. The show itself is wonderful, lots of old standards presented in a new way. The 3-D portion is really well done and adds depth to the stage show. The lighting is great, the orchestra ( a full live orchestra) is fantastic and of course the dancing is impeccable: these are the Rockettes! If you are visiting from out of town this is a must see. Note: you can not bring any food or drinks in , bags are checked and we had to throw away some bottles of water.All in all this is a great show."

The show was amazing. It was worth the trip from Boston. We were in the first row of the Mez. and they were spectacular seats. Colorful, beautiful music, Santa, and a 3D show that made it so much fun. Little children came in there Christmas outfits. All in all it was so worth it. My favorite part was the Rocketts. They are true althetes in dance. The precision!! I don't want to spoil it but the end brings the glory and marvel of the season to life. Just check out the real life animals on stage. Merry Christmas even if its early it gets you into the wonders of Christmas.....Only complaint is the bathrooms. Long long lines so go early....We went early. The theater is beautiful inside and we wanted to explore. We found at the 51st entrance a back stage tour. We took it. It was about an hour. It took you to the back scenes of the building, not the stage. You did see the private box of Rockie, a private lounge and met with a Rockette. It was very interesting. They told a lot about the history of the building and the shows that were held at Radio City. I would not take young people they may find it a bit boring but we enjoyed it (50 somethings). There are stairs to climb."

The tickets can get expensive as you get closer to Christmas so try to get tickets in November or get weekday tickets. Try going to coupon sites to get promo codes where you can get good discounts (I managed to get tickets for $39.5 for a Sunday performance). Ticketemaster fees are very high but you can avoid them if you get tickets at the Radio City box office. Orchestra level seats are good if you are close to the stage and in the middle, the back seats are rather far away so you might as well get the first mezzanine which is good since it overhangs the orchestra seats.Parking is always hard to find around the holidays so avoid it by taking public transportation or try parkwhiz or get there early where parking lots have $25 deals for 4 hour parking."

Their were many children and elderly guests caught in the pushing. As the band began to play, the majority of guests were still attempting to get to their seats and the pushing worsened. We arrived at our seats on the main floor just after the ROCKETTES took the stage. For the next 15 minutes, views were interrupted as guests found their seats.

The lights, sound. Even the ceiling comes alive. The rockettes precision is incredible. Ignore the messages saying it's for children. It's not - 2/3rds or more of audience were/are adults. You don't have to be a kid for the magic of Christmas to shine through in this show and touch your heart. It made our last night in New York a perfect end and left is with a wonderful memory. Don't miss it."

Countless red carpet film first has occurred here and every christmas there is a spectacular produced with at least 5 shows daily with legendary performers .The hall itself is decorated with past era grandeur and lots of glitz that make it a great phot ops study. I remember as a child being taken here for the holiday show and loving all of the noise, colors and people that abound here. Tourists routinely take tours through the vast hall and you can sometimes see the animals with their trainers hovering outside the 51st street stage door waiting to perform. An amazing place that should be visited while in the city."

I've been there for the finale of the America's Got Talent and for a Backstage Tour. The building was recently restored, and both the stage and the building are amazing.The Backstage Tour was informative and interesting for the most part. Unfortunately, they don't allow any video, and there's not a chance to remember all the info they give you. It was still educational and entertaining. There were a couple of problems with the tour though. First of all, it doesn't really go \"backstage\". Yes, it goes to some areas not normally accessible to public, but really it just goes through a few hallways with pictures - that's about it. You don't really go to the areas that the acts use to come on stage, or get to see the hydraulics that operate the stage. I've done Bally's Jubilee backstage tour in Vegas, and that was totally different - you got to go backstage and see how all the props worked, etc. So from that perspective the Radio City tour totally failed. Another really annoying thing about the backstage tour was that while you got to meet a take a picture with one of the Rockettes, they didn't let you use your own camera and charged you $22 for the picture they took! That's in addition to the $25/person admission tickets. I always find that kind of nickel and diming disgusting. OK, you charged me $25 for an hour of a tour of mostly public areas. Fine. But then you won't even let me even take a picture with my own camera? Again, to compare this with a Bally's Jubilee tour, there you got to take a picture with a showgirl fro Jubilee. Actually, the showgirl was your tour guide. And I believe those tickets were only $15/person last year.Taping of America's Got Talent was fun but very poorly organized. We had to wait in line twice - once to exchange the tickets for the vouchers, and once to actually get it. And that was a several-hour line, mind you. However, the worst part of the whole thing were the disgustingly rude security guards. They treated people like cattle, yelling at people, herding people, etc. That really detracted from the experience. I've heard many times that New Yorkers are ruder than folks in other area of the US, but Radio City Music Hall security guards were definitely some of the rudest people I ever had to deal with. Totally nasty.So if you decide to spend your time on seeing a show or doing the backstage tour, I hope this review helps you to set your expectations right. It is an amazingly beautiful building with rude people working there that will nickel and dime you to death."

I attended a Rockette's performance at Radio City Music Hall with my parents a couple of years ago, via a bus trip from RI, and unfortunately, we were not aware that the date and time we picked was the same date and time for the Rockefeller Tree Lighting. We opened the side door to exit the Music Hall to get out into the street, and there were hordes and hordes of people on every side street and main street around the area. We literally had to hold hands to try to get back to the bus that was waiting for us, pushing our way through and trying not to get trampled. It was as I'd imagine it is on New Year's in Times Square, an experience that personally I would avoid at all costs. So good performance, fun to do once, but DO NOT do it when there is another big event in the city. We were lucky to make it back to the bus on time--several people did not."

I had been there for the NFL draft but never quite felt it was a beautiful theater. probably because it was crowded with football fans. back to the tour. The give you a history of the theater and it's inner workings the architecture is Art Deco and it is grand. The technology is up to date even thought some it is the original. You meet a rocket the and take in the history. Some of the views inside are breathtaking. It is well worth the hour of your time. Also the bathrooms are from a more elegant era when theaters were almost like cruise ships"

Even if you can't make a show, I would recommend taking the tour or at least stopping by outside for a great photo opportunity.My only hint of caution would be that on our most recent trip, security at the entrance tried to stop us from taking in our DSLR camera that we had been using for pictures throughout the city. They said it was a professional camera and couldn't enter. They offered to check it, but I wasn't comfortable leaving such an expensive item with them. After talking for a few minutes they agreed to let it in, as long as we didn't take pictures during the performance. I would suggest leaving the DSLR at home and taking the point and shoot."

The first was seeing \"Christmas Spectacular\" on a trip to Midtown Manhattan when she was in 2nd grade. The weather was rainy, but it didn't dampen our spirits. We chose premier seating since my niece was with us. It was so great to be up close and personal with what was happening on stage. It is a beautiful auditorium. Being closer kept my niece's attention on the action. The 2nd visit was with adults. We found out then, that all seats are good, and that it is nice to see the action a little further back so that you feel the experience that is being created for you, rather than seeing them create the experience for you closer to the front. Without a doubt, I would return to Radio City Music Hall for other performances. I live in Ohio, so I pack my NEW YORK-Midtown/Theatre visits with as much as I can possibly do. I <3 NYC."

The d\u00e9cor of the Hall is elegant and beautiful and the seating is leaps and bounds in comfort and roominess over traditional New York theater seating, with every seat perfectly angled so no one gets a bad view. And the sound...the sound quality of this venue is amazing. The voices stay crystal clear, while the music is studio clean and free of any echos or unintended feedback. Simply perfect. The dancers, well, what can be said?!? They're the Rockettes; the pride of NYC. And like RCMH, they should be."

The Radio City musical hall currently stages the magnificent Christmas spectacular every year between Nov and Dec featuring them, Santa Claus, secondary singers and dancers,and now 3D glasses which you can keep.Radio City musical hall is decked out in an art deco style. During the holiday season they have two grand Wurlitzer organs playing before the show starts.Although they have touring companies of the Rockettes there is no better place to see the full line than at Radio City. Known for their famous unison \"kick\" they dance with precision and delight audiences of all ages.Each year they change a couple of musical numbers but their famous dances including the 12 days of Christmas, the Nutcracker, the Wooden Soldiers dance complete with the cannon \"shooting\" the line where they all \"fall back\" on each other are still intact. They also show a glorious finale production of the Nativity reminding the audience about what Christmas is all about.They normally do 4-5 shows per day due to the short season but is long enough for children and adults alike to enjoy a wonderful stage show with great computer backdrops to use your 3D glasses.I'll never tire of them. They make the visit so worthwhile."

Talk about defying gravity: her voice alternately exploded, whispered, belted and soared, taking the audience on an incredible ride throughout the evening. Having risen to fame on Broadway for her amazing voice in \"Rent\", then moving on to originate the role of the wicked witch in \"Wicked\", and currently in the cutting edge musical \"If/Then\", she performed songs from all of those productions. She is also the voice of Elsa in the animated Disney movie \"Frozen\" so of course she had to do \"Let It Go\" the current top 10 hit song from that film. In addition to performing a wide range of songs with an incredible orchestra behind her, she had a lot of fun entertaining the audience. It is magic when an artist of such vocal talents can laugh at herself, and Idina proved to be magical. Her on-stage costume change in lieu of an intermission - complete with wardrobe malfunction - was hilarious. As opposed to her memorable Broadway performances where she must stay in character, here Idina broke down that 4th wall with a wrecking ball and endeared herself to the audience. Her between-song patter was alternately bawdy and sweet. Anyone who might not have been a fan before the show was most certainly a fan walking out the door."

The theatre itself is very comfortable with good big seats and plenty of legroom.If I was back at this time of year again, it would be my guilty pleasure though!"

Buying tickets on-line and collecting them pre-performance was straightforward, and we enjoyed a drink on the balcony overlooking the huge Christmas tree(as we were there just pre-Thanksgiving, these were the only Christmas decorations to be seen in the whole city). The place was full of kids of course -. not to our taste, but then it was a family show! The performance was very well done, we enjoyed the Rockettes' well-drilled routines and came out feeling we'd had a good time. A bit tacky, but nice and Christmassy. Give it a go!"

The experience started with a long queue that involved picking up the tickets I purchased online at a discount back in early October from will call. Despite having already paid it was quite the line. As the show time approached the queue moved quick and security began instructing there be only one person from each party in the ticket pickup part of the line.Once inside I was caught by what a spectacular appearance the place had. We first headed up the stairs to the second floor. As some members of our party were using the toilet I found a great photo opportunity with my daughter. We were overlooking the place from the second floor and there was a nice chandelier, with views of the crowd and the Christmas decorations. That was about all we did though for exploring the outer area but I got some great photos.We then headed to our orchestra seats which were accessed from the lower level. We were handed a program and 3D glasses. My mother as flipping through the program says \u201cOMG, this is the show with the rockettes. She was mostly NYC green but when she then said \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this since I was a teenager when my Grandfather took me\u201d, this made my day. I had never been this show but I remember the family next door as I was a child going every year and looking up online I knew it had a long history. The fact my mother had some history with it too added to the anticipation.The show itself far exceeded all expectations. The Santa part of the show, the overall story, the skit with rockettes as toy soldiers, the Macys part etc. were all awesome. We were totally in the Christmas spirit when this was done. Including my sister who had normally been a mini-grinch but starting with this to our experience at FAO Schwarz (which I\u2019ll add a review for soon) the following night, to some interaction with needy, then to our actual Christmas with our family her heart that was two sizes too small toward Christmas grew to the size of ten grinches. Story book analogies aside, I had a wonderful Christmas and this show was the start that helped set the mood."

Lots of vendors inside but they all sell the same plastic garbage, nothing nice that you would want to display in your home. The show is amazing and has to be done at least once in your life."

The whole experience was exceedingly rushed. There was very little time to get from the pens on the sidewalk to our seats on the balcony, Some of the children didn't get the 3D glasses as they entered and they were barely seated before the show started. Ours was an evening show and I believe there were five shows on the particular day we attended. I trust that the Rockettes were on some sort of comfort roster but I couldn't help but feel that the audience should also have been treated to a less frenetic experience."

First if all, our guide, Alvin, was a wealth of knowledge. Secondly the history of this magnificent theater built in 1932, was fascinating. Thirdly, if you are looking for authentic Art Deco period furnishings, this place is a must see. Even the bathrooms have original sinks, etc. It takes you back in time, when life was a little more glamorous and refined. They encourage photography, so we were happy to snap away. Great hour of history and money well spent. Oh, and you get a chance to talk and ask questions of a Rockette, which was icing on the cake. Take the tour."

Having seen Radio City Music Hall's Christmas Spectacular three times in the last fifteen years, the most recent being Christmas Day, 2013, I can honestly say the word to describe this musical is \"spectacular.\" To me it is the best of both the secular and sacred showcasing the precision chorus line dancing and choreographic artistry of the incredible Rockettes. From holiday music on dual pipe organs before the opening curtain, to toy soldiers falling in domino effect, to a ride on Santa's sleigh, to the holiday sing-along, to the majestic pageant complete with camels creating the solemn Nativity scene, we see the world of Christmas. An integral part of this production is state-of-the-art technology, the lighting, sound, staging, even 3-D flows smoothly from scene to scene. The variety of costumes, scenery and musical arrangements from the marvelous orchestra evokes wonder in me. I particularly enjoyed the creative dancing in The Twelve Days of Christmas and the wonderfully convincing Santa. All of this happens in Rockefeller's beautiful 1932 Radio City Music Hall that seats 6,000 within the spacious half-dome auditorium that becomes a kaleidoscope of color and mood changes. To have a panoramic view of the immense stage and orchestra, I recommend sitting in the mezzanine. Expensive? Yes. But to see the best of the best in cast and production, I'm thrilled to attend and encourage you to experience the Christmas Spectacular at least once in your life."

We had good seats in the middle of the row on the mezzanine. The theatre has a curved ceiling and walls which are used to good effect for projecting snowflakes etc onto. I liked the dual theatre organs. I also liked the 3D projection (they hand out 3D glasses) which was a cool aspect of the show. There were several really good parts of the show for example a double decker bus which turned on the stage when the projected street-scene background moved past creating the effect that the bus was really driving. My wife and daughter both loved how Christmassy the show was. We loved the nativity scene which highlighted the real reason for Christmas. I am 6'6\" tall and the seat rows were too close together with my knees aching at the end of the show. The Rockettes' synchronisation was flawless. The Toy Soldiers falling over was good but went on too long. I decided to write this review because my enjoyment of the show was mediocre despite most reviews on Trip Advisor indicating that whilst a lot of people thought it might be a bit cheesy before going they really enjoyed it despite their misgivings. Well, I went with high hopes but found it very cheesy. Advice: only go for the kids."

I think there were about 15 people in front of us and we waited 45 minutes for a ticket booth, very bad organisation and there were no indication as to ticket prices. We see a lot of shows in the UK so are prepared that tickets can cost as much as \u00a380 per person. So when the gentleman at the ticket booth said seats in the stalls or tier above were $160 each we nearly laughed at him. And for $95-$105 we could get tickets so far back they'd normally cost about \u00a320-\u00a330 in the uk. We decided to give it a miss. I'm sure the Christmas spectacular is great but we don't work hard all year for those prices. Radio City Music Hall would benefit from a better queuing system and I assume a quicker booking system."

I loved the show and would definitely go again and plan to take grandson when he's older as well as daughter. I think the show is tailored for all ages and well worth the price. Very talented actors/actresses and dancers; they are professional and it shows. The show lasted about two hours and the time just flew. There are stairs to climb inside the bldg..

If you go to New York you have to see this show. 90 minutes, no intermissions, be sure to take that restroom break ahead of time."

            "review": "Fantastic venue, talented performers, lacklustre production. We'd read some phenomenal reviews of Radio City, and so we just had to go there while we were in New York. The Christmas Spectacular was playing during the time we were there, so that's the one we went to.The venue is enormously impressive. It's a gorgeous Art Deco building (I'm a huge fan of this genre) and is properly big inside too. We went for some of the cheaper seats, but even from the top tier at the back the view was perfectly acceptable. The orchestra pit and the various mechanics of the stage were engineered and used very impressively too.Before the performance started we were entertained by two Wurlitzer organists, which was pleasant enough, and then we were into the song and dance show. That, frankly, is where it all started to go a bit pear shaped.Unsurprisingly the music was all Christmas themed - great stuff, no problem there. The problem was, though, that the choreographer seemed to have got bored halfway through writing each of the numbers (and, for that matter, the show as a whole). Take \"The 12 Days of Christmas\", for example: as they worked up the numbers we had appropriate numbers of dancers dancing to each number (five girls for the gold rings, one for the partridge - you get the idea) but then when they got to about seven or eight they seemed to stop counting (I don't recall the song mentioning \"an arbitrary number of pipers piping\", for instance) and the numbers stopped corresponding.The dancers did seem to be very talented. They clearly knew what they were doing, and the parts of the show that were decently choreographed were extremely well performed. Sadly, I found the choreography unimaginative (the mantra seemed to be: \"if in doubt, get a line of girls to do some high-kicking\") and it didn't really seem to do the performers justice.As the show neared its end, I realised there was something I'd forgotten about that was mentioned at the beginning: namely a request to behave in a way that wouldn't frighten the animals. How did I realise this? Simple: just when you thought they were lining up for a big, final number ... WHAM - an impromptu nativity play was conjured up. With sheep. Real sheep. Real, bored-looking sheep (well behaved, mind you). I did an amazing job of restraining myself from giggling at the sheer surrealism of it all, but then the woman behind me started and I just couldn't help myself. And then came the camels - also on their best behaviour, it should be said. I found myself gazing into the eyes of one of them, thinking: \"What on earth are you doing there?\"; he had that look of: \"Dunno, mate, I've been here every night for a fortnight and I've not figured it out yet\". I seem to recall that there was a donkey in there too, but he was very much a bit-part actor bringing up the rear. At least it was a change from yet another high-kicking line, I suppose.I know lots of people have enjoyed the Radio City show: we chose it because of the great reviews it got on TripAdvisor, after all. I just found it really disappointing, that's all. It had the potential to be brilliant, but a group of dancers who I strongly suspect are talented (and an orchestra whose members clearly are) were let down by lacklustre production, unimaginative choreography and a complete lack of any kind of storyline.And upstaged by a flock of spurious sheep."

The seating is comfortable but a little tight, especially with everyone wearing heavy coats and scarfs into the show and having to store them somewhere on or under their seat.The show is top notch. It is a perfect mixture of dancing, singing, and 3D techno display intermingled in a lovely Christmas story. You are in the heart of Broadway so the quality of the dancers & singers is outstanding. It was a highlight of our trip and would love to see it again next Christmas."

We had will call tickets, arrived 30mins early and still could be seated at the beginning of the show. They do not seat you when show has started until the next scene (there are no intermissions, just switching from scene to scene). There was a ticketmaster pickup line but the agents were still selling tickets and took 15-20mins for the guy to decide where to sit and how to pay. They were still seating people throughout the show. The ushers don't care if you record so everyone had screen shining cell phones out and that was very annoying. I don't want to take away the Rockettes hard work so I definitely still recommend this show but arrive very early."

We were warned that the show would be a bit `twee' however we are really pleased to have gone as it was the most Christmas-like experience we enjoyed this year. At 90 minutes it's not too long and even though we had seats in the second to back row of the stalls it did not hinder our view or enjoyment. The show is well choreographed, the sets are varied and appropriate for each individual performance/ act and the Rockets are great dancers and a treat to watch - they are extremely well synchronised given the number of performers. Our favourite act was the Birth of Jesus, where live animals are used on stage (sheep, camels and a donkey), which adds to the atmosphere with a huge cast - a truly enjoyable extravaganza. Points to note, if you book tickets on-line be sure to take ID - we talked our way in to exchanging our voucher for tickets but only just! The venue is memorable but the queues for refreshments are long with a poor selection of confectionery; take something with you. We booked through Gray Line New York and I believe purchased lower-end value tickets but all was fine and we very much enjoyed this last attraction ending our 5-day break on the day before New Year's eve with a real Christmas feeling. Even our 16-year old daughter came away like a child again!"

We have seen the show several times over the years and sorry to say it has been much better. First off, my Mom was only able to buy 8 tickets per person through Ticketmaster. Luckily, my Mom reached us immediately after placing her order (although we were out of town) and we called Ticketmaster and got 3 seats nearby. The other turn-off is entering the Music Hall, where they herd guests like cattle. They had various lines including an express line, will call and then 3 separate lines if you already had your tickets. My sister had her daughter napping in a stroller and had trouble getting into the Hall. Best advice is to enter early. Also, the lines for the ladies room were very long. The Rockettes, as always, were great and we enjoyed the staging, music and of course the Nativity scene at the end. The other major turn off were the scenes with the Michelle Obama lookalike and her daughter Kayla. We are at this show to escape and relax. They added nothing to the show, were preachy and reminded us that the First Family was on a tax-payer funded 10-day vacation in Hawaii (which we can't afford). Lastly, the price for a large popcorn in a take home tin with 2 drinks, a Radio City cup and an elf hat was $25, pretty steep. Many delis near by sell drinks and popcorn for a lot less. Given the price of the tickets and the experience, we can't say we will be returning anytime soon. We will likely go back to Broadway, as we all saw Spiderman the year before and were surprised as to how good it was given the bad publicity."

Show was 90 minutes. My only complaint is the way they have people queue up outside and then get into the theatre. Very disorganized - much like a cattle call. They could take some lessons from Disney on managing large groups of people getting in/out in a very short period of time. Wouldn't necessarily repeat the experience on a future trip but glad we went since it's a New York classic."

The breaks between numbers for costume changes were filled with interesting stuff and I found the two short 3-D presentations very good. I do wish that I didn't have to get up several times from my aisle seat to let late comers climb over me or have other late comers block my view of the stage; why couldn't they just wait until the next show? I found an online discount for the show, but I would have gone even if I paid full price. I love live theatre and this was another example. I also liked the two organists that played before the show."

I was extremely impressed by the holiday show, which combined the iconic high kicking dance lines I remember from old movies with modern technology. There were scenes that included use of 3D movies projections and a very fun double decker bus sequence with the Rockettes. When the show was coming to a close, I initially was upset in that the show seemed to be only 20-30 minutes long, but to my surprise about 1.5 hours had passed. I highly recommend seeing a show there!"

It's a very classic NYC experience and my daughters were thoroughly entertained by it and thought it was the best part of their day in the city. For me, it was a little hokey and over-priced. But at 90 minutes, it wasn't too long for a youngish child to sit through. There's no intermission and they just breeze through a variety of different acts that included dancing, acting, singing and 3D experiences."

I've given this place four stars in place of five since they have a real crowd management issue. We got there well in advance of the show and they kept us waiting outside the hall, along with many others like us. Finally, they couldn't get everyone seated before the performance started. So a fairly large crowd waited in the foyer and we all missed the start of the performance."

They loved the show, especially the Rockettes' tin soldier segment. If you haven't done this at least once, be sure to treat yourself. The only complaint is how show management continues to seat late comers throughout the show. We were constantly disturbed during the show by people being seated even an hour into the show. I can understand maybe 10 minutes, but they encourage bad behavior by allowing anyone to come whenever they want - this needs to tighten down to not ruin an expensive experience for the 90 percent of the attendees that know to arrive on time."

Yes, it was crowded getting in, but they had easy-to-spot signs directing people to line up on 51st Street. The line was really long, but moved very quickly. (We got in line around 8:45 for the 9:30 p.m. show and were inside around 9:05 p.m.) It was a little confusing where to go inside to find our seats, but the staff were really helpful. Women's bathroom line was very long, but moved quickly and we were in our seats long before the show started.My only \"warning\" is to not expect a quiet, theater style show. There were people selling popcorn etc. up and down the aisles and many people coming in late with drinks from the bar. Also, many people got up to leave (to beat the crowds?) before it was quite over. However, even though we sat near the back, we could see really well. Hint: If you buy tickets early to a 9:30 show, you can get really good seats for under $50.I was afraid it might be a little too cheesy (I am 37), but it was great--yes, it was a little cheesy, but perfect for the holidays! The special effects were awesome. I would totally go again if tickets were under $75 or so.Hint: When you are leaving, head East (towards Brooklyn) on 51st Street and walk over to 3rd Avenue or so instead of getting caught in the mayhem of 6th or 5th Avenue."

This was a Christmas present for my grandchildren (11 and 8) and, on my own, I wouldn't have seen their Christmas show or any other performance. However, by the finale, I had become an admirer and a fan. It was one of the best shows I've ever seen. The costumes are incredibly beautiful. The choreography showcases the versatility and talent of the dancers, who are now a diverse group, as are the other cast members. I was very pleased about that and also the themes, which represent the spirit of Christmas.Trying to determine what I like best is hard to do when a show seems to get better and better with every scene. The 3-D element was great fun and my grandchildren's favorite. I thoroughly enjoyed the simulated bus tour through Manhattan. Here again the choreography was superb and original and the digital graphics a visual delight. The show ends with a very moving Nativity Scene, again with extravagantly beautiful costumes. Here again an illustration of the reason we celebrate Christmas. The entire audience appreciated this and applauded wholeheartedly.The singers and orchestra complemented the show from start to finish underlining \"Music Hall.\" It was a treat to see the orchestra pit rise at the end so that the audience to could give the musicians the face-to-face applause they deserved for their contribution to a spectacular evening. I understand why this is an annual tradition for families."

No intermission in this show but a quick run to the downstairs restrooms during the show worked out fine. The rockettes performed the staples - the wooden soldier dance, the Santa Claus dance and the beautiful Living Nativity. I especially enjoyed the Snow dance and costumes - very pretty. $20 for a huge container of popcorn, soft drinks, and a souvenir was reasonable....got to keep the container too! Wine was a bit pricey but that is expected at venues in NYC ...

Don't understand why so many people bring little kids (even babies) to shows like this, so be prepared for kids being there. Loved all the traditional Rockettes numbers including the soldiers, reindeer, and 12 Days of Christmas, but did not like the new technology sequence. Obviously this was added for the kids' benefit. Way too much dialogue in this mom & daughter scene...we're there to see the Rockette's! The Rockettes did dance during part of this scene, but there was too much going on between the live video game and lights on the ceiling to focus on the Rockettes....definitely over stimulation and took away from the feel of the show.The building was beautifully decorated for Christmas with a huge crystal chandelier in the lobby, Santa on the downstairs level, and tons of festive light.

I saw the Rockettes show here the Sunday before Christmas. As you can expect, the show was sold out and the place was packed. There were mostly families with young (and very young) children in attendance. Be prepared for children talking throughout the show and yelling at certain points of the show. The show itself begins with a children's version of The Nutcracker, which is played out by plush toys. The Rockettes also do their trademark dancing and high kicks. My favorite act was the soldier dance - it is truly unique. My least favorite part involved a long and drawn out bit about a young girl and her mom deciding whether to get her a video game for Christmas. This was by far the low point of the show for me, with a lot of dialogue and cliche punch lines. This portion of the show does culminate in a 3D \"video game\" which some people seemed to enjoy. While I understand the need for the show to try out new technology, I felt that this took away from the overall experience. Apparently this is a new addition since last year's show. Thankfully, the show ended with a Nativity scene with a lovely narration and great scenery. I recommend catching this show if the prices are reasonable for your budget, especially if you have young kids. Otherwise, spend a little more and book tickets well in advance to see the New York City Ballet's The Nutcracker."

Radio City is a beautiful venue for starters, the Rockettes are amazing to watch in their precision, and the show in general is so much fun for the whole family. Our kids are 6 and 8 and this is the third time they have seen the show. They loved it just as much as previous years, and are already looking forward to returning next year! We prefer 1st mezzanine seats since are kids are still small - they get a great view of the show from this area.P.S. Any negative reviews of this show should be dismissed as being written by \"Scrooge\". It's impossible to not enjoy this show! As for complaints about prices? You're in NYC at Christmas-time - why is this surprising to some people?"

Staff shouting and yelling at everyone, only one person per family allowed to queue up at a time to collect tickets etc. it's a shame that the quality of the show doesn't extend to the entry and exit arrAngements. Make sure you arrive 45 mins before the show if you want to ensure you get in on time - and bring plenty of patience with you! Also seating can be a bit hit and miss especially for kids. If they have an adult sitting in the row in front they will struggle to see anything."

After many decades, I took advantage of a \"Living Social\" special and a friend, in the middle of the week, and I had orchestra seats for the Christmas spectacular. The integration of the story line was seamless. The show complete with a unabashed nod to NYC advertising/ tourism, and a 3D component was beyond wonderful,---- amazing!!!...this baby boomer allowed her little child to take in the sights, sounds, and the precision of the world-renowned group of women. My spirit was filled to the joyful brim ...words do no justice to this experience. Despite long lines, the folks @ Radio City know how to move people quickly with great customer service skills."

The only thing wrong with this entire performance was that the ushers did nothing to try to control the unruly field trip kids seated all over the balcony. We had paid a lot of money to see the show, and these middle schoolers were all over the place-- in and out multiple times, holding up bright video recording devices (don't ask me why- they couldn't get a good shot at that distance), and talking throughout the performance. We should probably pay for more expensive tickets for a less obtrusive experience, but they were still very expensive and that's what we could afford. I didn't expect it to be ruined by children that had no supervision and absolutely no idea how to act at a performance like that. Having said that, it was a lovely show and I did enjoy it despite the distractions. I hope the Rockettes will continue to do this type of performance for many more years."

My husband said that part of the fun for him was hearing me shriek and apparently being delighted. It is so worth it to go and even though the lines look insurmountable, I made an observation that might work for you too: we went to the on call to get our tickets and from there, the usher just let us join the line already in the lobby instead of falling in line outside the building, which went for a few blocks.It is great fun, the Hall is immense and and very impressive.

This show is a sad imitation of a once-great legend, and if you watched the brief segment on the Thanksgiving Day Parade telecast, then you've seen all there is to see, and saved yourself $150. Per ticket.You're probably saying to yourself, \"Well, I should at least see this once\". That's the fatal mistake. You think you HAVE to see it, but you really don't WANT to watch corny entertainment like this anymore. It's time to take control of your emotions, and spend that money either upgrading your Christmas presents, or donating it to the Salvation Army. I think Celtic Thunder on PBS has better production quality, and I can't stand Celtic Thunder. If you love Celtic Thunder, don't own a smartphone, and think that Kraft Mac n' Cheese is the best-tasting macaroni & cheese you've ever had, then you'll probably like this show. If you are still deeply captivated by childhood nostalgic feelings for a long line of dancers briefly kicking their legs in unison, and you've got $150 to throw away, then you'll probably go anyway. Take my advice, and go on a less-popular day & time, so you won't feel cheated out of your money like I did."

This year, unfortunately, i was not ecstatic about the storyline with the young girl and her mother. ( last years story line about the mother not being able to find the gift was a better scenario than not wanting to buy her child a video game - in my opinion) but that scene is still one of my favorite new scenes that was added!! I love the video game performance!! My one problem with Radio City is that once the show starts they are still seating people...... It ruins the 3D experience in the beginning of the show. The whole time i had people blocking my 3D experience because the ushers were constantly seating them. In my opinion i do not think that is right and i believe if you are not prepared and get to the show on time then you should not be allowed in once the show begins. It is not fair for everyone else in the theatre who got there on time and are already enjoying the show. Other than people still being seated 40 min into the show. It is a must see and it is a show that anyone would enjoy!!"

I had wanted to go since I was 10.Although the theater is large, it is set up in such a way that it would be hard to find a bad seat anywhere, even the back or the mezzanine, so don't agonize too much over your seat like I did. Just find one that fits your budget and go with it, it will be fine.After the show I did the back stage tour and learned more about the music hall and it decor which was really interesting. They also take you to the top back of the theater where there is an observation room to look out at the stage. IT's here you get the full view and can see that the theater was designed to look like a sunset. The observation room also has an old original movie projector which is cool. They don't show many movies there anymore.If you have the opportunity to visit, I absolutely recommend seeing the Rockettes and if you like history, definitely go on the tour. It's only an hour and you might learn something to talk about at your next dinner party."

I find the 430 show always allows us to get reservations at the popular spots ( sea grill , del friscos grill , rock center cafe ) before or after . Sea fire being my favorite of the three . The kids also love our stops at one of more of the following : NBC store . M and m world , Hershey , magnolia bakery and of course the tree ! A must do at least once if not yearly for the family !"

Their toy soldier performance was absolute perfection. The Rockette that allowed us to take her picture before the show was a doll even though we were probably the 100th family that she posed with. The 10 AM performance had lots of children in attendance and that just added to the fun. Keep in mind that you need to use a different entrance if you already have tickets. Don't waste your time with the masses of people at the main entrance."

Ever since we bought a DVD of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, we've dreamed if seeing it in New York City. The Music Hall is a wonderful, historic theater, reminiscent of the Fox Theater in Atlanta, including the organ at the beginning.The show is first class, and the tickets were surprisingly affordable, given the location. I really like how they use graphics and 3D to \"expand\" the stage by projecting on to the walls next to the stage. The acting and singing are very good, and the Rockettes don't disappoint. We really like how they maintain and respect the true meaning of Christmas, with the scripture reading and dramatization of Christ's birth. The use of live animals was cool. We got our girls' picture with a Rockette, and the price was reasonable. Souvenir dolls were also reasonable at $30."

My wife and I went to see the Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music hall yesterday, and it was simply an amazing and mesmerizing experience. We had Orchestra seats in the middle section, and could not have been happier with the seats. Yes, it cost a pretty penny, and yes, it was worth every one of them. My wife had always wanted to see the Rockettes, never having done so. Last year we wanted to go, but it was later in the month and sold out. I have never seen the Rockettes either, before yesterday, and now I'm both sad that I didn't, and glad that I now did see them. The precision and beauty of the Rockettes performance was something to behold, and I found myself being transported into another world. There were some 3D segments that were pretty entertaining too. My advice to anyone who has not been there yet is to do it, and do it sooner instead of later. The audience was well-behaved, without the usual cell phone yakkers and texting distracters. We saw the 11:00 show, and then went to a very nice lunch at The Sea Grill in Rockefeller Center, which I will review later.I worked in NYC for many, many years, and always held the typical New Yorker's cynical view. \"Ah, it's a tourist trap!\", or \"It's for kids!\" Gee, for some reason, those are the people who seem to have all the fun, and at my age, I needed some fun. This was fun. That whole day was fun. We took mass transit into and out of the city, and I am so glad we could, because driving into NYC during the holiday season can be a nightmare, and finding a place to park that is reasonably priced and close to the venue is virtually impossible. I highly, highly recommend this show, and hope to be able to see the new show coming in the Spring, 2014. Do yourself a favor. Go there. Now."

They smile naturally making everything look flawless and effortless. Other cast members including singers, dancers and actors executed their roles profesionally. The show also uncluded several Santas dancing and a spectacular re-enactment of the nativity scene with living camels and goats on stage. The sets were all beautiful and realistic, pulling the audience in. The costumes, the lighting, the graphics, the timing, the video projection screen. Everything was spectacular like said in the title of the show itself, Christmas Spectacular. It was definately a memorable sight to see and it couldn't have been better."

The Rockettes were wonderful, the other acts entertaining and a definite thumbs up to a great show.HOWEVER - Radio City - please hold back latecomers - I cannot tell you how many people walked in, and continued to stand up blocking views waiting to find their seats while the performance was under way. Also, please stop ALL photography during the performance, no effort was made to tell people to stop taking flash pictures, or even those constantly holding up their cameras and videoing or photographing away. So a BIG 5 for the performance, and 3 for the management of Radio City."

The opening reindeer number is fantastic, the toy soldiers number is fun, and the final Nativity scene is magnificent. They jammed in two 3-d film pieces which were out of place and painful. Still, the choreography, orchestra music, and precision dancing more than carried the day for all ages - even teens. Get there a bit early as they start on time and don't allow many mid show seatings."

My date and I sat eight rows from the stage on an aisle seat and ticket prices were $150 each (plus applicable fees of course). The show was well worth the money. It wasn't crowded (we went on a Tuesday for the 2PM show) at all. The show is not something I would want to watch every year, but having not gone in all those years made it enjoyable. The Rockette's were good but high kicking gets old after a while. Their wooden soldier routine, though old, is still cute to watch. The most amazing thing is the costumes throughout the entire show. And this year (perhaps recent years not sure) they gave us 3D glasses for two parts of the show. That was very good."

We also did the backstage tour right before our show. The tour took bout 45 minutes and was very informative however I expected to see more. It was nice to see the massive theatre when it was empty and hear the history as well as amazing physical facts of the building. We even saw the camels being exercised on the stage. We toured the back hallways viewing the retired costume display but only from the doorway ( I would have like to get a close up), saw the private reception room and watched a short film. But the best part was meeting a Rockette and having g the opportunity to get pictures with ( extra charge but worth it). This tour is not suitable for children under 6, quite a bit of walking and needs a good attention span. Now on to the show...Awesome! We purchased tickets as a larger group a month in advance for the matinee, so the price was very reasonable. The Rockettes did not disappoint! My grandson was enthralled and we enjoyed every minute of the show. The scenes were beautiful and the dancers precision was perfect. This theatre is technologically amazing adding to the wonder of the whole experience. From projected scenes on the ceiling to dancers up the sides on platforms to the stage turning, rising, tilting and lowering this building is as wonderful as the show! We loved every minute of it...The Radio City Music Hall is not to be missed!"

I was pleasantly surprised at how fantastic the show was! I was entertained throughout, and was blown away at the intricate and technical sets. The scenes were quite long and energetic and the dancers never seemed to tire a bit. We had seats in the first row of the third mezzanine, and even though far from the stage, we had an excellent view and were able to fully appreciate the precision of the dance lines and how in sync the dancers were. One drawback was a metal support holding a mirror ball that partially blocked my husband's view, which was not disclosed when we purchased the tickets. We were also taken back by the prices at the concessions and souvenir kiosks...everything was outrageously expensive. The security men were also quite rude to us and others when we were waiting in line to enter the theater, and were yelling and generally treating us disrespectfully, as if we were stupid. That left a bad taste in my mouth since we were paying guests. I would still highly recommend seeing the show though since it is so entertaining and well-produced."

            "review": "A spectacular only to some. First, let me say my personal opinion is that everyone should see it at least once in their life. This is my 4th time. It brings back memories of when I was a child. Show is 90 minutes (no intermission) and has been updated. What hasn't changed is the nativity scene, the fall of the wooden soldiers and there is always ice skaters and Santa of course. The scenes and the venue are spectacular if you stop to think what it takes to put on this show. I brought my 26, 21 and 18 year old. Their response to the show was \"it's ok\". So if you are bringing teens, expecting them to love it, they will not. It is geared more towards younger kids, and the parents who marvel in watching it through the eyes of their child. Other advice I can give - take the time to look around, the venue is amazing, and dress warm, the place was quite chilly. I had decent middle orchestra seats, and sill had to lean left or right to see the stage which I found quite annoying. While you are there make sure you take the time to walk over to Rockefeller Center to see the tree."

The show was very very very good - everyone enjoyed it. Sounded a little too miked for my liking, but the live music is wonderful and not found everywhere.

My teenagers were rolling their eyes over the unsubtle \"lesson\" - play with your kids? Really? I spent money for this piece of advice? here's my advice - listen to this idea and spend your money buying the VIP pass for the Rink at Rockefeller Center instead. Enjoy the laughter of your children while drinking hot cocoa and ice skating without the lines. Thats where the \"magic\" is - it sure as heck is not at this show where the \"perfect\" gift from Santa is a video game. Bah humbug. Seriously awful and disappointing. The Rockettes were amazing.

I have often passed by Radio City and saw the line for the tours but never had the opportunity to take the tour. Tickets are purchased on the north side entrance at a very reasonable cost. There are tours every hour and the tour itself takes approx. 1 hour. I was lucky to be in a small group, just 7 of us so the person leading our group was able to give personal attention. I really recommend this tour for anyone who is curious about the history of Radio City and the Rockettes. Of course a highlight is meeting a Rockette and having a photo op. Kristin, the Rockette also gave us some background on the training they go through and their work. The tour takes around the main areas of hall including a number of behind the scene areas. Having seen a couple of shows here, I had only seen the lobby and the main public areas. We were taken into way up in the upper area of the hall where the lighting crew works and we were also able to see the spectacular end of the Christmas Show. The guide provided us with a wealth of information on the history of Radio City and famous performers from the past and present. At the end you are provided an opportunity to purchase the pictures with the Rockette. I found it sort of found amusing that all the married guys chose not to take a picture with Kristin....lol"

I thought it would be exciting to sit close up for the kids, we had second row in the BB section. The seats were too close, so don't spend the extra money for those seats and try to sit further away, you don't get to enjoy the perfect line that the Rockettes create when you are that close to the stage. The show is fun, I haven't been since I was a kid and some of it has changed but not much. The Rockettes are always beautiful and the toy soldier scene was a favorite among my children. The show runs straight through with no intermission (this actually worked for my kids because their attention span only lasts so long). Book it, don't stress about the seats even if you are in the mezzanine you will be fine. Also, if you have girls that are 8 and older you can book tickets through American Girl. For $ 100 you get a dinner at American Girl, craft and tickets to the XMAS spectacular. It is a great deal! There are also opportunities to meet a rockette and a photo op. Of course the dates and times are limited if you book through American girl. Good Luck, Happy Holidays and enjoy. Nothing beats NYC during XMAS season....its simply the best!"

It was just for my husband and I, (didnt go with any kids)The queues outside went down really quickly which was good really as it was -3'C! A quick bag check and in we were.There were good areas of the show which i really liked, e,g the soldiers and when they all fell down, the tour bus sight seeing scene. But i didnt enjoy the dancing teddy bear bit, just a bit dull, no impact to the point where i got my phone out..The santa that would come out and speak to the audience I found quite hard to understand what he was saying most of the time as he was putting on an old voice accent.It covers a lot of christmas songs and it will make you come out feeling a lot more christmassy.I dont want to put a downer on the show,THe Rockettes were amazing and will make up for the weak bits in between.I got my tickets through Groupon so I got them at a discount price which was a plus and got really good seats so get them through them, you can only watch them in November though.."

Favorite scene: Scene 6- New York at ChristmasLeast favorite scene: Scene 13- NativityMe (24 y/o), my nephew (9 y/o), and Mom (52 y/o) all enjoyed the show! It's great for all ages. 90 minutes straight through. I love the scene about Christmas in New York, esp. the ice skating in Central Park since I took my nephew earlier that day ice skating at Wollman Rink! This show really puts you in the holiday spirit. The outfits were glitzy/flashy. The scenes were incredible. I probably wouldn't have paid full price, but the Groupon deal I purchased ($65/seat in the orchestra section) was definitely a great value! We were pretty close up. Even if we were in the mezzanine/balcony, I think we still would've seen just fine.Sorry for no pics of the show- they don't allow flash photography and my phone will not take good pics without any flash :("

Of course, then you get inside and WOW! It takes your breath away. Even loved the ladies lounge. Made the boyfriend come with me, and he turned to me after about the third number and said he was getting chills! Mission accomplished! We both really enjoyed the show.

Everything from the singing, to dancing to the sets and lighting were all excellent. We were seated up in the second mezzanine because the only seats down in the orchestra and first mezzanine were way to the side. I had read somewhere that the centre seats were better, even if you had to go to the second mezzanine to get them and we were glad we did. Plus, the height enabled us to see the entire stage and get a very nice view of everything. The best word to describe the show was \"impressive\"!"

The most gorgeous chandelier hangs in the center. We were seated in the second mezzanine, and had great views. I don't think there is a bad seat in the house. The organ music was very nice before the show started. And once it started...wow. We were a large group, ages 7 to 70. It was fantastic. Everyone enjoyed it. Although- the classic parts of the show were much better than the newer ones. The nutcracker, tin soldiers and dancing santas, for example, were fantastic. Once the show segued into the more recently written part (finding a happy medium with video games between parent and child) it seemed dated already. If they just stuck with the more classic themes, it would have been better. That being said- the youngest and the oldest in our group loved every part. Afterward, Santa (the best looking one I've ever seen) and a Rockette were available for photos in the lobby. We did the photo with the Rockette, because they aren't as easy to find! There were lots of concessions and souvenirs available. Take a side trip to the 'Ladies Lounge'. What a hoot! A total throwback, with chairs in front of mirrors for reapplying your powder and lipstick.I think it is a must if visiting New York at Christmas time. Enjoy!"

They make marching bands, ice skaters, synchronized swimmers, and most military drill teams look sort of pale by comparison.We sat in the first row of the first (of 3) mezzanines and the view was perfect.

I feel very fortunate that I was given tickets to attend this stunning performance. Radio City Music hall is run like a well oiled machine. Entry into this large facility is seamless and quick. Once inside you are transported to a place of sparkle and wonder. We sat in the second mezzanine, which is perfect for seeing the whole stage. The 90 minute show starts on time and no entry is allowed once the show begins, so plan to go early. The Rockettes are fantastic. Their costumes are beautiful in color, sparkle and entirely represent the song and words of each different theme. At times I counted as many as 48 dancers. The performances were told in a story, with precision - like perfection. Some parts are in 3 D and glasses are given to you when you enter the auditorium. The stage was huge and multi functioning with many possible arrangements and layers. parts of the stage could be spun in circles, some dropped down and dancers popped through the floor, three levels of stage could occur easily and the orchestra pit came up and down at any time. The costumes featured fuzzy furry bears, and cartoon characters, toy soldiers, three wise men, two camels, little kids, Christmas elves, a train, the North Pole, a NYC tour bus, and tons more. In one part we were immersed into a video game in order to save Christmas from bah humbug. With the ceiling and walls under a simulator effect, you truly felt transported onto the back of Santa's sleigh, or in the North Pole inside Santa's toy shop. There are robotic, remote controlled huge snowflakes that appear through the floor and float around and then retreat back into the floor. There is no intermission and the costumes changes are many. No food or drink is allowed, nor any zoom lens camera's and your purse and bags are checked outside radio City Music hall. Absolutely the best show to see especially at this time of year. A perfect gift. For anyone who has kids interested in dance, like my special southern belle Larissa, this show is a must see. The stage hands are exceptional in the many set changes and rapid flow of one scene to another with the stage curtains pulled into several different varieties of shapes. It is very busy in this areas, so I highly recommend taking a cab or walking from where you are staying. We went by tour bus with WADE TOURS, so they just dropped us at the door. Truly magnificent!!!! A Christmas Spectacular indeed!!!"

I would highly recommend this show to everyone, at least to see it once. The Rockettes were great. They incorporated some 3-D film into the production. The venue was very crowded but I don't think they were sold out during this particular show. They probably get more people closer to Christmas. We also spent the extra money and took a picture with a Rockette - so cool! After the show, we walked around the area for a while. They were just putting together the tree at Rockefeller Center. You could conceivably make a day of it, if you plan it right. Of course, this is New York so I think things are very expensive around Radio City, which is just one big tourist trap. But, we knew what we were getting into, so a good time was still had by all."

Santa and the Rockettes were great as always. The show is entertaining for all ages. After the show my daughter got to pose for a picture with a Rockette. The pictures were expensive but it made my child's day. We had a good time."

Santa was great and many of them! Nice story and of course the Rockettes were superb with their toy soldiers, snow flakes and legs. Everyone loved it. I thought it was best to be in first mezzanine since the show is not only on the stage but on the sides too. Stage is huge and production covers the whole area. You have no problem hearing from any seat. Tickets online are the easiest; always a line up at the entrance, get there early, show starts right on time. Great way to spend the afternoon. Lobby is decked out in snowflakes and chandelier is gorgeous."

Simulated a interactive video game. The orchestra was at its best. The size and scope of the props amazing as the audience was taken on a tour of Manhattan via bus and the Rocketts. The size of the stage is impressive. Largest I have ever seen. The manger scene and procession with camels and other live animals was inspiring. Show ended with the magnificent pipe organ. This is a not to miss event if you are in NY for the holidays,"

The theater is absolutely gorgeous, never having seen it outside of the movie Annie. The show is a wonderful blend of digital projection, singing, and of course, the Rockettes precision dance team, who can leave any military drill team in the dust. Before and after the show, there is an opportunity to have your picture taken with either Santa Claus, who serves as the host of the show, or with one of the Rockettes. If you are in New York from early November through the end of December, make sure to see the show."

This would pertain to the staff that keeps you in line, while they chat it up with each other. Then at the last minute rush us all in like cattle. I perfer the first tier, you are able to see full stage. The lines during break at the concession stands are endless. They have more stands but they remain close. This could be a burden, especially if your at the end of the line. Same holds for the bathroom especially the Ladies room.

The show was ruined first by all the latecomers . The show started at 8:00 pm Everyone was settled by 8:45. Tony sang until 9:20 pm. What's with people in new York? That 's RUDE to your fellow theatre goers and to your entertainer. We're not talking one or two people here. What was worse was the amount of people holding up cell phone cameras with bright lights to take a picture, which, let's face it folks, no one can make out. Why not just buy a DVD? Or why not just live in the moment and enjoy the show and let others around you enjoy the show? In Paris at the Olympia theatre the staff use a laser pointer on anyone trying to take pictures or video. Works well. Why can't the staff at Radio City take measures to control this annoyance so others can enjoy the show they paid for. Close the doors when a show starts and late comers be damned . They can enter at intermission as in a play.Or, is this the entitled American way?"

A massive theatre with so many seats the seat plans were confusing at first but download the plans and you can work out the different pricing structure. We went to see the Christmas Spectacular in December 2012 so this review is for people looking to book seats for the 2013 show. Do not use buy/sell sites - I found these unreliable and not very credible. Buy direct from the theatre website well before the date you want to go.The \"restricted view\" seats only have the sound man standing in the middle in front of you, but the view is by far restricted because the man is lowered into his own section. So do not let this deter you. Expect to pay around $80-100 dollars for average priced seats.The show itself was amazing! I will say no more to avoid spoiling the show for you!Expect LOTS of queues around the vicinity of the music hall. The crowds are controlled by police which go around the block. So keep children and your personal belongings very close to you."

However, Radio City Music Hall is NOT what it once was. Cheesy commercialism, they allow rude, drunk people to harass others during the show, and make one throw out perfectly good bottled water in favor of overpriced crap inside. When I was little, and as a teenager, visited this place many times. It was beautiful. Food and drinks were not allowed inside, nor was it sold inside (and now they sell alcohol!!!). You could enjoy the iconic salted hot pretzel while waiting on line. They also have too many bright lights everywhere - if you are seated in the balcony, good luck seeing anything on stage! They have two distracting screens on either side of the stage, advertising the same crap every few minutes. Yes, this once beautiful, iconic, classic example of Art Deco has gone completely downhill. Very, very disappointing."

Don't want to \"spoiler\" it too much, so suffice it to say you go up down, over, under, forward & back throughout all of RCMH, and will learn some neat things about the place & its history that the average person would probably never know otherwise. You'll be wowed by the sheer size of the theater & lobby. Tour stops in 10-12 distinct areas and passes through many others, includes a video, photo op & Q&A w/ a Rockette, chances to view a lot of their old costumes - and bonus: our tour happened to be during a Rockette's practice session! Photos are allowed anywhere (except Rockette's practice), so have your camera handy. Misc. tips: - Average tour size around 20 people, so try a later Sunday afternoon (or off hour) tour for a much smaller group. (Ours had 5.)- Be prepared to climb A LOT of stairs throughout various parts of the tour, but definitely worth it. Pretty sure they also have elevators for handicapped accessibility. - The tour is free with the New York Pass (not to be confused with the New York City Pass)."

We were not told that the tour was restricted to only corridors and hallways because of ongoing events. We came here interested in the beautiful architecture and construction and not to look at posters of celebrities and watch a badly done, completely uninteresting video (that we could easily have seen on YouTube) in a chamber . We had informed ourselves out of interest before we took the tour and got to know less during the tour than we read before. That should absolutely not be the case.We felt totally pranked - if we had known that we neither could access the auditorium, the stage, the foyer nor the suite, we would have saved the money for a next journey to New York. I would have wished to know how the \"stage\" tour was altered to specific events to decide for myself to take the tour or not.Please excuse any mistakes that are because of the foreign language.Very disappointed."

Bought tickets (fifth row center) in August. Sometimes the expectations are so high they can not be met. This was not the case for the Christmas Rockettes show - it was everything we expected and more. Absolutely the highlight of our visit. That was December 2010. I must say we enjoyed it so much we returned again in December 2012 to see the Rockettes show again. I gave it an excellent rating (wish there was a higher rating available). I would recommend getting the best seats one can afford - it is well worth the money (save on something else such as a few meals if necessary). It was alsoworthwhile to do the backstage tour and get a history of Radio City Music Hall as well as the Rockettes."

Our tour guide, Joyce, was a breath of fresh air...she held our attention throughout the tour and was so well informed. From start to finish it was like taking a step back in time, the place is seeped in history, fame and fortune with plenty of 'behind the scenes' stories of intrigue...if those walls could talk...!! The 'restroom break' was one of the highlights of the tour (seriously!) the facilities have been kept in original condition - I will say no more...go see for yourself...you will be impressed!The tour ends with the 'traditional' photo-shoot (like most tours do). The Rockette we met was a delightful young lady who has been dancing with the Rockettes for 10 years so she had many a story to tell. Verdict: Thoroughly enjoyable!"

It's a New York tradition apparently and sells out upto 6 shows a day! Took my football loving husband here for his birthday and even he loved it. Booked it months in advance here in the UK and picked up the tickets there which was fine. The theatre is huge, and tickets are hugely expensive. We sat in the middle of the balcony and had a great view at about $100 each. The nativity scene at the end is so over the top - real donkeys and camels on the stage - just hilarious. Very Christmasey show and if you like your entertainment a little on the camp side then this could be the show for you."

My friend and I were in row K and never felt as if we missed out on any of the view.I deducted a point from my review because arriving at the event was crazy, with a line of people in formal wear stretching all the way to the other end of Rockefeller Square.

We arrived early to the show and I am so glad we did, we had to collect our tickets from the box office as it was an international order. We had our bags checked and my husband had his camera and camcorder confiscated. (we had been taking in the sights on the way to the music hall) We didn't have a problem having the camera taken away but then to spend the entire show distracted by dozens of camera flashes I then have a problem. No members of staff tried to stop anyone using a camera and we had to mess around after the show waiting in line to collect our camera. It should be the same rules for everyone, I understand some people will get through but the sheer number of cameras being used was a joke.During the bag check they also make people bin any food or drink they have with them. We didn't have any but I could understand why people try to get their snacks in. I think it was about $15 for two bottles of water.We joined a queue to have our photo taken with Santa- another overpriced idea over $50 for one large and two small photos. Definitely not worth it.I received an email before we travelled stating we could collect a free pin badge for guests, don't bother wasting your time as none of the staff would point me in the direction of where to go.All this aside the building is amazingly beautiful and ornate looking.We were seated for the show in the rear mezzanine and paid $148 for two tickets. Although the music hall is huge we had an amazing view, it is just a shame we had two noisy drunks shouting all the way through, disturbing us and many other guests.Again the staff did nothing about it and it was only when the pair of drunks walked out half way through that we could enjoy the show in peace.All of this complaining doesn't take away the talent of the Rockettes I have always wanted to see them in a show so this was amazing for me and all in all it was a good night out! Just a few little tweaks that would turn a very good experience to an amazing experience.I did email the Radio City Hall with my comments but never received a reply!"

The end was so emotional for me and I am not one to cry in movies or anything but this show did it. . . I cried. After the show we had backstage passes and had a personal tour. I was even more impressed of how small the back was and how old some of the backstage gadgets were. The people that put on the show and that are physically in the show obviously are hard, dedicated people! I would recommend this show to anyone. If you have kids don't be afraid. . .

Our tour guide did a great job of informing us of the rich history of RCMH and the decor is very beautiful. We toured behind the scenes areas, the upper balconies, and were able to meet a Rockette and ask her questions at the conclusion of the tour. Definitely plan to visit for a show sometime, most likely the Christmas Spectacular which is supposed to be out-of-this-world. Definitely worth a visit while you are in NYC."

I got discount tickets (check for discount codes on their website), about 75 dollars each for about halfway back, so for that price it was certainly worth it. Great show, amazing visuals and costumes, including a fun 3D videogame themed part (with glasses handed out). The requisite kick line is of course awesome and iconic (if somewhat repetitive). But the highlight for me was the toy soldier routine, and the dancing Santas. They also did a routine with a real tour bus onstage going by NYC landmarks, and the background screen moved in time, making it look like they were really moving. Very cool! We took our 7 and 11 year old boys, and they paid attention the whole time (not an easy feat!). That in itself is the highest praise.The theater itself is just as impressive as the show, a truly beautiful art deco gem. Makes you feel like you're in \"The Great Gatsby.\" And Rockefeller Center is right down the road, so head down there before or after and see the tree during Christmas time."

The sound is miked and comes out from overhead speakers. It was sometimes harsh and had a very muffled quality with occasional reverb overlays. I'm not some auditory purist but the problem was significant enough to be an issue and it became increasingly irritating. They need to overall the amplification system if the theater is to do justice to virtuoso performances. The Christmas show is a classic with great special effects and it rarely disappoints."

A couple of acts involve 3d animation that is very effective.By far my favorite act was the Toy Soldier act. The precision marching of the Rockettes is outstanding and very memorable.Getting tickets was straightforward though the $70 per ticket for a floor seat was a bit much. I was worried that further back on the main floor would not be good seats, but nothing to fear, as all seats on the floor seem excellent. To make the trip to NYC a little less expensive, we drove and a nearby parking lot for only $46/day, which by Manhattan standards seems a bargain."

The building is so huge that you a great deal of time is spent transitioning from room to room, many of which are on different floors. We got to take a break in the ladies lounge as a group and I needed to take the break because I had just gotten off a Stairmaster. Regardless, of this the tour was very factual and covered the entire history of Radio City Music Hall. At the end of the tour you get to meet a Rockette which was my favorite part. I was not impressed that after paying admission for the tour that you aren't allowed to take a picture with the Rockette for a keepsake. Instead they charge you a ridiculous amount of money for a picture taken by a photographer. This angers me.I went here as part of a tour wih my university and it was aleady paid for, I otherwise wouldn't have gone. It was ok and worth seeing once I suppose but it isn't for everyone.The building was big and grand but it is dated. I would have been more impressed if the deccor were modernized. Everything was laid put in a museum style with Rockette costumes displays. They were nice but it was as if everything was stuck in time. For such a grand venue that has hosted awards shows and concerts I expected it to hold a certain elegance and prestige, while instead it held as more of a history lesson. I got some value out of the tour but if I return it will be to see a live show and not to admire the building."

The Rockettes were there, but they also showed a family movie in those days. We weren't well-to-do by a long shot, so it must have been affordable. Sadly, that same family income would not allow you to take your children to see the Christmas show now. It is VERY expensive! More than the Tony Award winning play we saw the next night! The show was good and we were glad we went, but probably would not go again due to the cost and that they don't change the show much from year to year. We sat in one of the balconies, so we did not get the best seats, but they were about $100 a piece. This is what you pay for a Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas. You get a lot more for your money at Cirque du Soleil.I was also put off by all the \"Circus\" selling in the lobbies. You know, the stuff they sell to kids to light up and twirl, etc... No need for that here, just another money grabbing attempt.It makes me sad that the average NYC child can no longer go to Radio City for a show due to the greed of the Music Hall."

There were 10 of us in the group. My family and I are very big on Christmas and this show put us right in the spirit! We went to see the show the first weekend it was opened. One piece of advice is to check the christmas spectacular website often as tickets go on sale on there from time to time. We were able to secure tickets in the Orchestra section for $49 per ticket! We purchased them the week of the show, but we ended up saving about $50-60 per ticket, so it worked out great. The show itself is a MUST SEE especially for children and the big kid in all of us adults. This was the 85 year celebration, so I'm not sure how it was different than shows in previous years, but all in all it was a wonderful experience for my parents, siblings, wife, children and myself!"

After seeing The Nutcracker Ballet at the Lincoln Center, we expected the show to be as spectacular as it claims to be. Unfortunately, it was not that great. Here's why we thought so:#1 Messy queue outside the building. #2 They let late comers coming in during the show thus distracting others.#3 They let people taking photographs/video during the show, the flash was quite annoying.#4 Some parts are boring that they serenaded my husband to sleep.#5 The show failed to bring the climax of the story. We didn't even realize that the last part was actually the ending. What we love about the show:#1 The Rockettes costumes! I really love them.#2 The 3D addition to the show (except the game 3d, was quite boring).So having said that, I don't think I'll come back for more next time. But for you who would like to see The Show, I'd recommend you to get Mezzanine One seats."

I got a seat in the first row of the balcony and it allowed for an excellent view of the whole stage. At times it seemed like I was a bit far away, but if I had been down on the floor, it would have been more difficult to see everything that was going on. So go and see the famous Rockettes and see if you can get your legs up that high."

While it has always been amazing, the latest show is updated and modern with 3-D features, a heartfelt story line, and of course those long legged beauties outfitted in a variety of holiday costumes. I have bought everything from the cheap seats to the expensive ones, and don't think there is a bad seat in the house. Truly an event for all ages and one that will make any Scrooge-like tendencies disappear."

Our seats were in the first mezzanine in the 3rd row. My husband would prefer to spend more money and sit much closer on the floor. Next time, I'll be sure to do that. If you like to see the 'whole picture', the first mezzanine is great, but if you want to see the faces of the performers more clearly, then pay the money and sit closer.It was pretty easy to buy tickets online and I had them mailed. I was able to choose exactly where we would sit - nice feature.There is a food voucher that can be purchased when you get tickets. If you plan to get drink and popcorn - that's the way to go to reduce costs. Don't miss it!"

However, the show itself was very random and the only time we enjoyed it was when the Rockettes were on stage. They weaved a very boring and typical storyline about a child and mother looking for the popular Christmas gift which didn't make much sense with the beginning or the end of the show. Also, the living nativity scene at the end was neat, but also didn't fit with the rest of the show.Overall, I enjoyed the Rockettes themselves, but overall the show was a bit of a let down."

Although the songs are familiar they make them so long and drawn out that it made the kids bored and they kept asking when it was going to be over. We'll wait a few years before trying again. On a positive note it did start on time and the orchestra was great. The soldier act was amazing with the syncronization."

They did not disappoint! Their spectacular show offers something for everyone in the family - even the men enjoyed it - for it's artistry as well as the pretty dancing girls.. The 3-D element kept the children interested. My all-time favorite is the \"Toy Soldiers\" routine. I have seen most all of the big shows in Vegas and this show holds its own with any of them. The only down-side is that they allow late-comers to enter the theater during the performance, disrupting the show for everyone - not cool;. If you can't get there on time, you should have to wait to enter at least until a number is over. We missed a lot or the 3-D portion due to stragglers. Worth the price anyway."

For the price of the tickets for the Christmas Spectacular, we had expected a show that would not be that relatively short and would not include 3D movies for more than a third of the show. If I want to see a movie, I'll go to the cinema. The incorporation of the story of the birth of Jesus Christ did not fit into the overall show at all so from that perspective, the show was put badly together. We ordered champagne and got it in cheap plastic and way too small glasses. After the show had started, they still let people in who were late which was very annoying. Also people were makimg flash photography all the time even though it's clearly stated this is forbidden. Rightly or wrongly we had expected a more classy experience which it was clearly not. We would not go there again that quickly."

We have never been away for christmas before and wanted some good christmas entertainment. We decided to go to the Rockettes Show at The Radio City Music Hall. Wow - as you went in it was decorated beautifully, lovely chandoliers and decorations. The show was superb, there were 36 dancers (the rockettes) across the front of the stage, their dancing was excellent, all in time and they were beautifully dressed. There were also singers and children in the show who were also excellent. There was also a 3D film that was also great fun to watch! The christmas message was put across in a delightful way. the whole show was introduced by Santa himself!! My family and I throughly enjoyed the whole show and would certainly recomment it. One tip though buy your tickets from Times Square ticket office when you get there, they are very expensive to buy online before hand."

It's certainly not just a bunch of high stepping female dancers - although they are the stars of the show. The cast was much bigger and more diverse than i expected. Best parts from my perspective were all the visual effects (I'm a photographer so I get into all that stuff.) There was excellent 3D movie selections (complete with 3D glasses) and the coordination of the live performers and the animated background movies was superbly done. Sit up close to the front of the balconies so you have a full view of the ceiling. Many videos and special effects occur directly above you."

We arrived 20 minutes early to a line that stretched a full block long. People were pushing and shoving and cutting in line. The show started on time, so the beginning numbers were interrupted by people taking their seats late. We sat about half way back in the orchestra section. Instead of taking in the show, scads of audience members were taping and watching it through smart phones and tablets and taking flash photography. It was like sitting in a dark movie theater while the people in front of you recorded the movie. This lack of civility ruined the show for me."

Other then that little downfall, the show was AMAZING! It was a great show for people of all ages. I personally am a competitive dancer so I don't just give all shows 5 stars but this one was great! The only thing I\"m still unsure about is I think the tap sounds are recorded which is pretty disappointing but I'm sure they might do this so everyone in the theater can hear them.

If you are happy for the experience, we would suggest taking the cheapest seats (or the next level up -$30 or $50 on the day we went. Buy them at the box office just prior to the show. We could see everything and thoroughly enjoyed the 90 minute show. Would definitely recommend."

We all loved it. My daughter was mesmerized for 90 minutes and it far exceeded my expectations. The last time we went we were in the last row of orchestra seating. This time we were much closer and the seats made a big difference. If you go, pay the extra money to get a little closer. I don't think anyone pays list price for this show. There are tons of deals. We paid $70 per seat including fees through Groupon and we bought our tickets only a week before the show. We were about 14th row orchestra."

We had 3rd mezzanine seats, rows 3 and 4 and would definitely recommend them if you are watching your costs. There were a lot of families around us with small children who also enjoyed the show. We arrived about 30 min prior to the start of the show, no lines, we went right through Security and were in our seats in no time at all. Lines for the restrooms were extremely long after so I would suggested, if you need to go, try to get in before the show actually ends. It is a 90 min show with no intermission."

First of all I have to say the Rockets costumes were totally amazing and their dancing faultless, especially when doing all the high kicks and difficult dance moves. Well done girls. A very professional and enjoyable show. The first 3D film was great but the second one didn't do it for us. Afterwards, we should have been buzzing but sadly we felt the show missed something. The final scene was fantastic and did bring the real meaning of Christmas home but perhaps a little more humour from Santa, a clearer story line and more familiar Christmas music could have evoked that Christmas feeling that we all look for at this time of the year. I would recommend you go and see it for yourself as the choregraphy was spectacular."

The Radio City Rockette's graced us with their wonderful, out of sight performance while on Tour here in our area at the \"VERIZON THEATER\" in Grand Prairie TX. It was no wonder there were no camera's allowed. It would have ruined the whole event. The show was so Beautiful!! The show also included a great \"Santa Clause\". They had a Manger Scene at the ending that was to die for!!!! It was so vibrant,colorful, beautiful and solom. You could have heard a pin drop. I have always wanted to see the Rockette's in person and now I have!! It was worth the wait !!THEY WERE WONDERFUL!!! We saw their performance on Dec. 8th. Their last day here. If any one of you ever go to this Verizon, and are Handicapped as I am, be sure to tell one of the parking guides, (they all have walkie-Talkies), you will need wheelchair assistance. We didn't know about this at first . One of the young people on wheel chair detail noticed me strugeling and abouot to cave, told me not to move another inch, that he or one of the others would be right there. They rolled me all the way to our isle. Then my girlfriends took over again. I never would have made it with out their assistance and that wheelchair! This was a free service, so i tried to tip them. I think one of them finally accepted. They were very nice and helpful and yes they have handicapped parking. I do not know about strollers or lockers / storage. This was a musical about 2 hrs. long (maybe a little longer) with an intermission in the middle, which all of us smokers appreciated very much. It was warm and not too windy. Thank God for ''smoking areas\"!! One more thing. It just goes to prove that no matter how old you are and not too disabled and if you are lucky enoough to have a friend like I have, you can still get to see and go to places you thought you would never be able to enjoy. I do not get out very often but when I do I make the most of it, thourghly enjoy myself and have a BALL !!!! I hope all of you do the same ."

From the extravagently decorated lobby to the ample seating of the perfectly designed auditorium, Radio City Music Hall deserves every rave review in the book.

Honestly, people CAN go without food for 90 minutes. Food noises and smells was distracting. But, what is REALLY distracting is that management walks latecomers in during a number. Excuse me, but if we paid that much for our tickets, can't you please hold back those people until a dance or number is over with???If you treat the audiences like you should, then respect for the place and the performers is what you will get.

The only thing that keeps me from giving this a 5 out of 5 stars is that is WAY too crowded on the main concourse when you entry the lobby to the building. Radio City Music Hall is beautiful inside and there is so much to see and that is what everyone is doing.....seeing/looking. Taking pictures. The back-up and traffic jam it causes before you can reach the stairs that take you up to the mezzanine are terrible. There has got to be a better way to usher the mass of people into this (and I would assume other) shows. Perhaps they could usher people in by seating area?Once you are inside, unless you are seated in the Orchestra, there is no reason to stay on the main floor lobby. Most people head up the stairs as there are also bars, bathrooms, souvenir stands and concessions up there that are mush closer for the mezzanine seats.We were there for a 9:30pm Friday night show that was NOT sold out. I can't imagine if you showed up for a sold out show!We sat in the first mezzanine and our seats were good. I probably would have sat in the orchestra if I had it to do again. I sometimes hesitate to sit too close to the stage in a performance like this, but it appeared that the orchestra seats in this venue were set up really well and that you aren't too close for great viewing. My husband and I went by ourselves, but it would be a great show for families. Our children (ages 1-11 years) would have loved it. I do not know if they allow strollers, but I cannot imagine how you could move in there with one. If you are taking small children I would certainly leave the stroller at home. Prices at the concessions were high, but not terrible in comparison with other venues I have been to that are similar. For instance, we got a large popcorn, 2 drinks and 2 souvenirs for $20.The show absolutely blew us away. We expected just \"dancing girls\" and some awesome choreography and we got so much more! There were several story lines and \"acts\" throughout the show and the Rockettes were not the only performers. It was an incredible Christmas show that even told the story of Jesus' birth - what an unexpected and wonderful surprise! I would highly recommend this venue and the Rockettes Christmas Spectacular show to anyone able to go see it!"

My wife and I frequented Radio City Music Hall as children when they offered a double feature with a stage show featuring the Rockettes between the two films. Prior to this past weekend, our last time there was probably in the 1970s. Back then, it was still a show place regardless of what was being performed. The art-deco motif, the sound of the organs filling the hall, the spectacular stage and shows performed on it and the shear expansiveness of the larges auditorium in NYC, all combined to make a visit to Radio City an unforgettable experience. Now, patrons are herded in like cattle. Upon entering the main foyer, one has the sense of being in a carnival or circus. Wall to wall people and vendors walking a midst them selling programs and promotional products and toys with flashing, whirling lights...all well over priced! Want a cocktail, water or soft drink? Better have a large bill fold at the ready! We ordered a vodka rocks and paid $12 for about 1/2\" of liquid at the bottom of a plastic low ball glass. While the show and the Rockettes are still very, very good, the filth in the places significantly detracts! The carpets were very soiled and stained and there was pop corn and other litter in the aisles and under the seats.We had touted going to Radio City as a part of the NYC Christmas experience and were embarrassed after encouraging friends to spend their hard earned funds for something that was nothing like what we remembered and were led to believe still existed based upon the Radio City web site. We fear that, continuing on it's current path, Radio City's days may be numbered."

My partner had bought us some VIP ticket to see the rockettes as a christmas gift - after a bit of faff at the ticket office we were handed our tickets and a sheet explaining what our VIP tickets entailed. This letter explicitly said to arrive 90mins before the performance started, which made sense considering our tickets included a buffet, open bar and a chance to get a photo with 2 rockettes.So, we dutifully turned up and waited at what we thought was the appropriate line (we'd asked 2 guards, so we were fairly sure we were in the right place). And were hearded into the music hall and sent down stairs (next to the toilets) and waited ...and waited...and waited...no VIP credentials, no open bar, no rockettes, just cheap popcorn sold at a hugely over inflated price with screaming kids. We didn't ask 1, but 2 staff members, specifically stating we were VIP ticket holders, but the both assured us we were in the right place.I ended up having to demand the manager, who tried to pin the blame on us, saying we had arrived too early. When i asked for a refund of our VIP tickets we got sent from staff member to staff member and then sent up to the roxy suite (were we should have been the whole time!). It was 5mins before the performance and we had missed our chance to get a picture with the rockettes, by this time we were fed up and just wanted to see the show and get out of this terribly organized flea market.I had no problem with the performance, was very well put together and all that we had been expecting, but was thoroughly, amazingly disappointed with the front of house service.For a long standing establishment it was shoddy and embarrassingly bad service."

It seems like the same spirit that leads people to get in fights over sales on Black Friday.First, when you get there, they will go through your bags. Heaven forbid that you have a water bottle, because they will make you throw it out (so you will buy their overpriced water inside). They claim to have 'security' concerns about water. Yeah. Right.Once you've gone through that humiliating ritual, you enter a large room, festooned with many corporate ads. I'm sorry--the tickets are more expensive than a Broadway show (and it seats many more). I don't want to see ads everywhere. But the ads aren't just in the theatre, throughout the show, many more ads will pop up. The Rockettes are impressive hypothetically, but, really, how many times do you want to watch people doing a kickline, when no one seems like they're having fun and there's no point or story?Yes, you will get highlights of the nutcracker, if done by stuffed animals. But, frankly, I'd rather put on the recording of the nutcracker and have the 1st and 3rd grader who live in my building do the whole thing for me with their stuffed animals. It would have more heart than this heartless, commercialized travesty.There is a sweet story of a mother trying to find the toy her daughter wants. But the moral is that they play a video game together. Not that they volunteer to help someone needy. Or talk to each other. Or bake together. They play a video game (where they don't have to actually <gasp> talk to each other or look at each other) to come together.All in all this is one of the most depressing things I've ever seen. If you want to see what NYC looks like at Christmas time, go for a horse-drawn carriage ride through Central Park (for way less than this), ice-skate in a park and buy hot cider at a local market. Or go window-shopping and buy chestnuts from a street vendor. If you want to celebrate Christmas go see little kids do the Nutcracker anywhere. Or a Sing-Along Messiah. Or see Ahaml and The Night Visitors. Or Midnight Mass. Or buy an advent calendar, set up a creche and read the Bible. Or read a secular story. Or volunteer at a soup kitchen. Or scrapbook with your family. Or do Karaoke and sing with your friends. Or put on fun music and dance with your family. This has as much Christmas spirit as the people who skip Thanksgiving dinner with their family to buy stuff at Wal-Mart."

In fact, all of our party felt the same going in, and by the end every one of us walked out impressed and in a more holiday mood than when we entered. Is it cheesy? Yes, but it's also a fun, colorful, upbeat, entertaining holiday show.The dancers were, of course, pretty amazing, but for me, the star of the show was the staging. In the scene where the Rockettes tour Manhattan, you could swear you're watching a movie and not a stage show. The background imagery and motion of the bus on the stage are so perfectly matched, it felt like a tour of midtown. And the background projection of Santa's workshop was so unbelievably clear and bright, it took me some time to realize it was a projection and not a set. The 3D was also very good. I thought it was a little hokey, but my wife enjoyed the \"video game\" section, which marries dancing, singing and 3D video into a real-life video game.Our party uniformly gave this a thumbs up. I never expected I'd say this, but I think we'll return next year!"

They have re assured me that they could give me a standing seat in same level as I had my tickets. We have ended up on the 3rd orchestra level by the very back door on garden chairs. When I went down to talk to costumer relations they have told me if I don't like it I can exit the show. We have stayed since it was a long trip to get to the city and I have also taken a day off. As I looked around I noticed that there were plenty of seats on my price range that they could have offered, but they didn't since I have bought my tickets from ticketmaster not from them.

I think it is great that the show both embraces all of the great things about Santa Claus and the Christmas spirit and also beautifully covers the true meaning of Christmas. Totally put us in the Christmas Spirit. The Rockettes were amazing and the costumes were gorgeous! Liked that they incorporated some cool new 3D features. The only downside I could possibly think of would be that they could benefit from more bathroom facilities...forget about trying to go after the show (unless you are a guy of course). The line took up the entire downstairs. A little chaotic when the show gets over with people all over the place going in their own directions, but were very very organized and seamless when getting to our seats at the beginning. Loved the show, and would definitely go again in the future!"

When the dancers were not on stage, I wanted to take a nap. My only problem with the entire experience was the crowd control. They crammed everyone in the theater at once with no direction. People were squished in and everyone was going a different direction. Considering the number of performances, they should have this down to a fine art. They need to consult a Disney Imagineer on crowd control before someone gets hurt."

The classic Rockettes numbers hit the mark, and the Christmas scene at the end is an historical part of celebrating Christmas in the city. We arrrived right when the doors opened, and enjoyed having the extra time to check out the deco details of the building. Give yourself that extra time to enjoy the overall experience of this New York landmark.

There was a constant stream of people entering the theatre fully 20 minutes into the show, people who are there not because they want to be but because they got in on the cheap, a couple in front of us who were clearly drunk arrived at 8.20pm and then got up and then got top-ups for their drinks twice during the show and what time they did spend watching the show they were talking and giggling all the way through.Absolutely no consideration for others.What disappointed me was the theatre having no way of controlling when people could take their seat despite the interruption they caused, when paying $100 for a seat it's a little annoying that others get to sit right in front of you at a fraction of the price you paid only for them to ruin the nights entertainment for many people.The show itself is fantastic but I'm not sure we'll make the effort next year...."

The radio city music hall Christmas show is a fabulous attraction for all ages, religions, sexes.It is joyful, fun, interesting, exciting and a lot more adjectives.

Although the performance ends on a religious theme, that is a small part of the show and I believe anyone of any religion can enjoy it. One caveat---I think it would help if you were familiar with the songs and they are mostly well-known American Christmas songs. Knowing the tunes help alot. But they seem to have a lot of foreigners in the audinece and everyone loved it. You will leave the theater feeling happier."

When we were walking up to the theater, we noticed a long line of people out front, who lucky for us, hadn't bought their tickets yet (I was worried that it was the line to get in). We were directed to the ticketholders' entrance, bags checked, etc. Inside, there were concessions, Christmas souvenirs, a candy counter, wine/beer/soft drink concessions. Pictures with a Rockette or Santa Claus were available near the stairs for the first mezzanine or all the way downstairs, respectively. Our seats were first mezzanne, about three rows up, a little to the right of center, which for the price we paid were adequate. The theater inside is beautiful - medium lighting to create a certain kind of holiday ambiance. (I got some practice with low-level lighting images - non-flash - with my Nikon D5100). I did notice that there were people taking pictures with flash cameras - supposedly flash photography is disallowed and strictly enforced, but that's not what I saw. I feel bad for the people who might have been distracted by this behavior. The show itself was great - 3D glasses, lights, dancing, and singing. There is a loose storyline that had something to do with a mother wanting to get some kind of a doll for her daughter. Afterwards, we bought a Christmas tree ornament and took a picture with Santa Claus."

Many were filming the show with their I-phones. This was a distraction. This show has become a tourist attraction not worth the price.

Every time I see the show I purchase another one. Waiting in line for the free popcorn and water/soda was a joke. They ran out of soda, had warm bottles of water, and the popcorn was salty. I don't think they should offer these for free. By the time we got the water and popcorn, found our seats, sat down, the lights dimmed. That was too close for me. I like to have a few minutes before any show starts. The show was stimulating with the 3D glasses and the new video game which I have not seen before. The precision of the Rockettes is just incredible. I love the toy soldiers dance, the way they fall down like dominos is unlike anything I have ever seen in a show. I enjoyed seeing the costumes from the 50's, and 60's, etc. Of course the Nutcracker seen is delightful. I thoroughly enjoyed the show and will see it again in the future.

The sparking brilliance of the crystal Christmas tree at the foyer, the bling all around, the plush loos, the absolutely red carpet welcome from the staff and the comfortable seats. The whole place was awesome.The show in itself was absolutely amazing too! The lighting, the special effects, the 3d show, the music, and above everything the Rockettes! For someone who lovessssss Christmas music, this was custom built to completely wow you! It does get a little too kiddie at times with the dancing santas but I guess they do have to cater to the entire crowd. Overall well worth the money and time spent! I loved every minute of the performance."

The nut cracker was adorable, the High kicks great but my highlight was the toy soldiers sequence. Amazing and I can't describe to anyone how fabulous it was.

The show is the best part of the Christmas season in NYC. It shouldn't be missed by anyone at any age. Bathrooms are crowded, so plan accordingly.Food and souvenirs are priced like they would be at the circus or an amusement park. I get promotional codes for the on-line store, and order my daughter something for Christmas each year after she has seen the show and looked at the souvenirs.I recommend sitting in Orchestra 3, 4, or 5 in seats from LL to TT, but not in front of or behind those rows.

For the past two years my teenage granddaughter and I spent Thanksgiving weekend in the Big Apple sightseeing and shopping. Another reason for our visit was to experience the Christmas Show at Radio City Music Hall. Seeing the Rockettes lives on stage is an absolute thrill. Their precision is always impressive. However, the Christmas Show this year was the exact same show we saw in 2011, nothing added - nothing changed. Even the dance routines performed by the Rockettes and their costumes were the same as the ones we saw last season. I was especially surprised because the Rockettes celebrated their 85th anniversary this year so I expected something commemorative would be added. \"Santa\", the show's MC, only made a brief reference to the 85th anniversary. We wanted to make the Christmas Show an annual event as part of our holiday NYC trip but we will be skipping Radio City next year."

I hadn't seen the show in nearly ten years but was in town with my parents, spouse, niece, and in-laws (who had never seen it at all), when we were able to get $300 orchestra seats for $79 each. The seven of us were very excited. The theater was just as beautiful as I remembered and the show had some new acts, including 3D segments. Unfortunately, a group men arrived late and were seated right and front of us, effectively obstructing each of our views of about half of the stage. Though I can't really fault any particular aspect of the show itself, overall it just failed to meet my expectations. In retrospect, I feel it was only worth $30 p/person if I had to put a value to it. Interestlingly enough, about five of the seven of us confessed after the show that they had difficulty staying awake, even I frequently found my attentiveness drifting, though none of us was fatigued prior. I guess it is something to behold once in a lifetime, or maybe it's better for children. But for four seniors, two adults, and one teenager, it just fell short."

If you are in NYC during November and December, see the Rockette's Christmas Spectacular. 85 years and going strong, it is a little piece of Americana. Beautiful theater and a fantastic show. A little something for everyone. We had great seats and there was plenty of leg room. Just like other reviewers, know that the show was not sold out and with such a great venue, you need not pay as high of a price as you think to get a good view. It is a family-orientated show so we did have two children behind us kicking seats and playing with their light-up, overpriced battery operated souvenirs throughout the entire show. With the mad crush to get everyone into the theater we had little time to pause and take a walk around. Shows are booked pretty close together so if you are interested in really looking at the great old place, book the behind the scenes tour that is offered."

While the building itself and its magnificient chandelier are reliably stunning, the production was a disappointment. Very little playing of the fantastic theatre organ. The opening is slow and the cheery \"We Need A Little Christmas\" and other orchestral holiday tunes are gone. The Rockettes are terrific as usual but the very long dance number is just too long. Thankfully, the Nutcracker, Dancing Santas and Wooden Soldiers numbers were left in. Then the mom/shopping sequence brings back all the holiday worries and pressure that you're trying to get rid of!! And the video game sequence---well it's long and for anyone over 45---it's boring and strange. The 3D effects are fun but not in the video game. Personally, I don't want any shooting in my Christmas show. And the Rockettes in the tour bus? That is very long and ...why aren't they on their feet? ...the overall effect no longer has the masterful buildup to the commanding and deep male voice describing the Nativity at the end. A few smiles during the show, especially for the dancing Santas, but overall, a disappointment. Many seats downstairs in the main rows were empty. The producers need to install a show that is more evenly-paced, inspiring and more of an escape from holiday stress like the show once was. I think most attendees are repeat visitors who know the old show well."

It's fun for the kids to play with. You could also get your children's picture with Santa Claus before the show in front of a fireplace setting.

My kids wanted to see it so I got great seats from tkts and a discounted rate. The show was great, kids loved it. Just the right length. Definitely worth seeing if in NYC during the holidays. The bus sequence was my favorite, along with the classic solider march."

There was a great buzz around the place with people wiring to get in. Inside the huge chandelier shone brightly and took our breath away. The hall was huge and we got 3D glasses to use for certain parts of the show. On came the Rockettes with music and dancing. The atmosphere was great with all the Christmas tunes. Santa Claus was a big part of ref show with a Christmas Story including a nativity scene which wax lovely. This is s great family Christmas show not to be missed when in the big Apple. Thoroughly enjoyed by all the family."

Every scene was amazing - you can watch the rockettes all day they are so beautiful and fascinating. 3 D aspects were fun and well put together. I cant really pick a favorite part of the show. nativity scene had real animals - camels , sheep and a donkey - my kids were thrilled!cast was fabulous and so were all the costumes.Try to get a seat in the orchestra to really enjoy your experience.sign up on the website for upcoming deals and steals , i finally paid only $ 64 for an orchestra seat Row W but teh view was great. radio city itself is impressive so take time to enjoy the foyer before you go in.Unfortunately i picked a 10 Am showing on a sunday and it was filled with parents bringing their 3 year olds who could not care less about a show of that nature - my advice is to pick a night show with a mostly adult audience.I was annoyed that they sold some light up toy at the souvenir store before teh show , so hundreds of kids flashing while the show is going on is distracting.souvenir book is $ 20 cash only. Thank you Rockettes for an unforgettable day - every kid in teh world should have the fortune of seeing this show."

This show is a perfect way to get into the Christmas spirit. We recommend this to everyone of all ages. I do think, however once you see it, it's not worth seeing every year. Its great for kids, couples or friends and family. What a show! They have even incorporated 3D which enhances the experience as well. Show last an hour and a half with no intermission."

The show was great. Some of the routines were a little long for a 3 year old, but overall this was a truly spectacular Christmas show. We live 1 hour outside of NYC. We drove into the city and parked on the street( not easy to do), but if you get there early, some garages have specials. We walked to Times Square after the show to see the Disney Characters and take pictures. Our grandson loved this, but they do ask for a donations if you take pictures with them. Overall a great day.You can buy souvenirs for 20-30$"

The show was fast colourful and gave me the feeling of Christmas when I was younger. My Aunty who is in her late 70s said it was her favorite show that she has ever seen and she goes to London to see shows often. There is no break and it on for about an hour and half long so be ready for that. It doesn't matter what seat you book there is a good views from all around the theatre. Please don't go to New york this Christmas without seeing the show. I was told that the show changes every year so I might go back to New York again in a few years just to go again. Happy holiday and please treat you and your friends /family to a lovely amazing show <3."

Then they spent the whole time talking and video taping the performance. I was surprised the usher who continually walked by let them do that. It was annoying to the rest of us around them. I finally leaned over and asked them to stop and be quiet. We did express this to a supervisor after the performance and he apologized. Next time, sorry but I'm not moving!"

The hall, celebrating its 85th anniversary was wonderfully decked out for the season. We walked around a few times to take it all in before going to our seats.The show was really very good the highlight being, of course, the Rockettes.

It was consistent and magical, and I looked forward to it every year. The last time I saw it was 2001. For the past ten years I have been dreaming of taking my kids to the show. This year they were finally old enough and we had saved enough money for the VERY expensive tickets and weekend in NYC. I have been talking about the show and my childhood memories of it for weeks. WHAT A LET DOWN! The show is nothing like it used to be. While the Rockettes are still great, and the Toy Soldier routine is good, the rest just wasn't. Whose idea was it to replace the classic Dickens' Christmas Carol scenes with a 3-D video game? I LOVED the scenes with Scrooge and Tiny Tim. The new video game scene and \"Frantic Holiday Mom\" scenes did not even remotely compare. The whole thing felt disconnected. Even the live nativity scene has lost its splendor. We spent almost $400 on tickets for the show, and sadly, this is not a show I need to see again. I am so disappointed. This was one classic that didn't need updating!"

However for me, I'd never been so it was all new to me and let me tell you, it was the best show that I've seen on broadway. Our favourite was the toy soldiers and we haven't enjoyed 3D in the past but really enjoyed this. The bus drive through NYC was also wonderful. Music, sets, costumes, singing, video game, dancing, something for everyone! One reviewer mentioned the religious content seemed a lot-really?! 5 minutes was a lot? One scene which I'm not a religious person at all but felt this was done well; great costumes, live animals, pretty great stuff. If anything I felt it didn't fit. Everything else was so upbeat and it was more somber. Oh we'll I guess they want to have something for everyone and they most certainly do. We loved it and HIGHLY recommend it!"

We had seats in the highest possible section, but the show and theatre are so well arranged, you don't feel that you are missing out on anything. The shows start PROMPTLY at the time listed on your ticket. My only complaint is that they let families into the theatre after the show started, and not betweeen songs in the show, just whenever they get there. Two families of five were crawling all over each other to get to their correct seats, which happened to be the two rows directly in front of me. There were two ushers there, and they even had to bring a manager over. It was very distracting and unfair to a paying customer who managed to get to their seat on time. I went to a matinee show, so maybe I should have expected more noisy kids to be there, I just thought Radio City would have handled the situation better. Still, great show and a lovely time overall."

We hadn't been to the Radio City Christmas Show in well over a dozen years, but we decided our two granddaughters, 3 and 6, were probably old enough to appreciate it . . . and, boy, they did. They loved it. The dancers are as great as ever and the toy soldier number is still perfect, especially the ending. And the live animal nativity scene was a hit too. If you have young girls who take dance class, there is no doubt it's worth a special trip during the holiday season.I also need to really thank the ticket staff at Radio City; they can't be beat!! Somehow, I screwed up the dates on my ticket order and never bothered to check them. We all showed up at the 51st Street 'ticket holders' entrance and when our tickets were scanned, they were rejected. It took the ticket lady a minute or so to figure out what was wrong; they were for the night before. Before I could even begin to kick myself for being stupid, she reached out and grabbed my arm and said, \"Oh, don't worry, Sir. We can fix this. You just need to talk to my supervisor right over there.\" Feeling a little sheepish, explained what happened to the supervisor, and she said, \"Easy fix, Sir,\" and was on the radio to an inside supervisor. In less than five seconds she told me she had to keep my tickets, but walked all of us through the line and told us to go inside, up one floor, and see John. By the time we got to John, he was waiting and had already set up five special seats for our group in a small alcove like corner at the rear of the 1st Mezzanine. The view was great, and the girls could stand and move around with out bothering anyone. What a great group of people!!"

My mum was really looking forward to watching this but we actually walked out half way through it was that bad! Unoriginal dance, and totally ruined swan lake with ballet dancers dressed up in oversized animal costumes. The only redeeming factor was the orchestra. It's no wonder two thirds of the seats in the stalls were unsold. Spend your money on a far better Broadway show!"

I did like the projections across the ceiling of designs. They had two organists who popped out at the end which was cool. The highlight for me was the building! Loved the murals and the awesome chandeliers and Christmas decorations! I love the Rockettes and RCMH but do realize some parts of the show are a little cheesy. My husband did not really enjoy it - LOL! He's a Southpark fan so he made snarky comments to me which I think entertained him more than the show! Me, I love silly Christmas stuff so I enjoyed!"

I had some visitors over from Ireland at Christmas and I'd never been to the Radio City Chrismas Spectacular myself in the 3 years I've lived in NYC. So, decided this would be the ideal opportunity. Maybe it was because we went in with such high expectations, but we unanimously thought the show was disappointing and failed to keep our interest throughout. I found myself glancing at my watch after 15 mins and was glad when the curtain came down. We were also a little surprised at the religious aspects, not bothered by it as a group of Irish catholics of course...just surprised! There are some good bits, mainly when the Rockettes are on stage but overall I would rate this as an unsatsifying NYC experience (for adults!)."

The theme was \"magic\" and it was accompanied by alot of gregorian chant like music. Kind of dark and creepy and the baby (prop) that feel into the magical well remained trapped inside, apparently a three legged monster so when you left, it felt a little unresolved. The actual circus acts were, as usual, phenomenal, but the visual and auditory onslaught that accompanied it were not uplifting. You just kind of shook your head and said \"wow\" at the end. Then went scurrying into the night to find a quiet place to rest."

I must say that I've seen three other shows in various cities, Totem, Quidam and Ovo and this show didn't compare with the others in terms of \"ooh and ahh\" moments. It was a good show, but I wasn't wowed to the level I usually am with Cirque. Radio City Music Hall isn't the best venue for this type of show either. The seats are all level, so it's difficult to see the stage when someone is sitting in front of you. The space between the seats is really narrow, so you're either stepping on someone's feet or getting yours stepped on unless you stand up. Many people came in late and didn't sit down right away. This made it difficult to view and enjoy the show. Overall the show was good, but I've been to better."

It keeps you at the edge of your seat, amazed at the acrobats tumbling through the air and giggling at the silly antics of the clowns. The acts are just long enough to keep you interested without becoming tiresome. The costumes and sets take your breath away, and that's before the various apparatuses used to complete the tricks! As an added bonus, Radio City is a beautiful setting for a show. The theater is a masterpiece in itself. I definitely recommend getting to see this one before is closes down. Discount tickets are available at livingsocial.com. We sat in the fourth row mezzanine and the view was perfect."

The theatre is beautiful inside, it's easy to imagine going there many years ago when it was THE place to see a show. And I can't say enough wonderful things about the show - it was fabulous. I was enthralled and thoroughly entertained. Good fun for the whole family. See it before it closes in September!"

The two Broadway shows lasted about 2 1/2 hours, where Zarkana was only 75 minutes long. The woman next to me actually asked, \"do you think that's it?\" Also, I had no idea about the back story, and the story is told in a language other than english. Free programs weren't provided, so you are stuck purchasing a program if you want to learn about the performers and the story. I ended up Google searching Zarkana after I got home."

The show did not disappoint and my kids loved in (11 and 9). I also heard smaller children laugh a lot throughout the show so don't be afraid they are too young (I'd say 5-6 and above would be just right). The performers were fantastic, the sets gorgeous and constant action captivating. Cirque du Soleil always makes me feel like I'm in the middle of a really awesome dream, I'm not quite sure how they do it, but they do. The highlight for me was the Sand Art - absolutely amazing - I would have paid just to see her for an hour and a half!"

While there are a number of bad reviews - it's a great overall show and fantastic venue if you've never seen Radio City Music Hall. The show itself is very typical Cirque - clowns, acrobats, gymnysts and lots of great visuals and technology. It's not fair to compare this show to the Vegas shows which have their own catered theatre. We had a discounted coupon for the show so we paid 40% than the face value. While there are a few scarier scenes, there's enough here to keep a young child (6+) focused and excited. Having never been to Radio City Music Hall before, i had no concept of where to sit. We ended up in center section \"E\" and row \"F\" which is about 20 rows back from the front when you factor in the orchestra seats. Perfect seats - I think anywhere in the centre on the main level works. Unlike other Cirque shows, very little little happens away from the stage or in the air so no need to sit up higher or further away."

The stunts and tricks are marvellous. It is a very very entertaining show - good for both kids and adults. The deep and wide stage of the Radio City Hall provides an excellent place for the performance. You may see similar stunts and tricks in other cirques. But, the one is more creative to put the stunts and tricks together. The only minor downside is that they keep on playing the same 20-second melody (for 20-30 mins) before the show began. It became quite disturbing. Oh, just a small tip in case it is your first to visit the Radio City Music Hall - you should also go to see the restroom in the basement. It has a huge powder room that you will not find in other performing venues."

This is a presentation of Cirque du Soleil and we enjoyed it immensely! We had no idea what language it was in, but that was not important! The acrobats, tumblers, clowns and the whole cast were totally entertaining. The costumes are wonderful and the set design is great too.

First of all, Radio City is amazing, certainly one of the greatest theaters in the world, and is a real attraction itself. Zarkana itself was thrilling, with amazing staging lighting and effects that really took advantage of all the space. I found the \"story\" a bit elusive, but it isn't really about the story. The circus acts were all great, and pretty much like other CdS acts I've seen. I enjoyed the music as always, but at times it was a rock concert volume, much too loud for an elderly guest I went with. Otherwise, the colors are lurid, and there's an element of darkness and menace about the whole thing that I found slightly off-putting. It didn't have the charm that other CdS shows I've seen ad in abundance. Still it's a magnificent production and I'd certainly recommend it with the caveat that it might not be so good for very young children or elderly guests who like things a bit more restrained. Also I got discounted tickets on goldstart.com, which seems to be a good deal."

The set designs were amazing to me in Zarkana with clever use of screens lights and tied in to the performers - very clever and creative effect. there are 2 tight rope walkers who also perform in a double ring contraption and are a wonder in balance - they manage to jump rope on both the tight rope and the metal ring which was incredible.. My favorite performer was the girl who draws pictures in sand. I have never seen any talent like this in any part of the world and was fascinated by her! Many others that held my awe were the male contortionist and a couple using a ladder to do stunts. There are also trapeze artists and a group of humanist that stack themselves in all kinds of ways. I also liked the juggler at the opening. There were a few misses as others have mentioned but they were minor and in no way took away from overall show. Clowns were funny and entertaining,too.

In Auguest 2009 my family and I went to NYC because Radio City was having a kick off to the holiday season and there wasa kickline that was going through 5th ave and it was going snow for us. When the rockettes came out they did their famous kicks and they said who ever had a pink bracelet come out and join the kickline so cool did that and very awsome experence after we did the kick the first 200 people that had done the kickline will get free tickets to the show i was very Excited. My family always wanted to seethis show. Then in 2010 they did the same thing but no tickets. So my mom saw on the computer that optimum was having a contest to win free tickets to the show but you also get a backstage door very cool. My mom won and got the ticktes and went and saw the show. I recommend this show its a christmas spectular and its a family show that the family will love!!!!"

Radio City is an incredible theatre, and the performance was absolutely jaw dropping! Less thrilled with noisy neighbors who had to comment on every aspect of the performance, and people who had no problem making half a row stand up to let them leave their seat in the middle of the show, but you can find jerks anywhere, I suppose. The performers were absolutely amazing, my favorite was the man/woman team who both walked up a ladder (with no supports) then the woman balanced on his shoulders as she took another ladder and climbed to the top it! My sons actually enjoyed the clowns (we are not big clown fans here). Everyone should see this show once - it was truly amazing!"

We paid well over $100 per ticket and we must say we have been to $5 circuses that were better run! People, whole rows, were being seated 30 minutes, even 45 minutes into the performance. Then again one whole row that was seated 45 minutes into the performance decided they wanted snacks and drinks and again stood all at once to exit and then returned one at a time so each time the whole row rose again. This is just one example of the rude activity that went on during the whole performance. If this is what goes on at Radio City on a regular bases, Cirque du Soleil should reconsider their connection with this facility. We complained to management afterwards and presented it as a constructive comment from concerned patrons and were told to get over it and contact Cirque du Soleil directly because that is how they do business at Radio City!"

You can't take any food or beverages in with you and they check your bag upon entry. Water was reasonably priced inside though. Don't be afraid of waiting for the toilet after the show as it moves very quickly for so many people lining up. Such a beautiful old worlde charm that you can imagine the era that it was built in.

People were coming in constantly for the first 15 mins of the show and intermittently all through. Shockingly bad manners. Theatre staff seem to think it's normal...The stalls are not very sloped.

Recommend springing the extra money for good seats, as close to middle as possible about 8th to 12th row. Because of the big dance numbers you don't want to be too close.I had to take off 1 star for Radio City for The Living Navity because Radio City took away the very moving, \"One Solitary Life\". I do miss some of the old numbers like Marshmallow World and I understand they need to update shows from time to time but I believe taking away \"One Solitary Life' was a sad misstep.Radio City itself is a wonder to behold. Arrive a little early so you can look around. If you are off season, take the backstage tour. It is very interesting. If you are there for Christmas season, then of course you want to see the tree at Rockefeller City mere steps away. Check out the store displays on 5th Avenue and St. Patrick's Cathedral. If you have a little girl, American Girl Doll is in the neighborhood also. For lunch, tea or dinner with dolls in attendance, you will need advance reservations.Make your special day at Radio City Music Hall complete by adding other things to do in the city. For dinner, I recommend Carmines on 44th street just off Times Square. Family style Italian. Reservations a must.Radio City Music Hall and the Rockettes are American Icons. Not to be missed !"

We saw the 'real' Santa at Macys, the Christmas Tree @ Rockefeller Center, watched Ice Skating, Horse Carriage ride in Central Park (nice but you feel bad for the horses), FAO Schwarts, ToysRUs, American Girl store, Mary Poppins, great restaurants, great hot chocolate and coffee, Zabars Deli, we walked all over. Probably the most favorite was going to the Radio City Christmas Spectacular (Rockettes) which was fabulous! It was fun to get all dressed up and go. Our daughter didn't move and LOVED every minute of the show. We bought the DVD and she still loves watching it. Wish this could be an annual tradition!"

The actors, dancers,singers on stage are always very professional and do such an amazing job during their performances. The orchestra is also fantastic. It's always amazing to watch the Rockettes perform as well. Tickets are pricey for shows at Radio City Music Hall, but if you've never been it's worth the price to experience it at least once."

My stepson's girlfriend is a Rockette so, never having thought to see this show, we went and saw her perform along with the other lovely incredible young ladies in their amazing sparkly costumes (the swarvoski-draped \"bathing suits\" cost $9K each she said). Despite sharing Radio City Music Hall with 6,000 others, we had seats good enough to see everything and understand what was going on. The scenes are very well done, the songs cheerful and appropriate and this is just plain good old fashioned family entertainment with some amazing dancing. I recommend springing for the more expensive tickets to get closer. Nice thing is you can take your drink into the auditorium with you (although they don't know how to mix a martini -- yes, in NYC! -- so I had a rum and coke instead). Don't miss this!"

After doing a backstage tour of Radio City a couple of years ago I have dreamt of going to their all-american, all-singing, all-dancing Christmas show and lucky me went this Christmas! The setting of the show is fabulous enough - beautifully restored art deco building in the middle of manhattan where every seat is a great seat (and there's 10,000 of them - it's the largest indoor theatre in the world I believe), the Rockettes - the most amazing dancers and the clever staging all added up to a once in a lifetime experience for me and my family. Even our cynical older teens enjoyed it. Needless to say it doesn't come cheap - we paid nearly $100 per seat but it was worth it.If your budget doesn't stretch to that, then the backstage tour is well worth it and you get to see the beautiful building without loads of people in it - it's absolutely stunning."

While the Rockettes, in my opinion, mostly just performed very simple moves, those were done quite professionally and were pleasant to watch. There was no plot, just seemingly unrelated songs/dances with the only thing in common being Christmas theme. Some performances were quite boring, meant for kids only. For example, The Nutcracket scene with mice and teddy bears performing ballet in fat suits was quite strange, as you obviously cannot appreciate ballet without seeing the graceful moves, which in this case were buried under the fat suits. I think most kids liked the show, I would say it is a decent thing to check off your list when visiting New York with kids. As an adult New Yorker, this was my first time seeing the show, and I'm not planning to return any time soon.A note on the timing - be sure to come at least 45 min prior to the show, there is a line to get in, and although we had premium seat and did not have to wait in line, there was still a lot to do prior to the show (take pictures, etc)."

The Rockettes were gorgeous - high-kicking their way through exacting routines all produced faultlessly with a fantastic live orchestra and chorus. Each new scene was more jaw dropping than the next. We were called upon to put on 3D glasses for a couple of numbers, a skating rink turned up in another, fire works were fired in another and the live nativity scene was complete with sheep, superbly dressed camels, donkeys and a pre-raphaelite angel suspended in the sky with 20ft wings that... yes... flapped!

This past Friday we attended the 1:00 pm matinee show at Radio City Music Hall, and we were all impressed at the special effects during the show (3-D) and of course the Rockettes! The entire show is enjoyable and full of music & talent that won't dissapoint anyone in the entire family. We arrived 45 minutes early as the show was sold out, however, even with the large crowds, There was plenty of staff to check our tickets and direct us to the proper door/isle to get us to our seats. The entire theater , including the rest rooms was clean and well maintained...It was a pleasure to be inside Radio City Music Hall again! This show as well as the Music Hall is a Timeless Classic and should not be missed by both native New Yorkers and Tourists, it is truly a part of a \" New York Christmas\" ! Overall Rating of the Music Hall & Christmas Spectacular Show ~ Very Good!"

There were even a couple of 3D numbers that worked surprisingly well. The show held our four year old daughters attention throughout -- that's ninety minutes with no intermission and a travel weary four year old who had been on the move for ten hours up to the show. It was all you would expect. Santa, glitz, singing, dancing, and even some impressive ice skating. The classics (kicking, toy soldier number, Santa) were great to finally see in person. I'm not much for musical theater or dance routines, but I was thoroughly entertained for the entire show. There are some reasonably priced souvenirs in the lobby as well as some more expensive ones. A quick tip -- if you need the facilities or a quick snack, the third mezzanine area is much less crowded than downstairs. There are several elevators to zip you up there as well."

I was really impressed with the projectors around the theater, but I didn't care for the 3d tv as much. To me, this show is about the talent of the performers and the musicians. It isn't about special effects and huge tv's. Overall though, this was THE most popular thing we did on our trip. Great job guys. Radio City Music Hall is such a gem in NYC, and its awesome to think how many people have enjoyed the great performances in this beautiful and legendary venue."

The rockettes used to be an enjoyable experience for all but now it has turned into a complete childrens performance. This years newest part of the show included the rockettes fighting off ginger bread men while a mother and daughter play a video game. Certain parts of the show were also in 3-D. If I wanted to go see a 3-D movie I would have gone to an IMAX. The show has turned its attention away from the rockettes- the reason we all come to watch."

She loved the whole thing from beginning to end. She was mesmerized by the Rockettes and loved the birth of Jesus act at the close. In my opinion, the only bad part of the show was the 'video game' scene which was an attempt to connect with todays kids which is not necessary as Santa and the 3-D do that well enough. As an adult, I really was impressed with the use of technology in the show and the coordination between the Rockettes. The venue is really spectacular. Seats are comfortable, sat in the orchestra about 2/3rds the way back and it was unobstructed by anyone or anything in front of us. I scoff at the price of the tickets (more about the $16.75 'fees' which is just Ticketmaster's way of making more money ontop of the already $100 ticket) and the $18.50 for 2 pretzels and 2 20-oz cokes, but otherwise, it was a great show."

The show began well, but could have been jazzed up in a few parts.Sleigh Ride - Rockettes in reindeer costumes performed in perfect precision - kind of cool how they took the reins of Santa's sleigh.Santa Flies to New York - Nice seeing animated sights of New York, but Universal studios does a much better 3-D.The Twelve Days of Christmas - great tap number again with perfect precision and interesting groupings. The dancers demonstrated their incredible stamina.The Nutcracker - probably perfect for the younger set, but a little boring for fans of the ballet.The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers - quite fascinating, especially when they topple.New York at Christmas - OK, but not thrilling.Department Store, Here Comes Santa Claus, Closer Than You Know, Santa's Video Game, Closer Than I Knew - story meant to tug at the heart strings and emphasize the true meaning of Christmas - quite predictable and boring. Could have been executed differently, replaced with something else or cut.Let Christmas Shine - Classic Rockettes - Great!The Living Nativity - Colorful and quite spectacular!Joy to the World - OK, not an amazing finale.Usually this type of show would bring a tear or two to the eye, but not this time. Maybe I'm just jaded from seeing so many great performances in NY in the past, but I didn't have the experience I had hoped to have. Additionally, the number of restroom facilities available was completely inadequate - the lines were horribly long. Leaving the venue was a total nightmare - complete chaos and congestion.Families with small children may enjoy this show tremendously, but there are many, many more interesting ways to spend your afternoon in NYC."

They had this one backdrop that revealed the inside of a house with a huge tree tucked beside a window-I'm telling you, that thing looked so real-with the tree being lit, and the windows sparkling from the reflection of lights. It was so gorgeous. They have fantastic scences. If you have never gone to Sight and Sound in Lancaster, it's worth a trip. I would rate Sight and Sound a 10 and this show a 9.5. Only because Sight and Sound has so many live animals and backdrops that are so real as well. Any show at Sight and Sound is awesome. And of course, this show is what I have to compare it to. If you are looking for a place to eat near RCMH, I would highly recommend Stardust, on Broadway. It's nothing fancy, it's a diner, but the experience is so much fun. The waiter and waitress's get on the table and sing.........and they have so much talent. Some have gone on to bigger and better things. You have to have a voice to work there, because they were all top notch. I got a turkey club, that didn't come with mayo. Fries were really good. Was a fun and upbeat experience. It was very crowded and tight at 11:30 am. Is worth the entertainment within a 50's diner.We were on a bus trip, so we didn't have tons of time to eat. But if you want NICE, go to the View Restaurant that is on Broadway, within the Mariott Hotel-I think. It's a revolving restaurant, that is very upscale. Very expensive, but worth putting it on your list of things you did."

I've never seen such a thing live. What I liked was the throwback to stage shows of 80 years ago and combining that with newer concepts such as the 3D presentations. Unless you are exceptionally jaded, I think you will like this show. Hint: Don't pay for the $125 tickets that are up front, get the $75 tickets that are right up against the more expensive seats. Not only does it save you money, but being slightly further back lets you take in the full view of the stage and its surroundings."

The many children in the audience were very well behaved and couldn't take their eyes off the stage. I would not recommend this for children younger than 4.

They allowed late arrivals to block the aisles while trying to find their seat. This went on for about 15 minutes into the show. At one point one of the ushers got into a verbal argument over a seat. I was shocked at the number of late arrivals that disrupted the first part of the beautiful show. The show is about 90 minutes in duration so 15 minutes of disruption was substantial. There really needs to be a policy concerning people that arrive late or a procedure to get them to their seats with little disruption to the show."

That being said, it's one of those type of shows where you would go to only once because there truly isn't anything breathtaking. You can only take a few minutes of the famous kicks until it gets pretty old. There also seems to be too much talking throughout the show, which is very uninteresting. However, if you are in the Christmas spirit and want to watch a nice, well choreographed production, then be sure to check out the Rockettes."

I'd say it's worth seeing once...the theater, the Rockettes, the snippet of 3d movie, and the living Nativity especially...but the blatant merchandising and souvenir hawking takes away from the experience. Wherever you look in the theater, people have glow-in-the-dark containers filled with popcorn or sugar or cocktails. Besides, how many times can you say \"wow! They're all dancing in unison!\"? I guess you just have to be in the mood, but, to me, it felt more like a ride at Disney than a show in NYC.P.S. If you decide to see it, don't pay extra to be up close...you get the full effect much better from further away."

The show had a great mixture of entertainment from Santa Claus with some help from our 3D glasses to the spectacular dancing of the Rockettes. The show moves along quickly and the length of the show which is just about 90 mintues was fine. I ordered the tickets online and even though the seats were up in the second mezzaine they were still very good and everything was easy to see and to hear. The costumes are beautiful. Arrive early because it was very crowded and we had a very rainy night which made it difficult to navigate through the people and umbrellas. A great holiday evening for sure!"

The costuming, set design and the use of technology to enhance the program were top notch. There was even 3 D glasses provided for special segments. \"The Rockettes Magical Journey\" is incredible for both young and old alike. Prior to the show, there were opportunities to have photos taken with Santa in his sleigh and with a Rockette. The picture packages were priced very reasonably and they were really very nice. I would recommend this show to all who love Christmas. I would also recommend paying a little higher price and getting seats closer to the stage. It is well worth it.We plan to make it a yearly family tradition."

However next to this was another line, where if you were going to see the show that was due to start you could walk right in. For $20 you get a programme and a CD of the music featured in the show all in a little bag, which I loved as I like to get a programme from each show I go to see.The show was very entertaining and the Rockettes were fabulous. The 90 minutes went very quick.The only thing that disappointed me was that people were still casually finding their seats once the show had started so sometimes all you could see were their heads and not the stage, in addition to this people seemed to talk through the show quite a lot, I thought the point of seeing a show was to watch not talk! Infact someone was talking so much by us that they got told off by another patron.I'm really glad I saw this as it was an amazing experience and something I would recommend to anyone visiting NY over the Christmas season."

I've seen the show several times. I took a friend for the first time and really hyped up the show... needless to say I was rather dissapointed this time. The Rockettes were wonderful, but it didn't seem like they did as many acts as in the past... The BEST act: the bus - it was awesome, the soldiers (of course!), the ice skaters, Clara, and yes of course, Santa!... Where I was dissapointed was the new 3D video game act... it was very LONG, LOUD (and I wasn't up front), and it didn't seem to fit the \"Spectacular\" \"Christmas\" show that I have seen in the past. I understood the meaning but it didn't impress me or those around me. The other changes were the reindeer act - it seemed like they shorten the act. I remember it being SO awesome and how incredible it was to see the Rockettes do so many neat things with the reindeer costume. Also, the Santa Claus scene... I seem to remember that being different too, either the reindeer or the Santa act had a 3 level part to the act and it was truly awesome to watch.. The nativity scene was different too. When it was over, my friends said \"is this it\"?? :( I felt like I dissapointed them as I had hyped it up so much. Would I go again?? problably, but I wouldn't rush to buy the most expensive tickets like I did this time. My suggestion (if interested), would be to bring back the \"original\" Rockette Christmas Spectacular show.. The previous show was SO traditional - why does everyone feel they need to make a \"change\"? In no way do I mean to be harsh, I just want to share my opinion and hope it is heard... Radio City Christmas Spectacular had a special place in my heart because it was truly a \"Christmas\" spectacular......."

I have been going since i am a little girl with my mom in the days where a movie preceded the show, remember those days?!! Well, aside from the traditions mini performance (Christmas story) the Wooeden Soldiers Rockettes theme sings back in my mind and makes me smile, Santa is the REAL GUY! He's been in the show for 20 plus years taking a break from Christmas preparation and you even get the see the North Pole for the little ones who never have and us young at heart who love to be young at heart. MY FAVORITE scene is the Nativity. In all of Broadway, there is no comparison, in my opinion to the MAGNIFICENT Nativity scene. I went with my girlfriend after many years of taking my 3 daughters with my mom (now young adults and mom in heaven). I hope to take my grandchildren in years to come! I stopped to see Santa and thank him for my many gifts (non material) and told him ......I BELIEVE! your freind, maryellen (51 years young) tip....use the ladies room on the 2nd or 3rd floor even though they direct you downstairs. the wait is much shorter and you wont miss the beginning of the show because you are on line."

Strongly recommend getting there one hour before show starts, if going in the morning plan ahead so that you are not caugth in long lines getting breakfast or snacks for the kids. We parked in the Parkfast location on 44st and was very convenient, $17 plus tax for 12 hours. If going with kids and need to use the bathrooms, beware of huge lines in 1st level just before show starts, go to upper levels and there is less people. Also if coming from out of town, recommend researching options to eat, everything was packed and with long lines in the area close to Rockefeller Plaza, so we ended up walking around for quite some time just to find a place that was family friendly."

However, while walking past Radio City enroute to our dinner I asked a security guard if there was any possibility of getting tickets for the 8:30 show. He said \"sure, just go the the box office.\" Sure enough, we got to great orchestra seats for a wonderful show.So, always check at the box office, you never know what you can get.

First off the product placement of NY Life and Chase Logos throughout the two video portions of the show was so annoying and cheesey. I am surprised they did not display the chase logo over the nativity scene. They incorporated a new video 3d segment in the show replacing the north pole scene. It was awful and threw off the pace of the show.,that when the next number came on which in the past was wonderful, the joy was gone. Even the natvity scene lost it's charm this year. Don't waste your money. The christmas show was always about the pace. It would build up to the nativity. It would lead you up to a high, a place of bliss, sadly that is no longer the case."

Every year it puts me in the Christmas spirit when I leave the show. The last few years there have been some changes for the worse, but this year was horrible! The show now has a video game storyline, a snow monster, humbug cartoon characters, and spinning video lights. I don't know how long the video game storyline was, but I quickly lost interest in the show. I saw a little girl in front of me upset because she was scared of the snow monster. This show should not be scary. Sometimes things stay the same for a reason....people loved the old Christmas show. I heard over and over on my way out of the music hall how people didn't like the new show. If this show continues to decline it will sadly be my last year going. I don't need fireworks, and 3 D glasses and hard to follow story lines. I need the Rockettes and the Christmas cheer that used to be. I would not bring a young child to the show."

Bring back the old story and leave \"video games\" to people who know how to make them.And when is the music hall going to figure out the need for \"family bathrooms\"? I attend with a autistic male child who must be accompanied to the restroom. I am female. And what about a single parent with children of different sexes? Duh.

Radio City Music Hall is one of those historic places you should experience while in New York City. Most tourists only walk by it to take photos and instead opt to see a Broadway show. However, the 2011 Christmas Spectacular may convince you to actually see a show at this historic venue. This show has a casual storyline with tradition Christmas themes. The show includes lots of dancing, singing and this year parts of the show's storyline are in 3-D. There is even a segment of the show's storyline involving a video game a sure favorite with kids and teens. Together these elements really entertained audience member of all ages. I felt like a kid again as I resisted the temptation to reach out and grab the 3-D images floating in front of me. My husband didn't resist. The show's storyline is varied and of course includes many of the classic Christmas stories from the Nutcracker to the Nativity scene. The show of course includes the classic Rockettes dance numbers with the high leg kicks, which I personally enjoyed as I grew up seeing images of the World-Famous Rockettes. The dance numbers and singing were very entertaining and the costumes creative. The show's supporting technology was equality impressive with a first rate lighting experience and the backdrop screen which displayed floor to ceiling images much like the IMAX theaters, I should note that I saw tons of audience members taking photos and videos inside the auditorium. Normally, this is not allowed in theaters, but the show's brochure only said no flash photography, so maybe it is allowed so long as the performers are not distracted. As a side note, downstairs near the bathrooms is a large advertisement for the show. It is a great place to take a group photo and pretend to kick your leg up like a Rockette! We bought Groupon.com discount show tickets at a great price. The tickets were only good for the month of November as the show tends to sell tons of seats in December. Even if you have to pay full price if you are looking for a family friendly show, or just a show to experience Radio City Music Hall, you will not be disappointed with the 2011 Christmas Spectacular. Be sure to arrive early as an entry line does form. If you are picking up tickets from Will Call be sure to arrive in enough time to wait in line, claim your tickets, use the bathroom facilities and get to your seat. The show starts on-time. After the show head across the street to Rockefeller Center to see the ice rink and the famous Christmas tree. You are sure to get in the Christmas spirit after seeing this show!"

The best part they were truly into their specific characters and that made it even more exciting. I read some of the comments written prior, and I cant agree that the show is boring or that some of the performers actually were not able to do the stunts form the first time.

The inside of Radio City Music Hall is lovely and you just know you are sitting in an iconic theater.As always, Cirque went all out. The artists were amazing, the costumes creative and the set stunning.I wish we had taken the bask stage tour. Having never been inside the Hall, I really didn't expect it to be so architecturally detailed. One note - the bathroom was downstairs and FAR too small to accommodate all the women that needed it during the show intermission. One of the ushers did say there was an additional bathroom upstairs but given the line downstairs and the many, many women heading upstairs, we didn't think that would be any better."

I went the day of my show and it cost me about $40 less to do it in person than it was going to cost me by doing it online only 30 minutes before I had decided to go in person. I purchased my tickets midday and the line was less than 6 people. It was my first Cirque du Soleil and my 2nd show at Radio City Music Hall. I sat in the front row of the first mezzanine and I had an excellent view of the entire stage, with a good amount of leg room. Snack and beverage prices inside are costly. I had an average size Willy Wonka chocolate bar for $6. Staff is very helpful along the way to help you find seats/ bathrooms."

The lines were long and security tight, but once in the hall, it was like traveling back in time. The inside of the theatre is gorgeous and we were lucky to get wonderful seats on the isle almost in the center of the theatre. We enjoyed the show, even though it was very modern and \"rocky\". It was colorful and interesting and even though it was difficult to follow the storyline, the acrobatics and aerial numbers were magnificent. The only cloud in our heaven and something which was extremely irritating and should be taken to heart by the administration, is the fact that people were still being shown to their seats by the ushers 20 minutes arter the show began! As i said before, we had wonderful seats but what good does that do if there are people walking in front of you while you are trying to watch the show?Please, Radio City Music Hall, take note of this. It would be more courteous to paying guests are really interested in seeing the show to close the doors and not allow disrespectful latecomers to enter."

Two friends, 50ish, on the pulse of life, love acrobatics (appreciates the danger), loves circus etc. I had never seen a Cirque & always wanted to. HOWEVER, this one did not wow me, mainly b/c of the 'rabbit-dog' creatures that everyone seemed to laugh at & clap for, while not clapping for the daring acrobatics (just a few of us). We just were annoyed by the 'critters' - their squeaky, stupid stuff; there's no real theme or point to the play, music too loud, could not hear words (we were in 3rd floor mezz), just quite annoying both lead male & female singers. We were very disappointed, should have seen a tried & true Tony Award winner - Memphis!"

It's stunning. We were at the hall to see Zarkana - Cirque du Soleil's current offering in New York. It was a good show, but didn't really give me the \"wow\" feeling I was expecting from Cirque. While the stunts and the clowns were great, I had trouble following the plot. The score wasn't all that great either. Maybe I set my expectations too high. No one gave the show a standing ovation (other than the guy in front of us that seemed to love it). Nonetheless, it was a decent show and the chance to see it performed in Radio City Music Hall was worth the cost of the tickets."

Before I went to Zarkana I had seen some other bad reviews on Trip Advisor but decided to take a chance with 1/2 price tickets. I had heard that the show is a bit underwhelming but given that I had never seen a Cirque show before I would give this a chance. After spending ~$210 for 3 tickets- I almost left after intermission. You know it is a bad show when you are thinking that you have been suckered out of your money while you are watching the show. I saw a much better acrobatic show at Sea World (San Diego) .The show does improve after intermission and there are some really fantastic tricks. The talent might be there but the show needs a new director/choreographer. If you do decide to buy tickets- stay for the whole thing or come late and see just the second half. The highlight of the show for me was to see Radio City Music Hall which is an amazing building. The staff is super friendly too."

I trust my opinion of this show because I did not preview TripAdvisor before making reservations but, rather, read earlier submissions the day after having seen it. I base my opinion on a comparison between Zarkana and LaNouba since LaNouba was our first Cirque de Soliel. Unlike some reviewers, I was WOWed by Radio City Music Hall! We live a mere 100 miles South and have been there several times, over-the-years, but we are NOT avid theater-goers, I must concede. We were amazed at the staging and visual-effects of the show which stood-up well against the incredible special-effects we are used-to in today\u2019s movies and videos. The magnificent Radio City Music Hall and the stage-crew get an \u201cA\u201d for this production. As for the rest, I must agree with the other reviews.The performers are, well, world-class circus performers, if anything, their skill and artistry is overshadowed, somewhat, by the sights and sounds of Zarkana. Speaking of Zarkana: I didn\u2019t know what it meant BEFORE I watched the show and I STILL don\u2019t know what it was about. It had something to do with SNAKES, though, a sort of a \u201cMedusa\u201d deal and there was an interlocutor and he was always singing loudly to some girl who was way-up in the rafters and didn\u2019t come down till the Finale. I suppose he had a good voice but I didn\u2019t come to a circus to hear songs. Maybe I\u2019m a lowbrow but I found myself grimacing every time the guy walked out on to the stage between acts. And speaking of \u201cbetween acts\u201d I don\u2019t get the comedic-duo that comes on between acts. I think it\u2019s a French \u201cCirque\u201d touch, \u2018cause they had them in Orlando, too, but the \u201cTom & Jerry\u201d routine got \u201cold\u2019 for me by the time I\u2019d reached the age of reason. I guess they\u2019re \u201ccharming.\u201dThe acrobats, gymnasts, trapeze-artists and jugglers are superb and sure to please, to one extent or another, depending upon which you enjoy seeing more of, i.e. although trapeze and tight-rope artists are breath-taking, I prefer jugglers and cyclists (or other mechanical apparatuses) AND I\u2019ve never \u201cgotten\u201d the concept of so many things going-on at-once. One focuses on a performer and misses all the others doing stuff at the same time. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like three-ring-circuses.Where was I? Oh, Yeah! I recommend Zarkana. I had a feeling that LaNouba was a little more intimate but that may be due to the venue. There\u2019s no character to match \u201cThe Green Bird.\u201d I haven\u2019t fallen-in-love with a cartoon character since I was a child. My Sweetie\u2019s evaluation of Shakespeare\u2019s plays comes to mind, \u201cToo Many WORDS!\u201d when I search for a description of Zarkana\u2026\u201cToo Much SINGING!\u201d"

Not sure that the most important aspect of any Cirque du Soleil performance is the plot anyway. One of the undoubted 'stars' of the show is the Radio City Theatre itself which is simply magnificent. Beyond that the story of Zarkana is little more than a vehicle for the very best that this magical form of surreal circus has to offer and everything is there in this celebration of human spirit, creativity, imagination and sheer agility. Forget the slightly dated though well performed vocals and the slightly incomprehensible plot and just enjoy quality musicianship, magnificent sets and startlingly good acrobatics. Well worth a visit."

            "review": "Zarkana at Radio City - Awful Show!!!. I have seen pretty much every Cirque show that has opened in the last 20+ years, except for Zed and Viva Elvis. Every time Cirque opens a new show in NY it is a sell out disaster. Wintuk was awful fluff, Bananashpeel was so bad it closed almost immediately and I found Zarkana to be a total train wreck. First off, the show has some of the greatest sets and costumes I have ever seen out of a Cirque show. Before the show you are greeted by so many colorful characters that you hardly ever see again during the show and seem to have little to no reason for being them. Beautiful costumes parade around the theater making you think you are really in for something special and then they disappear never to be seen again. Going in, I really expected Zarkana to knock my socks off and it failed on pretty much every level. There were a few cool acts, but only that sand art one was totally original and none of the others were improvements on similar acts they had already done in other shows. Somewhat dull versions of acts that were knockouts in other productions. The worst part about it was the music. The female singer screeched and screamed the whole time. My husband left with a migraine and my father and I both had headaches. The music is all sung in English, which detracts from the performance. Lyrics made no sense and felt very convoluted. Often the screaming was so shrill you couldn't decipher the lyrics and because the were in English your brain automatically focuses on what they are trying to squeal instead of the overall picture on stage. The music itself fluctuated between totally dull and screamingly deafening. Rock opera fail! Early in the first act, a little girl got sucked into a machine. What happened was never fully explained and the only time this was revisited was for a hot second in the second act when a funeral procession crossed the stage screeching \"welcome to my funeral\". Totally unsatisfying. I am totally into dark and morbid. O and Quidam changed my life, but they felt like explorations, not exploitations. In addition, the story was supposed to be that of a magician looking for love. The male singer crooned like Elvis, never demonstrated any magic and it was totally unclear what his objective was. My father thought he was a magician depressed because he had no magic. My husband thought he was a ringleader who wanted to learn magic and I only knew he was a magician from the program and thought he was searching for the little girl who fell into the death contraption. Nothing was clear, despite the lyrics in our own language. In shows like Quidam, despite all the kooky characters and Cirqueish lyrics, you can always kinda tell who is who and what is going on and the music pulls you in and stays with you forever. I can't remember a single tune, just crooning and screeching. This show was full of loose ends. Only in the end when screechy lady descends from the ceiling dressed like a rosebush on steroids and they walk up the staircase singing at each other like something out of Phantom did it remotely look like he was searching for a pairing. So many special effects and so little substance. Special effects, though a form of artistry in itself are not the foundations of Cirque. Human talent and mind blowing creativity are and I can not be sold on flashy sets and ever changing screen projections if there is no substance or purpose behind them. I was there on the first preview, nobody knew when to clap, there was no standing ovation at the end and the audience looked mostly baffled while leaving. I would like to think it would drastically improve before official opening but unless they get an entirely new score, I can say this and Wintuk are the worst Cirque shows I have ever seen and certainly not worthy of NY. Where is Franco Dragone when you need him."

This one was an 'almost'.The sand artists and the white dressed dancer on the small circular stage, plus the light /shade effects were indeed amazing, the acrobats were great as ususal but there was no flow, the story seemed disconnected and 'pasted' on the show."

The performing acrobats and sand artist were wonderful, too bad they are in a terrible show. Music and singers made us want to run from the theater. No plot or flow to the show, never knew what was going on! There was one segment when a guy came out, knelt on a platform, there was a woman in the background behind the curtain, then out of no where, he stood up and left. The theater itself was very hot. Many people left at intermission and never came back. We assumed the show would be as wonderful as \"love\" was out in Vegas. Not so."

Having seen the show before, it was very disappointing that the costumer designer/outfitter of the rockettes seems to have decided on a \"modern\" approach on their costumes, rather than the \"Santarina\" outfits that they're advertised in since many years. Certain things should not be changed. They're called traditions and the colors and texture and look of the female Santa Outfit of the Rockettes would have to been included in that. The show was pretty much the same as a few years ago, but the ending was slightly lame. That certainly seemed bettter when I first saw it. Getting the tickets was easy & the operation of getting in, retail, F&B etc was smooth enough to be enjoyable. Still a good show, but would have hoped for the final appearance of the Rockettes at the end in the Santarina costumes -so the ending was a bit dull. Great to visit with kids."

We had front row seats, and I'd advise anyone looking to go that these were NOT ideal. Being so close to the stage meant that you couldn't really appreciate the precision dancing of the performers, nor could you get much impact from a fairly lengthy 3D sequence which happened near the beginning. I would guess that about half way back, near the middle would have been much better.As for the show, my wife loves Christmas, so she enjoyed it. It was a bit too \u201ccute\u201d for my taste, but lots of people seemed to be enjoying themselves. The Rockettes are clearly very good at their job, and I certainly appreciate the skill involved. I just found it a bit repetitive, and the dancing teddy bears doing ballet were a bit much for me. Still, I had an idea it was going to be a fairly sugary experience, so as long as you go in knowing that, and get better seats, you'll probably love it."

We turned up one very wet Sunday morning hoping they could squeeze us into the next show, which would be a welcome relief from the rain. We were very lucky that they could - although admittedly for the most expensive tickets! I would certainly advise anyone collecting tickets or even holding tickets to get there early. Many people left it very late and must have missed the first 20/30 mins of the show due to queues, which is a great waste of a ticket.The show is great fun, based around the traditional Christmas story and traditional Xmas characters. The singing and dancing from the Rockettes is brilliant. Lots of great costume changes and fabulous choreographed dances - my favourite being the toy soldiers.This is a great way to get anyone in the Christmas spirit. It's fabulous fun and extremely well put together."

Even though this year was an \"all new show\" it had many of the same basic elements so it didn't feel new, and in my mind that was a good thing. Good is good, regardless of when. I was filled with joy that they stil have live animals in the show, just like they did when I could not believe I was seeing a live Camel in NYC and it wasn't the zoo or circus! The first time I'd been there, I had orchestra seating which I do NOT recommend. Period. Much of the show is on the elevated stage so that was a lot of neck craning for the front and squinting from the rear. This time I had first mezzanine and loved it, Get center row, 1st Mezzanine tickets in the 1st-7th rows and you won't be disappointed. The Hall is lovely even 10 years after it's renovation so take the time to poke around a bit. The Hall staff were both accomodating and polite and I enjoyed it even more this time seeing the show as an adult than I did as a child. My 18 y/o loved it too, and next year I'm going to take my 7 and 5 year old children. If You're coming to NY and can only see one show, this is it. Oh- tip- you can book using AMEX rewards points through ticketmaster (if it's working....)- and if you do opt for will-call, regardless of what the site says have your CC AND your ID ready."

There is also a formal picture-taking area that charges. There are several merchandise areas and bars on each floor as well. The bar on the mezzanine level is in beauitful etched glass and I think it is the \"Rockettes\" bar.

Like most people except the Amercians, my wife and I had never heard of Radio City or the apparent \"world famous Rockettes\"!But we decided to book the Christmas Extravaganza show on a saturday night. Oh My God! What a fantastic show.Imagine a line of chorus girls in various states of christmas costumes with more Santas than you can shake a stick at,telling the story of Father Christmas through music and dance.Throw in an ice rink with skaters,Yes an ice rink on stage! The best special effects i have ever seen on a stage and you have the making of the greatest spectacular ever seen at christmas time.But that's not all, after all this the Nativity story is told in the traditional way. However there are exceptions, real animals are used, camels,sheep,donkeys,etc. Followed by the best Nativity story my wife and I have ever witnessed. Out of this world and very moving and the special effects invole in this,well see for yourself.If there is a show to be seen at christmas,see this one, we look forward to going again next year."

However I am so glad I had the opportunity to see the building and experience a Rockette's Show - I have no doubt the show is a wonderful event for families and children and is an annual event for many. For me - I found the show Disney like and I am not in that stage of life so I can't say the show wowed me. But again, the Radio City Music Hall is a must see."

What a suprise. If you haven't been to see a show you will be amazed by the building and the internal decorations, straight out of the 1920's!. My daughter wanted to meet a Rockette but unfortunately they weren't on that day but that was made clear to us before we started the tour. the tour guide was excellent answering all questions and adding inside information on how the theatre works. You get to see the stage mechanics and the rehearsal rooms. Well worth doing and good value."

The girl calling out for everyone to come and get their programs reminds you of another era. The show I saw, the Xmas Spectacular, was about a half hour too long for me, but I am glad I went. The restroom (ladies lounge) is in it's original state and is lovely. The views over the balconies are great. The rockettes are good too, but go just for the ambience! I purchased the least expensive tickets on the third level and I could see and hear just fine."

The Rockette's are wonderful and the entire show will be pleasing to all ages. This show is so good! It is great family entertainment!"

We actually went on November 20th and used an Entertainment coupon and saved tons of money and had orchestra seating. That was the last day that was considered not part of the \"peak season\". I would recommend Entertainment coupon books for any state you go to. You save so much money for attractions, food, etc. Back to the Radio City Christmas Spectacular show. A lot of time and effort goes into this show you know. The Rockettes were absolutely beautiful and did such a great job. This is a must see show! I recommend to all!"
