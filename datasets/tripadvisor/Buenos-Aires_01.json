            "review": "A wonderful visit to BA led by Marcelo. Firstly we have to apologise to Marcelo for the lateness in posting this review. We don't have any excuses apart from being busy. My partner and I spent three wonderful days with Marcelo in June and July. Prior to arriving in BA we gave Marcelo a rough idea in what we were interested in visiting - no to churches, yes to architecture, gardens, cafes.BA's weather wasn't kind to us on our first day but Marcelo planned around it as we taxied and wandered the wonderful neighbourhoods of BA. His encyclopaedic knowledge of the city that he loves, and Argentina in general, is amazing!! On the second day the weather cleared and we took full advantage by crisscrossing the city by taxi and public bus. We especially loved our visits to the historic cafes of BA. Our third day was on our return to BA after a trip to Peru that included walking the Inca Trail. To be honest we were exhausted and Marcelo tailored the day so that it was at a much more leisurely pace. We wanted to take Marcelo to lunch and asked for a recommendation of a 'locals' restaurant and Juana M. was perfect. A beautiful venue serving beautiful food staffed by excellent waiter staff. We can't recommend Marcelo enough. He showed us a BA we would never have seen on our own. Wonderful architecture, beautiful neighbourhoods, excellent cafes, frank and honest discussion about politics, economics and culture. We had never used a private guide before but after our amazing experience with Marcelo we can only hope our guides in the future are even half as good."

The private customized tour with Mr. Marcelo was the best city tour I ever have in my travel life as he tailor his tours according to customers interests. So, before we heads-up to our planned tour, he sat with us in the hotel lobby for 15 minutes to discuss and understand our points of interest and the areas that we had in our wish list so he can plan the day accordingly. The city tour was a combination of free walk, taxi and bus rides mainly to have blend feeling of Buenos Aires local transportation and get close to the hustle and bustle of the city. It was very successful and enjoyable full day tour with very professional guided tour. At the end of the trip, the guide provided us with an organized folder full of useful handy information about best restaurants, shopping and attractions in city so we can refer to it during our remaining days in the city.

His command of the history and sights of Buenos Aires was masterful. But equally important, he is a wonderfully delightful person who made the tour a thorough joy. I cannot recommend more highly."

Marcelo is not only an experienced tour guide, professional, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable, he is also a warm, easy going, friendly person we enjoyed spending time with. Marcelo speaks excellent English. Our communication was always efficient. We met at the hotel lobby always on time, and reviewed our itinerary every day before leaving the hotel. Marcelo always listened to our suggestions, and made sure to design the itinerary the way we could see the best of the city. He provided a folder with great suggestions on sightseeing, the restaurants, and the museums, and taught us basic Spanish words. We discussed Argentina history, architecture and politics, and we learned many interesting facts about the sites we visited. In the end of our daily tours we reviewed the sites we\u2019ve seen, and it was truly amazing how much we managed to see during these trips. Another great quality we would like to comment on, it\u2019s his flexibility. We were able to make last minute changes to our tours due the weather, and we also were able to personalize our tours according to our interests, and it worked out great! We absolutely recommend Marcelo tours while visiting Buenos Aires. Thank you very much for sharing your city with us!"

We were able to choose our own itinerary and he gave some great suggestions. After the tour he showed us on a map where we had been and marked a number of places on the we could visit on our own. He also provided us with a list of great restaurants and other useful information. He was quick to respond by email and later in our week when we had questions, he answered them for us. We would highly recommend Marcelo to anyone visiting Buenos Aires."

I was lucky enough to spend a day with Marcelo recently and had a fantastic time.We spoke briefly via e-mail before I arrived in BA and arranged to meet in my hotel lobby.Marcelo came with several suggestions on an itinerary for our time together and I chose one which included walking through most areas of the city.Marcelo spoke excellent English and was full of interesting facts about the sites we visited. There was never an awkward silence as we discussed politics, life in Argentina, history the list was endless.We had lunch in an excellent restaurant suggested by Marcelo where he provided me with lots of info on this to do and places to go during the rest of my stay.When I visit BA again I will absolutely be booking Marcelo again.Thank you for helping me make some excellent memories of BA."

            "review": "Jam packed two days with Marcelo!!. I only had two days to spend in this beautiful city, so it left little time for discovering the savory dishes offered here, or even the upscale shopping it is know for. Marcelo planned out two days of discovering many of the local neighborhoods, walking to enjoy the sights and sounds each area had to offer. My goal of discovering the joy of the Tango was satisfied with Marcelo's recommendations for evening performances that were outstanding. He arranged for my transportation to and from the airport that came off without a hitch. Marcelo is an intelligent, knowledgeable, and personable man with great pride in his home town and loves to show it off. Thank you Marcelo for sharing two wonderful whirlwind days in BA!!!"

We were lucky enough to spend the day with Marcello, being shown around his town.He helped us with our Spanish, discussed the local politics and history, and all while we walked and talked around BA.We came away with a better understanding of the city and its culture.Marcello also recommended some spots for us to visit later.A basement restaurant with really fresh salad vegetables was one of our favourites.The bookshop situated in a disused theatre was a must see.FInally, a delightful cafe on Ave de Mayo, for a wow moment.I haven't named these places because that is Marcello's business.No, this isn't an ad, we are just showing respect for Marcello's time and effort.Thanks again, Marcello"

            "review": "Marcelo is THE Best, Again!!. I was so happy that Marcelo was available last week when we visited Buenos Aires. I had told my friend how wonderful Marcelo was from my time with him 18 months ago. We started our first evening at the wonderful restaurant Oviedo to enjoy ourselves before our two full days of sightseeing with him. This trip I opted for a car and driver so we could make the most of our time. My friend fell in love with Marcelo from the start and was so impressed with his broad knowledge of Buenos Aires and Argentina. There was never a time we asked him a question from the arts to politics to the economy that he didn't have an answer. Amazing!! This was a very quick trip filled with great food and shopping! If we were looking for something in particular, Marcelo knew where to find it. I had been reading some books on 20th Century Argentina and had many questions about specifics and he gave me excellent answers to my questions. He laughed and at one point said he was very surprised I knew about that particular event. We had only one night free and asked about a local steakhouse that wasn't filled with tourists, he suggested one that was outstanding, The food was bountiful and delicious and not far from Recoleta. I cannot say enough great things about Marcelo. He is very funny also and can be a teaser as he did to me when were in the San Telmo antique area and told the driver to go slowly but not stop. He remembered my love of antiques and knew we would be on one street all afternoon. If you want the best, you have found the best!!"

Besides being a real professional, he is a very-very nice person as well. I've enjoyed every minute of the BA city tour which has been totally tailor-made based on my wishes and interests. He has plenty of opportunities to offer regarding the city tour and he speaks a beautiful English. He is a Porte\u00f1o, (meaning that he was born in Buenos Aires) and knows every little details of that wonderful city. It was a real pleasure to have him as my tour guide in Buenos Aires!

Unfortunately, he was going to be away when we planned our trip so he was not available to book our group. In our email correspondence, he did answer several of my questions about transport from the airport to our hotel. He offered to book a remis for us and then followed to send me the reservation number. We had a large group of people and true to his word, when we arrived at the airport, the remis company, TiendaLeon, had two vehicles ready to pick us up. If I get back to BA, I will definitely book Marcello as our tour guide."

He ensured there was a diversity of activities and really did a remarkable job of ensuring everyone had a great time.

The train ride itself was quiet an adventure. The tour includes a ferry ride on the river and a walk along the river for a lunch break. Marcelo is very knowledgeable and shared a lot of his own personal experiences with me.

Having Marcelo as our guide gave us a much better, more personalised and friendly orientation than using the hop-on, hop-off bus or wandering on our own. We opted for a half day tour after a long flight but he is happy to do a full day or longer and show you what BA has to offer. He also gave us fabulous information on dining options, sights, milonga and tango venues, bars, and markets. He took us to La Boca, San Telmo and Centro showing us just what we asked and along the way sharing history, politics, way of life, Spanish language lessons and more. A truly wonderful beginning to our first day in BA. Thank you so much Marcelo. Wendy and David, Australia"

My wife and I find that nothing beats walking different neighborhoods to discover the soul and atmosphere of a city.We found Marcelo not only to be very knowledgeable and flexible, but more importantly real fun to hang out with. It was like walking around Buenos Aires with a good friend. He is proud of and passionate about his city, and it shows. Our questions ended up becoming fun conversations and discussions, not only about the sights around us, but about history, politics and life in Buenos Aires in general. He also provided a wide range of more \"local\" suggestions for restaurants, shopping, things to do etc... In the nicest way possible, he will also try to steer you away from falling in certain tourist traps if you are so tempted. E.g. certain restaurants are known to give significant kickbacks to hotel concierges for references which you end up paying for. Together with Helena of Clandestino Music Travel, Marcelo gave us a real great taste of the city, that we want to go back and experience more of the city with him."

I strongly recommend hiring him shortly after arrival. He provided a packet of extremely useful but not overwhelming information and also gave me personalized suggestions on sights and restaurants that were consistently right on the mark. For example, he directed me to a old-style Argentine pizza place (El Cuartito) that was not only delicious but clearly a favorite of many--there was a line of locals waiting before it opened for lunch. His tours were very enjoyable. I was happy to walk for the most part but you should be prepared to cover any taxis (utterly cheap in BA) or entrance fees as they are not included in his fees. I should also add that he was helpful before the trip in booking a remis from the airport. A class act and a guide with ten years experience that I am happy to recommend very highly."

He had terrific info on local shops, restaurants and specialties to order.We would love to come back and have Marcelo help us with a longer stay.He is very prompt with emails and sharing information. He is kind to all of us and also to strangers on the street. He gave us so much information about BA. He accomodated a couples tour within a bigger group of older travellers, about to go on a cruise.We had a nice blend of walking and use of a van to cover lots of ground.THank you Marcelo."

Once arriving in his city he met us on time, every time, for the four days he was with us. Before we left on our first tour he sat down with us and laid out our four days, which we could have altered if we wanted to, but we never did because his plans were just perfect! Our first couple days we walked, which gave us a great opportunity to get to know each other and to get a real feel for the neighborhoods. On the remaining days we realized we were a bit old and tired, and very simply switched over to taxis, very inexpensive taxis, and finished our tour that way. Marcelo himself was more than we could have hoped for... so knowledgeable, so fun, and had the three of us in good moods all day long. He also arranged all of our travel to the port and the airport even after our tour was sadly over. Thanks to Marcelo we will always remember Buenos Aires as a wonderful city and will miss it, but just as importantly we will remember him and miss him."

We couldn't have been happier with the experience. Marcello was very good with pre-trip communications. We worked out details for a vehicle rental in advance and everything was very clearly communicated. He even answered several questions we had about transportation from the airport to our hotel and questions we had about currency. He was very helpful on the tour when one of us needed language help at a pharmacy. The tour included some local spots that we would not have found on our own. The pizza and empanadas at lunch were amazing and we had a stop at a local bar that was also fun. We found Marcello very flexible and he accommodated our requests to modify the basic tour because we were already planning to see certain things on another day. Highly recommended!"

We had to hire a limo at additional expense to get us around the city which is quite large. This needs to be addressed up front and I would suspect that many of his clients fall into this category. That aside he does a wonderful job of bringing Buenos Aires alive and is full of history and vignettes about it. His performance was a worthy addition to the tour of this city which is a wonderful place to visit."

My wife and I were on an extended vacation which began in Cape Town and wound up with us disembarking the Oceania Marina in Buenos Aires on 22 December 2015. I had been planning this trip for a long time and had the good fortune of selecting Marcelo to be our guide while we were in Buenos Aires. He was one of several guides I contacted in planning the trip but his communication was outstanding and his commitment to fulfilling our requirements was obvious. He not only conducted our tours but he also booked our transportation from the port to our apartment in Palermo and from our apartment to EZE airport for our return flight to the U.S. which is tomorrow. He did not ask for extra compensation for these services and he in fact reconfirmed the transportation the day before it was scheduled. This was not small task because we took 4 day trips to Mendoza and to Iguazu Falls requiring transportation to the local airport for both trips.When we travel, we try to not just see a city or an area but to understand it. Marcelo is the guy that can do that for you in Buenos Aires. He earned his 4 year college degree in tourism but more than that he knows and understands Buenos Aires past and present. If you tour with Marcelo it won't be a drive around \"on the left you can see a (fill in the blank}\" kind of tour. it will be a feet on the street walk around through neighborhoods and historic sites with a full explanation about how and why those neighborhood came to be and the significance past and present of historic sites. If you listen, you will know Buenos Aires when you are through.We had the luxury of touring with Marcelo for two full days and two half days. In that time we visited (I will likely forget some fascinating place and for that i apologize) Recoleta and the world famous Recoleta Cemetery, Retiro, Palermo, San Telmo, La Boca, Puerto Madero, and Tigre. We came away understanding the significance and differences in those areas. We came away better understanding how Buenos Aires evolved and what it is today. Because of the distance involved to reach some of these locations we had the opportunity to take taxis, a train, a bus, and a sight seeing boat. What a thrill.Since so much walking was involved on some of these days, Marcelo was always checking to make sure we were okay, if we needed to stop for a coffee, drink, or snack, and to make sure we didn't over extend ourselves. He always explained the distances we had to go and gave us the opportunity to take a taxi if we preferred. We usually didn't. There is so much more to see when you walk the neighborhoods. We felt connected to the city that way. We have rarely had a tour guide that was so aware of our needs as individuals. I have gotten a little sappy but that is because we thoroughly enjoyed our time with Marcelo and appreciate what we learned from him. For that, we have Marcelo to thank. Muchas gracias Marcelo! Muchas gracias!"

After reading all his great remarks here at TA you might wonder if someone like Marcelo exists. And yes, he does and very much so. Prompt replies beforehand when making our booking as well as adjustments to our interests. We had a full day of excursion in the city with occasional transfers by taxi to different areas of the town. As mentioned in other reviews he has a university degree in Tourism, knows and can pedagogically communicate Argentinian history and historic events in fluent English. On top of that, we were informed about current political and social developments and we had several interesting discussions on those topics too. And to add another thing, we had great fun also - something which is important if you are supposed to spend a whole day together. To summarise - a Marcelo full day tour is a perfect introduction to Buenos Aires! And if you don't take it, you won't get his personal and \"secret\" key addresses for genuine and great restaurants (we know since we tried them)! Thanks Marcelo!"

When it was too rainy and cold to continue one of our daytime tours, he rearranged his schedule so that we could make up the time on the following day, when the sun was shining. He joined us two times for dinner, both of which he arranged for at popular restaurants, one in a renovated warehouse (with an art gallery motif) in the Retiro District, the other in Puerto Madero, along the waterfront in the city's largest redevelopment project. He also led us to several local cafes, where he introduced us to different types of coffee and local favorite treats.

He was so personable and flexible in regard to changing the agenda where applicable. I would highly recommend Marcello for any future Buenos Aires tour needs."

We toured with him for an entire day and saw a great deal of the city on foot and with brief cab rides. His English is excellent and his knowledge of the city, it's history, the political and financial climate is very wide-ranging. Marcelo improved our understanding of the city and the country, not just locations and isolated facts about the things we saw, but the feelings, attitudes, and concerns of the people who live there. He is a native Porteno with a university degree in Tourism. He came to our hotel, met with us, and established a personalized tour based on our input. My wife and I spoke of the things we learned from him for the rest of our trip! Highly recommended!!"

So much so that I look forward to reconnecting with him the next time I am in Argentina!"

We connected with Marcelo based on the recommendation of my sister. My wife, I, and our daughter, bonded with him almost immediately. His English is excellent. He's a master at figuring out what you're looking for and then creating a tour that fits your tastes, time, and budget. He considers it part of his service to help you with any pending logistics. For us, this was helping with the purchase of tickets to Colonia. We walked the City and his explanations of history, politics, and culture (tango anyone?) were great. His restaurant recommendations were outstanding. An Argentine submarine is not something you should miss. I've used guides in Spain, Israel, and other countries. I highly recommend Marcelo as someone who will make your trip fun and memorable."

This was the end of a Argentina trip that included a celebration in Las Termas and a short visit to Cordoba.

Marcelo managed to make each day a treat for all of us. He met us and took into consideration what we were interested in doing. His knowledge of history and current events was amazing and extremely interesting and an enhancement to our visit. He went even beyond just being our guide. He booked our car service, suggested restaurants, scheduled a tour of the Opera, and even managed to retrieve my phone left behind. Thank you Marcelo!!"

Safety was a big concern to Marcelo (taxis, areas, do not exchange money on the street, it can be counterfeit). He gave us a list of eateries (types of food, quality), clubs, museums. Then Marcelo took us to several areas (mausoleum cemetery, church and down town area). Marcelo's discussions on the history and explanation of the culture truly helped us get a better understanding of what we were seeing and experiencing. Highly recommend his services."

I have traveled extensively and have used many private guides and I can honestly say Marcelo Alejandro Mansilla was one of the best guides I have ever used.I had read reviews of the top rated guides and reached out to several of them. From the start he excelled. Marcelo responded promptly, his emails were clear and concise and he suggested itineraries based on our interests. Due to availability we were able to secure Marcelo for two days and used two other guides on other days. Marcelo exceeded our expectations all around. He is prompt, personable, speaks excellent English and has a wealth of knowledge of BA and its history and politics. He gave us an extensive map of the city as well as his personal recommendations of things to do and places to eat. He was flexible and adjusted the tour to our interests. The best part of it was that it was ENJOYABLE. We spent a lot of time with him and it was like seeing the city with a friend. In my opinion, he was far superior to our other private guides on this trip. Ironically, he was the one guide who didn\u2019t ask us to give a five star TA review or none at all. This seems to be a growing trend not only in BA but other in other parts of the world as well. I was under the impression that TA was a forum for travelers to help fellow travelers not free advertising for vendors!"

I didn't do much planning but i did find reviews on Marcelo. i couldn't find any of my friends to go so went by myself. I didn't know the city but hired Marcelo for 2 full days and he helped so much for me getting to know the city. Here are the main reasons I such a good experience1. Marcelo came to my place the first meeting and sat down with me to discuss the goals of my trip. Then he came up with ideas and let me choose from them. We planned both days then;2. I'm a CPA and am always early to things and irritated if people don't show on time. Marcelo was always prompt;3.I'm a light hearted guy and enjoy tourist things but also enjoy joking around with people. I let Marcelo know that, especially as I can only absorb so much history in one day. We had great conversations, coffee breaks, lunch breaks but he was always considerate in asking if that's what i wanted. I enjoyed sitting and having coffee and discussing fun and interesting subjects about our lives and just joking around about things; 4. Despite hanging out with a great guy, he's very professional and very knowledgeable about the sites and history. I learned ton of interesting things that I would never have learned about on say a bus tour;5.Marcelo would tell me some of the sites i might want to visit on my free days; 6. I had multiple questions that i emailed him about, even after my tours and he always promptly replied with great advise. He even answered questions before my trip and recommend an agency that games tourists to futbol games;7. He made me feel safe. I needed to change money and knew about the Blue Dollar rate. I asked him and he took me to a safe place that the locals use to exchange money at good rates. I can't say enough about my positive experience and would recommend him to anyone."

I already knew his written English was impeccable so I was not surprised to hear his absolutely perfect, spoken English. His enthusiasm and love for his city was evident immediately and his knowledge of its history was inspiring. Our tour included parts of Retiro and Recoleta and it was full of facts and insight delivered with an obvious joy and passion. In Marcelo's capable hands the history of Buenos Aires came alive.I usually don't hire a guide when I travel but I recommend, unequivocally, hiring Marcelo for all the reasons, stated above, and also because the city is vast and full of wonders and you'll need help deciding what to see. I have 2 regrets, the first is not hiring Marcelo for a full day instead of the 4 hours that we chose and second, after returning from hiking in Patagonia we waited too long in contacting Marcelo for a second tour, not surprising, he was already booked. Book as soon as you have finalized plans to visit and believe me after touring with Marcelo you will run to Trip Advisor to add your own \"Excellent\" rating."

He went above and beyond for me including calling a remis... actually he called two companies when the first ones price seemed high, and indeed got my cost reduced by 30%. Then offered to discuss the cost of the trip with the driver to ensure there were no problems with \"add ons\" such as toll fees (I speak very little Spanish). I can't recommend him highly enough. He provides you with an extensive map of the city and a complete list with several restaurants, bars, discos, tango clubs, museums and shops that he recommends in BA. I was in BA 11-19-14."

First day in BA was with Marcelo and he provided all the info one could need for a great adventure in a city we knew nothing about. After a great tour, he reviewed our itinerary and made a number of suggestions and restaurant recommendations - most of which we followed and were very happy with. I highly recommend Marcelo for English speaking, first timers in BA."

My husband and I (30's from NYC) were debating between Marcelo and another top rated private tour guide, and ultimately chose Marcelo: His responsiveness was super quick, thorough, and clear. Even after our tour was over, Marcelo continued to be available to answer various questions we had throughout our stay in Argentina. What a great choice we made choosing Marcelo! We spent the entire day from 10am - 5pm with Marcelo and saw the entire city. He helped us exchange money in the morning and subsequently took us to all the main attractions. He knew of the best cafes to stop in for lunch, and the places where (nice) restrooms were easily available - very important when you're out for the entire day! There was never a dull moment in conversation... I only wish we had more time together. Overall, do not hesitate to book with Marcelo... the tour was absolutely worth every single penny!"

Buenos Aires is a very difficult city to navigate if you don't speak Spanish and Marcelo's excellent English, his knowledge and love of Buenos Aires, and flexibility make it so worth the time and money. He tailors the tour to exactly what you want to see--culture, history, shopping, restaurants whatever. He is fun, easy to get a long with and someone you just would want to hang out with...Highly recommend. We learned more about Buenos Aires than our friend who is a native!"

This turned out to be one of the smartest things we could have did. Not only did he teach us a ton about the history, architecture and other details of the city and people of Buenos Aires. But he got us very acclimated to the various areas of the city which helped us throughout the remainder of our trip. He also gave me some helpful hints on exchanging money and provided us with a nice map and numerous recommendations on places to eat and drink. We were fortunate enough to try a lot of them and nothing disappointed us.Not only do I feel like we found an excellent tour guide to share with any of our friends fortunate enough to visit his great city but we have a new friend in Buenos Aires that we look forward to visiting again with in the future. Thanks for a great full day tour!!!!!!"

Please do believe he is a treasure-engaging, fun, knowledgeable, trustworthy, humorous, friendly, organized, meticulous etc. His dedication to providing excellent service is unrivaled. Marcelo has an open, inquisitive mind so he is constantly learning and evolving which trickles down to his tours. As he said to me \" I like to travel in time\". Our story: My husband and I have never hired a private guide before, preferring to do it all on our own after our research, but felt the need for help for our first South America trip. Since TA has never let us down I contacted Marcelo. I came up with a plan for the 2 full days we spent with him; he perfected it. I could feel how dedicated he was through the many emails we generated. We loved our experience with him, not expecting to be as comfortable touring with him as we were. My husband ( CPA) was particularly impressed with the depth of his economic knowledge, saying that Marcelo knew some minutiae he didn't think his colleagues did. Before leaving him on the 2nd day he said to feel free to contact him with any questions or issues. Now returned home and thinking of our time in Buenos Aires we have more thoughts and questions, so Marcelo's tutelage continues long distance as we took him up on his offer. He is a teacher, a friend, and a ( well behaved) little brother all in one!"

He had some really helpful advice regarding exchanging dollars to pesos at a favorable exchange rate. He showed up on time at our hotel on the appointed day and took the time to ask us about our interests and what we'd like to do before we got started. We had a great tour of the San Telmo market on a Sunday and also some of the more central tourist locations near the Obelisk and in Microcentro. The next day he gave us a tour of the Recoleta cemetery, which was one of the highlights - there is no need to struggle to find Evita's mausoleum, Marcelo knows exactly where it is. He speaks excellent English and is very open to answering questions about Argentina's current state as well as its history - he really brought a valuable new dimension to our time in BA, and we thoroughly enjoyed his company.

We booked a full day tour with him and at no point did it ever feel like things were dragging along.

Marcelo is, in a word, phenomenal.From the very first, Marcelo proved himself to be consummately professional yet also warm and engaging. I sent him an email a few weeks before traveling to Buenos Aires and his reply was prompt and informative describing his philosophy and approach to guiding visitors through his city. Specifically, he met up with my partner and me at our hotel in the morning and, rather than having a set plan of what to show us, he talked with us to determine what our particular interests were and how best to tailor our day to emphasize them. As a result, Marcelo was able to strike just the right balance of showing and explaining historical sites and the events surrounding them, highlighting the culture and cuisine of \"real\" porte\u00f1os, and making us feel as though we were sharing all of this with a new friend. Indeed, Marcelo is armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of the city's history and culture from end to end and therefore is completely versatile in his ability to tailor the day to exactly what, when, and where his guests want to see and do.Marcelo offers both half-day and full-day tours; we opted for the latter and were very glad that we did. No maps or tour books (or, for that matter, large-group tour guides) ever could have allowed for the personalized, interesting, and most importantly, fun experience of Buenos Aires that Marcelo afforded us. For instance, it would be fairly useless for us as newcomers to wander through Recoleta Cemetery or the Plaza de Mayo without Marcelo's spot-on explanations of the history and iconography of these important and complex sites. Not only did he stick to a script, though; it seemed that whether it was some random mausoleum I pointed out in the cemetery or a heraldic element of the Argentine coat of arms, he knew the ful story behind it. Needless to say, his English is perfect but nevertheless was, thankfully, very patient with my attempts at practicing Spanish! Marcelo's passion for his hometown is infectious; through spending the day with him, my partner and I were able to get into just the right mindset to best enjoy the city. In order that we could continue to get the most out of our visit even after parting ways, he provides his guests with an annotated guide of his own writing to the city's best eateries, attractions, etc. that proved very useful to us throughout the rest of our stay. In sum, I cannot recommend Marcelo enough, but certainly can warn that you would be missing out tremendously not to get the chance to see Buenos Aires through his eyes."

So as to maximise our time we had, we asked Marcelo for a half day afternoon guide tour as well as the following day, and we are so glad we did. Nothing was too much of an issue for Marcelo, so much so that he wanted to collect us from our B&B that afternoon and arrived right on time. He asked could we sit with him before we do anything so he could get a feel for what we were after and wanted to see. This was 30 minutes well spent, as from this sit down, he drafted a plan for that afternoon and the following day. Off we went and no sooner out the door, our lessons to get comfortable with BA began, i.e. how to catch a taxi, where to stand, what gesture to use, and which type of taxi, and how to pay. We needed to change money and Marcelo helped us with that as well.From there we began walking and he began talking, and we learnt so much in just those few hours. I won\u2019t go into where we went or what we did, as that\u2019s for you to find out and draft your plan yourself. When he left us that afternoon (6pm is afternoon in BA) in the heart of town, he pointed to a couple cafes where we could go for our afternoon snack, where to catch our taxi back home, and said he would see us the next morning. He also suggested a great meeting spot since we were now confident to catch a taxi. So we left Marcelo, grabbed a coffee, looked at our photos from that afternoon, and discussed between us what we had just done and learnt about Argentina the city, the people and the history of it all.Next day we arrived in the centre of the city and met Marcelo who took us to a famous caf\u00e9 for coffee and more learning. We spent time over coffee with a map that Marcelo provided and said it was ours to keep, and he explained where we had been yesterday, and what he had planned for today, and at the same time marked up places for us to visit by ourselves over the next couple of days.Off we went exploring, and the stories from Marcelo continued, and the pieces were all coming together; we felt like we were in our own modern day screenplay and the story was coming to alive as we visited buildings, statues, gardens, parks, and suburbs of BA. We took lunch where the real people of BA have lunch\u2026not some fancy tourist style restaurant, but an exciting vibrant caf\u00e9. That afternoon we rode the public bus and learnt how to do so for future travelling. We also learnt how to take the subway, all the time keeping familiarised to our map. Often Marcelo would test us and ask where do we think we are now! It\u2019s what I call learning as you go. We walked past iconic tourist attractions, where he would say you can visit these yourselves and when was the best time to avoid crowds etc.So when it came to the end of our tour that afternoon, Marcelo\u2019s story he had been sharing with us from 1pm the previous day had all come together. We now understood why BA is the way it is today. We had been taken on a journey of discovery from way back in the 1800s, through the wars, the revolutions, and into modern day BA. I could go on about it, but I will leave that for you all to discover yourselves.So re Marcelo, this was now our 4th private guide for South America and clearly the best yet. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the others were good, but Marcelo\u2019s unique way of showcasing BA and all it has to offer was so different to what we had before. Not only did we learn about Argentina, but we now were confident to tackle the remainder ourselves using public transport, and how to spot the good from the bad.He also provided a comprehensive list and details of all sorts of things we could do whilst in BA - he was the only guide we've had that has provided this type of thing!If I could sum up Marcelo, it was like having your own personal concierge who knows the place only too well, where to shop, where to eat, where to get the best exchange rates, and when to go, and at what time to get the best value. But his service didn\u2019t stop with us when we left him that afternoon as he offered via email if we needed some assistance for the remaining time we were there. We took him up on that and can proudly say that he found us what we were looking for.I'm sure you can gather from my review that we loved Marcelo, and we wish him all great things in the future because he deserves it. He's simply the best!"

Knowledge of all the historical spots; someone to help you cut through all the mass tourist scene to get to places really worth seeing? Perhaps you want someone to give you an insiders interpretation of culture, economic and political factors or maybe you just want pleasant company while you see the sights.You can have all of this and so much more with Marcelo. I have yet to encounter his equal anywhere else. If there was an award for international tour guide of the year he would be a top contender for it, no question.Marcelo is a prompt, efficient, very intelligent and cultured young man who knows his city backwards and wants to help you explore and understand it. You can trust him 110% and his advice is always right on the money. Oh and his English is excellent.I could go on but then I would only be repeating all of the other positive reviews already here.I will however close with this - every time I go to BA I always contact Marcelo and a visit to this city would not be the same without him.It's as simple as this: going to BA and really want to understand the place, then call Marcelo. You will be glad you did and your visit will be all the more memorable for his contribution."

It's a walking tour with some cab rides but we were extremely exhausted after every half day as we covered a lot and the temperature was 100F, Although you can see Buenos Aires on your own, I recommend a private guide. It is more enjoyable and if you have two people, the price isn't so much different than doing a tour. Marcelo covered the main attractions and told us very interesting facts about the history and culture of Argentinians. At the end of the tour, he gave us a binder of great recommendations for restaurants and clubs. We tried 3-4 and the recommendations were spot on! Marcelo also told us how to/where to exchange currency at the unofficial blue rate, which made our USD get us 50% more... Overall, highly recommended and worth every penny. He was fun too :)) We had a great day"

He was always very responsive and informative during the booking process. At our request, he also gave us recommendations of some hotels and things to do during the days he could not be with us since he was already booked.The first day we met in BA, he arrived at the hotel on time and before leaving for the tour we sat down for a few minutes to discuss about the itinerary and to get to know better about our interests. He also gave us a lot of additional information about restaurants, attractions, and etc for the days we would be by ourselves.Marcelo was very easy going, knowledgeable and kept things interesting by giving enough information without making it boring. He is also very flexible in terms of transportation - if you like to walk like we do he will walk with you all day long, but if you prefer taxis, bus, subway, etc, he will also do whatever he can to accommodate.If we ever go back to BA, I will certainly get in touch with Marcelo again. The money was very well spent, specially when compared to other companies/guides I also quoted."

Given our limited time, we wanted to see and learn as much about the city as possible, and this was completely achievable via our time with Marcelo. Even prior to arriving in BA, Marcelo was responsive in his e-mails. He gave plenty of suggestions, answered our hundreds of questions, and really tried to get to know our needs and desires as tourists in his city. He was perfectly candid and honest (which I really liked) in letting us know which neighbourhoods he would help us to understand better historically/culturally-wise, and areas we would be fine exploring on our own (i.e. Puerto Madero, San Telmo), and his fees were completely fair. In one day, he took us to Recoleta, Downtown, La Boca/Caminito, rounding off with the beautiful neighbouhood of Retiro. Among the highlights, we visited the absolutely stunning Recoleta cemetary, the quaint and colourful houses of La Boca, and pretty much all of the city's major historical and political monuments. He showed us that BA really is beautiful city to walk around in, and in one instance of the day, he showed us how to ride the bus like a 'porteno'. Marcelo was extremely knowledgeable in presenting the chronological evolution of BA and how multi-culturally influenced the city really is. We could see from his enthuasiasm how passionate he is about this city. I also loved that he would ask us frequently what we think something represents to keep us engaged (and it was a hot day too!), and constantly tried to help us learn useful spanish words (or different intonations). He was so calm, friendly and unassuming that it was like reuniting with a really good friend. He also took us to a really great restaurant downtown (La Junta) for lunch that wasn't a tourist spot at all. There, we realized that empanadas and pizza really go hand in hand (peas in pod) given BA's italian and spanish influences. Finally, he gave us a bunch of material with restaurant, bar, and milonga recommendations that we could refer to after our time with him. We ended up leveraging two recommendations (Sarkis - restaurant, and Salon Canning - Milonga) and both were absolutely wonderful! BA is a beautiful place, but is only done right with the help and guidance of Marcelo! We would definitely recommend him to all of our friends and family to go with him if they visit Argentina!"

We started our trip off with 1.5 days in Buenos Aires, down to Patagonia, then ended it with 4 full days back in Buenos Aires. I had no idea how to do certain things in the city and frankly, just wanted a local to help me out and show us around.Heard great things about Marcelo, and they weren't wrong! I really wanted to know about where to change money, how to get around the city, and some highlights and history. 4 hours is just not enough time, but we packed in everything I wanted and more. Marcelo met us at our hotel, then we began walking. It was great learning more about the Argentines and people of the city, and swapping knowledge about our 2 countries. At the end of the tour, Marcelo gave my husband and me a folder full of information - places to eat, shop, etc, that we used extensively on our 4 day stay in the city. Excellent recommendations!As for Marcelo himself, he's an enterprising business owner who obviously enjoys what he's doing. He was helpful, humorous, and easy to talk to. It was a nice easy tour, never feeling rushed, and when we wanted a snack, he showed us the best place for ice cream. It was a great thing for me to hand the reins off for a few hours to someone so friendly and capable. If you're going to spend any amount of time in BA, it's a must to hire Marcelo!"

If you want to see the real Buenos Aires through the eyes of local, with a passion for his hometown, then don't waste your time or money with any other tours. Marcelo will meet you for a wonderful walking tour that highlights all the things Buenos Aires has to offer. Our group of 3 learned more about the architecture, history, politics and food of this wonderful city than we could have ever discovered through any purchased travel guide or preplanned tour. Even TripAdvisor did provide as much interesting and amazing information. The passion Marcelo provided when describing everything from the founders of Argentina to the opera house was infectious and made me want to spend even more time in this city. The additional information he provided when our tour was over was used extensively and I feel it helped us organize our trip to the fullest. Marcelo directed us to some of the best meals of our trip. If you are lucky enough to have a meal with him, just follow his lead and order what he does. When I get back to BA someday, I will certainly plan to spend some additional time with Marcelo. I know there is so much more to learn."

He came recommended to us by another friend who had used his tour guide services a while back. He responded very quickly to our initial contact, and provided invaluable information as we prepared for the trip. He invited us to ask any questions we might have in advance, and again he was very prompt in responding. There is no reason to repeat all the favorable comments that other reviews have outlined in detail. We first met up with him the afternoon of our arrival, and after learning about our individual interests and giving us a brief overview of what he had planned for our first half-day together, off we went. Fortunately, what he had planned for that half-day ran out as our energy did, and we finalized plans to meet up again the next morning for a full day of touring other parts of the city. By the time we were done, between what he showed us, talked about, and advised us about in the written materials he provided, we had absolutely everything we needed to make our trip a great success. Throughout our time with him, he was careful to adjust the pace to make sure we didn't dally, but didn't overextend either. He was very strategic in his use of our time, making sure that we got the maximum benefit from our time with him; even when we needed to stop for lunch or coffee, he used that time to pack in more information that would help us later. Although there were four of us traveling together, he kept us together and was careful to make sure that he spent time talking to each of us. When we parted at the end of the second day, it felt far more like saying farewell to a friend rather than only the end of a tour. Our day-and-a-half was a functional amount of time and, thanks to his advice, we were able to fully enjoy the remainder of our week in Buenos Aires. That said, there were many moments when we wished we still had him along with us--not so much because we felt we needed him, but just because he is who he is. Our bottom line recommendation: hire this delightful, knowledgeable, and talented young man for as much of your stay as you can afford--you won't regret it!"

For our May 2013 trip to Buenos Aires, however, we thought we'd try something different and decided to hire a private tour guide for a few days. After much research, we chose Marcelo based on his incredible TripAdvisor reviews. We also figured that if we're going to try the private-tour-guide option, we might as well do it big. So several months in advance of our trip, we booked Marcelo for four and a half days out of our nine days in Buenos Aires.After receiving the first email from Marcelo, we knew we had found a gem. Every communication from him was helpful, cheerful, and professional. Even though our trip was still months in the future, Marcelo enthusiastically and promptly answered every email we sent him containing various questions about travel to Argentina. By the time our trip had arrived, we were already thinking of Marcelo as our new Argentine buddy, based on our many friendly email exchanges.On our first scheduled day, Marcelo arrived at our rental apartment in Recoleta promptly on time. As we began our first day with him, we soon understood that all of his glowing reviews on TripAdvisor were 100% accurate. Marcelo doesn't just lead you along some route he's predetermined and then regurgitate a bunch of memorized talking points along the way; instead, he helps you figure out where/how you want to explore the city that day and then he joins you in that exploration as an enthusiastic participant, deftly guiding you generally, but otherwise letting you set the pace and tone of the journey. All subsequent days were the same: Marcelo was right on time, in good spirits, and led us on a fantastic tour of the city. Marcelo's knowledge of Buenos Aires and Argentina is extensive, personal, and intellectual. He doesn't just tell you a bunch of facts and figures about what you're seeing. Instead, he wants you to understand what you're seeing within the cultural, political, and historical context of the city, region, country, and continent. Marcelo tells the story of what you're seeing in a concise, yet deeper and richer way than any guidebook or corporate tour ever could. Marcelo is passionate about his city and country, and it's infectious. Marcelo is also one of those rare people that, five minutes after you've met him for the first time, you feel like you've known him for years and that you're hanging out with your best friend. To conclude, we can only echo what all of the previous TA reviewers have said about Marcelo: he's knowledgeable, helpful, prompt, professional, interesting, trustworthy, and charming. Marcelo is not just the best personal tour guide in Buenos Aires; he's also an exceptional human being. Our only regrets are: 1.) we didn't hire him for a few more days and, 2.) we couldn't bring him home with us!"

We saw many of the city's main attractions, and Marcelo tied into his tour many anecdotes and historical insights that brought BA to life. My only complaint about him is that, despite his denials, he underestimates what he is worth. Book him quickly. Do not let him escape!"

We met with Marcelo, at our hotel ahead of the tour, where we explained our interests and objectives for the day. He then detailed where he planned to take us and provided a verbal itinerary... we agreed and set off on foot.The tour Marcelo provided was fantastic! He showed us spots in BA we would never have found on our own and provided fascinating insights into each hi-lite. His knowledge of Argentinian history, politics and society are next to none. His commentary, english and tour pace were excellent! At the end of his tour day he provided great tips on other sightseeing and activity we could do on our own while in BA. We followed his advice and had an amazing 2 days afterwards... thanks Marcelo!We are avid world travelers from Canada and by far this tour ranks among the best we have ever taken anywhere in the world. I was sorry the tour had to end and we could not have continued traveling with Marcelo. Marcelo is a master at his job and we highly recommend him for your touring needs in BA."

It is a walking-taxis-bus tour covering the city. Marcelo provides private tours based on your choices and his recommendations of what to see in the time-frame and pace you set. He was most accommodating with every aspect from planning to providing wonderful suggestions for dining and entertainment. In addition to his in-depth knowledge of the city and history, he has a most enjoyable personality and a wonderful sense-of-humor. It was like touring with your best friend taking care of everything! The tour was informative, relaxed, interactive and just a wonderful time spent in BA. I can't wait to return soon! I highly recommend Marcelo!"

Spending time with him in BA was the best decision. Not only did I truly enjoy his company, but I learned so much about Buenos Aires and Argentina.He takes pride in providing his guide services and enjoys telling the fascinating history and background of each area. I was so happy to have him there to teach me, rather than me trying to read it all from a travel book, or be on group tour. He makes the day fun and interesting and will pace his guide services to whatever you prefer. I told him that I wanted to see it all...and we walked, took taxis, and the subway, and after three long and wonderful days, we accomplished all that I wanted to see! He never tires and is always charming and in a good mood- no matter the heat, the length of day, or any of my requests. As he has traveled a lot, he understands other cultures and he speaks perfect English. Every moment I spent with him was an absolute delight. I truly consider him a friend."

Traveling with Marcelo was like spending time with a good friend. He truly cared about us, which made this a much more pleasant experience than we have ever had (or expected) with your typical tour guide.Marcelo was recommended to me by my travel agent, who raved about his tours at an affordable price (quality and affordability are very important to me). He thought my family and I would have a more enjoyable experience in Buenos Aires with Marcelo\u2019s assistance, and was he ever right.From his first email to our good-bye after 2 days together, I found Marcelo to be professional, personable and extremely customer-focused, with a great sense of humor. He doesn\u2019t have a canned tour. Fluent in English, Marcelo customized each of our days to accommodate two 40+ adults and a 78-year old senior citizen (three people who don\u2019t speak the language, brought a variety of interests, personalities and never-ending questions). He was totally flexible and unflappable. Marcelo is quite knowledgeable of Argentinean history, and current events both in Buenos Aires and the US. Well-traveled himself, he has interesting and well-thought out perspectives of culture, politics and people in general. I wish we had more time with Marcelo, but after 2 days, we had a firm grounding on Buenos Aires, and knew exactly what we wanted to do in our remaining few days. He set us up for success!I see another trip to Buenos Aires in our future. With Marcelo\u2019s wonderful assistance, I look forward to exploring locations outside of the city. I know that he\u2019ll always make the adventures interesting, fun and memorable.Sharon Lewis"

Some guides just go through the motions, having done the same tour a thousand times. Not Marcelo. Within a short time of meeting Marcelo, we felt like we had a friend showing us around town. We spent two days with Marcelo. We learned far more about Argentina and the city, politics, culture, economics, you name it, than just the various sites we went to. And of course, we got a great tour of the city too. Even a few unusual finds that others I have spoken to have never seen. I highly recommend spending two days. We were able to do things at a leisurely pace, take some breaks and spend time at cafes and other places with Marcelo and, as I said, felt like we were with a friend enjoying the city. Marcelo was also very very helpful even before we arrived in Buenos Aries, giving us information and tips. And when we finished up with him he gave us a package with a map and various recommendations for places to eat and other things to do. Also, I felt his fee was very reasonable, in comparison to what i have spent in other cities around the world for a private guide (no transportation. you walk or take taxi's with him)"

He responded promptly; his initial message was very helpful, and he adjusted the tour schedule to fit the time that we had available (about 5.5 hours). Marcelo was very accommodating with respect to our needs (washrooms, food, drink etc.) as he toured us to the important historical, political and social sites within Buenos Aires, as well as (at our request) shops where we could find some souvenirs of our trip. He blended the site visits with an engaging commentary on the social, political and economic fabric of the country. Marcelo is well-spoken and informative, with a clear passion for Argentina, Buenos Aires and Portenos \u2013 of which he is one. I would not hesitate to use his services again or recommend him to friends and colleagues. Simply great!"

We visited a street fair in San Telmo and stopped in a little coffee shop, a favorite of Marcelo's ( and, again decades old).

He allowed us time to do what we wanted to see, in our case the wonderful Museo Fortabat, but he gently suggested (correctly) that we would be far better off spending some time with him in Retiro instead of La Boca.Marcelo has also compiled his own recommended list of restaurants, clubs & attractions which he gave us in order for us to do our exploring on our own.On our last night in BA we visited an iconic Milonga, La Confiteria Ideal, (at the top of his list) & spent over 3 hours mesmerized by the Tango dancers, both amateur and expert, and inspired by the sensual and arousing live music. We were still humming \"Por Una Cabeza\" into the wee small hours!Marcelo - muchas gracias y bien hecho"

I found Marcelo on Tripadvisor, sent him an e-mail and the next day we met him at our hotel at 10am.The first thing we did was discuss what we wanted to do for the day - I made some suggestions that included us going to Recoleta alone, but he advised against this. Following his advice, we strated the tour which would see us walking around the city. I had initially booked a half day tour, but it soon became apparent that in order to see everything we wanted, a full day was in order - plus by that stage we know just how good Marcelo was as a guide. There was so much more than just visiting the different sights, there was so much knowledge about the city and the history of the country to accompany this which made for a really interesting day, but still fun at the same time as Marcelo has a lovely warm manner about him.This is a fantastic way to see Buenos Aires, I am so glad that I chose Marcelo and would not hesitate to recommend."

Marcello's English is excellent, He is intelligent, organized, flexible, accommodating and also a very nice person! His knowledge of the history and culture of Buenos Aires is amazing and enhanced our trip. He also observed our family and modified the itinerary, with our consent, based upon what he thought we would enjoy most, and he was right. We highly recommend hiring him as your tour guide on your trip to Buenos Aires."

His pride in his country and city is obvious and has motivated him to learn and to make sure you understand the complex history that has created Buenos Aires. He is also charming and was willing to conduct the tour in measured and carefully enunciated Spanish so that I could practice my comprehension. I will continue to recommend Marcelo to anyone I know that is visiting BA, but reserve early -- he is popular for a good reason."

In terms of history, he doesn't bog you down with tons of dates and facts, but instead gives you the most important pieces of information so that you remember it and share it later with other friends. He answered our questions honestly. The half day flew by and by the end we felt we had a friend. All four of us afterwards talked about how happy we were to do this, and how pleased we were with Marcelo.If you are visiting BA, book a tour with Marcelo - you will not be disappointed!!"

We had the pleasure of meeting and touring with Marcelo on September 3rd, 2011 for a private half-day tour. We are so very glad that we did. We\u2019ve taken many tours in our travels, (including a few in Buenos Aires) - I think Marcelo was by far the best storyteller of the lot. He has a college degree in tourism and it shows. Marcello offers a great mix of anecdote, statistic, and historical fact-- setting a rich background and the context for each of his tales and each of the landmarks he points out. His stories were riveting, whether about the Mothers (and Grandmothers) of May Plaza or about the tragic Falklands War. Throughout our time I was truly impressed at his eye for interesting detail. In just a half day we covered a great deal of the city center by foot \u2013 and Marcelo was always quick to point out locations that we might enjoy returning to on our own. (We particularly loved his recommendation of the Confiteria Ideal.) At the end of our tour Marcelo sat with us for some time with the city map \u2013 pointing out areas and streets of interest. He then provided a whole printed folder containing wealth of activities, directions and restaurant recommendations. He was like a tour guide and travel concierge all in one! We want to thank Marcelo for such a perfect BA afternoon."

His style is a bit different from other guides, he does not rush so you can see 100 attractions in a day. He prefers to take a little more time, and give you the background, the history, the flavor and the culture. He will completely tailor your tour based on your preference. But my friends and I decided to let him choose, which worked out great. We did a 4 hour tour; and liked it enough to have a second day with another 4 hour tour. Each 4 hour tour was $80 USD for our small group. Mainly we did a lot of walking, but also took a couple of taxis. Marcelo also makes sure you are \"set\" for your entire stay, he gladly shares tons of ideas for places to go, his favorite restaurants, tango shows, or whatever you'd like to see. Thanks Marcelo!"

We contacted him after seeing his glowing reviews on here and he surpassed our expectations.I emailed him and replied very quickly with all of his information and what he could do for us. Before we got to BA we had already organised a tango show to see after reading the options for shows that Marcello told me about. (we decided to go to a hour long show at the cafe tortoni which was very fun and good value for money). He then helped us pay for it when we got there as he cleverly fit it in to our tour. He, of course, charged us nothing for this.He met us at our hotel and discussed with us what we wanted to do and then we set off! We wanted to know about the history about BA and some good spots to visit the next day we were there. He showed us a lot in 4 hours and the highlight was seeing the cemetery which he was very knowlodgeable about and told us very interesting stories about the different graves. Over lunch he gave us a map and a list of places/restaurants/safety information that we might need and told us need. And because me and mum had mentioned wine and food several times (!) we discussed the best restraunts to go to in more detail. It was great that he helped us plan the next day as we wouldn't of known what to do - and he wasn't pushy at all and didn't insist that we saw anything in particular.We paid him $80 USD for four hours but he was happy to stay for an hour longer free of charge but we paid him for it anyway as he was excellent and well worth the money.I have already suggested him to a few friends and the same recommendation goes to you!And lastly....THANK YOU MARCELLO!!! :D xxI just wanted to email you and say thank you so so so so much for all of your help whilst we were in BA and for helping us organise everything before while we were still in the UK. You were so fast at replying! I have given your details to three of the cabin crew which will be coming back in the next year or so. Your knowlodge of your city and history of it was excellent and I am very glad to have learnt about it (May 21st, 1810!!).We had an excellent time at the tango you organised for us and the next day was great as the itenery your helped us make took us to the best places which we throughly enjoyed! The market was great and I bought a cow skin rug for my living room! It was 600 pesos but in engald it would cost at least \u00a3200 (1800 or so pesos!!) so I was very very happy! We also found some good wine in the super market and so I am delighted with my souvenires! But most importantly are the memories...and my favourite part was the cematary with you tour and the facinating stories you told us, so thank you Marcello."

To call him a tour guide, is to greatly under-rate the quality of his services. Taking a tour around Buenos Aires with Marcelo is like having your best friend show you around his hometown. Marcelo is extremely knowledgeable (as would be expected of any guide), so what makes him stand out from other guides, is his true passion for his city, his sense of humour and his keen interest in you and how this translates into a tour that is tailored to your personality and interests. Beyond the tours, Marcelo provides excellent recommendations (including for accommodation, entertainment and wining/dining) and is more than happy to assist with any additional queries you may have, before and after the tour.

Also, he gave us very useful recommendations on restaurants, museums, shopping, and tango shows. We took his advice on several occasions and were never disappointed. We would highly recommend Marcelo to anyone who would like a personalized and informative tour of the city and its attractions at very reasonable rates."

Sophie showed me some hidden gems around the city including a beautiful family run leather business who made me a jacket and a few bags. The Tour definitely helped filter the usual tourist-junk from boutiques I'd actually want to buy things from. Thank you."

Sophie and I had communicated via internet prior to my trip to Buenos Aires. Unfortunately, the day I was leaving for BA she had a crisis that kept her out of the country. She had been working on an itinerary and agreed to work on the shopping experience long distance. At every shop they were expecting me, had an idea of what I wanted and were wonderful to deal with. The driver, \"Willie\" was excellent. Not only did he take me from shop to shop but also gave me a wonderful tour of BA. That was an added bonus. While I did not get a chance to interact in person with Sophie, she was always there on email. Since I do not speak Spanish I was concerned about communication, but she also made sure that everyone I engaged was competent in English.All in all a very good shopping experience.Tonyhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312741-d5982088-r417036091-Shop_Hop_BA_Tours-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html#"

I absolutely hate shopping malls, so this was a wonderful change of pace. Leading up to the trip, I had some routine (mundane) inquiries that Sophie addressed right away, instantly making me comfortable and at ease with my decision to utilize the shopping tour. Upon arrival, Sophie greeted us warmly and proceeded to take us to some hidden shops and introduced us to a few local designers. She is certainly well-connected in the local fashion community and we felt almost like celebrity VIPs being given access to places, people, and items that aren't readily available to the general public. Sophie created a customized and detailed itinerary completely unique to our preferences. With her connections, ability to speak the local language, and overall familiarity with BA, Sophie effortlessly alleviated stress on our end. My wife purchased a designer bag/purse and a custom tailored leather jacket. Our experience with Shop Hop BA was definitely a highlight of our trip and I would emphatically recommend Sophie's services to any future travelers/shoppers who happen to find themselves in Buenos Aires. Thanks again Sophie, you're awesome!"

I joined Sophie for a group tour on 30 July to Palermo Hollywood, Colegiales, Las Canitas and Almagro - finishing at a great bar in Palermo Hollywood. Sophie is absolutely lovely, professional and knows everyone. She finds up and coming artists and designers, and supports them by adding them to her tours and benefiting her clients by giving us entr\u00e9e into a world we would never find alone. Sophie also includes workshops that are run by women's collectives - all with very high quality items. I have been on two group tours, and also organised private tours for visiting friends and colleagues. There is never any pressure to buy anything - the first tour I went on I didn't buy one item and it was fine. You will meet lovely people, learn a lot about Buenos Aires, the artists and designers and people, and have a great day. Very highly recommended."

It starts with a simple questionnaire designed to gauge your preferences/style. She then follows up with a PDF that includes a brief description of her recommendations, along with a map at the end, with clear/helpful instructions for which stops require a cab, which can be walked, etc.From the start, my wife and I were impressed with the way Sophie coordinated BOTH our questionnaires. Meaning, she made recommendations to me and my wife separately, but she clearly designed it in a way that we could spend the day together. There were some places where there was overlap, and some that were dedicated to women or men, but close to each other. It all felt deliberate.Then we actually arrived, and started exploring on our own (we saved Sophie's suggestions for later in the week). This was neat, because we were able to explore shops and already see which designers/styles/etc. were working for us and which ones weren't. Then came time to dig into Sophie's recommendations...We are discerning (is that just a nice word for picky?). Let's just say we have the capacity to be critical. From the very start, we were PLEASANTLY surprised (and impressed) that Sophie's recommendations were absolutely spot-on in terms of delivering styles that rang true to us, as well as pushing us just a touch beyond our comfort zone (exactly as we suggested in our questionnaires). Now, having done personal shopping tours before, we haven't always felt like the professional on the other end was in-tune with our wavelength. Sophie, however, crushed it. I'd say just about EVERY recommendation was time well spent.She knows Buenos Aires, but maybe more importantly, she seemed to really GET what we were going for. My wife and I were really impressed and grateful. And her pricing is not just competitive, it's a steal.Recommend the itinerary highly, and I'd imagine her personal shopping tours are excellent as well, judging from the quality of this particular option."

I wasn't interested in clothes or shoes; goods that any normal shopper would be. I was interested in the handmade and artisan made goods ranging from jewelry to indigenous crafts. Sophie had plenty of places in mind that held my attention. She clearly has her finger on the shopping pulse in BA. Shop Hop BA is a terrific alternative to going to the malls, and you get to settle in with a glass of wine at the end of the tour. Sophie followed up after the tour to provide me excellent recommendations for restaurants. All in all, an excellent time spent with a warm and knowledgeable person."

I wasn't shopping for much, just a purse and a dress that were unique. There was no pressure to buy anything.Sophie had called ahead to private boutiques to show me some beautiful handbags and of course the first place we went to I fell in love with a purse that is timeless and I will have forever. A lovely reminder of my time in Buenos Aires.Sophie is also a stylist and has a wonderful eye. And she's lived such an interesting life! I was travelling by myself and it was great to enjoy her company for the day.This is definitely a worthwhile excursion. Sophie will customize the experience to fit your needs and budget.And if that wasn't enough, she gave me some great recommendations of bars, restaurants and experiences to enjoy during my stay.She definitely went above and beyond to create a wonderful afternoon of shopping and more!Highly, highly recommended!!!!"

Sophie took us to designers' showrooms and amazing boutiques. It was so wonderful to have Sophie take us to hidden gems and show us how to find unique, quality pieces. It was a special experience to talk to the designers and experience their passion for their work. There is no pressure to buy, but we found so many things we loved -- clothes and shoes for both of us, jewelry, handbags, and other souvenirs. Most importantly, Sophie is not only a fantastic guide but a great person. We felt like we were shopping with a friend. Our only regret is not spending more time with Sophie! She gave us some excellent recommendations to explore shops and restaurants on our own. If you enjoy shopping, Sophie's tour is a must do in Buenos Aires!"

It was so much fun being out and about with Sophie. She is extremely knowledgable and took to exactly the right shops that matched my personal tastes and interests. I loved meeting the shop owners/designers, and ended up purchasing a leather jacket (custom made, gorgeous and very reasonable), many pairs of hand-made designer shoes that were elegant and hip, and other beautiful leather items for gifts. Sophie even hooked me up with a woman who runs a weekly open mike/music night at an amazing local club/bar, and I was invited to come perform (I'm a musician and songwriter). That was an unforgettable experience--would have never happened but for Sophie."

I try to use local experts as they have their finger on the ever chafing pulse of Buenos Aires. If you are short on time, and really want to focus on finding the 'perfect' something... anything... Sophie is the girl for you! Not only can she calmly and expertly guide through the many options available but takes you to those special places you would never have found alone as well. We took the option of hiring a people mover which further maximised our shopping time and made the outing feel very personalised. During our time together Sophie made a number of other recommendations throughout the City for restaurants, bars, other retailers...many of which I followed up, all of which were excellent!

Sophie knew I was traveling to Argentina to get outfitted for my destination wedding (and a tango class!), that I wasn't a great shopper, that I couldn't say for certain what my non traditional attire should look like, my budget was right and I wouldn't have much time. She wasn't worried! She sent me a brief and painless survey, then sent me some designers to check out on Facebook prior to traveling. We emailed back and forth a couple times and as a result I felt more confident and clear in what I was looking for, but I was also better packed! She helped me focus in on what key pieces - shoes and pants - would help me keep my options open. When we met in person we hit the ground running and not only did I find the perfect outfit and shoes to get married in and enjoy Argentina, I met incredible people! Sophie has made super cool connections in vintage AND designer shops, in addition to jeweler and leather shops that would have been impossible to find on my own. She was so good at hitting just the right stores for my needs that everywhere we went we found success and we also had enough time to swing into an awesome leather shop where I picked up my favorite souvenir handbag made of the finest Argentine leather - it smells so good!! This non-shopper is eternally grateful for such a fun and adventurous experience with such a cool, laid back and down to earth person. Muchas gracias Sophie!"

Because of her I've really gotten to enjoy the truly unique shopping scene of Buenos Aires. I came to trust Sophie so much that I asked her to help me find a wedding dress. We spent a whole day visiting vintage shops and designer showrooms in search of the perfect dress and shoes. Sophie is so kind, and all of the designers and shop owners were very welcoming when we arrived. Sophie was patient and honest about everything I tried on. By the end of the day I had found a beautiful, one of a kind wedding dress and a killer pair of shoes. I felt amazing on my wedding day, and I have Sophie to thank for that. Having worked in the fashion industry in NY & Milan, I have high expectations when it comes to shopping and fashion- and Sophie has absolutely exceeded them."

Having booked a whole day tour with Sophie was the best thing we could ever do! We got to know fashion boutiques we usually would have never seen by passing through \"just\" the \"normal\" shopping districts. My girlfriend was searching for a special pair of shoes and Sophie knew exactly where to find it. It seemed like she knew everything about fashion and where to find it in this big amazing city. If you come to Buenos Aires, I can just recommend booking a tour with Sophie, even if you don't search for something in particular, you will guaranteed find some nice things and see a lot of secret spots in the city!"

She had great information on the designers/venues we visited and knew the products, materials and history of each.

I especially loved the leather shoes by Jessica Kessel, which are amazing and actually so reasonably priced, and the vintage shop. It was really clear as well that Sophie has a great relationship with all the shop owners that we went to. Aside from taking the stress out of shopping, it was also a super fun day out and I met some really nice people and felt a lot girlier that I usually do, which made a really nice change!

Myself and my boyfriend did the horse riding trip with Miriam and had a fantastic day!We only had 4 days in BA but wanted to see a little bit of the countryside so this trip was ideal for us. From the initial point of booking, the communication and organisation was friendly and professional. Miriam arranged pick up at a central location in BA and we were taken to a beautiful park about 40 minutes drive out of the city. We were both beginner house riders but by the end we were cantering freely through the forest and feeling very confident. The Horses are beautifully kept and very well trained and the direction from Miriam was great - this is definitely much more than a standard trek through a nice area which you might expect on these types of trips. As well as the tuition, Miriam and her family are wonderful hosts - friendly and welcoming and full of local knowledge about Argentina so we really enjoyed talking to her - and especially the mate and delicious home made empanadas! :-) We were lucky to have great weather on this day but even without it was lovely to see something more than just the city. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to see a little more than the usual tourist sites."

In a Argentinian economy where making money is mainly a priority to everything else, Adrien and Mirjam showed us it is still possible to put Hospitality at nr 1. We came as horselovers and left as family, we will definitely be back!! Wishing you all the best, the crazy sisters from Holland;-)"

We were imagining a short, slow \"trail ride\" along a well-worn trail preceded by limited instruction. Although the TripAdvisor reviews were glowing, nothing prepared us for this wonderful adventure. We were picked up downtown by Adrian and treated to an entertaining and good natured narrative of all that is good and bad about Argentina's economy, politics, culture and society on the short ride to their beautiful stables in the national park. we were introduced to Miriam (Adrian's wonderfully down-to-earth Dutch business partner) their adorable dogs and some of their good tempered and well-cared-for horses.We had booked a \u201cmorning:\u201d session \u2013 I think the pick-up time was 10 am. We had a nice get-aquainted session over mate (Adrian gave an informative fun \u201cseminar\u201d on it\u2019s preparation, consumption and social traditions) then we got geared up (love their \u2018helmets\u2019!) had a short but intense lesson (we were pretty much beginners) which was very useful and made the experience much better and more comfortable than any \u201ctrail ride\u201d we had been on in the past.Then off we went for a couple of hours (time flies! It may have been longer) of riding in the beautiful national park surrounding the stables. We could basically go wherever we wished \u2013 there was no trail or set plan. Miriam knew the park like the back of her hand. We walked, trotted, cantered \u2013 with Miriam\u2019s instruction and encouragement we felt like experienced \u201cgauchos\u201d in no time. The horses were extremely well trained and easy to ride and the park is wide open so you can ride \u201cside-by-side\u201d (as the name implies) and chose your course. Miriam was a charming and pleasant riding companion with perfect English; it was just us two and her and I understand that is typical \u2013 the groups are kept very small.After the ride we enjoyed a delicious lunch of empanadas then reluctantly headed back to the city (again the ride was pleasant and included in the price.This experience is worth every peso and has earned every one of the 5 star ratings it has received.

It was simply a stunning experience under all points of view. After getting to know Adrian and Miriam enjoying a delicious mate, I met the horses. Theses are undoubtedly the best trained horses I have ever had the chance to ride: besides being so elegant and powerful, they are highly attentive to each instruction and at the same time always at ease while walking, trotting or galloping in the wilderness of the marvelous \"El Palmar\". If you get used to these horses, it will be difficult to switch to other ones: they simply make horse riding look too easy!! Adrian and Miriam are splendid persons that will welcome you and make you feel at home from the very first second.

When we arrived at the ranch Myriam waited for us with a Matte. I have a very good level and he has a beginner level. I rode a very pleasant horse, Wyoming a Arabian race, my dad rode Isabel a criollo race it had very quiet temper. This was a very good experience and the atmosphere was very friendly! \u2764"

Caballos a la Par tops them all. Owner/Operator Aidrian and partner Miriam have created a haven for their well trained, well cared for horses in a beautiful setting and provided a unique experience for those of us lucky enough to share it with them. From an easy pick up location in the city to sharing mate before the ride and homemade empanadas after the ride, every extra detail felt like a special gift. They provided excellent hands-on guidance during a personalized Argentinian-style ride through a Unesco heritage bio reserve that I will carry with me forever. They are passionate about what they do - even their rescue dogs are loving and happy! Perfect, memorable day rounding out a wonderful first-time trip to Buenos Aires."

We felt immediately at home. They shared a traditional Argentina ceremony with us, the drinking of Mate. Which was a great experience and a nice way to get to know each other before riding the horses.The horses were really sweet and nice, and also well taken care of. The stables were clean and well maintained. It was good to see that they really cared about their horses. The horse riding itself was great! They gave us enough time to get to know your horse before starting the outdoor riding. We had a group of experienced and not experienced (two had never been on a horse before) riders and they had a matching horse for everyone. They gave us good and constructive instructions while riding the horses. Everyone really enjoyed the outdoor trip we made together, the nature, the horses and the company.I would definitely recommend everyone to go here for a trip and you'll definitely leave with a big smile and great feeling of an amazing day!"

Adrian and Miriam run a first class operation where the horses are happy, well trained (but by no means dull), and extremely well cared for. Helmets and half chaps are provided, so you do not need to pack much riding gear. They do not mix groups of people, so two of us rode with Adrian for the entire time. He was an enthusiastic teacher, a great guide, and we learned a lot. The park is huge and unspoiled. From our first mate to the post ride empanadas, we felt like welcome friends. This was a highlight of our trip to Argentina, and we recommend it! Mary Lynn and Hernan"

We were in BA for 6 nights and thought we had seen everything the city had to offer until we headed to Caballos a la Par on our last day. By the time we had been dropped off at the end of the day both my wife and I agreed that it was by far our favourite experience in BA! From the moment you meet Miriam you can tell that she is a warm, friendly and downright delightful person! She makes you feel so comfortable and the whole car ride to the stables we chatted like old friends. Hands down the best thing about this experience is the fact that they don't do big groups and so it was just my wife and I riding through the park with Miriam for over 2 hours. We've both been on lots of other \"rides\" where it's nose to tail the whole way with a massive group and the horses are happy with going through the old walk-trot-walk routine and have often arrived back at the stables feeling as bored as the horses. The horses at Caballos trained by Adrian and Miriam are completely different!!. They're perfectly (and incredibly sensitively) trained. Just a small movement of the reigns up the neck at any time and they will transition smoothly into a canter that leaves you feeling like you're sitting in an armchair and then when you want to slow down it's just a gentle pull on the reigns instead of an epic tug of war! The horses also have no trouble leading, following or riding side by side and they all get along really well too which is also unique! They also pick the horse for you dependant on your abilities and confidence...and they absolutely nailed it for both my wife (beginner/intermediate) and myself (more experienced). Adrian and Miriam are absolutely delightful people to be around too - genuine, friendly and accommodating. Adrian prepared us matte (Argentinian tea) which was delicious, a great way to get to know each other, and it was really nice to see the process and how the tradition worked. Also, after the ride we came back to the house, sat down around their kitchen table with a cuppa and chatted into the night! Honestly, such genuine, lovely people and such perfectly trained horses, plus a ride through stunning National Parks makes this experience one of the best we've EVER had while travelling! An absolute must!!"

The horses were fantastic, they were so responsive and trusting it makes riding them so much easier than I have ever experienced with other, so called excellent, riding stables. There were two of us with vast differences in riding ability yet Adrian managed to have us both enjoy the time together, a rare skill, but a skill indeed. The horses were brilliant, the people were brilliant, the experience was brilliant. I would recommend it to anyone, a fabulous afternoon and worth every minute of it."

If you want to experience a free and real horseback riding in the woods, this is the place! We were received by Adrian, who spent some time with us to understand our level of horseback riding and personality to match it to the horses. We drank some mate and off we went. The horses were great, easy to manage. The place is huge and you really feel you are not near Buenos aires. We spent around 3 hours and so on the horses, galloping and also experiencing some synchronized horseback riding. Even if you have never horseback ride, this is the place to try it and if you are experienced, this is too. I totally recommend it."

This is by far the best experience I've had horse riding as a tourist. When I booked on the internet, I thought it was a group excursion, but it is actually reserving an entire day/private tour with the folks who own and train the horses. Miriam and Adrian met with me before the ride to ask what I wanted to do, and determine experience. I asked to learn any Argentinean styles. Miriam and I took the horses up the road and into the national park and rode for hours. I learned so much and she even had me change horses to practice my new skills on a different horse. It was an absolute privilege to have this type of experience in Argentina. I was so lucky to have found them. If you want to really ride horses when you visit, call this ranch."

            "review": "Amazing day out of BA city. My partner and I shared an amazing day with Adrian and Miriam in early August. Adrian collected us from our meeting point in the city and drove us out to their stables bordering the national park. Adrian and Miriam made us feel super comfortable and we had a great chat over mate (tea) about life in BA and their horses. Following this we went to meet our horses for the few hours we would spend with Adrian riding in the park. We were given a good intro and briefing to the horses and the riding style and were on our way. Adrian is a FANTASTIC guide/instructor/teacher and both my partner and I felt like we learnt a lot to improve our riding (we are probably intermediate level) regardless of riding style (western vs English). We definitely feel as though we came away with more confidence and new skills - I didn't think I would be cantering one handed after only a couple of hours! After riding around the beautiful park (freely - not following a set path or route), we went back and had a beer and empanadas with Adrian and Miriam which was really great. Finished the day with Adrian dropping us back in the city.For anyone looking for a real experience with Argentine horses, I 110% recommend this day. It is not for you if you are expecting an easy nose to tail (aka boring) trail ride. Adrian and Miriam want you to learn and be a bit challenged by the activity and to improve your skills. We both had a great time and would recommend to anyone heading to BA who would like to have some time with horses and get out and see a bit of the countryside.THANK YOU!"

My family and I had come to Argentina for summer holidays and we all love horseback riding, and since we were in the land of horses, it was a must. Through tripadvisor and other websites, we found this hidden gem, and undoubtedly it was the highlight of our trip. Adrian picked us up at our hotel, warmly greeting us with a customary kiss, and whisked us away into the beautiful surrounding countryside of Buenos Aires. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by Miriam and the energetic band of dogs. We were also introduced to the lovely volunteer, Maria. They gave us a tour of the property and the high level of care given to the horses was evident. Few other places I have been to have exhibited this standard. All the horses were well groomed and had a clean/insulated barn to go to for the night, as it was winter and very cold. We then enjoyed a traditional Argentine mate, my very first, and were instructed in the rituals of drinking and serving. Adrian and Miriam told us about how they began horseback riding and why the started the business, and after donning helmets and half-chaps we were ready to go! Adrian gave us a quick demo on the basics such as turning, and explained the way the horse were trained using the A La Par method. We rode through beautiful fields and wooded areas on some of the most stunning horses I have ever seen much less ridden. Indio, Isabel, Lindo, and Sheik all were calm yet had a lively step and were a pleasure to ride. Miriam had us practice cantering and trotting, and then took it up a level by doing it standing up and without hands. There were exercise a like trying to trot as slowly as possible without the horse walking. Finally to top it off Miriam had us ride under a low hanging branch while controlling our body position as well as the horse. We arrived back for some excellent Argentine facturas (little pastries) and wished we could have spent weeks and weeks riding with them. Adrian then drove us back to the hotel and we thanked him for such a memorable day. Caballos A La Par is such a unique place, with fantastic horses and such inspiring people who are running it. The ideas on which Miriam and Adrian have built the way they train the horses and teach you to ride are so cool and it provides for a custom riding experience tailored to fit your level as well as the people you come riding with (although they never mix groups). It mixes Argentine culture and wonderful horseback riding to create a memorable expirience my family and so will never forget."

However to anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation, I assure you that despite non perfect weather we still had a fantastic day and say the national park in all of its beauty!

Miriam and Adrian are passionate about horses and teaching you to ride with proper technique while having fun. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is not a group-based, touristy horseback ride. Instead, it is a private, tailor-made experience to ride a variety of well trained horses in a unique setting.

The trips are customised for you, so take the time to think about what you want from the day. The area you ride in is an old estancia, now a national park. There is a lot of open grass and woodland so it is perfect riding country and it is huge. You will need to adjust to riding Argentine style as that is the way that the horses are schooled - but that just adds to the experience.Adrian and Miriam have created something very special with this business.

When we were ready, we went to meet our horses and Adrian showed us in no uncertain terms how to control the horses (in very good English!). We then hopped on board and after practicing some steering through a row of plastic barrels we were on our way. We headed off into the wonderful countryside surrounding the stables and enjoyed numerous walks, trots and canters through the fields and woods, with Adrian enthusiastically filming us and taking lots of photos along the way. The horses were very obedient and Adrian offered to swap with me so I could try out his sprightly Arab that he was training for endurance riding.After about 1.5 - 2 hours we arrived back at the yard, jumped off our horses and headed inside the house for some delicious empanadas.I'm very much looking forward to visiting Adrian's place again when I return at Christmas, with Julia & Daisy."

My boyfriend and I love horses and have some riding history in Europe so we definitely wanted to experience horse riding while we were in Buenos Aires :)Our day with Caballos A La Par was excellent! The horses are healthy, kind and happy, and riding with them was very natural and easy. We spent around 3h riding in a beautiful reserve after a quick lesson on Argentinian riding style. Adrian gave us constant feedback so we could improve our posture and style along the way. Miriam and Adrian are great persons. They are passionate, dedicated and were very kind to us and the horses. They welcomed us wholeheartedly and were very attentive to our confort and expectations. A great experience that I hope to live again and that I would strongly recommend, should you be looking for genuine connection with horses and with great people!Thank you Miriam & Adrian!Melodie"

The first 30 mins was a quick lesson on riding ' Argentinian style' and after that we were off, trotting and cantering around the most beautiful reserve. I even got the chance to swap horses half way round and rode this gorgeous Arabian for the rest of the morning! Such a brilliant day and I would highly recommend to anyone who loves horses and riding. Thanks again Adrian and Miriam!"

Adrian and his business partner Miriam were gracious hosts and it was enlightening learning about their lives here. They also spoke perfect English. After some chatting and tea, we mounted our horses. Adrian took us out, and was an excellent trainer. We previously had very little experience with horses, but he made us feel comfortable, and challenged us as our knowledge grew. The horses responded very well to us. We rode through a beautiful nature preserve for about 2 hours, and worked up to cantering. Afterwards we had delicious empanadas before heading back to BA. Overall we highly recommend this experience."

My wife and I decided against the cliche groucho tour, where by all accounts you get whisked in and out of a ranch like cattle. I stumbled upon the Caballos tour and thought we would give it a go. I have to admit as a bit of a sceptic I was a little put off by how amazing the reviews are as they seemed a bit too good to be true but I needn't have worried. The day started with us being an hour and half late for our pick up in town (it wasn't our fault due to crazy protests) but when we arrived Adrian, one of the owners/instructors/and our driver, couldn't have been nicer. We drove for a short while until we reached their ranch. We sat and had some mate (argentinian tea) with the other owner and our guide for the day Miriam. We got to know a lot about the business and their way of life and it was the perfect start to the day. We are both novices and utterly clueless when it comes to horse riding but we both had excellent horses who followed our instructions and Miriam had us galloping and riding around the beautiful national park in no time. Her guidance and help was just right and we spent a few hours just riding around the woods. Afterwards we spent time with the co-owners Miriam and Adrian talking about our riding and watching back videos they took of us riding. In addition to our riding they were both so generous with their time, before and after our ride, and it give us a brilliant insight into the business and themselves. Words perhaps don't quite do this day justice, but for me it was simplistic, relaxed and unbelievably enjoyable. If you do one thing in Buenos Aires i suggest this, even if you've never been on a horse before. It's a million miles away from the obvious tourist attractions you see on a normal holiday and for me will be the thing I remember most when I look back on this holiday. Oh and don't be put off by the amazing reviews. They are right! :)"

The horses are very healthy and well-oven, the farm and the business is incredible, and Miriam is a great instructor filled with the vibrancy of life. She takes many photos and videos (to be honest, that is very nice and appreciated, but it would have been nice to just ride without having photos taken for a while, too; but that is a small complaint) and is a very patient teacher. I had not been on a horse for many years but within an hour I was feeling at home in the saddle. The park is very beautiful and close to Buenos Aires. If you have a morning or an afternoon to spare, you should go for a ride. You won't forget it."

I have been horseback riding other places, and this was absolutely the best horseback riding experience I have ever had. It was both an adventure and educational and the nature and surroundings were breath taking. The horses do not follow each other on a line on trails like most other places I have visited. You actually have to learn how to control the horse and make it listen to you. I felt safe the whole time being on the horse, because Adrian told us exactly what to do and when to do it. Adrian and Miriam are both wonderful people, and it was really nice getting to know them.The best part was the way they treated the horses, with positive reinforcement. The sabels were clean and tidy and the experience was absolutely one of a kind, and I would definitely recommend it to others, both beginners and advanced riders - as Adrian adjusts the riding to your level."

Here on the newly built estancia, Adrian and Miriam showcase their excellent newly built facilities. Starting with a traditional matte, they skilfully walk you through what to expect, a tailored experience for your party. I am not a horseman and was anxious. There was no need. These horses have been trained with a classical Argentine methodology. They respond to the minute commands you offer them and are simply sensational. It led to a wonderful afternoon out riding in countryside, and really learning something, at the sine time feeling safe. Miriam is an excellent tutor. Within a couple of hours she had us cantering. It was exhilarating and we got the bug for doing it again, surely the hallmark of great teaching. Returning to the ranch for coffee and cake, we left by moonlight after a wonderful day out. Big thanks to both for a great learning and memory from BA. Couldn't recommend it more highly."

And forget the group-based touristy ranches; you want to go horseback riding with Caballos a la Par if what you're looking for is riding in a beautiful nature reserve, with well-behaved horses and skilled teachers who have a lot of heart.Until today I had zero experience with horses (quite frankly I've always been intimidated by them - hey, they're bigger than humans and I'm tiny). But before the end of it I felt confident of my abilities in the saddle. Miriam and Adrian (who both own the place) are sincerely interested in sharing their love of the horses and of teaching you how to ride with proper technique, with great attention to detail from the mate they serve to the proper technique in horse riding to the delicious homemade empanadas. You're in very good hands here and you're paying for quality care and one to one attention. This is definitely a must do if you love spending time outdoors. Thank you for a very special memory!"

And they sure know how to share it with you.My girl-friend and I had different riding experience and hadn't ridden for quite sometime. But they took the time to see what we wanted and what we needed.After that, riding was just great even though it was very different to what we are used to in Europe. You can feel how happy the horses are and how important it is for their owners to share their passion for them.On top of that, we got to ride in a beautiful location which would worth visiting at different time of the year to see it change.We enjoyed our ride very much and would recommend it to anyone looking for an off-track experience."

The day we booked far in advance was cancelled because of the weather and Miriam was great at keeping in touch with us and doing her best to rearrange for us to come the next day. Adrian picked us up and was really friendly on the lift to the stables. It\u2019s such a beautiful relaxing place set in nice countryside and with big paddocks where the horses roam free and there are four very friendly doggies. This is more than just a bog standard trail ride and we really felt that from the very beginning. Miriam and Adrian sat with us and taught us the Mate tea ritual and we chatted and got to know them a bit, all of it helps you relax as we are both horse riding beginners. Then it was on to the horses, I had Indiyo and my boyfriend had Isabelle. Both were good horses for us as beginners, I think they had been trained to be so, as it was quite easy to pick it up. Not too easy where you felt like the horse was following another horse but where they listened and responded to your commands. We did a few exercises to learn Argentinan/Western style of riding which is so much nicer and more comfortable than English style of riding and then we went out to the meadows in the surrounding area. It was so pretty to ride through all the scenery and we loved every second. Very quickly Miriam got us to trot and canter, was really encouraging and kept reminding us to sit up straight or to keep heels down! We did lots of fun exercises like cantering without the reins and Miriam took loads of photos and videos whilst constantly helping us improve. It was just such a fun experience!Then at the end we relaxed outside eating some of the best empanadas of our trip (beaten by only one other empanada we had in Mendoza!) and then sadly had to leave. We were so happy after we left, we would love to go back to learn more when we next come.It is quite pricey but it is completely worth it and it helps keep them in business which they need to be. Also try to make sure you arrange enough time to use the swimming pool and relax after as the timing of our day made the end a bit rushed which was unfortunate as we would have loved to have stayed for longer. Don\u2019t miss out on this!"

First off, let me say it feels silly to call this a \"horseback riding activity,\" because in actuality it is SO much more than that. Adrian and Miriam provide a full Argentine experience, that just so happens to include horseback riding (which is amazing, might I add!) From the moment we arrived at the beautiful, scenic ranch, it felt like we were visiting friends in another country. We sat around the kitchen table with Miriam and Adrian, and shared Mate (traditional Argentinian tea), just chatting and getting to know one another. Then, Miriam introduced us to the horses, and gave a brief, yet thorough and simplistic overview of how to ride. \"Be a rider, not a passenger!\" I should mention that neither my boyfriend or myself had ever really ridden before, but in just two short hours, we were cantering through open fields, riding fearlessly - even without hands at some points! It was amazing! After the ride, we again, sat back around the kitchen table to enjoy some incredible homemade empanadas! We were so sad to leave the ranch -- it really felt like we made great friends in Miriam and Adrian. If you are in Buenos Aires and have a half a day, I STRONGLY encourage you to book with Miriam and Adrian! It is absolutely worth every penny (and then some). We left with memories that will last a lifetime!!"

I have been on horse treks with friends where the horses are slogged out and tired, you taken over a well worn track that each animal knows every hoof placement by heart which leaves you feeling like a sack of potatoes on a horse food train or on a fair ground carousel without the lights, the up and down movement and music. Adrian and Miriam insist you ride. The horses are well trained with character and discipline. You instantly feel that these are horses who are loved and can move. Adrian was fastidious ensuring that each undestood the key elements of riding. Position in the saddle, hands, feet and movement. Once horse and rider were sorted Miriam took us for a good ride around the enormous open park, encouraging and correcting as we went. As confidence and competance dictated, the rding standard was lifed. Shortly it was galloping. Having fun. This was no nose to tail slow dawdle designed to bore you as much as the horse. These horses took off. They slowed and stopped when commanded. Changed direction as the rider wished. This was horse riding. Over two hours of serious fun. Simple the best ride ever for me. I was deeply impressed by the professsionalism the love Adrian and Miriam have for what they do. A genuine experience by people who love horses, riding and inspiring people to see and feel what they do. You can't ask for more than that. I would highly reccommed Caballos A La Par, Adrian and Miriam to any and every one."

Quite incredible people!When I read the other reviews (which are all excellent), the common thread is that Adrian and Miriam allow you to step outside of your comfort zone in a safe environment. It is usually in those times that we create the most memorable memories. Beginners are able to canter across the fields, and often with no hands! I asked Miriam to teach me how to gallop on Indio! Something I have never done before and will never forget! They have spent years training their horses to take care of the rider so that people could experience the exhilaration of riding. I have two horses and I don\u2019t feel as safe on them as I did on Indio. Make no mistake, these are not your dull trail horses either that have no life to them.

If this is something you think you might like to do, it's best to book for the start of your holiday as if the weather is not good you need time to re-book as you really would not want miss out on this experience."

This was the only place that would match you with an appropriate horse for your riding skill level and then allow you to ride the horse and not just follow eachother in a line at a walk. My friend had no riding experience, while I had 10+ years, so I was able to ride ahead and our guide, Miriam, taught my friend how to ride on a very easy, well-trained horse. The horses are great and the business is very locally owned. You are given drinks and food to eat before and after you ride, but be mindful that you will not be able to bring any water during the ride, so be hydrated! I had a great time and would definitely go back, as an experienced rider! Everything was easy and fun for the both of us."

It was the perfect end of our travels and I would definately go there again if I travel to Argentina. I've done a lot of horseriding in my life and my friend has not but this is a place that really suits both beginners and experienced riders, and you will both enjoy the ride. There is a lot of touristy riding places where they randomly put people on a horse and let them ride in a long line, and at the end the beginners will not learn anything and the experienced riders wont get anything out of it. This place is the total opposite of that! Adrian was a perfect teacher, riding side by side with us and teaching the style of riding (western) at the same time. And he works magic, my friend who hasn't been riding for 25 years time where able to trot and canter all by herself and in control of her horse! As for me, I really enjoyed the western style and also the freedom to canter ahead in the park. The horses were just so fantastic and beautiful! This place is really a must do! It's a beautiful way to spend a day from the busy city of Buenos Aires and get some countryside calmness whilst hanging around with friendly people and amazing horses (and dogs)! Thank you Miriam and Adrian for having us!"

I am a complete novice but within 2 hours for the first time in my life I was riding with confidence in myself and the horse while my wife is more experienced she was riding with no hands on the reins as an exercise. I had never done more than a trail nose to tail but a la par means side by side across open and wooded terrain and you are taught how to do this and connect with the horse . The horses are exceptionally well trained but you still must learn how to communicate and control your activity.So this like a very private lesson just you and instructor not a group of strangersAdrian and Miriam are very welcoming and at no point are you made to feel you are running out of time - two hours means on the horse while we spent an hour before and after getting to know our instructor and of course the other way round so that the horse is chosen for you your ability and especially your character. If you like me have never connected with riding before try this experience - it is far better than a dude ranch unless you want a show etc this is very personal and enjoyable If you have time while in BA try this even before tango!Tip - allow time to get to pick up point and book direct to get all the details"

Neither of us had ridden before and we arrived with quite modest expectations about what we'd be able to accomplish. This experience was so memorable because, from the very beginning, Miriam gave us the techniques and the confidence to really take control of the horse. As novice riders this was a huge thrill, and we came away having trotted and cantered across the beautiful reserve for hours - vowing that we would do it again (which we did in Patagonia!) Caballos a La Par was one of the highlights of our Argentine honeymoon and will live long in the memory. Miriam is an outstanding teacher and a generous host - we felt in professional hands the entire time - and it's clear she has a love for her beautiful horses. Such a fun activity within easy striking distance of Buenos Aires - this is a strong recommendation."

            "review": "Great Experience but $$. Don't get me wrong, this is a great experience for those travelling to BA and we loved our time with Miriam but having done some many rides around the world, we're not sure if it was worth the price? Let me explain... PROS*The tour is run privately, just you and your partner/family which means you get a lot of time to practice cantering, trotting and there is a lot of flexibility within the group. This meant we could canter on the way home and we loved it. The ride isn't a trail ride, it's more than that and probably the one ride which has allowed us to really want to do more riding when we return home. *Miriam takes some amazing photos and videos of your experience that you will keep forever. She is also a wonderful teacher who instills you with confidence. *Miriam rescues a lot of horses who aren't treated well and gives them a better life. She really does love her horses and treats them with so much respect. My wife thought of the extra cost as a \"donation to helping the horses life a better life\" and that helped her accept the premium.*The horses are great and very well suited to the experience. CONS*The fee had to be paid in cash. Given the current economic climate in Argentina, I understand the problem with banking, paypal etc. but withdrawing all those pesos is a nightmare for travellers and carrying that much cash isn't ideal.*Having paid a little over and above, we would have loved something a little extra - perhaps a wine or a beer upon completion? Or even the opportunity to sit outside by the pool? We're not really sure what was missing, but a little something extra would have made us feel more comfortable with spending the extra $$.*Miriam is lovely and we had a great day, but we noticed she did spend a lot of time on her phone. We understand she was running the business on her own at that time, but her full attention would have meant a few of our cons listed above were addressed at that time - enhancing our experience.  At the end of the day, we enjoyed our time with Miriam but the cost was just a little expensive given whats available everywhere else in the world. Would have happily spent the day with another couple to reduce the premium."

Miriam served us traditional mate tea and snacks as we discussed our riding background. All four of us had some riding experience, but had not been horseback riding for many years. Horses were selected to meet our various riding levels, and we were soon geared up & ready to head out. The ride is through a beautiful park with trees, fields and streams. Miriam is an excellent teacher and we were soon trotting and cantering through fields and streams. It really is like a movie setting.

Fantastic atmosphere to ride in, warm and delicious empanadas to eat and extremly loving and charming people to share stories with. I would of paid double of what they asked for to experience this. I wish I lived closer and would go there every week to ride and take lessons. This opportunity is a hidden gem that should be experienced and known to everyone that visits this area. I wish I could send my horse to be trained by Adrian who can read a horse's emotions and trains with humanity. This riding experience is the best I've ever had the opportunity to be involved with in my life and I've been riding for over 34 years. I didn't want to leave and can't believe there isn't a waiting line at the gate. Don't pass up this amazing experience to really learn how to ride and experience how you can become one with beautiful well trained animal. Thank you Adrian and family for making me feel special. Please rememaber to tip generously. I personally think they should be charging more for this experience. My heart is full after meeting Adrian, his family, and amazing ranch and horses."

To my surprise during the last part of the ride we were all cantering together! The instruction is great and makes you improve your riding quickly. I am an experienced rider but also learned a lot. There are horses for riders with different levels of experience, all of them so well-behaved. The park is beautiful and the people are friendly. For all of us this was the highlight of our stay in Buenos Aires!"

After a half day riding at Caballos a la Par, I'm certainly not an expert, but I have gained an entirely new appreciation for the art of riding. The environment was beautiful, the people warm and welcoming, and the horses absolutely lovely. An amazing afternoon!"

I'd ridden a couple times before but nothing formal, and wow did I realize I had been not doing things wrong per say, but missing out on quite a bit of very useful information, ranging from how to hold the stirrups, how to position my legs, to how to even just sit on the horse. Adrian was an excellent instructor who provided continuous encouragement but also corrections so by the end of just one lesson, I felt that I had improved vastly! You learn a lot each lesson, so with just a couple you already feel that like you're a experienced rider! The horses are all beautiful and clearly well-cared for. I had the joy of riding Indio, who was well-tempered and quick to listen to my commands. The park that you ride in is also just a treat with lush grass and beautiful trees as well. The A la Par staff are also incredibly friendly and accommodating, almost so that you feel like you're visitng a friend's house, and I greatly look forward to my next visit! I highly recommend you take advantage of this opportunity while in Buenos Aires."

The reception was warm, the horses are wonderful and the tutoring is brilliant. We managed to walk, trot and canter with the horses during the 2 hour + lesson. Riding (with the instructor at your side) through the National Park makes you feel totally free. Collected and dropped off from Buenos Aires in 30 min. Can not fault it. Highly recommended."

If however, you want to experience a true horseback riding experience, please read on.....To give some context, I used to take riding lessons when I was a kid but stopped riding as an adult and have probably ridden 5 times in the last 5 years. I spend about 1/2 of the year in Argentina and got the bug to pick it up again. I signed up for 4 private classes with Adrian and Miriam at Caballos a La Par and I am absolutely blown away at how much I have learned in such a short period of time. Their horses are impeccably trained. The park where you ride is beautiful and offers a wide variety of terrain (plenty of room to gallop, stream crossings, forests, etc). Their base where you are greeted is warm and inviting and you will feel like you are visiting friends while there.I have nothing but praise for the unique experience they provide and am so thankful that I found Adrian and Miriam. They are very special people who have followed their passion and do an amazing job at passing that same passion along to others."

I started to take private horseback riding classes in September with 'Caballos A La Par' and it did not take long for me to feel part of the \u2018A La Par\u2019 family. I had never ridden horses before and was quite nervous upon arrival. It only took a 15 minute chat with both Adrian and Miriam \u2013 who were incredibly welcoming and friendly - to calm down my nervousness. In fact, by the time I was on the horse Isabela (who is a lovely, well-tempered mare) I was eager to gallop! My first private class was with Adrian and he took the time to teach me the very basics of horse-riding; from getting onto the back of the horse, to holding the reins, and adjusting the stirrups. We then spent a good amount of time going over a proper riding posture. Till this day, I appreciate Adrian\u2019s insistence on getting this posture right from the very beginning, because - now that I ride more frequently - I realize that such posture is very important to be able to ride well. The class was very fun and Adrian pushed me to my limits that by the end I was able to canter! I was honestly surprised with myself. I had thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve much in the first few hours of riding, but was completely wrong! I continue to take clases with A La Par and feel very much at home every time I am there. I would highly recommend getting in touch with Adrian, Miriam or the rest of the A La Par team for horseback riding lessons or any form of cabalgata."

Not just bang on its back as it carries you on a nose-to-tail trail rides where you are only allowed to walk, but trot, cantor and may be even gallop if you can. The horses are well trained and it allowed me to max on my abilities and I felt like a much better rider at the end of the trip.If you in Buenos Aries for more then 2 days, do yourself a favor and try horseback riding with Caballos A La Par and enjoy true Argentinian experience.Good luck to those travelers who will read this review and many thanks to Adrian and Miriam for the amazing time I had."

They never give you group lessons unless you specifically request it so I had a one-to-one lesson with Miriam. Miriam is a very patient and caring teacher who focuses on and helps you to develop and improve your riding technique and I learnt so much from her in that half day.Although I was a complete beginner, I was already learning to canter by the end of my visit! It was lovely to be able to ride the horses freely in the huge reserve and to go through bamboo groves and forests as we pleased. Although only a short drive from Buenos, it really does feel like you've exited the hustle and bustle of the city and entered a realm of tranquility.The Caballos team, comprising Adrian, Miriam and Bart, is such a welcoming and friendly team. They included me like one of the family, taught me about the traditions of drinking mate, showed me around the stables and even drove me back to my hotel afterwards.It was a shame that I only discovered this place on the final day in Buenos - I would definitely have returned for more lessons if I had known about it earlier. Needless to say, I will definitely be dropping in again on my next visit to Buenos!"

I've brought co-workers, friends and most recently my sister along, and they have loved it just as much as I have. It's completely different from ordinary \"trail rides\" where the horses just follow the leader, and maybe if you're lucky you get to canter for a bit at the end. Instead, it's just you and Adrian exploring the surrounding area, sometimes on trails and sometimes not, walking if you want to walk, cantering if you want to canter, with Adrian coaching you continuously on how best to control your horse and helping you improve, no matter how much you think you already know. Before and after your ride, there is pastry and conversation and a chance to wander around the beautiful grounds looking at the horses and playing with the various dogs and cats around the place. Every single time it's a perfect day."

They are both so kind and welcoming, and this makes Caballos a la Par a truly unique place. We saw the good reviews at Tripadvisor, but the riding class was even better than we expected! We had little or no prior experience with horseback riding (my boyfriend had literally never ridden a horse before), but Adrian was a very patient instructor, making us feel safe and challenging us at the same time. The horses Indio and Isabel where highly trained, and where very easy to handle - even for us. After riding for a little while we actually felt we had learnt a lot about horseback riding, cantering without hands as a highlight. The national park was beautiful and huge (i think we only saw a fraction of it during our 3-hour ride) and ideal for horseback riding. Both before and after the horseback riding we spent time with Miriam and Adrian at their lovely house. First they introduced us to the traditional Argentine tea mate, and after our ride, we were served hot chocolate and pastries in front of the fire place. All in all we had a great time and only wish we had discovered Caballos a la Par sooner so we could have come again during our stay in Buenos Aires!"

Our time with Caballos A La Par was more than a horseback riding event, this was a cultural experience that was the highlight of our time in Buenos Aires. Let me say that both my husband and I have very limited horseback riding experience, and the training I had as a child for typical western riding on \"trail horses\" left me with bad habits for this type of riding....however, Adrian and Miriam easily helped me to transition to the Argentinian way of riding. The first thing we noticed is how passionate they are about the horses and animals in general. If you are an animal lover, like we are, you will be very much at home here. The day began with a quick meeting point at the edge of San Telmo, Adrian picked us up and after a quick 20-30 minute ride to the country we were at the beautiful national park and their location....entering the gates we saw all the horses free and roaming along with the dogs and cats. We shared lovely conversation prior to the riding and enjoyed getting to know Adrian and Miriam, then off to the horses! The key to success is learning the proper balance of your body on the horse. The positions were discussed and demonstrated and within minutes we were testing our new skills around the yard, then off to the woods for a beautiful riding experience. Miriam helped us build upon new skills and pushed us to do amazing things - not to mention she is very talented at taking video while in a full cantor! If she had not taken the pictures or video our friends would not believe we actually did the moves on these wonderful horses! Riding with no hands? Yep, and not just once! The horses, the experience, the ability to ride side-by-side and not on a trail, makes this experience so unique. The national park and it beautiful trees along with the new friends we have made with Adrian and Miriam makes this the best experience of our time in Argentina. When we return, this will be the first stop for us! Thank you Caballos A La Par!"

My friend was a beginner and I had ridden a bit years ago, but Adrian truly was a great teacher and picked horses that fit our needs.

As well as the riding itself the couple are extremely welcoming, inviting us into their lovely home for mate and empanadas. Finally, do not worry if your Spanish is not what it could (or should) be - their English is excellent.

I've ridden several times before over the years, but because it's private instruction, I felt challenged the whole time. It's a different experience being in the lead, rather than having the horse just following the horse in front of it, as is often the case on trail rides. Miriam had my camera phone and was taking pictures and videos the whole time. That's nice for souvenirs, and it was also a good learning tool, since I could get immediate feedback about what I looked like while riding. I think we were riding for 2 or 2.5 hours. Whatever it was, it was enough. (Honestly, I'm still a little sore now, a week later.) When we got back, we had empanadas for lunch, which were quite delicious. It was all a great experience, and I highly recommend it to anybody who things they would enjoy horseback riding."

If you are more experienced you will get an appropriate horse. This is not like in most stables were the horses all walk in one line after eachother. Each horse will listen to the instruction that you give and the energy you bring with you.We all had a wonderful day and an amazing horsebackriding experience. If you are in Buenos Aires and love horses, no matter what your level is go and check Caballos A La Par. I've been to many stables all over the world but this one is my favorite."

I was amazed to see the attention to detail that Adrian and Miriam put into their work to host, prepare, personally supervise and follow up for feedback. They strive for nothing short of excellence and take every step to make sure that your experience is memorable. The experience takes you through a personally escorted ride through a neighboring (beautiful) park. Miriam did a lot much to acquaint you with the horses, to build that partnership. I had personally not EVER ridden a horse, and I was galloping by the end of the ride. I owe this quick progression to the patient, studied and care that Adrian and Miriam put into our riding. Quite frankly, of all the many experiences that I have had in Buenos Aires, this is among the best. And, I would certainly put their commitment to excellence as truly world class."

We are so fortunate to spend the day with the horses and the even more amazing people that take care of them.The tour is private and truly amazing. This is the first time I (or my girlfriend) rode a horse, but we were shown the basics and felt very comfortable. We spent almost the whole day riding the horses and even though it was warm the ride was not very difficult. One of the most special parts of this day was when we got to help a little on the farm (not a common request). We helped clean the horses we rode and helped with a couple small things. This was fun and I think it showed us a little more than just riding the horses.We were picked up in downtown BA and driven to where the horses (farm) are. We were dropped off at the hotel on the way back. We were provided mate and lunch; both of which were fantastic!This was truly a special activity and we would absolutely recommend doing this again and if we are ever back we will do this again too!!"

Lastly for those who are planning on seeing BA and Argentina the country especially for Americans feels like its in a economic time warp and you end up feeling for the people. All I can say is that Argentina needs less corruption and more entrepreneurs like Miriam and Adrien and it will bounce back"

We were looking forward to riding horses whilst in BA but this experience as rewarding and memorable beyond all of our expectations.Adrian and Marian who own the establishment lead the rides and their passion for their horses and for teaching riders shines through the entire experience. They teach the gaucho style of riding and are excellent at bringing together all of the details to enable their riders to ride at a relatively advanced level in just a few hours. As a relatively inexperienced rider, I originally found it quite difficult to coordinate all of the subtlety of the positions and movements, but once it clicked it felt completely natural. It was also liberating as it was the first time I had ever felt completely comfortable on a horse.Our group contained experienced riders and beginners (one of our group had never sat on a horse before), but by the end of the day we were all cantering confidently. One of the experienced riders in the group said that it would typically take 4-5 sessions to achieve this level of competence. I get the feeling we could have had a very easy day out, but I we got the most out it because we were willing to challenge ourselves. The stables are on the edge of a national park about 30 minutes outside of BA but the team helpfully and happily dropped picked us up and dropped us off from a central location in BA. Adrian, Marianne and team are friendly and inspiring people and they clearly love what they do.If you\u2019re looking to ride in Buenos Aires or just looking for something new this should definitely be at the top of the list!"

Before I left for my trip, a friend told me that if I hadn't experienced Argentina from the back of a horse, I hadn't experienced it at all. I came across this place searching trip advisor and being quite impressed by the overwhelming amount of positive reviews. This many people couldn't be wrong - and they weren't. It truly didn't feel like your typical tourist riding experience, where horses follow a path that they do 20 times a day, seem unhappy and apathetic. This experience was worth every centavo, and felt rather like hanging out with friends than a business transaction. It was a nice, relaxing break from the city, hanging out on the farm, drinking Mate and eating Empanadas, while chatting with Miriam about her interesting life story. I used to horseback ride quite regularly when a kid, but hadn't been on a horse in years. I regained confidence quickly though, and Miriam truly adapted to my pace, slowly making me rediscover my love for riding again. I would recommend this place to anyone and will certainly be back if I ever make it to the area again."

I cannot speak highly enough of this experience - at first when I searched online I thought it might be out of my price range but I'm so happy that I decided to treat myself! It was very easy to organise via email, and Adrian arrived perfectly on time at the agreed pick up location - an easy drive outside of the bustle of the city the the beautiful parklands, it felt like we were a million miles away from the stress of the city. English is spoken for those who aren't confident speaking Spanish, safety equipment provided along with a lot of information shared in advance of the ride to ensure the best horse was selected for my ride. As somebody who grew up with horses I feel I learnt more in my hours riding with Caballos A La Par than in my lifetime - focusing on real horsemanship and how to communicate with your horse rather than a simple 'cabelgata' following round in a nose to tail formation. Cantering without reins, learning specific signals and correct posture were just part of the intensive lesson, alongside lots of fun exploring the parkland too. The ride is completely catered to your ability - I know they get a lot of beginner riders who all have just as much fun as those who have have been competing at competition level for many years. The horses are all looked after well, and are healthy and fit and very well trained to the Caballos A La Par style of riding. Not a bad word to say about this experience, I would do it every day if I could and it is great value for money - book in NOW!"

They asked me beforehand about my experiences, expectations and physical data to select the right horse for me. I was picked up in time in San Juan Avenue / Lima in Buenos Aires in front of the bar \"Playas del Carmen\". We drove some 30-40 minutes to the beautiful countryside outside of the city to the riding-stable of Caballos A La Par.They had selected Indio, their most experienced horse, for me as I had not had riding clases in some years and wasn\u00b4t sure how fit I was. I had no problems to ride Indio - he is very well-trained and patient. We did walk, trot, canter and many exercises like canter with free hands, sudden stops and double rounds.I have had many riding lessons in groups during past holidays. There the horses mostly ended up following each other instead of their riders\u00b4 commands. But this was a one on one riding lesson with just me, Indio, my riding teacher and his horse in the beautiful countryside. I realized Indio was really following my commands - at least when I gave them the right way - and not when I didn\u00b4t. This way I learned a lot in only 2,5 hourse. During the lesson my teacher would take fotos and videos of me on the horse so that I could see - and correct - my riding position and have beautiful memories of the day. Later we finished the day together with hot chocolate and pastries on the estate, before my riding teacher brought me back to Buenos Aires where I had been picked up. All transfers, food and beverages were included in the price. Unpayable was the hospitality, humor and the great conversations we had that day. - A wonderful experience!"

My friend and I have very very little horse riding experience. In fact our confidence was so low, we were debating whether to use a different company that catered more toward non-riders with horses that follow a well known trail and take directions from the cues of the leader. However, we made the right choice in selecting Caballos a la Par because Adrian and his method of teaching gives you the skills to actually ride a horse properly. When you ride with Adrian YOU are in control of your own horse. He teaches you exactly how to make your horse do what you want it to do. So you don't have to follow behind him. You can ride beside him, in front of him, wherever you want. My friend and I are both high school teachers and from a professional point of view Adrian's teaching method is top notch! He will push you to do things you never imagined you would do. Toward the end of the ride, he had us dropping the reins and cantering without holding on. As the title suggests we went from \"zero to hero\" in a few short hours and thats because of Adrian's effective teaching style. If you have no experience with horses, I promise you will walk away from this experience with the greatest sense of satisfaction and achievement. And if you can already ride a horse, this will be a great experience for you as well because the National Park is glorious, stunning and pristine."

My expectations were exceeded from the minute Adrian picked us up from the hotel. As far as hosts go, he was wonderful. We started the morning with Yerba Mate before we went out for the day, which in itself was a lovely experience. Before we went out Adrian promised that we wouldn't be \"sitting on the horse, we would be RIDING the horse\" and he definitely kept his promise. My horse Isabel (out of respect I hope I'm spelling that correctly) was wonderful to ride. This took me completely out of my comfort zone, but I never once felt unsafe. I loved Buenos Aires but this was probably the best thing I did while I was there. If you are looking for a tour that's completely unpersonalized with a large group, this is NOT the excursion for you. This was as intimate and personal as it gets and they are able to provide a much better experience with private lessons. I HIGHLY recommend Caballos A La Par. This is an experience you will not get with any other company. Worth every penny. ...Oh did I mention there were empanadas waiting for us when we were done. The magic words."

A friend told me enthousiasticly about his horseback driving experience at Caballos A La Par and I knew I wanted to go there.Me as well, I had a great experience driving in nature in this amazing huge forest reserve, on different grounds, through different landscapes and in the lovely company of Miriam who was teaching very efficiently. In Holland I have been taking classes for about eight months in the \"English style\" but with the instructions of Adrian and the corrections of Miriam during the ride, I was able to drive these Argentine horses. At the end of the ride we changed horses to practise control, which allowed me to experience two different horses. You can feel the horses are happy horses, they are outside all day long and are very sensitive.Miriam is so skilled she is able to shoot a lot of pictures and videos while driving and teaching. Very kind!"

It\u2019s not a conventional tour; this is a private riding lesson and you will learn a lot. My only previous experience was horseback riding tours, where you\u2019re more like a passenger on a horse that is following the horses in front. Not here! In no time at all, Adrian had me out riding around the beautiful grounds and learning different gaits and tricks. Adrian is a fantastic teacher. It\u2019s obvious he is passionate about horses and riding and he made learning really enjoyable. The \u201ca la par\u201d method forces you to lead your own horse. My horse Indio was very patient with me as a beginner and so much fun to ride. It was all very easy to set up and Hector picked me up from and dropped me off downtown. We drank some mate before the lesson and snacked on empanadas afterwards. A bonus: Adrian took pictures and videos on my phone while we were riding so I have proof of the lesson. Now I can show my family and friends that I can ride a horse! All in all, it was a great afternoon escape from the city. You will leave sore, but wanting to ride more."

I felt I got more out of my two hr ride with Adrian then I have with 1 yr worth of private lesson in london.Adrian has an wonderful energy and a real passion for horses and people. And I fisinhed my ride on a real high.when we got back there was food and a cold drinks and I was offered to go swimming in there shimming pool which I would have loved to do but needed to get back to the city.Adrian drove me back into town and waited until I was safely in a cab before he left.

The place is amazing, the horses are the most beautiful horses i ve ever seen in my life and Adrian and Miriam are both doing a great job taking care of everything. You start with a pick up either in the morning or in the afternoon from Buenos Aires - which was really easy for us because Adrian was truely punctual. The ride is about 45 mins from Buenos Aires and as soon as you arrive, you see all the horses, dogs, cats living in a harmony together, everything is green and very well taken care of, there is even a pool for hot summer days, if you d like a dip after the ride. Traditional mate drinking is followed by a 2.5-3 hrs long lesson! You can immediately tell how a great teacher Adrian is. He sees every detail and corrects you everytime you do something wrong! Believe me take one class with adrian and it is 4 classes worth in anywhere similar in Europe if not more!!At the end of the class, you will be able to walk and run and do circles on the horse- on your own! After the lesson, i had tasted the best Empanadas ever and had a chance to chat with both Adrian and Miriam- both so lovely and passionate about what they are doing. I have been living in Buenos Aires for almost 3 months now and i did almost every activity you could imagine. This is by far my favorite and i cant wait to come back to Caballos a la Par\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f thank you Adrian and Miriam for this experience!"

We were both beginners, but with Adrian's great coaching skills and patience, we quickly became very comfortable on the horses. Prior to our lesson, Adrian warmly welcomed us into his home and gave us some mate (traditional South American tea). He chatted with us about Argentina and the culture and told us why he loves teaching and working with horses. We immediately developed a bond with him, as he treated us like family. His father, who picked us up and dropped us off in Buenos Aires, was also a lovely man. After riding for a few hours, we had learned so much and were so happy with our progress. Before heading back to the city, Adrian and his father kindly offered us a tasty lunch of empanadas. We truly enjoyed the entire experience and would highly recommend this activity to anyone who loves animals and wants to see the countryside. The property is beautiful and the horses are so sweet and well groomed -- the owners take great care of them! Thanks as well to Miriam for helping us organize this great adventure!

The owner/accomplished equestrian and all around Renaissance man, spared no detail in getting me to conquer my fears. Adriane is a unique gentleman who loves his 15 horses and is passionate about sharing his joy with new comers to his extraordinary ranch and home. My adult daughter picked up everything very quickly; I, however, needed constant supervision. At no time did I feel endangered and Adriane made certain that his horses obeyed his strong but loving commands. It was an afternoon that we will never forget and a personal trump for me.

He rescues a lot of his horses from abuse and mistreatment and nurses them back to health. When we arrived at the stables, Miriam greeted us with warm hugs, Mate and pastries. When it was time to start riding, Adrian was patient and encouraging. I used to ride a lot as a child, but he certainly challenged me! It was so fun to learn the Argentinian way of riding. My boyfriend never had any riding instruction, and improved dramatically by the end. I loved riding in the park - so much open space and beautiful scenery. We were on horseback for over 2 hours (I'm still sore as I'm writing this!). When we got back to the stables, we had lunch and chatted some more. It's so apparent that both Miriam and Adrian love animals and enjoy sharing their life with visitors. I hope that we will be able to visit again soon!"

The house and stables are half an hour''s drive out of the city. Adrian picked us up at a pre-arranged rendez-vous in town and explained that we would be riding side by side with him through a national park of 24,000 acres. At the house he first introduced us to mate, explaining the significance of the 'mate ceremony', at the same time talking to us about his horses - putting us at our ease, since we are not experienced riders. He taught us the rudiments of handling the horses before we started, and then we began a wonderful afternoon's ride in beautiful countryside. After more than two hours' ride, during which time we gained confidence and skill thanks to Adrian's teaching, we returned to the house for a swim in the pool and tea and cakes. Miriam took us back to town after a truly wonderful day!"

When organizing my trip to Buenos Aires with my family I decided to include a typical Gaucho program, and based on previous review I selected the Caballos a la par. Adrian and Mirian, who run this business are amazing people and deserve all the good feedback which was already written about this tour. During 3 hours we ride 5 beautiful horses in a protected area very well kept, and with all the rustic style and local vegetation of the region. Even considering the few hours on top of the horses my children (9 and 11 years old) loved it, and for my biggest surprise, they were able to ride a horse very fast (galope), which was also a big surprise for Adrian. I strongly recommend this tour not only for the horse riding, but also to know this beautiful region of Buenos Aires, which is 40 minutes away from the city! My children still talk about this tour, and if you check the video of my boy riding a horse you will certainly understand why! Check it out: http://youtu.be/MbQFn3mq_kM.The command voice at the background is Adrian always correcting our posture and helping us to ride properly. :-)"

I was given an Argentine Criollo Horse called Indio to ride, and off we set into the very large parklands that Peron \"liberated\" from a private rancher.The style of riding I was taught involves almost no rein contact, just a forward movement of the hands to accelerate, and a backwards movement to stop. Before long, I found myself cantering with no hands at all, and minimal leg usage. By the end of the ride, using gentle neck reining, I successfully cantered between barrels.I cannot praise this experience highly enough.

Miriam was totally up for the challenge and I felt like I had learned so much by the end of the day. We spent lots of time laughing and getting to know each other, as well as bonding with our talented horses who were clam, alert and very responsive. I was even able to jump straight into their pool to cool down after my lesson before being driven back into the city. What service! I can't wait to go back to see them and ride on my next visit.

They arranged for a convenient pick up and drop off location not far from our hotel (and city center). Once we arrived, we were welcomed into their home and offered mate and pastries. We learned about riding techniques and they paired us with horses that met our skill level. They encouraged us to challenge ourselves but also remained patient with us. We rode through a beautiful national park and learned how to walk, trot and canter. My husband and I are both beginners but were really set at ease and felt comfortable under Miriam's and Adrian's instruction. They were both so pleasant and have such a respect and love for their horses. If you're looking for a unique experience and a quick getaway from the city, you must book them!"

I did have no horseback riding experience at all and my girlfriend only had a little. Nevertheless, Adrian is such a good teacher and the horses at \"Caballos A La Par\" are trained so well, two hours after our arrival we were riding the amazing park in which the hacienda is located. Side by side!! As mentioned on the Web-Site the horses do not just follow each other. You ride the horse.It really was worth it.But don't forget: Horse riding is a sport. I felt my muscles the next day, even though I did a lot of other sports for all my life."

They will cater to any level of rider, but I came in with an intermediate level of experience in Western style. \"A la par\" is not Western or English style. It's gaucho, and the switch was difficult for me, but Adrian was not going to let me go without getting it. He's a taskmaster who gives individual instruction, so it was not the relaxing, mindless kind of wandering in the countryside you might get elsewhere, but it was worth the work. The horses are so well trained, you know it's the rider who needs to adjust when things aren't right. If you're not up for the effort, you can stay back and play with the happiest dogs in the world, take a dip in the pool, drink mate, and wait for the empanadas to get there!"

We found this trip on TripAdvisor and were blown away by the favorable reviews. And guess what? They are 100% accurate.First of all, all of the logistics are built in. They arrange a pickup for you at a restaurant near the subway. They drive you in and out of town. They give you all of the training you need to be cantoring and trotting at decent speeds. It's really exhilarating! The horses are SO well behaved, as Adrian and Miriam are expert trainers. They also were very patient with our beginner's experience. It felt very customized for our skill level, whereas if we had had lots of experienc ethey could have given us an equally great experience.They don't rush you either. We were served mat\u00e9 to start and coffee/water at the end of the day. We were lucky to have brilliant weather, leaving us humbled and happy. We will 100% recommend this to all of our friends who come to Bs As, and cannot say enough nice things about Adrian and Miriam (and Hector, who picked us up in the city). I had so many moments on my ride where I thought \"Wow. This is the most beautiful sight.

I have to say the day with Adrian and Miriam was the best part of my trip to Argentina (without a doubt). I have had very little riding experience but Adrian takes the time to first talk to you, then pick one of his 16 horses that fits your needs and level. Even if you are a beginner, the horses are extremely well trained and you feel comfortable in the saddle. They teach the Argentinian style of riding and really push you to learn how to ride properly because they are truly passionate about all things equestrian. The park is large and diverse in scenery, the ranch a beautiful spot but it is really the people that makes this experience. It is so refreshing to meet people driven by their passion and not business. If you are looking for a truly unique activity, one in which you have to work but feel rewarded in the end, Caballos a la Par is the place for you. And so you know this is not a fake review... Only downside is I was a bit sore the next day BUT WELL WORTH IT!"

They also give you Instruction if you ask for it. The park is beautiful and even has a small bamboo jungle in it, the temperature was mild.

Later on, Adrien and I rode out to the ecological reserve nearby, passing a stream, a forest and beautiful grasslands.

Adrian and Miriam are both lovely and were so friendly and welcoming. I was asked about my riding experience so I could be matched with a horse suitable for my riding ability, and provided with a hat and chaps.Having ridden for most of my life in the UK, it was strange to ride Argentinian style, a completely different style of riding than I was used to. However, after some instructions from Adrian, I was off for a beautiful ride with Miriam, who carried on teaching and helping me thought the ride. We rode through the gorgeous Argentinian countryside, walk trotting and cantering, even cantering without reins. Caballos a la Par do not follow set rides or tracks, so you are able to ride wherever you choose. Miriam was great, and very knowledgable, she helped me improve my riding throughout the day. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Adrian and Miriam and would recommend it to anyone, whether an experience rider or a complete beginner. The horses are gorgeous, well looked after, well trained, and safe, and the riding is fantastic. I cannot wait to return to Argentina so I can visit them again. Go to Caballos a la Par, you will have a fantastic day and meet some lovely people and horses!"

By that time we already felt disconnected from rushy Buenos Aires and just enjoyed the nature. My boyfriend and me have different Levels of expertise on horses but Adrian gave us excellent recommendations on how to improve our riding skills. We felt super comfortable on our horses Indio and Lindo. You can really feel the passion of Adrian (and his son and team :)) for the horses.

I have travelled the world extensively and must admit that this is the first experience that convinced me of registering with trip advisor and write a review. Blessed to have lived in several countries of Europe, Latin America and Asia and a great hunger for traveling the world, I can say that I am very spoiled when it comes to rating value-for-money experiences. My girlfriend and me have spent a full day at the outskirts of Buenos Aires at this beautiful place and both improved our horse riding skills by far due to the individual advice provided by Adrian. It started with a uncomplicated communication and perfect organization by Miriam, a friendly pickup by H\u00e9ctor (even though being 40 minutes late to the pick up point due to traffic and other reasons) and a warm welcome at the ranch. Adrian explained the art of drinking Mate while discussing our riding skills (mine equaled more or less none, my girlfriends were advanced) and after some rounds of revitalizing \"hierba\" we were already introduced to our horses and were doing the first rounds on the premises. Both our horses Lindo (the handsome) and Indio (selfexplanatory :-) ) were trained excellent and very, very calm - this stayed like that the whole trip. No rushing home, no following each other, no lazyness...nothing! - impeccably trained, friendly and chilled horses!We lasted for rough three hours and were absolutely done. Adrian pushed us through the exercises in a very professional way and improved our skills by far - we had to ask to stop due to being totally exhausted. Back a the stalls we still were allowed to train some basic moves, provided soft drinks and then taken back to Buenos Aires. This is by far the best horse riding experience in general, but specially when thinking about the value for money. I thank both Miriam and Adrian, but also the horses and the rest of the staff for this great day. Definitely one to recommend!RegardsRichard"

I heard of Caballos A La Par through a mutual friend when I had inquired about finding \"a great, horse riding experience where I'd actually learn something and get to run horses, that wasn't too far from the city.\" So many times I've gone to a touristy-type stable and was trotted out with a group of city slickers, only to become bored 30 mins with the trip and annoyed with the scenery on repeat. This is not the case with CALP. The testimony of my friend was on point that day, but she far undersold it in my opinion. On 2.5 hour trip out that day with my best friends in tow (they only take private groups or personal trips,) we discovered so much more than just \"a fun time on some horses,\" but instead we each received an intimate, specific instruction on our form with constant correction; how to connect and transmit energy to lead the horse personally assigned to us (Adrian is like the horse whisperer!); how to canter without hands!; and understanding the environment you navigate (ducking branches is tricky...) and why working with people who are passionate and in love with their profession can inspire you to live the life you want to live. It's not just about riding a horse. It's about learning about your limits, conquering a skill you didn't think you had and respecting nature and all its glory. In addition to Adrian and Miriam being so amazing as guides and hosts, they also allow the well fed, clean horses to free roam most of the day at their lovely, spacious compound; they have a spotless stable that smells more of fine leather saddles instead of manure; and have amenities offered like a playground for kids, cats and dogs to play with and a giant swimming pool to cool off in after a hard ride. I just came back from my 2nd trip out with another friend who was visiting from NYC, and she hasn't stopped talking about it. I am here for a bit longer, and I'm definitely going to return on a frequent basis. Apparently, my galloping / stopping lesson is next! Whoooo hoooo!

They really love and believe in what they are doing and really care about their horses and about your objectives and learning.We were picked up from BA and, on arrival, sat round the kitchen table, chatting and drinking mat\u00e9 (carefully concocted by Adrian) for best part of an hour before heading out. The horse you ride is carefully selected by Adrian and Miriam to suit your ability (which has been discussed over mat\u00e9). I rode a lovely grey Criollo cross with a very soft mouth and smooth gait.I was taught by Adrian who grew up in the area, is a former gaucho, polo player and self-taught showjumper and now competes in certain gaucho reining games and also endurance events on the beautiful Arab horses that they have. It was very interesting to talk to him about how he came to be involved in all the different disciplines.The national park in which you ride is lush and beautiful with wooded areas, streams, long grasses and wild flowers (my visit was in early spring) and became all the more beautiful as we returned to the stables in the soft setting sunlight. Adrian used a mixture of teaching techniques: not giving you too many things to focus on at once. I was keen to improve my cantering technique in particular and he videoed me on my camera so that I could see what I was doing which was extremely valuable.I had originally thought it seemed like an expensive outing but for the 1:1 attention you receive and for the quality of the horses, teaching and beautiful nature, it is 100% value for money. It might be a helpful thing to do to gain confidence in the saddle before staying on an estancia elsewhere in Argentina where the gauchos are unlikely to give you tips on technique."

The first day I visited I rode one-on-one with Adrian, who is a first-rate instructor. His observations and directions were excellent; I feel I gained so much from our one lesson. While I was only planning on the one visit I decided to fit an extra in. The second time I rode with Miriam, who is also an amazing instructor and fascinating person.

After I was introduced to Miriam and the horses, Adrian and I started our trip with drinking mate tea and talking about horses and what kind of experiences I've already made on a horseback. But even if you don't have any experience at all, Adrian and Miriam will take care of you! I felt so comfortable being there and couldn't wait to get on a horseback!!! I went on a trip with Adrian. After giving me a few instructions we were ready to leave. One of the most amazing things is, that you are right the middle of a national park which is called \"Parque Pereyra Iraola\". This park is just wonderful!!! I've been horse back riding for so many years but this experience was so unique!!!! I enjoyed every single minute on my trip with \"Caballos A La Par\". After a few hours, Adrian and I returned to the stable and there was Miriam , waiting for us with a surprise.I'm not gonna tell you what it is, but just let me say it was the best possible way to finish such an amazing day.I promised myself to go back and visit Adrian and Miriam again!!!! I will never forget this experience, it was so unique and wonderful!!! A special place to go.If you want to enjoy Argentina on a horseback, then \"Caballos A La Par\" it is!!!!Go and convince yourself. It is worth it!!!!!I will definitely come back and enjoy it again!!!!"

I had the opportunity to ride, on a private trip with Adrian (the instructor) on two very well trained horses, Indio and Shake. Both horses were fantastic to ride in a beautiful, wild infinite landscape. It is a paradise!Since the moment you get there, before the excursion begins, Adrian and Miriam welcome you and make you feel like home, with delicious traditional Argentinean cakes and its national drink, called \u2018mate\u2019. Both of them are adorable, very attentive, and speak perfectly English! Before riding, they will assign you the horse that best suits your level. The horses there are amazing in all terms. They are very well trained and treated with a lot of love and consideration, they transmit them a lot of passion and respect. Since the moment I started riding, Adrian made me feel very comfortable on the horse, he is a fantastic instructor who brings out the best of everyone while riding, no matter what level you have! I had the chance to walk, trot and gallop through the beautiful fields with two different horses (Indio and Shake) while Adrian kept improving my techniques and posture. And as well, he offered himself to take me fantastic photos and videos of me while galloping! It was great! I have honestly been riding for a few years, and this has been one of my best experiences on a horse. I have no doubt that no matter what your level is, you will live an amazing and unforgettable time while horseback riding. As soon as I am back to Buenos Aires, I will certainly repeat this wonderful experience.PS. The offer you transportation from Buenos Aires center!"

Miriam and Adrian are amazing hosts and provide what I believe is the best experience in BA. Whether you have no experience of lots of experience riding horses, they have a horse that will be perfect for you. If you want to be challenged, they can help with that too. Aside from the horses, the rest of the day is great too. When you show up, Adrian whips up one of the best Mates in Argentina. After your mate, you get to escape to an amazing park, where you get to roam free. You walk, trot, and canter - it is truly an amazing ride. After the ride, if you go on the weekend, eat the best empanada in Argentina. The experience at Caballos a La Par was so great, I went back for a second ride. Next time I am in BA, it will definitely be one of my first stops. There is no better way to escape the concrete jungle for a morning or an afternoon than Caballos a La Par!"

Within short time, Adrian had me riding fast (as least to my impression) and in control of the horse with one hand and in one case hands free. Being a rookie, I was surprised how responsive the horses were to your guidance and direction. The horses are very well trained. Everything was very pleasant, the pickup, the introduction with mate-tea, the surrounding, the horses, the staff. I was a bit proud of my accomplishment that I have been showing around some of the video and photos Adrian took (and calling myself by my rider alias El Tronador). And of course I had to have a polo-shirt. You should try it. You will feel great."

But since I love horses, I had to check this one out after reading all the reviews. My horseback riding experiences were mostly in SEA and they were very disappointing since the horses simply follow the trail or other horses or the owner.First of all, I contacted them through their website. Miriam was very prompt in replying to emails and answered all my questions regarding the tour cost, pick up time and location, and so on.When we got to the park, she brewed some mate and showed us the way to drink mate and asked us about our experience with horses. Adrian and Miriam decided which horses would suit us.You can tell they really care about their horses and love what they do. Miriam was our teacher and she was very patient with us. The horses are really healthy and very well trained. When we were \"walking\" through the park, we asked her which way we should go and she said just take your horse and roam free. If you've done other horseback riding tours before, you don't ever get to roam free.By the end of the day, we were able to walk and canter with the horses and sit somewhat properly. Since we are beginners and it was hard for us (well, more for me) to sit with curved back and heels downward. (Kept yelling at myself \"Heels, Down!\") This tour is not for a big group, they prefer to have 2-3 people in a group.They have two trips a day, one at 10am and second one at 2pm. Each trip takes about 3-4 hours.After we got back, Miriam made us amazingly decadent hot chocolate (submarinos) and served it with Argentinian pastries.As backpackers, we are all about saving money but I can honestly say it was worth every penny and especially if you are beginners, you get to learn how to ride a horse."

As the training is provided in private group so Adrian and Miriam would personalise the training depending on your own level and experience in horse-riding. After 2.5-hour ride we were back to the house and Adrian and Miriam served us with a lot of scrumptious pastries and Mate!

After inviting us to their little guesthouse and serving us Matte, we went to see the farm's horses. My brother and I are riders, and we were very impressed with their shape and fitness level.. There were a variety of breeds, Arabian, local, mixed and many more each with an interesting story and an interesting name! The riding experience was like no other, in the great plain fields of the suburb of Buenos Aires I was riding Indio.. the ride was unbelievably smooth, the beautiful brown horse was well trained, and needed no more than a light gesture to canter or change direction.. Adrian recommended a few exercises and tricks which made us enjoy the ride even better.. Another thing that I personally liked is the fact that Adrian was documenting every minute of our riding experience with our mobile phones, he recorded videos and captured amazing pictures of me and my brother throughout our journey (mom was very pleased when she saw them afterwards) After the ride, Miriam prepared some Argentinean style hot chocolate, which was of course delicious, and we enjoyed our hot drink with some incredible sweets fresh from the bakery! We had various conversations, and we felt a true connection to Adrian, Miriam, the horses, and the farm. We didn't want to leave..

After a few hours of riding we were more than ready for the pastries and hot chocolate waiting for us back at the stables. I could not recommend Caballos a la Par more highly.

For anyone looking to escape the congestion and noise of the city and feel more \"at home\" rather than being a tourist I can't think of a better activity. The park and the stables are just far enough from the city to feel like a different country but still be convenient for a half day. The animals are well cared for and our two horses adjusted rapidly to being ridden by visitors with almost no experience. Before and during the ride, Adrian took the time to talk to us about our experience and expectations and matched up horse and rider, putting us at ease and always making sure we were comfortable and secure while pushing us to improve and achieve more. The one on one approach (Adrian and Miriam never mix groups) keeps the focus riding without competition which makes for a relaxed atmosphere. Throughout the day, Adrian's passion for the horses and for riding is clear and heartfelt as is his interest in his guests experience. I can strongly recommend Caballos A La Par for anyone that has an interest in riding (not just sitting on a horse but wanting to learn to work in partnership with a horse) and wants to have an authentic personal experience in Buenos Aires."

I have my own horse at home and wanted to squeeze in a ride I had a private ride with Adrian, who showed me how to ride in the local style and we hacked out for the afternoon on a Criollo and an Arab, which I rode English style. The horses we're beautifully schooled and so responsive, which was perfect for me. We had a fabulous ride for around three hours in the National park which was so blissful after a hectic time in BA. Adrian made me feel welcome and I relaxed easily into the way of riding there, I could have stayed for much longer but had to leave for the evening in BA. I would absolutely 100% recommend this place. The horsemanship and quality of the horses far exceeded my expectations for BA and indeed was better than many places I've ridden overseas and at home. It was fabulous and I felt very happy there."

Adrian arranged to pick me up in town and drove me out to their property where I met Miriam who welcomed us with morning tea. Everything was very well organised and after some safety tips and preparation, Adrian and I headed out into the nearby national park. It was fabulous. Adrian challenged me all the way The horses are very well trained and once my horse was receiving the correct signals (with Adrian's advice) we were away. The park is beautiful and unspoilt. It was just wonderful to be able to ride with freedom and with no one about. We had a good long ride and on return had a light lunch with Miriam. Then Adrian brought me back to BA. All in all a great experience and I take my hat off to them for the effort they have made to make the experience unique. I am looking forward to going again next time I return"

From first contact before we left home to the end of our day with them we experienced excellent communication. It was everything we expected and more. We shared the traditional Mate ceremony before our ride. The facility is clean, equipment excellent and safety helmets provided. The horses are very well trained, safe, and responsive. We were matched with horses that met our experience levels. After 2 hours of riding my husband, who is a novice, was cantering with no reins in this beautiful UNESCO National Park. And Mariam did a great job taking pictures and video on our phones so we have the memories forever!"

On the drive home, Adrian told us that he and Miriam simply have a passion for both horses and teaching. He didn't need to tell us- their passion is truly evident throughout the whole experience. You are absolutely not allowed to feel like a stranger at their stables, as they couldn't be more personable or welcoming hosts. The private lessons allow for a lot of teaching time, which meant we became fairly capable very quickly. We were both total beginners going in, but by the end of the day we were comfortable in the saddle (though we paid for it the next day, as three or four hours of riding for beginners meant some sore muscles for us!). The horses are lovely, and are chosen to match your skill and personality. The park that we rode through is truly beautiful, though there are a lot of mosquitoes, so apply a generous amount of bug spray before going in! The experience was relaxing and instructive, and we didn't feel rushed at all. We will gladly recommend this to anyone we know going to BA, and we would love to go back if we ever find ourselves in BA again!"

The day before I had booked the polo day experience which did not live up to my expectations. Given the opportunity of doing this or the polo then I would opt for this above anything else.Miriam and Adrian were absolutely fantastic hosts who have a Real Passion for what they do. It was an absolute pleasure to spend time with them. I have been on horses before and later this same holiday also went on an Estancia horse riding tour, but as pointed out correctly by Adrian this is not horse riding, as one is guided by the horse on their usual route from a to b. Where as Adrian and Miriam take you from being a beginner to feeling like one can actually ride a horse, trotting, cantering after only an hour into our journey through a beautiful national park on a route you choose riding side by side with either Miriam or Adrian. Eagle eye Miriam can have an interesting conversation with you, then gently remind you about how you need to hold the reigns, arrange your posture etc this enables you to stop creating bad habits before they start.The empanadas and the mate were the best I have ever tried. Watching Adrian's children bareback on the horses was a real pleasure as you can see how the love of horses permeates through the whole family.Such wonderful people and a memorable experience that I will always remember. If I ever go back to BA this is the first thing I will do on my return. There is no hype, this is No1 because it is No1.Thank you again. I wish you all the very best in the future.Kerry"

From the first email contact to being dropped back in Buenos Aires in the afternoon, I was impressed by the efficiency and enthusiasm of the Caballos A La Par duo. Adrian and Miriam love their horses and their lifestyle and want to share this with anyone with a similar passion for horses, riding or a desire to learn to ride. During my ride I felt like I really learnt a lot and loved every minute of that. Adrian was a great coach and his love of riding is incredibly infectious. I've done quite a bit of holiday riding (but am definitely no expert at all having had very few lessons) and am regularly a little disappointed about the lack of individuality from the guides. However, my expectations were far exceeded here and I felt like I had a very tailored ride that was suited to me and my abilities... and no clock watching either!

I rode a lot and helped out at local stables in my teens (basically I was obsessed with horses) I still ride a few times a year so I was really looking forward to riding in Argentina. I rode in a few places and this was by far my favourite place to go horse riding.Situated half not far from BA. The horses were beautiful and very well kept. You also get to enjoy the presence of dogs and cats. Miriam and Adrian who run the stables and train the horses (most of which for competition) were super friendly and passionate about what they do. They take the time to assess your level when deciding which horse you should ride. Some of their horses are brillant for beginners as well as being great fun for experienced riders. Indeed the horses are sensitive to who they have on their back and adapt to their riders' skills.The stables are located next to this really nice and huge park. You will get to ride through lots of different sceneries (Fields, woods, leafy areas).I had a really great time riding there and it made me realise how much I missed riding on a regular basis. The horses were interesting to ride, the scenery superbe and I felt safe. You will be able enjoy a nice easy ride but also work on your riding skills and if you've never ridden western style the staff will ease you into the stume/I really recommend Caballos A La Par to any horse lover be they experienced riders or beginners. Going riding there was one of the highlights of my stay. Marjorie (France)"

The focus is on spending time on the horse with a good degree of instruction/guidance so if you are looking and want to improve upon your existing riding experience as well as have a half day of actual riding time this is ideal. Not the typical follow my leader experience although there is some trail riding most of the riding is done in expansive open areas, the scenery in the National Park is fantastic. I felt that I had improved significantly from stepping on the horse to getting back. Felt very natural to let go of the reins and canter hands free. This is the most comfortable and pain free that I have felt on a horse, they use custom made saddles and it clearly makes a difference. Adrian and Miriam the owners are very warm and open people and you are made to feel welcome straight away. The day started with Mate around the kitchen table and ended there with some fantastic empanadas. Highly recommended!"

I visited their beautiful facility which borders a 24,000 acre UNESCO park where we walked, trot, and cantered to our hearts content. I am a more experienced rider but my partner is a beginner and neither of us felt either hindered or pressured to do more less or more than we felt we were capable of. In fact, it's the first place I've been where I was a) allowed to canter wherever I wanted solo and b) where I seen any beginner that has learned how to canter successfully by the end of the day. Adrian joined us later in our outing and took my partner to the side and really got him to be aware of the horse's movements to the point where he felt like he really learned how to control the horse and got a good sense of how to hold his body/position. And Miriam definitely schooled me on my out of practice position, though try as she might I was still sore for days from an exhilarating day of riding! I would move there in a heartbeat to work for them if they'd have me!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED activity in Buenos Aires."

The method seems to have worked -- by the end of the day, I felt very comfortable on my horse and I was able to canter with no hands. Adrian and Miriam made me feel like a guest rather than a customer. We enjoyed mate prior to the ride, and then had a nice, relaxed homemade lunch afterward. Both provided interesting conversation that helped me to learn about life in Argentina, both in the eyes of an Argentine and an expat living there.Overall, this was a very enjoyable experience, and I left feeling as if I had accomplished something while on holiday!"

We rode with Adrian and Miriam and couple of days ago and it's difficult to describe how wonderful the overall experience was but I'll try! From the start, Miriam was extremely responsive in her communications on email and clear with instructions and what was required. Our pickup from downtown Buenos Aires was right on time and we whizzed to the location in about 1/2 hour. Our time with Adrian and Miriam started with MATE! This was Adrian's special brew of mate with his \"secret\" ingredient which I won't give away! Warm and friendly conversation all around that put us at ease. My wife and I rode with Adrian. This was personalised instruction and attention to the level I've never experienced. Adrian is clearly an experienced instructor who can teach all levels...beginners to advanced riders. My wife and I started gingerly and covered basics such as walking, turning, instructions and then onto trotting and cantering! By the end of the 3 hours, we were cantering without hands on the horses - all under Adrian's watchful eyes and clear directions of course! I learned more proper technique from Adrian than I ever did with previous instructors! Adrian also helped Ing and I take some fabulous videos and photos on our camera during our ride- be warned, bring a small, point and shoot camera Adrian can shoot with using one hand as he's riding on a horse beside you when he's doing so. Your big DSLR will not work....We rode in perfect weather...through beautiful changing grasslands. We ended the day with a cup of hot tea and pastries. I will not change a thing...we had a beautiful time and great experience with Caballos A La Par and riding with them again is top our list when we return to Buenos Aires! I should end with one more thing...their care and love for the horses was clearly evident by how well they kept the horses and the relationship they have with them. Beautiful, well trained horses in great condition. Just wonderful."

Frankly, I was nervous at the thought of the difference in ability and worried I would hold the rest of the group up. This was not the case. The horses are so incredibly well trained that even a complete novice can move at a decent pace. This coupled with the huge expanse of countryside we went riding in meant the more experienced riders could move about freely whilst the guide gave me excellent instruction, thus keeping everyone happy. It's worth stressing that at no point were we just following the horse in front at a trot. We were give free 'reign' (there had to be one pun) to go at our own pace. Miriam was a superb host, keeping the conversation flowing, instructing us whilst riding and even taking photos on our camera from the saddle. In short;- impeccably trained horses- 3ish hours of riding - the perfect amount; not so long that it got boring or too tiring but adequate to get to grips with your horse and feel like you've got your moneys worth- not your average 'follow the horse in front' riding experience - excellent host- beautiful countryside only a short distance from BA; and - decent empanada lunch. This was the highlight of my 10 days in BA, hands down. Thank you Miriam."

After agreeing on a date, Miriam gave us a location to meet where they would pick us up and take us out to their stables. They were prompt, friendly, and all smiles from the beginning to the end of our experience with them!Of the 7 of us, there was only one experienced rider, and by the end of the day EVERY SINGLE PERSON was cantering with no hands! They are a no nonsense, hands on, immersive riding lesson through a gorgeous 10,000 hectare reserve with responsive and well trained horses. Most riding experiences consist of sitting on a horse as they walk down a trail..not here! You literally get a four hour riding lesson that people generally pay hundreds of dollars for back in the states!Adrian begins the day by sharing \"mat\u00e9\" (a traditional South American tea) with each rider, using history and the prospects of the day to come to open up conversation--and to get to know his riders a little better, to pair each personality with a suitable horse. After riding, everyone came back to the house to have hot chocolate or beer (or both!) along with some amazing pastries before reluctantly returning to the ship and going back to our everyday lives.Miriam and Adrian -- THANK YOU!!!Great for groups of 2-10, everyone gets individualized as well as group instruction."

Even with no experience, my 9 year old daughter and I were in full control of our horses - walking, trotting, cantering through the meadows and along the trails. It was a perfect day - with warm and friendly hosts and well-trained horses. We would highly recommend this for individuals and families interested in a fun day of real, authentic Argentine horseback riding - at any skill level."

The ranch and countryside are stunning, the trainers are warm and encouraging, and the horses are extremely well trained (not to mention beautiful). I am a beginner rider and by the end of the ride I felt comfortable trotting and cantering (something I never thought I would be able to do). It is very clear that Miriam and Adrian are devoted to their horses and this company. I loved every moment of this experience and highly recommend Miriam and Adrian to others visiting Buenos Aires!"

None of this nose to tail, spend most of the time watching the trainer help others - this is a one on one country ride where the trainer (Miriam) kindly provides observations and tips to help improve ones riding abilities. All the horses (and they have several) are well mannered, well trained and comfortable. The equipment is in excellent condition and there is a serious attention to safety. Based on what I've seen, they can accomodate the most accomplished rider to the 'never been on a horse' rider - and each will have a wonderful time because the ride is tailored to the guest. The country is beautiful as well. I'm going back!"

            "review": "Great ride for experienced riders!. I went horseback riding at Caballos A la Par this past November (2013). I am an experienced English-style rider (rode 2-6 days a week for 9 years and competed in Big Eq. division in high school). Since high school, I have been riding about once a month on average for the last 14 years. The Caballos a la Par lesson suited my needs perfectly. First, Adrian and I had an extensive conversation about my riding experience and how people ride in Argentina on the way from Buenos Aires to the stable and over Yerba Mate (delicious!) once we got there. Once Adrian and Mariam selected an appropriate horse for me, I did some practice gait changes and turns to make sure I was comfortable and that the horse and I got along. Then Adrian really let me ride. Unlike a typical trail ride, he did not try to force me and my husband, who have very different levels of experience, to ride at the same pace the whole time, or to ride completely separately. We spent some time walking and trotting and talking side by side, but for most of the lesson, I was completely free to get my legs back, and then have fun galloping through fields and practicing hairpin turns, while Adrian went over basics with my husband. I usually horseback ride on vacation whenever possible (and I'm usually disappointed), and I can truly say that this is the first time I went with an inexperienced rider, and we got to ride together yet we both felt safe and challenged. And Adrian was such an effective teacher that, by the end of the afternoon, I was cantering side by side with my husband, a first time rider! Most importantly, all of the horses were beautiful, well-cared for, and responsive to riders' commands, and the stables and facilities were impeccably clean. I highly recommend Caballos a la Par for experienced riders looking for an excursion from Buenos Aires that is completely focused on the quality of the riding experience. The lesson and horses were appropriate and enjoyable whether you are going with other experienced riders or with a mixed group. And, if you are experienced but rusty, don\u2019t worry about getting pigeon-holed by your demo performance. Once we had been out for a while and I had gotten my legs back (and, in my husband\u2019s case, the basics down) we all switched horses for even more of a challenge. I should also note, the park was beautiful, and had all the scenic pleasures of a vacation trail ride without the typical frustrations (like lack of riding!). I highly recommend Caballos a la Par\u2026. You will not regret it!!!! (Side note: I'm not checking \"food available for purchase\" in the review because Adrian and Mariam provided sandwiches after the ride--no additional charge. This was in addition to the yerba mate and light biscuits before the ride.)"

We were two girls who had never been on a horse before and by the end of the day we were galloping without holding the reins! Miriam and Adrian are so good at making you feel safe and comfortable. The horses (mine was Isabel, the best!) is also amazing. So well trained, and you can feel that they are happy horses. This is not a touristy horse show on the pampas, this is the real thing. You feel like home at Caballos. Also, Adrian serves you real mate and local empanadas. At the end of the day you can have a refreshing swim in the pool. What a lovely getaway from the busy city!"

Miriam and Adrian at Caballos A La Par are the highly skilled, warm and enthusiastic owners and instructors at this beautiful riding school. These people build their business from the heart with a genuine wish to teach, and they will make you feel at home in 5 minutes!This is not a riding tour on a fixed trail, where you just need to sit on the horse doing nothing. You will not learn to BE ON a horse - you will learn how to RIDE the horse! So put on your long pants and enjoy a wonderful experience in a beautiful park / forest! You will have your own private instructor the whole time and you will be amazed how much you can learn in a few hours! You will be riding on your own from the very beginning - and you will feel capable of doing it. This was only my second time riding (first time in the Norway on fixed trail and with no instruction) and I left Caballos A La Par capable of riding alone in different styles and paces. I was over the moon about this experience and felt I just have to be a gaucho some day! Or at least come back to this place for a week or two :o)Just two peaces of advice: Plan for relaxing activity the next day - you will be sore, since you will actually be riding the horse. And don't bring someone (not even your hot fianc\u00e9), who don't really want to ride. Let them go do something just as great for them instead. This is too precious to let anything limit your joy!"

One of my favourite activities when I lived in Buenos Aires in 08/09 was horseback riding with Adrian and the Caballos a la Par team: beautiful horses; enjoying the outdoors; amazing connection Adrian has with the horses through which he is able to teach you something new or help you improve on your skills - whether you are beginner or advanced level; the fun and hospitality. I remember that during my last week end before moving, I organized a horseback ride with some 20 friends. It was simply an unforgettable afternoon. What impressed me most was seeing my friend -who was afraid of horses- galloping at ease and with a huge smile on her face thanks to Adrian\u2019s horse-magic.When I returned two weeks ago to Buenos Aires I definitely had a horse ride on my mind for the week end with Caballos a la Par. To be honest: I was a bit disappointed to learn that we would be going out riding with Adrian\u2019s new business partner Miriam instead of himself that day. However, that feeling was washed away within a few moments as Miriam seems to have the same gift that Adrian has. It was simply magical again with the familiar lush greens, the beautiful horses, enjoying and learning with the horses during the ride, the hospitality that Miriam showed us, as well as Adrian and his beautiful family, the team at the stables and the fun we had together. Simply unforgettable, still and again."

Miriam was very responsive via email days before our booking since we didn't have a cellphone that worked during our time there. Adrian was very punctual and picked us up the morning of the ride and we had a great conversation on the way down to their land, we didn't speak much Spanish but his English was great.The experience from start to finish was great, I've ridden horses several times before but my wife had not. Adrian knows how to read the horses body language as well as ours, and was able to teach us and push us to get better in such a short period of time. Most other tours allow you to walk in a line only, maybe trot towards the end. Adrian taught us how to walk, trot, and cantor including how to maintain the proper posture and communicate with the horses. It was so much fun cantoring throughout the forest reserve freely without much restriction. Adrian's passion is teaching, so make sure you are want to listen and get better!We enjoyed also the mate before and empanadas afterward. I'd recommend this trip to anyone who wants to learn, improve, or perfect their horseback riding... And for those who want to push themselves to the limits! We are recommending them to our other friends (also in their early 30's) who are visiting BA later this year."

I contacted Caballos A La Par, because I thought it would be nice to get out on a horse (although I am a beginner). Miriam wrote me back promptly and we had plans to be out in the following days. She picked me up in Buenos Aires (in a very easy location to find) and drove me out to the stables. It wasn't at all what I expected, nearly 100000 times better. She didn't have me learning in a typical arena, but out in the opens fields of a wonderful UNESCO reserve. I thought I wouldn't be as comfortable on a horse as I was, but I immediately felt safe on Indio (the horse), as he and Miriam both have many years experience. We had a few nice hours out in the fields, then came back to the barn/stables for some wonderful (possibly the best I have had in Argentina) empanadas from a local woman. Miriam felt more like a friend than a tourist instructor, she even introduced me to the Argentinean Mate! I would recommend this trip to anyone (and I plan on going back for some repeat lessons)."

            "review": "\"Wonderful and unique riding and learning experience\". My husband and I always enjoy going horseback riding when we travel internationally (both of us are beginners). We saw the excellent reviews for Caballos A La Par and knew we had to try it. After we emailed for information about available times, Miriam quickly responded. Our adventure started with Miriam picking us up at a convenient meeting point in BA at 3 pm. Miriam was very punctual, which my husband and I both appreciated. This was the first time we had ventured out of Buenos Aires, and the scenery was beautiful. Adrian was waiting for us when we arrived, and we went inside to chat. Miriam and Adrian told us about themselves and provided some history of the stables and horses. It was evident right away how much they both love the horses and consider each one of the 13 horses as a family member. Though we are comfortable with the basics of horseback riding, we had no idea truly how to ride as none of the other places where we had ridden horses in the past ever took the time to teach us the correct way. The other places where we rode (Aruba, Jamaica, South Africa, and Hawaii) typically had horses that followed one another, and though fun, typically resembled more of a Disney ride than a true horse riding experience. After discussing with Adrian and Miriam, we quickly came to realize this was a different type of experience, which is why this is constantly rated as the top activity in Buenos Aires.Before beginning, we received very detailed instructions on the proper riding position and how to properly tell the horse where to go and at the desired pace. Adrian then selected Indio for me to ride and Isabel for my husband. Miriam rode Bandito. Both were on the smaller side with very gentle demeanors. Adrian chose those horses for us because we are beginners. However, if you are an experienced rider or have trained in equestrian events, then Adrian, who himself has competed in and won many equestrian events, has horses that can jump and can provide a challenge to even the most experienced riders. Once our ride started, Miriam watched us extremely closely to ensure our riding form was proper and instruct us where appropriate. The horses are very well behaved and make you feel relaxed. We then left their beautiful property and traveled across the road to a lovely state park where we rode for a little over 3 hours. The park had so many great trails for riding. While we were riding all over the place and doing so with the proper balance and technique, Miriam would take pictures so we can remember the ride. The park\u2019s landscape is very peaceful and diverse. There are many wooded areas to go through and open space where you are able to trot and canter. Miriam started us with fast walking and then we worked our way up to trotting and cantering on our own. It was so exciting because my husband and I were in control of the horse and most importantly truly felt comfortable on top of the horse. As I noted earlier, we had been horseback riding before in other countries, but those trips were more Disneyesque in that there was a set trail and even if you did something wrong the horse knew where he was supposed to go so we truly weren\u2019t doing anything except staying on the horse\u2014much like a Disney ride. That is not the case here, as Adrian and Miriam truly want you to leave understanding how to ride and direct a horse and want you to be able to feel comfortable on a horse when you ride again. This is the magic that truly sets this experience apart from the other riding experiences that we had been on. Beyond the lengthy park ride, we received non-stop individualized instruction and coaching by the highly experienced Miriam and Adrian. At the end of the ride, my husband and I got to feed our now tired horses carrots and see the other 11 horses that are being cared for in the stables. After the great ride and feeding the horses, Miriam fixed us hot chocolate and we enjoyed very tasty pastries. Miriam also took some excellent photos for us while giving us instruction and riding at the same time. Adrian drove us back to our hotel, and we arrived around 10:30 pm. The price for the park riding adventure is the bargain of a lifetime when you consider round-trip pick-up and drop-off and the hours of riding and instruction. In fact, the amount was extremely reasonable per person, but if you consider that my husband and I were the only riders, that Adrian and Miriam provided these beautiful horses to ride in the wonderful park setting with hours of personalized riding instruction throughout, and that they spent 7.5 hours with us from pick-up to drop-off, then they are only making a small amount an hour and are taking care of 13 horses and many other animals, including dogs and a then pregnant cat, at their farm. We are going to return to Argentina in the future and will definitely ride again at Caballos A La Par again. After spending the day with Adrian and Miriam, my husband and I both now feel comfortable on a horse and can actually ride. More importantly, we felt we had made new friends. What a wonderful experience that we highly recommend to anyone!"

We came to Argentina from the United States (New Hampshire), and knew we wanted to go riding a couple of times. We found Caballos A La Par online on Trip Advisor - thankfully - while we were in Buenos Aires, and it was a last minute decision. We booked easily with Miriam, got picked up in B. As. and were on our way on a short drive to the ranch. Everything about Caballos A La Par is warm, friendly and inviting. But then we started our ride. It was NOT a typical follow-the-leader ride... it was a professional riding lesson while enjoying our ride. I cannot say enough about how much time and energy that Adrian and Miriam put into our family on our AMAZING ride through an AMAZING and beautiful park. Keep in mind, our children are 7, 9 and 11, and Adrian had them trotting and cantering with ease at the end of our afternoon spent together. The time, thoughtfulness and care that they spent on our little family was heartfelt and not to soon be forgotten... we all felt a connection with both of them. About 1 week later, we travelled to Patagonia and went on another horseback ride... yes, a typical follow-the-leader ride... our kids were bored and not impressed. They kept saying they wanted to go back to Caballos A La Par. Unfortunately this amazing experience will have a negative effect on any future horseback riding experiences we have!!Am typically not a major reviewer.. just wanted others to share in this.

I went with a friend, and we had a really amazing experience. Adrian picked us up downtown in BA and took us to his beautiful ranch, which I think is pretty neat--definitely representative of the personal experience you get when you go. The horses were super sweet and Adrian challenged us; I've ridden for several years, but it had been awhile since I had jumped, and he had me jumping over logs in the forest with no problem. I also galloped several times, which was tons of fun. My friend was jealous because Adrian didn't let him do these things, since he had never been on a horse before. He did, however, have him ride without reins, which I think he enjoyed. The scenery was amazing--it was really cool to ride for hours through such a beautiful place and not see a soul. Adrian was kind and pleasant, telling us about the land and how he started the business, and offering us food and drinks before and after the ride. I would wholeheartedly recommend this experience."

We visited Buenos Aires back in May 2013 and I have to say that our experience with Adrian at Caballos A La Par has persisted as one of the most memorable experiences to date. My husband and I are city dwellers, we were in Buenos Aires on business and thought it would be great to get out and experience something less urban. Of course, everyone recommends horseback riding but we have had weird experiences in other areas of the world that just seemed kind of lame. Then we came across all the awesome reviews for Caballos A La Par and it just felt like it would be a different experience. Well, all the reviews on here are spot on. Adrian and Miriam are absolutely lovely, and when you meet them, the passion that they have for both horse riding and for teaching are apparent immediately. Adrian picked us up in Buenos Aires and on the journey told us all about his life story, including how he left the corporate world and pursued what he is really passionate about - it's a really inspirational story. Once we arrived at Caballos A la Par, we sat down together, got to know each other, learned all about Adrian's polo and endurance racing background (ask to see his photos!), shared some mate, and then took a short tour to meet all the beautiful horses. From there, we enjoyed a 2 hour private session during which time Adrian taught us how to have the right energy, communicate, and direct the horses, before moving out to the huge trail area on the property. Well, by the end of the second hour we were were cantering and galloping across fields. At one point Adrian even traded horses with my husband to better facilitate a connection between the two...it made such a huge difference. As for me and my horse, Indiyo, we were quite content with each other and I eventually went solo down a path - which was something I never imagined would happen. In that short time, Adrian helped us go from being incredibly awkward around and on horses, to feeling confident and able on horses. And yes, afterwards there is hot cocoa, which is genius. I recommend this experience whole heavyhearted - it is one of the coolest things I have ever done on my travels. To Miriam and Adrian - thank you so much for sharing your passion with us and for facilitating such magical moments which we will remember forever."

First of all, this is for private parties where you can ride with your friend(s) and adjust the tour to your liking and needs. Secondly, this is a real home-grown grassroots operation, a business Adrian built from the ground up and you can tell by how much he cares about your experience.Adrian picked us up from our hotel and drove us to the stables (~20-30mins). We relaxed with some mata and pastries before saddling up and riding the beautiful natural reserves for a couple hours. It was so much fun but it can be a workout on your legs! Afterward, we headed back to the stables where some homemade empanadas and quilmes were waiting for us. A perfect way to end our trip before heading back on an airplane.Thanks Adrian and Miriam!

I'm back for a quick spin through the city and was able to ride and see their new facilities, so wanted to send an update! The riding is still fantastic, with plenty of chances to enjoy the scenery and trot/canter to your heart's content (I have ridden for 20+ years, including many spots in Latin America, and have worked at several Dude Ranches in the US and I feel strongly that Caballos a la Par is one of the best equestrian experiences out there), but now in addition to the world-class riding, guides and horses, they have purchased a new property which is absolutely spectacular! All of the horses have daytime turn-out pens, and they have a spotless and brand new stable for nighttime. More importantly for guests, there is a lovely pool (perfect for this hot, humid summer weather, especially after riding), a playground for children, and an indoor sitting/dining area with fireplace for cold days, as well as a picnic table to enjoy the outdoors when the weather is nice. Caballos a la Par is an ideal escape from the hectic pace of Buenos Aires, and if you haven't visited since they moved, I would strongly recommend a return visit! If you happen to be in Buenos Aires and have any interest in riding (and happen to be in BsAs), I would definitely recommend a day with Adrian and Miriam - whether it's your first time on a horse or you have ridden for years, it will be the highlight of your trip to Argentina!"

I love the out doors and was hoping to find a fun activity to get my husband and myself out of the city for a day. Well, we did! and our experience at Caballos al la Par was perfect. Neither my husband not I have experience with horses, but our host Mariam was an excellent teacher and the horses were trained very well and they were gentle. Before long we were cantering through the open fields and exploring the reserve at our own pace. Transportation to the ranch from Beunos Aires is provided by their private driver. The pick up spot is close to a Subte line so you can take the metro if you want. A hat and half chaps our provided so you don't need to pack your boots. Your host are very gracious and provide you with matte before your ride and a refreshing beverage and snack after your ride. The activities will take up the majority of the day, and you will be getting a bit of a workout if you aren't use to riding. Both my husband and I had a fantastic time and thought that the experience was well worth the price! Thank you Caballos a ala Par!"

I highly recommend Miriam and Caballos A La Par, if you're looking for an unforgettable experience and memory. I went on a private ride with Miriam during the first week of January 2014. This was definitely a highlight on my BA trip. The whole experience was great--from the time I emailed to inquire to the time she dropped me off in San Telmo at the end of the day. Mariam was professional and thorough with the organizing, communications and the instructions. The horses were sweet and looked well cared for. My horse's name was Indio, and he was an amazing animal. Miriam's passion for the sport and for being a great coach is the best part. I had a goal to learn better techniques and to have a very enjoyable afternoon flying through the forest on a great horse. With Miriam, I met this goal and much more."

After being in Buenos Aires for nearly a week in the middle of the hot summer my wife and I wanted an escape for the day without having to venture too far outside of the city. We searched on-line and came across Caballos A La Par. The best part about the reviews we read on TripAdvisor were that they were all true!From making the reservation and the pick-up in BA to the drop-off at the end of our adventure, everything was friendly and professional. Adrian and Miriam were wonderful hosts and never stopped smiling the whole time. Adrian was an expert instructor for two novice horse riders: he was always encouraging and challenging us. By the end of the day we were cantoring with confidence -- going so far as to be riding hands free!The setting is perfect and the forest reserve beautiful. All the space allowed us to explore, ride side by side and move around freely.The best part was connecting with the incredibly well-trained and gentle horses. I rode Isabel and my wife rode Indio and we both felt that these horses were the perfect ones for us.The afternoon was topped off with a refreshing swim and delicious empanadas. Definitely an amazing experience! We hope to visit again when we're back in BA."

            "review": "Horseback Riding the way it was meant to be.... Miriam was an absolutely fantastic guide. She met us on the southern skirt of the city center, near the intersection of Herrera & Av Gral. Iriarte, and drove us in her car out to the ranch, maybe 45 minutes or so. She's a safe driver, and that's saying something in B.A.!When we got to the ranch (using the term loosely, essentially a home with nice stables on a sizable piece of property), we leisurely grabbed a drink, put on sunscreen, and threw on some leather \"gaiters\" and an integrated helmet/hat. Everyone in the group had some degree of riding experience above and beyond your typical in-line guided horseback tour. Once mounted, we spent the next 20 or so minutes riding over to a very large park (previously an estate), learning the nuances of our horse, their tendencies towards pace, and attitude. We all had extremely well trained horses, each well attuned to the triggers for walk, trot, and canter. Once in the park, we were free to go where we pleased (while staying in a group) and where the ground safely allowed, bring the horses to canter. Even with it being a pretty warm day (in January, peak summer), most of the ride was tree covered and overall very pleasant. When we returned we left our horses with a couple of the ranch hands that promptly hosed the horses down and fed them several carrots. I mention as much because I feel like the horses are very well treated and not particularly overworked. Miriam had called in an order of wood-stove cooked empanadas that ended up being delicious. We cooled off inside, ate our lunch, and then hopped into another driver's car (arranged as part of the package) who drove us back to the edge of the city. Coming from California and having grown up around horses in Florida, this was a fantastic way to ride with autonomy and experience Argentina away from the wonderful hustle and bustle of Buenos Aires. I would 100% recommend this to friends and family."

The place is beautiful (there is a great pool for a little refreshment after hours of riding), the horses are adorable (Indio and Isabel were the best!) and you feel so welcomed, it's almost like spending an afternoon with friends. Miriam spent so long answering our questions, giving us advice about riding and it really helped me feel more confident about my skills. Whether you're an experienced rider or a beginner, you will find what you're looking for here. After riding, we were offered some tasty empanadas which concluded our experience perfectly.

Safe to say that it was one of the most enjoyable experiences either of us have had!! By the end of the day, we felt like we were family. You can really tell that both have a genuine love for what they do and put a lot of effort into making sure the horses are happy and treated with a lot of love. As some of the other reviews have said, you will be cantering on unmarked trails shortly after leaving Buenos Aires. We were cutting our time in B.A. down by a day and had to decide whether to pay a visit to an estancia or Caballos a La Par. I am so glad we chose the latter. My parents had traveled to Buenos Aires a few months prior to our trip and highly recommended spending the day with Adrian and Miriam. (See my mom\u2019s extensive glowing review of Caballos a La Par from Oct 5.)My wife considers herself a \u201cbeginner\u201d rider. She was riding with no hands within hours of starting our ride. Miriam was great and made us both feel very comfortable. Not to mention, the horses were amazing. My wife rode Indio and I rode Lindo. It was the highlight of our 2 week trip! We especially enjoyed seeing Adrian ride when we got back. Both Adrian and Miriam are amazing people running a really great activity. Don\u2019t think twice about this one!"

My husband and I have different levels of experience riding horses, so when we decided to ride with Caballos A La Par I was curious how they would manage this. Mails were quickly answered and we were picked up exactly on time at a centrally located and easily accessible pick up point in Buenos Aires. Adrian drove us to the ranch in about 35 minutes. After trying mate and talking about what we expected and wanted from the ride we got on our horses Lindo and Bandida. Adrian explained the basics to us (I am used to English style riding and this is a little different but I have to admit a much more comfortable style of riding!). We left the ranch and started our ride with Miriam. She helped me adjust quickly to their style of riding and within a short time she had my husband, who had ridden only once before, cantering comfortably. We had so much fun, it was great that we were the only people there (Adrian and Miriam never mix goups, the ride will be for you and the people you come with and no-one else). This meant we could ride at our own pace and do what we wanted. Because my husband quickly learnt to control the horse and walk, trot and canter, we could really enjoy riding together. I never expected this and it made the experience so much more special. As an experienced rider I also want to mention that Lindo and Bandida are amazing horses. They are so well-trained and responsive and genuinely happy to go out on a ride. All the horses at the ranch looked very well cared for and this is something you don\u2019t see in a lot of places where you can go to ride. Adrian and Miriam said the horses are part of their family and it shows, no doubt about that! After the ride we had drinks and great pastries and without any rush were brought back to the city. It was a wonderful day that left both of us with a huge smile on our face and we will definitely come back next time we are in Buenos Aires!"

No boring nose to tail trail riding! They really got my 11 year old son and what kind of experience he wanted and tailored the sessions for his interests. We've been back five or six times since then and they have given us the opportunity to ride different horses and try different excercises. It's a delightful atmosphere with special people and all I can say is don't miss the opportunity whether you are advanced or a first timer."

If you want a completely unique riding experience that offers one-on-one expert instruction while riding in a gorgeous nature preserve, this is for you! After spending two weeks in Patagonia, I have to say that this riding experience was the icing on the cake for my entire trip to Argentina. Adrian is a superb rider who will take you to the next level (or higher!) whether you are an experienced rider or a beginner. He has the ability to know exactly what your comfort level is and then to push you just gently enough to have you doing something on the back of a horse that you would never dream of. After you enjoy the Argentinian ritual of drinking mate` tea together, you will strike out into a pristine setting with no other riders in sight among the meadows, trees and streams of a beautiful preserve. On the back of an expertly trained horse, you will find your comfort and skill level with Adrian by your side. His expert skills allow him to advise on your riding while snapping photos and video of your experience. I was cantering with my arms out to the side through a meadow of blue wild flowers. Like flying through a surreal painting! I highly recommend this experience to anyone who wants the ride of a lifetime!"

Adrian is a very nice, genuine person who told us about how he went from a white collar job to following his passion, raising horses. The ranch is gorgeous and the horse are so beautiful. After enjoying some delicious matte with Adrian and Miriam, we headed off to learn horseback riding. Adrian started first teaching my wife. She is scared of animals and heights and only agreed to come as it was my birthday and I really wanted to ride horses ...a quintessential thing to do in Argentina. Within a few minutes she started to cry but Adrian calmed her down and helped her gain confidence and guide the horse. Soon we were in the beautiful nature reserve and Adrian worked with me to improve my posture and learn cantering. By the end of 2 hours my wife and I were cantering freely across open grass. The feeling of freedom on a horse is indescribable and Adrian is an amazing teacher. By the end , my wife was cantering well on the horse with a wide smile across her face. All the credit goes to Adrian. We even met an expat family from UK who were routinely bringing their daughter to learn horseback riding from Adrian and Miriam. Tired after the riding, Adrian ordered us some empanadas for lunch. We are vegetarians and the onion, tomato and spinach empanadas were delicious. They were the best empanadas we ate in Argentina. We left at 3pm and we were dropped off at the San Telmo street fair as it was Sunday. Horseback riding with my wife on my birthday was an amazing experience and Adrian gets all the credit for making it happen. He is a great teacher and with some effort anyone will learn to canter within hours. This is a must do when you visit Buenos Aires."

We have not been looking for an folklore event as it is mostly the case when you visit an Estancia.

Also the stable and the horses have been shown and explained, before we moved to the already saddled horses.After thr Ride we have been offerred bevorages, coffee and a lot of Cookies.Horses: very healthy horses in good condition and well maintained including saddle ect. The horses have been calm and Not nervos. From the beginning there was an easy Communication between horse and riderRiding: We have been a Group of two plus Miriam. Therefore it has been very Personal and Miriam adjusted each horse before we started riding within the fenced area, watched closely by Miriam. She must have been satisfied, then we moved on very shortly into the nearby park.As it was not a Weekend, the Park was empty and wo took advantage for our three horses.Miriam gave very precise recommondations in using the One Hand riding or to improve the Own skills. She also made pictures and Videos by using my Owen camera. Therefore a small One is recommended. We did all different kind of riding including riding without using of hands. The pritty of the Park have been emazing. Wie turned back to stables safely after more then 3 hours.Security: Starting from the meeting point,the transport,dring the ride, the payment and the transport back to the Meeting point, everything have been Professional organized an executed.SUMMARY: When your focus is on a realistic ride in a nice enviroment, in small personal groups with nice horses and a friendly skilled instructur, Caballoalarpar is the place to be in Buenos Aires.Special thank to Miriam for tis unforgettable day.

Adrian picked us up at the designated location and an interesting aspect of the day was engaging in conversation with him on the drive out to their newly built stables and then talking with them both prior to going riding. We drank mate prepared by Roberto their stable groom and this friendly experience put us at our ease. Strap on chaps with our lace up walking shoes worked fine and they supplied stylish riding hats. We went riding with Miriam for over two hours and she provided excellent instructions such that I achieved my personal goal for the day which was to do extended cantering through the high field grass. We also gave our camera to Miriam and got some excellent videos and photos. While there was only a limited opportunity for us as travellers there is no doubt that one would be able to learn significant horse riding skills quickly using the teaching techniques that Adrian and Miriam have developed.

They are wonderful!I can't wait to share the pictures & videos with my friends and family!"

It was a full day out with about 4.5 hours actually in the saddle. My wife had never sat on a horse in her life after a while with Miriam riding side by side my wife was cantering safely along. Myself a novice rider experienced my first canter within the first half hour with Miriam. Riding out in the open country with experts is fantastic. We had Mate dutiful Argentine pastries,and refreshments after riding. Picked up and dropped off in BA. A great experience at a very reasonable price for what is involved, great expert tuition of riding."

They are so kind and accommodating and best of all, they really love horses and teaching people. This is definitely unique from any other horseback riding tours out there. As a matter of fact, they made my standards so high, I am worried to be let down by other horseback riding tours in other parts of the world. Perfect for any level, everyone must make a trip out here to complete their Argentina experience."

Adrian picked us up in BA and we drove about 40 minutes to their stables in the countryside. The car ride was a great opportunity for him to get to know us, and for us to learn about him, their business and riding. He made it clear that the day wouldn't necessarily be easy -- there is effort that is required and what we got out of the excursion would be equal to what we put in.We arrived and their ranch and had some snacks, drank mate and learned about the business, property, etc. They had horses chosen for us based on our size, experience, and the general vibe they got from us during our email communication. There was about 30 minutes of instruction from Adrian on their property before Miriam brought my girlfriend and I out into the park.We began with walking and learning about control, pacing, etc. We soon began trotting and eventually cantering. Miriam is a sweetheart and a great instructor! There was very little pre-determined paths or agenda. We rode all around the park, stopping for short instruction and exercises. With little more than 30 minutes of \"practice\" we already felt quite comfortable and were thoroughly enjoying ourselves. We rode and chatted for hours before making our way back to the ranch for beer and empanadas.Even if one has never ridden before, as neither of us had, Adrian and Miriam are able to very quickly get us acquainted with the horses and property. It was a fantastic experience and a pleasant trip outside the city. Highly recommended!"

What a special day it was! Adrian and Miriam were excellent hosts, providing personalized attention to two inexperienced riders. They purposely take just a couple of people for each reservation vs. a group so they can really teach and guide each customer. We were surprised by how much we learned and how quickly we became comfortable to canter on our friendly horses in the open fields. It really was exhilirating!

Perfecto! I learnt to saddle, to then walk, trott and what seemed like no time I was cantering! Like OMG. ( I'm sure with a bit more practice I will be galloping in no time! Lol) The forest was SOOO beautiful to ride through.... Very special. It was exhilarating.... Freeing.... filled me with loads of feel good stuff. It is an experience I will carry with me always.

His enthusiasm is contagious and his love of horses is evident even before we arrived at his ranch where it is all about the horses. During the 30 minute ride to the ranch, Adrian is already \"feeling you out\" as far as your knowledge and abilities involving horses and is setting you at ease regarding the horse you will be riding. I had grown up with my own horses but my husband is your typical \"trail rider\" where every horse follows the other no matter what you do. None of THAT at Caballos A La Par! I knew he was a bit nervous and had reminded me that we were in Buenos Aires celebrating our 30th anniversary and would like to celebrate a few more. Adrian was amazing at making him comfortable even before we arrived. Upon our arrival, we were met by Miriam, Adrian's partner in this amazing venture, a soft spoken, beautiful lady from Holland. The property is impeccable, the horses out in their own individual pastures. We were given a tour of the stables that anyone would want to live in and of course, the two friendly black labradors followed. We then were invited to share in the mate and biscuits and once again, Adrian was doing his \"work\" sizing us up to know which horses to pair us with. He had decided on Isabel for my husband which is a spirited but very gentle pinto mare and I got my choice of Bandido, a Quarter Horse and Lindo, a Criollo gelding. Adrian started off with a quick demonstration on appropriate techniques and then got my husband on Isabel and quickly set him at ease. I started my day on Lindo and midway, Adrian and I switched horses and I finished the day on Bandido who was a dream of a horse! We rode through vast areas of trees and parks, getting to ride at our pace with instruction from Adrian whenever needed. Very soon into our ride, my husband was trotting and cantering with the greatest of ease all because Adrian KNOWS how to teach and build confidence and reduce your fears. He has several drills that really work and once you perfect them, you truly feel comfortable in your abilities. Let's not forget that these horses are so well cared for and so well trained (not in the method of head to butt trail riding) that they actually listen to your commands as a rider. That is almost unheard of with horses that are used with so many different riders and their abilities. Throughout the whole trip, Adrian is taking photos and videos so don't forget your camera or smart phone! After almost three hours of riding, sadly we had to return to the ranch.After unsaddling the horses and watching them roll around, we got to go inside and enjoy our choice of hot chocolate, coffee and drinks and I must say, THE BEST PASTRIES I've ever had. We enjoyed about an hour of wonderful conversation and really felt like we were visiting with family. Adrian is so warm and outgoing and such a pleasure to have spent the day with. It is so obvious that this is not just their job but their passion. Unfortunately, Miriam had a prior commitment so we were not able to spend as much time with her but those who are lucky enough to do so will surely appreciate her.Sadly, our day had to end and we were driven back to Buenos Aires but with such great memories of Adrian and the horses that will last a lifetime. I got the best benefit of all and now have a husband who actually enjoys riding for the first time in thirty years!"

We spent a week in Buenos Aires and were looking for something to do outside the city (and I had been wanting to go horse riding for a long time...) - this was the perfect choice! It was a well-organised, friendly, professional and very welcoming experience that I can recommend to everybody. Organising this day was really simple, since Miriam responded to my emails promptly and we discussed various options. Already when Adrian picked us up in the city he made us feel really at ease and very comfortable and excited. Arriving on the estate this was reinforced through the warm welcome, the mate we shared, the relaxed atmosphere and the way Miriam and Adrian really make you feel that they enjoy spending this day with you. The riding experience itself was amazing - the perfect mix of being professional and relaxed. They explained everything very well (we are both complete beginners), and then we went on this amazing ride with Miriam. The feeling of riding through the beautiful countryside while at the same time improving our riding and the relationship with the horse was incredible. We felt very well looked after and the hours spent on the horse were really exciting. Back at the farm we enjoyed an amazing hot chocolate and a lovely long chat, really feeling very welcome and w we could have easily spent a few more days with them... We spoke a lot about the horses, which are very well looked after, but also about Buenos Aires and Argentina more generally!I can whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone looking for a day away from the city and for a great riding experience."

My husband and I planned our honeymoon to Argentina and I really wanted horse riding to be an experience to share and fond memory for both of us. I have grown up with horses but my husband had only been on a pony once as a child. I was concerned that we would not both be able to ride out together and enjoy it due to our huge difference in ability. I did a little online research and came across Caballos A La Par. I was encouraged by the feedback left by others and the description on their website of the experience they hope to provide for you. I contacted Caballos A La Par and Miriam responded promptly, assuring me that they were able to provide an experience that would be enjoyable for us both. This was fantastic to hear although I didn't know quite how they were going to achieve it! Miriam also confirmed that we would be able to go out independently and would not be part of a group, which I was really excited about. Once we arrived I was immediately impressed and reassured by Adrian and Miriam's approach. The initial tuition before we headed out made it all seem so simple! However, this wasn't just due to Adrian's excellent ability as a horseman himself. The horses are wonderful. Such intelligent, gentle animals. They are so wonderfully trained and cared for that they make it possible for you to achieve so much in so little time. My husband took to Adrian's tuition extremely well and I was genuinely stunned when he was trotting and confidently controlling the pace of a canter in a few hours! I am so grateful for the fantastic video footage of us cantering side by side (a la par!) that Adrian got for us.You really are able to experience riding across open land and have absolute confidence in your instructor and horse. Unlike so many riding schools, you really feel like you're out with friends on horses you've known for years and the horses all respond independently to your instruction. There is no hint of follow the leader amongst them and in my opinion the riding style is the best of both worlds! A combination of UK and western, so very comfortable and manageable. The whole experience was so perfectly tailored to us and beyond my expectations. I haven't stopped telling family, friends and colleagues about it.From our collection to our departure we both had the most amazing time, words can not even describe the wonderful experience we both had. Adrian and Miriam are very warm, hospitable people and the location is fabulous. We absolutely loved every moment and I can't recommend it highly enough."

The first time I went it was at the recomendation of my friend Kirsteen and we arrived and had mate for the first time (which i had not tried yet since living in Argentina). The atmosphere is wonderful! the owner of the ranch Adrian instantly treats you like you are a long lost friend and welcomes you into the ranch and gets to know you before even taking you out to ride so from the begining there is a personal connection established so this makes it fell more like visiting your friend that happends to have a horse ranch. Once the mate was finished we went out to his beautiful horses which were already staged and ready to go. before even letting you on he makes sure you are confortable and asks you your skill level and then your off. while riding its not like those other turisty horseback riding \"adventures\" that you over paid for just to ride in a line and the horse wont deviate from what it sees the guide do. Adrian takes you to a field well many fields as you ride through the beautiful park that sorrounds his ranch while you are riding if you have little to no riding skills not to worry! Adrian will not leav your side until you are comfortable and confidant and then he lets you go off and do what he just showed you how to do! i have been riding off and on all my life and he gave me a few pointer and i was off. he really lets you do your own thing keeping vigilant of course and if he thinks you will do somthing unsafe then he will say something. but he rides with the group conversating and interacting all the way. the ride is probably the better part of 3-4 hours i loose track of time because riding with Adrian on his horses you forget the rest of the world and you just get lost in the moment. after a wonderful ride we returned to the ranch and had pastries and hot chocolate and then we return to the city. Adrian also offers personal rideing lessons which i am defiantely going to take him up on!"

From that moment on, the energy between all of us was that of old friends meeting after a long time. We became fast friends during the 45 minute drive to the ranch which is located in a beautiful national forest. At the ranch we were greeted at the gate by Miriam, Adrian's inspiring business partner and Indio,the gorgeous & graceful steed. Over the next hour we got a tour of the ranch, learnt about Miriam's journey and soaked in their hospitality over mat\u00e9! As we got into horse-riding gear, Adrian reminded us that we should be ready to put in some hard work over the next couple of hours and that it would make the entire experience all the more memorable. Soon, after some preliminary instructions, we were sitting gingerly on top of Indio and Isabel (Isa), a couple of very well trained, patient horses. For the next 2 hours, we trotted, we galloped and we cantored all while managing to stay on the horse..hallelujah!!! A big victory for us first timers. At the end of it, we felt like gauchos who had been riding horses since they were 5. The whole time, Adrian rode alongside us, sincerely encouraging and completely invested in creating a fun filled memory. The multi-talented Adrian was also our personal photographer. After the ride, we soon learnt that Isa was an impatient lover of carrots, a snack that we fed the horses as a reward. The day winded down over sweet treats and Miriam's world famous hot chocolate. Miriam drove our tired bones and happy souls back to the city during which there was more laughter. Everything about the day felt right and we were excited to have lived this day. At the end of our experience, my wife was convinced that we should name one of our kids Indio and move to Buenos Aires (Help Me). We left with promises of meeting again in Buenos Aires, New York and India!

We rode for about 2 hours and doing different activities. I totally recommend this place as it will be one of the greatest experiences you can have in BA, even if you are only a beginner. The horses are very sweet and very well trained."

Both are obviously passionate about horses and riding, and we found that everything they did was focused on giving us the best possible experience. It was a real tonic after the hustle and bustle of BA. We visited as a family of 5, and our kids immediately felt comfortable and confident under the gentle direction of Adrian. Within an hour our 3 kids were cantering, having previously had no experience of riding. It was a real pleasure to see them so happy and at ease on horseback. A really great day, we hope to be back very soon."

We both learnt so much and ended the day by cantering hands free (I never would have thought that was possible).The location is beautiful and it was great to be able to ride freely without having to follow a specific route or the horse in front. The horses are so well trained and they were matched to our specific ability and riding style before we left the stables. Would recommend to all!"

            "review": "HOT CHOCOLATE AND PASTRIES. OMG!!!. If you really like horses, and you really like riding horses, then this is the place for you. The horses are beautiful, the ranch is beautiful, the countryside is beautiful, the guides are beautiful,\u2026 you get it. Everything is beautiful!!! Yes, everything most certainly is.Caballos a la Par really lives up to its name, as the riding experience that you get is really side by side instruction, not your typical trail ride where the guide rides in-front of the group, and you are left to ride behind in the back. This is more of a 4 hour personal lesson on either teaching you from the ground up how to ride your horse confidently and safely, or improving upon the riding skills you already have. It\u2019s about making you the best rider you can be within the limited amount of time that you spend there. It\u2019s absolutely the best experience you will ever have if you are willing to learn and to put the effort into improving your skills when you show up to the Caballos ranch.We found out about this horseback riding experience along with a few others right here on TripAdvisor. So hopefully, my review will be informative and helpful to you as well. Since my wife and I both enjoy going horseback riding, we usually try to find somewhere that we can ride in each country we visit. Back home we try to go riding a few times each year. After reading a number of reviews about Caballos a la Par on TripAdvisor \u2013 both what others felt was good and bad about it \u2013 we decided that we would make a reservation.Very important: When travelling to Buenos Aires, try to have a cell phone that can browse the web, and send and receive emails. Almost, every attraction, or event that you can attend in this fine city can be reserved online. Email is also one of the most convenient ways to communicate, and be kept in the loop on event rescheduling, etc.After discovering Caballos a la Par on TripAdvisor, we clicked on the email link at the top of the page and were connected with Miriam. We confirmed our reservation and times via email. Miriam also asked to know how much each of us weighed, and what our prior riding experiences were, so that she could properly tailor the horses and the day\u2019s activities for both of us. They would send a car to meet us near the center of town, and we would then travel to the ranch from there. We corresponded with Miriam a few more times before the event during which she informed us that Hector \u2013 a very personable and talkative gentleman \u2013 would be picking us up.On the day of the ride, we were to meet Hector at the intersection of San Juan y Lima at about 2pm. We left our hotel in Recoleta AN HOUR before our meet time thinking that we would get there early, relax and check out the caf\u00e9. O! M! G! The amount of traffic between our hotel and the meet point was un\u2026 be\u2026 lievable! It took us an hour and a half to travel 20 blocks by taxi. I think we could have gotten there faster if we had walked. I was so afraid that Hector was going to leave us behind since we were going to be late, but Hector was there waiting oh so patiently for us right at the meet point. Car on the sidewalk. Buenos Aires style. Some quick introductions all around, and we were off to the campo only about 30 minutes or so outside of the city. The drive out to the ranch was quick and smooth \u2013 well, smooth until we got to the road that turns off the main causeway, and actually takes you to the ranch itself. I think we spent a good 5 minutes just rocking back and forth, back and forth in the car on the rickety dirt pathway that takes you to the ranch entrance. Once there, however, as the car turns left and enters through the front gates of the ranch, we were greeted by lush plains, and three of the most beautiful and well taken horses we had ever seen standing off to the left, saddled and ready to go.But first,\u2026 let\u2019s get to know each other a little bit. :-)After we got out of the car, we were greeted by Adrian. He was the owner of the ranch and would also be our riding instructor for the day. Usually, our experiences with many of the riding \u201cplaces\u201d that we go to the beginning or introduction is a very simple affair. We would usually show up, there would be other riders there as well. There would be some very cursory instructions on how to turn the horse left or right, and then we would set off. All in a large group, one behind the other. Today however, we were in for a very nice surprise.What we came to find out, is that each ride is very customized, and also very personal. You, or your party, will be the only ones on the ride with your instructor(s).Adrian greeted us, and took us inside where we all then sat down for some mat\u00e9. Mat\u00e9 is a traditional Argentinian drink, that is prepared by steeping dried leaves in hot water. We talked for a bit while we drank mate together, discussing what our previous riding experiences were, and what our goals were for the day. I shared that I have always felt uneasy riding a horse while it was trotting. Walking I\u2019m okay, but once the horse starts trotting, then I\u2019m all over the place, and I just can\u2019t seem to figure out what I\u2019m supposed to do to get into a good rhythm with the horse. It was then that Adrian said that, not only is he going to help us with that, but by the end of the day we would be cantering without holding onto the reins.What?!!! Yep. That\u2019s what he said. And, for sure I didn\u2019t believe him, but we finished up our last round of mate, and off we went. Well not before we put on some chaps, and took some pics. Then, off we went. To the horses.It was a bit cold that day. Not unusual for winter I guess, but we hadn\u2019t expected it to be so cloudy and windy this late in the day, so Adrian got us some coats and vests he had available before we set out on our ride.My wife was first. Adrian introduced her to her horse. Had her get on, and adjusted the stirrups and saddle. It was freezing, but I watched attentively as Adrian led her around atop her horse, and explained a few commands and such to her.I was next and because the hiking boots I was wearing were kind of big, we walked back to the stables to get some larger stirrups for me. Once I was on top and getting acquainted with my horse, trying to get it to walk gracefully. Well, the horse already knows how to walk. I\u2019m the one that doesn\u2019t know how to ride properly. Sure enough, my horse started trotting a little, and I couldn\u2019t figure out how to keep in rhythm, or if there even was a rhythm. Ha-Ha. It was at this point Adrian pointed out what I was doing to my wife and said: \u201c\u00a1A ver! You see how he\u2019s riding the horse now. Remember this moment, and you\u2019re going to see. By the end of the day, you\u2019re going to see a BIG difference. I promise you.\u201d Me, I still didn\u2019t believe it. We walked around in the clearing in-front of the stables for a few more minutes and then set off into the forest.The rest of the day\u2019s riding, all five(5) hours of it was filled with practice, and learning. Along wide open plains of grass, between trees and bushes in the forest. Coming upon amazing wildlife \u2013 like the largest rabbit/hare I\u2019ve ever seen (as big as a dog, and almost as big as the pack of dogs that were chasing it).There is so much more to tell from this experience. From finally learning how, to post properly while the horse is trotting, learning how to properly control the speed of our horses. Cantering, and\u2026 yes, cantering without hands! I couldn\u2019t believe it either, but I have the video to prove it.I think one of the best moments for me on the ride was when Adrian prompted us to go off and practice what we had learned, and I ended up off, and alone in the forest, just me and my horse Lindo. I enjoyed that stolen moment of peacefulness a lot, but the slow sunset ride back to the ranch, which then turned into a moonlight ride was really enjoyable as well.Back at the ranch we were introduced to the entire family, and the entire family of horses as well. The day wasn\u2019t over yet though as we all sat down for freshly made hot chocolate (a big thick bar of dark chocolate melted into hot milk on the stove, can you say de-li-cious!), and a wide array of pastries. It was a very yummy and delightful end to a very relaxing and fulfilling day.We talked for a long while, while drinking chocolate by the fireplace. It was all good fun, and we didn\u2019t end up departing until well after 9pm.My wife and I left the ranch that night, with the feeling that we had just left our long lost extended family \u2013 the nice ones that you want to hang out with on vacation days. Wishing that, and wanting to go back to the ranch so that we could ride some more, but we were soooooooo sore. My butt, and my back. Oh my gosh. I really wish I could have gone back and spent some more time there, but my body definitely prevented it.We left there very, very, very satisfied. So satisfied in fact, that we plan to take another trip back to Argentina, just so that we can ride at Caballos a la Par with Adrian again."

Some people say that the connection between a horse and its rider is magical and I never understood that concept until my experience at Caballos A La Par. My husband and I have ridden before but we were not properly instructed on the different styles and techniques. We arrived at the Ranch and were welcomed by Adrian and his dogs. He is a charming young man, whose love for horses is evident from the first few words he had with us. The horseback riding experience began with Adrian giving us a brief description of his Ranch and a nice cup of mate. He then asked questions about our riding skills and what we wanted accomplish on the ride. We began riding towards the park close to his ranch. Adrian began explaining the different ways to ride. We began walking our horses, and then cantering. The day was already chilly but as we began practicing we forgot about the cold and enjoyed the ride. We were having so much fun we completely forgot about the time and just focused on the horses and how much we were enjoying ourselves. Four hours passed and we didn\u2019t even noticed until the sun began to set and the golden rays began dancing through the trees; then we knew it was time to return to the ranch. I had never enjoyed riding as much as I did at Caballos A La Par. This was the most amazing experience I have ever had riding."

Not wanting to spend our entire stay in the city we decided to look for a more adventurous activity close to the city. We advised our travel agent that we wanted to go horseback riding. After researching on our own, it seemed that Caballos A La Par would be the best for us, and it was booked.On the day we were to ride, Adrian picked us up at the designated spot and we enjoyed the 1/2 hour ride to the stable. He was immediately very friendly and we were very at ease. Upon arrival we met Miriam who was also very friendly. After sitting down to a drink of Mate and more conversation in a room inside the house, Miriam went to the stable and picked our rides while Adrian got us outfitted.I have some riding experience and my wife has very little and is not very comfortable around horses. Any experience either of us has had has been on trail rides with one horse following blindly behind the other. This all changed under the guidance of Miriam and Adrian, who matched us perfectly with two of the many horses in their stable. Finally we were shown the correct way to trot, canter and post. After a couple of hours practicing we were both very comfortable and amazingly, not too sore (unlike other experiences). The horses were amazing and were so easy to handle. The property we rode in was great and there were no pre designated trails. Adrian took many pictures and some video of our experience, which we fondly look back on.After the ride we went back to the house and were treated to hot chocolate and pastries. We had made new friends in Adrian and Miriam and would definitely go back to Caballos A La Par to ride but also just to visit these two people who are very passionate about what they do.If you are interested in riding while in BA, we would highly recommend Caballos A La Par."

Whether a novice or an experienced rider, a horse lover or not so much, the half day spent in the country-side atop well-trained horses and under the watchful supervision of Adrian or Miriam is sure to be among the very best memories you take home.Located about 30 miles outside of the city and nestled in a 10,000 acre nature reserve, we were picked up in a central location in Buenos Aires and driven to the stable\u2014a wonderful chance to see some of the communities outside the core. Once at the ranch, we were welcomed by two handsome dogs and one of the proprietors, Adrian. Next step: we settled in to share a traditional Argentine mate ceremony (mate is an infused drink made by steeping dried leaves of the yerba mate in hot water and sugar). The process of brewing the mate and sharing it is as formal in its way as is the Japanese tea service, with each participate drinking from the same gourd and from the same straw. While a delightful cultural experience, the ceremony also allowed Adrian to \u2018size us up\u2019 to determine best fit with horse.In our case, I rode many, many years ago so was paired with Indio, a sweet-natured paint. My daughter had been on a horse before but never moved faster than a walk; she was teamed with Isabel. Once satisfied that I could sit a horse without falling, I was able to use the space to \u2018do my thing\u2019 while Adrian turned his attention to the novice rider. Within two hours he had her trotting, posting (rising to the trot) and cantering like a pro. Most impressive was how secure she became, with correct posture and complete confidence in her ability to control her horse. We returned to the stable happy (but sore); we concluded the day with excellent hot chocolate and a variety of pastries.The best news: Adrian and Miriam are completing work on an apartment which will allow visitors to spend one or more days at Caballos a La Par and explore the surrounding reserve in depth. That will expand the opportunity for adventure and the fun.Truly not to missed\u2026\u2026"

My wife and I were in BA for a week and decided we wanted to escape the hustle and bustle, and see the country side. After over-researching it (typical for me), we decided to take a chance on Caballos A La Par back when it had far fewer user reviews. Like it's many ratings now reflect: it was perfect and exactly what we had in mind. The location: absolutely stunning on a large nature preserve. About an hour's drive - very easy and you feel worlds away from BA (in a good way) when you get there. The host: Miriam is simply delightful. She played the role of the gracious host perfectly. She was warm, welcoming, and genuinely interested in getting to know us while sharing about herself as well (very interesting background). We could have spent all day just hanging out and talking with her. And, just as important, she was incredibly patient, supportive, and at ease while in the saddle. She's a natural when it comes to teaching.The horses: There are several and all are very well-cared for and well-trained. We both felt very comfortable the entire time (and this was my first time riding a horse that wasn't trained to just follow the tail of the one in front of it - which I now know is a much more fun experience). Miriam matched us up with horses perfect for our riding level, too (me: beginner; wife: intermediate) and we had a blast. If you have even a half-day, we HIGHLY recommend a trip to visit Caballos A La Par. It rounds out the BA experience well and you will have a great experience. Also, were building a guest house when we were there - had it been an option then, we definitely would have done an overnight in the countryside with a morning ride.We hope to be back someday and a visit here would be at the top of the list."

You are collected & returned & more importantly the horses are well cared for & trained. Ideal for those who are inexperienced, just as much as those who can ride well. Adrian & Miriam both speak perfect English & are genuine hosts who tailor the trip just for you. You will not join another group, do your time is your own. The best bespoked ride you could ask for. Refreshments, mate & lunch are provided & for summer time there is a pool. Enquire if it is in use. Your ride will be through a local national untouched park. The route will always vary, which the horses love & are keen to enjoy the ride just as much as you do. Whether you ride or not, this is an experience of a lifetime. I ride & would return & do it all over again on my next visit. I would be very picky if you are wanting to do a gaucho ride. There are a couple publicised by the hotels, many of which bus 100's of people in for the day & put on a show - very very touristy. Not advised.Hereat Caballos you feel like a gaucho on your own horse, learning more about your style, confidence & how to ride the horse at yours... & their very best. Trust me. You will enjoy this amazing day out!"

Both the trainers, Adrian and Miriam, were very welcoming and friendly. The first time i went to Caballos A La Par was in 2011, and after that time, i tried horse back riding in other places in other countries and there was none that could match up to the standard, the training, the place, and the people of Caballos A La Par and that was what brought me back again in 2013. This time round, i went with my mum, my sister and my sister's boyfriend. What makes Caballos A La Par so attractive is its exclusiveness that it offers to its students or clients. The trainers are very dedicated to making sure that we rode in the correct position and that we rode well and safe. Just like any student, my mum (and myself when i first went) who didn't know how to ride a horse, managed to trot and canter within one lesson. In my opinion, i strongly believe that Caballos A La Par is the only place that offers lessons of this sort. On the whole, it was definitely a very enriching experience and one that I would want to keep going back for if I was living in Buenos Aires."

Plenty of attention to detail in getting the saddle, stirrups etc just right......and off we went. The local park is as near to being in 'the outback' as possible, and 10's of thousands of acres in size. Very relaxed style of tuition by Adrian, giving one or two gentle pointers at a time leading to an overall improvement over time. The horses are absolutely fabulous; obedient, and very well trained.Back for a light lunch, and home by late afternoon. Lots of pictures as Adrian is kind enough to take our cameras and has an eye for a good picture.A fabulous day out."

I was picked up on time from the designated location. from the moment i was picked up i enjoyed excellent conversation learning more about life in BA. On arrival I was met by Miriam and Adrian who are wonderful and generous hosts. It was lovely to share a mate, and empanadas and chat with people who I had just met who treated me like a friend who they had invited into their home. I have been on horse rides many times but have never had any tuition which I was looking forward to but apprehensive about at the same time. Miriam provided very clear and supportive instruction and I learned more than I expected in the 2-3 hours of riding. The parklands were lovely and it was beautiful to ride as the sun was beginning to set. Miriam is a natural teacher who inspires confidence. The horses are clearly well treated as noted in other reviews which is one of the reasons I chose this company over others. The stable is gorgeous and the horses are obviously loved and respected. The horses are so responsive and well trained. Having been on trail rides in the past where horses just follow each other and appear bored it was fabulous to experience riding a horse that was so responsive.I enjoyed meeting the very kind and genuine Adrian who made the time to sit and chat after my ride with Miriam by the fire as we had a hot drink. He offered to drive me to a drop off area that was much closer to my downtown hotel.I hope to come back here when I get to BA and if they have the planned accommodation completed would love to stay a few days in this beautiful part of BA that is only a short drive from downtown but feels like a million miles away. I would highly recommend this activity to beginners and also to those with experience with horses who would like a beautiful Argentinian experience and advanced tuition from expert horsemen."

With some good riding instructions from Adrian you will ride a horse the proper way and enjoy the beautiful natural reserve. Adrian and Miriam are great hosts and make the whole experience easy and enjoyable. Loved it!"

            "review": "An excellent day out for first timers!. My wife and I decided to have a crack at horse riding on our honeymoon after we'd been talking about giving it a go for years and we were delighted with the results from a few hours at Cabollos a La Par!The day was a delight - kicking off with the meeting in at te prescribed meeting point very easy to find and you honestly couldn't miss Adrian. The drive back to the stables was pretty quick and doesn't really cut into your time, Adrain is very happy to talk and speaks excellent English which is always useful. Adrian and Miriam were a delight to meet, welcoming us to the stables with mate and great conversation. After a nice relaxing chat it was time for the horses... this would be my first time on a horse and the first time for many years for the wife, but with these horses it was easy to get started. Within a couple of minutes you could guide them around the paddock and then it's off into the countryside. It's a slightly strange experience for an Englishman to just be allowed to start trotting a horse out into the country but it seemed to be the done thing around here!The lessons are hard work (as my sore back 2 days later will attest!) but with lots of consistent feedback from Adrain we were soon able to master walking, trotting, standing in the saddle, \"trotting up and down\" and cantering! Overall I really enjoyed having the option to just \"ride the horse around\" cantering, walking and trotting wherever we please and it does give me confidence in riding more horses in the future.All in all this was a great day and one of the best things we had done in Buenos Aires. To Miriam and Adrain keep up the good work and good luck with the stables in the future, we'll definately stop by if we're in Bs As again!"

Key points of why it was amazing:- easy meetup/pickup from BA to the reserve- beautiful reserve and stables that were a perfect break from the city- warm welcome including delicious mate (tea) and snacks to relax before and after the ride - gorgeous, friendly horses (Isabelle and Indio were the best)- amazing, massive reserve where the park is literally your riding ground (yes, this was worth repeating)- really fun, relaxed yet amazingly constructive rideLast, but not least, Miriam and Adrian were wonderful hosts and incredible teachers. For someone who had never ridden before, their teaching style had me feeling comfortable cantering by the middle of the lesson. AND I'm officially hooked - just got home and have signed up for lessons nearby. Whenever I'm in BA again, I'm going back."

            "review": "The BEST of Buenos Aires. My wife and I visited Buenos Aires as part of my graduate school international trip. After reading several positive reviews online, we decided to book the horseback riding experience with Caballos A La Par. Our experience began when we were picked up in BA (pickup and return trip are part of the overall fee). We took the roughly one hour ride to the countryside and enjoyed seeing the outskirts of the city. While my wife has some experience horseback riding, I had never sat on a horse, let alone rode one. I must say, I was a little apprehensive. That nervousness immediately disappeared when we met with Miriam and Adrian at their ranch. From the minute we walked in they made us feel like family. We sat down, shared the traditional Mate tea, and got to know each other. We were then paired up with a horse based on our riding experience and personality.The ride itself was incredible!! We spent 2+ hours riding through pastures and enjoying the beautiful weather. It was perfect mix of learning the proper riding technique from Adrian but he was never overbearing. I went from having never been on a horse to galloping with no hands by the end of the ride. I could not believe it! Adrian also took pictures and video during our ride. At the end of the ride, we were treated to hot chocolate and pastries back at the ranch house.The experience was well worth every penny. You could really sense how passionate both Miriam and Adrian are about their horses and teaching others this wonderful activity. We felt like we made lifelong friends and we will be visiting again next time we are in BA. This is a MUST for anyone living or traveling in Buenos Aires!!!!"

This amazing adventure is must to do while in Argentina, dont miss it !I was met by Edrian with a big smile at the meeting point, he escorted me to his car till we reached his stables about half an hour drive, once reached met Miriam who welcomed me the same way, had chats with them in their lovely office and bar, had offered me the Argintina Mate tea in their traditional way then asked me about my experience level for horse riding.They are the owners and they trained you one to one, and have customized it for you only, they are very flexible and friendly and they do this for fun and not for money. They treat you like a friend.After that i rode a beautiful horse along with Miriam after Edrian showed me some important tips and hints in the riding journey, and we left the stables ( equestrian training center) to the green open areas (national forest park), really amazing feeling, there you can freely ride the horse with no fair, as the horses are very smart and cool and don't fall you down. It was really great when Miriam gave me the tips and hints for riding in practical way and you just need to listen to her. And yes at the end of this journey i was able to do the cantering for the first time and with my free hands too.At the end of this course i have gained confidence and improved my riding skillls and learned new things.Highly recommended if you are in Argentine and love horse riding regardless of your level.Thank you Edrien & Meriam, you were great :)"

            "review": "Amazing experience!. If you're looking for an activity and wanting to spend time outside of the busy city of Buenos Aires, this place is the place to go to - what a find! Originally my husband and I had considered going to an estancia to spend the day, but as soon as we came across this place we changed our plans and I am so glad we did. From beginning to end the service was excellent, but really more than service it was true hospitality. Adrian and Miriam really put their heart and soul into the place and their horses, and it makes it an unforgettable day. Right when we arrived we were greeted with the social activity of drinking mate, which my husband and I were super excited about since we had only tried mate in tea bags and were yearning to try the authentic mate. Adrian taught us all about mate, how to prepare it and how to drink it. We had a lovely time chatting and drinking mate (and we made sure to buy a set during our stay in BA to bring back to New York!) Then we were introduced to our horses, who I must say are the most gentle and well trained horses. Neither my husband or I have much experience riding horses, but these horses were amazing and we never once felt nervous riding. We rode over three hours in the national park which was stunning! And the best part was that you are actually free to roam and ride in the open space. We rarely ever rode in a straight line one horse after the other. We learned how to trot, canter, and really control the horse. It was amazing how much we had learned and improved by the end of our ride. Miriam was an excellent teacher with so much positive energy. Bottom line, I would say that if you go to BA and don't spend a day with Miriam, Adrian and their horses you've missed out on a wonderful experience!"

I went to Adrian and Miriam's this friday and i had a perfect time with them and their amazing horses.I am a french flight attendant used to travel the world and to try this kind of experience and i really have to say that this one is defitly different to any of the others.This is really not something to take your tourist money but great and true people who will welcome you open arms and heart. You instantly know that you can trust them and you will have a great time. The horses are wonderful and you can trust them too.This is the must important to me, i have been riding in France for years and each time had this little feeling that i really have to watch out with my horse when i go out.Adrian horses ( i rode Bandida, a ex professional polo horse and Shake , arabian full blood) are never stressed by cars or dogs or anything , they never never try to put me down of their back.so i felt very secure and i could be focus on Adrian priceless advice about riding , position, and sipirit to enjoy and to be connected with my horse.You can go it in this beautiful landscape of the national Park and you really feel free and happy to be there.My cousin was with me and he never rode a horse before and he was a little stressed out.After half an hour he was confortable and enjoying and 2 hours later ha was able to have a really really good control of the horse and him self thanks to the extraordinary \"quality\" of horses training and the right advice of Adrian.There are many other good things i could tell but i don't want to boor the reader being to long.The only feeling i had was this people and their horses put their heart in every single details for the person who come to them so don't choose another one. This one IS the best ...maybe on earth.Thank you Miriam and Adrian, i'm looking forward to seeing you again.Guillaume"

            "review": "Do not miss your pick up with Adrian. This review has nothing to do with the skills and experience that both Miriam and Adrian bring to the party, but what happened to me a few hours ago when somehow Adrian and I missed our scheduled pickup at the appointed place. Since I had done this before I knew were to go, and what time, so at precisely 8:55 am I was at Playa del Carmen, and sat at the base of a tree to wait for Adrian. Half an hour went by. I had forgotten my cell phone, it happens, so I figured maybe something had come up or we missed connections. I was not mad, just curious. By the time I returned to the hostel Miriam had called, and then Adrian and I got on the phone. Then the fun started. What followed was one of the funniest and most frustrating conversations I have ever had with anyone, anywhere, especially internationally.Adriane effectively spent about twenty minutes telling me the same story over and over, about how he was RIGHT THERE AT THE RESTAURANT, HOW COULD YOU MISS ME, WITH A BUNCH OF TOURISTS, DRINKING MATE, the clear implication being that I must not have been. I said over and over that I was not angry, it was clearly a simple mistake, not a problem calm down, can we move on. I got the same story at higher pitch which when repeated so many times made it clear that he was angry at me for breaking their perfect record of never missing a tourist before, messing up their morning because they couldnt book anyone else (I had booked this time almost a month earlier) and there was lost income (the 150 bucks was right in my wallet for them). It was very, very clear that this was more about making the customer the bad guy rather than simply saying hey, we missed each other, sorry, maybe another time.Now you have to understand that three Brits were privy to my end of the conversation while this was going on and there were times I was holding my sides when Adrian launched back into the story about the bus and the tourists and the mate and they were in hysterics, because I kept saying its in the past, it doesnt matter, I am not angry, this is not important. But to Adrian it seemed very important to be right, he was there, I was not, I was wrong. As a long time management consultant, an author of a book on language and leadership and how we wield our words with customers, clients and employees, this conversation was a perfect study on how to kill a relationship. In my third book Exchange I talk about opiates, or compulsions, and one of the worst is the need to be right at all costs. You simply cannot browbeat a paying customer who is not angry in the first place and make them the bad guy for ruining your day, your perfect record, or whatever else you are upset about. Mistakes happen, and we all make them, and a little graciousness can earn a loyal customer for life. But when you go after your customer like Adrian did with me today, it totally sours the experience for me and its going to end up on a travel blog. This is a very transparent environment we all live in, and when I mess up as a professional, people are going to write about it. I cannot afford that and neither can anyone who is in the customer service business. Your ego simply has to sit down, and courtesy must come first. When I was finally able to get Adrian to calm down enough so that we could agree that nothing could be done, that that was that, and we could end this meat grinder of a phone call, I hung up and literally slid off the couch onto the floor laughing. The Brits cracked up with me. This story is going into my third book as a classic. I can thank Adrian for that much. I gave Miriam five stars in an earlier review because I very much appreciated working with her, her skills, and her operation. As far as those things are concerned, this is a good concession. But you had better not anger Adrian because he will take it out on you. That is fair warning. An as far as I am concerned, thats a bad business practice. Terrible."

It turned out to be a hell of present for both of us. We rode solid, well-trained horses through a range of beautiful backdrops, including trails, meadows, wooded areas and sawgrass 10 feet high. Through it all we received a constant stream of friendly but necessary instructions from Adrian, who accompanied us on our journey. My girlfriend and I are complete amateurs, having only ridden a few times each. But this did not stop us from enjoying ourselves immensely while picking up some great lessons in horseback riding. By the end of the day, we were trotting, galloping and developing a good chemistry with our mounts. Overall, Adrian and Miriam were wonderful hosts. Before the ride, they made us coffee and chatted with us in English and Spanish about the park, the history of it and how they went into business together. Afterwards, we shared a bottle of beer and told war stories about the day. We got some great photos and videos out of the experience and are looking forward to doing it again in the not too distant future. I highly recommend Caballos a la Par for any rider of any age or skill level. It's a great way to spend a memorable day with good people, while picking up some valuable equestrian skills in the process. It's also just a short jaunt away from the concrete jungle of Buenos Aires, making it an idea weekend escape."

After meeting at the arranged pick up location and about a 30 minute ride to their lovely brand new facilities, we were what seemed like a world away from the hustle and bustle of Buenos Aires. The serene surroundings, fresh air and slower pace were just what we were looking for after 7 days in the big city. Adrian started us off right with all the appropriate gear and a traditional Mate tea and we were ready to saddle up. After having ridden in various ranches in the U.S. and Mexico as well as a couple places in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico and sometimes having witnessed mistreated, not well cared for horses in some poor living conditions, we were both very glad to see fat and happy animals and amazingly clean facilities. They were beautiful and very well trained horses. My 14 year old daughter, who has ridden less than a dozen times in her entire life was soon galloping and in complete control of her pretty pinto Isabel. We really had an amazingly wonderful experience that was designed just for us. We learned a tremendous amount from Adrian and felt we had every liberty to explore all that we wanted and to really take our time and enjoy ourselves.  At the end, after we had galloped all about, including with NO HANDS (a first for both of us!) we put the sun to bed by volunteering to help wash the horses and put them in their stalls for the night. That's when my daughter spotted the adorable, very playful kitten and was trying to devise a plan to take her home with us. Thankfully she was persuaded to leave the kitten with the promise of a submarino (Argentinian hot chocolate) and some delicious sweets. It was a lovely way to end the evening.  We were only in Buenos Aires for 9 days and we fit in a lot. We saw many historical sites, explored 7 barrios, watched a soccer match, went shopping in all the best spots, took tango lessons, attended 2 theatrical productions, took the ferry to Uruguay, and hit as many of the best restaurants, cafes and street fairs as we could, and without a doubt one of the best memories we have from our trip is going to Caballos A La Par. We had a really fantastic time! This is a must do activity if you are in Buenos Aires. It was highly personalized, authentic and worth every penny!"

I have never ridden a horse before in my life, and Adrian thought me how to do it in one hour. He is very experienced and his horses are very well trained. I very much liked the entire procedure of the visit. First we drank some mate and Adrian and Miriam were making a profile of us in order to find an appropriate horse. I found it very esoteric. I got this beautiful horse Isabel (with one blue and one brown eye). Even though it was the first time for me to ride I could already do cantering without holding the reins. :) Also, Adrian was taking photos and videos of us the entire time which resulted in many nice photos marking our wonderful experience. I recommend you enjoy Buenos Aires through this activity as well."

We are intermediate riders and go riding everywhere we go on vacation. We have never found a place where the horses were so well-trained and responsive and where the ride is so tailored to your skills and wishes. Caballos A La Par is located only 30 minutes away from Buenos Aires, the park you ride in is stunning. Adrian and Miriam are wonderful hosts and make you feel like you are spending the day with friends. During the ride they offer useful tips and instruction to improve your riding which makes the activity even more enjoyable. When we arrived we met the people that took a riding lesson in the morning. They did not have any experience and yet all of them ended the ride cantering. This is a must-do if you want to ride a horse, no matter your level of experience. After our ride we had hot chocolate and the best pastries ever. It was the perfect way to finish an amazing day. Next time we visit Buenos Aires we will come back for sure!"

Miriam takes time to get to know you to find just the right horse. There are horses to suit any rider: both beginners and experienced riders will feel comfortable and still enjoy the challenge really good horses can offer. The horses are extremely well looked after and seem to enjoy the ride every bit as much as the riders do. The ride takes you through some of the most wonderful scenery to be seen from horseback. A wonderful way to relax and completely unwind from the hustle and bustle of the big city: traveling at a different pace both with your body and your mind."

I went to Buenos Aires mainly to dance tango, but I also wanted to do sightseeing. A friend had visited Caballos A La Par a few years ago recommended them to me. I'm so glad I went. It turned out that this was THE highlight of my trip!The registration process was quick and easy from their website and some emails to follow up. Adrian picked me up in Buenos Aires to drive to their location (30 minutes away by car). Miriam and Adrian were friendly and attentive to make my visit very pleasant. It was my first time on a horse, but, after 45 minutes in, I was cantering on a horse! I said \"personalized,\" because they do not mix visitors, so you will have their welcoming hospitality to yourself and your group (family, couple, friends). I traveled alone, so I received a one-on-one lesson from Miriam. She was a great teacher!If you don't speak Spanish, don't worry. They are fluent English speakers. Put jeans and closed shoes on and take US dollar cash. Then you are on your way to have a great experience at Caballos A La Par."

The fact that pickup and drop off from our hotel was included was also very welcomed.I had very little experience riding horses, having only ever done one trail ride previously. This was nothing like that. Adrian was essentially a private horse riding tutor for much of the activity, which was absolutely brilliant. On a normal trail ride, felt like I was just a passenger on top of the horse, but here I actually gained the confidence to feel in control of the horse which was an unbelievable experience. Adrian also doubled as our private photographer for the whole experience which has resulted in some fantastic photos and videos to help us remember such a fantastic day."

I have experience riding in the English style, but I have to admit, this was WAY more fun! Two of my friends, who had never ridden a horse before and I mean NEVER, were cantering side-by-side through the park within 2 hours of setting out. Absolutely amazing!Adrian picked us up in the city and drove us to the ranch, where he and Miriam, and two adorable dogs, welcomed us warmly with cheesy biscuits and a round of mat\u00e9. We were then introduced to the horses that were chosen to take us around and teach my friends how to ride. Adrian is an excellent teacher! He got both my friends to trot and canter in no time at all. They went from total newbies to confident riders in just a few hours.The horses themselves are also fantastic. I rode two, Indio and Bandida, during the course of our trip and they both have a beautiful gait. Even if you are a total beginner, like my friends, Caballos a La Par is an amazing experience. The groups are small -they will even take you out on your own rather than mix groups- which sets them apart from more touristy and less personal horseback riding trips elsewhere. After we got back famished, Adrian provided us with wonderful empanadas too!It may be pricey, but it was worth every peso to me!"

Adrian and Miriam\u2019s method of teaching is totally different to any riding experience we have had in the past; their style is relaxed and easy going but at the same time constantly attentive to helping you improve your riding skills.

The horses are gentle, very well trained and responsive and in excellent condition. Miriam and Adrian made our trip out to them so easy; they picked us up in central BA and dropped us back in the afternoon. They fed and watered us beautifully with delicious treats from the local town before and after our ride.

One thing was going horseback riding at Caballos a la Par. I lived in Buenos Aires for three years and was a regular customer back then. The biggest surprise was that they had moved to a great new place. The horses were wondering around outside feeling happy and looking well taken care of, the stables big and clean. There are also two dogs that have a doghouse painted in the same colors as the stables. Such a fun detail. Sadly it was to cold to have a swim in the pool. Otherwise I would have done that too.When I arrived we first began with drinking mate with some nice snacks. I was riding on a beautiful horse Bandida that I hadn't ridden before. She was so cute. We were riding through the park for more than two hours and I learned a lot again. The park was beautiful with autumn colors.When we returned to the stables we had something to drink and eat and a nice chat. It feels like visiting friends and it is always hard to leave. But I know I will return again. Thanks again Miriam and Adrian for a perfect day."

A friend of mine was joining us for the weekend and my wife suggested that we go horse riding. I was a little hesitant at first but it seemed like a good idea to get out and see the countryside. We were picked up at our hotel and brought out to the lovely new stables that Miriam and Adrian have built out close to the National Park. When we arrived Adrian and Miriam made us feel very welcome. We sat and chatted and had Mate together which was a nice experience. They used this opportunity to determine our various levels of experience. After that it was straight down to business.The three of us went out to the National Park (which was a stunning area in it's own right) with Adrian. All of us have differing levels of experience ranging from absolute beginner to one of us who had quite a lot of historical experience. Adrian was a brilliant instructor and spent time individually with all three of us while also keeping an eye on us as a group. He has a very good method of teaching and all the horses were exceptionally well trained. I had not been on a horse in about 15 years but by the end of the lesson Adrian had us all cantering with no hands. It sounds like an exaggeration but by the end of the lesson all of us found ourselves wishing that the lesson would not end.I can unreservedly recommend this as a fantastic activity to do if you are in Buenos Aires. If we had been staying longer I certainly would have gone back again but unfortunately we were leaving very shortly afterwards. Adrian and Miriam are really lovely people who are very passionate about what they are doing. They have a great facility and their horses are well looked after. All I can say is try it out for yourselves - you won't be disappointed. It was one of the best holiday experiences I have had."

Adrian, the founder and other co-owner, was welcoming but very clear that this was, while a fun activity, I would get out of it what I put in. \"Prepare to work hard\" he advised me, and suggested I would be \"cantering with no hands\" within a couple of hours.Of course I laughed at this, but after an intro mate session, an introduction to the horses, Isabelle and Indio, getting saddled up, off i went with Miriam into the most stunning national park surroundings.We had a lovely relaxed time, good conversation, and I was soon put at ease enough to, with strict direction and continual support, indeed get to the stage where I was cantering with no hands!

Miriam and Adrian are exceptional hosts and take extraordinarily great care of their horses and facilities. For anyone who is seeking a true horseback riding experience in the Argentine country, this is the place to visit. My sister and I were looking to spend a lot of time riding and decided on Caballos a la Par after reading many positive reviews. We were delighted to find that the experience vastly exceeded our expectations. Miriam and Adrian are extremely passionate about what they do and their positive energy is intoxicating (even the horses are ecstatic!). We were carefully watched and instructed on form and technique so that within the two hours of riding I could feel myself swiftly improving. It was awesome! And we got to see pictures and video of our performance to prove that we had come a long way in a short time. After returning to the stables, we were happy to learn how to remove the bridles and saddles and help with cleaning the horses. It was a pleasure to be a part of the entire process from start to finish. Miriam and Adrian are pros at what they do. The fee for spending a day at Caballos is a small price to pay for a life-altering experience. I cannot wait to return to see my friends!"

We really wanted to go horseback riding and had difficulty finding a facility that actually let you ride for hours in the countryside. We easily booked a day of riding with Miriam, the lovely Dutch co-owner of La Par, via the internet. She was really easy to work with, prompt, and spoke/wrote perfect English. She arranged for a driver to pick us up in the city and we rode a quick 30 minutes to the countryside. Upon our arrival, co-owner Adrian was waiting for us with a big smile and tons of energy. We were treated to some mate and an explanation of what the day would entail. We met all of the horses (and they have so many beautiful horses), suited up in half chaps and helmets and let Adrian lead the way. Mind you -- my sister and I ride horses once a year while on vacation and aren't the most seasoned riders. However, Adrian is an incredible teacher...patient and encouraging...and we finished the day having trotted and cantered (hands free) with huge smiles on our faces. The park we rode through was enormous with beautiful views in every direction. Our instructor spoke perfect English and his passion for horses and teaching was evident. We finished happily tired from a long day of riding and proud of our accomplishments. A dip in the pool with a view of the sunset and some more mate and conversation was enough to inspire us to book another day later in the week. Our second round on horseback was much like the first, however, this time we were able to ride with the lovely Miriam as well. It was really hard for us to leave because they made us feel so much at home and we love to ride. The atmosphere is stunning....I can't gush enough about the experience and we can't wait to return!Note: No need to exchange your money -- they accept USD!"

My horseback adventures were pretty scattered and diverse; mixed in with camels in Egypt, Morrocco and India, as well as burros in the Grand Canyon but my defining moment came here as Miriam trained me on how to really canter a horse, and I could let my horse truly run in the 24,000 acre preserve. What a thrill this was for me and I learned so much during this ride, surpassing all those trail rides that had come before it. The country, the beautifully tended horses, and the loving care we received from Adrian and Miriam idefined ths as one of my peak experiences. Travel is an adventure of the soul and this experience is the best definition of travel I can name."

Since I am travelling solo, it was so wonderful to be greeted warmly and welcomed into Adrian and Miriam's home, meeting their beautiful children and sharing mate tea while learning about its tradition. It was fun chatting about life in Argentina, getting a perspective beyond what is normally encountered in my travels. Adrian provided excellent instruction, providing constant but gentle reminders on posture, how to hold the reins and guide my horse Isabel during the ride. Soon enough we were cantering without holding the reins, and it was the most comfortable ride I've had in many years, using very comfortable saddles designed by Adrian. After the ride, I enjoyed empanadas and beer before cooling off with a quick dip in their new pool with jacuzzi. A very fun outing and a welcome relief from e big city of Buenos Aires!"

Adrian and Miriam are fantastic teachers and superb hosts. We were made to feel at home and comfortable. Adrian knew we wanted to learn to ride in one lesson and so tailored the class to our needs. We definitely \"rode\" the horses, instead of just sitting on a horse and it following the leader. We worked the whole time doing exercises and riding through gorgeous bush - so a great focus on skill development in a lovely setting. Also, they only take very small groups of people who know each other, so you are guaranteed individual attention. Then we jumped in their new pool to cool off and shared some empanadas and beer.

My boyfriend has never ridden a horse in his life, not even sat on one so when I asked him if he wanted to go riding whilst in Argentina I thought he would say no, giving me a free pass to go and enjoy the riding myself but he said yes! so off we went to meet Adrian and Miriam. What lovely people they are, so helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The horses were an absolute delight - Isobel my horse was beautiful and forward going, she wanted to have fun but she went at my pace which was fantastic.My boyfriend loved every minute of it and under Miriam's fantastic instruction he was trotting within half an hour and cantering hands free an hour later. He then cantered at every opportunity he could! I wish I had had this kind of tuition when I started to learn to ride 30 years ago!The great thing about it was the big open space so we could all ride alongside each other and not have to follow each other down small trails, it was big open spaces.What a fantastic day and we don't even feel too sore after it. My boyfriend is keen to get back on a horse and that is testament to Adrian and Miriam making his first horse riding experience such a good one.Highly recommend this - don't bother looking anywhere else as you cannot find better."

Despite have spent only several hours there, you are really treated just like you are a part of the family. We visited the new location, where they have a brand new pool.

Since 6 weeks i had been looking for a good place for a horse ride which is not the typical touristic tour where horses don\u00b4t have left any interest for people and running and know exactly where they have to go. I love horses and spend a lot of time riding in Germany and I had already made some bad experinces in Peru. But thankfully almost in the end of my travel I found what I was looking for at \"Caballos a la par\". Miriam was really helpful and could organize a horse ride for myself alone in 2 days including transport from the city. After arriving Adrian starts with a Mate ceremony because he first wants to know the people who ride his beloved horses to find the right horse for everybody. Then I could try three horses in the garden and choose two to take on the ride so I could change after the half of the time. And finally I started with Miriam on a 3 hours tour through a beautiful park where you just can go as you like without meeting anybody. You can freely choose how fast and where you want to go (as long as you don\u00b4t harm the horses and respekt the ground) and those beautiful, alert horses really love moving and running! Even if I usually ride the English style those horses \" understood\" everything I wanted from them and I really enjoyed my time and couldn\u00b4t stop smiling. After the ride I could help cleaning my horse (which I really appreciate!) and was offered some drinks and Argentinian sweets chatting about horses and riding with those warm hearted people. Adrian and Miriam have created a wonderful place with wonderful horses which they really take care of and which have just a perfekt life in their \"garden\". If beginner or advanced this is the perfekt place for an Argentinian horse experience!"

Our choice was horse-riding with Adrian and Miriam at Caballos a la Par, which proved to be the best thing we did during our stay in Buenos Aires.We were enthralled by the world they welcomed us into - a professional working stables, an easy hospitality with the emphasis on friends, idyllic parkland, and beautiful horses waiting to serve and carry you away on your adventure.Although classifying ourselves as beginners, we'd both been on horses before years ago. However after a few hours under Miriam's watchful eye and on top of one of her horses, we both felt the confidence that comes when you realise you've learnt how to do something well. The penny seemed to drop why people, in particular in Argentina, were so devoted to their horses. It was quite an insight.Of course, the stars of the day were the horses. Patient without being docile, they were amazingly responsive and alert. Each one clearly had character and you felt that a strong bond could develop over time. Those lucky enough to stay for a night in the future may well find this to be the case."

We walked, trotted, and galloped through a beautiful park. We went through fields, tree lined paths and a few small rivers. The entire time we were made to feel at home by Adrian (our guide) and the horses. It was exhilarating at times and leisurely at others. It was scenic throughout. It was truly a joy ride. The transportation to and from BA was quick and easy, the facilities are great and improving, and the hospitality we were shown was second to none. If you have the time while in Buenos Aires, I recommend you check the availability of this special ride."

I am a horse lover and occasional rider who finds most trail rides sitting on a walking horse boring. When I did book, I was hoping for green parkland, top horses and an individual lesson for as long as I wanted. What I found was paradise. The owners provided a superbly trained and gentle horse with lots of energy, an experience of a lifetime riding through beautiful 100's of acres natural park, and a friendship with individual attention that I will never forget. If I could wave a magic wand and transport this experience to home I would do this weekly. I have had many riding lessons but never a riding transformation such as this. This is not only the number 1 destination around Buenos aires it is the number 1 horse experience in my life."

I knew this would be a different experience when I arrived and learned that I would be on my own with my guide (the director), Adrian, rather than riding in a line with a group of strangers. The next surprise was when we rode into the park and Adrian told me there was no trail; I should go wherever I wanted in the immense national park. Although I've ridden a lot, he taught me more about form, holding the reins, and leading the horse than I've ever learned.Once I felt confident steering my horse, Indio, while cantoring, Adrian told me to drop the reins. I thought he meant to loosen up on them. When I did, he told me again, \"Drop the reins.\" While I tried to process what he was telling me to do, Adrian said, \"Let go of the reins!\" So I did. Then I held my arms in the air, as he instructed. It was an amazing feeling of total freedom, confidence, and safety. I left this trip in awe that I could do something I never thought I'd have the skill and courage to do.Adrian and his business partner, Miriam, are warm and hospitable, as well as wonderful instructors. If you ride horses, do this trip. If you want to ride, do this trip. If you never thought about riding, do this trip."

This was the best paid riding experience I have had ever and I have been on a lot of trial rides in different countries. I would recommend this for an experienced rider who doesn't want a borrowing trial ride or any beginner who actually wants to learn to ride on their own and gain confidence to do more than just walk. I got to ride for about 2 hours in the national forest. I never saw a fence, so Indio and I could have galloped forever! I love that feeling! Adrian was extremely helpful, kind and understanding. The horses were so good. Also, I forgot to put on bug spray and as it had just rained there were a lot of mosquitoes. But, without me even saying anything, Adrian radioed for Miriam to meet us out near a road and she brought me out some bug spray. I was bug bite free after that and really appreciated that extra kindness.  In addition, booking the trip was extremely easy and uncomplicated. They were the first place to respond to my emails. Also transportation from Buenos Aires was very reasonable which was a big requirement of mine.  I highly recommend Caballos A La Par!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmS3EFB8sMM&feature=channel&list=UL - for the video of me galloping on Indio!"

I was a bit nervous having never ridden a horse, but the instruction was great and I left wanting to take it up upon return home! The horses are great and very well trained. A quick road trip (with transportation to & from your hotel) and you are welcomed to their stable which is brand new, right on the edge of a huge beautiful park. Adrian and Miriam are so warm and welcoming. The best part is that the lessons are private so you get a lot of attention and really get to go at the pace you and your group like. I would recommend this to anyone visiting BA. Its for all levels and a great escape from the loud busy city. I was in BA for a week and this was my favorite activity."

            "review": "Riding in Paradise!. Having read so many wonderful reviews on this site about Caballos A La Par, I decided I had to try it out for myself being a keen rider. And I wasn\u2019t disappointed! Having been brought up in the countryside with horses, I knew Argentina was going to be a very special trip after not having ridden for years. I had done research into a few horse places and CALP stood out way above the others in terms of the feedback from people who had been. My experience started with Miriam via email who answered my questions not only promptly but thoroughly. She also picked me up at my hotel with the same efficiency which was an added bonus because I was very keen to get there and maximise precious time spent. It is a 40 minute drive approx to the ranch which is located inside a beautiful national park covered with old trees, long pampas grasses and gorgeous wild flowers. On our arrival, I was greeted by Adrian the other owner of the ranch and a local who immediately makes you feel you have known him for years. They kindly offered me a choice of drinks and naturally I had to try Mate, a local drink which is a huge part of the Argentine culture. Delicious too! After a leisurely chat about the horses and Argentina, i quickly came to the conclusion this was going to be a day to remember! After Miriam kitted me out in half chap leg protectors and a very cute cowboy style which is actually protective, we set off out to meet my horse, Indio, a horse with an adorable personality! After explaining the basics on the Argentine style of riding, Adrian checked my horses saddle, girth, reins etc. Being an animal lover, this was something I particularly appreciated as it is clear that not only is safety their priority but also the comfort and welfare of the horse is paramount. We then we set out for an amazing afternoon of wonderful riding through gorgeous woodlands, crossing through tracks in dense forest and cantoring across eucalyptus scented meadows. Indio is so funny and takes care of you! It is as if Adrian trained him to adapt to different styles of rider! The whole time I was riding Adrian instructed me when it was needed and with such encouragement and enthusiasm for me to try new things I had never done before even as an experienced rider. I felt I could have done anything that day with the confidence he instilled in me and also with such amazingly well trained and responsive horses! Half way through the ride, Adrian told me I could try his horse, Nahuel, a beautiful big horse I fell in love with and wanted to take home! I learned so much as it is totally different from English style that I have always been used to. In fact I would say that the Argentine style is much easier and certainly more free. The highlight for me was Adrian teaching me how to cantor without hands holing the reins. Thankfully to savour the memory, he even took a video so I can prove it to my friends back home. On our return we were greeted by Miriam who lit a cosy fire and was preparing coffee with delicious pastries. We then sat down for what seemed like hours laughing and chatting about all things Argentine! I also found it fabulous to see my cantor on video and Adrian told me how to change my posture to improve my riding. I know I could go on and on about CALP like most reveiwers on this site! All I can say is you have to go to really appreciate how wonderful it is!!! CALP is far more like being in the company of old friends rather than tourism hosts and it is such a laid back atmosphere where there is never the feeling of being rushed. Their priority from the moment I set foot on the ranch was that I spent a fabulous day and leave with a huge smile. They more than exceeded on both!!! Thankyou guys, I will be back again next year with any luck and shall bring my friends next time."

            "review": "Wonderful Horse-back ride near Buenos Aires. The husband and I were visiting Buenos Aires: he, for a business trip, me, for fun; he, a reluctant rider (to humor his wife), me, an avid, but nowadays, infrequent, rider. I was looking for an Argentinian equestrian experience that would be different from the Dia del Campo tourist-oriented attractions, and one where my husband would have a ride that he would enjoy rather than just tolerate, and where he could learn to handle a horse. Miriam at Caballos A La Par was able to give us just that. First of all, the arrangements were made by e-mail. Her responses were quick, informative and helpful. She arranged to pick us up at our hotel in BA, and arrived right on time. We drove approximately 45 minutes to the stable, adjacent to a huge beautiful public park the size of Buenos Aires in acreage. We were treated to Argentinian mate, which is difficult to experience if you are just on a business visit to Argentina, unless you visit someone in their home. We then geared up with chaps and a helmet disguised as a cowboy hat, which is a clever design, since it gives you the protection of a helmet, protects your face from the sun, and looks slightly cooler than a riding helmet.Miriam was smart enough to provide mosquito repellant. We were advised on close-toed shoes, but the husband would have been better off with pants that did not have such a prominent seam, since he learned the meaning of \"saddle sore\" the hard way. I wore comfortable jeans, but riding pants or even bike shorts under the pants would work.She gave us brief instructions, since we had ridden before, and we were introduced to our mounts, Indio (mine, really smooth and eager to go) and Isabel (also fine, a little more of a follower). We rode in the park. I was able to go off on my own, trotting, cantering, and Miriam provided some instructions on posture and position that made the ride more comfortable. I was trained on English riding, and the Argentinian saddle is more of a cross between English (no saddle horn, thinner stirrup) and Western (deeper saddle), and the position of the leg is different. She spent more time with the husband, providing instruction on his position and also getting him to tell the horse what he wanted her to do, and making her do it. Miriam had him trotting, cantering with great control, and he felt and looked like a real gaucho. Miriam was very good about documenting our ride with our camera, but the memory card failed, so our friends will simply have to believe that the husband rode so well.She had me ride without reins, and even gave me the chance to out and out run the horse across a field, something I would never be allowed to do in the states. It was exhilarating.We rode back to the stables, dismounted and enjoyed more conversation and pastries. Miriam has an interesting story, coming from the Netherlands, working for the government, traveling around the world, and now, teaching visitors to ride and appreciate the culture and countryside of Argentina. We were able to briefly meet Adrian, who is busy working on their beautiful future home and stable. Their love of the horses, and their kindness and generosity were impressive and unique. I would highly recommend this experience, and hope to return soon."

They worked to understand our skills and personalities and actually chose horses that would work well with us. We then proceeded to learn walking, trotting, and cantering. It was the first time that we had truly learned to ride, and Miriam was very patient with us. We were able to learn all techniques and had a wonderful time. At the end Miriam made us cafes and hot chocolate and shared local pastries. Adriano had a fire going by the table and we spent time reviewing our videos and photos (which Miriam graciously took!!).

Previously we had only mounted a horse once in our lives and it wasn't much more than going around in a circle. Our objective was to learn to ride a horse and make it go where we wanted it to go. After arriving at the stables, the day started with a nice chat with Adrian over a cup of traditional Argentinian Mate. We then were fitted with our gear and had a quick introductory lesson on how to ride. Once Adrian saw we were reasonably comfortable on the horse, we were led out of the stables by Miriam into the adjacent park. Miriam was great as she really nitpicked our form as we rode. I can still hear her in my head shouting at me like a drill sergeant, \"Keep your back straight!\" and \"Press down with your heels!\". We were delighted to have an instructor with high expectations of us.  Ad the end of the day we left having learned much more than we ever expected and we had fun doing it. We can now comfortably mount, maneuver, walk, trot, and cantor. If you're serious about learning how to ride a horse we highly recommend this place."

I have done it only twice in my life (in a two different parts of the world) a I strongly believe that my third time will change horseback riding from \u201ca random rides\u201d to a hobby. I have heard about Caballos A La Par from my coworker in my first week in the office and immediately decided to go riding the following weekend, which made my first weekend in Argentina the most exciting one, and also the most special, since now I have two more friends \u2013 Miriam and Adrian. I truly looking forward to have more visits to Argentina, and even if it won\u2019t be for business purposes, it will be to meet with my new friends, spent a day or two horseback riding, sit next to the fireplace in their soon to be brand new house and listen to their stories, tell some of my own, and simply spend time with my special friends. Since I heard about horseback riding opportunity through my coworker, who already communicated with Miriam about her upcoming visit, I really haven\u2019t done any research and had no idea where I\u2019m going, all I knew that I\u2019m going to ride horse for the third time in my life. When we were picked up in BA by Miriam, first a few minutes where enough to realize how great my experience would be. Miriam already knew me by name, even though we haven\u2019t communicated before. When we came to the barn, we were greeted by Adrian and spent some time near the fireplace trying mate for the first time, eating pastries and of course talking about the horses. Adrian and Miriam are AMAZING, and their life stories are truly amazing as well, and certainly made me think more seriously about what is it that I want to do in my life the most. These people are absolutely not in a rush to provide you with a required service and move on to the next customer \u2013 THEY ARE TRULY DEVOTED TO SPEND THE ENTIRE DAY WITH YOU, no matter how busy their day schedule could be. Miriam and Adrian are very focused on providing quality personalized experience to each rider, for every lever of prior experience, from very beginners to experience riders. My friend was an advanced rider and Miriam was able to provide training in a way that we both were always fully engaged in learning new skills \u2013 advanced and beginner riders at the same time. My two prior horseback rides were in the mountains, I was worried in the back of my mind that riding in the flat surroundings might be boring. The nearby park where we went riding was beautiful and very diverse in the scenery \u2013 many types of different trees and vegetation. The nature here is amazing in any time of the year. We went during the winter time and the pictures are gorgeous, I can\u2019t even imagine how beautiful here during the spring time. Miriam and Adrian are really focused on teaching you the riding skills, rather than just ride the horse. They are very patient and encouraging, as they have so much passion for what they do and love to share their passion with others. I learned cantering within the first hour of ride, and this is truly AMAZING. More so, Miriam also thought me how to canter without reins, I had no idea I would be able to do it. Miriam and Adrian have many horses that are well trained and can fit all levels of riding experiences. Throughout the entire time, we never just followed one another, but were free to ride on our own, change to a different riding type as we liked it. And even when the ride was over, Miriam and Adrian were not in a rush at all to take us back to the city \u2013 they treated us with an amazing hot chocolate, more pastries and showed us around their new facilities, which make me very anxious to come back in a month or two and be one of the first riders to enjoy a nice evening next to the fireplace after a day of riding. I am looking forward to visit Miriam and Adrian again and again. Thank you guys for such a special experience!"

I have horses of my own and could not imagine going weeks without the opportunity to ride! I read the reviews of Caballos A La Par and began communicating with Miriam via e-mail. She was incredibly responsive and answered all of my questions. Upon arrival in Buenos Aires, the rain caused us to delay the ride by one week-end, but it was worth the wait to experience the beautiful sunshine we had on the day of my ride! A couple of days before my scheduled ride, one of my colleagues heard I was going riding and wanted to join. I e-mailed Miriam to see if we could add anothe person and she eagerly invited her along! Even though my colleague had less experience riding than I do, Miriam assured me we would both have an excellent time as they were used to accommodating groups with multiple skill levels. On the day of the ride, Miriam picked us up and drove us to the country. I immediately felt at home at the barn around all the horses. We met Adrian and sat by a fireplace drinking Mate, eating pastries, and talking about many things. Adrian then helped us get saddled up and sent us on our way! The ride with Miriam was AMAZING. The horses were incredibly well-trained to listen to their riders and not just \"follow\" the other horses. There was no set trail - so we were really free to ride wherever we wanted in the park. Miriam rode all around us and spoke words of coaching and encouragement. We saw so many different types of vegetation and trees on our ride - it was truly wonderful and very beautiful. Throughout the ride, Miriam carried my camera and took so many great pictures of us. One of my favorite parts of the ride was when Miriam let us canter without the reins. She rode alongside each of us and took video footage with my camera! It was such a wonderfully free moment and I love having it on video. Being an advanced rider, I felt COMPLETELY satisfied with my ride. I was able to do everything that I wanted to do and I even had the opportunity to ride two different horses with very different styles. I thought that with my friend being less experienced, we may have to hold back on cantering, but that was not the case. The \"A La Par\" style worked great for my friend and under Miriam's excellent coaching she was able to ride with us and have an amazing time :) After the ride, we fed carrots to the horses and sat by the fire again. We had more pastries and hot chocolate and relaxed. It truly was the best experience - to sit around with friends and talk after an extraordinary ride. The best thing about Caballos A La Par (in my opinion) is the personalized approach to the ride. Riding together in the car out to the country, sharing hot drinks and pastries by the fire, riding horseback side by side (rather than in a line), being able to control the horse on my own (rather than having him already know the path) - all of these are just a few examples of the great personalized experience. Adrian and Miriam are passionate about providing this type of experience to their riders - and they do an EXCELLENT job. After that day, I can now say that I have friends in Argentina because Adrian, Miriam, and their beautiful horses are the BEST!"

Miriam and Adrian speak English very well, which is a bonus because I don\u2019t speak Spanish. The three of us chatted whilst drinking Mate (a traditional tea like beverage) and eating pastries (Facturas). Afterwards I was given a pair of half chaps and a specially designed riding hat to wear then I was shown my horse, Indio. Adrian gave me instructions on how to turn the horse, make him go faster and halt whilst holding the reins in one hand, which I had not done before. Miriam was my instructor for the session. We went out into the public park, which is close by the riding centre. I was a little apprehensive as I was quite rusty but Miriam put me at my ease and soon had me riding without reins whilst cantering across the fields. Indio was well trained and willing. The Instructors don\u2019t lead from the front but ride alongside you giving advice, instruction, support and praise. There is no set route through the park so the horses are not used to trotting and cantering at specific points on the tracks or fields. This gives you more confidence and makes you feel in control of the horse. I was encouraged to go where I wanted at a speed that I was comfortable with. Fantastic! Once the ride had finished and the horses had eaten their carrots, we shared some cakes and had a hot drink in front of the lovely log fire (it was winter after all!). Miriam and I discussed the ride with Adrian. Miriam had taken videos of me whilst I was riding so that I could study my position and make corrections where necessary. This was really helpful. Adrian looked at the videos and made some observations which I will remember when I am riding again. Miriam also took some photos of me with Indio. I hadn\u2019t taken a camera so Miriam used hers and sent the photos and videos for me as a keepsake. At the end of the session I was dropped off at a Subte station so that I could make my way back to my daughter\u2019s flat.If you would like to sample some of Argentina\u2019s countryside with attentive, friendly, and welcoming hosts who are passionate about their horses then look no further than Caballos A La Par. If I go back to Argentina I will definitely return to A La Par for another adventure."

A day spent riding with Adrian and Miriam is the perfect antidote to busy Buenos Aires and a great way to see some of the natural beauty of Argentina.We were picked up at our hotel and driven to the stable by Miriam. We were lucky that the weather was lovely and as we got out of the city and into the countryside we felt ourselves relax.When we arrived at the stable we were greeted by Adrian, he is pretty spectacular, right out of the mold of Nacho the Polo player. (as a side note). He got us outfitted in half chaps to protect our legs and hard hats and off we went to meet our horses. The horses were clean and in great condition. We mounted up and headed into the park which is spectacular.My husband is a total beginner on a horse and within 20 minutes of Adrian's instruction he was cantering along and I was blown away! We have video evidence of this because I knew that no one back home would believe it! Adrian is a great teacher! He had us riding without hands, racing along and in general having loads of fun, all in a beautiful natural setting.After a couple hours we went back to the stable and were offered hot chocolate, the likes of which I have never experienced ( I will not ruin the surprise here) and some fabulous pastries. We laughed with Adrian and Miriam over our adventures and then Miriam drove us back to our hotel.A perfect day with incredible folks that I now consider friends!"

And it will never become dull. The park is big and there is always another route through the park.Living in Buenos Aires has it advantages. The horses are sweet, but you are the one that has to work. They are not docile horses that only know one way through the park. But they have horses for everybody. It doesn't matter. What level of experience you have.After the riding thereis always time to drink something with eachother and have some nice facturas. It is always a great day for me and I cannot wait to go again."

If you love the outdoors, and need to get away from Buenos Aires for some hours, or a day... this is the place to be. Reading some of the reviews I am not going to say anything new I'm afraid, just add a few more positive remarks!The horses are very well taken care of, you can notice that Miriam and Adrian love their animals. As they want everyone to have a great experience riding with them, it does not really matter if you never ever sat on a horse before. The horses are well trained and will be matched with your riding experience. I am an experienced horse rider but it had been quite a while since I rode for the last time. I just hoped the horses would not be trotting along the same route day-in day-out, as that could have been quite boring Turned out that Caballos A La Par have the same philosophy and explicitly try to avoid this kind of routine!So we had a bright sunny day exploring the neighbourhood (a whole nature park!) on horseback. It's a very diverse area with woods, open fields, small hidden tracks... Simply perfect for this purpose. Miriam shot a video of me galopping, I felt quite a gaucha! The huge park calls for many more visits. As I might be staying in Buenos Aires for a while still, I hope to have more of these unique and fun days, riding with Caballos A La Par."

We were picked up in BA and enjoyed a 45 minute drive out to the countryside. We were lucky that our day was cool with bright blue skies, and the location of the horses is a park full of towering trees and grassy fields. Really a beautiful spot. Adrian and Miriam started us off with a casual tea in the farmhouse that really helped our young daughter get comfortable before we climbed up on our horses. Never having ridden before, we were a bit nervous but they were great with giving instruction and getting us comfortable on the initial walk out to the open park land. Once there, the \u201cserious\u201d riding begins. Adrian gave one-on-one riding lessons to us, which were challenging. Our daughter wasn\u2019t quite so brave, but she was talking non-stop for the next few days about how she rode a big horse and she controlled the horse all by herself. We certainly recommend this activity."

When our group of 4 friends signed up for half a day with Caballos A La Par, we were expecting a quiet morning of riding - perhaps just walking the horses on a trail around a park, and maybe some trotting for those of us who knew how.How wrong we were! Adrian and Miriam wanted us to do a lot more, and got us to do it too! The morning started slowly, and didn't know that the horses had been carefully selected to suit our previous riding experience. (Most of us had not ridden in years, and one of us had never sat on a horse before.) Suffice to say the horses were extremely well trained, even though we riders were not. The horses were also energetic, and seemed keen for some exercise, and a canter.Within 1 hour of enthusiastic coaching by Adrian, even our friend who had never ridden before, was cantering his horse like an old pro! I couldn't believe it! All of us had become much more confident in our riding in just an hour or 2! As proof, here is a video of how and where we were riding, at the end of that day ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFiKRqrNlKc )But a word of caution: After the riding, we discovered some leg and buttocks muscles we didn't know existed, which ached for many days following. But it was well worth it, for the great experience of riding in Argentina with Caballos A La Par!"

I knew I did not want a very structured situation in an indoor arena. I did not want a trail ride in which one horse plods behind another horse. I ride a little at home, and I've had many lessons over the years in different disciplines. I knew that I wanted to learn and to ride outside, on horses that are well-trained and well-taken care of. This place -- Caballos A La Par -- was all I wanted and more.  The experience began when Hector, one of their drivers, picked me up in Buenos Aires, and drove me to the stables. The trip took about 45 minutes. The stables abut an incredibly gorgeous, huge park. The owners/instructors/guides, Miriam, a lovely woman from Holland, and Adrian, a native Argentinian, met me at the stables. They grew up with horses and are expert riders and teachers. After very successful careers in the \"regular\" business world, they decided to leave the rat race and devote themselves to a small, individualized operation in the countryside outside Buenos Aires. They are both passionate about horses and about teaching -- and it shows in all they do. To begin with, we had mate and merienda together, and they asked about my riding experience. Then we went out to meet the horses. The two leaders had prepared three of their sixteen horses for us to ride together. First, I was given instruction in the small area near the stables. Then we headed out into the park. They watched me carefully, and gradually they challenged me with trotting, cantering, and then galloping. I was given freedom to ride, but also many useful tips and helpful advice to improve my riding. Adrian and Miriam were warm and kind, and we laughed and talked -- but they also gave me wonderful instruction. In fact, I would say that I've never had better instruction. The park in which we rode was awesome -- although we apparently only rode through about 5% of the park. The horses were in top condition, calm, and extremely well-trained. I'm usually a little nervous about riding a horse I don't know, but I was not nervous at all with any of the three horses. After riding, Miriam and Adrian and I had something to drink and a snack again, and they showed me pictures and video they took of my riding they will send me later. Then I was driven back to my hostel in Buenos Aires.  The A La Par experience was my favorite experience by far in Argentina, and one of my favorite experiences in all my travels, anywhere. Miriam and Adrian are 5 star people. Their horses are amazing (people are often asking to buy one of them, but they are never for sale). Their instruction and company were fantastic. The park was fantastic.  This was an absolutely amazing experience."

Both of us had no prior experience with horse riding.What made Caballos a la Par so special and interesting is that this is not your average amusement park train ride where you end up as a \"passenger\" on a horse. Here you truly take the initiative and become a rider. Adrian and Miriam did a fantastic job, being encouraging but at the same time gently pushing us to actually learn a lot in a very short time. Each of us received individual coaching and learned a lot about horse riding. They are great teachers but also warm and generous hosts. This was a truly memorable experience!We took the lesson in Argentinian winter (July) and dressed well for the cold-weather. But as you'll be working hard, don't overdress of use layers so you can loose one or two if appropriate."

A fulfilling achievement doing a 'hands free' canter that I did not think that I was capable of! All lessons, I believe, are very different one from each other, based on individual needs from absolute beginners to experienced, which Adrian assesses beforehand and as the ride takes place. This is 'riding' not just 'sitting' on a horse, expect a quality, professional experience. Responsive horses with super calm natures that love carrots!!! Some riding stables can be a 'cold' experience but the Caring & Compassionate way that both Adrian & Miriam take care of their horses, like family members, is infectious and added very much to the FUN day out that both my sister and I had. Loved the style of stirrup, saddle and the 'cool' & stylish protective riding hats. Beautiful and spacious mystical forest surroundings that added to the feeling of well being and the joint connection with the calmness of the open air and Adrian & Miriam's horses. A wonderful & exciting time, full stop and would highly praise the ethics and philosophy surrounding this wonderful team....."

Adrian was a strict but very encouraging instructor, teaching how the correct way to sit, to position our hands and feet, how to get the horse to turn, stop, walk, trot, and canter. By the end of the lesson my husband and I were riding on the horses while they were cantering (we had maybe 2 trail rides before this lesson). It was an amazing 4 hours in the countryside. We handed our camera to Adrian at the beginning of the class and he took lots of pictures and videos for us. All of them turned out great. After the ride, Miriam made us submarinos because I had been talking about how much I love the drink. I was so happy and had two big mugs. There were also ample pastries, many of them stuffed with dulce de leche, for us to enjoy. Somehow the conversation delved into life and doing what you love, and it's clear that both Adrian and Miriam have a real passion for teaching people how to ride. If I can give them six stars, I would.P.S. I found this place on TripAdvisor. Miriam asked me to put up a review, but I didn't have an account.

Imagine riding through the beautiful Argentinian countryside, better yet a national park with thousands of acres of woodland and rolling grasslands, astride a magnificent A La Par horse. If you can picture that you have experienced a fraction of the excitement and magic of riding a horse at the Caballos A La Par. Myself and four other friends were a mixed bag of riders ranging from advanced right through to novice, I had ridden a few times before but I was not a competent rider. This is not a problem at all as everyone is put on a horse relative to their ability, skill and temperament and then we all ride out at our own pace with constant instruction and guidance when you need it. It's the freedom of the learning experience that is so special, you wouldn't find this in the UK and it's for this reason that we were all so impressed. It's horse riding the way it should be.The horses were in excellent condition and very well mannered enabling everyone to settle into the ride easily and confidently. The instruction was delivered so well, friendly but focused, if you made a mistake it was ok but you need to learn from it. You are nurtured there not shouted at. Lovely people too.By the end of the day we all had smiles right across our faces, you couldn't explain how you felt, only that you had shared a truly amazing experience and learnt so much without really being aware of it.If you are visiting Argentina, especially Buenos Aires, and are looking for something special to do this is the place to go. Even if your not sure if you would like to horse ride, the instructors are warm and incredibly friendly and will make you feel so welcome and most importantly safe. I wasn't intending on returning to Argentina in the near future but I can honestly say that I will be back to ride again, it truly is an experience of a lifetime."

My partner had never ridden a horse before and was a bit nervous, so wanted a bit more instruction. I am so happy we found Caballos a La Par!Miriam and Adrian clearly love what they do and want to share their love of horses with others. We got lucky due to a last minute cancellation, we got to ride with both Miriam and Adrian. From they very first email they were professional and friendly. Miriam picked us up in BA and we drove to the farm. We got to chat and warm up with a bit of shared Mate and some tasty snacks, then off to the horses! They have very well trained horses and did a great job matching the horse to the rider (thank you Indio and Lindo!)This is not a follow along trail ride - it is a professional horse lesson! Miriam is a relaxed instructor with a good eye for details. Adrian is passionate with equal parts critique and praise. By the end of the 3 hours my partner was riding like he had been in the saddle for year. He was shocked by how hard it was and how much he learned in one day. By the end he was loving horseback riding. I worked on learning western style and with great effort broke my English riding habits (somewhat..)The day ended with more tasty treats and some coffee. This was truly one of our highlights of Argentina. It was worth every peso and in my opinion, for the level of teaching, is under priced.

I've never riden a horse before and with their great instructions I was having a lot of fun riding in a matter of minutes. If you're in Buenos Aires this activity is a MUST!Our horses were lovely and easy to ride. By the end of the day I wanted to adopt my horse \"Nauel\". The instructors Miriam and Adrian love what they do and they make this activity fun for everyone. We can't wait to return to Buenos AIres and do this again."

After looking at several options in Buenos Aires that sounded very touristy and bound to disappoint, I finally found Caballos a La Par. After talking to Miriam, I knew that I would get an authentic riding experience with them. Adrian and Miriam both love horses and love what they do and that makes all the difference. Although I had not ridden in years, they picked the perfect horse for me and tailored the day to my abilities, and it was perfect - getting one on one instruction, riding a great horse, AND being in beautiful wide open spaces! Absolutely fantastic! Don\u00b4t be intimidated if you go alone or if you\u00b4ve never ridden - you are in good hands. I learned so much in one day (thanks Adrian!) and had a great time with wonderful hosts. This experience needs to be on the top of your list for visiting Buenos Aires. I would definitely go back if I am travelling to B.A. again!"

Always plodding behind another horse and never truly riding. My trip to Caballos A La Par was everything I could of hoped for and reignited my passion for riding. The experience was 100% tailored for our groups needs alone and I felt we really got a sense of Argentina and their horses. Miriam and Adrian who lovingly and passionately run Caballos could not of made our trip more wonderful. Their knowledge and understanding of horses and riding was infectious and each of us really learnt to ride that day. The horses are fantastically cared for, completely individual and chosen for you specifically. So much attention for the best experience has gone into this adventure and I can't stress highly enough how much I recomend this for all levels of riders, beginners to advanced, you will get so much from it.The day was just wonderful and I would visit Argentina again for this experience alone."

After reading through all the fantastic reviews here I figured that Caballos A La Par would be something to consider when we visited BA last month, but I wondered, could it really be as great as everyone gushes here? I have to agree with a resounding yes. It was an excellent experience and a real highlight of our trip. If you want to learn how to 'ride' a horse rather than sit on one while it wanders around \u2014 then this is perfect for you. Adrian and Miriam are both passionate about their horses and the experience they provide which is the key to their success. The afternoon was hard work but also very enjoyable and rewarding \u2014 we quickly went from zero experience to being able to trot and then cantering through fields. I was amazed at how much we managed to do and on reflection it was because we had such an experienced horseman with us every step of the way, guiding us on our technique and correcting it as soon as he saw it was needed (allthough I have had nightmares of Adrian telling me 'Dave, keep your heels down' since). I cannot see how you would have this kind of experience with some of the cheaper options I saw advertised in BA.If you go make sure you take along your camera \u2014 Adrian used ours to take some fantastic photos and videos."

Adrian also taught me to ride without the reigns on my first ever ride, but I wasn't at all scared because I trusted Indio and Adrian completely.A million thank you's Adrian for making my day such a memorable one - I cannot wait to come back and ride again.

It truly was a unique experience that began when Miriam responded enthusiastically and thoroughly to my email request for information. I was pleasantly surprised at the speed of her response. I booked for my brother and I and should add that I think he agreed because of my interest. We were met promptly and warmly by Miriam at our hotel and she drove us out to the stables. She was informative as well providing us with information about Buenos Aires. We were greeted by Adrian and were I introduced to the Argentine ritual of mate. This alone is unique unto itself. You will see the gourds and straws in most shops but here you will have it explained to you and have the opportunity to partake in something uniquely Argentinian. It is during this time that you will get the chance to know both Miriam and Adrian on a more personal level and feel Adrian's passion for horses. Riding in the park provided a perfect setting for the lessons. We were warned that it would be hard work, but we started as follow the leader trail riders and ended being able to canter comfortably with arms outstretched. Both Miriam and Adrian stressed that they wanted us to connect with our horses and by the end of our time we certainly did. They pushed us only as hard as we were capable and worked to ensure we were better riders than when we started. Their positive energy and encouragement made us continue to strive harder. The day finished with empanadas, cold drinks and more than a few laughs. Regardless of your experience this is a must do in Buenos Aires. Both my brother and I agree it was a highlight of our trip. As with most things in life you will get what you put into it. However Adrian and Miriam will match your effort and then some. For me it was an experience to remember with the added bonus that I gained 2 new friends. Go, you won't be disappointed. Tell them their Canadian brothers sent you."

However, I was blown away at how wonderful Miriam and Adrian were. They were both beyond accommodating, and did a great job of quickly assessing my skills and finding an appropriate horse. Coming from years of dressage, riding in the open park was a little overwhelming at first, but in the end you will love it. Not having arena walls to think about is a blessing - you can actually just focus on riding! The horses were incredibly well-trained, and I had more than enough confidence in Adrian's ability to take control if something were to happen (Which it didn't, but as an advanced rider, it's something you appreciate). True hospitality, and a must for any horse lover visiting Buenos Aires. Believe me, you will not find a better experience."

Chatting with Miriam and Adrian over traditional mate and yummy pastries we learnt about how the riding school had come about and were made to feel completely at ease before meeting the horses and starting our lesson. We were both very much beginners, my husband had never even been on a horse before, but by half way through the lesson we were cantering and by the end we were cantering confidently together through a glade, Adrian filming us from afar. Although we obviously still have a lot to learn, we really felt like we could ride by the end of the lesson, a huge achievement in only 2 hours all thanks to Adrian's focused and reassuring teaching. After the lesson, exhilerated from our achievement and in awe of the beauty of the place, we sat and drank submarinos and beer and ate more pastries whilst chatting to Adrian and Mirian like old friends, a perfect end to a perfect day.

I hadn't been riding for years but I wanted to try if I could still do it and I'm glad I choose 'A la par'.I was picked up in Buenos Aires with another couple exactly on time and we drove half an hour to a nice ranch just outside town where we saw beautiful horses waiting for us. We were warmly welcomed by Miriam and Adrian. We sat down and had mate (argentinian type of tea) while they took their time to get to know us and to explain the mate-ritual. After that we got on our horses. I was riding Lindo, a very happy and sweet horse. I rode with Miriam while the other couple went with Adrian. Miriam taught me the Argentinian way of riding which is way different than the dutch riding style. A pleasant suprise for me was that she is Dutch as well so I was able to speak my own language. If you have some experience already you can canter and trot as much as you want while Miriam gives good advices. You won't be riding on a trail, but in a park between the trees and on meadows which is beautiful! Afterwards we had some beers with the other couple who went with Adrian and shared experiences. They were really excited as well and had been cantering while they had never been on a horse before in their lifes!I definately recommend 'A la par' for people with and without riding experience."

My husband is less experienced and I sensed a bit of apprehention as he had taken a fall at a previous holiday trail ride (they were badly organised). There was nothing to fear, Adrian is a brilliant host and passionate instructor. Miriam came to pick us up at the hotel and we had a good chat with her about the horses on the way, there was one other guest riding with Miriam that day. We enjoyed mate with them before we set off to ride Indio and La Pinta. The countryside is great, and was welcome after being in the city all week. We had a fantastic ride and Colin was cantering with heels down by the end. Adrian was great at keeping us on track on how to get the most out of the horses. I ride a lot back home English style and do 5/6 hour rides where we are galloping flat out. The riding here is very different and I had to adapt my style, so I was learning all the time which was great. I had a fun excercise cantering with no reins, while doing arm excercises. I could head off on my own while Adrian was working with Colin. All in all it was a brilliant day out and made the end of our trip special. We finished with Empanadas (vegetarian ones too) and beer. I would highly recommend this for both riders and non riders."

In addition to being mindful trainers, guiding us where needed (always needed since I'm a beginner), they are heartwarming hosts who spent hours with us chatting about Argentina, something that I didn't expect but left a lasting impression that will make me want to return the next time I'm there.The best part about the riding was that the horses were so well trained that even a dummy like me trotted, cantered, and was just about to gallop (so I keep thinking), when I was reminded that form is more important than speed.You'll have an amazing time and a great memory. Absolutely recommend this place."

I can honestly say if we had any more time in BA we would have gone again.Adrian and Miriam are such lovely, genuine people and clearly love what they do. Both are excellent instructors. I couldn't believe how far I came along in just a few short hours. The ride was great, our horses were perfect for us and sitting chatting before and after made the whole experience feel like visiting friends. I have had very little experience riding while my husband is a very good rider. This didn't matter a the ride was adapted to suit both of us.If you have any time in BA at all come here - you won't be disappointed!"

They picked us up from downtown Buenos Aires at around 3 PM, offered us some mat\u00e9 before riding and some pastries after riding. In the end they took us back to the center at around 9 PM and we had our well deserved rest. For students it wasn't very cheap, but when you go you will definitely get your money's worth of fun.I'm 22 years old and I was at Caballos a la Par with my wife. We had the most awesome teacher Miriam that really pushed us to try our best. It was great that Miriam offered to take my camera off my hands and she took as many pictures as possible. The best part was the fact that she realized that our camera could take video. She took videos of our cantering and everything! Not only did we get videos to remember the place forever, but also we got feedback from Adrian about how we did. I had never even touched a horse in my life so this was something completely new for me, but I was going around 20 km/h with the horse on my first day! The weather was amazing, the horses were kind, well trained and the place was huge to say the least. My wife enjoyed it so much, Miriam was laughing at her for having such a big smile on her face. :)We would definitely want to go back there if we have the time. I strongly recommend this activity to anyone from a baby to a senior citizen, go there and test your limits!"

We have been riding horses since were were children, but recently only occassionally. This was definitely an enjoyable, learning experience. Adrian and Miriam were very welcoming yet professional. The horses were also professional, in that I mean they pay attention to your directions, they don't just transport you down a path. The saddles they use don't have saddle horns as we were used to, but Adrian soon had us relying on balance instead of holding the saddle horn, so we were paying more attention to the horses rhythm. This was the learning experience for us. The whole visit felt very safe, but authentic. This was by far the best riding experience we have had of this type and we wish it were closer so we could do it again. Thank you Adrian and Miriam for such a wonderful day."

After a drive of about 40 minutes, we arrived at the ranch and met Adrian. We sat down over a gourd of mate and talked awhile so that Adrian could find out what we were looking for. I wanted a lesson, Tia wanted an adventure, we got both! The horses Adrian selected were well trained and perfect for what we needed. Adrian gave me frequent instruction as we rode and eventually had me cantering without reins! This for a guy (me) who had not ridden for 30 years! They were kind and generous and open to any question we asked. I highly recommend them! Tia will be posting photos soon. Craig"

I had been on a horse before, but only those horrible touristy things where your horse if half dead and they just go in a line. At Caballos A La Par, you get individual attention beyond expectations. Both Mariam and Adrian are not only excellent and patient teachers, but they listen to you and what your concerns/needs are. They spend time meeting with you - and to get the city \"rush\" out of your system! - before even getting on a horse. My husband did better than I did (NOT tough!) but I never felt pushed to do more than I was confortable with - but pushed enough to allow me the confort to try. I think that the horses are specially bread to be brilliant. Mine knew exactly what I needed and I do NOT beleive it was my skill!! :-) We are going again next week. Can't say I love horses yet, but I now feel I able to start to communicate with them. Huge step for me. Thank you Mariam and Adrian."

We opted to go to Buenos Aires for about 5 weeks and take language lessons there. We also wanted to use the opportunity to see and do as much as we could to enjoy our time in Buenos Aires. We checked TripAdvisor for things to do in Buenos Aires. Popping up number one was Horseback Riding Stables (Caballos A La Par). They had great reviews. My first thought: they must be paying someone to post these reviews. I was wrong. I agree with all of the prior positive posts. Second thought - my wife will kill me; she is petrified of riding horses. I\u2019m still alive, and she didn\u2019t file for divorce.First, aside from the riding, Miriam and Adrian understand that any business is providing a service and the provider needs to do all that is reasonable to provide a top-notch experience. They go out of their way to do that. From timely responses to emails, to offering advice on other activities in the area, providing snacks before and after the lesson, and just being wonderful advocates for their passion - horses!Adrian and Miriam were very understanding about my wife\u2019s fears and did everything possible to assure her should would be able to handle it. With Adrian\u2019s and Miriam\u2019s gentle coxing she was able to learn how to control her Indigo and canter.My wife and I have gone horseback riding a few times, on prior trips. Those sessions consisted of getting on the horse, staying in line, following the horse in front , and dismounting on return to the stable. The difference between those experiences and the experience we had with Caballos A La Par is remarkable. At the outset they teach you the proper way to get on a horse, hold the reins, position your feet and legs, maintain correct posture and most importantly control the horse. Not at all difficult. But those simple techniques provide the confidence that you can learn to ride. Give it a try."

My girlfriend and I love horses and when we are on vacation we always try to do a bit ofriding. So far every time we rode it was on a trail and always one horse following the other. After reading the great reviews on Tripadvisor we decided to take a lesson with Adrian and Miriam at Caballos A La Par. It turned out to be the best experience of our trip to Argentina!We were surprised by how much we learnt. Because of the instruction from Adrian andMiriam we felt in control of the horses for the first time and like we were actually ridinginstead of just sitting on the horses. At the end of the lesson we were walking, trottingand cantering wherever we wanted. It was so different from our earlier horseback ridingexperiences and so much more fun! If you want to feel what it is like to ride a horse and not just be a passenger on a horse, you have to come here. Adrian took pictures and videos during our lesson and when we watch them we still can\u2019t believe everything we did! Adrian and Miriam, thank you for the amazing day!"

If you are coming from Palermo or somwhere equally as far, take the subway as traffic is horrendous during this time. The driver, Hector, drove the 45 minute route from Buenos Aires to the polo fields of \"Caballos a La Par\". Upon arriving, Miriam sat down with me and drank mate. She told some interesting stories explaining how she went from Holland to working at a horse ranch in Argentina. We then discussed the beginners lesson for the day.Miriam is a wonderful teacher who has a lot of patience as well as experience riding. During the 2-hour solo \"beginners: lesson, we covered a great deal. By the end of the lesson I was able to cantor on the horse, \"Lindo\". We celebrated the end of the lesson with freshly baked empanadas from a nearby restaurant. On a side note: My camera broke and Miriam was kind enough to take pictures and video-tape me riding. She then dropped the discs off at my hotel in Palermo even though it was out of her way. Empanadas, mate, pictures (bring your own camera just in case), drive to and from Buenos Aires were all included in the lesson price!Make sure you bring cash to the lesson! There are no ATMs within a 45 minute radius of the ranch! Overall, a great experience!"

Not only did we have an excellent riding adventure but we also felt as if we were welcomed guests at Adrian's ranch. My daughter and I try to fit in a horseback ride on each vacation. However, we are by no means experienced riders. By the end of our session at Caballos A La Par, we discovered a new and exciting confidence.We were picked up at our hotel in BA and enjoyed a delightful 30 minute drive. Miriam, a co-owner, was a kind and interesting driver. When we arrived we sat down with Adrian and he offered us some mate tea. He explained the customs and etiquette of drinking mate and while we were enjoying it we all got to know each other a little bit. After \"sizing us up\" Adrian matched us with the horse he felt suited us best. We were thrilled that it was just me, my daughter and Adrian heading out. What great attention we were getting!Forget everything you thought you knew about riding a horse. Adrian started with how to hold the reins, what angle the feet should be and posture. He was tough but kind and in no time at all we were shaping up. It was wonderful to canter freely through the national park. We covered a lot of ground. He taught us how to ride with confidence, control and technique. Adrian had our camera and took plenty of pictures and videos. He is an incredible teacher with a real passion for what he does and a desire to share that passion with anyone who is interested. Following our lengthy ride, we gathered around the table again to enjoy delicious empanadas and cold cerveza. We talked leisurely and no one was in a hurry to call it a day. We left feeling as if we had new friends. What a great day!"

We experienced a horse riding program that was so well taken care of right from the beginning until the very end. Surprised to encounter a dutch speaking instructor at the meeting point, we quickly learnt that was just a coincidence, but a nice and comforting suprise for us dutch visitors. She introduced herself to us as Miriam and brought us to the ranch, meanwhile having a pleasant conversation on the city, its people and its culture. Both Miriam and Adrian, the instructor who took us horse riding are very laid-back and easy going. Adrian is a persistant and firm instructor, but even so nice and sympathetic in comforting you 'that you sure can ride a horse', 'make him listen to you' and indeed, we were amazed at the progress that we've made during the couple of hours of horse riding. It is a big plus that you go out riding in the free nature. And boy do you have proof to show your friends and family back home. Take your camera or smart phone with you. Adrian will make sure to take some great pictures and videos. You may not believe it yourself once you got home, but really it is you in the saddle with your hands high above your head while your horse is wildly cantering. Believe me, you do not doubt yourself when Adrian summons you to do this, because his calmth and faith makes you easily follow his instructions, not questioning yourself. Besides that you are so well taken care of (drinks and sweets included), you are not rushed through the program. Also, you will have loads of fun between yourself. Which is worth the experience already."

While emailing back and forth with Mirium, my enthusiasm for the trip grew. It was very easy to communicate and coordinate a time and place for them to pick us up in Buenos Aires. Hector, their usual driver was sick, so Adrian (the horse whisperer) came and picked us up. The ride out to the country was only 30 minutes long and filled with great conversation. Upon our arrival to the stables, Mirium and Adrian had us sit, relax and enjoy some traditional mate and biscuits. It was a very welcoming atmosphere from the very beginning. Once we were ready we went outside and met the horses we were to ride. Neither of us had any riding skills what so ever, however by the end of the day we were both cantering. Adrian's teaching skills were excellent. I am pretty easy going and can learn quickly. My girlfriend on the other hand is a bit more stubborn and gets frustrated easily. There was a point where she wanted to give up and cry. He was great in dealing with both our personalities in different ways. And she was also cantering by the end of the day. I was excited to be able to actually ride a horse freely in the state park (which is huge). Adrian was also very kind to video us and take pictures. So if you want to capture these moments on film bring a smaller camera you can put in your pocket, not a huge SLR. We ended the day winding down with a cold beer and pastries.

Adrian has a real talent for picking highly sociable horses that compensate for the rider's lack of confidence. Adrian's instructions make up for the difference and in the course of the lesson a confident relationship develops between you and your horse.

I was visiting Buenos Aires on business and wanted to do something a bit different to the usual sightseeing tours in the city - Caballos A La Par did not disappoint! From the moment I emailed my enquiry about my booking, Miriam and Adrian's professional yet relaxed and friendly manner was quite apparent. After being advised what I needed to bring (jeans/trainers and a camera!) I was picked up by Miriam from my hotel and driven the half hour out to the stables where we were met by Adrian and offered pastries and 'mate'. It was then out to meet my horse - Lindo, a real gentleman! Being used to English style riding, I was given tuition in Western style riding before we left for our ride in the beautiful surrounding parkland. Miriam was my instructor/guide - she was encouraging, patient and knowledgeable and I learnt so much in the time we were out - not just about riding, but about the surrounding area and life in Argentina in general. Nothing was too much trouble - it was all about what I wanted from my visit. Lindo was just amazing - safe yet responsive - a perfect choice for someone unused to Western riding! On arrival back at the stables I was once more offered refreshments and a chance to look at the photos and videos Miriam had taken during our ride before heading back to the city. I would really recommend this half day 'adventure' - its a wonderful way to experience the beautiful scenery of Argentina as well as the friendly hospitality from Miriam and Adrian - you won't be disappointed!"

Adrian is actually such an iconic Argentinian to me. We loved that he shared 'mate' with us. We then rode with him, and his enthusiasm, energy and spirit were amazing.My wife had never ridden a horse and I hadn't in more than 20 years. Yet Adrian made us feel really good, making us make rapid progress so that we were able to feel that we were truly horse riding. Adrian is really good a tuning his directions and rhythm to each and the fact they take people always in individual or very small groups guarantees that we always get his full attention.This is really an incredible experience, from beginners to more advanced, and one of the experiences we had that felt the most authentic in Argentina."

It may not be difficult to encounter a skilled horseman like Adrian, but an expert like him who is so dedicated to \u201cspread the knowledge\u201d of equestrian, instead of keeping it to himself, is rare. He is a \u201cgifted teacher\u201d who exerts his best effort to transfer to you as much skills as possible, even in times when you want to give up. As a beginner, I had one-on-one lessons with Adrian. After merely two lessons, I was able to canter an unfamiliar horse in rough terrain in another ranch in El Chalten --- I think this proves that it\u2019s not just Adrian\u2019s well-trained horses that do the magic, I actually \u201clearnt\u201d and could apply these skills on other horses. That is TRUE satisfaction! Besides, Adrian\u2019s relationship with his horses would just make every horse-lover envy. His ability to communicate with them amazed me. During the lessons, I can feel that his horses do not only obey him, they totally love him! If you have the desire to learn horse-riding like I do, don\u2019t miss this opportunity. I guarantee you won\u2019t regret one moment of it! *** MIRIAM DESERVES APPLAUSE! ***Miriam is also a horsewoman not to be overlooked. My friend, who swore she would never ever do horse-riding again after having a bad first experience in another country, was thrilled after with her lesson with Miriam. Miriam\u2019s gentle but effective directions have helped my friend to gain confidence with horses. Within just two hours, she was able to canter with a big smile! Moreover, Miriam is also a great organizer. Her excellent time management skills enabled me to take one final lesson on the same day I depart for my home country --- without haste or worry. I truly enjoyed every moment in A La Par."

We also saw the wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor and thought it looked like a unique opportunity to experience some of the countryside outside of Buenos Aires. Both my wife and I have extremely minimal horse riding experience but we were assured that this would not be a problem at all. We scheduled a ride and were met by Marian in Buenos Aires. She was a friendly and fascinating person, and we had a great chat with her as we had coffee and then drove to the Caballos A La Par ranch. Upon arrival, Adrian greeted us with open arms. We found ourselves sitting around a table enjoying mate with Adrian and Marian and chatting about Argentina!After our visit and refreshments, we received a brief riding lesson from Adrian and then set off on a ride with Marian. The national park we rode through was spectacular and offered varied terrain and scenery. Instead of riding on a set trail, we were able to explore any area we wished and to practice trotting and cantering in meadows. We wanted pictures, so Marian took a camera and shot great photos and videos during the ride. We had a wonderful ride over 2 hours. When we returned to the ranch, Adrian was again waiting with refreshments. We chatted more about the experience and his philosophy. He said that his passion is horses and he wants to offer an environment where he can share this with others. He stated that they like doing private rides because it allows each group to focus on what they want to do and at their own pace. It was so refreshing to see someone who was more concerned with the individual\u2019s experience as opposed to maximizing profits through large groups. His passion and sincerity are evident in every aspect of the experience. If you are even toying with the idea of doing this, you need to book a ride now! While you won\u2019t be a gaucho by the end of the ride, it will be an experience you\u2019ll never forget."

Miriam, graciously handled the arrangements and told me where to meet the driver that took me to the location. I arrived to find a clean but humble stable. There I meet Elias, who made mate for us. We sat around a table and passed the mate gourd and discussed my riding skills, or lack thereof, and what I wanted from my riding experience. I was fitted with half chaps (gaiters) and riding hat and taken to meet my mount; a beautiful white horse named Lindo. Adrian's mount was a handsome Anglo-quarter named Pintado. After basic instructions on how to start, stop and steer Lindo we set off. The first few hundred meters of the trail were unimpressive. However, when we reached the pasture everything changed, The pastures and country side we rode through were very beautiful. Dirt lanes shaded by trees and large open spaces bordered by wild hedge rows. Adrian gave a steady stream of riding instruction and coaching. He is an amazing teacher and made the whole thing a delight. Within an hour, I was riding at a slow cantor. Lindo was very tolerant of my inexperience. With each riding exercise, I became more confident and improved my balance and rhythm. Lindo let me know each time I improved my skill. By the end of my three hour riding experience. I was ecstatic. I cantered Lindo the majority of the way back to the stable. I felt like I was in my very own Western movie. I was certain I looked like John Wayne or Clint Eastwood and expected the MGM logo with the lion to appear on the horizon at any moment. The photos that Adrian took of me don't match the image in my mind. Lindo lives up to his name in the photos. I, however, just look like a grinning me and nothing like John Wayne. But it doesn't matter because it was the best experience of my nine days in Argentina. I would highly recommend Adrian, his crew and his horses to anyone. It's been over a month and I am still grinning and talking about fantastic and memorable riding experience. Muchos Gracias Adrian"

We spent the day out here yesterday after my friend found Caballos A La Par -- in short: it was simply an amazing experience. I grew up in New York and never spent any time around any animals and have always wanted to ride a horse (but couldn't bring myself to pay a ton of money for the pony rides that you get at most other places). I wouldn't have been more thrilled with my experience. Adrian and Miriam were great at gauging our skill level (read: none for me) and tailoring our experience to our needs - it was my first time on a horse and we walked, trotted, and cantered and felt comfortable and safe the whole time, and were never bored. Miriam and Adrian were excellent hosts as well -- so much so that I almost forgot about the horses! I really felt at home and felt as if I was learning from friends rather than participating in a business transaction. We started with some mate and ended with a beer, and had great conversation the whole time. Adrian also snapped a ton of photos and videos, which he gave us at the end, as a great souvenir. I cannot recommend this place enough!"

Adrian and Miriam are waiting for you with 'dulces' and something to drink... there is no hurry with anything, and with a little talk Adrian will find the perfect horse for you. My friend, Adrian and I were only with the 3 of us riding through this beautifull countryside... it was really amazing! Adrian takes the time for you to learn you how to ride your horse. My friend is a really good horserider but he could still learn her how to ride 'gaucho' style... For me it was a great experience to go in 'galop' and ride so fast on this horse in 'the campo' without any tracks or without any other people...You really feel FREE! It is not really cheap the experience, but if you see how the horses are treated, that you have a private guide/teacher and a private driver that takes you there and brings you home, and you have something to eat and to drink... Then it is not expensive at all! One of the best things I did in BA!"

I had never ridden a horse in my life but it was something that I always wanted to do. My adventure started with a hotel pick up by the warm and friendly Miriam who filled me in on what the morning would look like and kept me laughing all the way to the ranch. At the ranch, we had some traditional Argentinian tea called 'mate'. The drinking of mate is serious business in Argentina and Miriam filled me in on the proper way to do it. We sipped mate while waiting on Adrian to finish some training routines one of the horses. I felt as though I was part of the daily ranch routine and I LOVED it!Once Adrian arrived I quickly realized that he loved what he did just as much as Miriam and had the same ability to put you at ease and make you a part of their life for a day. He gave me some riding basics, suited me up with the proper riding gear and we headed out to the horses!Adrian mounted up and gave me some practical riding instructions and then Miriam and I mounted up and headed out.I rode a solid stallion called 'Indio' who would eat any grass within reach and as we rode of at a walking pace I became acquainted with the A La Par method (which means 'side by side'). This has to be the best way to learn to ride. Miriam constantly gave me pointers, corrections and lots of encouragement as we rode throughout the morning. I enjoyed every second of it! Miriam is an absolutely incredible teacher as only someone who loves riding and sharing the joy of riding could be. It was a gorgeous day and we walked, trotted and cantered through lovely scenery while Miriam progressed my lesson.In the end I was thrilled that I never fell but in fact was able to canter without holding the reins and even tried riding Miriam's steed which was a bit taller and slimmer and with a penchant for running (i.e. more difficult to ride).This is on my top ten of travel experiences ever!"

The adventure started with a friendly ride from our hotel in Recoleta with the wordly Miriam from the Netherlands. Her love for Argentina really comes through. We learned of the culture differences she sees - expressive freedom could capture the spirit of the country.Immediately upon arrival, Adrian proves the friendly warmth that Miriam described. The welcome eased any apprehension from our two kids or frankly from ourselves of riding on horses - unfamiliar territory for three of four of us. The journey felt like one through our own private estate. There really was no one there. While it was winter in Argentina, it was easily 65-70 degrees when the sun was out. Perfect weather for what turned out to be more athletically demanding than I had imagined.Our two sons, 12 and 19, were taken on a steep learning curve. All at once nurturing, informative, humorous and tough, Adrian's teaching style was nothing less than effective. By the end of the first day, as many other reviewers have pointed out, they were cantering and controlling their ride with just their bodies absent the reins.The obedient and kind horses were part of Adrian's family. It was clear that he was sharing them with us. We became one family that first day in the park. Smiles, feelings of accomplishment and even meditative healing coursed through us on the winding path. Adrian provides a transformative experience unlike any other because it is a trip that he himself has taken in his own personal life. It was so enriching we canceled another tour and instead scheduled another day there! It's too valuable and rich experience just to have once for the adventure was unexpected yet priceless.

From initial emails with Miriam the service I have received from A la par has been first class, We arrived at the stables and met Adrian who is a great character and a fantastic teacher, I am an experienced rider but still felt like I gained so much from our ride together in the park, Adrian picks the right horse for you after chatting about your likes and dislikes and experience. From complete beginners to experienced riders there is a horse here for everyone and I believe all riders of any level and age will enjoy a ride here. The ride in the park lasted over 2 hours, the surrounding were tranquil and beautiful with sandy trails leading in and out of woods, over rivers and through fields, it felt like we were in the middle of nowhere and really gave me the countryside fix that I was craving after being in the city. I would not hesitate to recommend A la par to anyone that loves horses as it really does off a great experience and if your in Argentina your trip is simply not complete without a couple hours in the saddle, I'm so happy I've already booked my next visit."

We started out with some basic instruction on our horses and then went right into the 20,000 acre park, which was a mixture of trails, woods and open fields. We got comfortable enough to start trotting and eventually even cantering, which was the most exhilarating experience. Towards the end of our ride, we even got to change horses to understand how different they all are. Our instructor, Adrian was very experienced and incredibly gracious and made our time riding a joy. The beautiful weather we had only enhanced the day.After we were done, we got back to the stables, fed our horses some carrots and had some snacks of our own.I\u2019ve never taken a horse riding lesson, so I can\u2019t say how this compares, but I can say after a week\u2019s vacation, this day was my favorite.

Adrian is an exzellent teacher who can quickly asses the riding skills of a group before you go on a ride and therefore picks the right horse for everyone. We did a wonderful 2h ride in the park wich is protected by UNESCO and the home for an amazing fauna and flora, my favourite were the Eucalyptus trees. I am not an experienced rider but under Adrian's instructions I felt very confident and in control of the horse and was cantering with lot's of joy during the ride. The ride was beautiful and it was very hard to imagine that we were only 30 min outside of Buenos Aires. I highly recommend it and already booked my next ride with Caballos a la Par in 2 weeks.Tatjana"

            "review": "Caballos A La Par - A name worthy of its reputation. For us it was the pinnacle of our trip; it was our first time in Buenos Aires and we were attending a conference. \"Caballos A La Par\" was our gate to serenity. We were looking up the top ranking 'to-do-things\" in BA and \"Caballos A La Par\" is ranked as THE thing to do. So we were already hyped up, and it's so easy to get disappointed once the expectation is high....and it did surpass our expectations by far.Once we contacted \"Caballos A La Par\", the communication was welcoming, clear and effortless. They made every effort so we could get to the ranch with no hassle. The ranch is located about 25-30 min away from BA once you hit the Highway. Welcome the trainers, such genuine and invested people. Adrian and Miriam would not hold anything back to make us feel at home. We were greeted with Yerba mat\u00e9 - don't forget to ask for Adrian's special Mat\u00e9!- and after a bit of socializing we were ready to mount the horses. It was our first horseback-riding experience and Adrian summoned the sleeping Cowboy in us! Such a fascinating experience on so many different levels. We were told there are no set-tracks and every time they would take the visitors to different locations. We were lucky to be there on a perfect Spring day and the nature looked breath-taking. Being first time riders, I am sure we could have easily fell victim to focusing on the learning part and forget to enjoy ourselves. Adrian and Miriam introduced a fair balance of learning while being mindful of the surrounding beauty. I yet have to see a trainer as invested in his students as Adrian. It was evident that it's a deep-rooted passion for him . We took few short videos and each time I watch them it brings smile to my face. On our way back to the ranch, we were riding as we are old-time riders, relaxed and engaged in a warm discussion passing other casual riders and greeting them. By the time we got back, there were two other tourists waiting for him. Call it coincidence, but we ran into the same people the next day in the Recoleta Cemetery and guess what; they had enjoyed every moment of their visit to \"Caballos A La Par\".After our ride, we sat down with Miriam, enjoying yet another special drink complimented by gourmet pastry. I think we sat together for an hour talking about everything and anything; and it felt like we knew each other for a longest time.I can only look forward to the day we meet again."

As a intermediate rider, and in my point of view, I got really good training, so I where able to gallop alone and independently. A dream come true.."

We don't ride horses in Colorado, but we could, so we debated about whether or not to do this. We decided that we would do it for the change in scenery which was awesome.And the park is unique but not nearly as unique as the horseback riding experience. Adri\u00e1n has an incredible talent and passion for horses, riding horses, and teaching people to ride horses. He was able to show 2 first time riders in my wife and I how to direct the horses and how trot and canter in a safe and challenging way. The attention was completely personalized to our comfort level and desire. The setting in the open park was fantastic and Adri\u00e1n made sure to snap lots of pictures and videos with my camera so that we could document the experience. His love of horses and riding horses was absolutely infectious.We really felt like we gained friends in Adri\u00e1n, Miriam, and Elias. And it was great to share mat\u00e9 with them in the traditional way, with the proper rules, before we began. We saw some great things in Argentina but we both rate this experience as the best one of our trip.Also, if you are concerned, English is spoken very well by both Adri\u00e1n & Miriam. They provide beverages and delicious pastries. They had very comfortable & clean restroom facilities."

I really wanted to go horseback riding since I had heard you could freely ride your horse in most of the places. This one sounded legit and the reviews were all 5 starts, so I called them. It was for a saturday and since I called them only 2 days in advance they had no spots. That didn't stop Adrian (the owner -instructor) to find a way and move some people around so we could go ride that day, since we were leaving Saturday night. Miriam picked us up in the morning and drove us to the ranch and it was really nice to us all the time, answering all the questions, talking about how she got into horseback riding, etc.Finally there we met Adrian, he had asked me about our weight, height, etc so he could pick the best suited horse for us. He had them ready and anfter meeting us he decided he had to change one, he just try to match you with the best horse for you. My girlfriend was really scared and he helped her to feel more secure and in control of the horse. In my case I really wanted to gallop but I wasn't sure how to do it, he taught me and at the end I was just galloping on my own the whole time.We felt there like we were in family. Adrian treats you like that, he makes sure you get the best experience possible. Yesterday I was seeing a video of that day and I felt that I had to write this review. First review in this site so far, but I had to do it. If I ever go to Buenos Aires again, I'll definitely go to this place again.Muchas gracias Adrian & Miriam!"

Making sure you get the style of horse you like and the experience you're after. My Mum and I have a lot of experience but we haven't ridden properly for a long time, so Adrian eased us in gently. But before we knew it we were conquering the fields and cantering all over the place.He likes to balance the experience by giving you instruction but also leaving you free to do as you wish.My Mum went home saying it was her favourite experience and I think I have to agree.Plus Miriam and the pastries are a lovely added bonus!"

Never would I have thought of going horse riding if not for my niece, who was very keen to go.... & it turned out to be the highlight of our 3-week vacation!! It was so addictive that we went back twice after the first experience. The first time we went, Adrian made an effort to know each of us better before he picked suitable horses for us. This really helped in building the chemistry between the rider & the horse. Under the expert & patient guidance of Adrian and Miriam, who taught us proper techniques and postures, we learned how to walk, trot and canter all in one lesson. With the beauty of nature, every ride is exhilarating! Thank you Adrian, Miriam & Elias for making this possible, you have truly set a very high benchmark for my future horse riding experience. If at all possible, we would love to come back for more!"

It is all about wanting you to get the absolute most out of the day and make a connection with the horses. Adrian does this for the love of it not as a commercial enterprise and welcomes you as friends. The park itself is beautiful and in such contrast to the city, yet it is only 30 mins away. Although we could both ride already, we were way better riders by the end of the afternoon thanks to Adrian's expert tuition. He videoed us with our camera (don't forget to take one!) so that we could see how we looked and what we needed to improve.We cantered and cantered around the park and through the woods on willing and responsive horses (I fell in love with Indio, who I was riding). We even cantered without reins.From the mate (made expertly by 'gaucho' Elias) to the pastries and the excellent conversation with Adrian and Miriam, it felt like a day spent with friends. I have ridden for over 30 years in many countries and have never experienced a day like this. I will have to return to Argentina (from UK) just so that I can come here again."

Adrian is an excellent instructor and really tries to ensure that his students really experience horseback riding. This is not your typical trail riding; rides take control of their horses in open plains and learn how to communicate with their horses. Marianna is an excellent companion as well; I went with two sisters and my mom. One of my sisters decided not to ride at the last minute and Marianna stayed back with her. Overall, this was an awesome experience for all of us, even my sister who remained behind. The mate we shared with Adrian and Marianne also made us feel very welcome and much more at home.This is definitely a trip that one would not regret, but cherish."

We knew that one of our goals was to take these lessons at Caballos a la Par. Again a wonderful connection made through TripAdvisor!!! Our confidence with this program began with the information gathering (pricing, availability) emails exchanged with Miriam. She was responsive in answering all of my questions and concerns. This confidence was reaffirmed as our day of adventure arrived\u2026. from the moment that we were picked up at our meeting point in the city by Miriam, to our car-ride out to the ranch in the provincial park, to our meeting with our instructor, Adrian, our sharing/tasting mate for the first time and ultimately to our lesson. For those reading this who have never ridden a horse or who haven\u2019t ridden in a VERY long time \u2013 these details are very important.My husband and I had little to no experience on a horse and so we opted to take the private lesson. As previous reviews have stated, this was not a \u201cconga-line\u201d lesson\u2026it was just for the TWO of us\u2026 We were reminded step by step of how to hold the reins and all of the other valuable tips to working properly with our horse. On horseback we walked through the park further acquainting ourselves with tips and reminders of proper riding and then when we had reached a level of confidence we went from walking to cantering. What fun and exhilaration!!! Adrian was by our side every step of the way, complimenting us, encouraging us, gently correcting us\u2026.I think that I can most simply summarize our experience as having accomplished something that we didn\u2019t imagine that we could do and all through the guidance and support of Adrian. He is a master!!!!! And the day was one that will remember for a very long time.Muchissimas gracias a Adrian y a Miriam!"

Not the usual walking around on a horse, following the one in front of you....but actually riding a horse. Just as the other reviews - we were cantering no hands by the end of the lesson, and i think the big thing - not with fear. Adrian's calm positive encouragement and focus on posture, and balance was the key! Out of all the things we did in BA this trip - my biggest regret when leaving, was that i was not able to take more lessons with Adrian as I believe he has a unique talent.

I really appreciated how they quickly developed my skills so I was in control of the horse. The series of exercises we went through and the practical explanations they provided made the learning experience the best I have had. Added to that, riding in the wide open spaces of the park made for a beautiful setting. Not a \"trail ride\" in any way. After our sessions at A La Par we had the chance to take polo lessons from another group. I was very glad that I had furthered my riding skills at A La Par before I got on the polo horse. I felt much more comfortable and in control. The personal attention we got at A la Par was very different from other riding experiences I have had. The next time we are in Argentina we will definitely be paying A La Par another visit (or two)."

So I had three lessons from adrian in A la Par every other day. It is about 30-40 mins away from buenos aires and they pick you up by taxi. The air was very fresh there and the hosts were very friendly. Before and after each session, there's refreshments, including drinks and bakery. they really take effort to make you feel relaxed and at home. The room in which we were sitting was warm and cosy (I was there in winter). There were many horses and the one I was riding was very well trained. Adrian is an excellent teacher, he pushes me a lot because he thinks I can take it. He was right and I really appreciated that. After three lessons, I can canter even without reins (He taught me from scratch). For three lessons, I learned what I can learn in a month in the UK. At the end of the first lesson, I already felt we were friends. We talked about argentinian traditions and how he became a horse riding teacher, etc. I think if I have a long holiday again, I'd fly back to buenos aires from london and do more horse riding because I learn it faster and better there. Adrian doesn't work for money and he doesn't mix people at all, which is good if you want to improve quickly. But you still meet people when you arrive or when you leave, and those were interesting people. He also loves horses and loves his food. It was an absolute pleasure to be taught by him and to visit a la par whilst I was in buenos aires."

I rode for many years when I was younger and while I don\u2019t do it regularly anymore, I still love it and try to find a place to ride when I am on vacation. I love riding, I love taking care of the horses, getting dirty, and the wonderful feeling of being tired from being outside all day.When I started searching for a place to do a daytrip, I quickly came across Caballos a la par, and it turned out that a friend had visited them last year, so it seemed like a great option. The communication with Adri\u00e1n and Sergio was great and we settled on a day. The day before I was supposed to go, Adri\u00e1n called and suggested we meet in the afternoon instead of in the morning because of the weather. It was of course fine with me.I was picked up in the city by Hector, the friendly driver, and we got to Caballos a la par in less than 40 minutes. I was so excited when we pulled in! There I met with Adri\u00e1n and also with Elias who works with him. We chatted for a while over mate and biscuits, before going outside. I got to ride a wonderful horse (Indio) and the afternoon was overcast, but not rainy \u2013 perfect! At first I was nervous, it had been a while since my last time and all of a sudden I felt a little anxious. But it didn\u2019t take more than five or ten minutes before I was comfortable; with some instructions from Adri\u00e1n I improved my posture and especially my leg position and before I knew it I was cantering along! It was an amazing feeling! Indio is basically the perfect horse \u2013 so friendly, easy to ride, receptive\u2026 I loved it! We were walking and running through the Parque Pereyra and it was so much fun. After a while we went to a more secluded part where Adri\u00e1n had me do all sorts of exercises without using my hands or the reins. At first I was a little nervous but it ended up being just great. You know it is an amazing horse when you can do those things. It was so much fun to gallop with my hands up in the air! I think I had a big smile on my face almost the entire time; I was so happy to ride such a great horse and enjoyed every second of it. Back at the ranch we enjoyed tea and beautiful pastries in front of the fireplace, while talking about horses and riding in different parts of the world. I should also mention that Adri\u00e1n uses special saddles that he designs himself. They are extremely comfortable; I was surprised that my legs didn\u2019t hurt at all after being on the horse for a few hours.I absolutely loved my experience at Caballos a la par and would recommend it to anybody, beginners and experienced riders alike. The wonderful thing is that Adri\u00e1n does not mix groups; i.e. I signed up alone, and I was the only one in my \u201cgroup.\u201d That means lots of individual attention and the opportunity to do exactly what you want and are capable of. For me, as someone who used to be an experienced rider but no longer rides much, it was just perfect \u2013 I got the time I needed to get comfortable again, and then I was able to do all sorts of interesting things. That makes the place very special \u2013 of course along with the wonderful attention to the horses; they are so well-trained and it is obvious that they are well cared for. I can\u2019t wait to go back!! Thank you to all humans and horses at Caballos a la par for the best day I had in Argentina."

However, with Adrian\u2019s skilful instruction, he was able to canter with poise (and confidence) within minutes. My own horse was extremely receptive; he responded to my slightest whim and moved like the wind. Adrian pointed out various technical defects in my posture and hold, and his tips proved extremely helpful. While I have ridden horses elsewhere, this was the first time I felt a true connection with the animal I was riding.

We thoroughly enjoyed our time with Adrian and the horses and look forward to returning to Caballos a la Par in the future."

Adrian and Miriam are also exceptionally good hosts, offering us traditional Argentine snacks, mate, and hot chocolate. We would love to visit Adrian again in the future."

It was overcast/misty the day of our reservation so we did change from the morning to the afternoon session to see if weather was better at the company's advice. It was better, and we were picked up in Buenos Aires by Miriam at a designated time and place. We drove about 30-45 minutes outside of BA to a national park where the stables are. Before riding we had Mate (a traditional Argentinian tea) and cookies. Then, even though it started sprinkling lightly we mounted up to ride after basic instructions by Adrian, the owner. We were taught proper position for riding and how to hold the reins properly. Once into the park in an open field, we were taught how to trot and canter. There was individual instruction and it was detailed enough that my husband and I both were able to control the horse and canter without feeling like we didn't know what we were doing. We rode for almost 3 hours. After riding, back at the stables we had hot chocolate and pastries. By the time we left we felt like we had spent the day with old friends. Miriam, who also rode with us, drove us back to our hotel when we were finished.I would very highly recommend this experience. We were taught confidence and technique on horses that were not \"follow-the-leader\" horses. They did what you told them, and at no time did I ever feel like I was in danger or because Adrian or Miriam were by our side, hence the name of the company. Additionally, language was not an issue. Adrian and Miriam's English was fluent and we had no problem understanding instructions or conversations."

Adrian s an amazing instructor, very patient and understanding, my partner was a complete beginner, I had some experience and had cantered once for 30 metres probably... Today both of us cantered without reins... Cantered long distances... The park is massive 20 mns from the main city, loads of free space to canter on your own... Adrian picked us up from city in the morning, had mate (argentine tea) and started with the horses, simple techniques, no complicated process like u do in normally, obedient horses, I had an Arabian horse Samila, it's tail stands up when u ride so I often confused myself that it was about to pooh, but that's the way Arabian horses are, very obedient horse...Most interesting thing I feel looking back is that normally beginners have 2 issues- having to control horse and how to control your moves n positions. Today I had absolutely no worry of controlling the horse, it was piece of cake as the horses a well trained by Adrian.I could just concentrate on my positions.Feel great about my partner, she was cantering without reins in 1 hour, considering it was her second time on a horse ever I find it amazing. We did a lot of canter on our own.Adrian has an amazing crew, Elias could jump over the horses, also taught me to make mate tea, very pleased with that, Mariam lovely Dutch girl who fell in love with buenos aires was very kind and drove us to city.Me and Lakshmi will be back in few years, next time with our little one who is now 2.Wish u all the best- Paul Mandoli, paulmathewm@gmail.com"

We were picked up at our hotel by a new employee from the Netherlands who had such interesting stories to tell us (made me want to move to South America). We arrived at the ranch about 30-45 minutes later where we were treated like old friends, not tourists. As a person who has never rode a horse, I was a little nervous for my first ride. Miraculously, Adrian had me feeling confident on the horse almost instantly. By the end of the day I was cantering like a pro (at least in my head) and my fianc\u00e9 was even doing tricks like cantering with no hands! (note: she has ridden before, but it has been years). This was also my first time drinking mate (tea) and it was a great communal experience. We sat around and talked about our ride, had some laughs, and ate some good Argentine pastries. No rush at all (one of my favorite cultural norms possessed by the locals)! I believe the title of this review says it all. My Fianc\u00e9 and I traveled to Buenos Aires after a stay in Brazil (Sao Paulo and Igua\u00e7u), and we were getting a little bored in the city. Buenos Aires is a great city, but it was winter and we were missing one thing...some adventure. We needed to be active! Spending most of the day eating great steak and drinking wine is great, but I must say that this ranch was truly the icing on our South American Vacation Cake. If you're spending a few days in the city, book this trip!"

I have not ridden in more than ten years and was never an expert, and Adrian had me riding a running horse without holding the reins! He was very patient and encouraging, and spoke English very well. The rest of the staff and the driver from the city to the ranch were very friendly and helpful as well. It was also a great experience to get out into the countryside of Argentina for a few hours, a nice break from the busy city. As I am not an experienced rider, I did the one-one-one lesson and highly recommend it because you get to learn a lot while still riding through an Argentine nature reserve.

I had concerns about safety and was very pleased with Adrian's gear and instruction. He has hoods on the stirrups, so its hard for a shoe to slip through and get caught. Adrian designed his own style hard hat... very cool looking, and approved by the FEI for international endurance rides. His horses are well trained for the job. They are willing to move away from the other horses and act independently, so they don't object to cantering off across a field and leaving the group, and they don't travel nose to tail in typical dude ranch style.After a number of days in B.A. it was lovely to be out in the country side with someone as warm and genuinely interested in his visitors as Adrian."

In a nutshell: Caballos a la Par was one of the best experiences we had during our nearly 3 month stay in Buenos Aires. They were very easy to book with via e-mail (in English or Spanish, at your preference) and our pick-up was smoothly coordinated. Once we arrived at the stables, about an hour outside of BsAs, it was peaceful and quiet. We were warmly welcomed and taken inside the little kitchen area for breakfast. Everyone (us, our taxi driver, the stable assistant, and Adrian (the owner) sat down and had a nice conversation; we spoke in Spanish but they would have gladly spoken in English. It was one of those rare moments in tourism when you felt that the business owner/operator genuinely enjoys that type of interaction, just a great guy overall. He takes very good care of his horses and takes a lot of pride in what he does. Our ride was a phenomenal experience. Neither of us had been on a horse in years, but Adrian was a very patient and skillful instructor. Within an hour, we were cantering the horses quite comfortably. The trails were through pastoral fields, very pretty and pleasant. The horses were very \"kind,\" for lack of a better word; they tolerated our bad horsemanship with aplomb and were very responsive to inputs. Adrian took pictures and videos of us riding with our camera; they turned out really well and are great momentos! After the ride we were again invited into the kitchen for snacks and refreshments, and of course, more good conversation. Overall, Caballos a la Par was a really pleasant, friendly, top quality experience. We recommend this as a fun day trip for visitors and residents alike."

I wasn't sure what to expect when I signed up for this experience given that my previous experience was limited to several trail rides over a period of ten years and the fact that I was heading out by myself in a foreign country but it definitely exceeded my expectations. The driver met me at the nominated location at the correct time and drove me about 30 minutes to meet up with Adrian and his lovely staff. From the very first moment Adrian treated me like family and it is obvious that horses are his passion. Adrian matched me up with Indio. Fortunately Indio and I made friends straight away and was a very forgiving horse and got me out of trouble when this inexperienced rider made mistakes. We went riding in the national park and because his afternoon client had cancelled he basicaly said we could ride until I got tired. I didn't think I could do it but I too was able to cantor without hands by the time I finished. Adrian is super patient and if you are willing to receive constructive advice you will get a lot out of this. If you want to learn more about riding rather than just go on a follow the leader trail ride then this is the experience for you. If I lived in Buenos Aires I would definitely return to take more lessons. As for value for money, I've paid more for most of my trail rides and have never got as much out of it as I did with my day with Adrian."

E-mail queries were handled promptly and informed me of every aspect of what they had to offer. It sounded good. And it delivered. I was picked up exactly when and where I was told I would be. Half an hour later, we were sitting around a table drinking yerba mate. Adrian asked me about my riding experience while the horses were being saddled. A la Par is on the edge of a National Park and within a few minutes of leaving their place we were trotting through autumn leaved trees. I had some horse riding experience so wasn't sure how much Adrian could teach me, but he was fantastic. I had never had such detailed tips about what I was doing right or wrong. Adrian watched me intently, pointing out my body position, the angle of my feet, knees, hand position. He told me if I was comfortable, then the horse was comfortable. I relaxed. But Adrian didn't. He watched me intently, continuously suggesting improvements. We trotted, then cantered and within half an hour he had me with my arms in the air while cantering. I felt completely safe at all times. My horse, Indiana, was excellent, responding perfectly to my commands. Clearly, this was a different riding experience to so many others. A la Par means side by side and Adrian is a passionate person who believes in what he is doing. The name is meant to describe the way the horses behave. There is no following the tail of the horse in front. I found this to be 100% true. Adrian encouraged me to canter whenever and wherever I wanted. I felt like I was riding with a friend I had known for years. He has designed his own helmet (looks more like a hat but is of endurance riding standard) as well as his own saddle. SInce instruction is personal and exclusive, I didn't see him with any beginners but I am sure he would be brilliant with them. Everything about this half day was brilliant. And safe. I would recommend this to anyone who ever thought they might like to try riding and equally to riders looking for improvement, or maybe just looking for a ride in a big park not far from the big bustling city."

I can not recommend this highly enough - if you are in BA and like horses you simply must do this - I still can't get the smile off my face!Why is this such an amazing experience:*It's actually horse riding, NOT just following the horse in front of you on a set trail, with set intervals, being told when you can trott and canter. Adrian, the owner, lets you go when you want and do what you want. I have never been on a commerical horse riding experience that gives you so much freedom* The horses are really horses, not trail ponies that have been doing the same thing each day for the last 10 years. Adrian matches you to your horse when you arrive, so experienced riders can actually ride a good horse that still has a mouth and responds to the rider. I cantered to my heart's content.* Adrian caters for all levels. My husband came with me as he knows how much I like horse riding - this was my treat for the trip. He hasn't done much horse riding before and doesn't really like horses. Adrian was onto this straight away and worked with my husband to get his confidence up and learn to enjoy it. Adrian is such a good teacher, patient and makes it fun. I left them to it for 20 minutes whilst I went off cantering around the park and when I came back my husband was cantering (had only even trotted once before for a couple of minutes) and had a huge smile on his face. I nearly fall off my own horse! Apart from grumbling about how sore he his, my husband hasn't stopped talking about the horse riding since and how Adrian got him to feel confident so quickly.* the price is very good value for what you get - estimate the same experience would have cost about $400-$500 in Australia*The horse riding is in a national park, about 30 minutes from central BA. The park is very beautiful and as we were there in autumn all the colours on the leaves were changing - it was just heaven. You go to the park straight away and bascially have the full two hours there. Its not 90% of riding around a yard like so many other horse riding experiences I have been on.* Adrian is an exceptional person/horseman and instructor. He has a real way with horses and people and immediately you feel like you are riding with a close friend. His story is also very interesting and my partner and I found the things he said about life in general to be very insightful and inspirational.* Adrian also invites you try mate, which we were yet to try during our trip to Argentina, so that was an added bonus.* Transport is included and it was really easy to organise via email before we went on the trip.From our 10 days in BA, this is my highlight. I haven't enjoying riding horses so much since I had my own horses. We were both on a real buzz when we got back to our hotel."

I thought that I would be mad not to get a horsey experience being in Argentina, so was thrilled to come across the highly-ranked Caballos a La Par. I wondered if my time with them would live up to the flattering reviews. Let me tell you that it far superseded them.From the moment I got in touch with the company (run by the charming Adrian), I was impressed by it's friendliness, helpfulness and positive attitude. Nothing was too much for them.I got the transfer to the stables, which are set in the gorgeous green countryside and was introduced to Adrian and his assistant Hernan, over a cup of perfectly prepared mate tea. We talked about his business and how it specialised in offering personalised tuition, as opposed to vast groups (something which Adrian rightly prides himself on)I was introduced to the spectacular Tyson (sure enough named after Mike) and shown the ropes: how to use the reigns, break, turn, go faster, elegantly get onto the horse. Then Adrian and I set out side by side. He reassuringly told me what to do every step of the way - he was a extremely good, patient and encouraging teacher. We slowly developed into a trot and then a full blown canter, which was very exhilarating and great fun. And this is coming from a novice who has barely ridden a horse since I was a child. 0-canter in one hour is pretty impressive.We rode back (Adrian took lots of videos and photos, voluntarily, with my camera) and had a good post-ride chat over the most delicious pastries which he had brought (worth going just for them!)I ended up staying, experiencing the goings-on of the stables, and talking to Adrian for several hours. This demonstrates that this isn't a cash cow, rather a business he is passionate about and one which he really wants to give his customers the best experience with. There is no fixed timetable at all.It was an incredible experience - I really felt that I connected with my horse, who was immaculately trained. And I felt that I left with a friend in Adrian, who kindly drove me back to the city, which is 40 mins away.My advice would be not to miss this very special experience (one of my favourite, if not my favourite in my last five months of travelling in South America) - and learn to ride before learning polo (it is always best to learn how to walk before you learn how to run!)If there were six stars, the experience would merit them."

It is the overall experience that has me writing this review. As an airline manager who travels around the world seeking out authentic experiences, all I can say is that this is a home run. Send Adrian and email if you are planning to visit Buenos Aires and just do it \u2013 you\u2019ll be so glad you did."

Adrian (the owner) believes in truly individual service and attention, therefore he keeps his groups small around 4 persons at a time. You ride through Argentina's version of a national park which makes for a beautiful setting. There are plenty of wide open spaces in which Adrian let's you ride freely be it walk, trot, cantor, or gallop. The only restriction is your own abilities which will definitely improve by the end of your day no matter if you are a beginner or an expert. Adrian creates an atmosphere which makes you feel calm, comfortable and most importantly SAFE! All I can say is Thank You!!! DO NOT MISS THIS WHEN IN ARGENTINA!"

We had such a great time that I felt compelled to write this review straight away!From the minute we arrived we were made to feel very at home with mate and delicious pastries. Adrian was very welcoming and we spent the first half an hour just chatting and getting to know each other,Neither of us had ridden before but as soon as we mounted the horses we felt well at ease and knew we were in safe hands. After a little training and guidance we were on our way. The stables are located in a huge national park which was incredibly picturesque especially as the leaves on the trees had started to make their autumnal transformation...really beautiful colours. We pretty much had free run of the park and Adrian was patient and knowledgeable and knew exactly when and how hard to push us to achieve more. I was riding Indio, who had such a lovely temperament and was just as patient with me as Adrian was! By the end of the lesson my confidence had grown so much that I was cantering with no hands!I think what makes Caballos A La Par such a different experience is the fact that Adrian truly does love his horses, so much so that he's practically in tune with them and he's such a awesome person too. Riding in those gorgeous surroundings didn't hurt either!I would highly recommend this activity. Thank you to Adrian, Hernan (for his yummy mate), and especially to wonderful wonderful Indio, who I miss already!Dawn and Pablo x"

Adrian is a patient, yet firm coach. His love for horses was infectious. Indio was a kind and excellent horse. It was only my third time riding, but I felt like I had been riding for years. Visitors to BA, you are missing a great opportunity if you forgo this experience. Book in advance and plan to have an excellent time. Everyone associated with Caballos A La Par, including Jose, who drives you there, is just outstanding!!!Here is a short haiku to express my gratitude:Riding is much funThe Caballos A La ParRemarkable times!"

We arrived at some open ground for our lesson and spent a couple of hours under Adrian excellent tuition. Amazingly at the end of the couple of hours, which flew by, we were cantering with no hands!! which Adrian videoed on our camera so we have evidence for our friends at home.We both had nailed on smiles for the rest of the day.After a hot coffee and cakes Adrian dropped us back in town where we continued to talk about the fantastic day we had had for the rest of the evening.We loved Buenos Aires but these few hours were a definite highlight."

I had read some great reviews online, but was still quite surprised when we arrived at the park, and Adrian\u2019s first question was \u201cWhat do you want out of this day?\u201d\u2026 this day is going to be unlike any other horseriding experience you\u2019re likely to have had. There is no slow walking in circles, or following each other, or a particular regime- instead it is based on what you want and entirely personalized to your pace/style/ability/desire. I wanted to canter with the horses. Sure enough after a hour long lesson, in which Adrian made sure I had the necessary understanding, we were cantering and even galloping with the horses. It was an exhilarating day and fully met- and exceeded- my expectations of what I had envisioned. The lessons/riding takes place in a beautiful national park- which just envelops you in its sense of tranquility and endless nature surrounding you every side. We didn\u2019t see another person or a car on any side- at times Adrian would encourage me to ride ahead alone, so I felt like it was just me and my horse running through this beautiful nature. Adrian himself was a very friendly and kind person and a very patient teacher- we got along like old friends! .. and my horse, Indio, was a delight- he was so well-trained, and so responsive to my instructions that it made the learning so very easy!I think this is a highly recommendable activity - not just because you're in Argentina/Buenos Aires, but recommendable to go on your bucket list for life- go, do it!!"

            "review": "An Amazing Experience. I've never written a trip advisor review before, but this place really is something special.As others have noted here, Adrian's a very friendly guy with a clear passion for his horses and for teaching. His friendliness isn't just a bonus - it's an integral part of the entire experience of learning to ride with him. He wants you to feel completely at ease as early as possible, so that you're happy and relaxed - this makes it easier to learn but also, perhaps more importantly, to get in synch with the horse that he's picked out for you. This is important because all of the horses are extremely well trained, which means that they respond to the most subtle of suggestions. My girfriend thought that her horse was reading her mind, but actually she was just being really well taught by two teachers - Adrian and the horse she was on. I'm glad that places like Trip Advisor exist to report gems like this. Adrian only set up 18 months or so ago, and he's competing with large and established places (that have the backing of the large hotels) where big groups of tourists go to sit on horses and amble through the countryside. Our experience at Caballos a la Par couldn't have been more different, so it's important to point out why it's special.. Adrian never teaches groups of disparate people: only individuals, couples or very small groups of friends. He brings you breakfast, you get to know eachother, you drink some mate together and you talk about life. He's a great teacher so wil always adapt his style and approach to whomever he's teaching, but our experience involved standing on one stirrup and riding alongside our horses and cantering with no hands as he videoed our experience. We even had a nice lunch together afterwards.It's a very personal experience you get at Caballos A La Par: you'll leave with a friend in Adrian and a new found appreciation for horses (plus a real ability to ride them, Argentinian style).Couldn't rate this more highly. I tried, but 5 stars really is the maximum you can do. Which is a shame because this deserves 2 or 3 more: do it...."

We arranged our day with Adrian to give ourselves both a fun day out of the city (Buenos Aires) and an introduction to riding in Argentina (useful to those who have learned European style).Adrian exceded our expectations by providing an exilarating, fun and challenging day. A talkative and fun character, we were immediately treated like old friends. Adrian certainly knows his horses and his riding, and he looks to challenge his 'pupils'. He is perceptive of riding ability and confidence levels and he 'pushed' us just the right amount so that we rapidly improved in (what is to us) a new and easy style of riding - we were cantering free of our reigns within an hour! We were then tought tricks and stood up on our saddles. Adrian makes his sessions fun and engaging while being a firm and commanding teacher so that one's riding comes on very quickly.Adrian is a fantastic teacher to whom I would recommend riders of all levels wanting a fun new experience and to learn something new. His horses are all very well kept and trained, as well as well loved and this makes learning easy and quick! Whether you are a complete begginer, have ridden all your life, or are into polo, showjumping or any other equestrian sport, you will all learn something new in horsemanship from Adrian, whilst having a great time."

Definitely off the beaten track and a truly wonderful experience.I was picked up in the city and driven out to the country side where I found a warm welcome and three horses saddled and ready to choose which one i liked best. I was a little anxious because I hadn't ridden in over 20 years but with some extremely good suggestions I felt very at ease on the horse I picked. Driving alongside each other (a la par) and not in a specific track was great fun. I thoroughly enjoyed the environment (trees, flowers and butterflies) and the extensive ride.

We were picked up in BsAs near a metro station, and in 1/2 hr we were at the stables about 30 km outside BsAs. Adrian has good English and is friendly personality. The parkland was pretty and peaceful, the horses were patient, intelligent and VERY CLEAN. Saddles and all the paraphernalia was sturdy and of quality leather and other materials. They gave us half-chaps and helmet-hats with brims. It was seemingly long time before we mounted the horses, but I think Adrian wanted us to relax, or he was figuring our nature to later apply certain teaching style? Dunno. We shared mate and chatted for a bit. They took their time to perfectly adjust stirrups, sandle, etc. Adrian was not beating around the bush: he challenged each of us from the moment we mounted the horse -- but he gave praises as well, but no fake pity praises..His assistant, Kirsteen, a gorgeous Scottish lass with the sweetest personality was softening a bit Adrian's upbeat style with calm and attentive remarks on our position, reins hold, etc - -but also reflecting her own riding learning experience. In the end, it was a perfect blend of tough critique and friendly support from both of them. In about an hour we were cantering comfortably. Returning to the stables was most relaxing, and we randomly practiced different techniques -- and horses were now super responsive...or was it that we learned to lead them better after all? Adrian brought a pile of pastries and offered drinks and mate. My only cautious comment would be that Adrian needs to drive his car less aggressively. I highly recommend this experience from all other angles."

Adrian and his staff have an intimate knowledge of their horses, their equipment and most importantly how to help new riders enjoy the experience of horseback riding.

When I knew that I was going to be spending some time in Buenos Aires as part of my travels one of my priorities was to go riding. Having not been on a horse since I was a child (over 20years ago) my fear was that I might get up on the horse and immediately want to get off again! That was absolutely not the case with the beautiful horse Indio I rode under Adrian's amazing instruction. I was able to completely put my trust in Adrian and Indio and relax and more than enjoy the experience. It was fantastic and I still can't believe that in the 4 hours or so I felt confident enough to canter with and without reins and stand up on the horse. It felt completely natural as I was with a skilled and passionate teacher and such well trained and responsive horse. I felt an excellent connection with Indio and was very sad to leave him, the people and the beautiful surroundings.I am so pleased that I listened to all the fabulous and well-deserved reviews on here and made the decision to go riding again. The experience at Caballos a la Par has been one of my highlights in Argentina and I cannot recommend it enough. I am lucky enough to be able to stay a little longer here and have booked in for another lesson as Adrian has given me the confidence and desire to start riding regularly again.

Adrian chose to teach me how to lose my stirrup, continue cantering comfortably and regain it again without stopping. Later, I was doing a fast canter and I kept coming out of the saddle.

I saw the reviews for Caballos a La Par and thought it would be perfect to go horseback riding, given how long my husband has been talking about wanting to learn to ride. When he saw reviews for Caballos a La Par, he joked that reviewers on Trip Advisor made Adrian, the owner, sound like Jesus Christ. I laughed and told him to keep his expectations to a reasonable level. He didn\u2019t though, and he wasn\u2019t disappointed!I wish I had Isabelle Allende\u2019s gift of the written word to describe to you the experience. Adrian started his horseback riding and teaching company about a year ago. He will take you riding through the outer part of a national park that borders his ranch. Weekdays, the park is largely deserted which makes you feel like you are riding in a private reserve.Adrian took us through beautiful pampas, idyllic bridges and fields covered in beautiful tall grasses tipped with purple flowers. He said that he never takes riders on the same path, as he does not want to make his horses complacent. That\u2019s not too challenging either I imagine, given how the park (Otamendi I believe \u2013 but don\u2019t quote me) is 2,600 hectares large (yes, about 6,400 acres!!).He taught my husband and I how to trot, canter, and canter without our hands on our reins (is that the right word?) all in an afternoon. He also had these awesome dogs, one of which has (had?) no survival instincts as it\u2019s always chasing after the horses that in turn try to shake him off with a kick of the hoof.After an exhilarating afternoon of riding, Adrian took us back to and served us mate and desserts at his ranch. We became very endeared to him because he is just a great human being!! He is welcome at our home as a friend whenever he wishes to visit. We wish him blessings and much success with the future of his business. Do not miss the opportunity to experience Caballos a La Par!"

What made it so special is that although we were experienced riders 'English style' we were actually taught to ride Western style rather than just sitting on a horse and hoping for the best! The rides are through beautiful parkland but during the ride Adrian spends time with each rider and quietly gives one to one tuition.Adrian is a great teacher - very patient and clear in his explanations, so that during the ride we were cantering without reins, and even played around with some party tricks such as standing on the saddles which was great fun - it really took me back to my childhood.The horses are absolutely brilliant as well. Really well cared for, and not at all like riding school horses. Each has their own personality and they really do what you tell them to rather than following each other in a line and knowing when to speed up and slow down - the control is entirely with the rider.All in all a brilliant way to spend half a day - I just wish we could have gone for longer.

I was totally put off by tourist attractions as my friend and I are both experienced riders in the US. Well, I found Caballos a la par on this site, read the reviews and when I got here, decided to set up a time for a visit. Yesterday, we were picked up in the city and taken to the most wonderful park that is a Unesco Heritage site.. there we met Adrien Di Stefano, the director, and his assistant Sergio. These guys are the best. Adrien assisted us in getting just the right horse, and he wasn't satisfied until we were comfortable.. He gave Lisa his horse, a polo beauty, because she is very experienced.. It was not too long before she was jumping \"Gaucho\"... I followed along on Indio who was delightful. I have never had this much fun with my own horses.. we rode for over 3 hours in the park filled with eucalyptas trees and other beautiful vegetation... An hour into this lovely ride Adrien told me to drop my reins and start cantering. I thought he was nuts... but I thought I would try this, fully expecting to land face down on the ground. Of all wonders, I found I could canter fully around the field without losing balance, and with no reins, my arms flapping around to prove the point. Lisa was next, and yahoo'd the whole way around... then, I was told to take my feet out of the stirupps... I saw pending disaster, but Adrien was riding along side coaching me, and again, I was able to try this trick and it worked. What a lovely day. I just can't tell you how much fun it was to ride this area with your own personal trainer by your side who is congenial and supportive... One of the best days that will go down as having been completed in my bucket list... When we got back to the ranch, Adrien introduced us to the authentic hot drink called Mate, that is similar to tea, and very enjoyable served among friends. I recommend that you try this adventure. We left the hotel at 3 pm and returned at 9 pm enthusiastic that we had such a great time with Adrien.."

            "review": "Justifiable cliche - Words are never enough.... This was by far one of the best experience I've had in South America. I was wondering whether I had too high of expectations after reading all the reviews on trip advisor about Caballos A La Par and Adrian, but from the get go he made me feel at home. I've had four riding lessons prior to this one yes I was cantering without holding on to the reigns but more satisfyingly I finally got a grip on the correct posture, which at the end of the day allows you to fully enjoy horse riding and last longer on the horse without getting tired or sore. Adrian made me feel as though the whole Park was my own and indeed for the time it lasted it truly felt like it was. I really had a connection with the horse i was given, Indio and so quickly got saddened by the idea that I could only spend one day with him. I even enjoyed cleaning Indio as a part of that experience made me feel as though the horse was my own and i was taking care of it. The sweet pastries of all sorts and special mate was sensational! Adrian really trusted me with the horse, which immediately put a lot of confidence in myself, the horse and Adrian. I cantered without holding the reigns and closing my eyes! The day ended so peacefully and with a new found love for horse riding. Adrian pays close attention to you and reads his horses so well, which really helps the instruction and catering the lesson to your abilities and pushes them far beyond imagination.After some time in South America I was pretty much ready to go home, but after this experience I already started to dream of the day I would leave Australia to return to this amazing place and atmosphere! They say nothing is perfect, but in my experience this was. He owns an English Sheep Dog, my favourite, the day just got better and better. Please, do yourself a favour and check it out! I couldn't keep this review short even if I tried."

            "review": "awesome excursion from BA and the best way to learn horse riding!. My friend and I were total novice when it came to horse-back riding, and while we were excited to try for the first time we were definitely nervous. Adrian was really patient and understanding with us, and we soon relaxed because his horses were so well trained and totally under his control. Within 2.5 hours of our very first lesson, we learned how to walk, trot, and canter (even hands-free) all on our own! The entire lesson took place in a quiet, beautiful national park, and it felt like we were the only ones there.Adrian told us that some of his horses were rescued/bought out from poor conditions, which made the whole experience even more special. It was great to see his horses so clean (no flies around, really), healthy (shiny coats), and happy (mild temperament). For those wondering about gear, just wear long trousers & comfy, closed-toe shoes, plus sunblock. Helmet hat and chaps are provided. Adrian takes good photos & videos during the lessons, so feel free to leave your camera at the hotel. After most trips and excursions I get a \"been there, done that\" sort of feeling, but Caballos A La Par is a definite, rare exception. Even if I went back to Buenos Aires next week, I'd do this again in a heart beat and hopefully learn some new tricks!"

It matters not whether you are a novice or experienced rider, Adrian will cater the ride to you. He is patient, knowledgeable and passionate about his craft. The excursions are private so if you are learning to ride the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxed, no pressure from people you have never met. And when I say ride, I mean ride. You are not a passenger on these horses, you ride them. These animals are incredibly trained and respond to small, simple movements that Adrian patiently teaches you. After providing basic instruction and all the gear you need, Adrian guides you to a national park where you will explore creeks, pastures and woodlands. The countryside is beautiful and I recommend the evening tour as the sunset is spectacular. My husband and I are novice riders and we had no trouble. Adrian even taught us to canter the horses with no hands. At first I thought why would I want to do this, but after the experience it was amazing to see how small movements with my feet and body weight could direct the horse. The fact that this is possible is truly a credit to Adrian's abilities as a horse trainer. He is extremely accommodating, if Adrian feels you can master it, he will allow it. You feel more like a guest than a customer to this man. Everything is professional, from making the reservations to the ride to the socializing over pastries. Do not miss this experience!"

I'm an advanced rider but haven't ridden for a good few years, meaning my technique was a bit sloppy! Adrian was one of the best instructors I've experienced in my 25 years of riding. He sensibly wanted me to test the horse before taking him out. I was given the most amazing horse; gaucho who was absolutely beautiful...full of energy and raring to gallop, yet so responsive and well-trained and listened to me completely. Within the first hour, I'd done exercises to improve my posture and technique, jumped over logs in the wood and galloped from one end of the meadow to the other...amazing!! My boyfriend Paul who lives in Buenos Aires is a beginner and this was his 3rd lesson with Adrian. I was so impressed with his technique and confidence and couldn't believe he'd only had so few lessons. He was cantering without hands and cantering ahead of us without any trouble.The horses are so well-looked after and Adrian adores each in their own way. He showed us around the ranch and we got to meet his entire horse family, before eating our own bodyweight in delicious cakes and chilling out with a nice cold beer....bliss!"

They are very sensitive to the rider, and also are very careful. I have ridden a lot of school-horses before, and these seemed very different. They were interested in new riders, and seemed to enjoy being out in the park as much as I did. They also seemed to me to be very well taken care of, and in excellent condition. My horse was very eager to race, and seemed to love being out in the park! I was a bit worried riding on my own, but I felt very safe riding with the horses and with Adrian!! He is very attentive to the riders, and takes care to make sure that the rider learns technique and how to handle the horses even better. After the ride, I felt that I had learned a great deal, and was able to see my horse reacting better to my changes in technique!! The park and nature there is also extremely beautiful!! The area is gorgeous, and it is amazing to run through it on the horses, and it makes a rider feel very alive :) There are different types of terrain, and the rider is allowed to just goes as he or she sees fit throughout the park. I really enjoyed the experience!! There is no trail, and it is unlike anything I've rode on before. I definitely felt it was very unique to Caballos and was something I would remember always!!Adrian is also extremely nice! He was great to talk to, and is extremely knowledgeable about horses and all types of equestrian sports. He is a great person to ride with! We chatted beforehand, and also ate some pastries and mate together afterward. I thought it was a very perfect day, and really enjoyed the experience!!!!If I had stayed longer in Argentina, I would have definitely gone again!!!! :)"

This horseback ride is one that few will get to experience somewhere else, and much of the credit goes to Adrian. Adrian makes every ride a unique and personal experience. He takes you out into the open fields of Argentina and actually lets you trot and gallop with the horse, instead of merely instructing you to follow in line on a trail. He pushes you to accomplish what you think you can not, and in the end, you will find it to be one of the most rewarding experiences. Everything about this experience, the horses, the saddle, the ranch, and even Adrian himself, is extraordinary. If you are looking for a true horseback riding adventure, Caballos A La Par is the perfect opportunity."

Personalized riding in a beautiful pastoral setting only 40 minutes outside Buenos Aires. The horses were in tip top shape and every attention to detail was handled beautifully from the moment I was picked up at the hotel. The owner, Adrian, takes great pride in the quality of his horses, their training and care and the beautifully maintained grounds. Best of all, though, is the riding experience. Horses, side by side, not nose to tail. Galloping, cantering, riding free with the reins on the horses neck...a truly exhilarating moment for the horse lover. I would definitely book this activity again when I return to Buenos Aires"

I am what one could call a \"horse freak\", raised within horses in a different continent from the one I live in now, and I've been doing the show jumping thing for many years, yet always feeling it wasn't enough.For that reason, I've always wanted to experience different horse riding ways, which brought me to Ireland for example, and then to any horse riding place I could find just to spend some time with those animals I love so much.Argentina was the destination chosen by my parents to go and celebrate their 25th anniversary, and thank God they ain't people who count out the kids :)I'm 24 years old, but out there in the fields riding under the sun with a horse I totally fell in love with, I was as happy as a toddler on Christmas morning.Adrian came to pick us up at the hotel, brought us to the property which is incredible on its own, with so much green and fresh air you can't belive it's right outside the city. After drinks, some chit chatting and getting ready, we met our horses and were off to ride. My dad and my sister who rode with me are beginners, and both of them hadn't ever cantered before. They were given two small horses who looked like they knew their thing, and it turned out to be so: smooth, gentle, and perfect companions to learn new things. By the end of the ride, my dad and sis had learnt to canter hands off and were having a blast.I got a bigger horse, young and wide awake: he looked like he was in for some serious running around and so was I. Looked like we were meant to be.Adrian explained right away his goal was to have us spend a great 2 hours doing what we wanted to, while he helped with whatever we needed. I ran with my horse through this incredible park and not believing it, so fast and so good.All horses looked healthy and were let loose after rides to run around the property, till it was dark. Moreover, they were perfectly trained and responded incredibly well. On the the we rode, the weather was good but very windy: the horses didn't notice at all :) When we got back to the property, Adrian offered us treats, more drinks, and then brought us back to the hotel.AMAZING AMAZING experience, and I can't wait to go back. To all of you who love horses and are looking for the perfect ride in an incredible landscape, go there. You'll want to stay."

            "review": "Great riding in an unexpected place. My horse-crazy daughter had been living and working in Buenos Aires for about 6 months, and we finally decided to take a trip to Buenos Aires to visit her. She had mapped out our entire week for us, and insisted that we end our week with a ride at Caballos a la Par. She had been riding there throughout her stay in Argentina and had raved about it the whole time, but we didn't really pay too much attention to her since there hasn't been any time or place where she didn't want to ride.We were picked up on-time and taken to the stable, about 30 minutes away from the city. The stable was a nice change from hustling Buenos Aires, quiet and green, a nice change. We waited a bit, and enjoyed the nice weather while Adrian (the owner) finished up with another guest who had ridden earlier. We observed the horses too, and they were all very healthy and happy.After a few minutes, Adrian came out and we got ready to go. My husband and I rode two very pleasant, soft-mouthed, responsive mounts. They were truly wonderful. We have vacationed at a Colorado dude ranch for about 12 years in a row, and while their horses are nice, Adrian's mounts were truly exceptional. They were quiet and very well-behaved, smooth, and responsive. They didn't flinch when we encountered bikers, small children - nothing phased them but they would ease into a canter with the slightest pressure, and would slow down just as politely . Our daughter, an experienced rider, was delighted with her usual mount as well (Adrian's beautiful and energetic polo horse), and would have taken him home in her suitcase if possible. We were allowed to ride however we pleased, and didn't feel hurried or pressured to end the ride or ride for more time than we wanted- it was just right. We got to do some special and fun exercies, and our daughter got the chance to do some more advanced riding, which we know she appreciates. After we got back to the barn, we dismounted and headed to relax after the ride. Adrian offered us some very enticing pastries (the best all week, although we'd eaten so much in BsAs that we couldn't even make a dent in the pastries) and some ice cold beer. We chatted about horses and the ride, and thanked Adrian for the amazing experience!We would all highly recommend this side-trip from Buenos Aires if you have any interest in riding. It may seem like a bit of a strange excursion while visiting a big city, but Adrian's accommodating operation is outstanding and you will not regret it."

            "review": "The ride of your life!. Adrian gave us one of the most memorable experiences of the year (in fact, of many years). My friend Leticia and I spent the week between Christmas and New Years in Buenos Aires together. When i asked if she was interested in horseback riding, she said \"yes, but I am a little afraid as I have never been on a horse before.\" I called Caballos A La Par, and spoke to Adrian. He explained that he was incredibly busy but if he had any cancellations he would contact me. The following evening, Adrian sent me an email indicating that a couple from New York had to cancel as they were still snowed in. Unfortunately, by the time I had responded, someone else who was also waiting had taken the slot. Nevertheless, Adrian said that he would make a spot for us on Friday afternoon (New Years Eve). Thank goodness he said yes, as the experience with Adrian turned out to be one of the highlights of the year for both Leticia and myself. Setting: Caballos A La Par is located adjacent to the Parque Provincial Pereyra Iraola between Buenos Aires and La Plata. We arrived at a quiet, peaceful place and were greeted by friendly dogs, many horses and Adrian's associate Sergio. The ride passes down a dirt road, into the forest with most of the time spent riding through knee high grass fields. We saw numerous birds and a rabbit (but no other people) the entire time we were in the park. The sheer beauty of the natural surrounds is worth the trip alone. Horses:Adrian asked some questions up front to determine our level of experience and after meeting us in person and assessing our size and temperament, selected horses appropriate for each of us. I had some limited experience 15+ years ago while my friend had none. I am outgoing and comfortable being in control, she is more quiet and calm. Adrian selected horses that seem to be appropriate for each of us. Leticia's horse was smaller and well behaved, mine larger and a little more willing to test me. Both were perfect. One-on-One Training:More background here. I managed a technical training company for years and found that while many people understand a subject, only a few can teach it, and even fewer can teach it well. Adrian is one of the most effective trainers I have ever met. He starts by communicating the basics of riding, watching how you execute them and corrects your behavior in a friendly but firm manner. When you have mastered one step, he then pushes you forward to the next one. The appropriate mixture of education, encouragement and challenge, varied based on the needs of the person, and his desire to see you grown and reach new heights results in you accomplishing things you might never think possible. That is a spectacular teacher. Breaks through Boundaries:Adrian demonstrates a keen sense of each persons capacity to do more and works to move you beyond your on self imposed limits. He focuses on you individually. Works with you individually and challenges you individually. By the end of our lesson, I had ridden around a 10 acre open meadow cantering at high speed without holding on to the reigns. LETICIA HAD NEVER BEEN ON A HORSE BEFORE AND RODE HANDS FREE ALSO. Adrian inspired and pushed us to do things we never thought possible. Warm, Person Touch:Throughout all of our communication, Adrian proved to be a kind, generous, person interested in knowing more about us and sharing a lot about him self and his life with us. We felt like we had gone riding with a friend, not some stranger we met on through the internet. At the end, we finished off the day with some wonderful pastries and drinks before sadly heading back to the city for New Years Eve. A New Years Eve we spent talking non-stop about how much we loved and learned from the experience with Adrian."

Popping over fallen tree trunks, racing flat out across a meadow of wild flowers, climbing up and down riverbeds and rummaging through bushes... and then strolling gently home in the evening sun with a big grin on your face to the waiting after ride drink and a sizzling BBQ...Caballos A La Par gives you an unforgettable experience on horse back and you will enjoy it regardless of your level and prior riding experience. Adrian will carefully select a suitable horse that you feel comfortable with and will take you for a ride of your dreams through the vast and beautiful national park on the edge of the ranch. Instead of spending hours in the arena repeating meaningless excercises, you will be taken straight out into the nature, where you will learn as you ride. As you gain confidence in yourself and your horse, the ride will become increasingly challenging, fast and more fun, until you find yourself racing across the open fields or popping over those tree trunks just as you always imagined!In short, this is a riding experience above simple hacking. It is a great way to spend an afternoon away from the busy Buenos Aires and relax on a trail ride, learn to ride and handle your horse outside on a hack, and just to enjoy the peace and quiet in the gorgeous park. If you live in Buenos Aires, you will want to come back! Riding is well organized from booking to pick-ups to choosing horses and hacking, horses are well looked after and good tempered and people are friendly and very welcoming.

After 10 mins with Adrian you feel like you not only trust him and the horse but yourself as well. It is really a testament to Adrian as a teacher to be able to get someone to trust themselves in doing something they are so unfamiliar with(standing on a horse, cantering without reins) in such little time.

We are already working for more than 1 year in BsAs and wanted to do something different in the weekend than hanging around in the city.And I can assure you that this is definitely something different. It was wonderfull just riding horses into 'the wild'. The park is really beautifull and peaceful. In the beginning it is not easy to ride a horse, but Adrian helps you constantly and give you tips on how to improve your style. It is amazing how fast you can learn and manage the horse on your own. After 2 hours it was fantastic to ride alone through the fields of the park. Adrian was at the back, so it was like we were riding all alone over there. Just wonderfull.Adrian is very friendly and always helpfull. he handles everything with patience and that helps a lot to be patient as well (important on a horse you never rode before).I can highly recommend this horse-riding expierence to everybody who is visiting BsAs and who is staying already a long time in BsAs and wants to do something else."

Adrian was a great teacher and really made us feel welcome on the ranch providing pastries and the best hot chocolate and coffee we have tasted in the 3 months we have been here! The ride in itself was worth its money as we were out for at least 2.5 hours and was very challenging for all levels. We learnt to ride without reins, stand on the saddle, even as a beginner i learnt to trot and cantor all within about 15 mins of leaving the ranch!! The horses had a great tempermnet too and were clearly well looked after. This should be a priority on everones to do list when visiting Buenos Aires. Lots and lots of fun out of the city in beautiful countryside. Highly recommended."

Head out to La Plata and spend it with Adrian, his team and the most wonderful horses. It is truly calming and relaxing and the countryside is glorious. Adrian is extremely welcoming and hospitable and a very able horseman. He provides riding at every level and is very patient and extremely encouraging with beginners -myself and Sophia! By the end of the day we were cantoring along the beautiful countryside. I highly recommend taking time out for this experience- one of the best, most memorable things we did whilst in Buenos Aires. It is 30/40 minutes by car or bus(129) from the city- Adrian can arrange transport too. We are still talking about the day.... -thanks again Adrian and also to your team. Susan and Sophia"

Our riding adventure with Caballos A la Par was AMAZING! \u2013 It was such an enjoyable and unique experience \u2013 that we all made arrangements to come back for a second riding adventure before leaving Argentina!! We contacted Adrian (who is the horse trainer and riding instructor of Caballos A La Par) by email, and we were lucky to find an available time to ride during our stay in Buenos Aires. We were a family of 3; my mother, she\u2019s in her sixties, my daughter almost 8 and myself 30 yrs old. We are all on a beginner level and have no previous professional riding experience whatsoever. What we do have, on the other hand, is a passion for horses and beautiful nature \u2013 and our wish to combine the two by visiting the Ranch in Caballos A la Par was indeed fulfilled. The transport from the city center of Buenos Aires (about 30 -40 min with car) was arranged by Adrian and is very practical. We felt at home on the beautiful ranch right away; the people and all the animals were so welcoming. Adrian is fantastic; he is so friendly and full of positive energy, he made us feel so comfortable! He gave us excellent equipment for safety \u2013 a hat that is actually a helmet and leg protectors. He knew exactly which horses to give each one of us, and provided very good instructions in the \u201cA la Par\u201d method and let us gets acquainted with the beautiful horses, before the riding adventure began. Adrian\u2019s horses are exceptionally well trained for beginners like us as well; \u2013 they are calmed, yet strong and happy and unbelievably helpful at the same time. Adrian and Kristy rode next to us and gave us helpful tips along the way. We truly felt safe. Adrian told us we would be surprised by how much we would improve over the next few hours on the horseback \u2013 and we laughed and only hoped it was true! Little did we know that all 3 of us, were able to control the horses and ride in a way we only had dreamed about before!! It was so wonderful and more amazing than I can describe with words \u2013 but I will try: The ranch is located by Parque Provincial Pereyra Iraola; a unique Natural Forest and Biosphere Reserve (proclaimed by UNESCO). So, we had over 10.000 hectares of green nature and lush landscapes waiting for us. No boring and restricted trail to follow there! We were actually free to make up our own way as we entered into the wild nature of green tall trees and big fields. This gave us a unique feeling of freedom and exploration, which I believe is so unusual and extraordinary in activities like this! Adrian told us that no two riding adventures are ever the same \u2013 and we could see he was right! When we found an open green field we started practicing one on one with Adrian, trotting and even cantering! We had so much fun! We took lots of pictures and Adrian filmed us too. (He gave us the films later \u2013 just so amazing memories to have). My daughter was so happy and excited that she was able to canter alone on a horse for the first time in her life and she managed to stop the horse as well! She was so very proud and so was I! Not to mention my mother, she blew us all away with her quick learner skills! She looked like a Pro! She said she was able to do all these amazing things because she felt safe at all times \u2013 so true! Adrian is not only a wonderful instructor and teacher, he also gives you trust in yourself and courage to do what you really are able to do! We laughed so much and had such a wonderful time that we did not feel the hours passing by! I will not write about everything we learned in our adventure because I want to leave the magical moments as a surprise for everyone who will visit Caballos A La Par\u2026After several hours of riding in nature, we returned to the ranch and Adrian and Kristy made delicious hot chocolate and Mate (my favorite) for us. The pastries tasted heavenly as well! We were so thrilled and enjoying ourselves so much that we asked Adrian to please find us another time we could go riding again before our departure! He was going to do what he could \u2013 and of course he did: so we spent our last day in Buenos Aires riding! We are so grateful that we met Adrian, Kristy, Sergio and their magnificent horses \u2013 these two equestrian adventures were beyond our dreams!I very warmly recommend visiting Caballos A la Par to anyone who has a chance to do so! We were a family of 3 generations, and we were given such a wonderful experience together- one that we will remember for the rest of our lives! - We wish you the same!!"

            "review": "Amazing, magical must-do horse riding just outside Buenos Aires. Not only is this the best thing I did in Argentina, but it's the best thing I've ever done!! To give some background, I had only ever done 1hrs horse riding on a trail before this. At Caballos a la par I was with 4 other friends of the same level and we had the ranch to ourselves. Having read the website and reviews of Caballos a la par I had high expectations - these were exceeded from the start.\u00a0We were picked up\u00a0by Adrian's dad\u00a0at the exact time agreed and driven around 45 mins outside of BA to the beautiful ranch, a little oasis outside of the busy city. Immediately we were greeted by three very friendly dogs and Adrian who was also very welcoming. We had plenty of time to change and visit the bathroom before we put on our leather leg protectors and cool cowboy style protecting helmets (which Adrian designed and had made himself).\u00a0Adrian gave a quick but very informative lesson on how to properly sit on a horse, hold the reigns, position your legs, start, stop and turn the horse. One by one we were called over to get on our horse. The horses were beautiful and in great condition (in stark contrast to some horses we rode in Mendoza which were skinny and very smelly!) Once on the horse we were adjusted and did a quick balance exercise - as much practice for us as for Adrian to see how we were with the horses, he really wants you to get the most out of the lesson and\u00a0obverved us very\u00a0closely throughout the day. Once everyone was on their horse, we started off down the road.As the website and reviews say, this isn't a traditonal horse trek where you just follow each other - the horses are completely at your mercy and will go where you direct them, so you quickly learn how to control the horse. Soon Adrian was encouraging us to speed up and we were trotting. We all received a constant flow of advice from Adrian on how to improve our position (again, very different to our trek in Mendoza where the guide didn't say a word and didn't care!)We made our way off the road onto the land (a beautiful national heritage site) where we were able to do our own thing a bit more. Adrian taught us how\u00a0to move around on his\u00a0specially designed unique saddles, to dodge any overgrowing trees.\u00a0Once we reached a big expanse of meadow we had all been trotting for a while and felt very comfortable - then it was time to learn how to canter!! Adrian gave us quick demo and took us off one by one - with Adrian's help it was easy and the most amazing feeling to be riding the horse like this so quickly!! He called out advice to us as he rode along side us - how to slightly adjust our bodies so not to bounce etc. The horses are so well trained that small body movements trigger them to do something else, so it's important to listen to every word he says!After we had all cantered we were elated and had time to take pictures of each other with our new found skills. However, Adrian wasn't finished with us yet - he wanted us to canter without reigns!! I was a little dubious but, again, with tuition it was really quite easy!! We then had about an hour of doing laps of the fields whilst Adrian filmed us and took group pictures (one of us standing on the horses!) and generally messing around, before heading back to the ranch.Back at the ranch we had more photos, refreshments and pastries. We sat and chatted with Adrian for about an hour about how he started Caballos a la par (an inspiring story) and about his teaching of local children and his family. We were picked up at 3pm and eventually driven back at 8.30, although we were welcome to have stayed a lot longer.\u00a0In summary, you have to go to Caballos a la par - it was the most magical and amazing experience, we were all buzzing from it for days! I even thought it was all a dream when I woke up the next morning!! Don't bother with any other horse riding, they're all touristy walks along a trail and a waste of time. Adrian has set out to create a quality learning experience and achieves that and a lot more. You don't have to go as far as we did if you are a beginner, Adrian will only push you as far as you'd likeyo go and is well aware of safety.\u00a0My lesson has inspired me to go on a horse riding holiday next year - I think I'm addicted!!THANK YOU ADRIAN!!!!!!!Rachel \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0"

We wanted to gain some riding skills rather than just a typical group nose to tail horseriding experience. We definately found the place at caballos a la par. We went for a 2 and half hour exclusive ride with adrian and I noticed from the start the quality of the horses that were well trained, cared for and responsive. . Safety was also a priority with adrian something unusual at times in argentina. Adrian is a fantastic teacher that gives you great confidence and speaks english which is even better. I was a beginner and a little nervous but within a short period was feeling confident and could not believe I was cantering by the end of the ride. The scenery was beautiful reminding me of australia in parts. We have been on a few trail rides in the past but this beats any ride we have had hands down! If you are looking to improve your skills and learn how to ride argentinian style in great countryside - this is the place. He also serves great coffee and cakes. Best ride my husband and I I have ever had and heaps of fun at same time. If you don't believe me look at the photos."

            "review": "Definitely the best part of my two week vacation in Argentina!. I spent 15 days in Argentina, going to the Iguazu Falls, Salta and Jujuy and, finally, Buenos Aires. My one-on-one horseriding lesson with Adri\u00e0n fell on day 13. A friend of mine asked me just before I left which part of Argentina had been the best for me. My response? Until Caballos A La Par, my favourite part had been the beautiful scenery in Northwest Argentina, but the fantastic five hours or so I spent with Adri\u00e0n (including the drive to and from Buenos Aires) had squarely catapulted Buenos Aires into the lead. That's how good it was.I had never ridden before, unless you count the ride I had being led by a gaucho just a few days before my lesson (and I don't), so I didn't have any expectations as to what I'd end up learning from this lesson. When I met Adri\u00e0n at the pick-up point, he told me that I had to trust in him, and that he wouldn't ask me to do something he didn't think I could do. It's very easy to trust Adri\u00e0n; he's patient, gives clear instructions, and has a very reassuring, and, most importantly, honest air about him. If he says you're doing well, it's because you are. And I'm not just saying that because he told me I was!During the three hour-ish lesson, he taught me how to control a horse, canter, canter without using the reins, all while either riding side-by-side or even riding ahead of Adri\u00e0n. After my first few successful reins-free canters with my steed, Indio, Adri\u00e0n asked if I wanted to switch to Caramelo, Adri\u00e0n's horse, a horse, I might add, which is considerably bigger than I am. I'm not one to turn down a challenge, so I switched, and, man, it was very different, but, nevertheless, still a lot of fun. It was such a thrill being able to apply what Adri\u00e0n had taught to a completely different horse.Of course, one of the best parts of this incredible experience was the part where Adri\u00e0n made me stand up on Indio. I was more than a little scared, but Adri\u00e0n taught me what to do in the event Indio moved (let's just say it's something I don't think any male would like to do), and I got me some pretty darn cool photos which bring a huge smile to my face whenever I see them.It's not just the lesson which makes this so great; it's also Adri\u00e0n's company. He's a great conversationalist and we ended up talking about a whole load of things. He also made sure I was well-fed, having bought a lot of pastries for the post-lesson chat, and made me a mean cup of hot chocolate (using real chocolate!). All in all, I had one hell of a time. I didn't stop smiling the whole time! I really wished I'd gone there earlier so that I could have returned for a second lesson before returning home.Muchas gracias, Adri\u00e0n, and I'm really hoping I get to go back soon."

My girlfriend and I spent an amazing afternoon with Adrian and his horses a few weeks ago which we would encourage everybody spending time in Buenos Aires, to both experience and enjoy.Everything was easily arranged with Adrian via e-mail before we arrived in BA, and Adrian promptly picked us up from our hostel on the arranged day. Driving down to the National Park (30 mins max), we were able to get to know Adrian, who impressed us with his passion for horses and the incredible story of how his new venture came about. He also reassured us novice horse-riders that we\u2019d not only be able to comfortably ride his horses but also be able to reach canter speed with them (and canter we did!)Arriving at his ranch, we were introduced to his amazingly well kept horses and told the basics of how to control them. The first thing that struck us, was the feeling that his horses were better trained and therefore more responsive to the horses that we\u2019d previously had lessons with in the UK. This made things a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable!The three of us spent about 2-3 hours doing various exercises with the horses in the National Park, from trotting to being able to canter with no hands on the reins! From walking through rivers, to bending down to pick our hats off the floor\u2026 while staying on the horse! You really have to step back and appreciate the scenery as you ride through the fields as the sun sets. We finished the day on the ranch chatting, eating amazing pastries, and drinking Adrian's special submarino\u2019s (hot milk with chocolate bar). The whole day is highly recommended, and it was one of the highlights of our Argentina experience!Thanks Adrian. Hope to see you again soon!Gareth and Sarah."

If you love and appreciate horses...enjoy the experience of riding in a beautiful place...value good conversation and companionship...this is really something you should not pass up. (I hope this doesn't sound like a travel agent's pitch, because it is not. This is the real thing.)My husband and I just returned from a trip to Buenos Aires last week. Truly, one of the best experiences we had was riding with Adri\u00e0n and his beautiful, gentle horses. We were picked up promptly in the early afternoon, and were on the ranch in about 35 minutes. Almost as soon as we entered the gate and were greeted with genuine hellos (and friendly eyes of the horses waiting for us), we began to feel at home. We spent the first part of the afternoon in conversation; getting to know each other and sharing our riding experience. I have ridden more than my husband, but neither of us is an experienced rider. Adri\u00e0n spent the right amount of time instructing on the basics of riding and getting our stirrups and reins adjusted perfectly, then we were off. We rode side by side (a la par) in the beginning, conversation blending with riding instruction. Adri\u00e0n was very patient, and made us both feel confident and competent within a short period of time. We were learning as we rode, but such a different approach! When the time came to canter without reins through a large field of tall grass, we trusted Adri\u00e0n and our horses when he told us to \"leave the reins.\" After that, we rode for pleasure; walking, trotting, cantering when we wanted, riding through plants almost as tall as the backs of our horses and trails with nobody else on them. We often returned to riding a la par and enjoying the conversation that came easily. We rode for about three hours, and then returned to the ranch.Our experience didn't end there, though. I petted and rubbed down my horse Indio for awhile after the ride (no complaints on either end there!), then we walked to a gazebo at the back of the property and had Quilmes and pastries and shared mate. We learned that mate is more than a beverage. It is to be experienced with friends along with good conversation...and so it got dark, and we stayed pretty late. When it was time to go, Adri\u00e0n drove us back to the city himself. We said goodnight, but we felt that we had made a friend in Adri\u00e0n, not just spent the day on a horseback ride.It is very apparent that Adri\u00e0n loves his horses. He is gentle with them, but firm when needed. He was an excellent instructor, but let us ride independently once he knew we were comfortable. What a truly great experience!"

You will not be disappointed! Two girls in our group of four riders had never been on horseback before and within an hour they were comfortable enough to relax and really enjoy the ride. First, you get all the safety equipment and several minutes of instruction from Adrian, the owner. He speaks English well and is very patient and encouraging. The horses are extremely gentle yet spirited and not the usual broken down nags you get at some ranches. Then you ride for 45 minutes through a lovely park with trees, streams and sturdy bridges that are part of a 24,000 acre state park. Then you reach a large meadow filled with pampas grass and one by one you are taught to canter and gallop. Then, unbelievably, you will gallop without holding on to the reins....(they are used to guide the horse-- not for staying on the horse-- anymore than hanging onto your steering wheel keeps you inside your car!!!) Then we posed for a picture on a bridge STANDING UP on the horse's back...that's how gentle these horses were...they didn't move a muscle! After the 2 1/2 hour ride you will have refreshments in a nice glassed-in gazebo with a fireplace for cold days. Pick up and drop off are prompt and included with the price. I used to ride a lot as a child and this was just as much fun as I remembered! Truly the highlight of my 9 month stay in Buenos Aires...I'll be back for more next week!"

I went with a friend recently to spend an afternoon horseback riding with Adrian and his team - and I have to say that this was the best part of my entire 3 weeks spent in Argentina. The ranch is about 30-40 minutes drive outside of the centre of Buenos Aires; Adrian organises a car to pick up his guests from the hotel and also returns them at the end of the trip (I think this costs extra, but your concierge at the hotel can probably check for you). For someone who speaks no Spanish whatsoever, this was a really big weight off my mind! The ranch itself is beautiful - there were around 8-9 horses that I could see. I was told there are usually around 12 at this site. Upon arrival, we were whisked into a conservatory, where Adrian introduced himself and offered us mate and pastries (mate is the equivalent of Argentinean tea - and it a very good experience to share). I was expecting to be in a group of 10-12 people for this trip, so was pleasantly surprised when we were told that the trips are kept to individual groups, so it would just be the two of us. We set-off after the rain stopped. Adrian is a very good teacher - showing us how to walk, stand-up, stop and balance on horseback (all very useful things for a beginner like me, who had never ridden a horse before!). The horses were also very well trained and very gentle (Sometimes naughty when they wanted to stop and eat!) When we had the basics down, we set off into the national park (which is beautiful!) at a walking pace. Before long, we got a clearing, where Adrian taught us to canter (and eventually canter without holding the reins - which on reflection is pretty terrifying! However, I'm really proud of myself that I did it - I never imagined that I could even canter on a horse!). We spent a long time getting used to the horses, letting them get used to us and practising the skills we were taught, while drinking in the scenery. Before long we had been riding for about 3 hours, and it was time to head back (it really does go very quickly!). When we got back to the ranch, we returned to the conservatory and had hot chocolate and coffee, and tucked into the pastries. We really felt very welcomed and enjoyed the day tremendously. My favourite part of the day (after the horse-riding, of course!) was spending time talking to Adrian and his staff, listening to the Spanish conversations around me and seeing a completely different world. My only regret is that I didn't have a bag that I could carry easily (like a backpack or a over the shoulder bag), so that I could carry a camera to take some pictures - that said, if you have to concentrate as much as me, you probably don't have time to take pictures! Luckily, Adrian is even prepared for that and took lots of pictures for us. All in all, I had a really wonderful day and can only recommend that you try it for yourself. I'd definitely go back next time I visit Argentina."

Adrian can come and pick you up in Buenos Aires directly if needed. It's a half-day experience. The ride can be either a private class or a ride with no more than 2 persons. Within 2 hours, even beginners like me can learn how to seat properly, manage the horse, trot and gallop. The great thing is that you are not mixed with people who have not the same level as you.... The price obviously depends on the activity, but it\u2019s rather good. And you even have a more-than-welcome coffee/tea/hot chocolate with pastries after the ride, with a lesson on how to prepare and drink Argentinean mate at the end.So, my advice : just go and have fun !"

Caballos A La Par is the only activity in the top 5 to garner all 5 star reviews.I not only am a horse novice, I am an old, overweight horse novice who was very nervous about even basic matters such as whether or not I could get up onto a horse without completely embarrassing myself. And yes, I too ended up cantering through pristine meadows holding on to only the air between my fingers.I\u2019m finding it very difficult to find the right words for this review. Although all the previous reviews are true, even when put together they still are not enough to convey the heart of what happens here. I feel like I need a better language. It--all of it--just swallows you up. It takes the sense you had of yourself when you arrived and scrambles it. It shuts off your brain while the rest of you frolics with nature. It bursts open your heart, and you feel a deep joy. And, when you return to the rest of your life, you may sense--as I did--that deep inside, you have been changed just a tiny bit in a way you never before imagined. And, even when in the middle of discordant events, you may notice that an ever-so-slight smile is rising up on your face. (I\u2019ve attached a photo. It isn\u2019t pretty.)"

I first went horse-riding 5 years ago on my honeymoon and had a terrible experience where the horse bolted twice and I almost came off the horse. Since then I vowed never to go to horse-riding again. My husband finally persuaded me to try one more time and I am now 100% converted to horse-riding (and have been twice in BA) thanks to Adrian. Adrian understood my fear of riding exactly and helped me step by step build up my confidence and ability. By the end of my first 3 hour lesson I was actually cantering across a field with no hands!!! And loving it! I could not wait to go back for more and my 2nd lesson did not disapoint either. This is not your usual run of the mill tourist trail ride. You ride amazing, beautiful, well-trained horses in an amazing national park setting 30 mins outside of the city of Buenos Aires. Great for the first time rider, scared rider or experienced rider."

But I know that would be selfish.As a person living in Buenos Aires I love to go outside the city and relax my mind a bit. After about 45 minutes by car you are in a great park bigger than Buenos Aires with all kinds of trees, people and of course us.Welcomed by Adrian and his staff, his 3 dogs and of course the horses you will feel at home instantly. This is not the normal estancia experience with docile horses that just go because the other horses go and that know the way.No this is an experience you will never forget. You'll need to work with the horses. After these few hours on a horseback you will know how to hold the reins, canter without holding the reins and lots more.After these few hours on a horseback you will have coffee, tea, hot chocolate or something else with some real nice pastry and a nice chat about the tour. As I am living in Buenos Aires I generally go horsebackriding in this park every other week. I think the fact that I return every other week to this place says enough about the experience I am having when I am there."

This gentleman, his staff, phenomenal horses, exquisite 5 acre grounds and lovely even-tempered dogs then proceeded to show us possibly the best three hours of our lives.After politely inquiring whether we wanted instruction \u2013 which we wisely agreed to \u2013 we set off to a nearby 10,000 hectare ecological preserve on our extraordinary mounts. With personalized instruction, great humour and patience, we learned in the first HOUR how to hold reins, establish a cantor speed, control speed, communicate with the beautiful horses, descend steep inclines, and full-scale gallop, with complete confidence and safety at all times. We haven\u2019t mentioned \u2013 yet \u2013 that the park has varieties of deciduous and coniferous trees unseen in North America, fantastic vistas, lovely trails and is removed completely from noise and pollution. It is tranquillity itself, and to do it on horseback, with confidence and poise, excellent instruction and such great camaraderie is not something to be missed.Extremely reasonable pricing. A 5-Star, must-do outing, capped off by fine Argentinian wines and delicious pastry and great conversation. You will fall in love with horses (if you\u2019re not already), revel in nature\u2019s magnificence and re-establish your faith that you can meet people who are sensitive, kind, brilliant and fun.Justin & JaimeMontreal, CanadaJune 2010"

After the lessons we chatted over coffee and pastries and Adrian's passion for horses and teaching clearly came through. I have nothing but high praise for Caballos A La Par.

During the ride Adrian will teach you in a very relaxed way how to improve your riding. Even beginners will be cantering in a short time. Each time you will take a different track, it is clear that the horses are not programmed to take one specific route and you just have to sit instead of ride (as is the case in some other places I have been). When you finish the ride there will be pastries and hot chocolate at the ranch.The horses are fantastic, the people are great. I absolutely love the atmosphere. I will be back lots of times!!!"

I had been on a horse when I was little, being led around in a circle, but had no proper experience at all. Adrian and Kirsty picked me up (I was the only one on a Sunday morning) in the centre of Buenos Aires and took me to the ranch which is about 30 minutes away. I was really nervous at the start of the lesson and the first task, standing up while on the horse, I found quite daunting. I got used to 'my' gentle horse Indio in no time, though, and through Adrian's great tuition, lots of patience and encouragement, I slowly started to relax. The park is beautiful and a really great place to ride through, making you feel very much at one with nature. Adrian looks after his students very well and is really good with (complete) beginners. The other members of staff are very kind and helpful, too, and the fracturas after all the trotting and cantering are a real treat. Once you're there, don\u00b4t forget the ranch's dogs either, they love a cuddle! A morning or afternoon at A La Par is a great way to escape the city and have a wonderful time during your stay in Argentina."

I have been to BA 5 times in the last year and wanted to do something different. My four other travel companions reluctantly agreed to accompany me. Adrian, the owner, picked us up and drove us the hour to his ranch. He really takes the time to choose the right horse for the right person based on age, experience, height weight, etc. At one point on the ride, Adrian switched horses with one of the indivuals when Adrian realized the person was ready for a more experienced horse.When we arrived he outfittted us with helmets and leather gaiters to protect our clothes. We started off trotting down ther dirt road and immediately I began to regret that I would have to spend the next 2 1/2 hours on a horse. It was painful. However, when we arrived at the first meadow, Adrian took each of us aside and taught us how to canter. One of my companions was in tears, because the last time she was on a horse was when she was 5 years old and she was nervous. Adrian spent time riding with her individually while the rest of us happily cantered along. When we reached another meadow, he taught us how to canter without the use of our hands. Admittedly, I was in fear and reluctantly did this. For the first time in my life, I was actually \"\"riding\" a horse. Amazing. The lady in tears was all smiles now. We rode for 2 1/2 hours total. The whole time, Adrian's employee Sergio was there to assist us while Adrian took time with individuals. When we returned Adrian had fresh pastries and hot drinks for us. The total time for this excursion was about 5 hours. What an experience and a true bargain. Adrian only takes a few people out at a time so it is important to book in advance. One of the best travel experiences I have ever had. I love to ride on vacations, but usually you get some poor horse, too many people, and irritating guides. Not so here. Adrian cares about his clients and horses. It was wonderful to get out of the sitting. I will make this de rigeur when I return to BA."

For me, he made sure I understood the importance of what he was teaching while praising me every time I did something well. Adrian had us cantering on Isabel and Indio in no time (without hands) and although I was scared at first, he rode next to me and held my hand until I felt comfortable. At the end of the ride, Adrian allowed us to help brush the horses we rode and feed them carrots before he offered us every type of drink including \"mate\" along with traditional Argentine pastries. We sat and talked and laughed as though we had been friends for years. We are a little soar, but it was worth every bit of it!! Thanks to Adrian, our honeymoon will be unforgettable!!

Not only do you get a great scenic experience riding through a beautiful and very large park about 30minutes outside of Buenos Aires but Adrian is a fantastic teacher offering advice on positioning & technique etc. I was offered the choice of 3 horses based on my comfort and experience which was a first, normally at this type of thing you get plonked on anything! The horses are obviously very well cared for and eager to work hard too, which was great. Adrian and his staff are all very friendly and you are well looked after during your time with him - from the right kit i.e. hats and leg protection to pastries and amazing drinks warming in front of a roaring fire after the ride! Adrian makes the best submarinos in South America (hot milk with a melted chocolate bar).I have since ridden in other parts of Argentina and they haven\u2019t been as good as Caballos a la Par.

Over 10 years ago I had my own horses and was a regular rider, yet in the last 10 years I could count on one hand how many times I have ridden.

It was fantastic! The horse I had was both safe and had spirit and speed when urged, a rare combination. The skills quickly came back to me but until I got my confidence back the horse was very safe and the more I demanded from the horse the more it gave. And Adrian is happy for you to do whatever it is on the horse that you are enjoying the most in the beautiful natural surrounds of the large park. These horses are well trained and extremely responsive, yet at the same time have a certain bombproof factor which means I would also trust them with a child who has never ridden.The prices were very reasonable and the pastries and hot chocolate afterwards a real treat!

I've always wanted to learn to ride properly but never had enough money to take classes so it seemed impossible to me to go beyond a trail horse (if you don't know trail horses are the ones that just follow the horse in front, know the trail and nothing you do will make them deviate from that route). I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived to learn that I would actually learn to ride a horse. It was absolutely amazing. We were taught to canter and it felt amazing to be able to lead the horse and tell him what I wanted and when. Most of the time is spent in a large park-like area where you are free to practice what you just learned or just walk around. Anything really is possible, you are in control. Adrian will also make sure to guide you and help you learn riding properly which was extremely helpful. Without a doubt it was the most fun riding I have ever done and I certainly wished there were places like this where I live. Also, a fun note is that after you are done riding you will be able to relax by the fire, drink hot chocolate and eat pastries and just enjoy yourself. I highly recommend this place."

            "review": "Awesome day away from Buenos Aires. As a life-long horse addict always dying to be in the saddle, when I saw the opportunity to ride in Buenos Aires I knew I had to take it! I have ridden several times in Argentina and Chile, and was expecting something similar, where the guides just get you on the horse and head out with little to no instruction on the ride. While the scenery was always breathtaking, the riding itself usually left something to be desired. The horses have usually done the trip a hundred times, and have the mentality of pack animals on auto-pilot more than that of a partnership between horse and rider, which is what riding is all about. This is what makes Caballos a la Par so special... Adrian can offer that partnership, which usually takes months or years to build and understand, to each rider who comes and rides with them for the day.I have ridden regularly since age 6, worked at several stables and 2 Dude Ranches in the Colorado Rockies, and ride whenever I get a chance. That being said, I can easily say that Caballos a la Par is a very special operation, and is THE best option for a horseback riding excursion that I have ever seen. I have been 3 times now, and each time have watched complete beginners who have never ridden cantering around like they had been riding for months. Adrian caters to all abilities and matches each rider with an excellent, well cared for, responsive horse. The park is beautiful and each person gets to actually ride freely; definitely not nose-to-tail sitting on a horse that's on cruise control!After the ride, the group gets to relax and chat over hot chocolate, tea or coffee and pastries (and a roaring fire in the winter!). Everyone is relaxed and happy from the wonderful day.I would highly recommend this activity for anyone who wants a true horseback riding experience. You will NEVER find anything like this in the States (I only know of 1 Dude Ranch that offers riding of this quality - but you have to commit to an entire week!), so if you are in Buenos Aires and are even slightly interested in learning to ride, or getting back in the saddle, GO!! You will love it!"

I had never been on a horse before and decided to check out Caballos A La Par to experience something new. The property is gorgeous with a beautiful gazebo in which you sit and sip cafe con leche or a chocolate after a lesson in the park. The staff in unbelievably welcoming and patient and by the end of one lesson I was confidently riding a horse!!!!!! You would be seriously remiss to come to Argentina and not visit this place...I seriously could not stop smiling. If you are looking for an experience outside of the typical tourist traps and want a true taste of Buenos Aires with all its warmth beauty and splendor you have to have to have to check this place out!!!! It is something right out of a Victorian novel and the attentive staff and welcoming atmosphere are unlike anything I have ever encountered.It is conveniently located half an hour outside of the city and they arrange transportation for you so you don't have to worry about finding your own way. Please do yourself a favor and spend a day at this ranch!"

I then had a one to one lesson for 2.5hrs (I expected it to be a group session) and although Adrian said I could stay as long as I wanted, I was a little tired for the exhileration.The horses are beautiful and really well cared for, the park is stunning and Adrian inspires confidence that allows you to push yourself to make the most of the day.A big thank you!!"

Picked up promptly from downtown BA by Adrian, an amazingly funloving and happy sort who put us all at ease and got us excited about the coming ride. The ranch is a well maintained and secluded down a long bumpy road but well positioned next to a giant park where you can go at your own pace and either walk, trot, canter or gallop to your hearts content. No set trails here... you are encouraged to forge your own path. Even got to jump a little over fallen logs. Pictures taken at every opportunity and... the best part as far as an experienced rider is concerned.... you get to switch up horses every so often to try them all out! It is awesome as as my first steed wasn't quite the go-getter that I wanted. The second one most certainly was!! Ride ended with all of us exhausted and happy and finished in a cosy atrium/yurt with roaring fire, coffee, submarinos (hot milk with a chocolate bar) and divine pastries. Ride back into town was quick and easy. Perfect day."

After reading reviews on tripadvisor we decided that riding at Caballos a la Par would be a better and less touristy decision than going to one of the estancias. We are so glad that we rode here and met Adrian and his staff including Sergio and Fernando. Everyone was very friendly and Adrian has impeccably trained horses. As someone who owns his own horse I can really appreciate the skill and time it took him to achieve this. I enjoyed it so much that I went back a second day and truly consider Adrian a friend at this point. His instruction was so good that he had people who had never ridden before cantering with no hands before they were finished. I would highly recommend this experience to anyone who is in Buenos Aires."

            "review": "One of the most memorable activities in Buenos Aires...a truly unique horseriding experience!. My wife and I booked this horseback riding trip based on the reviews here on Tripadvisor. We are so glad that we did. We considered doing a side trip out of Buenos Aires to an estancia or to Uruguay, but felt those would be too touristy. After contacting a couple estancias, it seemed like they were just for show and herded tourists around like cattle. Our experience with Adrian's Caballos A La Par, was the best of our trip. Adrian picked us up around 10:30am (30 minutes later than originally planned due to some car trouble, but he called us at the hotel to let us know, so it was no trouble at all and gave us time to get some breakfast). We drove out of Buenos Aires for about 25 minutes to the National Park. At the end of a dirt road, we arrived at a horse ranch that was absolutely beautiful. The horses and a few dogs roamed freely across this huge estate. Sergio, who lives on the ranch had already prepared the horses with their saddles upon our arrival, so we began promptly. We were provided leather protectors for our lower legs and helmets. Adrian does not combine different groups, so it was like we had our own private lesson. Adrian taught us about the proper position on a horse and stressed that the horses are not trained to follow each other. Therefore, we need to take control of our horses using our body and our energy (reminded us of the Cesar Millan \"the dog whisperer\") and get to know our horse. We were taught how to turn, slow down, and stop our horses with the reins. My horse needed more encouragement (verbal cues and some kicks to get moving, exaggerated movements to turn), while my wife's horse acted on subtle cues (verbal cues were enough to get walking). We started out on the dirt road then we turned into a small trail off the dirt road through a small stream and into a large prairie with wild grasses. There were no trails in the prairie or in the wooded area towards the end of the lesson. We were taught how to stand on the stirrups while the horse was walking. My wife had a hard time with this, but Adrian held her hand until she was able to do it on her own. Adrian showed us how to canter with the horse, then he asked my wife to try it first while I watched. He guided her through it 5 or 6 times until she got it right. Then it was my turn for Adrian to help me canter. In the meantime, my wife practiced walking, turning, and stopping with her horse. We cantered for longer distances together. Then we learned to stop our horses by using only our legs. Eventually we moved on to cantering with our horse without holding the reins, with our arms straight out to our sides and stopping the horses with our legs. We have little to no experience with horses, so it was a bit intimidating but very thrilling. Adrian is a very good teacher and he can be strict with his methods, but he is effective and always encouraging. During the whole adventure, Adrian snapped photos and even videos as he rode next to us.After about 1.5 hours of riding some asado (chorizo, ribs and salad) was already on the grill for us back at the ranch. We were also treated to some mate (which is a tea-like drink that all of the locals have, but strangely, we had a very difficult time finding a restaurant that served it. If it did serve mate, it was only between certain hours and despite our desperate search we didn't have any luck.) We really appreciated this, as Adrian explained to us the cultural ways of preparing, serving, and sharing mate with friends (which is much better than any restaurant could do).After this, we were driven back to our bed and breakfast inn. Horseback riding is a physical experience, so we were a bit sore the next day. We were glad we did this after our tango lesson and on our last day in Buenos Aires. My wife and I have travelled to many places and try to take in the local culture as much as possible (Barcelona, Mexico, China, Philippines, Portugal, Costa Rica, etc.), and this is the most unique and memorable experience that we had. Adrian told us that this is a relatively new project for him (only been open for a few months), but we surely hope he will keep everything exactly the same, as his popularity will surely grow."

            "review": "Experience to remember - the highlight of our vacation. What an inspiring day!Adrian is a superb host and teacher, and genuinely cares about his craft. Sergio, his right hand man, and superb rider and foosball player as well, was a delight. And the ranch itself was an oasis outside of Buenos Aires, full of exotic trees and birds.We were picked up at the hotel by Adrian (with my wife and two kids, ages 6 and 9). We quickly left BA behind and after almost a week of city vacation, it was the perfect tonic to museums and city tours.Adrian is an incredibly thoughtful person who went out of his way to personalize an adventure - what a treat for anyone who has the opportunity to experience it. As an example, as soon as we arrived, Adrian asked if we wanted a picture at the entrance of the park, and seeing a van parked at the castle entrance he drove onto a field where the van wasn't visible - to make sure we could get a picture surrounded by nature and the castle. He then asked if we'd be interested in going to a special park for the kids (where they can feed the animals) - it turned out to be only open on the weekends but he clearly was always thinking of how to make the trip even more special for his guests.As soon as we got to the ranch, our kids who love dogs (and miss theirs a lot), ran to play with their very patient and friendly dogs who were clearly loved and well taken care of, as were his horses - now that's a life that any dog or horse should want - and at least part of why he really is such a great \"horse whisperer\".We then had mate and Adrian took the time to show us how it was made and the rituals behind it (a tradition we'll definitely bring back home), which added to the rare authenticity of the day. He later showed us submarino as well (chocolate melted in warmed milk, which the kids loved). After a quick game of foosball, we were ready to go. In retrospect, I think part of that was so he could understand us better to match the right horse to the person, showing the care he took for both us and for his horses.We then put on mini chaps and his inventive protective hats, got on the thankfully soft saddles (perhaps all Adrian inventions?), and were getting ready to go. The kids were initially quite anxious about riding, but Adrian kindly and professionally led them to ride, and then quickly taught us to canter. He did this with four very different learning styles (I need quite a bit of continued reinforcement of good habits - keep those heels down! - my wife needed his firm insistence that she would be able to canter, our son initial calming and then encouragement as he started to canter on his own and quickly became more proficient than his parents - he now wants to learn riding when he gets back to the US) and our daughter cantered with Sergio making sure she was happy - which we all were.At the end of the day, they had each of us come back to the house and practice cantering with no hands on the smaller horse (even our 6 year old!) which gave us even more confidence. I should also mention that Adrian said ours was the only family that day (confirming that Caballos AlaPar - AlaPar meaning with individual attention - is a rare undiscovered find), and because of that he'd be happy to spend all day with us - which we were thrilled with since this was by far the best experience of the vacation - so instead of three hours together we left at 10:30 and returned to the hotel around 7 pm! By the way, I've never written a review on trip advisor before - but this day and Adrian are so special that they deserve to be much better known. I would recommend a day with Adrian to almost anyone - but especially for families, couples, or people who want a real adventure - and clearly it would work for all ranges of riders (as the other reviews show). So my advice is - please get out there and do this - it was the absolute highlight of our trip!!"

            "review": "The highlight of our trip to Buenos Aires. When we went to Buenos Aires, we knew we wanted to have a horseback riding experience, but were warned that many of the estancias were tourist traps. After checking on Trip Advisor, we decided to give Caballos A La Par a try. If you have ever wanted to ride a horse like a cowboy or a Gaucho, this is the right place for you. My wife and I have ridden horses many times before but have never taken a lesson. In addition, on all of our previous riding experiences, running the horses was discouraged. We never felt like the cowboys (or cowgirls) of old. Well this all changed this April, when my wife and I and two friends made the right choice and visited beautiful Caballos A La Par, just outside of Buenos Aires. When we arrived at the ranch, Adrian, the owner was waiting for us and made us feel right at home. You will never find a person who is better with horses or a better teacher than Adrian. He and his assistant, Kristy, made sure everyone had a horse that was perfect for them. He provided chaps, helmets (that looked like cowboy hats) and all the instruction we needed to control our horses. We rode for three hours and Adrian and Kristy were always there to instruct and encourage us as we flew across the beautiful fields in the park. He even took videos and emailed them to us back home. After riding, we had tea, coffee, sweets and a lovely visit with them. Adrian even drove us back to the city that night. It was truly the highlight of our trip to Argentina."

I found Caballos a la par (horses side by side) on Trip Advisor and after reading the excellent reviews, I thought I would give it a try. Boy am I glad I did. This is one of the best vacation excursions I have ever had and i've been on several all over the world. I took my 64 yr. old father-in-law and my 12 yr. old son, neither of whom had ever been on a horse, and we all had a great time. Adrian is a fantastic and patient teacher and his horses are very well trained. This is not a typical trail ride where one horse follows another in a train and you have no control. Adrian teaches you how to control the horse and you go out riding through a park in the Pampas side by side. If you want to walk you can walk, if you want to canter, you canter, and if you like to trot you can do that too.Adrian had both my father-in-law and my son cantering in about 10 minutes, it was truly amazing. The equipment and the horses are 1st rate and everything is done with safety in mind.After the ride we went back to the mini-estancia and enjoyed our first submarino (Argentine hot chocolate) while chatting with Adrian. It was a great afternoon and I highly recommend this activity as a nice break from the city if you have a chance.Some tips:- If you take the bus, plan to leave the station about 1 1/2 hrs. ahead of when you're supposed to meet.- BYODEET - The mosquitoes can be bad in the park on some days, especially if the wind dies.- Wear jeans or thick pants that you don't mind getting dirty."

Whether you are indifferent about horses or love them - you have never ridden the way that you will with Adrian of Caballos A La Par.The riding itself is great - you will be comfortable on your horse and within a short time will be cantering confidently through wonderful open fields. Adrian has designed special saddles, special helmets and has selected ideal horses for his business. His obvious planning and thoughtfulness combined with a stellar level of professionalism are impressive. However, what truly makes Caballos A La Par a five-star experience is the manner in which Adrian (and his right-hand man Sergio) transform nervous tourists into confident, comfortable riders. He is the type of teacher who obviously makes an impression on everyone he works with. His style, manner and the depth of his understanding of people and horses and how to motivate both is very unique.Our family of four including our 23 year-old son (who had previously ridden very little) and 11 year-old daughter (who had some previous \"pony lessons\") all had different levels of enthusiasm about riding for the day. We were all completely comfortable and very happy after only a short time with Adrian. We spent the day cantering through very nice countryside, had great conversation, laughed with each other and returned back to BA very excited about what we had done.Adrian was warm, thoughtful and very professional. His communication prior to our ride was clear. The price was quite fair. (Be sure to bring cash.) Afterwards we had great conversation while enjoying special coffee and delicious pastries. Our son played a very competetive foos-ball game with Sergio and our daughter wanted to kidnap one of the very friendly dogs who are part of experience. When we are back in BA, we will definitely ride with Adrian again. We couldn't recommend Caballos A La Par more strongly - don't miss it!"

            "review": "A Must-do When in Buenos Aires! (Long Review). I must admit, horseback riding in Argentina was not on my list of things to do when I was initially planning my first trip to Buenos Aires. I planned on having a relaxing time absorbing in a new city: eating delicious steaks, shopping along Florida avenue, buying leather goods,...all in all, I was ready to be a tourist.I went on Tripadvisor; read about the positive reviews about Caballos A La Par; and decided that I would email to find out more information. I must say, I am glad I took that first step and emailed Adrian (the owner). I have never ridden a horse before and am happy to report that my first horseback riding experience was awesome!!!At first, the plan was for me to take a bus out to La Plata, a city that is about 30 to 40 minutes outside of Buenos Aires. Since I do not speak Spanish and was traveling alone, I was a little hesitant about leaving the city. Luckily, Adrian called me the night before and told me that he was picking up another customer in the city and that he can provide me with a free ride to and from. Adrian picked me up at exactly 10 am the next morning. As I entered the vehicle, I met up with a very delightful woman named Christy (sorry if I misspelled). Christy is a colleague who currently works for Adrian; she speaks perfect English. On the ride to La Plata, I really got to know Adrian and Christy not as tour guides or operators; but I got to know them as people who are simply passionate about what they do. Adrian loves his work as a horse riding instructor and Christy is a travel fanatic (she has traveled throughout Asia, Africa, and Europe). Also in the car was another customer, a friendly guy from Spain who is temporarily living in Buenos Aires.Although the weather forecast indicated that it will not rain until later in the day/evening, the rain started trickling in once we arrived at the ranch that morning at about 10:45 am. My heart sank as the realization of not being able to ride a horse loomed. Adrian suggested that we enter shelter, eat some pastries that he brought, and wait for the rain to pass. With my fingers crossed, we did so. This is where Adrian and Christy introduced me to mat-e (an Argentianian drink similar to tea), but that's another story. About 45 minutes later, the rain stopped,...my best adventure began...You are first asked a series of questions about your riding experience and personality. I later found out that this is done so that you will be matched with a horse that fits your skills and temperament. Then, you put on a cowboy type hat with a knob in the back that adjusts to the size of your head. I naturally have a big head, so I didn't need to turn the knob much. Thereafter, you put on these leather straps around your shoes. After the gear setup, you will be asked to climb the horse that Adrian hand picks for you. Adrian gives you a summary of how to: (1) get the horse to move, (2) make the horse turn right or left, (3) slow the horse, and (4) stop the horse. To be honest, I was a mess,...as I am one of those people that needs to over-analyze and study things before I feel comfortable enough to actually do it. Surprisingly, my horse had excellent manners and before I realize it, my horse and I were moving as one. We leave the ranch and head toward the park...I am a high school teacher, so I recognize a great teacher when I encounter one. Adrian is a great teacher because he is patient with you (I am a slow learner), he encourages you, he motivates you, and he compliments you when you earn it. What I appreciate most about Adrian is that he challenges you, without pushing you. He treats you like a student, not a tourist.Through Adrian, I learned how to understand and appreciate horseback riding. I learned how to gallup and cantor..., cross a stream on a horse, learned when to lean forward and when to lean back when a horse is climbing up or down a hill,...the list goes on and on...After about 1.5 hours of riding, it began to drizzle again. Most tour operators would have ended the experience and taken your money, Adrian and Christy continued onwards....they cared that I received the best experience,...and I did. Even with the rain, the horses were well-mannered and never nervous. The entire experience was well over 2 to 3 hours. Christy also shares with me that they intentionally take a different route on each tour so that the horses do not become complacent and programmed. The horse heeds to the rider -- you are controlling the horse, the horse is not controlling you.Intermittently, while Adrian is teaching my fellow horse rider from Spain, it was nice to have Christy also ride along to reinforce the skills I recently learned from Adrian. Christy filled in the knowledge gaps and also provided me with extra tips -- I felt like I was getting twice as much lessons within the 2 hour time period. I highly recommend someone who is looking to try something new in Argentina to try Caballos A La Par. Adrian and Christy are genuine people who loves what they do. For those in doubt, I hope that this review will motivate you to give it a try; I am confident that you will be glad you took your first step/gallup."

We are 50-something parents of a 13 year old. Whenever we travel I try to give her the experience of riding but until Caballos A-La-Par she had never experienced the feeling of freedom and connection with a horse, cantoring in a open field.My husband said he would go with us but would not ride. Too many visions of American stables with their tired and moody horses. When we arrived and saw these beautiful horses waiting freely and patiently in a field, he agreed to ride. Adrian fitted my daughter and I with his ingenious half-chaps (foot to knee) and insisted my husband wear his own person full chaps (my husband had worn shorts).Adrian is a man honest to himself and others. He chose to leave the corporate world and pursue his passion of horses. This passion manifests itself in every detail of this riding experience, not the least of which is his partnership with his horses. He and his horses are supreme teachers. Adrian is skilled, insightful, encouraging and patient. The horses are equally patient, calm and responsive to riders of any ability.The park was beautiful with open fields, forests, creeks and not a sound other than nature. We had a a magnificent day riding. I agree 110% with all the positive reviews here, but I must tell you more about my experience, in the hopes you too will visit and experience the people and horses of Caballos A-La-Par.When we returned to the ranch from riding, I realized I had forgotten to take my allergy medicine. My family was fine, but with just 2 or 3 bug bites I began developing hives. Adrian had me cool my arms in water and drove us back towards Buenos Aires. Minute by minute the hives grew worse and spread (again....my fault for not taking my medicine). By the time we got to BA I was beginning to panic. Adrian, the teacher, calmed and reassured me. He drove us to a pharmacy, where they gave me medicine and told me to get to a doctor ASAP. I really began to panic while Adrian, again calmed me and took me immediately to a private doctor. He waited with my family in the office while I received a cortisone injection. Within the hour my hives began to disappear. He would not leave until he made sure that I would be fine!I think about what could have been a horrible ending to a dream day; trying to find a hospital, trying to communicate, hoping to get the right medication. Adrian's kindness, calm and concern saved the last 2 days of our vacation, and turned what could have been a disaster into a mere inconvience."

The countryside is beautiful and you would never think that it was possible to feel so remote only half an hour's drive from the city. Adrian, the owner is a fantastic teacher and will have you cantering easily in no time. More than a fantastic teacher though, he is also a warm and friendly host with a great sense of humor. I had a great time getting to know him and the others who came to ride that day (mostly BA locals) in a very laid-back atmosphere. I will definitely be back and would recommend this experience to anyone, no matter what your riding experience or age or background. You can personalize your day however you like, according to your schedule and interests. In addition to the fun of riding in a gorgeous natural setting, it's a unique way to experience Argentine culture in a much more authentic way than most tourists would have an opportunity to."

The ranch is quite small and the atmosphere is very friendly and you can really tell that they love their horses. The surroundings were amazing and perfect for horseback riding. The horses were very well trained and Adrian, the owner that took care of us, is a very good teacher both for skilled riders and beginners.I highly recommend this place and I'm going back next week!Venke, Sweden"

First of all, the location is only 30min from central Buenos Aires in a beautiful parque natural where you ride in the woods and on open fields. You can also tell they really love their horses that all are in exellent shape and very well ridden. If you want, you get professional riding tips from the owner Adri\u00e1n, I really felt I learned a lot in just 2 hours!

My circumstances were odd, but I had to go. Start of the Day: \"This is how you hold the reins.\"End of the day: I was ?cantoring? which is one step shy of a full gallop! My \"riding style\" was analyzed, video taped (after my approval) and corrected. I'm not talking about weeks or months of riding, we're talking one day. The owner Adrian is a horse whisper, I swear. Every time he wanted me to cantor the horse would start cantoring. Impressive. I feel like I know what I'm doing on top of a horse!Beautiful fields and scenery. Who would have thought you could experience the country side so close to such a massive metropolis?Very creative and in depth teaching techniques. Class A service, you feel accepted and welcomed into the Argentine countryside! These guys are no joke."

The hotel had a daily flyer of attractions and I noticed the mention of horseback riding in a park only 30 minutes from the hotel. I jumped on the idea and the concierge made the arrangements for that very afternoon. When we arrived, we were immediately made to feel so comfortable and welcome by Adrian. He made sure we had the horses suitable to our level of riding and off we went to a fantastic park in Buenos Aires. He gave us each personal attention and in his unique and friendly way, he was able to actually combine the riding with low-key instruction to help us be better riders. And we were! After two hours, my boyfriend was cantering on his own through the forest and I was galloping across the flat ground with no hands! The horses, of course, are EXQUISITELY trained, very responsive, yet calm and trustworthy. I found I was actually more comfortable with the horse I was riding than either of my own two horses I have at home! The park that we rode through was amazing - I had no idea there was so much land that close to the city and Adrian knew all the right places to take us. Afterward we relaxed on his beautiful property and took some photos which will be keepsakes for me forever!I highly recommend Caballos A La Par to anyone interested in seeing a beautiful park while riding fabulously trained horses with a kind and personable guide and instructor. It was a once in a lifetime experience!Thanks, Adrian!Debbie from Washington, DC"

I was staying in Buenos Aires for three weeks visiting my father and since I like horses and love seeing nature, I decided to find somewhere where I could go horsebackriding. I found the homepage for \"Caballos A La Par\" and got more and more interested the more I read. They had all information available in english (good for me when I don't speak spanish) and it seemed like a place that would fit me. And WOW, what an experience! Their place where not far away from Buenos Aires, me and my father took the bus for about 45 min and then Adri\u00e1n from Caballos A La Par picked us up. I hadn't been riding for a while, though I've been riding a lot when I was younger, and I was really looking forward to this event. And I must say - I couldn't imagine what an amazing evning I would have! Adri\u00e1n was a perfect host - I've never met a person as kind and hospitable as Adri\u00e1n, we felt welcome from the beginning. After some traditionally mate and some pastries, we would start the riding trip. From the very beginning I noticed that the horses were very well-trained and attentive. The tour was all amazing, I can't describe it since I don't have all the words for it. The surroundings were wonderful, we were riding in a huge park and we didn't meet any other people. It was a very beautiful and calm place. Adri\u00e1n was a very good rider and an excellent teacher. I found myself very comfortable during the whole trip. I haven't learnt that much about horses and riding ever before. It was very varied both the environment and the riding. We were supposed to be out riding for approximately 2 hours but we weren't back till more than 3 hours later! We had a lot of fun, and I think the horses had as well. I did even try changing horse as they're doing when playing polo! Jumping from one saddle to another, that was great fun! Adri\u00e1n was very keen about me having fun and I really had. He really made me dare doing a lot of things I didn't know I could, and his joy and love for the horses really got me. After the riding, we had some more beverages and pastries and then Adri\u00e1n drove us all way back to Buenos Aires. By then, we had been there all the evening and hadn't noticed that the time passed by. We had a lot of fun!This was my best experience of horsebackriding ever and I strongly recommend you to visit Caballos A La Par. It's personalized, they arrange the event just as you want it, and they really enjoy giving you a great experience. Thank you Adri\u00e1n and Sergio that made my stay in Buenos Aires such a great stay, I hope we will meet again someday (and that we could play polo!). Good Luck with everything, I wish you the best!Lots of love,/Linnea"

            "review": "Best horse riding ever near Buenos Aires!!!. My girlfriend and I had been to several estancias in Buenos Aires where we had been sitting on some horses but not much more than that! However, at Caballos A La Par we really have had several wonderful experiences. First of all you just don't sit on the horse, you truly learn how to ride a horse. After the first time we visited Adrian, we both were already completely comfortable and able to manage the horses. A couple of weeks ago our family visited us here in Argentina and we really felt we had to share Caballos A La Par with them and so we did! After a 2-hour ride, they all left Caballos A La Par with great enthusiasm and all being able to really manage and ride the horses. They all returned completely surprised since they had never expected themselves to be horse riding as such, especially not after their first horse riding experience.Second is the diversity Caballos A La Par has to offer. You never take the same track and each ride you experience new things, or in horse riding or in the beautiful surroundings. Adrian and his crew are really able to offer something complete and special.Furthermore, one very nice aspect of Caballos A La Par is that you can go there throughout the whole year! In winter, spring, summer or fall, Caballos A La Par is an activity to be recommended throughout the whole year. In the winter, after a good 2 or 3 hour ride, Adrian prepared the best hot chocolates with 'medialunas' and in the summer we enjoyed with a big group of friends one of the best 'asados' after a beautiful trip. Just spoke to Adrian, made an appointment and we are meeting him again tomorrow! Already looking forward!"

I am an avid horseback rider and have been to many \"horseback riding places to ride\" in and outside the US while on vacation and Caballos A La Par is the best. Our adventure started with Adrian, one of the owners, coming to pick us up from our apartment in Buenos Aires, this made for a headacheless day. Upon arrival we were treated to delicious pastries and were introduced to our horses. My boyfriend is not as experienced as I am, but after some great instruction from Adrian and him getting more comfortable on his horse, he was riding like a pro! Adrian even got him comfortable cantering, something he hadn't done since he was a kid! Our ride all over the park was roughly 3 hours, I didn't want it to end!! The grounds are beautiful and the horses really listen to you. On our return, we were treated to Mate and then it was a US vs. Argentina challenge of Foosball. The day was lazy and the weather as ideal, nice and breezy. Sitting on the lawn chairs and look at the landscape with the horses munching on grass was the perfect end to our time in Argentina. If you know how to ride, want to learn to ride or brush up on skills while seeing a side of Buenos Aires you never thought existed, you must visit Caballos A La Par. Adrian truly loves his horses, his job and has a passion to teach and make riding a fun experience for all levels. I will definately return."

One of thee most memorable riding experiences I have ever had...the stunning ranch \"A La Par\" and is the brainchild of Buenos Aires local, Adrian.Set in the proclaimed Unesco site of Pereyra Iraola Provincial Park, A La Par (meaning side by side) enjoys privileged access to 10 000 hectares of beautiful mature woodlands 30 minutes from Buenos Aires. Adrian's aim is to share his passion for horses...he offers a unique riding experience which is tailor made for all guests, tourists and locals alike and his concept really does buck the trend.After meeting up in town, I headed out with Adrian to spend a day at A La Par and see for myself why this ranch is becoming a 'must do' in BA. It was evident to me within minutes of arrival and watching Adrian around his stunning Arabian horses, and indeed how they behave around him, that Adrian has a gift. We spent the day walking and galloping through stunning countryside and stopping half way through for a lunch stop to let the horses rest. Adrian has incredible patience for teaching and instills so much confidence even in the most nervous of riders. He was the perfect host and even went off to get me mosquito repellent after I had been bitten badly.The ranch is certainly like no others I have been to in my 3 previous trips to BA and I only wish I has known about it sooner!Words actually fail me to even begin to describe my day at A La Par and what I have learned, even as an experienced rider. Aware that I would love to learn polo, he even taught me how to improve some essential balance techniques. Late afternoon, Adrian offers me some yerba mate, (herbal drink), a daily ritual for Argentinians. Around sunset, Adrian goes over to his horses to say goodbye to every one of them. It's emotional watching because it's as if the horses don't want him to leave.Wow, a day in paradise!"

            "review": "WOW..The best day outside of Buenos Aires!!!. In short: I can't tell how satisfied,excited and inspired i felt after spending a day riding Cabalos a La Par. I went few days later again and brought my brother in law with me and we both had a blast again. The nature, the horses and the owner of the place made our day one unforgettable experience. Firstly, the place you ride is magical. It is a park -Parque Provincial Pereyra Iraola - between La Plata and Buenos Aires. The park is a mix of tropical jungle and argentinean pampas, trekking valleys on the bottom of in the White Mountains and wheat fields in Eastern Europe (i am Bulgarian leaving in US who spent some time in India and South East Asia::-). It is simply incredible that 45 minutes from Buenos Aires i was able to be in such a beautiful place. It was so green and lush that it made me forget the hustle and and the traffic of the city. Walking there would have been very pleasant too. Secondly, the owner/guide Adrian is a great guy who puts a lot of effort to make your experience pleasant and makes sure you learn to ride the right way while you \"persue Apacchi\" dreams:-).I am a person who is always in a hunt of the adventure and the action. Riding Pincho (the name of my horse) I felt like a cowboy or explorer or an american indian looking for bison tracks in the mud. I forgot to mention that I was an absolute novis in horse back riding but after one hour of hearing\" Back Straight\", \"Relax\", \"Don't Pull\", \"Heels down\", \"Kick\", etc:- I was actually galloping. Adrian was with me all the time and I thank him for the patience with my irrational moves at the beginning. Thirdly, the horses don't know the road and don't follow each other which was very important for me to learn how to control the horse and to make him go the way I want and the pace i want. I don't know if that was because of how they were trained or something else.What is most importantly I think is that Adrian is very passionate about what he does and is very hospitable and genuine person. The saddles we used were custom made for his horses with some additional improvements that make the saddle more comfortable for both the horse and the rider. He was not able to explain to me exactly what he had improved but he was very proud of his invention and I could tell that after 3 hours of riding i did not feel as bad as i expected. The same applies to the hats that we were wearing-they were his idea too. They look like cowboy hats but were made of helmet like material so you had the look of a cowboy:-) and in case you fell you would be protected. They had an adjustable plastic strap which made it very comfortable to wear. He said that he invented it but said he has no interest in making hats-he loves his horses:-). Most of all he didn't take our trip as one of the next business transactions where we were clients and he was the service provider interested in getting his money. He went out and beyond to make sure we feel like home and feel good. Very often when i am using the services of a guide or a company for anything extra i need to pay or you are put in awkward and uncomfortable situation. I dont mind paying for anything i receive. Don't get me wrong.But for example I went to a Boca game through a company that my hotel suggested for which i paid 6 times more then the face value of the ticket. The explanation was that the game was sold out and that they had to use some member's tickets and in addition after the game we would be taken for a dinner. Well..after the game they took us to a cafe next to the stadium where they gave us a cup of soda and one slice of pizza or a sausage. One guy was very hungry and after the pizza he asked for a sausage but they told him that he could only pick one or the other - a slice of pizza or a sausage. He could not have both. So he had to by the sausage for 10 pesos! Ha!With Adrian we rode 3 hours instead of 2 becasue i wanted to practice more, we played table soccer together, my brother in low used the shower in the ranch to refresh after the ride, Adrian arranged for our transportation back top Buenos Aires with friends of his, he picked us from Buenos Aires on the second day with his car, and he drove my sister to the best leather shopping store in the city where locals shop! No more comments about the guy.... When i went to the ranch I met a very pleasant German family part of a group of advanced riders group training their (actually the husband was argentinean who moved to germany and then moved back to BA). Their 8 years old daughter was training there too and she was a real pro. She was a nuturally born jokey. At some point se stood up on the horse which made her mother little nervous but she just laughed jumped back on the saddle, turned the horse as if she was turning on her heels and rode ahead. Amazing!After the ride was over Adrian took us to one of the parillas on between La Plata and Buenos Aires where locals go. The food was excellent and the beer cold! For 90 pesos the tree of us gained all those calories back:-)I don't want to compare Cabalos a la par to the well known estancias. I did not go to an estancia. I did get in touch with few estancias though and my impression was that going to an estancia would have been going to a very expensive country side restaurant combined with some horseback walking, relaxing to a pool or taking pictures of the area. When I asked one of the estancial close to DeAreco about what i can expect if I come there they sent me the menu! with some vague comments that guest can take part of teh activities of the gauchos. I know that many people are very pleased with estansias and i am sure that there is a reson for that. I doubt it though that you will be getting the horseback riding experience there that you would get otherwisw from Cabalos a la par. Again I have not been in estancia and can not make comparisons. So in short if you are novis or advanced and want to have your adrenaline up riding horses in a wild place and feel like home and among friends go to Cabalos a la par. This is amust do trip in Buenos Ayres for those who wnat something different and really fun. As they say a picture worth a thousand words. I am putting together my travel notes from Buenos Ayres and Patagonia and will publish them shortly. There i will put some pictures from my horseback riding moments so you can see the beauty of the place. if you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me.To get there call Adrian to pick you up if you are a group from BA. You can also take a bus from Retiro.The bus is 129 PLAZA (red buss with the sign PLAZZA) to the city of La Plata (for Camino Centenario). You have to get down in Rotonda de Gutierrez.(Its a big rotary and the buss stops there anyways but tell the driver. Takes 45 minutes to arrive there. Adrian will pick you from there."

            "review": "Best Part of Our Trip to Argentina!. All we can say is wow - great experience, value and service for the money! Adrian, who will likely answer any email inquiries or calls, was a fantastic host who is not only passionate about his country and the horses/park in which you spend your time, but also about the people he takes care of (aka us). He and another colleague started the company a short time ago, planning for several years after he gave up his city job and decided to hunker down in the park where he's been riding for more than 30 years and open it up to tourists like us.For $75 pp, we got a truly personalized, private experience that we will never forget. It's such a step away from the city, yet not very far at all. We were both inexperienced riders, but Adrian was a fantastic instructor (with his colleague Sergio taking great care of the horses) - always encouraging and patient (you can tell he has kids). After arriving and sitting down for a pre-ride conversation that included some delicious pastries and a little lesson in mate (their traditional tea-like drink), we set out for several hours in the park - which went by quickly. We got some basics on how to just ride and steer, and within about 40 minutes, he was instructing us on how to gallop! Because the day was just for us, we developed our skills in light speed. The park was a mix of sun and shade, forest and open field, so there was a lot to take it.Again, just want to reiterate how passionate Adrian was and how he truly takes care of his customers. We took pictures while we were out there an emailed them a few days later even...a lot of nice touches. We wish him the best.The main tip is to not book something right after the tour, in theory, will end, so you can truly relax while you're out there. While the park is about 30 minutes outside the city, we dealt with monday morning rush hour, so it took us about 40 minutes just to get out of BA and another 30 to get to the park. If we needed to get back to BA for another scheduled activity, we would have missed out on part of what was an amazing time! All in all, we were picked up at about 10 and returned at about 4 - partly because we enjoyed hanging out and speaking with Adrian and Sergio before and after riding, we likely rode for more than two hours and a little because of the traffic.The second tip is to wear bug spray. It rained the day before we came, so mosquitos were prevalent. Adrian had some in his car, but we forgot to ask for some until it was too late!And, finally, prepare to get a bit sweaty in the sun and dirty from dust kicking up from some of the paths - but that's part of the fun!"

This ranch will provide many options for spending a magical time in the national forest in the most exciting way...you will be able to ride horses for 2-3 hour sessions or longer if you like...going through a beautiful forest and in the middle of nature....What I most liked about my experience was that you're flexible in your time and the instructors are happy to plan the day or session as you wish. Also, they will provide you with the best trained horses, having had some experience with riding in the US, I believe it's the best way to be introduced to riding or enhance your riding skills.....even if you have no experience riding, you will be easily galloping by the end of the session if you want!If you do end up going, I suggest planning a half day session where you can eat at the restaurant in the park in the middle of your riding session, they have the most basic and delicious meat/food and the most fresh salad you can imagine...I highly recommend riding in the forest...and I am certainly going back...!Best,BB"

I've ridden horses in the past and I enjoyed myself but I never felt as comfortable as I did on this trip.Adrian is not only an excellent teacher who is kind and gives encouragement but he holds safety very high. He provided helmets; that we all wore, the equipment was in excellent condition and it was adjusted when needed and he always looked out for our well being (i.e. if a loose dog came towards us he would put himself between the dog and the group). Even though we were just on a group ride he would correct how we were sitting, holding the reins and how our feet were in the stirrups. In the end, these small adjustments made riding more comfortable.My first time riding with him he encouraged me to gallop. I tried but quickly decided I didn't want to and that I couldn't. He was patient with me and continued to demonstrate what I needed to do. I tried several times and was ready to give up when the horse started to gallop. To my amazement, I was doing it and I felt at ease, with such focus and i felt so in control. I'll never forget that moment.The property that you ride through is beautiful. There is a combination of thick forest and open fields (that you can gallop in. once you gallop you can't do it enough).Afterward coffee, mate and pastries were provided.Out of all the times I rode a horse I never felt this in control, safe and blissful.TIP:From Palermo you can take the 68 bus that goes down Pueyrredon to Rivadivia. At this intersection there is a Plaza (green area). This is where you can catch the 129 PLAZA bus (red bus with PLAZA written on the side). We had to buy the bus ticket before getting on the bus. It was 4 pesos. There are 2 buses that are called 129 PLAZA. Make sure you get on the one that says \"Camino Centenario\" (not autopista). Ask the driver to tell you when your at your stop \"Rotunda Gutierrez\". This is where Adrian picked us up."

We cantered through fields of wild flowers and grass and rode through amazing jungles. This was not a nose-to-tail ride. It was a truly unique and unforgettable experience. The horses are well trained and responisive. I rode 3 different horses (1 of them very briefly as he didn't fit well). The specially designed saddles and hat were extremely comfortable. I rode all day without soreness or chafing. Never before have I had the chance to canter more on a horse. It was exhilarating! One of the other unique things is the personal attention and training. Adrian rode along side and offered instruction to improve my riding skills. He is a gifted teacher and I learned much. This is an absolute MUST DO for anyone horse lover visiting Buenos Aires."

Neither of us had been to Buenos Aires before and we knew that we wanted at least one city tour (to get us better acquainted for our guide-less travel) as well as one non-city tour. We choose Tomas because of the Tripadvisor reviews and could not be happier with our choice (thanks Tripadvisor reviewers). We started with the City Walking Tour on our first full day in Buenos Aires. Tomas picked us up from our hotel and took us on quite the adventure. We began the tour with coffee and a brief history lesson, which Tomas tailored to our questions and interests. We then walked to Recoleta Cemetary where we received a personal and detailed description of the many monuments. We then made our way to La Boca, where we had lunch and walked around the markets, taking in the sites. We ended with a drive back to our hotel taking the longer route, where Tomas showed us various parts of the city that he'd recommend we visit. His recommendations were perfect. We ended up visiting many of those spots, including Palermo Soho, the following day. We had such an amazing time with Tomas that we decided to do another tour the following week. We ended up choosing the Delta Tour and had a blast on the boat. Tomas drove us to the boat where we ended up on a private, 2 hour ride along the Delta. He stopped at several points to let us take pictures and point out various sites of interests. Tomas then took us to a local spot, where we had coffee and watched families picnicking in the park. We ended the tour with the ideal picture spot--Tomas took us to an area where the city of Buenos Aires was the background to our last picture. Tomas clearly enjoys being a tour guide. His tours are personal, layered with family anecdotes and personal experiences. He's never rushed nor does he try to force you to a \"set\" agenda. He has an outline of the tour, but often asked us questions in an effort to tailor the sites to our preferences. We had an incredible time on both trips!"

Based on prior reviews, Tomas appeared to cater for a custom experience and I was not disappointed. Tomas incorporated my desire to visit La Boca, enjoy some excellent food and Malbec and tour the La Recoleta cemetery. What an awesome day focused entirely on me! Two days later Tomas invited me to travel to Lobos and Uribelarrea to experience the ranch lands and smaller towns. Amazing. By the end of our second tour I not only had an inspiring experience but a new friend. Thank you Tomas."

            "review": "5 star review for a 5 star guide. My wife and I did 3 tours with Bonaventura - 2 full day trips (city tour and ranch) and a half day to ESMA museum.There are many people organising tours of BA but I cannot believe any are better than Tomas. The city tour was very well planned, covered all the major sites in just about the right amount of detail and allowed enough flexibility to spend more time in places of particular interest (in my case Boca Juniors stadium). The ranch trip was also wonderful, and rounded off our 5 days in BA perfectly.However, what sets Bonaventura apart from the others is Tomas and the fantastic care he shows his customers. It was just like being shown around by a friend - he's a really funny guy, and a pleasure to spend time with. He also knows his stuff and, if he is not sure of anything, takes the time to find out (for example, ESMA is somewhere not many tourists go and he spent time with his colleague Juan doing research to ensure my visit went perfectly. How many other people would do that?)He also taught us a few phrases in Spanish which will be very useful for our future trips in South America.Save yourself a lot of time and effort and entrust Tomas with all your tours around BA.A great guide, an even nicer person."

The tango tour had a special event for the date we were available and he refunded the money immediately. He found another tango show made reservations but found out that the place would take even less money if we paid directly to the show. The tour: He picked us up promptly , drove us around , showed us the many areas and was very flexible about places and time. He is quite passionate about the history of Argentina and had lots to say about it. . What was very interesting to me was we spoke a lot about the present political situation and the currency fluctuations with the Christina Kirchner vs the Marci governments/inflation and how Argentineans have to deal with it. The weather was very cold and time was running out so he told us he would show us the Recoleta Cemetery the next day . If you want a flexible private tour I would recommend this."

As well as the usual landmarks he is willing to adapt the tour to suit individual interests and, when it comes to food, he certainly knows the good, more local feeling restaurants to visit. He even let the tour overrun so that we could drive out of town to go to a surfer's bar, where he treated us to a merienda to finish off the day. Many thanks Tomas"

He's a fun witty guy who keeps your attention. He brought us to some of the cities finest restaurants that I otherwise would have never found. My biggest complain about some tour guides is that they are boring. Tomas is not. I highly recommend Thomas to anyone that wants to have a good time and see the beautiful city."

The boat tour was a great adventure, and we got many fantastic pictures of the city skyline and the river. If you're interested in South American history, he can provide very detailed and entertaining accounts of Argentina's colonial history, independence, and modern history -- I love that kind of thing and we talked about it for at least an hour throughout the tour (he even illustrates it with hilarious maps and pictures).We did a nice boat ride, an excellent lunch at a local restaurant on the Tigre river (accessible only by boat), went out for drinks, and then did a driving tour of Buenos Aires. My wife wanted some specific shoes (alpargatas) and clothes, and he knew exactly where to go to for her to get what she wanted (and at a really good price too).He speaks perfect English, is quite funny, and has a private car to take you everywhere. My only regret is not doing the tour earlier in our trip (we did it on the last day), as he pointed out lots of places we wished we could go back and visit and eat at."

Born and raised in Buenos Aires, he does a great job of giving both textbook and personalized history of the area. He is also hilarious and full of energy! We loved the boat tour, grabbing drinks and dessert at one of his favorite (and secluded) spots, and driving around the city. I was bummed that I didn't purchase some shoes at the market the day before and he brought us to the best place in the city to purchase them! I can't recommend him enough- it was the highlight of our week. We only wished we had scheduled our tour for one of our first days in city since he did such a great job of listing out areas we should see and restaurants where we should dine!"

We drove the 90 minute trip to San Antonio de Areco to visit the world famous silversmith (who gave us a private demonstration of his creative process). From there we went to the El Ombu ranch and had a very relaxing day of riding horses, eating a traditional Asado and relaxing by the pool. Tomas knew the hosts at the ranch and they took very good care of us. Tomas gave us a great history of Argentina, the Pompas region and Argentinean politics. He is very transparent and a lot of fun. We have 2 teenagers, and the loved his style and the information that he shared with us. By the end of the day, we have become good friends. We highly recommend Tomas for a Buenos Aires City tour, the Delta tour, or the Estancia tour."

We wanted to avoid the more touristic itineraries so I developed my own combining a visit to the Tigre Delta with a casual horse ride at the estancia Los Dos Hermanos in an adjoining province. Tomas was the only guide willing to work outside the square and we were so glad he was! Our party of four had a most memorable day thanks to all Tomas' efforts. He was an absolute joy - humorous, insightful and passionate about his local Delta area. We enjoyed a fabulous picnic lunch aboard his speedboat, complete with champagne, before heading off for the estancia. Tomas produced another lovely surprise for Sally who wasn't up for riding. We cannot speak highly enough about the quality of Tomas' services - he is fabulous. Tomas also recommended and booked a great Parrilla and Salon Canning Milonga for us - both were fantastic with a real 'local' flavour. Thank you Tomas!"

On our first day, we had a long layover in Buenos Aires, and when our plane was delayed Thomas was wonderful about helping us adjust our itinerary to things that we were interested in. Our next tour was the full day City Tour, and it was really a full day! Thomas knows his history and loves his city. This day we were with another couple and we all had a fabulous time. On the third day, Thomas took us to the Tigre and after a perfectly charming boat ride he dropped us at the airport. Thomas provides personal attention for small groups. Be aware that he is a fount of information and talks very very quickly, but if you only get half of what he says it will be twice as much as other tours. And you'll have a lot more fun. Highly recommend Thomas with Bonaventura!"

Hotel receptionist put us in contact with Tomas and he put together a fishing trip for us within that short time for a very reasonable price. He picked us up from the hotel about 8.30am and drove to the boat. All fishing gear with live bait were ready to go. Guy in the boat was also very friendly. We had a great time on the river fishing and enjoying the calm waters. He brought sandwiches and setup a nice picnic lunch on the boat. I enjoyed couple of beers and sandwiches he had prepared while my son did all the fishing. He caught 2 small catfish. Tomas, I still have the Cigar you gave me. I should smoke it one of these days, On the way back to hotel, he went out of the way to show us some nice neighborhoods. He didn't have to do this as it was not part of the trip. He genuinely enjoy the work he does, very knowledgeable and takes time to make his guests happy. Thank you very much for the great fishing trip and the company you provided for both of us.

Thomas has a good grasp of the English language, so conservation with him were great! The next day started at 9 am and covered the cemetery, the city proper and then on to La Roca for lunch. More sites and tea and a history lesson finished the day. Highly recommended. Thomas supplied a clean automobile, fuel, tolls and parking for a reasonable price of about $25/hr. He does his best to not offend anyone, least of all his customers.Stayed at the Bel Air Hotel at a very reasonable $65/night with a great breakfast and attentive English speaking reception staff."

After reading all previous positive comments, it was a no brainer that we wanted to try this tour. So 2 days after our arrival in BA we sent a email to Tomas. We had a prompt and complete reply including all relative infos. So we booked the tour by email, the day after, Tomas arrived at our hotel on time, punctual, for picking us as agreed. On top of that he was smily, friendly and he explained in details our day tour agenda. We felt safe and in good hand with him, trust was established from there. So we ride in their vehicle from San Telmo where we stayed to the Delta. From this point a true Buenos Aires history lessons started and that for the entire day. Tomas has so much culture he knows EVERYTHING about Argentina and South America! But the best is coming!After about 45 MINUTES we arrived at Tomas boat. A very comfortable, recent and well maintained bowrider 180. Their boat is perfect to discover the Delta because it allows us to go in all branch of the Delta even if water level is very low in some spot.In the Delta you feel like if your are in another world. We were so relaxed. no rush, no pressure and Tomas priority was our satisfaction. For lunch time Tomas stopped the boat in a bay with a stuning view of Buenos Aires. The contrast is amazing!Tomas boat is a floating Argentina encyclopedia!If you want boating, relaxing and learning about Argentina history and Delta area for sure, dont look elsewhere its the place to go!

He is an encyclopedia of knowledge and knows much history of Buenos Aires and Argentina in general. He catered to what we were interested in seeing and learning. In addition to being a great tour guide, Tomas has a network of contacts in which he connected us with show tickets for a Tango show with a good discount; which included private driver pickup, dinner with unlimited wine, and classic Tango show. If you are in Buenos Aires, I highly recommend you connect with Tomas as he is the owner of his company and operates small to keep things personal. Tomas will take care of you and show you Buenos Aires from a locals perspective."

Tomas is a relaxed funny guy that really wants to show as much as posible of his city, at the same time he knows a lot of history that makes the tour so much more intresting. He has a good idea where to take you but he also does a lot of spontainius stops where not to much tourists goes. We went with Tomas for 2 days and he was also very good with the baby. Even if we saw and learned a lot, for sure we will book a new trip with him when we go back to Buenos Aires!"

He tailors the tour to your interests. After a brief stop over coffee and ice cream, he determines (very accurately) your interests and desired pace. Since we were spending two days with him, some of the stops from the city tour were deferred until the second day to give us time to explore further. If you want to do something beyond his standard two tours, let him know in advance and he will be prepared to do what you want to do - not what he wants to do. He does not expect you to pay his way at lunch; rather he will split the tab with you. I would most highly recommend traveling with him with Tomas and look forward to seeing him again."

He obviously has an extensive network at the vast majority of tourist attractions because he was able to make calls on the spot and get us or help us change reservations or extend closing times to ensure we could make an attraction, He provided good and solid guidance on a wide range of topics like exchanging money, on which restaurants to visit, on the food to try, and how to tour sites on your own. In summary, he is gem and is still growing as a tour guide thinking how to make future tours more interesting, more factual, and more cohesive. You won't go wrong hiring Bonaventura."

Our group LOVED it. We would highly recommend it to anyone out that way with a day to spare and it was such great value!"

Tomas served as our key to quickly learning the cities districts & rich/complex history. It was quickly apparent that he was both a polished conversationalist and well-versed historian. His excellent recounting of BA's/Argentina's rich diverse..and often tragic history added immeasurably to our enjoyment and appreciation of what we were doing and seeing. His intuitive sensing of what we wanted to see/do was especially appreciated. While the tour was initially structured to do/see a certain itinerary, he was fully adaptable to modest revisions and tailored the outing to our interests..this is the hallmark of real gem tour guide. A somewhat 'shot in the dark' (as all tour selections are) turned out to be a bulleye and made our BA sojourn a marvelous excursion. Thanks again, mi amigo."

I would suggest to stop into San Isidro, as it\u2019s a gorgeous town on the way to Tigre. The boat portion through the delta area was ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!! He gave us some history as we went through areas of it and it amazes me how beautiful it was. We then stopped at the opening of the Tigre, where he dropped the anchor and we had sandwiches and a Quilmes (we drank the beer and he had water and Pepsi :-) When we were done we went to lunch at a spot in Tigre with a nice view of the water. From there, we went on to Peru Beach, which was a very nice spot with locals only. We had desert and coffee and he gave us a very detailed history lesson on Argentina and Buenos Aires. From there, we went to an amazing photo location for a nice photo of BA from a distance. On the way back to the hotel, he continued to talk about himself and Argentina. That night, my wife and I were very happy, and we credit that to Tom\u00e1s!!!

Tomas' toured just the two of us around Buenos Aires based on our interests and answered all of our questions. He also adjusted the tour on a dime based on our input.Second, Tomas was very prompt when he picked us up. Yet, he extended the tour based on our interests. Basically, his timing is impeccable. He takes traffic and weather into consideration when making decisions, as well as the need to stop for food. He is definitely flexible and adaptable.Third, Tomas is both intelligent and uniquely aware of local, national and world politics. He provides context for historical and architectural tours if you are interested in learning about such things. Both of us were very interested. Tomas even took time to draw us a diagram examining the unique political history of Buenos Aires. All of this was entertaining and fun at the same time.Fourth, Tomas will ensure that you are safe on your tour.

He will answer any question openly and honestly while also sharing his personal perspective. He knows the ins and outs of everything about the city. Ask away, your questions will be answered.Sixth, Tomas is an excellent photographer. He will ensure that you look great in all of the photos that he helps you take.Seventh, Tomas knows food if you are into eating, he knows where to go. While you are there, he can describe the unique characteristics of the people living in the neighborhood that you are visiting.Eighth, Tomas is a generous tour guide. He got candy for us:)Ninth, Tomas was born and bread in Buenos Aires. He even attended law school at a university in the city.Tenth and last, you will have a great time!"

Over croissant and cafe, Tomas gave a Cliff's Note version of Argentinian history which informed every sight we visited from then on. The 2nd day, we toured Peru Beach (spectacular views of the BA skyline) and La Boca where we had lunch in a quaint little Italian restaurant, and I bought some artwork. The boat tour of the Delta and Tigre area was the third day, and that was amazing. What an insight into the area where so many Portenos relax and leave the city behind. Charming homes all along the calm and relaxing riverways, and a picnic lunch with another incredible view of the BA skyline. I recommend Tomas' Bonaventura Trips to everyone! I can't imagine a trip to Buenos Aires without time spent with Tomas."

            "review": "Do you like food? Book with Tomas in Bonaventura Trips!. We had spent two days with Tomas in his lovely city of Buenos Aires! We started with a trip on the Tigre River! I wasn't sure what to expect but parts of it were like a little cruise thru the Amazon. I am glad we did this as it was a true of the beaten path attraction that shouldn't be missed. Tomas has a small motor boat that allows exploration of the little streams that branch off the Tigre river, one gets a good view of how people live in this area. We had a few coffee stops through the day and had a little picnic on the boat. Tomas quickly figured out I have a sweet tooth and was anxious to let me try all sorts of candy, pastries the country has to offer. We had a delicious steak lunch at a local restaurant that had a lovely garden as well.Day two we started at a lovely landmark Cafe Tortola with some coffee and pastries. Tomas certainly knows his history but unlike other guides, if you are uninterested in what he has to say, he will quickly change the subject. It is a tour truly centered on your interests. He took us thru many neighborhoods including La Boca, San Telmo and Recoletta. The fun part was stopping for a taste of local empanadas and grilled cheese (provoletta)! Later in our trip we had some of these things in other places but they weren't as good as the places Tomas took us thru. Next time we come to Buenos Aires we will definitely count on a Food tour with Tomas! He is great company and a palate for tasty Argentinian treats!"

If you are looking for a tour where the guide points out every building as you drive through the tourist area, book a tour with someone else. If you want a relaxed tour fine tuned for your interests, book with Bonaventura Trips and Tomas.Tomas is not formal. From the moment you meet him, you feel like you are with a friend. We spent 2 days with him exploring the Delta region and downtown area. Each day began over coffee where we discussed the plan for the day. On the first day, we explored Tigre and the Delta region. Tigre is a beautiful little town that feels like the Spanish coast. After some caf\u00e9 con leche and treats, we went on his private boat through the rivers and streams of the delta. If you want to relax or if you want to experience the non-touristy areas, this is the perfect tour. Do not do it if seeing every tourist site is on your agenda. We spent several hours driving through the waterways or anchored in the Rio San Antonio overlooking downtown Buenos Aires while drinking beer and eating snacks. Highly recommended day if you want to get off the beaten path.The second day again began with coffee in the Caf\u00e9 Tortoni, a regal coffee house from the golden era of Argentina. While now clearly serving more tourists than locals, a visit is worthwhile in order to appreciate what life was like here in the early 20th century. After visiting all of the typical tourist spots (the Pink House, the Cathedral, etc), Tomas took us to La Boca. The tour typically visits La Bombonera, the stadium of La Boca Junior football team. The stadium and museum are critical for any visit to Buenos Aires if one is a sports fan, and I enjoyed the visit. My wife, however, was bored at the stadium, and you should let Tomas know if you are not a sports or football fan. After the stadium, we stopped for lunch in a local caf\u00e9. From the appearance, I was convinced that I would be ill the rest of the trip, but the food was fantastic. I highly recommend the empanadas and grilled cheese. They were the best that we had during our trip to Argentina. La Boca is fantastic, and use the time there to shop if you do not like sports. We then went to La Recoletta ceremony where the passion of Tomas for Argentinian history was apparent.Tomas is a great guide. My family and I have traveled throughout the world, and we have not experienced a guide with so much enthusiasm before. He loves Argentina, and he wants you to love his country."

We started our day with a little caf\u00e9 and then headed to the neighborhood of Boca. We walked and talked about the area, history, landmarks, and visited Boca Juniors Stadium. He and I bought some Argentinian Futbol gear for the World Cup Final game the next day. Aside from the great tour, he gave great restaurant recommendations (also a great recommendation of where to watch the World Cup Final). After Boca, we went to other great parts of the City, including Recoleta Cemetery, which is amazing!! What makes this tour really great is that it's just like having a friend take you around the city. He gives a great history lesson throughout the tour, which all comes together in the Cemetery when you get to see the tombs of all the different people he mentioned. After enjoying our city tour so much, we were going to do the Delta tour a couple days later, but we just didn't have the time. Thanks again Tomas, we'll be calling you for our next trip!!

All this makes a unique and special experience out of a regular day at the delta. We spent all morning exploring the delta talking about life, music and, of course, the story behind what we were seeing at such a huge natural area. We even got to see Buenos Aires from the river! Later on we got to a really nice quiet part of the delta where he surprised us with some snacks and drinks. We had our own little picnic on the boat! After a while eating and talking we decided to go back. Tom\u00e1s showed us the Navy Museum which, by the way, is awesome, and around the river-side streets that are simply beautiful.All in all, one of the best tours I've ever taken!"

Being quite possibly the only time in our lives when we might be in Argentina, we booked Tomas for 3 days of private touring. We based using Tomas primarily on the great comments on Tripadvisor and his pre-trip correspondence offering options, taking the time to understand what we were wanting out of a tour and his assistance in planning out the days before our arrival. After meeting Tomas we spent a day touring the city, a day in the \"province\" of San Antonio del Arco and finally a day on the Tigre Delta. We had a great time every day and would not have changed anything. As many people have said, it was like having a knowledge friend showing you the sights. I won't repeat all of the details well covered in the numerous other reviews. It was a great combination of tourist must see sights and local not so tourist sights. He also took the time to offer recommendations and directions for wandering Buenos Aires on our own during our \"off\" days. I would give him 6 stars.We now hope to visit Argentina again and would certainly use Tomas again for some new adventures."

After some investigation, we decided a trip to the Tigre Delta was just the ticket and started searching for a guide to take us there. We pretty quickly ruled out the larger group tours. Being packed on a bus just to be packed onto a boat has about zero appeal to us, so we started looking at guides who did private tours. After reading through the review, Tom\u00e1s seemed to fit the profile. A quick email, and he had confirmed us for a day trip, picking us up and dropping us off at our hotel in Palermo Soho. We could not have been happier with our choice. Tom\u00e1s feels more like a friend of a friend rather than a tour guide. He is very laid back, friendly and has a great sense of humor. His English is excellent and his insights into local culture are excellent. He doesn't sound like someone who has given the same tour 100 times. Rather, the experience with him feels like he is taking his friends in his boat to show off the area.He took us through some of the smaller areas of the Delta, not just focusing on the big sites and the rowing clubs. We had a chance to see the grocery boats out delivering to the locals. For lunch, he took us to Villa Julia for an excellent, and very reasonably-priced lunch. We sat out in the lawn under a canopy and enjoyed chatting about the history of the country, something Tom\u00e1s has a passion for.After the Tigre, we went to Peru Beach to sit out and watch the sunset while having a beer. Overall a fantastic day with a wonderful guide. I would highly recommend Tom\u00e1s to anyone looking for a fun day around BA. Well worth the very modest fee."

He was personable..and really just fun to be around! What sets this tour different than the rest is a number of things. First, the tour is individualized to what your needs are and what you want to see. Secondly, you get personal attention and every question answered. I didn't feel like I was just another tourist but hanging out with a local, someone who answered all our questions and who really let us in on the cultural aspects of being an Argentinean.We did two tour day with Tomas. The first day we explored BA. We went to the \"Pink House\" where crazily we got to get in to the President's office and actually see the desk she worked at! We also got to explore the famous cemetery of Recoleta. Tomas was great telling us the important history and stories of each site...he is so knowledgeable! He knew every answer to our questions...and really focuses on the history and culture of the events. At the end of the tour, Tomas was so sweet he actually stayed around our hotel while we got ready and dropped us off at a dinner spot he recommended (which we thought was likely the best steak we've ever had). We were so grateful Tomas took time out of his day to do this.Our second tour was of the Delta...which was a special way to see the outskirts of BA. Tomas took us around in his boat, and we got to have a very enjoyable lunch in one of the restaurants on the delta. Such pretty sights...He actually even showed us his own home on the delta..it was wonderful to interact with his family and truly feel like a local.Basically Tomas went above and beyond for us and really made our stay in BA. We recommend him whole heartedly...if your looking for a personable, fun, local friend with incredible knowledge of history and culture then Tomas is the guide for you! Thanks Tomas!"

The first day we toured the Tigre River Delta on his boat and lunched at a rowing club. The tour provided us with first-hand knowledge of how the people on the river live using only boat transportation as there are no roads. We passed supermarket boats and were told that boats were used as school buses for local children. From the boat we had a view of Buenos Aires as we looked southward. We ate lunch at a rowing club in Tigre before returning to the city and I had divine cannelloni. It was a lovely boat, and Tomas is an excellent driver. I highly recommend this tour if you would like to see the countryside outside the city. The next three days Tomas took us to see all of the sights of the city as well as entertaining my husband at a cafe while I did some shopping. His English is excellent, and he is very knowledgeable about the city and about Argentina history. His tour of Recolleta Cemetery is especially enlightening.  Tomas showed us Carminito Street and guided us to a cafe known to locals. He also took us to Don Julio Restaurant for a real Argentina steak (the best meal we had in Argentina).  I had done a great deal of research before our trip, and I shared my list of things we wanted to see and do with Tomas. He was very enthusiastic about showing us all the sights that we requested, and he made each day both educational and fun.  He took us to the Belle Artes Museum and knew much about the art there. I requested a visit to a Milonga, and he was eager to show it to us. We had attended a River Plate \"futbol\" game, but we wanted to see Bombanera Stadium and Museum where Boca Juniors play. He knew all about the exhibits in the museum, and he really made the experience a powerful one. We have had many guides on other trips, but Tomas became more than just a guide for us. He became more like a son or friend. We will definitely stay in touch with him. He gets my highest recommendation. Also, Tomas's fee is very reasonable compared to the guides we have had other places. If you can afford to book him for your entire stay in Buenos Aires, do so. You won't be disappointed , and you will have a great experience."

Tomas made the city come alive and each of us experienced both a sense of history as well as being personally a part of the city. Tomas has the knowledge; more importantly, the ability to convey it. Guides are always difficult, they represent the unknown. It is rare when one proves himself (or herself) superlative...Tomas did just that. We recomend Tomas to anyone visiting Buenos Aires."

The tour included a visit to LA BOCA, the famous football stadium and home of Boca Juniors.We also visited the new port district of Puerto Madero built on the site of the old Port. Next was San Telmo district .This is twinned with the hidden ancient and colonial ares of Buenos Aries. Plaza De Mayo founded in 1580 was next. This is an important landmark. (Evita used to speak to the people from here ). Our tour also included a visit to LA RECOLETA , the little Paris of South America and one of the most important districts. Here we visited the unique and famous cemetery.This is where Evita is buried As you can see this was a very thorough tour.Tomas ensured we achieved our objectives and his friendly pleasing attitude made it a very enjoyable. This was a memorable and fun tour experience. I would highly recommend Thomas"

However he was only ten minutes late having, unbeknown to us, sent an email with apologies. We were soon on our way in his car and as the weather looked a bit doubtful he asked if we would prefer to go for the river tour on a larger, covered boat. Fortunately we decide against this and went to a boatyard to pick up his father's motor boat. The weather changed for the better and we thoroughly enjoyed going along some of the narrow creeks which would not have been possible in a larger boat. The scenery was amazing with lovely views of the houses and gardens along the river banks. After an hour or so we anchored in the middle of the channel and enjoyed a welcome glass of beer before returning to Tigre for lunch. this we had in a very nice restaurant beside the river and afterwards had a tour of the Naval Museum which was nearby. Here Tomas was able to show his extensive knowledge of the items on display and all to soon it was time to return to the city. The whole experience lasted for over seven hoursd and we consider it excellent value for money."

He is a funny guy, who achieved a great balance between informative tour guide and fun-to-know local. The boat ride around Tigre is relaxing and beautiful. It really feels like a world away from the hustle and bustle of Buenos Aires. A visit to the navy museum proved to be very interesting, thanks to Tom\u00e1s. We got a peek into Argentinean history and a few anecdotal stories along the way.The day concluded with a great lunch. Overall, I highly endorse this company!"

His prices are reasonable in comparison to the other tour guides. Surprisingly we found BA to be very expensive. If you are on a budget or have a large family (private tour prices in BA are based on the number of people not per family like in Europe) do not hesitate to contact Thomas. Our favourite tour was of Recoleta cemetery where Thomas has shown a vast knowledge of the BA history. The delta of Tigre was nice and relaxing. The Gaucho experience was OK. There was not much to do but if you are looking for a relaxing day on the farm with really good food you will definitely enjoy this get away. Host family at the estancia is very nice and hospitable. They went above and beyond to make us feel at home."

We have a group of 6 people and had not planned anything except for We are Tango which we very much look forward to. So I tried my lucky to contact Tomas by email after seeing such raving reviews from other reviewers. Tomas replied my email first thing the next morning with a suggestion of what he proposes to do with us. I saw the email just when we landed in BA. I jumped to the opportunity and we agreed to meet at our apartment 2 hours after we checked in. Since we have granny of 85 yo traveling with us walking tour is out of the question. Tomas arranged a minvan and there we go. He is such a jolly and enthusiastic guide. We had a great trip seeing a number of famous tourist spots in the city (football club, a local tourist spot where most houses are built on old ship wrecks, then St Martin's Church where Pope Francis used to be celebrating mass, the pink government house, and of course the Rocoleta Cemetery where Evita Peron was buried). It was supposed to be a rest day for Tomas but he agreed to spend the afternoon with us and made an excellent first impression of this important world city to us. Tomas is an excellent amateur singer and he sang us a song before we end our fun, entertaining and memorable city tour. We can't thank him enough."

In this very large city we were able to see all the key neighborhoods. Tomas is friendly, knowledgable, and speaks very good English. Also, he is very flexible; if you express special interest in a particular site (the Football Stadium, for instance) he will take you there. Sinc\u00e9 he has been a student of history he had much to tell about the origins and development of modern day Argentina. Especially impressive was our visit to the Recolete Cemeterio where his recitation of history interwoven with the visible evidence--literally shrines-- of many of the former leaders of the country, combined to make a fascinating visit. On a second full day tour we asked Tomas to drive us to Tigre and again we weren\u00b4t disappointed. He knew the town (and canals) intimately as his family has a \"country\" home there.It is a \"must see\" destination: beautiful and unique. All in all we can recommend Bonaventura Private Tours without reservation. In the person of Tomas we know you\u00b4re going to enjoy the attributes of a knowledgeable and personable private guide as you experience the wonders of Buenos Aires and Tigre."

On 26 February I and five fellow travelers enjoyed an excellent seven-hour (full-day) tour of Buenos Aires with Grisel of Cultural Cercana Tours. We had made all arrangements through Mara, of the same company, and found details exactly as we\u2019d been promised. Well, there was one hitch -- which was not the company\u2019s fault \u2013 and I\u2019ll explain that in a moment.Our guide Grisel and her driver picked us up, as arranged, at our hotel at 9:00 am. The company van was spotless and comfortable. By the end of the day we had visited the Plaza de Mayo, the Atenio Bookstore, La Boca, San Telmo, Palermo, Puerto Madero, and Recoleta. As outside guides are not permitted to take groups into the Teatro Colon, Grisel had planned to take us to the opera house, help us to purchase house tour tickets, and wait for us to finish that separate tour. High demand from multiple cruises in town upset that plan, and we saw Recoleta instead. (Fortunately, we were able to get to the Colon the next morning before embarking on our cruise ship.) It was clear from Grisel\u2019s true disappointment at the theater that she had not expected this problem.The tour was one of the best my partner and I have had in a dozen years of travel on five continents. This is a company that provides great value, and we recommend it highly. The day started off with a hard rain while we were visiting the Plaza de Mayo. Grisel did not miss a beat handing her umbrella to one of us and standing in the rain herself. Nor did she cut any corners in her descriptions. Later, when the weather cleared, she led us to a popular Avenida de Mayo caf\u00e9 for coffee and pastries. And the lunch she arranged for us later in La Boca was a true sampling of local fare. Her English was excellent and her intuition about the questions we hadn\u2019t thought to ask just as good. Johnny, the driver, was also fluent in English, delightful in person, and very competent at the wheel. Take the chance to get to know these fine people!"

Our two-day tour of Buenos Aires with our exceptional tour guide Laura was the highlight of our South American cruise. Buenos Aires was our last stop on a 14 day cruise from Chili. Along the way, we had had several very good- to- excellent tour guides at other interesting ports, but our time with Laura was overall the best. Laura's knowledge of and passion for her city were evident throughout the tour. Her English was also excellent. Within the relatively short time we had with her, I was able to appreciate the rich cultural heritage and complex history of this beautiful city. In addition to the \"must see\" tourist spots, she showed us and told us about the various neighborhoods of Buenos Aires. We also saw spots that few tourists see, like the memorial park to the disappeared, which is a moving tribute to a very tragic period. In the more popular tourist spots, such as Ricoleta Cemetery, Laura provided many interesting stories about the people buried there and their connection to the city's history. In addition, she went out of her way to make sure we were taken care of, such as making lunch arrangements at local restaurants and making sure we got into the historic tango salon we requested. Based on this memorable and enriching experience, I highly recommend Cultura Cercana tours and Laura as your guide."

Unfortunately, the original guide assigned to us, Andres had another booking the next day so Mara arranged for both Andres AND Mirta to be present the first day and for Mirta to take us around the following day, so there will be no new faces.I later found out apparently that Andres is the only guide in BA with a Boat Tour License, which made him rather popular! We needed Andres as we wanted to see Tigre and take a private boat tour to look around at our leisure. At first I was a little apprehensive about this with mother in tow, but my worries soon melted away in the warm summer breeze and especially after a pleasant lunch in one of the riverside restaurants. Andres and Mirta were kind and careful in ensuring my mother's comfort and safety. Tigre visit was well worth the drive and boat ride.The next day, Mirta took us around and she made sure my mother was comfortable and was attentive to our needs. Andres even called during our 2nd day tour to make sure we were all happy and comfortable. Now that's service!"

She customized the tour so we saw exactly what we wanted to see and spent the most time at the attractions we were interested in. She took us to a great place for lunch and another stop for gelato! She was very punctual. The van for our tour was very spacious and comfortable, and the driver dropped us off directly at each location. Great tour!"

When researching historical tours of the city I came upon Cultura Cercana customizable walking tours. We were looking for an informative tour of the main sights with a heavy Evita Peron influence. We were not disappointed. Our guide, Andres, turned out to be a History Professor at a local university. His in depth information was worth way more than the fee we paid. He timed our sites to be opposite of the main tour busses to avoid crowds at all the attractions, to that end we were alone at the Evita Tomb, something that rarely happens. I cannot recommend this company and Andres in particular highly enough. He went over and above to make sure the tour was exactly as we wanted."

We started on the south side, and drove and walked through the history and culture of the city. Alejandra did not shelter us from the worst parts of the city, but gave us a fair and balanced view. It is a beautiful city with a rich history and culture. Beautiful parks. We were particularly interested in architecture and Alejandra had an excellent knowledge of the many architectural styles present through the city. She is a local native of BA, very proud and knowledgeable about her city. As an added treat, we had a delicious lunch of empanadas. Wear your walking shoes, as you cannot experience the city without walking some of the streets and visiting some of the buildings. Thank you Alejandra for a great tour. It beat the cruise sponsored tour by a mile!"

Don\u2019t even think of visiting Buenos Aires without hiring Cultura Cercana\u2019s Miguel Andr\u00e9s and his beautiful tour and tango partner, Mirta who is also the grandmother of 5. We have enjoyed much world travel and this New Year's Eve day tour was definitely in our high five! The top-rated Tigres Delta Tour is a must in Argentina. Andr\u00e9s picked us up, took us to the outlying open-air craft market and then to his comfortable boat where he and his teacher-partner Mirta navigated us through a day of the gorgeous river delta with its breath-taking flora, and charming stilted homes unique to the B.A. suburbs. We then docked at the multi-acre livestock farm of Andr\u00e9s\u2019 family where he and Mirta personally prepared and served a memorable meal of h\u2019ors d\u2019oeurves, roasted tenderloin, incredible desserts and any beverage we favored. Following the euphoria they called lunch, our skilled hosts changed footwear and amazed us with their tango talent giving lessons to our party as well. We are still savoring all the edible and idyllic sensory treats lavished upon us by these two warm and wise tour guides. They have set the bar so high, I can\u2019t imagine the rest of our journey through South America can rise to their level\u2026but the memories they made for us will long endure."

He not only has a lot of experience, he also has tones of knowledge to share. He gave us a historic insight of Argentina and stories of Buenos Aires with a feeling of passion that not everyone has. Mirta too is an incredible dancer and teacher with lots of experience. The two of them made our experience more special. Not wanting to spoil it for everyone, the day itself consists of travelling by car through the north of BA to Tigre and then go through the canals to Andres house, have a nice afternoon with delicious food made by them, a bit of tango and come back by boat. The Tigre Delta is impressive, a completely different lifestyle that is worth to get to know. I couldn't recommend this trip more!Thank you so much Andres and Mirta!Joana, Artur, Maria and Miguel"

We kindly paid the lunch of the tour guide, and he asked for the most expensive beef available on the menu, after saying he usually, on this occasions order the cheaper one. Unfortunately we confirmed the bill even directly with the guide and he confirmed his ordering, knowing he had just ordered the opposite he had said he usually does. That left us with a very bad impression. By the way the beef is really good, and you feel tempted to try all the options available. This was really unnecessary because the tour was going well that far. I guess in a business like this there are small details that are sometimes so important...Hope you find this review helpful"

Fabian always responded immediately to all my questions, like \u2018must\u2019 see in BA, tango options, lunch for the group, etc. When we arrived into BA, Fabian was prompt and escorted us to the two (2) air-conditioned big bus and a minivan. Grisel was the big bus tour guide and Andres was the minivan tour guide. Grisel and Andres were OUTSTANDING English tour guides! Both tour guides were very informative, enjoyable, professional, and want to share their extensive knowledge of history. We were lucky that Fabian was with us during our tour. It turned out that the city strike will start that day at 11 PM (it was announced at the ship) and some of the streets were closed. Fabian rerouted the bus and minivan drivers to take us to the attractions without a glitch! We visited the following neighborhoods/attractions, namely, La Boca, the first port, with its colorful houses, street art, football and tango atmosphere everywhere \u2013 Men danced the tango first! San Telmo, the old part of town, with its cobbled stone streets and antiques shops. Downtown area, with the Plaza de Mayo, the Casa Rosada, the Cabildo and the Metropolitan Cathedral (Pope Francis was the Archbishop), all witness of local and South American history. Recoleta, the traces of a luxurious past, with beautiful palaces and an amazing cemetery (interesting stories about Eva Peron, girl buried alive, etc.). Puerto Madero, the recycled former port docks are now the most modern part of town (our famous restroom stop). Palermo, the reinvented neighborhood, nowadays full of design shops, restaurants and cafes.  For quick lunch, as suggested by Fabian, we ate at the El SanJuanino famous for beef and chicken empanadas in Argentina.  I HIGHLY recommend Cultura Cercana for Buenos Aires, Argentina tour. Fabian, Grisel and Andres are great assets to Cultura Cercana!"

Unfortunately, after waiting outside for our tour guide for 30 minutes we finally learned that he would not be able to guide our tour due to a medical emergency. We fully understand that things happen and hope that he is fully recovered. What bothered us was three things.- An emergency number was provided to us and when we had not heard anything 15 minutes after our tour was supposed to begin, I called the number and it was a recording and all in Spanish. That was of no use to me.-As it turned out we saw his colleague about the time he was supposed to be there. She was holding up a sign for other people. We could not quite read the name of the company. About 25 minutes later she came over again and met her group and when we looked closer we saw she was from the same company and asked if she could contact our tour guide. Well, then she pulled out a second sign that was right before that sign that had my name on it. Now, why she didn't ask us 25 minutes earlier what tour company we were waiting for is beyond me.-When we did hear from our guide, it was via e mail. He apologized and noted he had been in terrible pain and had taken pain killers and as he drove towards the terminal he realized he was in too much pain to do the tour. My reaction was if someone has to take pain killers for severe pain it would not be wise to be giving a tour let alone driving a vehicle.Again, I fully understand that things happen but I think this could have been handled a lot better than it was."

We enjoyed his tour so much, two of us did a second tour with him and his tango partner- another tour guide- which included visiting the north part of the city, taking a tour on his boat through the estuaries (best described as cottage country meets louisiana bayou), his farm on one of the islands, plus an excellent meal and some tango lessons. Sure beats the crappy tourist bus!"

Booking with Fabian via email was straightforward, we agreed a price in US$ to be paid in cash at the end of the tour. Grisel was waiting for us at our hotel at the appointed time, with Carlos and the car ready outside. Grisel spoke wonderful English and proved to be a delightfull and knowledgeable companion, whisking us from place to place and finding the special spots where two or three people are welcome where larger groups are not, such as the balcony overlooking the Boca and the little museum at the fabulous old Cafe Tortonu."

I took the 1/2 day tour and Fabian Ali was my guide, this tour was overpriced (USD cash only payment was accepted) and most of the time was in a car driving around to different locations... tour felt very rushed and was jumping from 1 location to another and felt like you spent more time in the car than actually enjoying or doing site-seeing or doing a real tour of a location...The tour was $150 USD for 1/2 day tour (4 hours) which payment is only in cash USD! with the exchange rate and economy this is way overpriced for the quality of tour... I recommend doing a walking tour of Argentina for free and will get a better experience for free (adding a few dollars for tip)! only for the reason of requiring to be paid in cash only and in USD I lowered my rating from a 3 to 2 out of 5...Overall highly disappointed with this tour... Would not recommend at all to do this tour... do the free walking tour instead or the other 2 tours I have done in Argentina which I have 5 star reviews for... the Parrilla Tour which involves food tour and the Tango tour which includes tango lessons, dinner and tango show!!!"

Based on the reviews for Cultura Cercana on TripAdvisor, we booked two full days tours. Laura and Fabian were incredibly tolerate of my endless questions on what to do during our two days. We settled on a full day city tour followed by a full day in the Tigre Delta. Although Fabian was not able to be our guide, he did come to our hotel upon our arrival to introduce himself and finalize our tours. Our guide was Andres and he was absolutely amazing. He was extremely personable and knowledgeable of both the history of Buenos Aires as well as current events. Our first day was spent hitting all the top sights. It seemed that where ever we went, Andres was known by all the locals. Our second day was spent in the Tigre Delta. After a stroll in the town, we got on his boat for a ride up the river delta to his home. He and his tango partner prepared us a wonderful lunch, followed by a tango demonstration and tango lessons! It was one of the highlights of our trip. I highly recommend Cultura Cercana for your private tours in Buenos Aires!"

We learned so much about the culture as well as history of this city, this country and this area! He was extremely helpful in every way and we can't say enough good things about this tour!Alberto guided us for an entire day in Buenos Aires and was also excellent in every way - so knowledgeable, easy to understand, so very willing to help with our concerns for transportation the following day, and so very personable. Again, we learned so much more about the culture and history of this country, this area, and this city - and how both Buenos Aires and Montevideo and their guides compete with each other in interpretations of events and customs! We just can't say enough good things about this tour either!We highly recommend Cultura Cercana for setting up private tours in every city where they work! Thanks for fantastic memories!"

We came via air from Mendoza, and she picked us up at the AEP airport and drove us several places. She quickly adapted as she learned our passion for history and that we had some knowledge of Argentine and BA politics. So we spent quite a lot of time tracking down historical monuments, bullet holes in buildings even. She gave us great info on The Missing and told us no questions were off limits. Because there is publicity now on the 30,000 +\\- missing now, it was easier to get more information now of course. We stopped at a cute place for empanadas as we asked for some good ones.She was an excellent driver, guide, and very thoughtful of the fact I have mobility issues and needed places to stop and sit!The next day, Griselle was our guide, as Laura had another engagement. She was an entirely different personality, but she was excellent as well. We had a separate driver that day, Carlos, who was one of the kindest men we have ever met. Griselle walked with us in a downpour throughout the Recoletta Cemetery, took us to the Alteo bookstore, and to LaBoca. I did not care much for La Boca, so she took us to see the murals we wanted to see and hustled us off to places we asked to see instead, such as the Evita Museum. She also kindly spent an hour with us navigating the Buquebus office to get ferry tickets for Colonia Del Sacremento where we wanted to go the next day(what a hassle and not a good trip really). Giselle is not as polished as Laura and a little weaker on her history, and her English is not as good, but she is lively and engaging and we loved having the contrast of the two guides. They also communicated ahead of time so we did not have redundancy.Neither pushed us into shops or to buy anything. Hooray!"

Fabiano was the best of the best. He really seemed to continually adjust the itinerary, commentary, stops,etc. based on who we were and what we were interested in. Started the tour in the Palermo section with walk through the Rose Garden. Perfect start after a few days at sea. He took us through each of the neighborhoods (San Telmo, Soho, Recoleta, etc.), giving us an overall sense of the city and the people. And he didn't stick to main streets! I love driving down residential roads which in BA are trees lined and very Paris-like. Also Fabiano did an excellent job of telling and showing us the history of Buenos Aires and its portenos. We stopped at the Recoleta Cemetary. Took us to a great local restaurant for lunch -- wine of course and steak and empanadas. We spent a lot of time walking in La Boca where we got to see some street tango. Also visited Plaza de Mayo and the landmarks there. Even took us to a wine shop so we could buy some to take back on the ship. When you only have one day to see a city like Buenos Aires, it is important that the person doing the showing is exceptional and Fabiano was. He is knowledgeable, warm, charming, and efficient."

We gave ourselves four days and three nights in BA and we were not sure how to break the days down properly. After receiving a recommendation from one of our friends, we reached out to Culture Cercana to see their availability, etc. We heard back from Fabian right away and we discussed the best way to enjoy our trip. We were a little concerned about doing a tour on our first day in BA since we would be arriving 4:30am after an 8 hour flight. We decided that doing a tour on our first day would be hard but we knew that being driven around would lighten the load. After checking in and sleeping for two and a half hours, we met Fabian at 9:15am (our fault in being late) in our hotel lobby where he came to pick us up. Even though we were both exhausted, the next 8 hours flew by very quickly. Fabian drove us all over the city, told countless stories and took us to all of the major sites of BA. He was very flexible in terms of what we wanted to see, what we did not care about, etc. He took us to a nice cafe for a quick breakfast and a great place to grab choripan for lunch. He also gave some quick ideas and tips of places to go for other food or other places to explore during our time there. I think one of the advantages of taking this tour on our first day is that we got a quick overview of BA and we were able to get an idea of what we could do our next three days and two nights without having to worry if we had seen it all. BA is a big city and there is a lot to see, so this made it much easier. Like everyone else said, Fabian is very nice, funny and knows his way around BA. I drive all the time in NYC and I could not do what he does, driving through the city while telling all of the stories and pointing out all of the spots to people. And when we had a question while we were in BA, we emailed him and he responded and gave some good advice."

Laura ended up being our guide and she was FABULOUS - I really can't say enough about her. She picked us up in a spacious vehicle right from our doorstep, it was a rainy day and she had extra umbrellas! Laura was very knowledgeable and friendly. She had a great itinerary planned, but was also flexible when we wanted to grab coffee or when the rain was too heavy to fully explore a few spots. She was game for powering through the weather, but was kind enough to skip things when we didn't want to walk around in it and gave us very helpful tips for when we went back and explored on our own. This tour was a great overview of Buenos Aires and really helped us get a feel for the city. I highly recommend booking through this company and requesting Laura. THANKS!"

While visiting Buenos Aires solo for business in October 2014, I found myself with some free time and looking for an exciting English tour of the area. My search immediately ended after finding Cultura Cercana (they offer various English-guided tours in and around Buenos Aires)! I decided to book a private half-day tour of Delta Tigre. My tour guide was Andr\u00e9s; however, \"tour guide\" is an unfair description of him. Andr\u00e9s was more like a great friend whom I hadn't seen in a long time. He was very friendly, accommodating, and happy to share his knowledge of the area with me. His tour of the Delta was very well organized and I will certainly request to do another tour with him during my next trip to Buenos Aires!"

It rained, sometimes poured, the entire day but Fabian made sure we saw the sites and gave us lots of information about the culture, religion, and politics.

Taking a Cultura Cercana tour is by far the best way to see the major attractions of Buenos Aires with the benefit of having an Expert in Argentinian history and culture by your side. The convenience of being picked up and dropped off at our hotel, while being driven around in Andres' clean and comfortable SUV made the whole experience very enjoyable and educational.

Andres and Mirta were brilliant and very entertaining and knowledgable. They took us to places off the beaten track as well as the obvious ones. We also learnt so much about the politics, economy and culture of Argentina which can only be gained from an informed local. Nothing was too much trouble and when we return to BA it would great to see the Delta on Andres boat! Would thoroughly recommend and also note Mirta is a tango dance teacher and we were very disappointed that we could not join her on one of her lessons despite her very kind invitation due to circumstances beyond our control."

We received very prompt responses, directly from Fabian - who was helpful with a few other scheduling questions we had prior to our visit. Fabian is an excellent tour guide - very thorough, with lots of details on each part of the city we visited. He answered all of our questions, told us interesting tidbits and side notes about things. All in all it was a great tour! We were even interviewed in front of the Boca Jrs stadium by a Brazilian TV station - this was a couple of days after Brazil lost to Germany and one day after Argentina made it into the finals in the World Cup. So, that was something unique to remember!I will note one minor detail - one that was fine with us, but was not necessarily expected based on the tour description we had. We were told lunch would be on our own, and Fabian was kind enough to give us a few recommendations. We decided to go to the parilla he suggested, since we had not yet had a chance to go to one. Upon arrival, Fabian joined us for lunch - something we all thought was great and were happy to have him. Upon finishing the meal, however, we did end up picking up the full check. I only mention it so readers will can aware that this a possibility and be prepared.We highly recommend this tour company for a personal, informative experience. Well done!"

I rarely go on professional tours, but now I wonder if I have been missing out. Sure, I can see all these things on my own, but all my information would be from Wikipedia. I was so impressed with Andres, who is very friendly, professional and personable. At the start of the tour, he asked me what I was interested in and he was able to customize his approach accordingly. I found the information that he shared extremely interesting and entertaining. I especially enjoyed his stories in the Recoleta Cemetery. The lunch was also quite good. Also, if Spanish is not your first language and you choose to take the tour in Spanish, Andres has a very clear accent and is easy to understand. It would have been impossible for me to get so much out of my first day in Buenos Aires without Andres. I am a teacher, so I will say A++++++++++++++++++++++++++!"

We were collected from our hotel by Andres in plenty of time. He and his partner, who has a very good command of English, drove us to the Delta, giving us a lot of local information and stopping on route for a walk around the fruit market. We then spent an hour on Andres\u2019 boat. We were the only guests, so it was like travelling with friends. The boat has a cover, so you don\u2019t need to worry about the weather. We enjoyed going through the narrow waterways that public boats don\u2019t use. I think that we got a much clearer idea of what life is like in the area than we would have gained with a larger tour group. The whole trip lasted four hours. It was very relaxing and informative. We did this on the day we arrived in Buenos Aires; it was the ideal way to start our holiday. We then went on a cruise. On the day the ship docked in Buenos Aires, Fabien collected us from the port and took us on a full day\u2019s tour of the city, which was excellent. Fabien has a very good standard of English and is very keen to ensure that his guests get the most out of their trip and so tailors how much time is spent in each part of the city to their interests. We have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this company."

We started off in BA and visited several amazing places including the Recoleta cemetery, La Boca, and a very poignant memorial by the river to the \"disappeared\". Later in the afternoon we drove up to the Tigre delta where we boarded Andres' boat. We then spent an hour or so exploring life in the islands. Apart from all the delta residences we also saw school boats, police boats, even a store boat! Some friends joined us in BA a few days later and on my recommendation, we all did the BA city tour with Fabien. Overall, we were thoroughly impressed with Andres' and Fabien's knowledge and enthusiasm. These tours are like spending a day with a friend showing you the sights of his home town.Cultura Cercana is a wonderful way to see BA and environs at a pace that suits your needs. The company is government licensed (not all companies are) and the vehicles are new, replaced every few years. Pick up and drop off is at the door step of wherever you are staying, so the convenience is unbeatable. These tours are very highly recommended!"

We didn't end up booking anything before we left, which we probably should have done but it worked out perfectly for us. Fabian worked his magic and was able to get us a great guide.We did a city tour yesterday with Alberto. He is a very intelligent, knowledgeable and curtious young man. He arrived on time with a driver and greeted us. We couldn't believe the wealth of information he had to offer. His strongest area of expertise is politics as he graduated from university in international studies. So if this is an interest for you I would definitely recommend him. His English was great! And he can speak Japanese fluently, and some Korean, Mandarin and French. During the tour he also provided a place to change your money at a good rate. He was able to bargain for you when purchasing items off the street. He brought us to a nice steak house for lunch called Happenings by the river (not puerto madero location) and provided us with a recommendation for a great seafood and pasta restaurant called Sottevece in Puerto Madero for dinner. And at the end of the tour he said we could email him if we wanted any other recommendations or if we had any questions.We were lucky to have done the tour on a Sunday as traffic is a lot lighter. He said we probably wouldn't have been able to see g much as we did if it was during the week as you spend a lot of time in traffic moving from one place to another. If you enjoy markets, we would recommend to do the tour on the weekend as the markets are only on the weekend. However if you like to spend a lot of time checking those sorts of things out I would go back, especially if you want to get more in on the tour or do the tour on a Saturday so you can leisurely check out the markets on Sunday.We were fortunate enough to have nobody around when we went to Evita's grave. People tend to not be able to find it as her family name is in her maiden name. Alberto said its not that common to have nobody there. It was great because throughout the whole tour I found that we would arrive just before areas got super busy and as we were leaving different locations the crowds would start rolling in.All in all we were very happy with Alberto and Cultura and would highly recommend them to our friends and family."

We had pre-arranged several private tours with Cultura Cercana. Unfortunately our trip was marred by several mishaps including friends cancelling the trip at the last minute, several missed and changed ports, etc. Silvia, at Cultura Cercana, was EXTREMLEY accommodating, flexible, and very easy to deal with thru several crises. The highlight of our trip was a day long tour of Buenos Aires. Our guide, Antonella, was a GEM! She was everything a tour guide should be, (but usually isn't). Very intelligent, knowledgeable, candid, personable, funny, flexible and seemed to really enjoy what she was doing. By the end of the tour we all wanted to adopt her. Highly reccommended!"

            "review": "Fantastic tour of Buenos Aires with Laura. We booked a private tour with Cultura Cercana before we arrived to join a South American cruise on Celebrity Infinity. Laura picked the four of us (2 couples) up in her very comfortable people carrier from the Buenos Aires (BA) cruise terminal at 9 a.m. and we spent the next 7 hours being shown the delights of the city. Reading her previous excellent reviews on Tripadvisor I can only confirm that all the plaudits she has received are fully justified. With her perfect English she has a natural charm and being a \"local\" she provided great insights in the real history, culture and way of life in BA. We covered nearly all districts within the city and there are far too many highlights to list here. Laura was patient, courteous and nothing was too much trouble. It was obvious she proud of BA and her infectious enthusiasm rubbed off on us. She allowed us plenty of time to take photos and lead us on short walking tours where we saw some of the delightful quirky side of BA. She also provided us with some great local stories to give us an insight into the local way of life in BA. We lunched on some great local \"empanadas\" meeting some of the locals and we even had time to visit local craft shops and cafes. We had such a great day with lots of excellent memories that we were sad to leave BA. If you ever go to Buenos Aires make sure you book Laura to show you around."

            "review": "Fantastic Mini Tour During Airport Transfer. We were flying from El Calafate to Santiago via Buenos Aires and instead of taking a taxi from the local airport to the international airport, we asked Cultura Cercana if they could provide a mini 2-3 hour tour of Buenos Aires and then transfer us to the airport. They suggested that a whole day or at least a half day tour is advisable but they were willing to accommodate our request at a very good price.As soon as we arrived at AEP (local airport), Laura was there to greet us and she asked what we would like to see since it was a customizable tour. I said any place except La Recoleta since that would take up too much of our short time. Laura took us by car to several places for a \"drive-by\" visit and we saw Casa Rosada where I was able to get out of the car to take some pictures. We drove a good part of 9 de Julio which is the widest road in the world where we saw Theatro Colon and the Obelisk. My kids said they were hungry and Laura suggested we stop in La Boca where we had a very nice walk in the \"touristy\" section and saw a lot of outdoor cafes with live tango dancing. We had a quick bite to eat (very tasty empanadas) and took some pictures and left for the international airport.Laura was very professional, full of knowledge and history of Buenos Aires and very excited to show the places. She speaks perfect english and is a fantastic tour guide. We discussed many interesting topics from current Argentinian politics to the world cup in Brazil. If and when we ever return to Buenos Aires, we will surely request Laura to guide us again......this time for more than 2-3 hours."

It was easy to book with Silvia by e-mail and we were promptly provided with complete info. Laura picked us up in a private car at our hotel. She was a delight and spoke excellent English. We spent much of the morning touring Teatro Colon and surrounding area. It was great to have the car it was over 100 degrees this day plus one of our party wasn't feeling well. She found places for us to visit that were only a short walk or she would drop us off and pick us up. We spent almost the entire afternoon in Recoleta Cemetery. Her in depth knowledge of the cemetery was amazing. Could have spent the entire day there listening to her stories about those buried there. She did all we asked and more. Highly recommend this well run company and Laura as a guide. First class A++ all the way!"

BA City Day tour with Fabian, great guy, knows everything about the city esp places that you could never learn or go on your own. Delta Tigre with Marta and Andreas. When you go on his personal boat, to his own house/farm where he lives and grew up, what more can you ask for? Real culture and country. His partner Marta is terrific and a Tango Instructor which is why we also did the Feeling Tango tour. Don't go to a commercial Tango show, see the real thing with real people in a real club. A whole other world and not to be missed. Did the Colonia Uraguay tour with Bruno. Fantastic, so easy to see another country while in BA. He's a resident of Uraguay, full of facts and fun. Like touring with old friends, can't imagine doing it any other way. So worth the money it's crazy to not use them! Highly recommended, makes the trip hassle free and a lifetime memory."

We had a flawless tour with Fabian. We were very glad that he gave up his day off (Dec 23) to take us on tour. He has excellent English (studied and worked in the USA), and is very knowledgeable. He worked hard with his driver in an comfortable air conditioned minibus to give our family group (ten persons, ages 16-85) a great experience despite the raging hot weather (37 Celsius= 99 F). He paced the tour to visit the busiest sites early on so that we could avoid the crowds. Fabian was extremely attentive to my 85 year old parents, to be sure that they were not physically taxed. He was able to balance that with making the tour engaging and interesting. For lunch he took us to a restaurant famous for empanadas, very tasty. I highly recommend this company based on our experienc with Fabian and his driver."

We had seen a few sights on our own the day before, so he made sure we saw everything else on our list including the Thurs. 3:30 pm walk of the Mothers with missing children in the mall near the pink palace.

They picked us up at the ship, and were there EARLY, something not common on this trip! Our guides, Andres & Milta, had a car big enough to handle our luggage, so we did not need to waste time getting a day room somewhere. They took us all over the city, including a stop at a local restaurant for amazing empanadas. At the end of the day they dropped us at the airport in plenty of time for our evening flight home. The people who had stayed with the ship group arrived barely in time due to bad traffic that Andres had anticipated. Having two guides was wonderful...it allowed us to hop out at different sites while Andres drove to find parking or simply waited for us. None of this would have been possible in a big group. We felt they made the very best use of our time in Buenos Aires and that we learned a lot about their history & culture as well as making two new friends! Working with the internet was great and we were very clear about pick-up site & times. Just a great experience....thank you!!"

Fabian & Silvia & Luciano helped us with our questions and plans & always returned emails very promptly.Fabian picked us up at the airport when we arrived in Buenos Aires & took us to our hotel.

Our third day was the tour to Colonia, Uruguay with Bruno was was fantastic. Fabian picked us up for the transfer to the ferry & was waiting for us when we returned to Buenos Aires. We did the golf cart tour of Colonia with Bruno which was perfect. Colonia is so different from Buenos Aires & very worthwhile to visit. When we left Argentina, Fabian even picked us up at the domestic airport & drove us to the international airport for our flight home.One night we did the Tango lesson & then went to 2 milongas to observe the culture. This was a very interesting evening for us - we don't have anything like this in the US. Our guides were Andreas and Mirta & both were wonderful & great fun - also need to mention that they are amazing dancers and teachers!The most challenging part of this trip was the Argentine peso issue. However, Fabian & Luciano helped us as best as they could but this was still confusing to us.

We decided to opt for private tours during our cruise, as this allowed us to custom design our places of interest. Searching Tripadvisor for competent, safe, reliable and knowledgable companies, we found Cultura Cercana. Contacting them was easy, their reply was prompt and from the beginning communication was never an issue. Silvia and her group, customed designed our points of interest, provided us with exact locations for meeting up with our tour guide(s), provided safe and comfortable vehicles for our family of 4 and mostly, insured that our safety was their priority. In all locations, Buenos Aires and Punta del Este, our tour guides were knowledgable, friendly, experienced and provided us with as much cultural experience/touring that one could take in during a cruise stop over. In our opinion, Cultura Cercana was fantastic in providing us with a wonderful experience in these locations, and we want to personally thank our tour guides: Antonella, Fabian (Buenos Aires), and Bruno (Punta del Este) for contributing to our fantastic-educational visit to their beautiful countries. Travelling to South American was a trip of a lifetime and for those who are considering a trip there, you will be extremely satisfied with the services provided by Cultura Cercana Private Tours."

My family and I had two days of Buenos Aires city tour (normal and side B) and had the pleasure to be guided by Fabian and Alberto.Fabian, a very experienced guide from Cultura, is very accomodating to our requests, we spent quite some time to hunt for a mobile SIM card provider store that can give nano-SIM for iPhone 5 but he was upbeat and positive all the way (I was already about to give up). He brought us to La Brigada for a nice Argentinian BBQ (Asado) and took us to a few very nice wine shops (we planned to buy some to bring back). Fabian's english is good, he can also speak Portuguese.Alberto, although younger, already commands great knowledge about his beloved city. His English is very good, perhaps better than Fabian. He also spoke Japanese and understand a little Chinese as well. He goes out and beyond a regular tour guide's duty when he actually involves his family (brother and father) in search for the best wines (not just the most expensive) of Argentina for us to buy. I agree with the other reviewer that raves about Alberto. He was the best guide we ever had in the few weeks we travel all around latin america.Kudos to Silvia and the Cultura Cercana team for the easy communication and prompt responses."

The last leg of our cruise ended in Buenos Aires and we have arranged for a private tour with Cultura Cercana, like what we have arranged similar private tour in Montevideo and Punta del este. At BA, we were assigned Alberto - a young, energetic, pleasant and knowledgeable guide, someone who make us feel like friends. During the 8-hour tour of the city, we managed to visit all the important sights - downtown with the Plaza de Mayo, Casa Rosada, Cabildo, Metroplitan Cathedral, Recoleta cemetary, Puerto Madero, La Boca, San Telmo, Palermo and many more. When our tour ended and we were back to the ship, we realized that we left a parcel in the van. We contacted Alberto and he promised to send it to our hotel the next day. Indeed, he came back to the hotel after his work to return to us. For those who are travelling in a group and visiting Punta del Este, Montevideo and Buenos Aires, I would highly recommend to use Cultura Cercana for your tour arrangement. From my experience, I find them to be reliable and professional and I can rest assured that all have been well taken care of before the start of my vacation. Thanks to Silvia Setti from the Booking Support and Customer Service for all the assistance and advice provided in making our tour a very memorable one."

He provided an extremely clean and safe car. The taxi drivers are crazy scary in B.A. but we felt very safe with Luciano. He also set up a tango lesson one evening for us followed by a trek out to a local milonga club. It was an amazing experience! I would highly recommend this service."

The first was a tour of the Tigre delta. We took a boat ride with Andres to his home, a lttle ranch on the river. He and Mirta provided information throughout the day and were most generous with this. Andres cooked a fine lunch for us and he and Mirta gave us a tango lesson. These are genuinely nice people that I would like to call friends. We had a wonderful and relaxing day on the river and got a sense as to how Portenos spend their leisure time. We also did a full day tour of Buenos Airtes with Laura. She is incredibly knowledgeable of the city and an excellent ambassador. She showed us the highlights of the various districts and was an excellent guide and another nice person. We saw more in one day with her than we would have seen in a week by ourselves. This is a reliable and honest company and I would recommend them to anyone visiting Buenos Aires."

I highly recommend this tour to others coming to BA without a lot of experience in the city yet. He brought us all around the city and we had a very nice lunch at Caf\u00e9 Margot in Barrio de Boedo. Fabian knows the history and politics of the city and is very eager to share his knowledge with others. The highlight for me was a trip to the Boca neighborhood - I probably took 300 pics of this colorful area. My husband's highlight was the Recoleta cemetery. I was also very interested in the stories he told about Eva Peron's legacy and the Mothers of Playo Mayo. If you are looking to change your USD for Pesos and get an exchange rate better than the ATM (5:1), Fabian recommended a safe place in a mall in Boca to change our dollars to peso and we got an 8:1 exchange rate. Fabulous! Thanks again Fabian!"

Fabi\u00e1n showed us all around the city, pointing out unusual locations. He also discussed with us fascinating information on life as a Porte\u00f1o, Argentine politics and Rioplatense (the brand of Spanish spoken in BA). We ate at a nice cafe (Caf\u00e9 Margot in Barrio de Boedo) frequented primarily by locals, and ate sandwiches \"de pavita en escabeche\" (tasty marinated turkey on your choice of several different breads). We were very impressed with Fabi\u00e1n ...he was friendly, patient and full of information.A few days later we spent several hours with Shalako in Montevideo. He, too, was very friendly, informative and more than willing to answer our many questions about life, politics, and history in Uruguay. We had a great meal in the Mercado del Puerto, browsed some neat used bookstores on Trist\u00e1n Narvaja street, visited Librer\u00eda Puro Verso, a book shop in an elegant renovated pharmacy, saw the Centennial Futbol (Soccer) Stadium, and heard a lot about Pe\u00f1arol...his favorite team.Overall, we were very pleased with Cultura Cercana, Fabi\u00e1n and Shalako. We highly recommend booking a personalized tour with them. It's well worth it."

Laura introduced us to the city, pointing out many of the highlights. She was able to help us make decisions about which places we would want to return to and spend more time at on our own. In addition, she took us to see things that we would not have gotten to on our own. She even helped us to find a street where many of the houses were decorated with mosaics that my husband had read about, but that Laura herself was not familiar with. It was great to have such a knowledgeable guide who was willing to adapt the tour to our interests. We highly recommend Cultura Cercana and especially our guide, Laura!"

            "review": "So glad we chose Cultura. We had never used a private tour company before, but felt that with just 5 days in Buenos Aires combined with our inability to speak Spanish - that we'd learn and see more of what we wanted to see with a private guide. After reading the reviews on TA and looking at companies web-sites we chose Cultura and so glad we did. We arranged for pick-up from the airport, a full day tour of Buenos Aires, an evening tango show, transfers to our ship, as well as private tours in Montevideo and Punta Del Este in Uruguay. I found working with just one company in multiple countries is so much easier. And from the moment we arrived at the airport, we knew we were in good hands. While many companies simply have drivers congregate in the entry hall, all holding signs and you spend time looking for yours, Cultura instead arranges to meet at one of the several private booths just outside the baggage claims area, It's a small but appreciated touch after a long flight. Our guide in Buenos Aires was Laara, she was personable,very knowlegeable and was easy to see that she loves what she does. She had an innate sense of what we were looking for and was able to manage time available so we could see key sights plus a few special interests. We love architecture and she made sure we were able to see some incredible buildings and homes. She also shared both keen and funny insights on life in Beunos Aires. Our tour was both by van and walking, we spent time in Boca, Recoleta, touring the cememtary, Puerto Madryn, San Telmo, an amazing bookstore that used to be a theatre, as well as Cafe Tortoni. The day of our tour was a Thursday and were also lucky enough to see the May mothers - who have been protesting every week since the 70', it's a fasacinating story. She chose a great local place for lunch that we never would have found on our own, the day just flew by and we really felt like we got to know and understand more of the people, culture and history of BA... After experiencing the Cultura service, they have now set the standard (for me) in what to expect from a private guide... I would defintely recommend and use their services again."

Our guide, Laura, was great, from her knowledge of Buenos Aires itself to her expanded knowledge about Argentina as a whole. She was very personable and her English was fantastic. She made sure to ask us what we were interested in seeing and then tailored the tour to our interests. She even helped us arrange to go see a soccer match, but unfortunately the company that we used for the soccer match (Conexionbaires.com) (which Laura readily admitted she had not used before) was absolutely horrible and I would strongly recommend not doing anything with Conexionbaires.com (they have a stand in La Boca). But back to Cultura Cercana - they are a small but wonderful tour company and a tour with them on one of your first days in Buenos Aires is definitely worth it (if not just to help you plan out the rest of your days)."

We flew in a day early and wanted to see some of Buenos Aires the day we landed. Because of the very positive reviews on TripAdvisor, we booked a day tour with Cultura Cercana who agreed to pick us up at the airport, tour the city, and drop us off in the evening at our overnight hotel. In a single word, our experience with this company was Excellent ! All preliminary tour set up was handled via email and PayPal with Cultura Cercana. Everything was explained and all questions were answered. As for the tour, our guide Laura was waiting for us at the airport, even though it took over 90 minutes to clear customs and immigration. Once she had us in her car we started out on a long day of sightseeing. We had no particular plans, so we asked Laura to show us whatever she felt was important to see in the city and she came up with many, many fascinating places to go. Along the way, she constantly reacted to our likes and interests, even helping us with our Spanish language pronunciation ! As long time football (soccer) fans, we even had some common ground to discuss with someone from this football mad country. Especially memorable was our tour of the La Recoleta cemetery, something I would not have imagined would interest us. Along about 6 PM we were feeling the effects of overnight travel and asked Laura to cut the tour short (9:30 to 6) and take us to the hotel. I think she would have continued the tour as long as we wished. In summary, we feel that we had an extremely positive experience dealing with Cultura Cercana and especially with Laura, our guide in Buenos Aires."

And I waited too long to contact Cultura Cercana--they were booked for one of the days that we wanted to book them. So we asked them to custom plan an evening tour of Buenos Aires, to combine the evening city views with a taste of Buenos Aires tango. They were very accommodating, even though they did not have a \"package\" tour like we wanted. We also asked Cultura to schedule a tour of nearby Colonia, Uruguay. We scheduled a day tour of Buenos Aires with another agency for the day that Cultura was booked. The Cultura Cercana arrangements were perfect, and so were our guides. The price was very reasonable.Our guides for the evening tour of Buenos Aires were Mirta and Andres, both of whom are Tango instructors. They are very knowledgeable of the city, they are wonderful guides, and they are as accommodating as anyone could possibly ask. It was like visiting the city with old friends who proudly showed off Buenos Aires as only its long term residents know it: not a superficial \"touristy\" overview but an opportunity to enjoy local venues and cultures and participate with the locals as much, or as little, as we wanted to. The ferry ride from Buenos Aires to Colonia is easy and fun; the tour of Colonia was also fun. Bruno, our guide, is a charming young man who seemed like he might have been our son's best friend; we were just that comfortable with him and he was that much fun to be with. Like Andres and Mirta, Bruno proudly displayed his city with charm and candor. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our time with all three of our Cultura guides. They seem much more like our friends than our guides. Frankly, if we go back to Buenos Aires, it will probably be as much to see Andres, Mirta, and Bruno as it will be to travel and to see Argentina and Uruguay.I had read superlative comments on TravelAdvisor about Cultura Cercana before booking with them, and I thought that the comments were probably exaggerated. They are not. Andres, Mirta, and Bruno are really that good. Unfortunately, we had to schedule our day tour with another organization; it was not good at all. My wife and I actually asked to be taken back to our hotel early. I guess we just got spoiled by the Cultura guides!"

We took Delta Tigre tour with them. Andres and Mirta were our guides. Both are English speaking, knowledgeable and pleasant to deal with. We were a group of 7, so they arranged 2 cars for us (which was wonderful, we did not have to be crowded in one car), picked us u right from our apartment, drove to the Tigre, then we took Andres\u2019 boat and had a wonderful tour in Argentinian \"Venice\". Then we were taken to Andrea's cute little house and had a homemade lunch! Mirta and Andres danced tango for us and gave us a lesson too!

Laura was outstanding. She filled the day with all the highlights and history and you felt like you were spending the day with an old friend. She was willing to change the intinerary if there was something special you wanted to do. She even helped us with securing tickets for a day trip to Colonia. It would be hard to imagine someone doing a better job of making a visitor feel more at home! We were also lucky to have Andres along to add some tango spice to the day. Friends who came into BA later in the week also toured with Laura and enjoyed the same great experience that my wife and I did!We next utilized Bruno in Colonia. He meet us at the ferry and like Laura he is warm and personable and made the day fly by. His knowledge not only about Colonia but the history of Uruguay and its ties with Argentina painted a terrific historical picture of the region. After almost a week in BA the peace and quiet of Colonia was a most welcome sight. He is the go to guide for Colonia and Montevideo!Lastly we used CC for a late night visit to a milonga for an evening of Tango with Andres and his dance partner Mirta. While we only spent a few hours with them at a local spot they were warm and comfortable to be around. The explained the history of tango and what is currently going on in the area. We were able to watch them strut their several times on the dance floor. A great way to end our week in BA.Overall we cannot recommend CC highly enough. They covered all the bases with care and consideration and made our week in the area a highly enjoyable one. Thank you CC."

Four of the tours were with Cultura. The first was in Punta Arenas, Chile. Our guide Roberto picked us up at the port and we went to the Seno Otway penquin colony. He also took us to the cemetary to see the elaborate mausoleums, and the Braun-Menendez house museum, as well as the main square. Roberto was very accommodating, and even took us to a grocery store so we could buy wine. Our guide in Buenos Aires was Laura. She spoke excellent English and was a very good guide. She knows the city and history very well and had a good itinerary planned. We were fortunate that it was a holiday on our tour day, and we had little traffic and were able to see Casa Rosada, the presidential palace. She also took us for lunch at Care Tortoni, a famour coffee shop from 1858.In Montevideo we met Bruno. He had been our correspondent for booking all the tours, and also does guiding himself. I cannot say enough good things about Bruno. He gave us a very good tour of Montevideo, pointing out some really interesting things that we would otherwise have missed. He was not happy with our service at lunch (the restaurant missed orders, gave wrong orders, and was really slow). He arranged for us to have our lunch for free, and extended our tour time so we would not miss anything! Bruno was also our guide in Punta del Este. This is a beautiful resort area and we saw the town and some of the beaches. Bruno took it upon himself to find out that the Ralli Museum, which is private, had been opened up for the other cruise passengers, and he took us there as a surprise! Another highlight was Casa Pueblo, the home, restaurant, hotel, time share, and studio of artist Carlos Paez Vilaro. This was also a very worthwhile place to visit. Thank you Bruno.I definitely recommend booking tours with Cultura - we were very satisfied and would use Cultura again if we are lucky enough to visit South America again in the future."

We had communicated with Brunos with Cultura Cerana for several months as we planned our trip to explore southern South America Chile & Argentina. We were planning to spend several days in the Chilean Lake District before boarding the Seabourn Sojourn. We wanted to do private tours on all the cruise stops. Than we planed to spend several days in Buenos Aires as wells as visit Iguazo Falls. We used Cultura in numerous parts of Chile & Argentina on this trip and they all were excellent (see below). In Buenos Aires, our first experience was when they picked us up from the airport as we returned from Iguazo Falls. We had some miss communication when we got off our ship on Sunday and needed to get to the Jorge Newbery Airport to catch our flight to Iguazo falls but we managed to get there. To make it up the owner Luciano picked us up at the airport with his associates Andres & Mirta. He gave us their Tigre Tour which was fantastic. We drove from the airport past where the tourist tour boats to a private marina where Andres had his boat. We than boated through the canals seeing the homes, churches, schools and even a floating grocery stor. We got to Andres home and enjoyed some wondeful appetizers and drinks. Afterwards we took a walk throiugh the island seeing how the neighbors lived. When we returned we had a wonderful meal that Andres prepared. The vegetables were incredible. As night came and the stars came out. Andres & Mirta who made a wonderful Flam desert shared their experiences in living in Buenos Aires. It was a clear night so we looked at the stairs as we prepared to leave. The Southern Cross, Orien, etc were bright and you could appreciate what early explorers saw.The next day we meet Laura who gave us a wonderful tour of the city. From the Pink House,La Boca, Palermo neighborhoods, a wonderful lunch and a tomb by tomb tour of the Cemetary Recoleta including Eva Peron's tomb. It was a rich and fasinating tour and Laura is the best. She can explain the history and culture. She will custom the tour depending on what you want to see. She is a great guide.That night we did the delux Tango tour with Andres & Mirta. They gave us a private lesson in the basic steps of tango and explained \"Show Tango\" vs tango. After the lessons we drove into another neighborhood to join a Milango which is like a dance club with a couple hundred dancers dancing to a DJ spinning the different tango songs which create different tangos. It was another late night but again you experienced the real culture not just a tourist show.The next day we took the ferry across the River Plate to Colonia in Uruguay and reconnected with Bruno. We had a great time exploring Colonia which was settled by the Portuguese. I love history and Bruno is well versed. We visited a small family winery which was a lot of fun. I bought a wonderful bottle of a Merlot wine. Did you know the world record for the most #2 pencils is held by a farmer outside of Colonia? What a collection.The next day Laura picked us up early at the Hilton and took us out to International airport EZE.We had a great experienced everyday and felt we were treated as family like a distant Aunt & Uncle coming to visit.Other Places Where Cultura took care of us.We first meet Bruno when we did a tour with him in Montevideo, Uruguay. Unfortunately the Sojourn was an hour late docking. It was easy to meet Bruno as we got off the ship and walked out of the port. Bruno took us to the main plaza and spent about 6 hours showing off his beautiful city. We had a wonderful lunch with Uruguay beef & chicken which was one of the best meals of our 22 day trip. A great tour of a beautiful city that you should consider if you visit there.We also used Cultura to book our tour off the ship in Ushuaia. Our guide there was Gaston who was an expert on the birds and other wild life. It was full day tour that gave us highlites of the city plus we drove into the interior to see the valley's & lakes.They provided our guide for a day tour off the Sojourn at Chacabuco, Chile. The nature of that port means you will do a lot of driving to see anything. It was nice but not really memorable. The guide was good but just not a great deal to see. Although the Bar B Q lamb I had for lunch was a highlight.We also booked a guide Claudio when we stayed in Puerto Varas, Chile. Claudio and his wife took care of us from Friday until we got on the ship Monday mid day in Puerto Montt and than we met them the next day in Castro Chile. Claudio is a wonderful guide and his wife Ingrid is a pleasure. We explored Frutallar the first day. The second day we went to the river Petrohue, Rosales National Park, plus went up on Volano Osorno. The third day we went to the island of Chiloe and along the North coast saw some of the churches plus our first penguins at Punihuil.On the fourth day, we visited Puerto Montt and the fish market there. Puerto Montt is where the industry is located so it was not a charming as Puerto Varas.Again we meet Claudio & Ingrid as we got off the Sojourn and we explored the area around Castro seeing churches including one being restored that Claudio arranged. Which for me was really neat and very special. We also visited a boat builder to see how using wood they still build boats- very special. My last comments there were a couple of spots that Cultura could accomidate our needs and they refered us to other sources that were excellent.Thanks to Luciano, Bruno, Claudio & Ingrid, Laura, Andres, Mirta, Gaston for a wonderful trip."

Again we all agreed that this was a wonderful evening and certainly recommend it to anyone wanting to get a feel for \u2018real\u2019 tango (versus the staged performances at the tango shows).Colonia. This was a full-day tour providing a much different experience from Buenos Aires. We took an early ferry (8:45) from BA to Colonia that is in Uruguay, about 45 miles across the Rio de la Plata. Our guide, Bruno, met us at the ferry terminal in Colonia. Bruno was great \u2013 a young local man studying anthropology who was humorous, personable, and very knowledgeable. The tour included a walking excursion around central Colonia, lunch at a local restaurant of our choice, a visit to the local bullring, a winery tour and tasting, and a visit to a unique museum. The history of the area narrated by Bruno was fascinating."

We did almost all of the essential sites in a timely manner. What made the trip special was Pablo himself. He has a wealth of information to share. He is a very patriotic Argentinian with many opinions he was happy to share all day. There was no question we asked that went unanswered. He is a charming young man. We were lucky to have chosen this company and draw Pablo. By the end of the day, we had learned a lot about Buenos Aires and Argenina in general.The van was roomy, with an excellent sound system. We were taken to lunch at a neighborhood bistro absent of tourists except for us. We left the ordering to Pablo. Another good decision. Great typical B.A. fare.A wonderful day!"

Bruno was amazing to deal with. he gave us options in each of these ports and provided us with outstanding local guides. Gaston in Ushuaia was knowledgeable and clearly had a love of nature sharing all the wonderful scenery outside of the city. We would never have had the chance to experience what we did if we had simply stayed in Ushuaia. Ingrid in Purto Montt, also a local took us on a tour to Osorno Volcana and Petrohue Falls. What a day. Pictures cannot properly show the magnificance of the area. Do not hesitate to use Cultura Cercana for all your port destinations!!"

As we got out of port Andres was waiting for us with his big smile. He is a very nice and enthousiastic man. He had organised transportation for our luggage to be sent to our hotel as we left to meet his partner. We met Mirta at the marina, she was very inviting. What a joy to spend the day with such a lovely couple. They prepared a wounderful lunch. Picada and their famous ravioli was on the menu. Mirta suprised us with her cr\u00e8me caramel accompanied with dulce de leche. We finished the afternoon with a tango lesson. I would recommend this tour to anyone planning on visiting Buenos Aires. We have made new friends in Argentina. As for Cultura Cercana, these are plaisant people to deal with. Thank you."

He spent time up front talking with us about where we had already been, what our interests were, and what we wanted to make sure and see. He tailored our day perfectly, combining park visits with Recoleta, La Boca, and an excellent out-of-the-way lunch with the locals. Fabian was extremely knowledgable and personable. His quote of the Argentinian people still sticks with me, \"Argentinians are Italians who speak Spanish and think they are French.\" Getting set up with a guide for just the two of us was an excellent way to spend the day and get an authentic flavor of Argentina.Cultura Cercana was excellent to work with, used secure methods of electronic payment, had great follow through and even helped us get a reservation for Tango. If you are searching the web and trying to decide who to work with or book with for your visit to Buenos Aires, stop now and save yourself some time. This is the place!"

Everyone of them made their tour area come alive for us, with interesting history bits and anecdotes that we wouldn't have heard about any other way. Luciano was a wonderful organizer and sent us fantastic detailed info for every stop on meeting points and guides' cell phone numbers, etc. They all came in very handy more than once. And then, they put us in contact with another great tour operator in Chile, that turned out to be just as excellent.Wonderful job, reasonable and so enjoyable. I recommend them highly!

There was a group of 10 gals from Nova Scotia, Canada, cruising on the Azamera Quest on a South America cruise from Rio de Janiero to Buenos Aires from January 5-15, 2013 and we booked Ciltura Cercana Tours for our stops in Montevideo and Buenos Aires. On January 12 we booked a 3 hour walking tour of Montevideo and we were so lucky to have Shalako as our guide. He has a wonderful personality and his passion for his country of Uruguay was apparent throughout the tour. We had an absolutely wonderful time with him and we wanted to bring him home with us. Whenever one of us would like to stop at one of the markets he had no problem waiting for us to have a look around and buy some things. I told him my daughter was very involved in soccer so Shalako made sure he found a place for me to buy the official jersey for the Uruguay team. My daughter was thrilled to get this. Thank you so much Shalako and Cultura Cercana Tours is so very lucky to have you on their team. Thanks Shako for the great memories!! You are in the right business!We then arrived in Buenos Aires on January 13, 2013 and were met promptly at the port by Fabian. We did a full day tour with Fabian and we are still amazed at what he was able to show us. We saw all the big attractions and even had time for a wonderful lunch which Fabian booked for us. We saw the Recolleta cemetery, La Boca, San Telmos, President's Palace, Artisan's market, etc. Fabian was fantastic!! We loved both Shalako and Fabian. It was great to meet Bruno as well and thank you Bruno for ensuring our expectations were met and then some.Highly highly recommend Cultura Cercana and if you are fortunate enough to get Shalako and/or Fabian you receive an added bonus:):):)"

I had a 10+ hour layover in Buenos Aires, so I contacted Cultura Cercana about a private tour, asking if anyone else had a tour the same day and might like to share in order to reduce expenses. (All the private tours in BA are pricey, regardless of the tour operator.) They were wonderful in working with me to book a shared tour with another traveler. Then, to my chagrin, my flight times changed and I could no longer do the shared tour. They were very understanding, despite this being a royal pain in the neck for everyone. I ended up booking a private tour anyway.Unfortunately, my flight into BA was late, so that cut out some of the time I would have had to see more. Pablo was there waiting at the airport and I immediately felt like we had been friends for a long time. A demonstration going on in the city also cut down on the time we had to see the sights. However, I felt like seeing the demonstrators and hearing about the issues they were protesting helped me get a good feel for the real Argentina. The driving tour (with some walking and a stop at a local restaurant for an amazing steak) was whirlwind, but I did get a good sense of BA and I loved hanging out with Pablo. I almost felt dirty giving him money at the end of the tour--as if I was paying an escort instead of a guide! :) I had a very enjoyable tour, although I was disappointed not to have more time to see and experience more of the city. Cultura Cercana provided great service before & during the tour and I would recommend them. They always responded to my email questions quickly and they bent over backwards to accommodate my changing travel plans. Pablo was very friendly, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable. We never stopped talking during the entire time we were together. One thing that I was unsure of, so I would suggest thinking about this & asking ahead of time, was whether I was expected to pay for the guide's meal when we stopped to eat."

The tour is highly personalized. Depending on your interests(me and my husband were very interested in the political history of the city), Laura will tailor the sights and the information.

One of the Highlights of the day was the tour through the Casa Rosada.Luciano was great and we recommend the tour.In the evening, we took a \"Milonga\"show tour. Andre picked us up at the dock and took us to the milonga which was located quite a distance away. So we had a nice tour of the town on the way there and back. The milonga was located in a neighborhood \u201chall\u201d, similar to a church hall with a stage. We sat at a little reserved table located around the edge of the dance floor.Our guide, Andre, was a tango instructor and he brought his partner, Milda. They explained the tango and answered our questions all evening..about a wide variety of subjects.The dancing begins at 9pm and ends around 3am. We told them that we were ready to go after a few hours. They were very accommodating and would have stayed as long as we wanted to. The people in BA are late night people and we are not.What was really unique about this tour was that we were the only tourists in the room. One of the locals was having a birthday party so he shared his birthday cake with us.This was not a show, it was local people who were excellent tango dancers dancing in their neighborhood.I would say that this was one of the highlights of our South American trip."

My husband and I had a private half-day tour with Fabian on Christmas Day (we had asked for Christmas Eve, but apparently 12/25 worked better for Cultura Cercana, and we were happy to change). Given that it was Christmas Day and most Portenos were busy preparing for the holiday with their friends and family, we were extremely appreciative of Fabian's time with us. Also because of the holiday, pretty much the entire city was shut down, so we were able to zoom around town in Fabian's car without any traffic. Fabian was so shocked to find such great parking spaces in the tourist centers of town. At our request, we focused our trip on La Boca, Downtown, and Recoleta (pretty much just the cemetery). Fabian told us interesting stories about the immigrant experience and artwork in La Boca, about the political protest tradition Downtown (at the Casa Rosada, etc.), and about the specific people entombed in the Recoleta Cemetery. He shared personal stories about his own family background, too. He was very personable. He and my husband talked about soccer (sorry--futbol!) for nearly 30 minutes straight. It was a lovely morning and a great way to see the touristy sites--it was a richly interesting, personalized experience. We couldn't have asked for anything more. Thanks, Fabian!"

We learned and saw more in those 4 hours that we would have seen in an entire week or two by ourselves. Laura was friendly, kind, and extremely knowledgeable and we did not feel hurried at all, even if it was the day before Christmas. Unlike big group tours, we could ask anything and talk about anything, it was like getting a tour of this great city from a friend. In 4 hours we covered the entire city, and saw the major attractions (which is what we wanted...because remember the tour is tailored to what you want to see), and then for the rest of the week we were able to visit some of these places again on our own more in depth, but armed with the knowledge gained from Laura.Do not have any doubts, book this tour guide immediately, if it is the ONLY thing you are able to do in BA, this must be it, because you will get so much out of it.Thank you Laura for a great time, and thank you Cultura Cercana !"

A highlight was going to a local restaurant for lunch, with no other tourists in sight! The Tango tour with Andres was also very interesting, we enjoyed seeing the locals performing tango. I would suggest, if you don't know how to tango, that you do the longer deluxe tour with the lesson included. While we enjoyed watching the couples tango, it certainly wasn't a show put on for us and we would've liked to have been able to join in. We did appreciate the fact that while the website said it was a 2 hour tour, we got 4 hours total (including transportation) and probably could have got them to stay longer if we wanted. Both tours were really good value for the money."

Luciano and Pablo showed us all the usual attractions and museums as well as many other restaurants and locations people may not know about. While we were there, we truly felt like a family (pablo's band even played for us!). The guides are very friendly and are more then willing to give suggestions about what to do for the rest of your time in Buenos Aires. They also are great at giving a lot of information in a way that is interesting and relevant, but not overwhelming. Luciano and Pablo is very genuine and keeps in touch with us to see how we are doing and when we are coming back (which we are all hoping to do!). I highly recommend this tour whether you live in Buenos Aires, or are seeing it for the first time!"

We had the pleasure of Dr Luciano as our tour guide at that time. We had a very enjoyable and informational tour that provided us with the highlights of Buenos Aires. It is a huge city and difficult to see everything but we covered the most important tourist attractions and we were given additional information of places that we could visit on our own. It was a great introduction to an overwhelming city.I returned in early November, with my best friend . She had not been to Buenos Aires so I suggested the tour with Cultura Cercana. Dr Luciano was not available on the dates that we were available but he provided an excellent guide for us. Although I had been in Buenos Aires just a few months prior, the guided tour with Laura was just as satisfying and not at all redundant. Laura arrived at our hotel promptly and was ready to show us \"her city\". We talked and toured and had a wonderful experience. Laura also provided us with information about our visit to Iguazu Falls ( reminding us to take a change of clothes to the park). That information was invaluable !! She also suggested the new Tango Music show with younger musicians who have their own twist on the tango music. When we asked her about genuine Argentine cuisine , she was able to suggest a few places that we might enjoy with my daughter.All in all, I had two great experiences with Cutura Cerana and would not hestitate to reccomend them to my friends. They were very organized, had great follow through and tried very hard to accomodate our schedule."

I think, for the all day tour. We spent alot of time driving around to through several various city areas as well as an off-the-beaten-path area & restaurant. Perhaps because I had a in-depth walking tour with another providor the previous day, I had something to compare. I was disappointed with the lack of historical frame of reference of the various monuments (like the proximity of Las Malvinas war memorial in the face of the English tower) as well as the history of some of the Argentinian heroes (that San Martin died pretty much broke).So, if this was the only tour I had, maybe I would have been impressed more so, but in comparison to the others I had taken, it had less historical perspective than I desired. However, any tour from a local is better than just wandering around. I enjoyed being driven rather than walking or biking and I enjoyed the local restaurant away from the tourists. Coupled with the historical knowledge I had gained the day before, I enjoyed Fabian's tour & commentary and would reccommend this tour to anyone. They were on time, provided value for the money, courteous, friendly, down-to-earth, enjoyed showing off their city, was not 'bored' when dealing with the umpteenth same question (where is Evita's tomb?), and actually asked us what we would like to do rather than just doing the same-o same-o."

The tour covered all the main sights, such as Recoleta cemetery, the Boca neighbourhood, and various historical buildings around the city.We found Laura to be an excellent guide. She apparently has only been working as a tour guide for a short period of time, but you would never guess that, as she was very knowledgeable about all the places we visited. Furthermore, she was very friendly and had a good sense of humour. We were able to chat to her about a wide variety of things, and really enjoyed the time we spent with her.

I'm certain that we would have given the experience 5 -stars, with only Luciano. But we were especially lucky because he was training Laura - another 5 star guide. So we had two tour guides the entire afternoon. We didn't have a clue on what to see, but needed to run a quick errand at Teatro Colon. They assisted us with our errand and also took us to Boca, Casa Rosada, Cafe Tortoni, and Recoleta Cemetery. It was obvious that they would discuss whatever topics that interested us, usually with a pretty good sense of humor about it. We talked a lot about soccer and the rivalry between Boca and River Plate, and some of the differences between the fan bases. We ended up buying Boca jerseys. We were fascinated by the cemetery. It was a great background to describe some of the political and class struggles in Argentina over the past hundred years. Even though we went over our alotted time, Luciano and Laura never seemed concerned. Their love for their city was obvious. I strongly recommend this tour as the most efficient way to get a basic understanding of the city from the perspective of the locals."

We booked our tour with Andres & Mirta, who were at our hotel and waiting for us well before our 9am scheduled departure. This was a pleasant surprise for two gals who are hyper-on time. We had booked this tour after reading reviews on TA and neither are fans of \"guided\" experiences to anything. Andres and Mirta work together like a well oiled machine. They are tango partners who complete one anothers sentences like a couple who have been together for decades. We were driven from our hotel (we stayed in Palermo Hollywood) through BA and Andres gave us a nice history and explanation of the city. We were then taken to an outdoor shopping plaza where Andres & Mirta helped steer our purchases. When I saw something I liked, Andres was quick to tell me it was \"over priced\". He then guided me to a different store to find the object I had spotted at a FRACTION of the price. I couldn't believe it.From the shopping center, we boarded Andres' boat and rode the Tigre Delta for about 30 minutes until we arrived at Andres' beautiful home. He served us a 3 course lunch that was one of the best meals that we had while we were in the country. Being that I didn't have any desire to ride horses, we opted for a nice hike through the delta before our tango lesson and desert. Before we knew it, it was time for us to head back onto the boat and back to the city.Andres then took us back to our hotel. I couldn't believe it was 7pm when we arrived. We had an amazing day with Andres and Mirta and felt like we were old friends by the time the day was over. I would not only book this tour again in an instant, I would request Andres and Mirta. They are incredible, down to earth people who will make you feel like family."

He is only about 25 years old (I think), but he is full of knowledge about Buenos Aires. You can tell that he is very passionate about the history and politics of his country, and we ended up learning more about BA in those 8 hours than we did on the rest of our stay in the city. To give you an outline of the tour, Francisco drove us around in his comfortable vehicle, showing us the highlights of the city. We also got out and walked around, exploring certain areas in more detail, like the port area, Boca, and Recoletta Cemetery, as well as some other places. The highlight of the tour was the walk through the famous cemetery. The cemetery is impressive, for sure, but only with a guide do you really get the most out of the experience. Franciso told us amazing stories about many of the people buried there, from Evita to some of the lesser known occupants. We basically received a history lesson about Argentina in the cemetery, but it was all done through Francisco's great storytelling, so believe me, you will not get bored. Last tip: book this tour on your first day in Buenos Aires. You will see a lot of the city, but you will also get an idea of the places you want to go back to visit in depth, or museums, etc that you want to go into. Francisco also gave us recommendations of local things to eat, and the best restaurants to visit. So by doing the tour on your first day, you can truly take advantage of all of your guide's tips."

Well, Cultura Cercana helps you sort that out and weed out the misses. It is a great introduction to the beautiful city of Buenos Aires.One thing to note about Culutra Cercana is that they are very young. We were quite surprised when Francisco came to pick us up as this was something that was very different in that we are used to in private tours (which we always take because my mom has mobility issues). This was the first time that we have had someone younger than 30 tour us around. Don't let the youthfulness fool you however. They are great at what they do! Our day with this company was pure hits. Francisco picked us up and started our day out with great information regarding Buenos Aires. He patiently answered our questions and added others that helped us understand BA and Argentina in a way that guide books and the internet just would not be able to do. We went all around the city and Francisco waited patiently when we wanted to look around for souvenirs. He also graciously accommodated my desire to see La Bombonera and made sure that I was able to get a great photo of the stadium. He even emailed me a list of things we could do for the rest of our stay in Buenos Aires. Since he couldn't stay with us for the entirety of the tour, we ended the day with Luciano who owns the company. As with Francisco, he was very informative and animated. He let us decide on how much time we would like to spend in certain places and in general was just a great guide. The way that they both explained the city reflects their youth but the difference is that they are clearly very knowledgeable not only about the city but the world around them which makes the tour even better, in my opinion.Another great thing about Cultura Cercana is that they are so easy to contact with their website and Luciano will promptly answer emails. And the pricing is great -- most definitely bang for your buck. I could say a lot more about Cultura Cercana but instead I'll just say this instead. Stop reading now, go to their website and email to reserve a tour right away."

The positive reviews (like this one is going to be) are absolutely accurate. We spent two full days with the folks from this company, and it enhanced our trip immeasurably. Our first day was the full day driving tour of Buenos Aires, and our guide, Luciano was warm, funny, and a virtual encyclopedia of Argentine history, lore and personal tidbits of life in BA. We explored sights, monuments and neighborhoods all over the city.....but before we started, Luciano took the time to ask US questions about our interests and wishes. From the bullet holes in the buildings surrounding the Casa Rosada, to the history behind the nature preserve adjacent to Puerto Madero, to the \"real\" restaurant in an off the beaten path for lunch, he pointed things out that we would never have learned elsewhere or from some generic tour company. This tour is a must. Our second day with Cultura Cercana was equally amazing, and in fact, created lasting memories for our family that we still often talk about. We took the full day tour up to Tigre -- Andreas and Milta are truly wonderful people and we actually felt like portenos, going up to the \"country\" for a day. Stopping around San Isidro for a bit (we love real estate and wanted to see some of the spectacular homes), we arrived in the small town of Tigre and almost immediately boarded Andreas' speedboat for an incredibly ride through the winding rivers of this facinating part of the country. With literally thousands of tiny islands, many of which are lined with homes and docks, zipping around on our way to Andreas' home was a real experience. If any readers feel reluctant uneasy about visiting someone's private home, don't......these two guides make you feel so at ease, it is like you are with your own family. The house is clean and quaint -- but most of the time is spent in the outside covered living space in the back. Lunch was wonderful -- starting out with the homemade peperoni and sausages and cheeses, and followed by delicious ravioli, which is delivered daily by the \"ravioli boat\" -- there is an entire system of commerce that exists in this region, with different boats selling their wares and going from dock to dock -- good wine, good food and great people was a terrific combination. After lunch, a walk around the island, meeting a few of the locals and even having someone's puppy follow us all the way back to Andrea's house, who wound up staying with us for the rest of the day. (we nicknamed him \"Pedro\") who was heartbroken and chased our boat from along the shore when we had to leave.). What could be better? A tango lesson. Milta and Andreas are professional dancers and after a little demonstration, we actually tried ourselves and had so much fun. Eventually back to Tigre and then we were driven right back to our hotel in Recoleta. My point is that if you want to do something a little bit out of the ordinary, and have a truly amazing day, Cultura Cercana's day in Tigre is what you must do. We give our highest recommendation to this company, and to Luciano, Andreas and Milta for giving us experiences that we will remember for years."

His English was perfect and he was fun, funky, interesting, good humoured and tailored our trip specifically for us. We're Irish and BA has a rich Irish history (which I found out via Pablo!) - he has a great grasp of the Argentine-Irish connection and brought us to some really fascinating places throughout our full day tour, who knew there was so many Celtic crosses in the Recoleta cemetery? Or that Admiral Brown, the father of the Argentine Navy was from Mayo?! I would have wandered around the cemetery getting totally lost if it wasn't for Pablo and his insider knowledge. We had some great steaks and local beers during a really relaxing lunch, asked tons of questions from mate to rugby which Pablo answered patiently and got to see loads of BA during our full day tour. He was very well informed and had really excellent English. I had never gone on a private tour before but I would recommend doing so if you have a few quid to spare; I couldn't have handled being on a bus with lots of other camera wielding tourists; was great to have our own guide who 'got' what kind of tour we wanted to do.

I am sure if you are anything like me, you have been scouring the internet looking for top notch hotels, restaurants, and tours in order to make your vacation, scratch that, most likely already very expensive vacation, the best it can be. Well trust me, if you are visiting the city of Buenos Aires, you will want to make sure that you get a tour hosted by Cultura Cercana, I am lucky, my family is Argentine and have visited Argentina every year since I was a baby, however, despite my knowing spanish this time around, I was traveling with my boyfriend and he speaks very little spanish. I don't know about you, but I am not very interested in those red open top bus tours, yes they may speak your language, but they are not really that detailed and you barely even get time to take pictures! When I go somewhere, I want to know what makes the historical sights important, and I most certainly do not want to be taken to the most touristy spots in the city. Cultura Cercana will do none of this. We chose the eight hour tour, we were picked up at our hotel at promptly the time we were told they would be there, and were greeted by the tour guide (and company owner!) Luciano. Luciano has his own car (with plenty of space, for you large groups) that will take you anywhere your heart desires in the city of Buenos Aires. For example, we did the typical plaza de mayo tour with pictures in front of the Casa Rosada, however, we were there on a Saturday, so we were able to actually go inside the Casa Rosada. We saw the equivalent of the Oval Office of Argentina. Like I mentioned before, my whole family is from Argentina and I can now say that I have seen the presidential palace on the inside, before my own mother... who was born in the country! Luciano asked us where we wanted to go for lunch, and of course, we said that we wanted something off the beaten path. Meaning, a place where tourists would not be, and a place where ordinary Argentine citizens spent there lunch time at. We were taken to a place that made its own homemade beer... most excellent! My boyfriend loves artisan beer, so this place was a hit with him. We were taken all around the city, the places which interested us, as well as some places that Luciano recommended as must-sees. He is a wealth of information about the city. To be quite honest, if we lived in a world where we didn't need to pay for a roof over our heads and food on our tables, I believe Luciano would do this for free... that is how much he enjoys doing this for a living. What I mean to say with this is, he is not interested in your money, he is more interested in you enjoying your tour of his dear city and taking in all the insight that he has to give. If you have done your research about Buenos Aires, I am sure many of you have read that some places in the city are dangerous and there are streets that you should avoid. The best thing about touring with Cultura Cercana is peace of mind. You are being taken around in a private car with a private tour guide... You don't have to worry about walking through a neighborhood or walking down a street that may be dangerous for stick-out-like-a-sour-thumb tourists. You are being taken around in a private car with a private Argentine tour guide. If there is one thing that I do recommend you doing while spending your time in Buenos Aires, it is to take a tour through Cultura Cercana, I swear you will not regret it.P.S. seriously, what are you waiting for?? Book a tour!!!"

The city tour provided an excellent orientation on our arrival in Buenos Aires. Luciano (the owner) is a mine of cultural and historic facts, and was able to customize our tour to meet our interests. He was professional, on time and responsive. Andreas provided wonderful insights into life in the Tigre Delta and was a very hospitable host. He brought a partner with him who spoke impeccable English (his usual partner was unavailable, but Veronica was fabulous), and we learned much from them about Argentinian culture and history. Andreas cooked a delicious three course lunch for us (accommodating to our dietary restrictions) and the tango demo was the cherry on top. Highly recommend this company!"

We arrived a day early so we could see a little more of the city. We had read about Cultura Cercana from your website and booked with them for two tours. The first was with Andreas. We spent a whole day with him as he took us on his motor boat thru the beautiful Tigre Delta and to his family home on one of the many channels. He was charming to be with and told us much about his family, his culture and the city itself. When we arrived as his house, he prepared a beautiful lunch for us with wine, ravioli, appetizers, and a beautiful dessert. The Finale was that he and his friend are tango dance instructors, so they danced for us and then gave us a dance lesson! (sort of a disaster but fun!) It was a beautiful, relaxing day, and I still can't believe we had Andreas all to ourselves. We truly felt like natives! The best part was that after the long day, Andreas took us to the ship only to find that there was a strike and trucks were blocking the port. He performed heroically to get us to the ship and Luciano, the owner of Cultura Cercana, who was bringing our luggage separately, almost got arrested trying to get through the police blocade. I don't know of too many tour companies that would have taken on that extra responsibility. We were very grateful. The next day, we toured the city with Fabian, who couldn't have been more knowlegeable. We got to see alot because it was a Sunday, and there was no traffic and he told us so much about the cities history past and present. The cost of the tours were VERY resonable, half of what the cruise line charged, and those tours were shorter and with 30 or 40 people. We highly recommend these tours!!!"

The empanadas were ok! I didn't feel like people go to la boca to eat empanadas, but oh we'll, he worked it into our tour and saved us time. He showed us some of the highlights and what to see from the car. We drove through San telmo, puerto moderno, the city center and then finally we went to the recolet cemetary. He told us to ignore the conman at the front who was pretending to charge an entrance( I don't know why they allow him there) his tour of recoleta was nice since we got some explanations and some history.

We got through SO MANY of our \"want to see in Buenos Aires\" checklist from Trip Advisor, Lonely Planet and the Wallpaper Guide (thoroughly recommend the Wallpaper guide by the way) in just one day. The logistics of having someone, with a car who knows their way around saved so much time and meant so many more sights to see. Items like the Cemetery in Ricoletta were hugely more valuable when coupled with a highly knowledgable guide and having the history explained for various important people and the significance of their crypts.The ONLY downside to the entire day was the lunch. We had asked for something authentic and Argentine and our guide had really talked up this place the locals ate at. It would have to have been the absolutely worst steak we have EVER eaten!!! There was possibly a kickback involved (I can't see another reason on God's green earth why anyone would eat there) but I would thoroughly recommend you chose a couple of good restaurants / eateries from the wallpaper guide or trip advisor and request to have lunch there rather than let the guide advise you on dining selections. It is a good tour and a great way to get a broad view of many facets in Buenos Aires. With a decent place to have lunch (you pay for your lunch by the way - it is not included in the 8hr tour) this would easily be a four star rating for the tour!"

We enjoyed them very much and were very pleased with the tour guides. Highly recommended if you would like 1) To have someone treat you like a friend, showing you around the town2) Explore BA more in depth and with some local, unique and non-tourist experiences3) FlexibilityFull Story (For those who like to know more details)We arrived at the EZE early in the morning and opted to have Cultura Cercana picked us up from the airport (additional fee). We found our BA City Tour guide (Pablo) without any problem/stress.Before I continue, I must admit that I was a little worried because most of the review on TripAdvisor were referring to Luciano. Not much was about the other tour guides. But the rest of the day proved to me that Pablo was able to met any expectations that I had and even exceed them.Okay, back to the tour. We were led to all the key attractions in BA, along with in depth narratives by Pablo covering both cultural and historical prospective. On top of that, we stopped by a local market and were able to spend 20-30mins inside. Lunch was at a local cafe inside a non-tourist neighborhood. With Pablo's help on the menu (since we don't know Spanish), we enjoyed our first ever Argentinian steak. Delicious. We spent a good portion of the afternoon at Recoleta. I am sure that without Pablo, we would have got lost in there and wouldn't be able to appreciate the rich histories behind those graves (and which one belongs to whom).On the next day, we had Andres & Milta showing us Tigre (almost everything was close due to Jan 1) and Andrea's cottage in the Delta. The boat ride was pleasant and we spotted the \"Supermarket\" boat, \"Ravioli\" boat and the \"Ice-cream boat\". Milta led us to a short hike (~1hr) while Andres prepared our home made lunch. We had lunch in his gazebo, menu included Andrea's home-made sausages, Ravioli (from the boat) with home-made pasta sauce and dessert (Flan cake with Dulce de Leche)After lunch, we head out to the backyard, see some of his horses and then back to the gazebo for a quick Tango demo and lesson before heading back out to BA for a Tango Show (a separated booking through Cultura Cercana) in the evening.This was one of the most enjoyable day we had in our South America trip. (We boarded a cruise ship sailing around the Cape Horn next day)Thanks Pablo, Andres and Milta (Cultura Cercana) for a wonderful experience."

I knew that I wanted a guided tour to really understand the city, it's culture, and it's heritage. I asked around and kept getting some recommendations to do an open-bus type tour. I'm from the NYC area and see these things all the time in Manhattan and I cringe at the idea of being herded around like cattle in this manner. Not to say that this type of 'open-bus' experience isn't good for anyone it's just that it's more of a 'Disney' experience than a truly immersive view of a place and a people.So to TripAdvisor I went and then gave Luciano at Cultura Cercana a call. Prompt response and easy reservation. We were met at our apartment at the scheduled time and off we went. He asked what we were looking for in our City Tour and after giving him our interests and backgrounds he immediately crafted a full day tour.I will say that it was extremely well done and crafted. He hit all notes I was looking for. And I will be honest in saying that I did have a fair amount of interests that I wanted to explore. We undoubtedly visited many great places during our tour; essentially everywhere you would want to hit on a stop through Buenos Aires. But for me what set this experience above the rest was the insight provided by our guide. When I travel I want to know what it's really like there. Not just what the National Tourism Authority has decided are the key selling points for the destination. Picking our tour guide's brain about the cultural history and the historic and present day economic/political landscapes was very enlightening. Getting a local perspective on why people may act or do things the way they do in a country is invaluable to anyone that is seriously interested in deeply understanding a place and a people.Luciano is providing a fresh take on tourism in Buenos Aires and in South America. Do yourself a favor and take a tour with Cultura Cercana. Get more out of your travels, gain invaluable perspectives and bring them back home with you. They will only serve to enrich your life and those of the people around you.Cheers,CF"

We had Pablo as our guide and as some of the previous reviews have mentioned, it was like having a friend showing you the city. Pablo is passionate about his work and we had a fun day touring around the city with him. For lunch, he took us to a nice restaurant called the Cafe Margot at Boedo, which is a working class neighborhood, and we had a taste of the authentic Argentine steak sandwich. If you are looking for private tour in Buenos Aires, we highly recommend Cultura Cercana."

We had a half-day tour with Luciano and Pablo, and although it rained most of the time, we had a very enjoyable time touring the different areas of the city - which we definitely would not have covered without a local guide. Pablo is extremely knowledgeable and gives out enough facts and information without 'overloading' you. His knowledge around the Recoleto Cemetery was phenomenal and it drew together the history of Buenos Aires/Argentina in an entertaining way. He was also kind enough to email us twice with suggestions as to vegetarian restaurants, food and wine to try and Mate!, and also details of other places to visit - including the El Ateneo Splendid bookstore (was originally a theatre) - an absolute must not only for book browsers but also well worth a visit just to see and take photos (and there is a cafe on the former stage) - as Pablo said 'awesome'! Both Luciano and Pablo are very friendly and helpful young men who go out of their way to make their city an enjoyable experience, and we would recommend highly Cultura Cercana as tour guides in Buenos Aires."

Aside from being extremely knowledgeable about local politics, economics and history, CC's guides are highly accessible and absolutely charming.We ended up going on three tours on three separate days, beginning with a look at the Tigre delta, followed by a general tour of Buenos Aires, and finally a visit to Colonia del Sacramento in Uruguay. Each of these excursions was a highly personal and personalized experience. On our first full day in Argentina we explored the Tigre riverfront and the tour proved to be an excellent, relaxing way to acclimatize following a 14 hour flight from Los Angeles. It included a drive to the outskirts of BA, a boat ride on the lower reaches of the Parana and then a walking tour of one of the islands. Afterwards Andres took us into his home for a delicious home cooked meal. He and Mirta followed up with a very satisfying tango lesson, specifically targeted to those of us who were not known for our dancing ability. The next day we embarked on the day tour of BA lead by Luciano and Francisco, an introduction to cultural landmarks, hip, arty neighborhoods and historical events. This was an excellent general orientation and well worth our time and investment. At this juncture I should mention that my husband and I were travelling with three other couples, a disparate and difficult group of eight. We were probably the most difficult group they had ever encountered, although they were too polite to say so. Some of us were very interested in touring and learning about the region while others only wanted to eat, drink wine and shop; one of us developed a gum infection and required emergency dental surgery. Luciano and Francisco handled this spontaneously and seamlessly; they split up, parked some of us in bars, escorted others to shops and dental offices, then lead the rest of us through the sights and sounds of BA.On day three, Bruno met us at the port in Colonia. He brought Maria, his pareja, and an extra golf cart to accommodate our unwieldy group. Once again, half of us peeled off in the direction of the nearest bar. Bruno handled these defections with great aplomb, even making sure that our friends landed in a restaurant that served lunch at 11:00 A.M. Luciano has assembled an impressive staff of tour guides who know their regions intimately and are thoughtful, clever and kind. The experience was unlike any tour I have ever taken anywhere before. We give Cultura Cercana the highest recommendation."

My daughter and I are spending the holidays in Buenos Aires and we're so glad we took the 4-hour tour through Cultura Cercana on Christmas Eve. I know so much more about the city/country as a result of the morning, which was structured around places that I'd not been to yet. Pablo was a most engaging tour guide--his kindness, wealth of knowledge about and interest in Buenos Aires, and authenticity made the morning pass quickly. When we saw him at a drumming event a few days later, it was like meeting up with an old friend. I can't recommend Cultura Cercana highly enough. As dozens of others have shared, this is a first-class company."

There is simply no better way to see a city than someone explaining it to you.We had Francisco serve as our tour guide. He was only 24 but based on how much he knew, I would have assumed he was over 50 and had been doing this for 30 years. He is pursuing a graduate degree in sociology, so is very knowledgeable about Buenos Aires both historically and socially.We hit the major sights of the city (La Boca, Pink House, La Recoleta) and ate what turned out to be the best meal of our trip (it was a diner on river near the airport - of course, I forgot the name). Francisco was very informative and allowed us to go at our own pace. He was also a lot of fun. This is one of the best tours I have taken and I would estimate I have taken over 50 tours in the past 5 years. I highly recommend using this company for a tour of Buenos Aires."

However, you should search his website for his other offerings as well. He arranged a trip to the Tigre Delta for us with Andres, and this turned out to be one of the highlights of our cruise to South America. You will visit Andres' home in the Delta, which can only be reached by motor boat, be treated to snacks and later have a great lunch, take a nice walk by the river, and even have a chance to take a Tango lesson from a great instructor. And did I mention the lunch? My wife, a food critic, pronounced the flan the best she has ever eaten."

We had done a walking tour the day before, so they revamped their plan and took us to places we had not seen such as La Boc and Palermo. We also got to go through the Presidential Palace that was only open one day a week. We had a grand time with them and learned even more than we laughed (which was quite a bit!).............can't say enough good about Luciano and his company. Andrea organized everything beautifully; she graciously and promptly answered countless emails with fairly dumb questions from me ahead of time and made us dinner reservations and arranged transportation for the tango show. My camera battery died, so Pablo loaned me his and then emailed the pictures (LOTS of them) to me. They also provided fabulous guides for us in Montevideo (Bruno) and in Ushuaia (Gaston). I highly recommend all of them."

To have this when arriving in a new city was a great comfort. Luciano is extremely welcoming and from the time we got into his car he started telling us all about Buenos Aires and Argentina. We had a milion questions - his patience is long lasting.We were brought to La Boca, Recoleta, Puerto Madero, Placa Mayo and many other parts. It was also a rolling tour as he would tell us about the buildings we were passing. And this was all within a four hour tour. He also gave us great recommendations for restaurants, pubs and coffee shops.

We did more in depth visits at La Boca and the Recoleta Cemetery with him during our tour, and it was great way to learn insider and detailed information about two of the major tourist sights.

He took our answers to heart and took us places we would never have found on our own. I feel we saw the Buenos Aires which most interested us. Luciano is definitely worth the price you pay for a private guide. He uses a combination of his private car and walking tours in specific places as he gives you a good insight into the history of Buenos Aires. He also sent us specific directions for finding restaurants near our hotel--like \"turn right out of the door of your hotel, turn on ... street, etc.\" so that all we had to do was follow his directions. And all his suggestions were great. Don't hesitate--use Cultura Cercana Tours."

The tour guide Luciano was extremely well educated and well versed in everything about Argentina from Politics to history to culture to geography, there was no question that went unanswered. Since he picked up and dropped off personally there is no worrying about getting somewhere on time or paying a taxi. The tour itself is very personalized, he made suggestions and so did we and he personalized the tour more and more as he got to know the personalities of the people present. We went to the areas well known for its tourism and areas more local that he suggested. He also recommended theatres to go to at night, restaurants and bars in aour area that were popular. I highly recommend doing the tour early on in the trip since he gives so many suggestions of other tours and things to do. We had the tour in spanish but he is also fluent in english. Midway thru the tour i felt like i was talking and touring with a good friend from college!! I highly recommend doing the 8 hour option since time flies on the tour. There is the option of 4 hours which we extended to 6 hours and we easily could have gone longer!!

There seemed to be nothing that he didn't know about his city & he gave us many tips on places to look at during the rest of the vacation.We also booked a trip to the Tigre delta & this was a wonderful day out with Andres . We really got a feel for life in the delta as well as enjoying a great boat ride, wonderful food & conversation & a tango lesson from his friend.Our final trip was to an Estancia about 60km from BA. We spent the day with a working farmer/polo player & were able to learn a lot about the gauchos and life out on a ranch. There were horse rides, good food & great conversations.Every one of these trips was a delight & I would highly recommend Luciano for someone looking for a real taste of life in Argentina rather than the usual mass tourist tour.I would also like to point out that(due to external circumstances) when a problem occurred with a proposed(travel agent) trip, Luciano went out of his way to keep us up to date as to what was happening with regard to refunds and was able, through his mastery of law, to ensure that we recouped all of our money. He continued to work on this after we had returned home & did not give up until he reached a successful conclusion."

Luciano's depth of knowledge and passion about Argentina and Buenos Aires was evident as he gave me a fascinating day tour. I understand so much more about the history, people and places than I could have gained any other way. We visited such a very wide and interesting range of attractions including the key palaces and buildings, the extraordinary cathedral, the artists at San Palermo, the Art Gallery, the old and new docks, the incredible cemetary where influential Argentinians have their mausoleums, the best steak restaurant, and so much else. Luciano listened to my interests and made sure that they were met. He is an engaging, articulate and seemingly tireless guide with fluent English. It was truly a day to remember and I recommend his personalized tours very highly."

We have been on scores of the standard city tours in many countries and can say, without a doubt, that this is NOT one of those standard / average tours. Luciano tailored the day to be what we wanted - and the mix of architecture, politics, history & culture was exactly what we were seeking. Luciano has an easy going style and was a gracious host. It was a nice mix of walking and car touring - so even for our 50+ yr old bodies we covered a lot of the city and were not totally wiped out. We really enjoyed the ability to ask questions and go into many different topics with Luciano. He knows the info and is not confined to the 'script' of so many other tour guides. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this tour!"

We could not have asked for a better guide. He is intelligent, well-educated and well-spoken, and provides a nuanced, \"big picture\" overview of Buenos Aires and Argentina in a short period of time. His love of his city and country is evident and we thoroughly enjoyed our time with him.He was prompt to pick us up on our first day and completely planned the day around what we wanted to see. The day was well planned and not too strenuous, with a nice lunch at one of his family's favorite restaurants. At the end of the day, he even took us shopping for purses at his mother's favorite stores.Our flight home after the cruise was not until late so it was a relief to know that Luciano would be picking us up and, really, taking care of us all day before our flight. How he managed to fit all our luggage into his car, I'll never know, but it all went in. We spent a lovely day seeing the rest of the city. Luciano went above and beyond, even cruising up and down the streets of Palermo Soho searching for a particular street vendor whose jewelry my mother had admired at the beginning of our trip.Truly an outstanding experience. I would definitely recommend Cultura Cercana to anyone and look forward to returning to BsAs with my husband so that we can do the tango tour."

When Luciano picked us up from our hotel, we were instantly at ease with him. He was very knowledgeable and spoke English very well. He drove us to a dance studio in one of the outer barrios which also gave us a chance to see a bit more of the city. At the studio we met with two very nice and very talented dance teachers. We had a private Tango lesson which gave us a very good foundation for continuing with the dance. Then, we all went to a nearby neighborhood \"milonga\", where people of all ages danced Tango well into the night. It was great to have an experience of the people of the city just enjoying the dance they love rather than seeing more of a commercialized show. I might add that while we were there we also snacked on the best empanadas we had while in Buenos Aires. Luciano provided for us a great experience of the Tango and we definitely recommend it."

My cousin and I were visiting from Sydney, Australia and although we had a few days in Buenos Aires, we honestly couldn't have learned as much as we did without the seemingly-endless knowledge of our guide. Whether you want to take heaps of photos or learn about the historical depth of the city, Luciano tailors the tour to what you want\u2014even if all you want is a big, fat juicy Argentinian steak. We had a lot of fun riding around the city in a comfortable, air-conditioned car \u2014 even listening to Reggaetone on request. The best part about Luciano is that he always tries his best to answer any question you may have, and goes beyond his duties of the day by suggesting places that you might want to see, or restaurants that you might want to eat if you ask! The day after the tour we went to a great restaurant in Palermo (upon Luciano's suggestion), where the lamb and pumpkin mash was simply divine. Some of the most memorable meals in Buenos Aires can be attributed to him!All in all, he will take you to see the sites \u2014 touristy, non-touristy, anything you really want to see and he will do it with a smile! He is a wealth of knowledge, and opened our eyes to many things that we never would have discovered about Buenos Aires on our own. I would definitely recommend Luciano to anyone looking to explore the in style!"

There wasn't any topic he couldn't cover; history, futbol (soccer), architecture, polo, economics and politics were just a sampling of what we discussed.On the Tigre tour, Luciano also picked us up and drove us north where our guide, Andres, picked us up in his private boat and gave us a water-view tour of the delta before arriving at his farm and retreat. We met his animals and sat down to a lovely, fresh breakfast. After a nice walk in the woods to get a feel for the area, we returned for some swimming, more boating and a beautiful homemade lunch.These are just two of the many tours that Cultura Circana has to offer.

We boated, swam, ate, boated some more, and just overall really enjoyed a great day in this unique area of Argentina. A short drive from the city, but a world away. It is easy to see why this has been a popular refuge for city-dwellers for decades.Without these tours our visit to Argentina would have given us only the broadest overview, now I feel we have really BEEN there."

I tend to be a bit compulsive of what I want to see and do, but after a few minutes with him...I relaxed and let him take control. He is flexible so that we were able to make changes as we were touring.He will design the tour based on your desires and does not dominate your tour...it is personally created. We were very interested in the political situation in Argentina, Luciano provided a historical as well as an accurate representation of both sides. He makes you feel a part of the past as well as the present time...and even the future of his beloved country. I was continually amazed at the depth of his knowledge in all areas.Prior to booking his services, I emailed him my ideas. He responded with his suggestions to amplify what I had expected to see and thanks to Skype I was able to meet him before we arrived. The company also has a Tango division where they take you to the very best (non-tourist) shows in town I think one of the best parts of being with Luciano (besides his knowledge) is his warmth and love of people. His sense of humor is so terrific that we had many laughs along the way. Oh yes, he has a new car that is airconditioned for the hot summer days.

We did something different on our 2nd day and took the Tigre/Parana delta tour. What a dream day it was for the 4 of us. After taking the short & easy 30 min drive from Buenos Aires to Tigre, we were promptly met by Andres our guide for the day. We then took a 30 min boat ride through the Delta to his beautiful streamside home. The beautiful scenery led to the perfect day. We had coffee and pastries - went on a hike through the island, interacted with his many horses. Sat on the dock relaxing, took a swim in the cool & clean river and had another boat ride later in the day to see the other areas of the Delta, including the large Parana river.We are only sorry that we did not partake in the available Tango lessons, which would have been wonderful. I would recommend this tour to anyone looking to enjoy the Tigre area and enjoy a leisurely day full of fun and time spent enjoying the area like a local. Far more interesting than the normal touristic tours offered at the main docks in Tigre.A beautiful lunch was prepared of homemade pasta and sauce with a tasty flan dessert. Beer, water & soda are all provided throughout the day.Thanks again to Luciano & Cultura Cercana for planning yet another picture perfect day in Argentina for us & our friends!"

Luciano is a degreed lawyer who discovered he didn't enjoy the profession as much as he enjoyed studying it. But he loves his country and his city--and that shows during his tour. Just to give you a comparison: the on-off bus costs 70 pesos per person. When they're on schedule, they run every half hour. And if they're full, you just have to wait for the next one. The full tour runs about 2 1/2 hours.Today, we had a 4 1/2 tour with Luciano, geared to our interests and avoiding areas already covered in the two free walking tours posted elsewhere on this board, for 120 pesos each. And Luciano knows so much about the history and culture of his country and his city.We give Cultura Cercana 10 points out of 10! Do the two free walking tours and this.

He took us all over town and into the outskirts of the city to places we would have never discovered on our own. His english is great, he has a law degree but discovered he prefered showing out-of-towners his wonderful city over practicing law, so started his personal tour business. A good choice if you ask me. We could not have had a more enjoyable day, he was curtious, knowledgable, articulate, and very informative. When we were done for the day he recommend several things for us do do off of the beaten path, gave us names of restaruants to try, and suggested Milangas that we should go to.

He spoke English which helped me but it was his passion, knowledge and not limiting us to any questions we had. He took us to various parts of the city i had not read in my tour reviews. We even had lunch at a local place that was far removed from the tourists that we loved! In essence, our bucket list wish was rewarded with a great trip but if it was not for Luciano who capped it with a special day, Buenos Aires would not have been as Beautiful as expected. We want to go back for two weeks next time and of course, look up our now friend, Luciano....the best tour guide of the Paris of South America!"

            "review": "The city tour with Luciano was like seeing Buenos Aires with a good friend.. We booked a city tour on-line with Luciano for our first day in Buenos Aires. Speaking next to no Spanish we thought it would be a good idea to book a private tour. Luciano responded instantly and made me feel comfortable with my choice. He met us at our apartment and charmed us immediately. He was so knowlegable about the city's history, and we enjoyed a spirited discussion of American and Argentine politics, as well. We told him we were interested in seeing the countryside, but not really keen on one of the more touristy gaucho tours. He hooked us up with Juan, from Casco Viejo, who owns an estancia in Canuelas, about one hour outside of BA. Juan picked us up and drove us to his farm, gave us the grand tour on horseback and cooked us a wonderful asado, which we ate amid the fruit trees on the lawn in front of the estate house. After lunch we had another ride before we headed back to the city. It was a wonderful, relaxing day.But we weren't done with Luciano yet. When our friends from Brazil joined us for a few days, we booked Cultura Cercana's \"Feeling Tango\" tour. With professional dancers Paula and Rodriguez we attended a milonga. They explained all the intricacies of the tango, and we watched them dance with the other couples. It really felt like an inside look at the tango culture.Throughout our 10 days in BA, Luciano kept in touch, giving us recommendations about places to eat and things to do, and helping us get airport information we needed, etc. We really felt like we had been shown around the city by a good friend."

When we arrived in Buenos Aires, Luciano came to our hotel to discuss potential tour options and we immediately felt comfortable with booking a tour through him. He planned an unconventional tour based on our request and took us to Tigre and the delta for the day. After seeing a small artisan craft market we took a boat tour to a friend's house where we had a nice hike and an awesome homecooked meal. Afterward we took the boat back to explore the rest of the historical parts of town and arrived back at our apartment safe and sound. I would recommend Luciano to anyone going to Buenos Aires and wants to take an unique and fun tour!"

We booked a tour through Luciano at Cultura Cercana that included the tango lesson beforehand, after reading about it on the trip advisor website. The tour was just our personal group of my 4 adult children and I although we all had 2 left feet, our wonderful instructors Paula and Rodrigo took us through the steps with lots of fun and laughter. We then set off for the Milonga where we had great empanadas and drinks. Luciano explained the local customs and gave us lots of information on Buones Aires and its people. We were very nervous about dancing the tango, as everyone on the dancefloor was so good, but Paula and Rodrigo calmed our nerves and took us through the dances and it was great fun! We were then delivered back to our hotel and Luciano even emailed us through suggestions for other things to do in Buones Aires and great places to shop. We had a wonderful experience and would recommend Cultura Cercana to anyone contemplating a truely memorable experience for the \"real\" Buones Aires"

We did not want to see the typical tango show (broadway style) instead we went on a private tour to see where the Argentineans themselves danced. It was an incredible night, we drank local red wine with empanadas, watch the local dance the tango and venture through a few clumsy steps of our own with the help of our guide. We felt very welcomed and enjoyed it very much. Bring comfortable shoes! Take a small camera. Ask to be picked up and returned to your hotel with their private car. We enjoyed so much Luciano's company that we booked a city tour for the next afternoon with him too. He is a very well educated young men, charismatic and fluent in english. Buenos Aires has so many old, beautiful buildings and monuments that is so contrasting to what we see here in the USA. In the city tour you make a lot of stops so take comfortable clothing and walking shoes, camera and a bottle water. For a great snack tell him to take eat a sandwich the lomito (filet mignon) in la costanera. My mouth is watering as I remember the best steak I have ever eaten."

            "review": "The perfect (& perfectly priced) private tour of Buenos Aires!. I had the pleasure of taking a 1/2 day city tour of Buenos Aires with Cultura Cercana tour guide and owner Luciano this past February. There were 4 people in my group and we had the best day with Luciano guiding us every step of the way. A few really great things about the tour:1) It is 100% private. There is no bus full of strangers or waiting for the group to catch up/slow down.2) The Cultura Cercana tour guides are locals and know everything there is to know about Buenos Aires. There was not a single question we asked, from food, to government, to night-life that Luciano couldn't answer.3) The pricing for the tours are PER TOUR rather than per person - a really great deal.4) It's customizable. I live in Argentina and already planned to see some areas with my visiting friends on my own. I let Luciano know the areas we would like to see and he tailored the tour to our needs. We even let him know where we planned on having lunch and he set up the tour schedule so we ended up in that area at the end of the tour. (He even made the lunch reservation for us!)Luciano (who speaks perfect English) arrived at our hotel right on time with his car ready to start the day. We drove to several areas throughout the tour and would then park and take a walk around to see additional sights in each of the areas. We had the best time touring with a local who could really provide insight into the Argentine culture and sights.Since that tour - I have recommended the Tango Tour offered by the company to another group of American visitors and have received nothing by rave reviews for how much fun it was. It's next on my list.If you want to see the real Buenos Aires with a knowledgeable, fun and safe tour company - then Cultura Cercana is for you!"

I was definitely looking to see a Tango show during my first visit to Buenos Aires, but when I read the description on the website it was so much different than all the other tours I had seen. And, the experience truly was unique and one of my favorite memories from the trip. Cultura Cercana takes you behind the scenes of the real life of the Tango, not the pre-planned shows that run night after night filled with other tourists. Instead, you get a real view into the Tango that people participate in night after night \u2013 this is not a choreographed show, but just as amazing. We learned so much more about the culture of the people and the dance, and \u2013 we had the best empanadas of our entire trip. The best part was that we were the only tourists in the place, it truly was a rare glimpse into the culture, the people and the Tango, and coming with Luciano and our teachers we felt at home. I would recommend Luciana and Cultura Cercana to anyone who is looking for an authentic experience in Buenos Aires. Although we only booked the Tango tour, Luciano showed us a bit of the city on the way back to our hotel and had such a different understanding and insight about some of the buildings and stories than we had experience on our private tour of the city arranged by the hotel the day before. I wish we had used him instead!"

Plus we stopped at a nice restaurant for lunch. At the end of the day, we were dropped off at our hotel. Everyone was courteous and friendly. I would recommend them!"

She was extremely knowledgeable, patiently answered all of our questions, and showed us all of the wonderful sights of the city. We spent a most enjoyable day together. Also, Elisabeth (the tour company owner) was spectacularly efficient -- quickly answering emails and ensuring that everything went smoothly. I highly recommend TPS if you are considering a private tour. You won't be disappointed."

I normally don't write a review while am still,traveling, but I just can't wait to express my appreciation and affection for the wonderful tour guide we had in Buenos Aires, Elisabet Jeckel. My husband and I were fortunate to be able to spend 3 days in her delightful company, benefiting not only from her professionalism and vast knowledge of all things Buenos Aires, but her good humor and willingness to go the extra mile to guarantee that we had the perfect experience, in the process creating beautiful memories that will stay with us forever. Day 1 she took us on her city tour which included places in the city that were a bit off the beaten path, as well as the major sights one expects to see. Day 2, we went to San Isidre and Tigre, suburbs which are north of the city, and we took a boat tour of the Tigre Delta. This was fun and it was interesting to see how life happens outside of the city - it didn't hurt that the weather was spectacular! On our 3rd day with Elisabet, she took us to an Estancia in the Pampas and for me, this was the highlight - it was so beautiful, peaceful and the way the gaucho interacted with his horse, it was magical. Whatever you do, don't miss the opportunity to do this - and do it with Elisabet! I knew Elisabet was going to be great even before I met her because of her clear and timely communication with me via email throughout the months before our trip. She made arrangements for us to go to a private wine tasting/pairing that was very good and informative and if you have any interest in wine, I suggest you have her book this for you. I encourage you to go to her website to read more details about her tours and what she offers, but trust me, if you decide to use Elisabet as your personal guide while you are in Buenos Aires, you will not be disappointed. As a matter of fact, you will probably want to thank me, so I 'll just end this review by saying \"you're very welcome!\" PS - I would be remiss not to mention Carlos, Elisabet's wonderful driver. He didn't speak English but communicated with his smile and cheerful disposition. Carlos truly is a gem and his presence only added to the fun."

We were so impressed by her knowledge and friendly manner we arranged to meet up with Elisabet again when we visited in November 2015. It was just like meeting up with an good friend. Elisabet arranged a special \"tasting\" tour of Buenos Aires in November as we had visited the many city sights last year. She also included some interesting city sights and provided very interesting commentary on places we were visiting. For lunch we went to a very small local steak house called \"La Carniceria\". What a unique and satisfying experience. Later that afternoon Elisabet had arranged for us to have a wine tasting and pairing experience at Anuva Wines. Elisabet takes care of everything and is a pleasure to be with. Her driver is also very courteous and helpful. Elisabet is a must if you are wanting to experience the real Buenos Aires. We are happy to call her a friend, as well as a very professional tour guide."

I lucked out and she was able to make a couple of holes in her schedule to escort us with car and driver.First , we were grounded for 6 hours in Cordoba because BA airport was shut down due to rains.I was unable to telephone her( I did not have the correct country code in my phone), so i emailed my daughter in Pennsylvania who contacted her about the delay. Apparently she was very reassuring to my daughter who reported back that I would be in good hands. Sure enough, Elizabet had waited with the car and driver she had arranged for our pickup, and accepted no additional compensation for her time. With the crazy hoardes of delayed passengers in the airport this was truly a lifesaving service.She customized our itineraries \"on the fly\" once she realized I had been there before, but my husband had not, and since we had all day itineraries with her, but not consequetively, she gave us good sugggestions of where to go and what would be possible in my hampered state, on the days that we were on our own. Her love for her country was apparent in the pride she displayed in showing us around and giving us the background history. I appreciated that Much of what she explained was local knowledge and not just canned information from a guide book. The cars and drivers she provided were all efficient and courteous. What more can I say, she saved the day! I have no hesitation recommending her and apologise for this late review."

Elisabet is truly remarkable and made us feel like we were seeing the City with an old friend. The nice thing about her tours is that you can tell her what you want to do and see and she not only makes it happen but makes it happen flawlessly. We did an 8-hour city tour, a 3-hour shopping tour, and a 3-hour cathedral/Casa Rosada/San Telmo Market tour. She was so lovely with my mother and made sure that the pace was always perfect. When we wanted theater tickets before we left the U.S. all I had to do was e-mail Elisabet and she had front-row seats waiting for us when we arrived. She truly takes care of anything you could need even before you arrive -- that is first class service. When I mentioned my mother wanted to see some of the sights related to Pope Francis -- Elisabet made it happen.Her knowledge of the City and the sights is remarkable (as is her English). We could not have asked for a better guide here in Buenos Aires. If you are coming to the City I cannot recommend Elisabet enough."

Elisabet knows so much about the area, is accommodating and will help you plan a tour around all your favourite things. She knows the history, great stories, knows the best shopping spots and all the little hidden gems that you don't find in tour books! Her english is perfect and she knows where to get the best empanadas! I thoroughly enjoyed this tour and would come back again in the future to tour around the other amazing spots in Bunoes Aires with Elisabet!"

The day before our tour, we had the opportunity to shop, dine and attend a tango thanks to these tips. The tour itself was very well planned and quite professional. She had given thought to many of the smallest details which makes the difference between good and great. On our next visit, we will definitely book a tour with her. Another plus, we had a personal driver along with Elisabet as our guide."

Elisabet was our tour guide...she was most accommodating, arranging a pickup of our group at the Cruise terminal and taking us on an 8 hour tour of beautiful Buenos Aires. She took us to many attractions, afforded us a detailed history of the city, took us to a lovely non-tourist local restaurant with Argentinian menu for lunch, dropped us off at our hotel and even arranged a delightful Tango Show and Dinner for us that evening. Then she arranged the next day a shuttle for us from the hotel to the airport. She is indeed the best!!"

I (64) and my daughter (24) have just returned to the UK having spent three days in Buenos Aires, two days with Elisabet and her driver Daniel.They made certain that our trip was truly excellent; a full day touring BA - I think we really did see all the key places with an enthusiastic, intelligent and uninterested individual who soon seemed like a friend. The pace was relaxed, there was time to spend longer where we wanted more time - all in all it was great.We next went a couple of hours out of the city to an Estancia, horse riding, (or pony and trap) old singing gaucho who was charming, young handsome gauchos if that's your thing. Great food, variety, quality and taste.Elisabeth helped choose and book restaurants, a Tango Show and a tutored wine tasting.I've had guide services on tens of occasions around the world - this was truly excellent.Thank you."

I asked her to give us a tour through her eyes and include some interesting places that may not be part of a regular bus tour. She did just that. Our day with her was just great. Her English is excellent , her knowledge of the city and country is extensive. I would highly recommend both her and any recommendations she gives you whetherIt's about where to see the tango or were to go shopping. I would also mention that she uses an excellent driver. The traffic in this city is exceptionally challenging, and thought he did a great job."

She researched our interests and then gave us three full days of incredible tours - an all-day gaucho experience, a trip to El Tigre and the Delta and a customized tour around areas of Buenos Aires we had not seen before. Elsebet was a wealth of knowledge about locations, architecture, and culture. My husband and I had wonderful discussions with her and felt like she was a family member taking us around \"her\" town. She also had an excellent and a safe driver so she could provide share information about sights as we traveled. I highly recommend taking tours with her. You will learn so much, take way to many photos, have a great time and wish you had more days to travel with her. We will definitely book her again when we go back to BA."

To Whom It May Concern: Elisabet, the bright, effervescent sun in the Buenos Aires flag showed me the cultural riches of this boundless, yet boundaried city. As soon as I contracted with her, she sent me nice, quick emails every couple of weeks as an introduction. They were valuable to a busy teacher such as myself. My plan was to slip a trip to the Southern Hemisphere during Thanksgiving break. I didn't want to lose a minute! Considering my wide range of interests (dance,education,art, geography), Elisabet had a difficult task ahead of her. She patiently and joyously considered each and every interest as she artfully danced us about the metropolis with Daniel at the helm. We saw: European Master works of art; the essence of Eva Peron in at least three places; the birthplace of Tango; the Rio de la Plata; the Casa Dorada; we rode on the widest road in South America; tried local fare for lunch; and more! Since she is a proud local, Elisabet knows all the hot spots, nooks and crannies, basilicas, cemeteries, country clubs, tea rooms, and just about anything you'd want to find in this exciting mixture that is Buenos Aires. Elisabet will take you on a journey that you won't forget! Don't plan your trip to Argentina without talking to her first."

It boils down to a trip to a historic town in the pampas, then several hours at a working ranch (estancia). It was excellent.Picked up dead on time from Puerto Madero by Caesar, who is a very pleasant man and offered many interesting anecdotes on the trip to San Antonio de Areco which took about two hours.The host Guillermo is delightful, energetic and a great ambassador for gaucho culture. His tour of the town took about an hour and was fascinating. You will be a person with great strength of character to avoid buying something from the silversmith shop towards the end of the town visit.The Estancia Ombu de Areca is picture perfect, an old low lying colonial building with high ceilings surrounded by shade trees. We enjoyed a short horse ride, then had an excellent asado lunch before being treated to the musical stylings of one of the oldest and most famous gauchos and then a superb display of horsemanship.This trip is not cheap but is well worth it for anyone seeking to get out of BA for the day and wanting to learn about gaucho culture. Guillermo is a fantastic guide and clearly loves his job. This was the last thing we did on a 9 day trip to BA and it was probably the highlight. PS we organised to be dropped back at the airport and this went smoothly."

We were picked up right on time and ha d wonderful day. Laura was a fantastic and informative guide and as a local knows everything about the town and estancias. If I had my time over we may have tried to stay a night as the town is full of character and there's lots of great artisan shops to browse etc. it took 2 hrs from Palermo in the morning and 1.45 return so you really do need the whole day. It was a great way to appreciate some of the Pampas and Gaucho culture if you only have a short time and it was a. Eryn outrage experience rather than a big group so Inwould highly recommend this tour."

She's a wealth of knowledge about the history of the town and during the tour she reminded me of the favorite teachers I've had. The town itself is pretty and we saw a number of the silver shops and then stopped at a great chocolate stop. From there, we went on a tour of an estancia where we had the chance to do some very calm horseback riding, followed by a traditional barbecue lunch, and a horse whisperer show. The estancia is lovely and the hosts congenial and efficient. I can't say enough about the lovely personalities of both Laura and Jose Maria. Both of them are very warm and absolute professionals, happy to share their opinions and knowledge. Well worth it."

Our stay in Buenos Aires was limited and we knew we wanted to experience something outside of the city that is indicative of the culture and the area. We didn't want anything \"canned\" or super expensive. With such limited time we didn't want to rent a car and try to maneuver our way around. After reviewing a few of the reviews of Camino Pampa and other Estancias we settled on Camino Pampa. I reached out to Guillermo and I got an immediate response back with all of my questions answered. Our driver Jose (which was arranged by Guillermo) picked us up right on time. We picked up two other people (Mike and Mike) and off we went. It was a cloudy day with the occasional ran, but that didn't stop us. Our first stop was San Antonio de Areco where we met our guide, Juan Manuel Hernandez. He was amazing! We had family members who did not speak Spanish and his English was better than ours. Juan is a very interesting person in that he is well traveled, knows his countries history (and ours) probably better than most Americans. He is passionate about what he does and describes everything with enthusiasm that is most contagious. We walked around the town, church, silversmith, chocolate factory and then onto the Estancia. Here they greeted us with wine and delicious empanadas. Followed by the best Asado we had while in Buenos Aires. A Gaucho did a horsemanship demonstration that defies logic. I don't want to give it away, but I can't even train my dog to do what the horse did. Then we went on a horseback ride around the Estancia. I personally would have liked to have a longer ride but it did start to rain. Personally, this didn't bother more than it bothered my hair. I would highly recommend this tour. Honestly, when we go back to Buenos Aires, we will probably book this again. That is how much we enjoyed it."

I feared the day would be a \"bust.\" Instead, we experienced a remarkable day of history, architecture, food and horsemanship. Our guide, Juan Manuel, was incredibly knowledgeable, articulate and entertaining. He seemed to know and be known by everyone in the village of San Antonio de Areco, and kept us laughing the entire day. Riding horseback across the pampas was a \"bucket list\" experience. The mid-day meal was amazing -- such a variety of salads, meats and other dishes -- and ended with authentic songs by a working gaucho on the ranch. Many others have remarked on the magical horsemanship exhibited by the gauchos -- true horse whisperers! In conclusion, I can't say enough good about this trip. I recommend it without reservation to anyone wanting to see a bit of Argentina beyond the outskirts of Buenos Aires."

We arranged everything via email with Guillermo and was very smooth. We were 4 Argentine people and 3 Germans. The driver Cesar picked us up from our house on time and drove us to Areco. He was a nice and friendly person who gave us information on the way. We met in Areco with Juan Manuel, our guide for the day. He showed us the town, church, silver craftmen where we could meet the owner and received may information from him and his craft. We were not pushed to buy anything at all there. We then went to the Estancia were some of us went horse-riding and others on a carriage. It was great fun and everyone loved it. We had an amazing lunch with other guests (empanadas, asado, great meat, chicken, a variety of salads, good wine and ice cream). We had some nice traditional music from a Gaucho that works at the estancia. Everyone at the estancia was extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful. We saw as well a demonstration of gaucho's skills with horses. Juan Manuel was very informative, witty and friendly, and even though we hired the tour in English, he gave some info in Spanish too. He was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions. We all had a great day and it was a memorable one for our foreign friends. But we can say that this will be as enjoyable for locals as well as for foreigners too."

This was exactly the day out of the city that I had in mind. The driver and our tour guide Juan Manuel picked us up from our apartment promptly at 8:00am and we had entertaining commentary and discussions for the 2 hr drive (included picking up another couple at their hotel) to the town of San Antonio de Areco. In the town, we had a short walking tour and stopped at 3 silver craftsman (no pressure to buy) and the local chocolate shop. From the town, we did a short drive to the estancia at which we were warmly welcomed. The estancia is a beautiful setting, the lunch was excellent and we had a great experience. I would highly recommend this to those looking for a nice quite and relaxing day out of the big city."

We visited local artisans and we were never pushed to buy anything.The actual estancia was beautiful and relaxing. We went horseback riding in the pampas, a wonderful experience even for a beginner such as myself.

Our driver was on time for our pick up at the hotel and we picked up one other family in BA before heading out. We met our tour guide in the quaint town of San Antonio de Areco, and we walked around and learned about some of the history and visited local artisan shops. No one pushed us to buy anything. On the contrary, we got tours of the workshops where goods were handcrafted, and got to see some artisans in action. So it was more of a learning experience--very cool. One side note is that there are a lot of stray dogs in town and several tagged along on our tour. I like dogs and they were friendly, so it was no bother. But the other family had kids who were afraid of them so just be aware.Later, we headed to the estancia. It was beautiful and lovely--lots of trees, a beautiful villa, and of course, horses. You had a choice of either horseback riding, or riding a horse drawn carriage. We went horseback riding with a group we met up with onsite. The horses are trained to walk in a group, so as a beginner, I had no problems. There were several children who also rode on their own horse, and had no problems. The horseback ride was about an hour along the countryside. It made the trip entirely worth it! It was a relaxing ride, and all that fresh air, I couldn't stop smiling the whole time! After the horseback riding we ate. The meats were not great, but for me, the sides, made up for it. The Guachos gave us a short demonstration after we ate as well. Personally, my main reason for booking this tour is that I wanted to horseback ride. I got to do that, and the experience was wonderful. So for me, this was an excellent choice for a first time trip to Argentina. Some notes: Phone service is sketchy at the villa; Our tour guide did not ask us for payment. We had to bring it up at the end of the tour when we got dropped off at the hotel (Their way of being polite I guess). We also tipped our guide and driver, so be prepared for that too."

We were picked up by our driver from our hotel in Buenos Aires and driven to San Antonio de Areco where we met our guide. The guide was an ex teacher and spoke fluent English which was a great help. My partner and I are aged 60 plus and found the gentle pace of our tour around the town to just right (the guide was in our age bracket). Local spots of interest as well as the history of the area were explained and we were able to do some small amount of shopping. There was no pressure selling here either with the guide seeming to be completely unattached to any retail outlets, which again was a reassuring sign. We then met up with our driver and were taken out to the Estancia (ranch). This was a working ranch and although I was brought up on a farm in the UK I never in my life imagined that I would one day be riding through the Argentinian pampas! We had a delightful BBQ lunch with a bottle of good Argentinian wine and were taken back to our Hotel. Of all the trips we did on our visit to South America this was perhaps the best of them."

We were picked up in Buenos Aires at 8:30am and driven to meet our charming tour guide, Guillermo Gonzalez Guereno. We loved seeing San Antonio maintain their culture and traditions of art, silversmiths, chocolate shops (samples were fantastic!), leather workers, etc. The only thing that could have made the tour better was to get a coffee to go. :) After the tour, we were taken to the estancia for a welcome drink of our choice (beer or wine) and warm empanadas. We then went horseback riding (some took carriage ride instead) around the pampa. We were lucky to see many calves in the grasslands that had just been born. After we were shown the grilling process for their meats. We sat down to an abundant meal of salads, wine, and meats including various steaks, chicken, and ribs. A generous helping of thetraditional Christmas dessert of dulce de leche ice cream was divine. Our tour guide joined our table for lunch which we enjoyed to hear more about his life and culture. A guacho played his guitar and sang folk music for the group. after we watched the horse taming methods used. The tour included the ride back to the city. I highly recommend this tour and guide!"

Our private guide first took us to San Antonio de Areco, a charming town, where we enjoyed delicious chocolates. The estancia was magical and elegant. We enjoyed a horseback ride with the gauchos, a gourmet lunch on the deck, were sereneded by guitar by a gaucho and treated to a masterful display of an amazing relationship between horses and humans.

We were picked up from our hotel in BA and driven out to the estancia - I can't remember his name but our driver was very nice and spoke English well. We were then met in Areco by our guide for the day, Manuel who was amazing - very entertaining and great company. Manuel showed us around Areco before we drove out to the farm. Its a gorgeous little colonial town. Very quaint. Best chocolate biscuits I have ever tasted bought at the local chocolate shop! The farm was just as I had hoped- a gracious Argentinian country estate. Beautifully kept and run. It was very relaxing having a few wines, eating fabulous asado and chatting with Manuel in the estancia grounds. The horse riding was fun for the very basic riders that we are (saw lots of cows!). The goucho skills demonstation after our ride was incredible. Stunning actually. My daughter and I travelled for four months through South America and I must say this day was one of the highlights. If you are looking for a relaxing day and in a beautiful country atmosphere with gaucho charm, then I recemmond doing this day tour."

We were picked up in a lovely big and comfortable 9 person van by Senor Jose who drove us through the city explaining features we were seeing, and answered our questions on football, politics and the economy along the 1 1/2 hour trip to San Antonio de ARECO. There were only 4 of us on this tour so we had a very personal experience, both on the trip to San Antonio de ARECO and with Guillermo on our walking tour there. He showed us some lovely old gaucho bars and I'd love to be able to stay here on a weekend when music and dancing fills these bars, both with locals and visitors. We also visited some local tradesmen, a leatherwork per, silversmith and chocolatier, where we tasted the most delicious alfajores and chocolates which we bought for Easter later in the week. We then went out to the Estancia El OMBU de ARECO. We were greeted with a cold drink, wine, water, beer or soft drink and a delicious fresh empanada. We opted for the carriage ride around the estancia rather than the horse ride, but the two ladies in our group took the horse ride, never having ridden before and were well looked after by one of the young gauchos. We then returned and looked around the beautiful old estancia house, now accommodation and visited the open kitchen where the Asado (BBQ ) was being prepared. The smell wafting over the estate was mouth watering! Lunch was served on the large verandah at the front of the house. It included white or red wine, beer, soft drinks and water. They served lovely fresh salads, lettuce and cheese and tomato and onion, fresh bread, chorizo and blood sausage, grilled chicken and then three cuts of beef, ribs, sirloin and fillet, all beautifully cooked and tender. 5* lunch and service. Dessert was a special Icecream which was delicious, with coffee to follow while we were being serenaded by an elderly original gaucho, moving and delightful. We then went to the nearby paddock to see two of the younger gauchos work their magic with horses, and that was a joy to behold. A fantastic day, one we will remember for a long time and one of our favourites in Argentina. Thank you Guillermo and Jose for providing us with such a wonderful day."

There we had a welcome drink and empanadas and then we went off either to take a carriage ride or ride the horses! I was so happy to achieve a new lifetime 1st and ride a horse! Nowhere better to do that than in the Argentinean Pampas on a beautiful horse called Laura!! Thanks to those who helped make that such a great experience.

The driver was delightful and kept up a conversation and travelogue until we arrived in San Antonio to meet our guide Manuel. Due to the fact that the rest of the Buenos Aires travelers slept in and missed pick-up time, this was virtually a private tour for my husband and myself. The driver went into their hotel, phoned the room and they cancelled at the last minute. He did not delay us by waiting for them to wake, shower, dress and get to the taxi. Everything that is said about this tour is correct. We enjoyed the stops in San Antonio, did not feel pressured to make purchases and loved the gaucho experience and luncheon at the Estancia. Juan Manuel treated us as friends. Perhaps it was that we were his only customers that day, but the conversations were phenomenal, knowledge of the area and its people amazing. It was a very special experience. We also need to commend our driver who navigated a very lengthy traffic jammed return to Buenos Aires on that late Sunday afternoon with great skill and patience."

Two of our group of six senior adults rode the horses across the pampas and 4 rode in the carriage. The gauchos' work with the horses was amazing and something I had never seen. Laura even introduced me to \"mate\" which I found to be a delightful drink and social custom. The day was full of great memories for our group."

What a guy!!!To start off our day we were picked up by our lovely driver in a spacious vehicle to make our way to San Antonio... straight away he offered us chilled water (it's the little things) as we drove through Buenos Aires he provided us with interesting information both historical & general, which was a pleasant addition to our journey.Once we arrived in San Antonio de Areco we were greeted by our AMAZING guide Juan Manuel..... there aren't really words to describe this man, the soul of an English thespian stuck in an Argentinian adventurers body...!! We toured the local village which was charming and beautiful and Juan Manuel took us to local silversmiths (one of which has made products for the Queen of England) and explained and showed us in great detail all the different processes of making the products and the history of the different parts that were created for the gauchos and their horses. Juan Manuel is passionate about his home, travelling, literature, history and generally just passionate about life, which made the whole day so interesting & enjoyable for us!After the village tour we made our way to the estancia where we toured the grounds and took a horse ride with the oldest & most respected gaucho in the town, we felt incredibly honoured and humbled to have this opportunity! Following this was a lovely lunch, and they even prepared a special vegetarian option for me which I was so grateful for, not easy when you're speciality is meat export, the food was great and was followed by traditional entertainment of music and a horse demonstration. During lunch we got to spend time finding out about the ever interesting life of Juan Manuel and honestly he is one of the most interesting, passionate, knowledgeable people we have ever met, one of those rare, special humans with a big heart!Once the day was over we made our way back to the hotel with our wonderful driver! A super well organised day that was great value for money!Definitely one of the highlights of Argentina if not our whole SA trip!!Thank you Juan Manuel!!!! We hope to see you again on our next visit!!"

Afterwards, we traveled to the estancia where we enjoyed a welcoming glass of wine and empanadas, followed by horseback riding for those who desired, and a then a traditional meat-lover lunch. While we ate, an older gentleman played the guitar and sang some pleasant songs. The outing ended mid-afternoon and we were back at our hotels before 6 pm. A truly delightful trip."

My husband and I booked the private tour and we were very pleased with the service. Our driver Miguel (who picked us up at our hotel in BA) was excellent and our Guide Marie was fabulous - the fact that she was from San Antonio de Areco and that she and her family played a large role in the community made the tour especially interesting. We actually met members of her family and learned the importance and history of the craft of silver smithing in this area. After a very informative tour of the town we headed out to the estancia which was an incredible experience! We were welcomed with drinks and one of the best empanadas we had in Argentina. There was a choice of horseback riding and buggy rides (we did the latter and it was so much fun with Antonio as our driver!! - he was also the chef) and then came the Asado enjoyed on the beautiful wrap around balcony of the hacienda. Absolutely delicious and accompanied by their very tasty house label wine.Entertainment included a gaucho playing guitar and a local artist, Miguel Angel Gasparini, drawing gaucho sketches which were amazing. I was lucky enough to recieve one which is now framed and hanging in my dining room to remind me every day of that wonderful experience.There was also an incredible display of horse whispering after the lunch. You would have to see it to believe it!! Special thanks to Guillermo who organized this day for us. I would highly recommend this day tour to anyone going to Buenos Aires. It should not be missed!!!"

Guillermo responded quickly to our initial inquiry and we set up the tour. Our driver picked us up at our hotel on time and we were off to enjoy a day in the country. We had a blast. First, our driver was wonderful. His English was great but he kept apologizing for it. No need, he was easy to understand and took the time to point out thing of interest during the trip. When we arrived at San Antonio de Areco we were met by our guide, Juan Manuel Hernandez. Here's where it gets really good. He's just amazing. Handsome, funny, knowledgeable, and seems to know everyone in town. He went out of his way to make our day very special and it was. The Estancia is beautiful. The hostess is lovely, the horses were well taken care of and fun to ride, lunch was very good. I could have easily stayed there for several days. We were actually sad to leave. Highly recommended."

The official rate for the peso was 9.5 but we could exchange for a minimum of 14 pesos to the dollar. We were not given the opportunity to pay in pesos which we knew ahead of time. In light of a very strong dollar, we felt the tour was overpriced.We were picked up at our hotel at 8:15 and it took about 1.5 hours to drive to the small well to do town of San Antonio de Areco. Guillermo met us in the town square and was our tour guide for the rest of the day. He lives in the area and so had a wealth of information about the town's history. The historic town was a throwback in time with old originally furnished gaucho bars, general stores and silversmith shops/museums. It would have been nice to have stopped for a beverage and truly enjoyed the ambiance of a gaucho bar.It was interesting to visit the Museo Taller Draghi which is considered one of the best silversmiths in town. There is a small museum connected to the shop which showcases gaucho related silver pieces. We were shown original drawings that the silversmith designed to create these one of a kind pieces.We toured the church and a chocolate shop and then listened to a gentleman singing and playing his guitar.Our afternoon was spent at an authentic estancia or old working ranch. There was a wedding on the grounds at the same time so it was fun to listen to their music. We were given tasty empanadas and a beverage before our meal. We even tried mate but learned that it is an acquired taste! We were treated to a traditional asado served by gauchos. We did try the blood sausage which is an acquired taste as well. There were many servings of wonderful types of beef. A person could eat as much as they wanted. We were shown a horse and gaucho demonstration on horse taming. We were given the choice of riding a horse or riding in an open wagon which we chose the later. We arrived back at our hotel via van around 6:00 p.m."

What a truly beautiful town it is with lovely little cafes, leather shops, silver smiths not to mention hand made chocolate shop. At El Ombu (around 4 miles from the town) our small group revelled in the natural beauty of the place, the lush gardens, exquisite horses and extraordinary gauchos who took us out on a ride and later demonstrated their unique skills. Lunch was a carnivore's delight with as much barbecued meat as we could eat. I wish I had stayed on a few days as I was really sorry to leave.

I should not have worried! This was the best tour of our trip, extremely professional but warm and personal. We were picked up at our hotel by Alejandro, who was courteous and attentive, for an easy drive of around 90 mins to San Antonio de Areco where we met Guillermo, who was to look after us for the rest of the day. San Antonio is a fascinating town, which although on the tourist map, has managed to retain its culture and identity. Guillermo, a warm and charming man with good English, is obviously extremely well-known in the town and was able to show us places and introduce us to locals that I am sure others would be unable to do. The weather was excellent and we were able to visit a number of artisans from well known artists to silversmiths, leather workers and of course phenomenal chocolatiers! I was very envious of the locals who could live in such a delightful place. Next, Guillermo took us to the Estancia where we were able to sit in the shade with an empanada and glass of wine outside the main house and learn a little of the history and gaucho culture. We took a leisurely horse ride through the estate and returned for our parilla lunch. The food was delicious and plentiful (we were able to see where it was being cooked on the wood fire earlier) and it was accompanied by an excellent bottle of Mendosa wine while we contemplated our fortune to be in such wonderful surroundings. Oscar (?), a well-known and accomplished gaucho singer, played his guitar and sang to us a number of traditional gaucho songs. Finally, there was an impressive display of gaucho horse control with half a dozen horses (much to the delight of my horse loving wife!). At around four o clock it was time for our return to the city and it was with regret that we said farewell to Guillermo. It was a wonderful day and so refreshing to spend it with people who are genuinely passionate about their culture and the desire to share it with visitors. Thank you so much!"

We were picked up promptly at 0830 as scheduled by the spacious and comfortable van for the ride from Buenos Aires to the town of San Antonio de Areco. We spent some time walking around the town at a comfortable pace and had the opportunity to visit silversmiths and a delicious chocolate shop with time for shopping if we were interested. It's a beautiful and friendly town - - our guide seemed to know everyone. Definitely a world of difference from Buenos Aires. Next, we visited the estancia and we're greeted with an empanada and choice of drink while we had some leisure time before lunch. We had time to walk around and see the horses and cattle as well as the gauchos at work. Lunch commenced and was generous to say the least. We had dinner plans but ended up cancelling after having so much to eat at the estancia. Sausage, chicken, ribs, ribeye, sirloin, and tenderloin steak. And if you wanted a second portion of one (or all) of the courses, the gauchos were happy to oblige. We were also treated to traditional gaucho music by one of the veteran gauchos during lunch. After lunch there is an equestrian show in which the gaucho shows his ability to communicate and interact with the horse--very impressive and a chance for all of us to take photos with the gaucho and horse at that point. Next we were able to ride horses with the gaucho (about 20 minutes, or so) and that concluded our day around 1630.Last but not least, our tour guide, Manuel was spectacular. He is friendly, incredibly knowledgeable, and has very entertaining stories. A true Renaissance man. Of the dozens - if not hundreds - of tours I have been on in my life, I believe he is the absolute best tour guide I have encountered. The others on my tour seemed to agree. I recommend this tour, and especially Manuel, without hesitation"

The horses were really nice & well cared for and we were accompanied by several accomplished gauchos. By the time we were finished, we were very ready for our asada or barbecue and the food just kept coming. If anyone left hungry, it was their own fault. Afterwards we were entertained with guitar playing and horsemanship. we also took a tour of the Estancia because there are casitas that you can stay in. We thought it would make for a wonderful family get together if we can return one day. All in all, our day was really lovely and I can't say enough about Maria, our guide and our driver whose name I am sorry to have forgotten.

            "review": "Fabulous day!. Earlier this month, my business partner and I were on an awards trips to BA with our husbands. Most of the week in BA was pre-planned by our company's owners but we had one free day. We were spending all of the other days with our entire group of about 40 wonderful coworkers and spouses but wanted this one day to be something special for the 4 of us. I found this tour on-line and it sounded exactly like what we were looking for...and actually it far exceeded our wishes! We were picked up on time at our hotel by a wonderful driver who had a very comfortable, clean van with water bottles for each of us. We met our guide, in the quaint town of San Antonio and she gave a 'behind the scenes' tour...she was from the area so she knew everyone which she introduced us to and then they would share their stories about their businesses with us...the chocolate shop, leather shops, original general store, etc. The town's church was also filled with history that you would never know without a guide. After our tour, we then drove out to the ranch...again our guide knew everyone personally since she herself lived on a nearby ranch. We again were introduced to the ranch's owner and offered wine or beer to cool off...we then sat in the shade on the wide front lawn and enjoyed the most fabulous empanadas in this world! Then after a short walk around the grounds, we dined on perfectly grilled meats and more Malbec! Although there were several others dining, each group had their own tables and never felt like a \"tour\". Lunch included a horse show and a gaucho playing his guitar and singing....unbelievable! The day ended with a leisurely hoseback ride with two gauchos and just the four of us. If you are looking to be spoiled and to get the 'real flavor' of the ranch life...this is the only tour to consider. This ranch offers rooms for rent which is something that we all hope to do sometime soon!"

Cesar picked us up at our hotel and he is a great driver -- a welcome change from BA cab drivers. He dropped us off at the airport in time for our evening flight back to the the U.S.Manuel was our guide, whom we met in San Antonio de Areco. All the complimentary things said about Manuel in previous reviews are true. The afternoon at the estancia was almost magical. Lunch on the lawn under the trees was delightful.But the true highlight of the trip comes back to Manuel. He is deeply knowledgable about the fascinating country of Argentina and he loves to talk. Boy, does he love to talk!The tour is excellent. I would suggest a private tour with Cesar and Manuel."

Both Jose our driver and Laura at San Antonio were wonderful, informative guides who spoke fluent English.This is a touristy tour, so do not expect a working farm. The farmhouse, lunch, horse ride and gardens are beautiful, it is more a leisure day in the country than anything else as the farm is too small to be fully operating.Lunch is nice, and the empanada I had was great, maybe a couple of extra would be appreciated.The only criticism I would note is that they need to allow more time in the town to shop, the town walk is a bit rushed so maybe leave a little earlier in the morning.Offering a 1 night stay option would also be good to allow that little bit extra time to enjoy such a special place."

It turned out to be Election Day so some things were closed but Manuel showed us around the lovely old town and explained its history and we were invited in to the silversmiths workshop to see his incredible workmanship. The excursion to the estancia was wonderful, very gracious people, great food and wine, and songs from an elderly gaucho. The horse whisperer was most impressive. All the people we met were friendly and informative. Truly a highlight of our trip."

We toured the town of San Antonio de Areco, then headed to the Estancia, where we rode horses before having an amazing \"asado\" lunch. Later, we were treated to an authentic Gaucho musical performance and a horse taming demonstration that left us speechless. Everyone at the ranch was beyond helpful and made us feel welcome. Having Manuel as our guide was the icing on the cake--he was full of information and made our visit spectacular. This tour is pricier than others we considered, but you get what you pay for--this is worth every penny. This is an actual working ranch with real gauchos who work on the estancia. It's a one of a kind experience."

Lunch was amazing - do not be afraid to try the morcilla or any other things you might be nervous about - it was all delicious. Guillermo was nice enough to also make us some mate to try. 4 wheeled back out to meet Mr. Cesar for our ride home.

Afterwards, we went to El Ombu Estancia which was this beautiful ranch. We had fresh empanadas, drinks, tours of the ranch and lifestock on horseback (or by carriage, for those who aren't comfortable on horseback), had a hearty barbeque with Malbec wine, and finally listened to songs from gaucho oral tradition and watched a demo of the one of the young gauchos performing horse whispering. Overall, it was just a great time, and a nice glimpse into the Argentinian countryside so different from from the busy city life of Buenos Aires."

We were only in Buenos Aires for 5 days and I wanted to take a day trip out of the city. Based on other reviews on trip advisor I decided to go with Camino Pampa's San Antonio de Areco & Estancia Tour, and I'm so glad we did.The day was so amazing and we really learned a lot about Buenos Aires, the surrounding area and Argentina. After getting picked up by our driver Cesar at 8:30 a.m. we traveled to San Antonio de Areco where we met our guide, Guillermo. He was very well-informed about everything from Argentinian history, agriculture and current events. He was very easy to talk to and very friendly. The day trip had so much to it. Part one of the tour was in San Antonio de Areco where we visited the town square, church, a couple amazing silversmith shops, a fantastic chocolate shop and a couple Gaucho bars.Part two was at Estancia El Ombu, which was even better. We were greeted with Malbec and fresh empanadas followed by a horseback ride on the property. Then we were served an amazing spread of meats along with some more wine. Live Gaucho music and a Guacho taming a horse were after lunch. The owner of the estancia and her many canine friends were nice and welcoming.I cannot recommend this trip enough. It is very well planned and you get to see so much, but it is also very relaxing and laid back. Guillermo was a first-rate guide. You can really tell that he loves his job and enjoys sharing his knowledge and enthusiasm for the area. After dropping Guillermo off, both of us fell asleep in the car on the return trip (due to what Cesar called \"the Malbec effect\"), arriving at our hotel around 6:00 p.m. If you have a chance to do this tour, it is well worth it. Thank you Guillermo and Cesar for a wonderful day."

On arriving in San Antonio de Areca about 11 AM, we were met by Julia who gave us a guided tour of the city square with lots of information about the town's history and architecture. We also visited several silversmiths to view their shops and products. It was a display of artistry with no pressure to purchase - very nice. She then accompanied us to the estancia where we were greeted by the owner and offered empenadas and drinks of our choice. Then it was time to ride the horses - we chose the carriage ride to see the area and the crops - wheat, corn and soybeans (which are exported). As we returned the dinner bell rang. After washing up, we were offered several salads including a delicious one with corn, rice and tomatoes followed by a pork and beef sausage, blood sausage, chicken, and several cuts of beef. All were excellent and again accompanied by drinks of choice. Dessert was ice cream and coffee. Mosco Pereria, a nationally known gaucho who has led the town's parade of gauchos sang a series of traditional ballads. The owner explained that the gauchos in this area used kindness to \"break\" a horse, reminiscent of the horse whisperer. Then we watched as a gaucho demonstrated his techniques. It was amazing what the man could get the horse to do, just with kindness. I downgraded this to four stars due to the length of time involved in picking up the three couples. We were all located in different parts of Buenos Aires and it took 1.5 hours to complete the pick-up before departing for the estancia and same upon return to the city. I would have appreciated a lower price and instructions to meet at a single point. As the driver spoke limited English, there was no tour or pointing out highlights during our transit of the city in rush hour."

Our driver Jose Marie looked after us well, with a great sense of humour, and Guillermo showed us around San Antonio de Areco and the beautiful Estancia Ombu with great pride and told us lots of intersting things. The Alfajores in the little chocolate shop were the best we tasted, buy some, you won't be disappointed! The horse back ride on the Estancia was lovely, gently plodding along through the fields and past the cows. The Asado was wonderful, I have never eaten so much meat, and the horsemanship display was just incredible. You will not regret booking this trip, worth every penny!"

You will not go away hunger and that is a guarantee. It is perfectly planned out. Our day started out by being picked up from our apartment in Buenos Aires by Jose, who spoke perfect English, and was very entertaining and informative about the history of the area. He dropped us off in San Antonio de Areco, where we met our tour guide, Maria. Like Jose, Maria was very delightful and knowledgeable. We toured the quaint town and its main square, along with the church, gaucho bar, silversmith shop, and candy shop. We were fortunate to go during the week - met Maria's husband who is a silversmith along with his employees. Their craftsmanship, art drawings,displays, and the museum are amazing. Then it was off to the Estancia, where you are met with a beverage and a snack. Here, there is a carriage ride or horseback riding, gaucho singing, a demonstration by a horse whisperer, along with a meal you won't believe. The scenery is just gorgeous and peaceful. The lunch tables were setup outside and it was just so surreal. It was a great way to spend one day out of the city and relax. I hate to go into details about any of the events, because the day is something that you really need to experience. Would love to have been there or to be there on November 10th. (That will be my cliff hanger - you need to do your research for the rest of the story.) After our day was completed, Jose drove us back to our apartment. We never laughed so hard. I would like to mention that we forgot to take a picture of the cook and his grill. Jose was so kind as to take a photo the next day and email to us. Thank you Jose, Maria, Oscar, Javier and all others for a very memorable and enjoyable day."

We were picked up at our hotel by a private van, so there was no confusion about transportation and directions. Jose, Mario, the driver, was very knowledgeable about the area and made the commute enjoyable. Once we arrived in San Antonio de Areco, we were met by Guillermo, our wonderful guide. He showed us some gaucho bars and a silversmith workshop in the quaint town and we visited a chocolate store known for his alfajores. After our walk through town, we rode to the Estancia. There we rode horses alongside Oscar, the grandson of a historic gaucho, and Javier, a younger gaucho. After riding, we had a delicious lunch of a variety of meats and salad. After lunch, we listened to Oscar play guitar and sing traditional songs and watched Javier calm a horse. All in all, it was wonderful and a highlight of our trip. Camino Pampas is a great way to escape the city and experience authentic Argentine culture."

A. and proceeded to give us an in-depth explanation of all things gaucho: the town, the people, the history, the estancia, the pride and honor. It was very eye-opening and he couldn't have been nicer. He also explained scenic things on the way to San Anonio de Areco, which was very interesting, as well as answered all of our many questions. Once we arrived in San Antonio, the wonderful Laura took over for Jose Maria. Laura is a wealth of knowledge and is funny and kind. It's obvious she loves her town and its people and takes pride in the gaucho tradition and the way the town supports the gaucho life style. We also lucked out as a 92-year-old woman on a 1,000 kilometer (or was it miles?) pilgrimage was ending her walk in San Antonio at the moment we were there, at the church. It was a very special moment to be able to greet this woman with all of the townspeople and church bells ringing. After the town tour, we proceeded to the estancia. Again, what a great experience! We loved everything about it: the snack we got upon our arrival (Malbec and an empanada), our horseback riding guides, Oscar and Javier, Oscar's singing and guitar playing once we returned, the fabulous lunch (!), and observing Javier's horse-whispering skills. The grounds and architecture of the estancia are also very beautiful. If you are in Buenos Aires, you need to do this. It will open up your senses to something completely different and wonderful!"

Cesar was our very friendly, informative driver that kept us entertained for the 1 1/2 hr drive to San Antonio de Areco. Guillermo was our guide for the rest of the day and also very informative and gracious. It was another 20 minute drive out of town, then we switched to 4x4\u2019s for the last 20 minutes on a very muddy road. It had rained that day so it made for a fun ride. Horseback ride was very tame. First timers could do it. BBQ was outstanding! So much food, and delicious. We were entertained by Oscar Pereyra playing his guitar and singing. He is an old time Goucho that truly looks the part. I am so glad I paid the $5 to buy his cd. The Goucho display was not what I expected. It was the \"horse whisperer\" display, not the fancy riding and tricks. I was a little disappointed until my husband explained that what they were doing with that horse, a normal horse would never let you do. One tip.....don't wear good clothes or shoes if it has rained.\"Honorar la Tradicion es parte de neutron futuro\""

Our friendly guide, Maria, did a great job explaining all the accessories used by the gauchos and their horses and how they are manufactured. Her husband's family has a long tradition on silver manufacturing. Our driver was also very friendly and knowledgeable. Unfortunately it rained and our tour to the Estancia was greatly affected. First we had to go on a military like vehicle on an unpaved muddy road for probably 1 hour each way just to get to the ranch. It was crowded and uncomfortable. Tha is after another 1.5 hours each way from Buenos Aires. Then at the ranch the horse show was canceled and replaced by a demo of a \"horse whisperer\" which was interesting but not what we expected. It turns out that they do not have cows to herd because the fields are used for agriculture instead. So no gaucho show. The food was very good and served by friendly gauchos. My husband did the horse ride but some of us that did not want to do that could not do the carriage ride because of the muddy terrain. The property is very beautiful. They did their best to entertain us in spite of the weather but it turn out to be more of an eating/drinking event that a gaucho event. I am not sure if it is worth the long trip to the ranch and the high cost."

My wife and I selected this tour, because it offered not only an opportunity to visit an Argentine estancia to get a feel of life in the pampas, but also to visit a small provincial town. Overall, we were pleased with this experience, and would recommend taking this tour.A driver named Jose Maria picked us up at our hotel in Buenos Aires at 8:30am. Along the way, he provided a near continuous commentary about various aspects of Argentine life, particularly outside of Buenos Aires city centre, and in the pampas. We had not expected this value added service, and it was much appreciated. Also, he was a skillful driver, and was very friendly and personable.After a two-hour or less drive, we arrived at the town of San Antonio de Areco, and were greeted by a guide named Juan Manuel. He too had a wealth of information and stories to share with us, as we tour a traditional bar, a church, a traditional and a modern silversmith shops, and a chocolate confectionary shop, each of which reflected a specific aspect of the history of this town, particularly as a melting pot of immigrants from different countries. Note that the silver jewellery in Patricio Draghi and the alfajores in La Olla de Cobre are good buys.Afterwards we headed to the historic El Ombu de Areco estancia. By this time, we had become friends with Juan Manuel, who was very charming, on top of being an excellent guide. At this estancia, we had time to walk around and explore the estate manor and grounds, take a horseback or horse-drawn carriage ride around the pampas, have an ample and tasty lunch of Argentine BBQ specialties whilst being entertained by a bona fide gaucho performing traditional milonga music, and watch an amazing \"horse whisperer\" achieve complete control of his animal. Along the way, we learnt how incorrect it was to define a gaucho as a cowboy, and what that culture truly entailed.Afterwards, we exchanged contact details with Juan Manuel, bade him farewell, and headed back to Buenos Aires. Along the way, Jose Maria was kind enough to stop at a mini-market so that we could buy some water for use back in our hotel. At around 5pm, we arrived back at our hotel.It was a day well spent."

We could have had a swim in a beautifully located outdoor pool, or a horse ride instead. Later Juan Manuel joined us for a delicious 3 course lunch, wine, generous servings of barbecued meats, salad vegetables grown on the property, a very tasty icecream dessert, and coffee. All this accompanied by one of the older gauchos playing guitar and singing local songs. With other guests we watched an amazing display of \"horse whispering\" then toured the guest facilities before starting on our one and half hour return trip to Buenos Aires.

The town square was fun to visit, the church of San Antonio de Padua and its wonderful history, the silversmiths where they displayed gorgeous silver work, the Chocolate Factory with the wonderful alfajores- you must try these. They are fantastic. Upon arrival at the Estancia, we were treated to the best empanadas we had in Argentina along with some great Malbec. After horseback riding for some and a carriage ride for others, we enjoyed a fabulous lunch. Many salads made with ingredients from their garden were served. Next came grilled sausages, grilled chicken(the best I've ever tasted). grilled beef and ribs. This was followed by chocolate dipped ice cream. Great Malbec and Chardonnay as well as soft drinks and water were served as well. During lunch we were treated to some wonderful music and song presented by one of the gauchos. After lunch, another of the gauchos demonstrated how their horses are trained. After this wonderful day, we returned to Buenos Aires with lots of great memories. Next time in Argentina, we will look to spend an overnight there. They have several guest rooms. This location is beautiful. It was wonderful to hear the birds chirping and enjoy the peacefulness of the country after the hustle and bustle of BA."

In the town we were met by Juan Manuel, who was a fascinating individual. Well traveled and curious, he was easy to talk to and enthusiastic, not only about the subject matter, but about the world. A perfect person to introduce us to the history of the Gaucho and life on the Pampas.Tour of the town was brief and informative. Stopped at a local silversmith, which I thought would be a \"sales stop\" you see on other tours, but instead was simply an introduction to the relationship of silver to the Gaucho, and the iconography of the group. There was a stop at a local chocolate shop as well for what were the best Alfajors I had in Buenos Aires. Only down side was since it was a hot day, there would have been no way to hold onto the chocolates without them melting while at the Estancia. The Estancia was a peaceful setting. It was a small group (went on a Monday) of maybe 20 people. The horse ride was idyllic and tranquil, and you get a great sense of ranch and life on the pampas. Lunch was a typical feast from the parrilla, executed perfectly. Treated to traditional songs by a noted Gaucho, and a horse taming display that underlined a humane relationship between humans and horse. What a peaceful, relaxing respite from Buenos Aires. I would not only go again, but I would stay for a few nights at the Estancia's B&B."

Jose was right on time outside my hotel on Florida Ave, and unfortunately I was waiting at the wrong corner (Florida Ave a pedestrian street). Luckily I realized this and he was still there. I suggest emailing them a day or so in advance just to let them know you are still planning to be there in case this happens to you. Jose recommended the alfajores at the chocolate shop and they were very good. They will sell you some in a wooden crate so they don't break in your suitcase too. The town was interesting to see and didn't feel like a tourist trap. Gives you good opportunity to see the craftsmen. Very charming old town. The Estancia (Ombra?) is VERY nice and sooo authentic feeling and looking (because it is). Food is SO good - mm that asada meat. Wine, empanadas and more. The gaucho singer was really cool. Loved the gaucho horse whispering performance. Horse right very tranquil and just the right amount of time - about 45 min to an hour. You get to see some cool things on the road to and from along the way also, like the football stadium and some suburb neighborhoods, how people live and commute etc.Note - They ask that you pay in USD, Euros, and you pay at end so make sure you don't forget this as the charge in pesos is much higher, which is what you'd have to do if you forget.

My wife and I were picked up on November 8th promptly at 8:20 am from our Buenos Aires hotel in Recoleta by the wonderful Jose Maria. He drove us to the town of San Antonio de Areco, about 1.5 hours northwest of BsAs, and filled the entire time with history and answering our many questions. His English is excellent. We had him and the van all to ourselves because we were the only people visiting the town, while everyone else at the ranch that day went directly to the ranch. The owner of the tour company, Guillermo, was our guide in town when we arrived and we also had him to ourselves for the same reason. The colonial town was pleasant and I\u2019m glad we added that to the experience. Among other things, Guillermo showed us around the main square, the beautiful church, a gaucho bar, and a silver and leather workshop. There was absolutely no pressure to buy anything, which is always appreciated. Guillermo is from the area and his enthusiasm showed. His English is also excellent, and he is both very professional and friendly at the same time. After more than an hour in town, Jose Maria drove us a short distance out of town to the El Ombu ranch. After an informal reception of empanadas (these were some of the best we had on our vacation) and various beverages (beer, Malbec, water, etc.), we rode horseback with a few gauchos. Lunch consisted of salad, rice, slaw, sausage, and the tastiest grilled chicken and beef. The lunch was followed by guitar playing, traditional dancing, and games on horseback all performed by the gauchos. It was late afternoon by the time Jose Maria drove us back to BsAs and the conversations continued. We really enjoyed our time in the van with him and were truly sad to part company once back at our hotel. You will not be disappointed with this day trip. Everything was excellent."

We were picked up in front of our hotel in a minibus/van with only one other couple aboard, who we enjoyed getting to know during the day's trip. It was about an hour/hour and a half drive outside of Buenos Aires, but very comfortable and enjoyable. We first stopped in the city of San Antonio de Areco and saw the local church, a silversmith's museum, and an artisan chocoloate shop. The history and information that Juan Manuel gave us was great! He was knowledgeable, knew everyone, and was funny! He was a great guide! After the the tour of the town we drove to the estancia. Arriving there had me awe; It was gorgeous! We got settled in and were offered empanadas and drinks (water, juice, wine, etc.). I'm vegetarian, and forgot to email them until late the night before, but when we mentioned it to Juan Manuel, he made sure to find me a veggie friendly snack and made sure that something special was prepared for our meal later. After our snack we had the option to browse the grounds, go on a carriage ride, or ride horses. We wanted to ride horses and had the most amazing time! I'm not a rider but have gone on tourist riding experiences before and felt a little uneasy. However, this time was amazing. The saddle was different than ones I've been on before and they made you feel comfortable and secure on the horse. I didn't want to ever stop! When the ride was over, we had about 15min or so before lunch was served so they offered to take me, my friend, & our new friend from the minibus ride back out. After the ride we had lunch outdoors on the lawn with large round tables and nice table settings. We had endless wine, and to my husband's and friends' delight, what seemed like endless offerings of Argentinian meats. Lunch was amazing and our guide, Juan Manuel, ate with us. We felt like friends by the end of the meal! Afterwards, we heard live gaucho music and saw a gaucho perform a ceremony with his horse. It was one of the best life experiences I've had! While this is a tour package, it doesn't feel touristy. The tour of the town was just us six and very personal and the owner of the estancia ate lunch with us so it felt like she was just having you over to her place. If you don't go on this tour, you're missing out!"

Throughout the day I had the strongest and strangest feeling of being at home in this place so far from home. The beauty, graciousness and humility of the people and the place filled my heart. In fact, after I'd been home from the South America trip for a couple of days and put on the CD of Oscar's music, I suddenly burst into tears, so strong was the memory of that happy day. Camino Pampa provides a great service."

Our tour guide, Manuel, took us on a private tour of the town of San Antonio and even brought us to a place to get homemade alfajores. So good. Also - I had the best empanadas I've ever tasted at the estancia. The trip is worth it for the empanadas alone! I would highly recommend this service and experience. Of all we did in Argentina, this ranked among my favorites."

There we met Juan Manuel who took us on a short walking tour of the town during which we visited 3 silversmiths. The work that they produced was of the highest quality (it is used for gifts for overseas heads of state) and was absolutely beautiful. There was no suggestion that we were expected to buy anything - it was more like visiting art galleries. We then got back in our car and drove the short distance to the Estancia. Once there, we had a quick drink before doing the horse riding (which was a short but enjoyable trail ride). There was also the options of swimming or a carriage ride. We then had a bbq lunch which was excellent followed by a performance on guitar by a Gaucho and a horse whispering demonstration. We then were returned by car to BA. This was a great day out which enabled us to see a bit more of Argentina. Juan Manuel was an excellent guide - he is very interesting and tells you a lot but not too much. The Estancia is a beautiful property and everything there was very well organised and run. I really recommend this tour."

            "review": "Great day out!. Firstly we would like to thank they guys at Camino Pampa for being so flexible when we had to change the date of our tour and then the location of the pick up - everything was not a problem. On the day, we were collected on time at our hotel, we collected some other travellers and then off on the drive to the Estancia. During the trip our driver described local scenes and landmarks and being quite knowledgeable and speaking English, was able to answer some questions we had accumulated during the previous weeks in Argentina. On arrival at San Antonio de Areco - which is a quaint \"caught in time\" town, we were met by our guide, Juan, who was popular with the locals and took us on a walking tour describing the town, its history and the Gaucho culture. The tour of the pretty Church which was included, was very interesting with a couple of local jokes thrown in. The Alfajores at the chocolate shop are to die for, and the visit to the silver-smith was interesting. We were then off to the Estancia which is a beautiful old building. We were graciously greeted by one of the owners and offered a drink and some empanadas (the empanadas were excellent... the Malbec was nice too...). During this stop we were sized up for our horses and then we were off on a short ride around the property. We could have had a cart ride but everyone opted for horse-back. Not as picturesque as some rides we have done, but the horses were responsive and the riding easy. After this we enjoyed a delicious asado (bbq) under the shade of an old (planted 1806), huge, ombu tree - all you can eat and drink - accompanied by the property's dogs (they like to rescue dogs - they are VERY lucky dogs!). After this we were treated to a show of co-operation between a gaucho and his beautiful horse. Fantastic and beautifully controlled. You can see that they love their animals. This was a really enjoyable day without feeling like you were being bundled along to a tourist trap. This tour is a great way to slip out of Buenos Aires for a day."

The whole day was a delight and went exactly as we were told it would. We were met at the cruise terminal by Jose Maria, a gentleman who spoke beautiful English, was extremely knowledgeable about the area, and most importantly was patient and considerate of the senior citizens in our group. We spent much of the day with him as he drove us to the town of SA de Areco, to the estancia, and back to the cruise terminal. Once in the town we were greeted by Laura, another excellent tour guide. She had great stories and great information about the town, the history, and Argentinian life in general. We enjoyed her company very much and she also joined us at the estancia. SA de Areco is a charming town and we spent an enjoyable couple of hours there. Some members of our group were able to purchase quality leather and silver goods. The visit to the estancia was so relaxing! if you have seen the photos, you will know how beautiful it is there. The food and wine was not only plentiful, it was delicious! You will get to listen to some authentic guitar and gaucho songs from a very nice elderly gentleman and see an impressive performance of the horse whisperer. The whole day we encountered friendly, helpful, and gracious people, including the owner of the tour company, Guillermo. I would HIGHLY recommend this tour. Everyone in our group agreed that this was the best tour of the entire two weeks of their cruise. You will love this relaxing day in the countryside!"

Laura knows everything there is to know about San Antonio, estancia life, the history of the region and the gaucho and just about everything else Argentinian, including the local drink ( a rather strong and bitter tea called Mate, a really acquired taste)!All in all, a highly recommended way to spend a lovely relaxing day with a meat overload during the lunch BBQ and an amazing horse-whispering moment from one of the Estancia's gauchos."

After lunch we were entertained with guitar music performed by the elder gaucho. We then went outside and saw a performance by one the main gaucho and his horse that really highlighted the special bond they forge.

We were looking for a tour that would provide us with some knowledge of the history, geography, and culture of the Buenos Aires province, so we could connect our understanding of the economy and culture of the environs with the city of Buenos Aires. This was the perfect tour to take. Juan Manuel was the most amazing, knowledgeable, and accessible guide. The town of San Antonio de Areco is an historical town, on the Camino Real, settled by Jesuits and gauchos. The gaucho culture really comes alive here, and the exquisite crafts of silversmithing and leather work are fantastic to witness. This craftwork is explained to show the deeply personal and historical connections created here. After a great tour of the town center, we moved on to the estancia, El Ombu de Areco. The lunch there - asado and fantastic salads - was one of the very best meals we had in our week in Buenos Aires. Horseback riding for about 45 minutes allowed us to gain a perspective of the working ranch and an up-close view of the fields and birds that are unique to the area. We were treated to singing by Oscar. His musical poetry was beautifully translated by Juan Manuel and that helped us to learn so much more about the gaucho and rural culture. Everyone associated with the ranch, from the owner to the staff, were friendly and welcoming and we really learned so much from them. We were able to get access to the history and culture of Argentina and Buenos Aires in this wonderful day trip and we so appreciate the generous efforts of these local owners and guides to share their crafts and talents."

We met Juan Manuel in the main square of St Antonio de Areco and right from the off he was fantastic. Passionate, enthusiastic, genuinely knowledgable about so many subjects and a charming and likeable individual to boot. We stood on a street corner chatting and were amazed how many locals stopped to say hello, we were made to feel part of the community. We visited the leather workshop and also the silversmith. The leather work was beautiful but the silver work was just truly stunning. In both cases we met the proprietor and spent at least 30 min chatting to them. This was all because of Juan Manuel and his contacts.We then moved on to the Estansia and had an excellent lunch, including wine or beer, served by the gauchos. This was all outside in the paddock and was followed by some Gaucho music from Oscar - a real character. We also enjoyed the horse whisperer, of course this is a tourist attraction but it is wonderful to see the bond between the Gaucho and his horse. We also came to appreciate the culture and values of these marvellous men - really heart warming. All this was followed by our first ever horse ride, a perfect end to a perfect day.

He is the sort of person you can just sit and chat to for hours and indeed we did! We are still raving about the trip to anyone who will listen!"

There was insufficient time to see all the town has to offer but she was highly knowledgeable about the history and various Artisans and we were welcomed by many locals. After a short drive we were met by another 4 wheel drive truck to take us there and we drove over muddy and slippery surfaces. Upon arrival Manueline greeted us and offered drinks by the fire and we talked about the property and the people. We then went on a carriage ride through swarms of Mosquitos which was not pleasant and this lasted about 20 minutes.An excellent lunch and drinks were served and then Oscar the elder gaucho played guitar. Following which we returned back to the city.The promised horse riding demo and also gaucho skills were not offered nor mentioned and we were rather disappointed.Overall a good day out."

The driver arrived on time, and was really friendly, speaking excellent English, and chatting to us about all sorts of aspects of life in Argentina. The tour guide (Manuel) was brilliant, really friendly and very entertaining. He gave us a very interesting tour of San Antonio de Areco, with stories about the history of the place mixed in with funny stories about his childhood, and what it was like to grow up in that area. We then went off to the estancia (via an entertaining 4-wheel drive, as there had been heavy rain!), where there was an optional horse-ride followed by a fantastic asado lunch. The meat was wonderful, and the supply was never-ending. Lots of nice wine too! I would definitely recommend this tour."

My boyfriend and I enjoyed a beautiful day in the pampas thanks to our amazing, charismatic guide, Juan Manuel and the staff and gauchos at the estancia who graciously took great care of us the whole day. The love and respect Juan has for the people and traditions of Areco town really shows through as he took us around to chat with locals and to check out artisan shops and gaucho bars all while keeping us entertained with funny and engaging stories.We then made our way to a gorgeous estancia where the highlight was without a doubt the horseback riding along the sprawling estate grounds. As it was only my 2nd time on a horse, I was a bit nervous but quickly settled into the ride as my horse was calm and steady (as were all the other horses). We even had adorable border collies escorting us along the way to make sure our horses don't stray too far from the path. The ride felt like the perfect amount of time as it wasn't rushed and you really get to enjoy the fresh air and open sky. We ended the day with a delicious, endless asado all while being entertained by the beautiful music of a gaucho and his guitar and an unforgettable \"horse whisperer\" demonstration where a gaucho skillfully and hypnotically tames his horse. Time just flew in such a charming and relaxing atmosphere. Absolutely the best way to spend a relaxing, enjoyable day in the pampas!Special thanks to our driver, Cesar, who went out of his way to take us to a tasty spot to enjoy some delicious regional \"jamon crudo\". A tour that should not be missed!!"

Everything was arranged at perfection.In the morning, we were cordially picked up at our hotel by Andres and had a very pleasant drive. When we arrived in San Antonio de Areco, we were greeted by our guide: Juan Manuel, (\"one man well\". ) who is outstanding. He took us around the lovely historical town of San Antonio, and provided us with enriching information and many details about Argentinian culture. Juan Manuel speaks fluent English and French like a native speaker. His erudition and passion about culture, history and people around the world made our visit deeply interesting and meaningful. Besides, he was also very kind and attentive to everyone. We then drove to the charming Estancia and enjoyed every moment of the day. Guillermo (the organizer and owner) warmly welcomed us at our arrival and we were offered yummy empenadas with a glace of wine, before a nice horseback riding in the pampas. At our return, a delicious and copious lunch (a variety of parillada, salads, desert) was served in the shade of the majestic ombu tree, accompanied by Oscar, an old gaucho-payador, performing on his guitar. Finally, the horse whispering demonstration was amazing.Time flew by like a charm in this relaxed and friendly atmosphere. We were sad to leave! I also want to point out the fact, that after Andre dropped us back, I realized that I forgot my jacket in the van, and Andres made all the way back at our hotel to return it.Not to be missed if you are in Buenos Aires!"

This was our only day in Buenos Aires, so to take this tour meant that we did not get to see the city at all - a big decision, but the right decision! This whole day was one of the most relaxing experiences we have ever had. San Antonio de Areco is a lovely little town and it was great to be able to wander round with a small group and not be surrounded by crowds. The estancia was a delight - we opted for the carriage ride, while others did the horseback ride. Lunch under the shade of the trees, local wines, songs from a gaucho and finally the most beautiful 'horse whisperer' demonstration that brought tears to our eyes. The interaction between the gaucho and his horse was the loveliest demonstration of absolute trust between man and horse. An altogether special day - don't miss it."

Guillermo arranged our pick up for us right outside our house In a really comfy mini van. Once we arrived to San Antonio we were greated by our guide Juan Manuel. Such a friendly guy and really great guide. He looked after us for the day. We spent a little time in the town exploring the area and being taught about the history. Then, Manuel took us to the BEST chocolate shop ever. A tiny little place where all the chocolate is made in the shop, if you love chocolate this is a must! You then head over to the estancia, the grounds are breathtakingly beautiful. You get to ride a horse which is great fun, then there is a fantastic parrillada with so much food being served.

However, he was unable to control the weather...at least early on!We completed a cruise on Silversea Silver Spirit and arranged a private tour for the day and then delivery to the airport for our international flight. The logistics were made easy by Guillermo.The morning we disembarked was like a monsoon! The rain was extraordinary and flooding in Buenos Aires was everywhere making travel hazardous. We considered cancelling since we knew there was a long drive to the ranch. But, we decided to make the best of it.We were met at the port by Miguel. The bad weather delayed his arrival and he was quite apologetic about that. The bigger problem was how to get our baggage in his car. All was done and we were on our way. The rain seemed to get heavier and we wondered if we were going to be able to enjoy our tour.At San Antonio de Areco we were met by Manuel. He had umbrellas and a good positive outlook. We did a brief walking tour of San Antonio and learned quite a bit about the gaucho and its importance to Argentina. Manuel was very knowledgeable and very entertaining.We were met again by Miguel who drove us out of San Antonio to a working ranch out in the country. I had just commented to Debra about all the muddy roads off the highway and wondered how anyone could possibly travel on one given the heavy rain. Well, we were about to find out! Miguel met a four-drive vehicle where we reconnected with Manuel for a several mile drive on that seemingly impassable road. I will say the ride was exciting. Antonio was the driver as well as the foreman of the ranch. His driving was quite good in the hazardous mud. Manuel joked about the scary ride but I told him I had done that before only I had a beer in my hand at the time. Everyone laughed and relaxed.We got to the ranch and enjoyed a drink and snack on a covered patio. Then, all of a sudden, the sun came out and every cloud quickly disappeared. We soon went out on a trail ride with two gauchos and four dogs. This was not a routine tourist ride. It was the real thing! The dogs kept flushing birds out of the brush. After about an hour of riding, we returned to the ranch house for lunch and entertainment. The food was plentiful and delicious. The oldest gaucho sang to us while Manuel translated. We met the family and saw how they worked together on the ranch. Very enjoyable. But, the best was yet to come.After lunch Manuel asked if we would like to see a demonstration of a horse whisperer. We saw a young gaucho put a horse through a number of moves without anything but a bridle. The horse acted more like a big dog doing tricks for his master. Imagine a large horse on his back with his four hooves in the air while the gaucho was laying or standing on top of him! Then, Debra was invited to join them!Debra and the horse laid on the ground together for several minutes. She used the horse as a pillow and the horse never moved! Everyone was quite impressed at her courage.We videotaped the ride back so that everyone could see us in a four-wheel drive in a mud race!Manuel and all were just terrific. They were concerned that we did not enjoy ourselves because of the weather. We enjoyed ourselves immensely!This is a unique experience and I recommend it to all, regardless of age!"

It was raining heavily on this day but it cleared up later in the day when we got to the Estancia. The first part of the tour included visiting San Antonia de Areco which is a lovely historical town. We were joined by Guillermo in Areco who showed us a pub, studio of a gaucho artist and a silversmith workshop. After this visit we went to estancia. It had rained so much that we had to be driven by 4 X 4's to get there. At the estancia we were greeted by the hostress who gave us a choice of drinks (beer, wine, pop or water) along with empanadas. The estancia is a beautifully groomed, well maintained 900 acre traditional farm where can stay overnight if you wish. After the snack we opted to go for the carriage ride before lunch. The lunch was served in a charmingly decorated building with fresh linens and flowers. The lunch consisted of all you could eat salads, sausages, chicken and beef along with the choice of drinks. The desert was ice cream along with coffee. After lunch, Oscar (a gaucho) played the guitar and sang some traditional gaucho songs. This was followed by a demonstration of horse whispering. After that we were driven by the 4 X 4s back to the highway where we transferred to the van. We were then driven to the cruise terminal after we dropped off the other people. It was a very enjoyable day which allowed us to see the rural areas of Argentina. The driver, tour guides and hostess all spoke excellent English, so we got to learn all about the traditions of the gauchos. I would highly recommend this tour if you have a full day available to you while visiting Buenos Aires."

He first gave us a tour of the town, speaking of the history of the town and of gaucho culture. Manuel spoke excellent English and was on good terms with many of the locals, so we visited the local church and a number of shops to get a glimpse of the local culture.Then it was back in the car for the estancia tour. We met the owner of the estancia and began with a snack of empanadas and beer. Then there was a short horseback ride through the paddock - nothing special, but it was my first time on a horse so exciting for me nonetheless. The horses were clearly very well trained and cared for.Back at the estancia, lunch was served. As others have mentioned, it was heaven for a meat lover: it started with sausages then all the chicken, steak and ribs that you could eat. Salad was served, and to drink was a choice of wine or beer. Dessert and coffee were accompanied by a musical performance from one of the old gauchos.After lunch, one of the gauchos gave a demonstration of their horse whispering techniques - very impressive. The day finished off with a demonstration of their horse herding skills.All in all, it was a great day out. The food was amazing, the sights and cultural exposure fantastic. Manuel was clearly passionate about the region and the people and was an engaging host. (On a side note, he'd also been to Antarctica so we had some good discussions about our pending cruise to the southern continent.) Yes, it was very touristy but it didn't feel at all exploitative or excessively contrived."

The Estancia is amazing, the Gauchos and horsemanship incredible. Never was a fan of group dining but the lunch was fantastic and great fun. Not to be missed and what a great example of the differences within the country. Fantastic tour, fantastic guide, I would do it a 2nd time without hesitation. Highly recommended."

We searched and searched for an estancia trip that was personalized and finally found it through Camino Pampa; this was truly a wonderful experience.Our guide was the owner of Camino Pampa; Guillermo Guereno; he picked up the five of us in the morning at our rental apartment in Buenos Aires for the approximately 1:45 minute trip to San Antonio de Areco; this is Guillermo's home town; a charming city of 20,000 people (and I think Guillermo knows all of them!) We toured the old historical Gaucho taverns; the town square, the church and various artisans; we then drove to a lovely estancia that is still a working ranch; what a treat. There was horseback riding and wagon rides included as well as a wonderful bar-b-que lunch with wine. The gauchos' performed songs and there was a demonstration of horse whispering that was incredibly moving and amazing.I can't say enough about this trip; Guillermo is an kind and charming man; we learned a lot about Argentina and the culture during the drive and the visit to the town and estancia.For someone looking to get out of the city for the day; I highly recommend this trip; you are not hearded onto a big bus and lumped in with a lot of other people; this was a wonderful, personal expericence and well worth the time and money. Based on all the research we did; we felt the cost of this trip; it was all inclusive; was the best option we found."

That's the reason I wanted to join the tour to learn and I was not disappointed. Our guide Juan Manuel was excellent and talked with such enthusiasm in very good English. He first gave a 2 hour tour of the town of San Antonia with many historical facts. Then we were taken to one of the oldest Gaucho ranch outside of the city. We had a half hour horse back ride around the ranch led by several Gauchos, young and old. The oldest gaucho, Oscar, could also sing with his guitar. The most interesting part of the tour was a demonstration of the relationship between rider and horse. Gauchos trained their horses in a very gentle and humane way, never 'breaking' them by force. It was a illuminating experience to watch them.The tour included a very generous lunch of different cuts of beef, completed with wine from the ranch."

My group (6 people) were in Buenos Aires for 2 days as part of a South American cruise. We were picked up from the cruise ship terminal and returned in time for our departure. We picked up 2 other people in BA, so our group was only 8 people and is an excellent size for this tour. Our time in Areco was a bit short, but our guide there (a teacher during the school year) was very knowledgeable and friendly. The Estancia is beautiful. There were probably about 50 guests at the estancia while we were there, and I was told that this was a busy day. It should also be noted that the Estancia is also a guest house, so you can stay there overnight if your time permits.We went for a short horseback ride, had some of the best empanadas that we had in south America, and relaxed under a 100 year old tree while enjoying the country. Then it was lunch time. Bring your appetite. If you have never had a south American Asado before, you should know that there is lots of meat, and it comes in many courses. Do note that the first course of meats (mainly sausage) is only the first course. Some people at our table were full before the Chicken, Steak (various cuts) and ribs showed up. There is no veggie option that i saw, but lots of salad, wine and beer.The horse whisperer is amazing.If you are there on a hot day, a nice swim in the pool is also very refreshing. It was an excellent way to spent a day, and our whole group (4 - 30 year olds and 2 in their 60s) really enjoyed it all."

The Estancia Ombu de Areca was beautiful, a full lunch with a variety of meats was provided, and the Gauchos were quite impressive. Guillermo, our tour organizer also greeted and inquired if we had enjoyed our tour.

We booked this tour following the recommendations on trip advisor and did not regret it. We visited the local town with its crafts store, the local pub and church before going to the estancia. The explanations of Manuel really brought the stories and the history of the gauchos and San Antonio alive. He makes people feel welcome and engages with them on a personal level no matter which country they are from. He is full of interesting and entertaining stories and makes the tour really memorable. There is a nice and relaxed atmosphere at the estancia. The short horse ride is very relaxing and easy to do even for those without horse riding experienced. The horses basically follow the main horse on their own. The small \"show\" of the gauchos and their horses is not what you would see in a circus. It focuses in showing how close the bond is between a gaucho and his horse and how much the animals trust the gauchos. A good tour in general, a great tour with Manuel!"

We arranged a gaucho tour with Guillermo from Camino Pampa before arriving in Buenos Aires on a cruise. Guillermo arranged for a driver to pick us up at the cruise terminal, and it took us about an hour to reach San Antonio de Areco, a very traditional town where the gauchos all over the country gather once a year. In this town, Guillermo our guide met us and walked with us through this fascinating town to share with us the exciting stories about the gauchos. After about 1 hour, we went to the Estancia El Ombu which is the only working Estancia open to tourists in that area. The Estancia is very beautiful, lush and green. We were served empanadas and cold beverages including beer on arrival. Then we had the option of riding a horse or going on a traditional carriage around the Estancia. We had an Argentinean BBQ lunch when we got back. The food was excellent, and beer and red wine was included in the lunch. When we were having our desert, we were entertained by the guitar playing of the oldest gaucho of the Estancia, who is also the grandson of the most famous gaucho of Argentina. We were also entertained by a horse whisperer who was amazing. Guillermo made sure that we were back at the cruise terminal 2 hours before the departure of our cruise.We want to thank Guillermo for giving us such an amazing day. Highly recommended!"

My friends and I (11 in total) spent one Sunday in October 2013 in San Antonio de Areco and Estancia El Omb\u00fa, all arranged by the excellent agency Camino Pampa. Guillermo, our host, picked up punctually at our hotel in downtown Buenos Aires and from the very first minute he started telling us fascinating stories about the origins of the Pampas and the gauchos. The trip took around an hour and it was very relaxing. First, we made a stop at San Antonio de Areco, a very traditional town. There were very nice pulper\u00edas (gaucho bars) to visit, beautiflully handicrafted souvenirs (specially in silver) and delicious icecream and pastry. After around 1 hour we departed to Estancia El Ombu. The place was very nice, green and wide. You could really feel the spirit of the Pampas here! We were greeted with a big smile by the owners, who were prompt to serve us empanadas and cool beverages. After a nice chill moment, those who wanted to ride took a tour around and those of us who do not ride took a round trip in a traditional carriage. It was fun!When we came back, it was time for lunch and we sat under the trees along a long table. The food was excellent, all the typical things you should eat in a real Argentinean parrillada: sausages (chorizos), blood sausages (morcillas), pork, red meat and, finally, the speciality: crispy and juicy grilled lamb!After the lunch we were presented with a traditional show, including a troubadour who left nobody untouched.We left the Estancia with our hearts filled with gratitude for a very special day and we felt that we'll surely be back some day! Most of all we would like to thank Gillermo who with his humble but very experienced approach made our visit one of a kind!"

Little did we know that in the process, we'd meet one of the best tour guides in the world and have a day that was perfect in many, many ways (except for the horse flies...).I spent 3 days researching companies to take the 5 of us out of Buenos Aires to visit a ranch, and learn a bit more about the culture of this wonderful place. I found trips for all day excursions that cost between $82 and $200 per person - door to door, including horseback ride, food, and some form of entertainment from Gouchos. Although price mattered, value and quality were what we were searching for. We didn't want to have the same tour bus experience with 200 other people, nor did we want to be left to wander around for 2 or 3 hours waiting for other people to come. So the TripAdvisor reviews mattered.This was how we discovered Juan Manuel and Camino Pampa!Always a bit skeptical, I knew it would be fine when they responded to our request to book the trip quickly, told us exactly when our driver would arrive, as well as his name, and what to expect in terms of timing, and the specific tour. And they delivered.From Jose Maria's commentary as we drove our of BA in the small 8 passenger van, to meeting Juan Manuel in San Antonio de Areco, and on to the Estanzia - it all went very smoothly, we were never rushed, never bored, always engaged.The tour of the town was great - with stops in a traditional Gaucho bar, a visit to the Church, silver smith and leather shops - none overwhlemingly touristy, all high quality, where we could meet and chat with the owners/craftspeople. Because Juan Manuel is not only from San Antonio de Areco, but also because he spent half his life living in other parts of the world, he had many fascinating stories, and footnotes that helped us to learn how Argentina came to be, and also about the heritage of the people of his home town - which is one of the premier basis for Gaucho culture in South America.The visit to the Estanzia was equally superb - from the hour long horse back ride through the pastures to the multi course lunch, walks around the grounds and in the houses to the songs and horsewhispering of the gaucho's - all with maybe 30 people in total - made for a much more appealing, pleasant visit.I am very glad we chose this specific tour company and recommend them highly - you will be treated very well, from intelligent, friendly people. If you want to save a few dollars, I am told you should book directly with them, as the hotels or tourist agencies will add up to $50 on top of the fees the Camino Pampa charge.Cheers."

I had been told about a wonderful gaucho festival which occurs in November in the town of San Antonio de Areco. Since we would be without a car in Buenos Aires, and I thought it would be nice to tack on a visit to an estancia for my daughter to see farm animals, I booked the tour. We also took along my cousin and her husband and two children (6 and 9) who are from Buenos Aires. Absolutely everyone enjoyed themselves tremendously. Unfortunately the gaucho festival was postponed due to a storm, but we had so much fun that in the end the original purpose of the trip didn't matter. San Antonio de Areco is a beautiful colonial town that has preserved its character and architecture is wonderful condition. The guide was fabulous, enthusiastic, extremely knowledgeable, and made a effort to include everyone. Even the children enjoyed the city tour and hearing some of the history. The estancia was beautiful, and had many types of farm animals for the children to view (horses, cows, sheep, chickens, dogs, and a cat). The asado, empanadas and wine were of terrific quality. The beautiful setting, the warm and corteous people, the wonderful food and wine and the relaxing atmosphere made this excursion worth every penny.Some practicalities:The tour was an all day affair. We were picked up in Buenos Aires at 8:30 a.m. and returned at around 7 p.m. in the evening. Although San Antonio de Areco is about a two hour drive, the journey was very pleasant. The van was comfortable and the driver provided very interesting information along the way. The walking tour of the town is fairly short and can easily be done by people of all ages. The town has several interesting shops were braided leather and silver items could be purchased (but the shopping was not pushed or even suggested by the guide.... in fact we had to ask for the opportunity to buy a few souvenirs, which was gracioulsy provided when we asked). You will want to bring a camera, and depending on the time of year a bathing suit (there is a lovely pool at the estancia). Also one of the activities on the estancia is horseback riding. The horses are very tame and seem to know the route by heart. It was terrific for the children, and a wonderful way to see the estancia's pastoral areas. I can't think of any downside to this excursion, except that there was no baby changing station in the restroom however they were very kind in offering other options. Overall it was a terrific experience."

First of all, I have to commend Guillermo - due to our poor planning, we hadn't even contacted him about joining the tour until 11pm the previous night, and he still courteously and quickly confirmed our reservation for the following morning (lucky us!). As for the experience itself - our tour guide Manuel really made the day special. It's rare to have an experience where you can't stop smiling for hours on end, but that's what Manuel brought to our day - with his fascinating tidbits about the local history and culture, his informal, charming style, and his warmth and genuine attention to everyone's experience - he's a special guy, and he added tremendously to our experience. As for the day itself - the local town was charming, and we enjoyed the tour of the local church, bar, and silversmith's workshop - it was not at all a tourist trap - there was no shopping involved! :-) The estancia was beautiful, as were the horses. The gauchos displayed great skill in their demonstrations, and great patience with those of us with little experience riding horses across the beautiful plains. My heart wishes the ride could have been longer, although my body feels it was just right! The food was plentiful, and if not quite at the level of the best steakhouses in Buenos Aires, it was certainly a very pleasant meal with good company. The demonstrations could have been a little longer (there was no music, as some had mentioned), and a little more explanations (in English) of what we were watching would have been nice. But I can't really complain, because this tour was exactly what I hoped it would be, and I'm sure you'll love it, too!"

Everything - from the empanada and Malbec greeting to the horseback ride, the amazing barbecue lunch and gaucho music, to the almost mystical horse taming demonstration - was perfect. You and the people we met in the town and at the estancia made this a very special part of our trip. Thank you. We have already recommended you to a friend who is traveling to Argentina in the near future."

            "review": "Tour Guide Guillermo makes this a must do day trip!. Camino Pampa was recommended by our personal tour guide (Mariela from Buenos Aires Concierge) when we had requested a day at an Estancia. I had heard of others but she strongly recommended this one as so many of the others were very \"touristy\" and not what we wanted. We were picked up at our hotel at 8am and after one other quick stop to pick up 2 more people, we were on our way. Our driver made our 1 and a half hour trip very enjoyable and shared so much of his knowledge about Argentina in general and also the Gaucho traditions. The town of San Antonio de Areco is a very small town that truly holds on to it's Gaucho traditions. Once we arrived at the town square, Guillermo Gonzalez Guereno was there to meet us. Although we speak fluent Spanish, our other guests were from England and Guillermo was the perfect tour guide as his English is very fluent. The town was very interesting as we visited the church with it's strong Irish history and two gaucho bars that remain true to their heritage. Also visited were two silver craftsman where Guillermo explained the history of the silver used on the gaucho's belts along with the different knives used. It all makes so much sense when you understand the history and Guillermo made it all come to life. We then visited the silversmith that had made the silver ornamentation for our present Pope Francis. There it was very impressive to see them actually making some of the pieces on display and knowing that only three of each item would be made. This is a definite place you might want to purchase a small silver bracelet as a special keepsake. Their prices are very fair and they will accept USD. Of course, no trip is complete without a stop for chocolate and alfajores, the Argentinian cookie with dulce de leche in the middle. In this small shop, you are able to see how they are made and of course sample these delicious treats no doubt enticing you to purchase some which are worth EVERY calorie consumed! All of this takes place within 2-3 small blocks so there is minimal walking involved and you might be accompanied by several very friendly neighborhood dogs. We are picked up once again by our driver who takes us all on a 10 minute ride to the Estancia. These are beautiful grounds that also have a B&B. Upon arrival, we are met by Patricia who served us wine and empanadas that were delicious. We soon were on our way on horseback for a short ride around the vast property where most of the horses were your everyday \"trail horses\" that pretty much followed one another but if you wished and were able to, you were able to \"break from the pack\" and do some cantering around the property. If you are looking to REALLY ride horses, this is not the place to do it but more to get an appreciation of the life of a gaucho. Upon our return, we were served the BEST asado and it was never ending. My husband raved about the meat. Patricia was so gracious and made me a special salad as Guillermo had told her that I don't eat meat (but trust me, I did NOT starve in Argentina as there are so many wonderful choices of food that don't include red meat). Along with the different cuts of meat served by the gauchos, there were grilled potatos, salad, sliced tomatoes, fresh breads and wines. To top it off, coffee and your choice of flan with dulce de leche and homemade ice cream. All of it, wonderful. After lunch, one of the gauchos came running over on a horse that he has been working with for a couple of years. What he was able to accomplish with this horse was amazing and although this \"show\" might not be as flashy as other gaucho shows at different estancias, those that truly know and appreciate horses will understand and appreciate what it takes to do what this gaucho did with his horse. After, you are able to take a photo lying down with the horse and the look of serenity in his eyes is priceless. We then took a tour of the grounds with Guillermo when Patricia caught up with us again to serve us more treats of freshly made pastelitos filled with quince fruit and cream cheese...delicious! The warmth and friendliness shown by everyone made this a great day and Guillermo's knowledge made it all the better! I highly recommend spending the day with Guillermo and learning about the gaucho history. He is the ultimate host!"

Tour Guide Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez Guere\u00f1o and our driver Jose Maria Lopez were outstanding English speaking guides, historians, and Argentine hosts. I highly recommend arranging this day trip with Guillermo. We learned so much Argentine history! Jose Maria picked us up at our Buenos Aires hotel and proceeded to point out sites, neighborhoods, and the history of the pampas from our hotel all the way to San Antonio de Areco. We met Guillermo, who lives there and guided us through the historical Gaucho town, the highlight being a visit to Artist Michelangelo Gasparini's Studio, where we found several paintings of gauchos on horseback we loved and had to buy. Guillermo took us to a Gaucho bar, where sure enough, there were retired gauchos relaxing there. We also visited a silversmith who explained the history and demonstrated the process silver making. Then we went to the Estancia El Ombu where we were greeted with empanadas and wine. We went on a trail ride around the ranch with gauchos. We were then served the best Asado we had in Argentina. A traditional gaucho played the guitar and sang songs. We then toured around of the Estancia, Guillermo explained the history of the trees and bushes and their origins on the Pampas. Then we toured the inside of the mansion. I wished we had planned to stay at the Estancia a night or two. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to slow down and relax away from the hustle and bustle of Buenos Aires. Ask for Guillermo, he's the best!!! Thank you Guillermo for sharing your vast knowledge of Argentina with us!"

In no way does it mean that we didn't enjoy the day - we did very much, and 4/5 is still a good rating!I can't fault Guillermo for his professionalism and communication, he was in touch constantly prior to the day keeping us updated. Unfortunately he emailed the night before our tour to say he was unable to be our guide and that there would be a replacement guide and driver. The driver who picked us up was very prompt and professional and our guide, a lady named Veronica was very nice too. The guys who run the estancia were great, there were two opportunities to ride the horses there and the food and wine was good. Overall, I'd definitely recommend the day if you are in Buenos Aires and would like to get out into the country for a change. I'd also recommend Camino Pampa as a company who are really professional and reliable. The reason I have not given 5 stars is that I feel our day lacked a few of the special touches mentioned by some of the other reviews which seem to have made the day real value for money (as it wasn't cheap!). For example, we were not greeted at the estancia with empanadas and wine, we just had the main bbq meal. Also, there was no gaucho singing and playing guitar there. (I do realise the estancia is not actually ran by Camino Pampa and so they might not have had full control over this). Also, although our guide was very nice, it sounds like Guillermo adds a special touch to his tours and with it being just the two of us during the day, it was a little bit quiet at times. For example, our driver, though polite and professional did not chat to us much and provide info on the journey like some other reviewers have said they experienced with Guillermo (language barrier perhaps, I'm not sure!). Having said all this, I do appreciate that it was the (cold!) winter season and just 2 of us on the tour, which may have affected things. We still had a great day out and would recommend both the experience and the company to others."

From there on we started a fascinating journey about the history of the area, the gauchos' life and the culture. We went to the Estancia El Ombu where we rode horses thru the open fields of the estancia which was beautiful and a lot of fun. We finished off the afternoon eating an excellent asado with folkloric entertainment by real gauchos. Our guide Guillermo is very knowledgeable and attentive.

We enjoyed a horseback ride and then a delicious asado, a meal of assorted grilled meats, and fresh vegetable side dishes. After lunch, one of the gauchos, who cares for the horses, entertained us with gaucho songs.

A day in the Pampas with Guillermo and Camino Pampa was the perfect choice for our group of 4. Guillermo was exactly on time picking us at our hotel. The van, was newer, clean and comfortable, for the roughly 90 minute drive from BA to our first stop in San Antonio De Areco. San Antonia De Areco is a small, very walkable and picturesque town. Founded in the 1700's, there are still many wonderful old colonial buildings, and it retains a gaucho vibe to it. We were able to go into a number of preserved historic buildings, and visit the back shops of artisans shops who make leather goods and create silverworks. And although these shops sell their goods - there was no pressure to buy (but we did) After leaving the town we headed out to the estancia, it was incredibly gorgeous and peaceful...We learned the history of the estancia and area, toured the stables, and guest rooms (it's possible to stay here also - maybe next time) before deciding to take the carriage ride around the property, none of us ride -but the horses were gorgeous. It's a very laid back and relaxing atmosphere, we met other travellers and shared stories, before having a wonderful asado (grill) and steak lunch in the garden. This was followed by what looked to be the quintessential gaucho, on his guitar strumming and singing the songs and of the pampas. If it were even possible to top this we were then treated to an incredible display of gaucho horsemanship... Guillermo is an outstanding host and this was one of the most wonderful days of our trip - I'd do this day again in heartbeat!"

After doing some research, I decided to take my Mom and spend the day at Camino Pampa. What a perfect way to end what had been nothing short of a perfect trip, which was a cruise around Cape Horn! Guillermo had a driver come to pick us up for the drive to San Antonio de Areco, which was slightly over an hour outside of Buenos AIres. Guillermo met us and gave a walking tour of this charming little town, full of gaucho history. In addition, there was an unusually large Irish population that had emigrated there, so in that respect, it was like being back in the states. He took us to the church, a silversmith, a jeweler, and the equivalent of a local \"pub\". Without question, it was one of the most atmospheric little towns, with the most engaging people, we had ever seen. Afterwards, he took us to the estancia where we were treated to an asado, a barbecue lunch that consisted of beef, sausage, chicken, salad and all kinds of great food, accompanied by beverages, including great Argentine wines. We spent time with one of the gauchos, Jose Antonio, and all but adopted him! Afterwards, there was a demonstration of how the gauchos train the horses, work with and interact with them. They have a way of communicating with them that I've never seen before, almost like \"horse whisperers\". The horses have a very gentle nature, and they are such that Jose was able to get one to lay down and have some of the guests, myself included, lay down on the horse like one with one's pet dog. It was quite an experience! For anyone going to Buenos Aires, if you have the time, the city is one of the most incredible on the planet, but you will need a break from it for a day, and this is the perfect opportunity to take advantage of that. Go to Camino Pampa and see how beautiful this wonderful country really is."

Guillermo was very responsive to all of our questions via email and exceeded our expectations in every category. He made sure to let us know who was picking us up, what time they would arrive and confirmed our trip the day before. We met Guillermo in San Antonio and he took us on a tour of the town. He is clearly very knowledgeable about San Antonio, but also about about Argentinian history overall. We visited several shops in the city, but never felt pressure to buy anything. Later in the day, we went to the ranch -- the highlight of the trip. Upon our arrival, we were served delicious empanadas and our choice of beverage. We had a choice to ride a horse, ride a carriage, or just sit and relax. The ranch is absolutely gorgeous. We decided to ride the horses, which was a lot of fun. The horses were well-trained under the gauchos watch. After horse riding through the ranch, we had a delicious lunch with several cuts of meat, veggies, dessert, coffee, and wine. We highly recommend this tour with Guillermo. He is truly passionate about sharing gaucho culture and his knowledge and enthusiasm made this day very memorable."

Everybody made sure we were well looked after and we were treated as guests and not just tourists. The meal was delicious and the opportunity to learn a bit about gaucho culture was very special. We will plan to stay longer in this beautiful place on a future visit to Argentia.The booking arrangements worked perfectly and the communication and email confirmations were very helpful. We were happy to do this as a small and personal tour with very comfortable transport.All the positive reviews are well deserved."

We wanted to get out of Buenos Aires and see some of the traditional crafts and if possible an Estancia. We found Camino Pampa on the internet and booked the trip with Guillermo. Don Carmelo picked us promptly and we had a lovely drive out to the countryside. Guillermo shared the history of San Antonio de Areco, the gaucho lifestyle and culture and even taught my son to drink Mate! It was a very memorable trip and helped my son understand more of his \"patria's\" history. I enjoyed the country air, wine and food!Thanks Guillermo!

I didn't want the commercially oriented tourist experience and I found the ideal day trip with Guillermo. A small group of three, pickup from the hotels and a pleasant ride to san antonio de areco. Guillermo gave us a very informative walking tour of the town followed by a trip to the Estancia with a welcome drink and best tasting empanadas in Argentina. A horseback ride, great lunch, gaucho demonstration and a walk around the grounds completed a fantastic day before being driven back to BA. The experience exceeded my expectations. This was a tour with a personal touch achieved by Guillermo's passion for what he does, the friendliness of everyone on the estancia and the beautiful countryside. You really got the feeling of what it is to be a proud Argentinian. Highly recommended."

Guillermo's knowledge of the area & the gaucho culture was more than the translation of text from a history book. His pride in his culture was evident in every single word, it was more like the telling of a love story. I've owned horses for most of my life, worked in a riding school & ridden in many. The estancia that we visited had the most well behaved & well cared for horses in any that I've every seen. They were fat, healthy & happy.I'm very passionate about travelling, but most of the time my overall feeling is that I'm lucky to be Australian. The day with Guillermo made me wish that I was Argentine! My only question is......do they need an Australian stable hand???"

Then there was a tour of a museum, a silversmith shop, and a section of the town. The highlight of the day was the estancia, a working ranch with horse rides or a carriage ride.

My boyfriend and I recently spent the day with Guillermo visiting San Antonio de Areco and had one of the most informative and interesting days. I am a teacher and always looking for a tour based in history and Guillermo offered all that and more. I've found that some of the city tours in Buenos Aires tend to tell the same history over and over, but Guillermo's viewpoints and information is completely unique and original. If you have any knowledge of Argentine history this tour is a must because you truly can't read all the information he provides in a regular history book on Argentina or Latin America. The day started when Guillermo picked us up at our hotel in Palermo and drove us out to San Antonio de Areco. From there we toured the colonial town. We visited a silversmith shop (one of the most interesting artistic presentations I've ever seen). While there Guillermo explained the traditional dress of the gaucho and the meaning behind the silver that adornes the gaucho. He also showed us how silver is transformed from its pure form into a piece of artwork. From the silversmith shop we went for a walk around the town visiting the San Antonio church and original gaucho bars. The whole time he gave us interesting stories of the area and introduced us to many of the locals. The whole tour was very personal. After our tour of San Antonio de Areco he drove us to an estancia in the area. Upon arrival at the estancia we were greeted with wine and empanadas. Then we were invited to horseback ride around the estancia with Gaucho Oscar (one of the most famous gaucho in all of Argentina). Afterwards, we got to watch the meat get prepared along with an explanation on Argentine cooking. We then ate a very delicious and plentiful meal. There was tons of meat (sausage, chicken, and steak) along with wine, dessert, and coffee. After our meal we got to listen to a delightful music display from Gaucho Oscar (we liked it so much we bought the CD he was selling so I could share it with the students I teach). After the meal and live music we got to watch a gaucho show off his horsemanship skills and were able to take wonderful pictures lying down next to the horse. We then walked around the estancia and were given a ton of information about the trees, crops, and natural elements of the Pampas. I have to say this has probably been my favorite experience while traveling. Guillermo is very attentive with emails, information, and hospitality. I would recommend this tour highly to anyone if they are in the Buenos Aires area. Also, I think the price was very reasonable for all the activities, food, drinks, transportation, and information provided. Guillermo is the best and the tour would be very hard to beat especially those looking to experience the culture and history of Argentina."

Guerillermo picked us up with his driver Carmelo at the Four Seasons Hotel Buenos Aires and we drove out of the city to San Antonio de Areco, a town that dates from the early 18th century and preserves a great deal of gaucho traditions and craftsmen. On the way Guillermo, in perfect Engilsh, gave us a fascinating history of Argentina and the pampas and how the gaucho, and estancion or ranch life had evolved. We visited a silversmith family, famous throughout the country (and to clients like Madonna!) for their beautiful hand wrought silver treasures. We rode out with authentic Gaucho Oscar, had an al fresco steak lunch at the wonderful estancion, and were treated to some gaucho folk songs by Oscar, and an extraordinary display of horsemanship on the lawn of the estancion.We could not recommend this extraordinary day more, along with our personal tour of Buenos Aires and the dinner and tango show at Tango Rojo, it was the highlight!!"

His English is very good and he added commentary and answered questions along the way. He was born in San Antonio, grew up in Buenos Aires, and returned to San Antonio to raise his own family. Because he serves on committees that organize the gaucho festival, he has special \"backstage\" access. So after the parade, he drove us to the closed area where the gauchos (and we) had lunch. They had traditional music and dancing to entertain themselves during the meal. We were among the very, very few non-gauchos present, but we felt quite welcome. It was a special way to see an amazing spectacle. No other group offered that experience. If you're in B.A., do it!"

Guillermo gave us a tour, then we rode horses with Oscar (the famous gaucho), relaxed by the pool, then had a huge feast for lunch - multiple cuts of steak, chicken, chorizo, salads, sides, wine, desert. The meal was incredible. Oscar played some music for us on his guitar. I would highly recommend this tour for anyone who wants to visit San Antonio. Guillermo was a fantastic tour guide - very knowledgeable, friendly, knows everyone in town so he was able to introduce us, and he spoke English very well. We almost did a large group tour of a different estancia, but I'm very glad we went with Camino Pampa. It was personable and memorable, we will never forget it."

My 12 year old son and I booked in for the City walking tour, starting at Recoleta cemetery, walking through Retiro along Alvear to Plaza de Mayo. We chose the extension, so our walk was meant to last 4.5 hours and went for closer to 7!Our guide was Don, a very personable North Carolinian who has lived in BA for six years. He was a very nice man, amazingly knowledgable and pleasant to spend time with. We spent more than two hours at the cemetery and we felt we came away with a pretty reasonable basic grasp of Argentinian history, told through the stories of the characters in the tombs. Another highlight was coffee and cake at Cafe Tortoni, said to be the most famous cafe in BA. This is delightful place, old and witness to many of the greats of BA life over the years and an excellent place to rest up for a little while.I can't recommend this company or Don enough. The tours are not cheap, but are well worth the price and for anyone with limited time to spend, or looking to get a good introduction at the start of a longer trip, they are good value.My son highly recommends the tour with anyone his agePack good shoes!"

We arrived in Buenos Aires Sunday morning from the US and had no plans yet how to spend our 3 days there.I contacted Buenos Tours by email late Sunday afternoon to check availability for a full day walking Tour of the highlights of BA for the next day. It was short notice, and I didn't really expect to get a reply that evening, but Alan, the founder, got back to me within 30 minutes, telling me that yes, they do have a guide available for the next day, and we signed up for the tour.So we met Jack, our guide, on Monday morning at our hotel and he showed us the highlights of his beloved city. Jack is a very personable guy, he is fun to be around with, and he shared with us his wealth of information about the history of BA and Argentina and also patiently answered the many questions we had.We can only highly recommend Buenos Tours. It is very easy to do business with them, and you get a native English speaking tour guide, which was important to us, as we do not speak Spanish at all. We will book a tour with them again the next time we visit BA with friends.Karin, Clearwater/FL"

Do not miss the feria in San Mateo or Cafe Tortoni, a classic tourist cafe. He also knew the lesser known, but really awesome cafes in other areas.

Cheers to Jessica's office colleagues Justine and Frank as well. They were incredibly responsive to my emails and made my choice to book so easy.

Our first trip was in 2008 and we ran around the city with the Lonely Plant as our guide. For this trip we wanted to get a more in-depth experience and better understanding of the city. Buenos Aires Tours delivered that and more. Since Sunday was the only day we had completely free we opted for La Boca and San Telmo tour. I know Sunday morning can be pretty sleepy around most cities but Jessica met us at our hotel and was ready to go. Jessica currently lives in the San Telmo neighborhood and had a lot of great local insight about the area and what it\u2019s like to live in Buenos Aires. I particularly enjoyed learning about Republica de La Boca and the conversation on current events over a cup of coffee at El Federal.

Bottom line - FABULOUS!!!We read about Buenos Tours on Trip Advisor and we are so happy we booked with them.When you go to Buenos Aires, do yourself a favor and book an amazing tour with Buenos Tours before you go. We booked a private tour. Ask to have a full day escorted tour of the city. Guides are fluent in Spanish and in your language. Our guide was Ceri (pronounced as Kerry) and if the other guides with Buenos Tours are half as great as he is, you are in for a great time. With Ceri we felt like we had made a new friend! We did this \"cab/bus/walk around\" on a cruise day in port (last day before officially getting off the ship), and it gave us a great feel for this beautiful city and we were completely comfortable to go back to many of those places on our own after the cruise. Not only will you see the different neighborhoods, but also you will get to meet fascinating people of Buenos Aires as you tour the neighborhoods: like a wonderful lady who sells wines in San Telmo, the shopkeepers in the local food gallerias, along with various people you will meet along the street. We wanted to go to Boca and that is where our day began. You'll see the Recoleta neighborhood and its tree lined streets and park where you can learn to Tango. You will see the Casa Rosada (and if lucky changing of the guards) and the incredible cathedral across the street - where the guards from Casa Rosada also stand guard, a bookstore that used to be an opera house, and then you can taste the creamy gelato flavors in one of the fabulous ice cream stores. Want another treat? Go to lunch with your guide at the Caf\u00e9 Tortoni, a Buenos Aires fixture for over 100 years (where you can also book reservations for a Tango Show that will not rip you off.) And who knew a cemetery could be so fascinating? Recommendations for dinner? Just ask. No pressure, no hard sell - just honest answers. My husband and I went to a recommended San Telmo parilla for dinner --and experienced a steak you could cut with a spoon, done just right, along with salad and a huge slice of grilled provolone -- all for less than $US40. Ceri knew all of the best places to shop -- without pressuring you to buy anything. They just tell you where the best shops and values are for what you are interested in. My husband bought a beautiful handmade reversible leather jacket (suede on one side, smooth leather on the other) for a fraction of what we would have paid outside Argentina. Whether you are going for a long weekend or for an extended stay, Buenos Tours will give you a great exposure to the neighborhoods, the people and a list of places to see and things to do. Ceri gave us great advice on money. We would have never thought to do this - write your initials on currency to make sure you don't get ripped off in stores, restaurants, cafes, taxis, others who might claim you gave them \"invalid/old currency\". And how to take a taxi. He also gave us great advice on what not to carry (big purse, big backpack) when waking around by ourselves. And not to carry a camera over your neck, an iPad in your hands or anything that someone could easily grab. Thanks to Ceri - we had a fabulous first day in Buenos Aires. And his advice carried us thru..."

He was an absolute wealth of knowledge about the city, and particularly knowledgeable about Recoleta Cemetery. Touring the Cemetery with Ceri allowed us to experience so much more than we would have if we visited on our own. Ceri gave us a comprehensive history of the Cemetery and was able to point out unique architectural details that we certainly would have overlooked on our own. Ceri was also very cognizant of our interests while on the tour, and frequently checked in to make sure we weren't feeling overwhelmed by information.

He showed me some good places for food and coffee, and ice cream, of course.It was so much fun and a highlight of my trip.

            "review": "One of the Best walking tours I've ever experienced!!. Where do I start?! I booked with BuenosTours after reading the fabulous reviews on Trip Advisor. Our expectations were far exceeded. Jessica was our guide for an 8 hr walking tour. Jessica met us at our hotel in La Recoleta and from there we proceeded to visit 5 different neighborhoods in Buenos Aires, including San Telmo, San Cristobal, Barracas and Constitution. Jessica was literally a walking history book! She explained the history of of the areas we were in, including fun facts and memorable dates. She was extremely well versed in the politics, history and culture of Argentina and South America. Jessica took us to places only locals would know, and made us feel so welcome. I could go on and on! Because of her, we had an unbelievable first day in BA. She and Justine (who was so wonderful to work with via email!) even took the time to email me places to go our next two days. BuenosTours is extremely affordable and an absolute must-book if visiting BA. Justine also arranged a driver (Nick) to pick us up at the cruise terminal and take us to our hotel, as well as a transfer to the airport. I highly recommend BuenosTours as one of the best tour agencies I have ever booked with. If we return to BA, we will definitely use them again!"

Pointed to a great Parilla which we would not have found on our own - La Brigada, and to the terrace at the Park Hyatt for wine at midnight, and the amazing market on Sunday in San Telmo, and of course lunch at Gran Cafe Tortoni. We spent three days in BA (after seeing Patagonia with Mountain Travel Sobek - also outstanding and amazing) and saw and learned more thanks to spending the first day with Ceri of BuenosTours."

We only had 3 full days in BA so, based on the reviews on Trip Advisor, we decided to do the full day tour (including La Boca) with Buenos Tours (in Feb 2016). First, the booking process was seamless and the additional information provided by Buenos Tours extremely helpful (Spanish phrases, meat cuts etc).Our guide on the day was Jessica and she was of great assistance before we even got to Argentina giving us advice on our planned day trip to Uruguay (Colonia del Sacramento). It was possible to contact our guide ahead of the tour because Buenos Tours provides contact details on confirming the booking - a neat feature that we found very helpful, and Jessica responded to these additional questions patiently and with good advice (eg where to change money). Jessica is American and besides showing us the highlights of BA was also able to give us an ex-pats view of life there. She was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable. We mainly walked but also took a taxi and the bus to relocate during the tour (included in the tour price). We were glad that we had booked an exclusive tour just for the two of us - we were able to go at our own pace and linger over the things that interested us (like lunch in Cafe Tortoni).At the end of the day we felt we had really experienced BA and knew the layout of the city well. We thoroughly recommend this tour. [Don't forget to weigh yourself in the old Pharmacy]."

I originally found BuenosTours in a guide book I purchased (I think it was Lonely Planet) for Buenos Aires. Then I saw the reviews on TripAdvisor and couldn't believe how overwhelmingly positive they were. We had never been to Buenos Aires, I have always wanted to go, so I was excited to get a \"lay of the land\" via Buenos Tours and decided to book a walking tour of Recoleta and Retiro for our first full day in the city. This turned out to be an excellent idea and I highly recommend this as an intro. into the city, but regardless of when you do the tour during your trip, it'll be great. We were staying in Recoleta so we decided to start with the walking tour of that neighborhood. I was so impressed by the booking process, thoroughness of the staff via email before we even left the U.S., and amount of info. and thoughtfulness that was put into the booking process that I immediately booked a 2nd walking tour for San Telmo and La Boca for a few days later in our vacation. Both turned out to be wonderful. Our guide was Jessica and she was great, full of information from both a local and an ex-pat's perspective, plus she was very welcoming and ended up being a wealth of knowledge for us during our stay in the city. I cannot express how great it was to be on a walking tour with just my partner and a guide.. no large groups, super one-on-one, easily tailored to your pace, etc. I cannot recommend BuenosTours highly enough and would actually do more tours next time we're in Buenos Aires if we're lucky enough to return to that beautiful city again someday soon! Thanks so much BuenosTours!"

            "review": "Stellar Customer Service & Tours. I've been remiss in writing this review but my delay should not reflect negatively on Buenos Tours whatsoever. I was in BA for business in June, arriving two days early so I could see the city. From the moment I first sent an inquiry to Buenos Tours for a quote for a 1.5 day private tour to after my leisurely weekend passed, Alan was quick to respond to my emails, provided very clear and abundant details, and was very amenable and friendly. As a project manager, I'm very organized and an information hoarder; Alan eased any concerns I had.My assigned tour guide was Richard. He met me at my hotel at the appointed time and waited patiently for me since I was running a tad late from my morning flight arrival. We went over our agenda for the day and set-off. We began at Recoleta Cemetery where Richard impressed me with his immense knowledge of BA/Argentine history & its prominent players. (Recoleta is an amazing place; a must-see!) We then spent the balance of the afternoon strolling through Recoleta & Retiro. While I admired the gorgeous architecture and charming neighborhoods, Richard departed many wonderful stories and historical tidbits. We also stopped at a quaint neighborhood eatery where we enjoyed a lunch of empanadas and a boisterous server who made my day. We also made time for a gelato shop whose interior was all marble and gilt. A great find! Our first day's tour ended conveniently in Plaza San Martin, right in front of my hotel. Our second day began earlier as we had a full day's agenda. We began in La Boca with breakfast at La Perla followed by exploration of the touristy area and warren of shops where Tango was infamously founded. We then ventured into the more residential area of Boca to see the futbol stadium and get a sense of the blue collar area of BA. We also visited a local fire station and visited with the firefighters. Our next destination was San Telmo for their Sunday Market. We spent the better part of the day here shopping, eating, learning more about history & culture, admiring more fabulous architecture, meeting some of Richard's friends, and enjoying Milonga dancing. (This area is where several scenes in the Will Smith movie, \"Focus,\" was filmed.) We made a pit stop at a great Vinoteca whose proprietor gave us a lesson on local Malbec & Cabernet with a generous tasting. (Note: The tasting is not complimentary.) Late afternoon, we walked through the Monserrat neighborhood and to Microcentro to Plaza de Mayo. We explored the area, including Casa Rosada, Metropolitan Cathedral, Cabildo, and a local upcycled craft market. At dusk we chose to walk down Avenida de Mayo to see famous Cafe Tortoni and ended-up on Avenida 9 de Julio in a prime location, right where the Iguazu Falls fountain, another beautiful fountain, and an excellent view of the obelisk and Evita facade are located. There was only one more building I wanted to see - Palacio Barolo - but it was further east on Avenida de Mayo (opposite direction of my hotel) and we were already about 30-45 minutes past my allotted tour time. But, Richard was generous and wanted to ensure I saw everything I desired so we continued our walk despite it being dark. Unfortunately, right before we arrive to Palacio Barolo, we had an incident...a mustard incident to be exact. Luckily, I felt being sprayed and notified Richard immediately and thus did not allow the culprits an attempt to pickpocket us. (Poor Richard got it worse than I did, but it was still in my hair, on my jacket and jeans. Let me tell you, it wreaks horribly and is very difficult to wash out the smell and stain.) Richard offered to take me immediately back and pay for the cab. I declined because we were so close to the Barolo. We soldiered on only to arrive right after the building closed. It was disappointing but it was my fault for not mentioning wanting to visit the building earlier and planning our time accordingly. We then turned back west to find an easier spot to flag-down a taxi. When I finally found a taxi closer to Avenida 9 de Julio, I said not only goodbye to my tour guide, but my new friend. It was a disappointing way to end such a wonderful weekend, being doused in mustard/vinegar, but I refused to let it taint my experience. The next day I received an email from Alan who told me Richard informed him of the mustard incident. Alan offered his apologies and to pay to clean my clothes. I politely declined as it was not Buenos Tours fault (Richard's or otherwise) that we were targeted but I was immensely gratified by the gesture.Bottomline: Buenos Tours was exceptional to work with from the time of inquiry to post-tour. I would whole-heartedly recommend them and certainly hire them again, even just to visit with Richard for the afternoon, exploring neighborhood hidden treasures like a local. They exceeded every expectation, being knowledgeable, friendly, flexible, and customer-oriented."

We arranged the tour with Frank, who was great about responding to my emails, customizing the tour to include sights and stops to match our interests and then providing additional information about Buenos Aires including restaurant and tango recommendations. Jessica was our tour guide. She is a U.S. expat living long term in Buenos Aires. She has extensive knowledge about the city and Argentina in general and is very good at transferring this knowledge in an engaging manner. Plus, having grown up in U.S., she was able to explain Argentinean history and politics relative to our frame of reference. Jessica met us at our hotel lobby, we reviewed the plans for the day and then we were off to La Boca by taxi. We started early and were able to tour the Carminito street area before it became crowded. A short bus ride brought us to San Telmo for a walk through the neighborhood. We stopped at a local caf\u00e9 for a coffee and then walked on to Plaza de Mayo. Jessica explained the significance of the Plaza in Argentinian history and the principal buildings around it, including a stop outside Casa Rosada. We also visited the Metropolitan Cathedral and it was most impressive. Another short bus ride took us to Recoleta and a walk through this neighborhood. We stopped at a local restaurant that is known for their empanadas and sampled a variety. The tour finished with a visit to the Recoleta Cemetery, which was more impressive than anticipated. Afterwards, Jessica arranged a taxi to take us back to the San Telmo area where we were staying.I'm not able to compare BuenosTours to other agencies as we only used one during our visit, but I do feel very comfortable recommending them. You won't be disappointed with your tour."

We wanted to see the city and experience the culture but knew we couldn't do it on our own. Booking with BuenosTours was easy and lots of information was sent to us in advance to prepare for the private full day walking tour. We arranged to meet our guide, Ceri at our hotel. We wore comfortable shoes, hats, had water & sunscreen and of course, a camera. We had a very special day of seeing not only the history and architecture of the city but it's wonderful people. We had many conversations with people we met on the street or at a shop. We went to little known city gems that reinforced the feeling that we were not on a typical tour. We were with a very special gentleman, who was concerned that we got the best possible experience while visiting his city. Food: For lunch we wanted to try the beef the country is famous for & Ceri's local lunch choice was the perfect choice for us.. We had dessert later. Gelato at another local shop. Truly the best gelato I've ever eaten. To be sure we saw as much as we could, we did opt to take 2 taxis. The cost of the taxis was our responsibility. We knew this and it is explained in writing when we booked & with our guide. However, taxis are inexpensive and we had a guide who knew where we were going. It was a very good option for us on a hot day. We choose BuenosTours based on the reviews of tripadvisor travelers. We feel we made the correct decision to book with BuenosTours and will certainly book again the next time we visit this amazing city."

Never having been to Buenos Aires before and being a bit intimidated by the size of the city and the number of varied attractions we engaged Buenos Tours for the full day tour plus La Boca spread over two days. In hindsight this was a good decision as the first half day tour lasted about 6 hours and as the weather was hot and humid trying to do everything in one day would not have been as plessant an experience. Our guide Jack was very punctual and his love of the city evident. He provided us with lots of useful tips and afterwards we felt much more comfortable in travelling the city by foot and using the Subte (underground rail system)."

We feel so completely fortunate to have spent two days with the most charming, well informed guide, Jack. We are pretty well traveled independent seniors, but the scope of BA was somewhat intimidating so we booked a full day Buenos Tour split over two days, with the Boca addition which is a must. Jack was professional, funny and smart and paced our two days so beautifully. Had I known what a joy it would be I would have added some more time with him prior to our evening departure on our third day. His affinity for BA was contagious and we feel we've seen The Best of the Best."

His recommendations for our \"after-tour\" was spot on and very helpful. We also booked a day at a Gaucho Ranch. We did not even feel we were on a tour but rather that we were invited to a friend's Ranch. BuenosTours looked after everything, was quick in their response to any questions or concerns. I've used several tour companies in my travels and B.T. is reliable, professional and good value for money. Thank you to Justine, Ceri, Maria, Guillermo and the many others that made our tours memorable."

I had 2 days to visit Buenos Aires and knew that I didn't want to spend a lot of time getting lost or being taken for a ride by a taxi driver looking to pad his wallet, so I decided to take a chance with Buenostours and I am so glad I did. The first evening, the guide took me to several milongas and was extremely knowledeable about not just tango, but the social conventions that go along with it. The next day, Richard, another fabulous guide, took me all around the city and was able to tailor make the trip for my special interests. I would highly recommend Buenostours to anyone looking to see a real slice of BA."

Our guide (Jessica) was very friendly, knowledgeable and informative, she walked us through the old city, showing us street art, sculptures, wonderful churches, the Evita balcony and finishing up at the cemetery (a surprising highlight with its eccentric tombs). Jessica gave us a few rest breaks along the way, with time to have a coffee at the local cafes and to discuss local politics, art and life as an expat. We had lunch at Cafe Tortoni, a beautiful art deco caf\u00e9, full of people and a great atmosphere (a must for lunch). I would recommend this tour as a great way to see the city, and if you do go on this tour ask Jessica to introduce you to Mafalda."

I had such a fantastic time with Richard, a very interesting, personable, and knowledgable guide with similar interests who I related to perfectly. He is originally from New York but is married to an Argentinian and has such love and enthusiasm for the city, you would think he had been born there. He not only took me to the normal tourist venues but shared some more personal sites that I would not have experienced on a typical tour. We even shared a drink of mate, not my favorite drink, but worth the experience. By the end of the day, I felt like we had known eachother for years.Buenos Tours was also very detailed in their correspondence to me before I arrived in Buenos Aires and responded quickly to every question I posed.This was the best private tour I had during my vacation and I highly recommend both Richard and Buenos Tours for an outstanding experience. My only regret is not booking them for the other days I spent in Buenos Aires, however, I will definitely use them again when I return. Bravo to this company!"

Walking through the areas, eating local food( we stopped in a delicious empanada place and another local cafe for lunch), riding the local transportation, and experiencing the tour through a local's point of view.

I usually take bus tours or private tours with drivers with limited or no time at each site. I was a bit concerned about a walking tour for 8 hours so I divided it up into a PM session on arrival and AM session before our plane. The tour agency was very flexible as our plane was late so we were arrived to the hotel as the guide Richard arrived. He calmed our fears and told us to take our time checking in. Richard is an expatriate from NY who is married to an Argentinian and has lived there for around 15 years so he really understood our culture and homeland and had come to understand the history of Argentina intimately through studies and family relationships. As he toured he made many informational and humorous analogies between our home (NY) and his which made it interesting and fun. We saw every neighborhood in BA from the earliest to modern and came to understand their progressive history. We took buses and cabs and breaks in cute cafe's in between explorations. He made it easy for his two 65+ clients and I would certainly tour this way again. The second day he accommodated our plane departure so we had plenty of time to get to the airport. Thank you BA tours and absolutely recommend Richard. During high seasons he may not be able to be so flexible but if he can he will do anything to make you enjoy the tour."

Such was the case in BA....we had a WHOLE 6 six hours to spend 'touring' (Sad, I know after being there nearly a week, but we did do some excursions with our business guests) and we met with Ceri. Justine at the office was great in making the arrangements and working with our crazy window of time. We really like being on the streets as much as possible walking or taking public transit--to make the most of our time we did that AND a taxi and we were able to cover a lot of territory---We learned so much and discovered some great places to return and further explore.

He showed us how to use the subway, ride the bus, explained how the currency exchanged worked, and was very flexible with showing us places and things that we wanted to see. One great example is our desire to try Mate for the first time. He took us to a great little place, ordered for us, showed us how to prepare it, and shared it with us.

Tour - Intro to Buenos Aires and Recoleta Cemetery TourWe had been on a tour 15 years ago and wanted to repeat the experience since the first tour in 2000 was with a cruise line and the tour group was about 60 people. It was a great tour but not very personal. My goal this time was that I wanted to be able to ask more questions, gain more insight and feel free to have a discussion about the aspects that interested us without fear of being rude to other tourists (as you would, if it was a large group). We communicated in August with Buenos Tours (BT) and submitted our request, talked about our interests, some of our history and even some limitations that we have while touring. Through those email conversations they paired us with a guide who had similar interests / background and we locked into the tour. The guide was Ceri and we found him to be intelligent, insightful, patient and very professional. He did a very good job of assessing us in the beginning of the tour to get a better understanding of who we were and what our expectations were. But he did this all in a way that was friendly and very conversational (the mark of a real pro). He listened as much as he spoke and was able to \u201ccut to the chase\u201d as to what we needed and what we wanted to do. Our first stop was an exchange location where we were able to understand and become comfortable with exchanging our US currency to Argentine peso\u2019s. The famous blue dollar. He provided us a lesson in how / where to get a cab....the correct side and the wrong side for getting in and expectations on tipping. We stopped at a beautiful caf\u00e9 for a quick coffee and bathroom break before we entered the cemetery. Recoleta can be appreciated on many levels. It\u2019s an amazing cemetery, it\u2019s a slice of history that will never be repeated, the architecture is very unique, the sculpture is amazing, the mosaic tiles are beautiful. Ceri was a great guide with insights from all of those perspectives. He has a great sense of humor which both Linda and I appreciated as we toured. He confided to us that he had done a quick refresher tour for himself a few days prior so he would be able to guide us to the multiple highlights. My wife and I are both architects and have a strong interest in cemeteries from this period in time. As we entered the cemetery, the first stop was to the guard desk where Ceri spent some time joking with them and introducing us. One of the gaurds was having a mate tea break where the tea is consumed from a decorative wood cup with a silver straw. It was shared by the group. Clearly, an experience that we would not have had on our own. Recoleta is so large and when you start to spend several minutes at each mausoleum ... our morning was quickly being used. I could tell that Ceri was \u201crecalculating\u201d what he wanted to show us so that we could see \u201cthe best of\u201d before his time with us was concluded. Not an easy task when your audience is so keen to see it all. We were surprised when one of the Recoleta care-takers approached us as we were admiring a tomb and we had a conversation. Ceri has a way of speaking that shows a great deal of respect and before we knew it, the caretaker offered to show us some of his favorites and even joked about his large key ring, making him look like he was an earthly Saint Peter with the keys to heaven. Before we knew it, our time with Ceri had exceeded our tour, which Ceri was very generous with. He could see that we were still entrenched in our exploration so he recommended that we stay and continue to tour and directed us to the other areas that we had not seen yet. Ceri and BT exceeded our expectations. The informative emails in August to put the tour together were exchanged in a prompt time frame. The emails a week prior to the tour to coordinate the initial meeting were detailed and exact. The follow up after the tour has been a lot of fun too. A great guide, great tour and great tour company."

This was our second visit, so we wanted to do something different instead of riding the terrible hop-on-hop-off bus this time. I contacted Buenos Tours days before our visit and received an expeditious reply followed by a tour confirmation. We did the 3 1/2 hour city tour with Jack. Jack arrived at our hotel on time and was such a delight to spend time with. Being a history major, he was a wealth of knowledge and took us places we would not have seen otherwise. We learned a lot! Great tour, great guide. Money well spent!"

            "review": "Laughing & Crying in Buenos Aires. Before going into how special this tour was, I should state that my husband and I usually never take tours anywhere because we worry that most offer only cookie-cutter, superficial experiences to tourists. Having looked at the reviews for this company and the kinds of tours they do, however, we decided to try it out to see if this was the type of tour that offered a more intimate experience of the city.On short notice, I emailed Buenos Tours and had a very nice and friendly exchange with Alan, the company's founder, who quickly facilitated our interest in taking a half day tour (4 hours) customized to our interests. We were lucky enough to get a tour booked only 3 days from when we arrived (although I would advise that if you are interested in taking a tour, book well in advance and maybe even schedule something a day or two after arriving).On the day of the tour we met our guide, Ceri, at our hotel and discussed what we might like to see. We were interested in seeing most things and were open to wherever he thought we might like to go, which was the right decision. Not only did Ceri take us to some intriguing places (a wine shop in an art deco building, a used bookstore, a tango club, a cathedral, a cultural center, an anarchist craft fair, the Caf\u00e9 Tortoni, and many others), but he engaged us in the kind of conversation that was an experience unto itself. In other words, there was a spirit of camaraderie and affinity that developed around us, a buena onda (good vibe) as they say in Argentine Spanish. Ceri is very funny, which lends itself to this spirit easily taking shape. But he's not just funny, he knows what a genuine engagement with people looks and feels like and tries to offer that on the tour. This was proven, for instance, when he took us to a club where older people dance the tango. There, I was moved to tears by the unmediated expression we witnessed (something that seems rarely to occur in the US). No matter how old or fashionable the people were in this club, everyone looked absolutely gorgeous. We looked upon them with admiration and appreciation. I don't want to spend any more time writing here as I'd like to sit back and savor the experience, but needless to say it is well worth your time and money. Do this. You will enjoy it. Perhaps you will even laugh and cry, too!"

Oliver was so informative and personable. We really got the flavor and history of the city in the full day private excursion and felt so comfortable in this busy city. We visited four area of the city with stops for a snack and then lunch(best empanadas) within the 7 plus hours. He even departed from the routine to show us a building that we had a special interest in seeing as it related to our occupational field and other tidbits as it related to some of our personal interests. Thank you Oliver for all the memories. Additionally we took the Tango Show/Dinner with dance lesson and had a blast. The Piazzolla theatre was beautiful and we even got a private balcony table for dinner and the show. The dance lesson was fun and the shuttle bus that provided to/from service to our hotel was punctual and very clean. We would highly recommend this company and Oliver to all our friends and the trip advisor community."

Oliver was a very informative, entertaining character, his approach was unique and well enjoyed by us. He showed a high level of passion for his job and made the tour interesting despite the town being very simple and quaint. Fully recommend to do Colonia with Oliver.Secondly, we did a VIP tango dinner/ show through the same company. We had a private booth, private transfer and drinks with dinner which were all wonderful and worth the extra if you can afford it. The musicians made the show however as they played non stop between the dancers and really worked hard!The only criticism is that you are still expected to tip/ pay for the service at the tango show, which should just be all inclusive."

Our seats were amazing (we had a private booth elevated so we could see everything) and the food/wine was delicious!! We were completely captivated by the show...the dancers and the music. It was beautiful. There was a slight mix-up with the transportation to/from the venue (which was included in our VIP package) but I contacted Buenos Tours immediately and they were very receptive and helpful in making sure all was taken care of. I was impressed by their response time and willingness to help (no matter the fact it was in the evening and after business hours).

Travelling with two teenage boys I was concerned that everything could go wrong. In fact, I needn't have worried at all! Our guide, Ceri, arrived at the hotel bang on time and was friendly and engaging right from the start - even managing to get my boys interested in the Recoleta cemetery and the other sights in the vicinity (although best for them was a trip to an ice cream parlour). Not only was Ceri a great guide with loads of knowledge about BA and an opinion on everything he took us to see, but he also had loads of practical tips which helped us on the rest of our trip to BA and Argentina. Of course it helped a lot that he was a native English speaker.This tour was such a great introduction to Argentina that it really gave our trip a boost, right from the start - it was bit like taking a tour with an old friend. I really cannot recommend this company highly enough."

Buenos Aires is such a big, modern, bustling city, but I think it would be hard to see all the secret little gems that make it so enchanting to visit without a tour guide. Ceri was awesome, he took us all over the city, walking and in taxis, but we never felt rushed or tired. We had coffee, empanadas, we saw tango, and everywhere we went felt local and special. I especially appreciated the tour the next day, when my mother and I got lost and frustrated every two blocks because I am a terrible planner.

All three were excellent. The staff at Buenos tours communicate very well with you via e-mail. They answer your questions and keep you up to date with the details of your tour.Our walking tour guide, Jessica, was outstanding. She showed us things we would have otherwise missed, all while giving us a fascinating look into Buenos Aires. I would highly recommend a tour with Jessica. It goes at your pace, and you learn so much.Our day trip to the Camino Pampa estancia was the highlight of our trip to BA. This tour is priced higher than other estancia trips offered by other companies, but it is worth every penny. We were picked up by a driver (Mr. Cesar) who gave us a very nice history of Argentina on our drive to the ranch. When we arrived at San Antonia de Areco, we were met by an absolutely amazing guide--Juan Manuel. We can't say enough good things about Manuel--he was wonderful. Knowledgeable, friendly, and he clearly loves what he does. That translated into an exceptional day for us. We learned so much, and really enjoyed our day on the ranch--horseback riding, having a traditional \"asado\" lunch, and listening to traditional gaucho music. It was all topped off with a display of horse taming that was incredible to watch. This tour is worth the price of admission.Finally, we used Buenos Tours to see the Piazolla Tango show. Tango shows are clearly aimed at tourists, but again, this one was a notch above the rest. The food was average, but you're not going for the food--there's plenty of excellent food available all over Buenos Aires. Where the Piazolla Tango show stands out is the talent. The dancing was outstanding as was the live band--really a treat to watch. The added bonus was the group tango lesson before dinner. It was fun to try to tango, but it just makes you appreciate the talent level of these dancers."

We explored the sights of this diverse and colourful city. Fantastic buildings...quirky shops and cafes...interesting history and we used all available public transport including the Subway. The walking pace was as expected and we covered a lot of ground... The day was very warm so plenty of water is a must... If you can manage a full day of walking... Buenos Tours should be on your itinerary... Great Day!"

I learned more and saw more and enjoyed the tour immensely. Quincy was polite, easy going, knowledgeable and a pure pleasure. There were only two of us on the tour and I enjoyed her so much that we asked if she was free for the afternoon so we could continue and see even more. I would recommend this company to everyone and especially Quincy for making our visit even better! We visited in February of 2015 but this date was not an option for visit months on the website."

Richard is extremely informative and great company. As well as all of the usual tourist sights, he took us to a few more \"off the beaten track\" places. Highlights were the enjoying a traditional asado at lunchtime, trying Mate at Richard's studio (jury is still out on that!) and the photography tour of the little-visited barrio of Boedo, where we were invited to take photos of wonderful local sights from a pool hall to the entrance of an art deco apartment block. Excellent experience and highly recommended."

Not only did we leave the tour with a wealth of historical information and interesting facts, but we also got a great grasp of the city itself and found it easier to navigate it the rest of the trip. Ceri himself was such a pleasurable guy to be around. He has a quick wit and a great sense of humor that made the tour so fun for us.

            "review": "Perfect way to spend a day in Buenos Aires. I cannot say enough good things about this experience, so I guess I will start at the beginning.I got two days notice that I would be going to Buenos Aires for work and would have one day (Sunday) to myself upon my arrival. So I quickly went to google looking for a bus tour or traditional walking tour. Instead, I found BuenosTours.I filled out the online form and within minutes, Justine responded to me with a recommendation for a 7 hour walking tour (Buenos Aires 101) with details on the stops while also making sure to let me know that there would be opportunities to tailor my tour to fit my needs because it is a private tour so it would be just be me and the guide (if you are traveling with a group, obviously it will be your group and the guide). We went back and forth with a few questions - all of her responses being timely and extremely helpful, and I went ahead and booked the tour.After doing so, I filled out a form with more information about myself and was sent a picture of my guide, Jessica. In the form, I mentioned that Monday and Tuesday I would likely not venture far from the hotel so would be interested in recommendations from Jessica about the immediate area. I didn't even have to wait until I was on the plane before Justine had emailed me with a list of fun to do things, places to see, and restaurants to visit, all within a few blocks of my hotel. Honestly, having not traveled internationally in many years, and being a woman by myself, I was a little nervous about this trip. Just the act of booking the tour and seeing how they do business, eased a lot of my nerves.Sunday came, and Jessica met me in the lobby of my hotel promptly at 10am. We began to walk and she helped me get a bit of a general orientation of the city based on the location of my hotel. After that, we jumped into a cab to head to San Telmo, the start of the tour. If you can come on a Sunday, definitely visit the market in San Telmo. Jessica and I wandered the market, hopped into interesting architectural areas, and walked down side streets that had interesting stories and things to offer. Jessica was overwhelming knowledgable but also extraordinarily relatable. It can be nerve racking spending 7 hours one on one with a stranger - but almost immediately I felt like a friend was showing me the city as locals would see it.At the market, we came upon an antique stand with horse tack. Owning a horse of my own, I was extremely interested in this. My Spanish is minimal, at best, but Jessica helped me have a rich and informative conversation with the vendor and I was able to learn tons about the gaucho culture and the ranches in Argentina. This was a highlight for me as it included something I am passionate about at home as well. She also helped me navigate buying a souvenir for myself in the market, exchange rates, etc.We traversed the market, went inside to a food market that is there all week, and made our way into the center of the city. All the time Jessica provided me with information about the amazing immigrant history of the city, interesting facts about the origin of tango music and dancing, and information about what it is like for people currently living in this amazing neighborhood.The next highlight was Plaza de Mayo, where there was a Basque festival going on. We were actually able to go into the Pink House, and Jessica was able to tell me information about the current government as well as the history of the military state in Argentina, the Perons, and protests that often occur in the square.We then had a perfectly timed coffee stop and I followed Jessica's recommendation of getting Chocolate y Churros. Delicious! During our coffee break, Jessica was able to fill me in on the cafe culture within Buenos Aires, some of the artistic history, and current Argentine's views on their place within the world. After a nice break, we continued our walk, hopped a bus (a great experience most tourists don't get) and headed into some of the upscale, northern parts of the city. Wow are these houses gorgeous. We stopped for lunch and once again I followed Jessica's recommendation of getting empanadas that I washed down with a delicious house Malbec (I am in Argentina after all). At this point, we ran into another one on one tour from BuenosTours which seemed to be having just as much fun as us, so we decided to join together to finish the tour at the Recolata Cemetery.This place gorgeous! Both guides had amazing stories to tell about the different people buried there, pointed out details on some of the structures I would never notice, and provided a laugh (or many) along the way as well. They were right, that this Cemetary doesn't feel like a place of death but more like a celebration of life.We ended our tour with an ice cream and a good bye near my hotel. I was sad to say goodbye to Jessica as I had such a relaxed and fun time with her and felt that I probably only had the time to crack the tip of her knowledge about this amazing city.Overall, this was an unbelievable experience from my initial inquiry with Justine until the end of the tour. Jessica was so knowledgeable and able to relate that knowledge in an accessible way, tailored the tour to my interests, and really made me feel like a part of this city, all while creating an informal enough environment that it felt just like chilling with a friend. Justine (who I believe is a lot of the organization around the business) was also extremely helpful, responsive, knowledgeable, and eager to make sure my experience was amazing. All of this with only two days notice!My one regret is that I will not get to spend more time in this amazing city. I would say to anyone, skip the group tours, skip the bus tours, and take the time to do BuenosTours - it was an excellent day! I can't say thank you enough to Jessica and Justine!"

The tour and our guide Don were amazing - a highlight of our trip. He met us at our hotel .. it was like having a personal friend show you around his city. We loved La Boca, the history of Buenos Aires we learned, the chance to stop and photograph whenever we wanted, and the chance to ask every question we could think of. It was a close up look at a city with one who lived there and could share so much of his expertise.I needn't have worried about walking all day, as we didn't! During the day we took taxis, bus, & subway at opportune moments and there were refreshment, lunch stops as well. We also had input throughout the day on what WE would like to do/see next. This was the first full day of our trip to South America where we cruised around Cape Horn, and we both voted the Buenos Aires tour as the best part of the entire 2 weeks."

A gifted storyteller, Ceri made each place we visited memorable by providing insight into the history and people who made it what it is today. His love of Buenos Aires was contagious. Though this tour came at the beginning of a three week trip that took us up the coast via Uruguay and southern Brazil to Rio, it is still the highlight of the whole trip, thanks to Ceri. Buenos Tours isn't the cheapest way to see Buenos Aires, but it sure is the best. Worth every peso!"

We visetend Buenos Aires during our cruise of South America which lasted 10 weeks and our visit to BA was one of the highlights of our visit. All communication with the company before our visit went really well but there does seem to be a bit of a turnover in staff so there were a couple of changes to our name guide before we went. We also felt we were bombarded with too much information. Maybe that's a British thing? However that should not detract from the fact our guide, Jack, was excellent - warm, friendly and knowledgeable. He was unstinting of his time, and tweaked the tour exactly to fit in with our requests. We loved the included rip on the subway and also the fact he was so helpful in helping us find a place to change our currency. He also answered all our questions quite happily and gave us fantastic advice with our plans for the rest of the day after we left him and for our second day in BA. Great guy, great tour."

Ceri knew a lot about Argentine history, current cultural, politics, art and more. The day was a highlight of our three week trip through S America. He was one of the two or three best guides I have ever been with - knowledgeable, engaging, provocative, fun, and totally interested in enhancing our appreciation of BA.

Because my wife is a very serious amateur photographer, we signed up for a half day tour with BuenosTours with an emphasis on photography.BuenosTours set us up for a Sunday morning tour with Richard Shpuntoff, who is both a guide and a video maker. We exchanged several e-mails with Richard before the tour, so that he could plan an itinerary. When Richard learned that we had had a pretty comprehensive private tour two days earlier, he proposed that we explore San Telmo \u2014 where he lives and works \u2014 in depth.The tour was excellent. It gave us a much better sense of San Telmo than we would have gotten exploring the area by ourselves. Richard generously invited us to see his studio, where he produces videos, and took us to his favorite coffee shop.Richard is an expatriate American who moved to BA in 2002, when he married an Argentine. Thus, it was quite interesting to get his perspectives on Argentinean culture and politics. We enjoyed getting to know Richard, as well as seeing San Telmo.At a cost of US$130 plus tip for two people, the tour was a bargain.PS. Kudos to the BuenosTours website for alerting us to the Argentine Reciprocity Entry Fee."

The day we arrived in Buenos Aires we felt overwhelmed by the intensity and hugeness of the city and quickly realized that an orientation by an expert was in order. With one day's notice - lucky us! - BuenosTours found us an excellent guide, Ceri Foster, who completely adapted his tour to meet our needs. They also arranged for a driver to pick us up because our timeline on the day of the tour was tight. Ceri has a wealth of information, which he adeptly embedded in \"Buenos Aires lessons\" - how to use public transportation, how to stay safe and how to find the beauty of the city inside of courtyards and buildings which we otherwise wouldn't have noticed. Our afternoon with BuenosTours really got us off on the right foot!"

We booked two full day walking tours of Buenos Aires (South half one day and North the other day). In addition we booked a tour of Colonia del Sacramento in Uruguay. The tour guides met us at our hotel each day. Jessica took us to many places in BA which we would otherwise have never visited. She was a wealth of knowledge on the history and culture of the city. She tailored the pace of the tour to our individual needs and knew exactly when breaks were in order. She was wonderful. When we expressed an interest in attending a tango show at Cafe Tortoni when we returned from Patagonia, Jessica purchased tickets for us while we were gone and they were waiting for us at our hotel upon our return to BA. She definitely went above and beyond!Oliver was our guide to Colonia. He made all the arrangements for the ferry to and from Colonia. His knowledge of Colonia's history and geographic significance was spot on. He reviewed the history of the regional drink Yerba Mate, and was our cebador (server) as we sampled the drink. Best of all he knew where the best ice cream in town could be found.We would strongly recommend Buenos Tours to anyone looking for a reliable, knowledgeable, and friendly tour of Buenos Aires and the surrounding area.Bud Oliveira"

We covered so much ground in two days and we felt like we spent the days with a friend showing us around their city rather than just a tour guide!

The day of the tour, there were downpours all day and we were offered the opportunity to reschedule or proceed-completely our choice. We went for it and our guide was a real trooper- we had a full day's adventure that will stay with us forever. Ceri (by birth Canadian-English) was an amazing raconteur and shared so many insights into life in Buenos Aires that we could never have gotten. He led us around the city much more efficiently than we could have on our own (taxi, bus, and foot) and took us to some small markets, shops, cafes and no tourist traps that we would never have found on our own. We are very independent travellers- plan everything ourselves and one of us is fluent in Spanish so we would have been fine seeing Buenos Aires on our own- BUT we would never have had such a rich experience. This will stay with us forever. I would (and do) recommend this tour to anyone who has the chance. They tailor the tour to your specific interests. If you are spending several days in Buenos Aires, I highly recommend arranging a half- or full day tour for your first day with BurnosTours- it is not to be missed and it serves as a great orientation for the rest of your stay."

We were spending three nights in Buenos Aires before going on an Oceania cruise. Ever since my first contact with Alan, he was thorough and tireless in giving me advice and direction in designing a tour just for us and on things like money exchange, transportation, safety,...He was a remarkably responsive e-mailer even under heavy workload. I felt like our tour started days before we set foot in the city. Alan arranged an excellent VIP Tango dinner-show for us on the first night. On the second day, we had an in-depth tour of the city with Ceri, a multi-talented Canadian expat who was very much into the history and architecture of the city. Even our warm and enthusiastic driver, Gilbert, could easily serve as a guide himself. The following day we had an exciting cruise on River Tigre in a private boat with Oliver who is a conscientious and delightful American expat. What sets BuenosTours apart from many other tour agencies is that their staff are flexible and proficient in communicating with foreign visitors. At the end of my tours with them, I fancied taking a couple of BuenosTours guides with me to the other ports of call!"

They arranged to have a driver (Chris) pick us up at the airport (me, wife, son and son's friend) and take us to our hotel in Palermo for a quick change, and then to meet Ceri, our tour guide for the day. Ceri was incredible. Friendly, knowledgeable, funny, a native English speaker: the whole package. We began by touring the Recoleta Cemetary, where Ceri used the identity of the famous dead as a backdrop for a lesson in Argentine history. After a lunch of enpanadas and beer, we continued our tour through the area, to Alvear avenue by the perfume shop Fuegia and the Park Hyatt and Vatican Embassy. We passed the Brazilian and French Embassy before crossing the 9th of July Avenue. In Retiro we walked through the Plaza San Martin, saw the Anchorena building, Kavanaugh building and the Paz palace, before taking the subway from San Martin to Av de Mayo. We had coffee at the Cafe Tortoni, visited the national cathedral, talked about the Mavinas/Falklands, saw the Pink Palace and walked down Defensa to the Franciscan church, walked by the Puerto Rico church, the Avila bookstore and the Jesuit church by the Roca statue. We then walked up the Av de mayo, crossing the 9th of July. We saw the Palacio Barolo and the Hotel Chile (art nouveau) and then to Rodin's the Thinker in the plaza de Congreso until we stopped by the congreso and the confiteria molino. By this time, it was time to return to the hotel and get ready for a tango show, all of us feeling like we had learned a ton about this new and fascinating city.

We explained via e-mail that we only had one afternoon in BA and said we were specifically interested in Recoleta Cemetery and having lunch at Caf\u00e9 Tortoni. Based on the great response, we booked our private, half-day tour. During the booking process, we also mentioned we were specifically interested in Recoleta Cemetery and having lunch at Caf\u00e9 Tortoni, as well as our need to be back at our hotel by 5pm that day.Our guide met us at our hotel on-time and was a very nice guy. However, when he went over what we would be doing on our tour, we were surprised that we were not going to Recoleta until the end of the tour, but assumed he knew best.Throughout the tour, we did mention a couple of times how Recoleta Cemetery was a focal point of our visit... but as time went on, we finally had to come right out and ask him if we could go to the Cemetery without doing the rest of his tour first. He seemed almost upset about that, saying we'd have time to do all the tour and Recoleta and be done by 5pm. We reiterated that we needed to be AT the hotel by 5pm (and not done the tour by 5pm) and insisted we go straight to the Cemetery at that point, which we did.However, by the time we got to the Cemetery, we did NOT have enough time there (about a half hour). We definitely wished we had more time there, and were disappointed that we did not... and then had to rush to our hotel by taxi to be there by 5pm.Don't get us wrong, we enjoyed our tour and got to see a lot of BA and were given a lot of information, but... we booked a PRIVATE tour with specific requirements and in the end felt that it was our guide's tour and not \"our\" tour, customized to us.Our recommendation would to be to use BuenosTours, but if you have specific requirements, make sure they will be met. In hindsight, we should have insisted we start at the Cemetery so that we could have spent all the time we wanted to there, and then done as much of the other part of the tour that time permitted (not the other way around)."

She made sure I was comfortable with all of the arrangements and that we got the tour we wanted... And went above and beyond... And included helping to make my birthday a little bit more special.Quincy was our guide and we spent the day showing us all of the interesting places and facts of the south part of city. It was like having a friend show us around.We had a little snafu and Alan handled it quickly and to my satisfaction... Great company to deal with all around."

It is hard to beat a personalized tour...especially when you hit it off with the guide. Ceri's knowledge was fantastic - about BA and the world at large. Our conversations covered just about as much ground as the tour. He made a point of personalizing the tour based on our discussions and helped us in immeasurable ways with advice on the city, that we put into action the following days we were there. In fact we bumped into Ceri a few days later in San Telmo and it was like meeting an old friend again. Our interactions with Buenos Tours was friendly and trusting...booking, changing, followup, etc. TOP MARKS ALL ROUND"

We had planned on walking around on our own in the two days before we left for Antarctica, but after reading the very positive reviews, we decided at the last minute to see if there were any guides available. The customer service was fantastic, and we were able to book 2 half day tours, rather than a single full day tour (We were emailing them from the lobby of our hotel in BA). Don showed up in an hour, and we set off to see the historic parts of the city, including Recoleta Cemetery. Don brought such depth of knowledge and color to the tour that we really felt like we knew the city. He was great to talk with, and we enjoyed every minute. It was a great way to spend the afternoon following the overnight flight from the US.For our second half day, we had Quincy as our guide for La Boca and continuing through San Telmo and the historic city center. We didn't think that anybody could be better than Don, but Quincy was just as great. She really gave us a good feel for the city, and when we came back from our cruise, we were able to retrace some of the paths she had showed us to spend more time in some of the places she showed us.We are very glad we split it into two half day tours - it gave us some time on our own to wander around after the tours. Both Quincy and Don obviously love the city, and we started to really like it, as well. They gave us advice on restaurants and other places to see. I can't think of a better way to get an introduction to the city. There was a group tour staying at the same hotel, and their bus passed us 2-3 times while we were walking. They all seemed so disconnected from the city, sitting in a bus, rather than walking amongst the people.We also booked the Piazzolla Tango Show through BuenosTours and it was outstanding."

Our tour guides, Quincy and Jessica, are both US expats who have live in BA for six years, thus communication was not problem and their knowledge of the city and its history was thorough. They're also great people with whom to spend several hours exploring the city. All dealings with the company were via email and a pleasure. They responded very rapidly to questions and also supplied a laundry list of ways to spend the remainder of our time. In fact their website is a fantastic resource for any BA visitor, with important and up to date info about the city."

That morning we had met our guide Ceri at our hotel in Palermo for a full day walking tour, and it was definitely worth the eight hours we had spent with him, even though we were sleep deprived, and exhausted. Ceri had shown us Buenos Aires, just as we wanted to see it. Our time together felt more as if we had come to visit a friend, rather than a tour guide. From showing us all of the beautiful neighborhoods, markets, and secret little gems that BA has to offer, he showed us such a wonderful experience that it made us fall in love with the city. Ceri made our trip to BA even more memorable, and we are so glad that we had booked a tour, and met such an amazing, and interesting person to introduce us to this extraordinary city. Thank you Ceri!

We like walking and had limited time, so we decided on a full-day walking tour, including La Boca, San Telmo, the Center and Recoleta. Our guide, Richard, was WONDERFUL! He's a transplanted New Yorker who has lived in BA for the last ten years. He loves showing people around and is just a terrific person. He's also a film maker and took us for a brief detour to his studio in San Telmo. We set out to see a number of the basic sights, but as the day went on and we shared our specific interests, he modified the tour accordingly and took us to places off the set tour route. He also had great recommendations for things we could do the next day on our own (we would highly recommend both the Evita Museum and the MALBA), as well as giving us some good restaurant recommendations. BuenosTours would be at the top of my list for good walking day tours; my Fitbit said we covered almost 8 miles and it was a joy (a couple of taxi rides and a bus ride also moved us from area to area). In fact, we're now planning a trip to Patagonia next Jan and we plan to stop in BA again, where we'll definitely have Richard give us the post-graduate day tour in Buenos Aires! Mike and Roz P"

The tours were not rushed or superficial, so it was nice to get all of the information in a more relaxed and unscripted fashion.

These communities are best suited to touring as a very small group. Richard's extensive knowledge from having lived in both areas over a number of years enabled us to visit a number of unique out-of-the-way spots that we never would have come across on our own, nor been able to visit as part of a large group. Along the way we also met several skilled artisans in their little workshops, which was great, but never felt that we were getting steered or influenced in any way to buy. We were however very impressed with the unique quality of the work and plan to return to some to make purchases. This is a great tour to do on a week-day if possible, to get oriented prior to returning on Sunday for the big San Telmo market. Richard is a very knowledgeable, interesting, and personable guy; and we chatted about everything from politics to film-making to art in the tour context. If we only had more time we would have loved to do another tour with him, such as the photographer tour.If you found this review useful kindly click on Helpful YES."

To put this in context, we spent 2 weeks in Santiago / BA / MonteVideo / Rio doing this sort of thing with our two kids (15 and 17).It's crazy, really, the extent to which these guys went to make everything go smoothly. I'm not sure I've ever seen such a professional response, and certainly not in South America (sorry SA, but your customer service ability is 20 years or so behind Europe and North America. Too many companies, too many minor problems for it to be a coincidence. But these guys are an exception!)First of all, they sent a confirmation email with pictures of the driver and guide attached (ie. so we would recognize them), with every possible logistical question answered and a bunch of links to more information. We got picked up at our B&B (this in itself was impressive, as literally every taxi we took in BA had trouble finding it, despite our showing them a map and it being on an apparently normal street, a few blocks from the downtown airport) and driven to La Boca where Ceri was waiting for us.He took us on approx. 45 minutes in La Boca, then a public bus to San Telmo for another hour or so, ending up in a wine shop just off Plaza de Mayo, where he had a chilled bottle waiting for us. We hung out there with him for 20 minutes drinking it.Those are flawless logistical details. It goes without saying that Ceri's knowledge of BA, both currently and historically, seemed to be encyclopedic. What was even more impressive was his obvious love of BA specifically and travelling in general (he's from Canada and spoke flawless English and Spanish and seemed to be on a first name basis with half the people in La Boca).He's the kind of guy I occassionally meet travelling who makes me wish I could/had spend/t a lot more time actually living in different countries, instead of just visiting them. Lastly, he was great with our kids, and went out of his way to make them feel comfortable and engaged.It's really hard to think of anything Ceri or this company could have done better."

Before I booked, I had several requests, including to pick my guide (I thought I'd get along better with a woman, so I chose Jessica), to start the tour a bit later, etc. Buenos Tours was very quick to respond and more than accommodating with what I suspect were pretty unusual demands. (No doubt most people just take what they get, but as this was my first trip to BA and as I only had one day, I wanted to get the most out of it). After I booked, I received several emails from them asking what my interests were so that they could tailor the tour to me, in addition to several tips for what else to do in BA. I ended up booking a tango evening through them as well.I was really looking forward to my tour as well as the tango dinner, until fate intervened and I came down with a terrible case of strep throat. I had to cancel at the last moment - and I do mean the very last moment. In fact, due to some email difficulties, they did not receive my cancellation until the evening before my tour (and after the bus had come to pick me up for my tango dinner). I felt awful for cancelling so late, but my poor health left me with no other choice. I could not talk or swallow and my fever was such that I was starting to hallucinate.Long story short, the folks at Buenos Tours were more than understanding. They issued me a full refund on the tour, were able to negotiate a 50% refund on the tango dinner (even though the theatre had a strict no cancellation policy), and they were very kind in wishing me a quick recovery.I have never before left feedback for a tour I did not even go on, but the customer service of Buenos Tours was so superb - and so rare - that I felt obliged to do so.I am sure the tour would have been fantastic, and I will definitely be in touch with them the next time I am in Buenos Aires.

Good value for money as well.We also booked Piazzollo Tango through BA Tours and had an enjoyable and memorable evening."

Justine at BUENOS TOURS responded promptly to my email and far surpassed any company I have ever dealt with. Not only did she supply me with helpful information about tours that her company provides BUT, if her company was not what we needed she also supplied me with information about a company that would service my needs!!!!! She also offered me tips (information) about BA that visitors will find very helpful. WOW--I truly admire her for going above and beyond what was necessary to assist me, a POSSIBLE client. I recommend Buenos Tours not only for touring while in BA, but for winning the gold star as the best good will ambassador in BA!!!!!!"

She's an American who has been living in BA for some seven years. She was remarkably knowledgeable about all things Buenos Aires. I can only guess that she knows more about Buenos Aires history and culture than most native-born folks. She had majored in Latin American studies and, as I recall, Spanish as well. And, she was very friendly as well. She took an interest in what we wanted to know and, since we are Jewish, she made it a point to weave her knowledge of Jews in Buenos Aires into the tour.Jessica picked us up at our hotel and we took a taxi to the start of 7ish hour tour. I'm terrible at remembering names of places but we saw A LOT in those seven hours. The day was packed but not rushed. And, we stopped for \"lunch\" which we turned into an appetizer break, and later had ice cream.We booked the tour just a day in advance, we paid online, and the office handled our logistics perfectly.I give a 5 star review to Jessica and to Buenos tours but I'd give more stars if I could."

Setting up tours with them is a breeze and they accommodate even the pickiest of travelers. And when I say picky, I mean down to the minute picky. They go out of their way to make sure you have a wonderful experience in BA. They will pick up tickets for you to local shows and will transport you safely to your desired destination. They were on time or early EVERY TIME. They are SUPER quick to respond to email/phone and they always make sure you have all the information (plus some AWESOME suggestions) you need, ample time before the event. One of the biggest perks to this company is that they really got to know the group and made suggestions based on what they thought we would like. They made it personal and fun and an UNFORGETTABLE experience! Do not even consider another touring company, it would be a shame and a total waste of time!"

I met my guide, Richard, at the designated place and from there we walked and chatted and it was hanging out with a friend. He is extremely knowledgable with all the facts and and obviously very passionate about this city. I loved that he didn't seem to adhere to a strict schedule or itinerary. The cemetery is fascinating and it is particularly worthwhile walking through with Richard as he points out various graves, explaining who was who, the historical importance and any curious little intrigues. Walking round Retiro was also fascinating, learning of the past grandeur of all the mansions, the families who occupied them and the lifestyles they must have led. At the end of the 3 hours I felt I had a wonderful insight into the life and history of Buenos Aires."

Oliver was also great on our additional day, and he had communicated with Richard to know about us ahead of time. The highlight was the cemetary tour with Oliver as he included some really interesting (and spooky!) stories that aren't often told and is an excellent story teller. He is an actor as well so this really added to the experience when hearing about the history, etc. Overall, we really felt taken care of and that we got the most out of our short visit.The bookings team is also great - they were super fast via email with responses and sent a photo of each guide so we knew who to look out for (clever!).

It was Sunday and there was soccer match at the stadium and there were craft fairs in the streets. The air was electric with the sights, sounds, and aromas from the restaurants that had set up tables in the streets in front of their dining rooms. He escorted us around and filled us in with the history of the area and encouraged us to become part of the party.We took a bus to another area where the streets were full of street performers and live music and there were art shows and antique shops and restaurants. We felt that for the first time we were part of the fun of Buenos Aires and not just observers from an air conditioned bus.Ceri was an excellent guide who is well worth spending time with.

We met Chance at Sheraton Hotel, which was close to the port, and started our day. We had said we were interested in looking at things away from main tourist areas, and Chance showed us some great neighbourhoods, with really beautiful old buildings. We went into one of oldest cafes, and original shopping arcade and the food market. Chance had an amazing knowledge of the city and the buildings. We had lunch at very popular restaurant(Caf\u00e9 Tortoni), had to queue outside, and then waiters were bustling around . Also Chance took us into a very beautiful bookshop that had once been a theatre and all the original structures were still there. Had basically just removed the seats, all the private boxes remained, and the stage was now a caf\u00e9 , but all the lighting switches and stage props remained. Was great to see that all that hadn't been lost, when the use of the building changed. We then we out to Recoleta cemetery, and saw all the enormous tombs and Chance explained all the different methods of storing the dead. Then it was time for a gelato and a sit down inside the gelato shop, which was great after all the walking, and it had been a hot day. Chance had however tried to find shady areas to stop when we were looking at the sights.We felt very safe walking around the city, and really had an amazing day.Would totally recommend this company and our guide Chance, thank you so much"

Originally, we had planned to explore BA by ourselves, but having read some good reviews about Buenos Tours, we thought it would be worthwhile to do a walking tour and we are so glad we did.We reached out to Buenos Tours via their website and we had a prompt response about availability and options. We booked a half day tour of the City Centre & San Telmo, but after reading our traveller profile, Buenos Tours emailed us to tailor our tour a bit more based on our traveller profile (we were interested in seeing some Tango during the day). They suggested that instead of starting in San Telmo, we start in La Boca, where we'd have the opportunity to see tango dancers on the street and in some of the outdoor restaurants. I must say, it was a brilliant suggestion and ended up being one of our favorite parts of the trip.Ceri, our tour guide, met us at our hotel the day of the tour. It was an interesting day for a tour, as it was a public holiday and there was a peaceful (but major) protest in the city. However, Ceri, was able to maneuver us through the city with ease from our hotel to La Boca to San Telmo and finally into the city centre. As he got to know us, he directed us through the different neighborhoods to various things that we may find interesting and suggesting other things we may want to do / try after our tour (e.g. good wines, local parillas, places to explore by ourselves). One unexpected highlight was walking through the protest, which stretched from Casa Rosada to National Congress. As a foreigner, we never would have done this, but it was peaceful (albeit very large) and yet we felt perfectly safe with Ceri. It was truly an amazing experience.Thank you Ceri and Buenos Tours!"

First time visiting BA, it was very enlightening to learn about this long standing city. I very much look forward in returning, and hopefully soon. I highly recommend Buenos Tours as they all treat you as their family. When I was unsure of what I needed, the services were all very personalized and always offered reassurance and guidance. Between Justine and Alan, they were extremely helpful with information via e-mails PRIOR to my trip and I felt well prepared. You'll have a great time! Don't forget good walking shoes and your camera! With Buenos Tours, I feel I made friends for life!!"

It was great to be able to tour with someone who knew the city well and spoke fluent Spanish. We felt safe the entire time, including when on the subway. She showed us all the highlights and gave us recommendations for things to do the next day. It was also great to have a guide who understood our \"American\" background and outlook. We would recommend Jessica to anyone going to Buenos Aires, and particularly vistitors from the USA.."

Coordinating the tour via email was very easy and I was also given lots of great additional information regarding restaurants, entertainment options and other great practical tips. I really appreciated this since it was my very first trip to Argentina. The tour itself was great! Isabel had a great mix of information. She knew lots about the history of Buenos Aires but also tied it together with the present situation. Our tour guide had a prior career as a journalist and that really came through in her ability to make the story of Buenos Aires come alive. I came away from the tour really feeling like I knew the city and I can't wait to visit again. I would highly recommend BuenosTours and Isabel!"

I can recommend taking a private full-day (7\u00bd hours) walking trip with Buenostours to really get to know your way around Buenos Aires. Our guide, Ceri, is an ex-Canadian actor who has been living in this great city for a number of years. Although English is our second language, his clear speech was easy to follow, even for a slightly deaf elderly lady. He has a relaxed, friendly way of imparting his knowledge of the city's history, architecture, monuments and customs without being pedantic. Wear comfortable hiking shoes and a hat, because the distance covered is 11-12 km. Don't forget your camera! Ceri took us for coffee in the restaurant the Pope used to visit for his coffee break ( when he was still the Archbishop of Argentine) . We even ate the traditional Brazilian biscuit filled with milk jam - not recommended - too sweet! He could help us change US $ into Pesos at the best rate found during our whole 18- trip. The trip to the grave of Eva Peron/Duarte was another highlight."

The first tour was on a Saturday afternoon and took us from the marriott to the famous cemetery, and the second was Sunday morning and took us down to the Rose house area. Oliver was extremely knowledgable and had many side stories about the places we visited. We all had a great time and learned a lot.

I landed on BTours and am so glad I found them.Jess was just Fantastic and accommodated the 'standard' La Boca and San Telmo walking tour to fit in with the time I had. As it turned out, we managed to fit it all in including a coffee at a truly wonderful cafe that itself had so much history. An American expat, San Telmo was Jess's local neighbourhood and as such she was able to give those extra insights that only a local can give.I would thoroughly recommend Buenos Tours and will definitely look them up again when next visiting what is becoming one of my favourite cities."

This is the first review I've ever submitted, but I want to share an outstanding \"walking\" all-day, personalized tour of the city's neighborhoods and key sites. Oliver, an American emigre to BA seven or so years ago, had a passion for showing us the real BA. He was interesting, had a sense of humor, was extremely well informed about all matters Argentine, organized, understood that safety was important to us, and committed to our having an excellent experience. Don't be put off by \"all-day walking,\" as we are in our late 60s, in just reasonably good health, and had no problem with the distances or pace. There are opportunities for breaks in addition to lunch in an interesting BA restaurant. We were a party of two, so we could take a break by sitting on a park bench listening to Oliver for a few minutes here and there. We rode the subway, guided by Oliver, crossed busy streets on foot, took taxis to and from our hotel - in short, had an adventure, secure in Oliver's presence. And the price was surprisingly reasonable.The company is excellent at communications, arranged admission to a late night tango show for us, which was also exceptional.Believe me, we've taken many bus tours during our extensive travels in retirement with mostly positive results. This private tour up close in BA, on foot and using public transportation, with Oliver, however, was in a class by itself and uniquely unforgettable."

We talked and talked. She really knows the city and answered all of our questions whether about history, politics, religion..whatever. I was fascinated by her explanation of the tango dance. It made so much sense . It was fun to see her act out the dance as it was intended. I could imagine the young couple on the street dancing as she described it. What fun!We saw a lot but another highlight for me was to enjoy meeting some of her friends along the way. She is certainly well-known and well-liked. One stop was for tapas and a drink. The owner learned it was my birthday and sent over a birthday treat and congratulated me in broken English. Thank goodness for Jessica...she translated everything.We saw so much and enjoyed her company so much. The sun came out and it turned to be a most memorable day! Thank you, Jessica!"

We had had a private car tour of the city the prior day but wanted to get a better flavor of some of the city. Jessica was tremendous in providing a historical and cultural perspective and also just explaining the differences between our customs (we are from the U.S.), and those in Buenos Aires ranging from ordering ice cream at Freddo's and Volta (WONDERFUL), to understanding the cubierto on our restaurant bills, enjoying time at a cafe and what we may want to see and do on our own. She provided great guidance on getting around and what to watch out for. As with any large city you need to be aware of your surroundings. Had we more open time on our trip we would have taken another walking tour from her or her other team members. The experience far exceeded any of our expectations. Jessica obviously enjoys helping others appreciate a city she loves."

Our guide, Oliver, arrived bang on time, was friendly, articulate and very knowledgable. Our walking tour was enhanced by beautiful weather but I'm sure we would have enjoyed the experience whatever.Oliver took us to a great lunch time eatery and to Cafe Tortini for afternoon tea where he had the ability to get us to the front of the queue without appearing to try. All in all a great experience.Buenos Tours also recommended the Tango show at Piazzolla Tango which is simply one of the best things to do in the city. Don't mess about with the cheap seats, treat yourself to private transfers, private table in a box, very acceptable menu and food and a headache the next day from over indulgence in the free flowing wines. Both experiences totally brilliant."

They were amenaable to extending their normal day tour so that we could include not only the day tour but the tour to Ricoleta as well. We had an 8 hour tour by foot, bus, subay and taxi. We saw BA through the eyes of an ex-pat American who had an entirely different spin on the culture and acclamation to Argentine life. We saw the architectural, historical and political places of importance as well as the beautiful and perhaps not so beautiful aspects of life in this Argentine city. Oliver had the knack of having us at the right spot at the right time and had us take breaks at local cafes and then lunch at the oldest cafe in BA. We were all impressed by the waiters who memorize orders from 6 tables perfectly. Although the weather was ify, the 8hours passed quickly and we felt we had made a good friend as well as had the experience of a natural tour guide. He was knowlegable, prompt and courteous at all times and fielded our unending questions as the pro he is. I would highly recommend getting away from the expensive , large bus tours and get down and personal with a guide who knows more than the \"kodak\" moment spots."

My friend and I booked a private walking tour with Alan, and it was the best day we spent in our 3 weeks in Argentina. Not only was La Bocca the most interesting and bright part of the city, even on a rainy day, but I felt as though I learnt about the whole history of the city though the eyes of an early immigrant stepping off one of those boats all those decades ago. If you want to learn about the history of Tango, I'd recommend this tour."

We felt that we gained a very comprehensive overview of these historic areas; we also learned about the origins of tango, and got to see tango performed in La Boca. Being in the company of someone who was so informative (as well as being a native English speaker, fluent in Spanish) was an excellent way to see these vibrant areas of the city. Our guide was also very happy to recommend restaurants and bars in different parts of Buenos Aires - we took his advice and had some wonderful experiences whilst we were there (I particularly liked Floreria Atlantico cocktail bar, a 'secret bar' hidden in the basement of a florists, which has wonderful food, and well-made cocktails.)"

We took taxis, the metro, and, of course, we walked! Our tour covered San Telmo, Monserrat, Casa Rosada, and Recoleta Cemetery; just to name a few of the places we visited. Furthermore, we enjoyed a lovely (if slightly touristy, by our choice) lunch at the historical Cafe Tortoni. During the course of the tour, my husband's interest in South American wine became known. As our tour ended, Oliver extended his stay with us and helped my husband purchase a few bottles to take home.Furthermore, all of my interactions with the staff at BuenosTours were prompt and comprehensive.

Even with reservations you will wait over an hour, as time punctuation doesn't mean much here ( did I said that before?)Make sure to visit the cemetery as it is unique and gives one a glimpse of the society in buenos aires.We are stuck all day today at the local airport, trying to catch a flight to Iguazu Falls. No announcement nor customer service. one can not relay on internal flights as this is a third world economy and it feels very chaotic. When a flight finally boards, one could hear people cheering.Back to BuenosTours - highly recommended. Wonderful and reliable guide."

He was very sensitive to our interests and gave us advice on what else to go see (some of our stops were closed because it was a Sunday, for example Manzana Las Luces). The second day we toured Retiro, Recoleta and the Cemetery with Alan, also a terrific guide who entertained us with his knowledge of local lore and gave us several tips on places to visit. I was especially impressed with the \"personal touch\" Alan (who learned from Ceri our interest in craft beers) gave by recommending a local \"closed door restaurant\" with craft beer dinners. Unfortunately our schedule did not allow this special experience but we truly appreciated the personalized recommendation. Both Alan and Ceri were extremely helpful with other recommendations and I suspect it is a core of the business practice at BuenosTours. I highly recommend BuenosTours for a private guided walking tour of BA (but bring good walking shoes!) I felt we left BA having made new friends."

If you are a first timer as we were and only had one day, then the BA 101 tour is the way to see the main attractions and neighbourhoods. Our lovely guide Jessica took our group of seven all over the city and consistently kept us enthralled with her knowledge of the main streets & avenues, the history plus a few unexpected quirky areas.We joined this group via a roll call on a South American cruise and as per the norm we had one-day in port. The cost split between everyone was excellent value compared to one or two people. However you would move a lot quicker or have more break time if doing this walk as a couple - just costs more. Having said that, it was great to share this scenic milieu with like-minded people.We shared the cost of a taxi from the cruise terminal to our meeting point close to San Telmo and again on the way back to the ship. Fares are a little higher coming from the port (of course) but it was a quick way from this industrial shipyard. Our guide was prompt and the meeting location got us into the San Telmo neighbourhood where she regaled us with its history. After seeing Casa Rosada and Plaza we walked to Ave. De Mayo where we had a delightful late morning break at the Caf\u00e9 Tortoni. Ignore the pretentious waiter and enjoy the ambience, the coffee and delicious cakes! Frome here Jessica took us to Plaza San Martin on the Subte (underground), which is just a couple of stops. Located in the Retiro neighbourhood this leafy and up market area is simply beautiful. Everywhere in downtown BA there is superb architecture on a par with or even more stunning then Paris.We had a late lunch of tasty empanadas, wine & beer at a local restaurant (or anything else you wanted on the menu). Food and drinks are extra but worth getting into the Argentine culture. Our last stop was La Recoleta cemetery where of course we saw Eva Peron\u2019s vault (Family Duarte). In the time we had there we also saw famous and fantastically designed tombs - on the other hand some crumbling vaults had exposed coffins which was a bit sad.Do yourselves a favour, if you are able to manage a walking tour try any of the tours on their website. They simply couldn\u2019t have given us a better day out in Buenos Aires for the money - more importantly though, they gave us their expertise!We enjoyed every moment and you will too!"

I highly recommend using Buenos Tours and asking for Jessica."

Both great, both different.We walked quite a bit (which was good!); the only way to see a city.We were with our three kids, 20, 18 and 16. We obviously each liked best different parts of the town but everybody left very happy! Both our guides were a big help and talked about different parts of the Argentinian culture. It was our first stop in a 3 weeks 1/2 trip to Argentina, and lots of what we discussed with them was also useful after!"

My husband and I enjoyed three private tours with Buenos Tours during our stay in Buenos Aires \u2013 the \u2018Retiro, Recoleta & Cemetery\u2019 tour with Oliver, the \u2018La Boca & San Telmo\u2019 tour with Jessica and the \u2018Historical City Centre Tour\u2019 with Chance. In terms of content, the \u2018Retiro, Recoleta & the Cemetery\u2019 tour was our favorite. Buenos Tours have you complete a series of questions when you book (about your interests etc.) and each guide actually took the time to pre-read this and had suggestions ready to modify our tour to our interests. This was really impressive! What was also great was being sent a picture and little biography on each guide before the tour so you knew a little about your guide also! We defiantly saw more of Buenos Aires doing these tours than we would have discovered on our own. I was pregnant and also love stopping to take photos and the pace of the tours was spot-on. We also asked Chance to help us exchange some money on the \u2018blue market\u2019 and he was more than accommodating. If fact, he was so \u2018into\u2019 the tour we run over time by over an hour. Time flew by on each of the tours, an indication of how much fun we were having. We also booked tickets for Piazzolla Tango through Buenos Tours and saved 10%. Do yourself a favor and book private tours with Buenos Tours rather than group / bus tours!"

Considering we only had two days to go sight seeing, I really wanted to make the most of our time.I found BuenosTours on Trip Advisor and booked a half-day tour of Retiro, Recoleta and the Recoleta Cemetery. (Looking back, I wish I had booked a full-day tour!)Even before I left Santiago, Alan had sent me a personalised two-paged e-mail recommending how we should spend our time in Buenos Aires after the tour finished. His recommendations were based on a short questionnaire I had filled out during the booking process.Oliver, our guide, punctually met us at our hotel and took us by taxi to our destination. Oliver is a U.S. expat who has acclimated extremely well to the Argentine culture. He easily foresees needs, questions and doubts tourists may have and yet, I felt we were being shown around by a \"Porte\u00f1o\" (someone born and raised in Buenos Aires). Oliver patiently answered a lot of my questions that didn't have anything to do with the tour itself, such as, how to use the subway, exchange money, and plan the next day's itinerary. Needless to say, the tour itself was amazing. My first trip to Buenos Aires was a huge success thanks to Alan and Oliver and I plan on doing a different tour with them on my next visit. Thanks guys!"

We had a bit of a tricky time getting to Buenos Aires (airlines issues/lost luggage), but once we hit the pavement with our guide, Oliver, things began looking up. For anyone who has lost luggage, you know it's a drain, particularly after a full day in transit. We almost canceled our tour, and we are so glad we didn't. Oliver, a US expat, saw that we had little more than lightweight clothes while our heavier clothing meandered from the States to BA. Oliver made some adjustments, detouring straight away to Av. Santa Fe where we swiftly found some jackets for my two daughters (preteens -- not an easy task!). Within about 30 minutes we were officially on tour, garnering an extra site, El Ateno, for good measure.Oliver is enthusiastic and obviously loves his adoptive country. He enjoys history, local folklore and offers up a few curious urban legends during the full tour through San Telmo, Micro Central, Recoleta, to name just a few districts. He illustrated the major historical, religious, cultural (arts, tango, etc.) and political sites. He engaged not just the adults but made particular effort to engage our daughters as well, who took pride in challenging his knowledge of the symbols on the mausoleums in the Recoleta Cemetery. (Smile, Oliver!) The greatest benefit for us was that he provided an excellent foundation to create our own more detailed explorations geared to our personal interests the remainder of our stay. For these reasons and many more, I definitely recommend the full-day walking tour with Buenos Tours. The walk itself was not particularly difficult nor strenuous. The day was broken up by a snack/breakfast and lunch at some of the city's popular cafes.Buenos Aires was an incredible city with so much to offer. Not only would we return to the city, but we'd definitely give our new friends at Buenos Tours a ring to see what new offerings they might have at that time."

We never felt rushed or hurried, and Oliver knew the answers to all of my questions, not matter how mundane or seemingly off-topic they might have seemed :) I learned a lot, and really enjoyed seeing the sights through the eyes of someone who has such a firm grasp on the local culture. Oliver was also able to make recommendations about what else to see and do during our visit, which was super helpful. My favorite part of my trip to Buenos Aires!"

Highlights were the morning tea stop at the atmospheric 'poets corner restaurant',the necropolis and for an avid junk fossicker like me, San Telmo. Our overriding impression was that we had barely scratched the surface and needed to go back for more, and our 2-day stopover was far too short !"

The stops for morning tea and lunch were wonderful choices and not only the knowledge but the confidence Chance gave us on the streets in BA set our weeks holiday up to be so enjoyable.

We went with her two separate times during our visit. She is personable, friendly, knowledgeable, punctual and plans the tours extremely well. We saw what we expected to see and she was also flexible enough to allow us extra time in one place or another if we saw something we wanted to see along the way. She also plans the tour so that mid way we would make a stop at a cafe to rest, get a snack, talk about the city and have our questions answered. Jessica was also very helpful in recommending shops and restaurants for us to explore on our own. Besides her skills as a tour guide, the fact that she was originally from the United States and we shared a common background made it easy for us to relate to her which in turn made it easier for her to compare our culture and experiences with those in Argentina. It was like having a friend with us instead of a tour guide. The time we spent with Jessica went very quickly, was most enjoyable and we would most heartily recommend her to anyone traveling to Buenos Aires."

By the time we parted ways, I felt much more like a local than I expected, which meant we could enjoy the rest of our week with that much more confidence and excitement.

To have a photograph of the guide, and make contact beforehand was definitely reassuring.We took a half day tour with Chance the day we arrived, after a 13 hour flight from London - he was amazing, we must have asked him so many questions and he tailored he walk, as he learned more about us. He met us in the Hotel lobby, and made sure we were back safe - talking to others in the hotel, they had not had anything like the experience we did.On our return, we went out with Jessica again for a half day tour - she was equally as informative and fun, it felt like we were out with family. To say she was reassuring was an understatement, we were worried about our airport transfers the next day - and with no hesitation she told us to ring her if we got stuck - what service.We took the advice of the company and booked heir recommended tango show - amazing, value for money, and again better Han others in the hotel had visited, and had been charged a fortune - we were a little nervous of safety, before we arrived - not with our guides, and the tango show pick up and drop off.I would urge you, to use his tour company - faultless!

She is so incredibly knowledgeable about the city - my husband can be a bit of \"history fact junky,\" and Jessica provided him with countless fun historical facts that kept him on his toes all day. Buenos Aires is such a large city, and we really feel like Jessica showed us all of the key sites. She was engaging and personable, and we loved the cafe and lunch spots that she showed us as well. I would not hesitate to recommend Jessica as a tour guide!"

We found our guide, Oliver, an ex-pat, to be personable and informative. He answered our questions but did not seem as engaged as we would have wished--asking no questions of us, for example, about our interests or what we hoped to see and learn about during our visit to Argentina. Upon our return home, I reread a number of the reviews on TripAdvisor, and feel in retrospect that this particular tour itinerary may not have been the best choice--San Telmo and/or Recoleta (which we happily explored later on our own) might have been better. Alternatively, a longer tour might have provided a richer experience. On the 3-hour walking tour of Centro some sites were treated in a very cursory way and we might have gotten more out of a more extended visit (e.g., to the explore the tunnels and do the tour at Manzana de las Luces rather than simply walking in and out of one building). We did spend time in the interior of the cathedral and enjoyed that part of the tour and Oliver's more detailed explanation of particular features of that site. All in all, a good experience--but a bit disappointing given our high expectations."

Our first one was with Oliver touring the Historical City Center and the second one was with Jessica who led us though Ritiro and into Recoleta Cemetery. Both guides were very knowledgeable about Buenos Aires and we covered a lot a ground in the 4 hours. It was interesting to see and hear about Buenos Aires from the perspective of two ex-pats who have lived in the city for some time. It really was similar to having an old friend show us around their adopted city. Our mid tour breaks were perfect and we learned enough from both guides to be comfortable about later navigating on our own. I would highly recommend taking a private walking tour with Buenos Tours. The value for the money was great, the quick response to my questions about the tours before I booked was very helpful, and both tours were a lot a fun."

Oliver really had a good knowledge of history of each area we walked through, and provided both the official and unofficial versions of historical events.

Oliver was an excellent guide, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, informative and helpful. We learned a lot about his adopted city's culture and history in a short time. The pace was perfect for 2 very jet lagged people and we had a perfect coffee stop at Cafe Tortoni. We were really pleased we had booked the tour and Oliver was outstanding.

While he's super-knowledgeable about Buenos Aires' history and architecture, the tour never felt like a list of facts, but rather a series of vignettes with reoccurring characters and themes.We took the full day tour, beginning in La Boca. In one day, we were able to weave our way through San Telmo, Microcentro (downtown), Plaza de Mayo, Retiro, and Recoleta. We went inside famous buildings of all sorts, from churches to government buildings. We had a relaxing coffee break at the famous Cafe Tortoni and a nice empanada and salad lunch in a charming Recoleta restaurant. Our tour finished at the Recoleta Cemetery, where Alan expertly weaved his way through the maze of mausoleums, highlighting the famous (Eva Per\u00f3n) and the not-so-famous-but-interesting (a domestic servant buried just outside her employers' mausoleum). Having done all of these things, I am both surprised and delighted that the tour never felt hurried.As a two year resident of Buenos Aires, I experienced the tour in a different way from other tourists. I didn't really need Alan's accurate translations, and I already had been to most of the locations on the tour. But, for me, it was an eye-opening experience. Anyone can get a map and walk around a city. But to really understand what you are seeing, from the cannon balls embedded in a historical church tower to the graffiti painted the day before by some politically active youth, one needs a guide. Moreover, I now finally understand who all those old men on the Argentine currency are.The private tour format is a huge advantage. During our tour, we saw plenty of other tourists in large groups following lazily behing their guide. The were talking amongst themselves and had little or no connection to the guide. For us it was completely different: an engaging, personal and memorable experience."

I really can't believe how much of the city we were able to see. Quite an accomplishment. If you are worried that a full day may be too strenuous well don't be! They expertly place subway rides on 100 year old wood carts, lunches at famous cafe's, and leisurely walks throughout the tour. My guide also helped tailor the tour to my likes and wants.

Jessica was of great help in locating and describing the most important features and locations there.On a walk like this a guide is a must for two reasons. First, a do it yourself walk with your head in a guidebook wouldn't come near to gaining an understanding of the locale.

He was very helpful and informative, and the tour was very relaxed and pleasant. He was able to easily answer all our questions and make recommendations on what other sights we should see on our short trip here. He gave us great insight into the Recoleta area, and the cemetery tour was so much more valuable with his input. And, we loved the midway stop for gelato!"

After a lot of research we settled on Buenos Tours full day walking tour. What a good choice. Oliver met us at our hotel in the morning for the San Telmo walk then handed us over to Jessica for Recoleta in the afternoon. Both were so nice, easy to talk to and very informative. Whilst there was a lot of walking and we are not exactly young at no stage did we find it difficult. It was a great day and really good value for money - highly recommended."

We wanted to break up our return and get a bit of the city's culture. It had been 12 years since I'd been to BA and had friends with us who had never been there, so we thought the tours was the way to go. They were a real highlight of our overall Argentine experience. Alan and his team do a great job of communicating before you book, after you book and prior to arrival and the tour dates to prepare you so you get everything you possibly can out of the experience. We had four people so it was really cost effective because they were running a special of \"pay for three and the fourth is free\". We did a tour our first two mornings: San Telmo and La Boca one day and Retiro/Recoleta the second with the cemetery being a big highlight. After the first day, we knew how to use the subway and bus system thanks to those being the way we got around for the first tour. Alan lead one and Jessica the other - both excellent tour guides. We also took the company's recommendation for a tango/dinner show and it was excellent. Everything came off without a hitch, we were picked up at our accommodation by private car and taken to the show and returned afterwards as part of the price. Also a real thank you to Isabelle who communicated by email very effectively. Such a pleasure to deal with professional friendly services in a foreign city. They left us with the feeling that if we needed anything while we were there, we could have rang them for advice."

I was worried about my very limited Spanish skills, so I decided to schedule some English-speaking tours to help me get oriented, and bring some structure to my visit. I had over a week in BA, so I decided to do three separate 3-hour tours vs. a single 7-hour tour. This gave me something to do every day and allowed going a bit more in depth with each neighborhood. The tours themselves were great - my guide would meet me at my hotel, and we would then walk, cab, subway or bus our way to the tour route. Midway through, we'd have a break in a notable cafe; we'd rest our feet, have some friendly conversation and a snack, and I'd learn more about the venue and surrounding area. The excursions were excellent for me as a solo traveler, and I think they could be even more fun with one or more additional people.I had two guides; Jessica for two tours, and Oliver for one. They were both very good, and Jessica was truly outstanding. In the end, I got a fantastic introduction to many major landmarks, learned a lot of the city's and nation's history, and also benefited from practical tips on how to use public transportation, make/keep change, etc. There were a couple of places I ended up going back to for more in-depth exploration on my own, and I probably never would've discovered them if relying solely on guidebooks. This was money and time well spent, without a doubt!"

One of the many highlights was a guided tour of the Teatro Colon a magnificent Opera house, being among one of the best in the world with a special & for us a lucky female guide who sang two arias for the tour group - very special indeed. Alan organized the tickets in advance, planned the tour and was extremely pleasant and informative to be with.

This was my first time to B.A but as I only had 2 days there i wanted a tour which was flexible to cover my interests but also ensured I'd get to see all the important attractions. My guide was Jessica a native of NJ who'd been living in B.A for a few years. So it was great as she gave me examples in the US i could relate to and she spoke fluent Spanish. What really made the trip was that Jessica was so well informed about the history and architecture of the city and took me to some off the beaten path places. She also answered all my questions very patiently and really helped me to have a great day out!!"

From the first contact with Alan, owner of Buenos Tours, until the end of our time in Buenos Aires, this was by far the most interesting tour we took there! Learning about the historical development of the city with the many personal stories, drama, myths, and legends gave us a true impression of the Argentine Culture. Digesting the causes of the rise and fall of the area neighborhoods from the working class La Boca situated along the old port to Recoleta, sipping tea at elegant caf\u00e9s, and VIP seating for Tango shows, was just a taste of our some of the experiences we had with Alan. Alan\u2019s knowledge of every inquiry whether architectural or cultural was truly impressive because it is sometimes difficult to portray the past in the present due to dramas or biased interpretations. Leaving us with a lot more knowledge and a sense of mystery combined with English humor made this tour more valuable, interesting, and enjoyable than any other we have taken. Alan\u2019s insider tips and resources for other attractions, events, transportation, and even lodging proved to be invaluable and even his contacts even helped saved us money when booking other activities in the city. Thank you Buenos Tours and Alan for a most memorable and unforgettable experience, one we will not soon forget!"

I booked a tour with Buenos Tours. A major appeal was the fact that my guide, Alan, met me at my hotel to start the day. Once on our way we covered several parts of the city including San Telmo, Monserat, historic city center and Recoleta. Alan was a walking encyclopedia on the history of the city. Being a teacher I loved this part of the tour. Since I was on a 7 hour tour we had a midmorning caf\u00e9 and medialunias and later empanadas for lunch. It was great and both restaurants were classics. The best part is that Alan gave me several handwritten notes for follow up to other places I wanted to see. This was a great way to learn about the city and be familiar enough with it to go exploring on my own."

One could easily be overwhelmed by a city of 13 million people, especially when your native language is not Spanish. After our tour we were comfortably and confidently navigating Buenos Aires with a familiarity that was hard to believe after only one day. Jessica met the three of us in our hotel lobby, on time, and we headed out to learn and enjoy Buenos Aires. We took a taxi to San Telmo and started to learn about the founding of the city, immigration, cultures, economy, wars, politics, religion, architecture and traditions. All of this was done as we walked through fascinating areas, stopping for coffee, drinking Mate, we toured churches, walked cobblestone streets past small brightly painted wooden houses all the way up to massive mansions. We visited Plaza de Mayo where she pointed out and described every significant building and told us about many of the events that had taken place there in the past and explained the protest signs that were there on the day of our tour. We used the Subte (subway) and we were immediately comfortable with its simplicity. We ate at a couple of really good restaurants and we worked our way through many neighborhoods until we toured the amazingly beautiful Recoleta Cemetery where she brought us to many of the most famous tombs of major military and political figures, including Evita\u2019s.  I asked Jessica no less than 100 questions throughout the tour and she had a deep knowledge of every subject. She was born in the US, so she knew what we were likely to find interesting about Buenos Aires. She certainly has a long list of sites to show you, but she also does a great job of listening to your questions to customize the tour to your tastes.  I highly recommend that you take this tour as early as possible on your visit to Buenos Aires; it will enhance the rest of your stay. Wear comfortable shoes because it is a seven hour tour on cobblestone streets and sometimes rough sidewalks."

Jessica was my tour guide (although Alan answered all of my questions via email prior to making the reservation and was very helpful). Jessica was incredibly knowedgeable. She arrived on time at my B&B. She showed me all of the main historical sights in the downtown area, including the Casa Rosada, Plaza de Mayo, Avenida 9 de Julio, etc. She was also able to navigate throught the line to have lunch at Cafe Tortini. Later on we took the Metro to Plaza Dorego and took a walking tour through San Telmo. I love to walk around cities and soak everything in, but doing so in a faraway place can be challenging. I also enjoy a good conversation. But I like to be able to converse with someone who knows the region and history. Jessica met both of these qualities! She helped me to navigate the city and she was very knowlegable. I learned a lot about Buenos Aires from her and I also enjoyed her company. I highly reccommend this tour.

Just came back from Buenos Aires and during our brief stay we did a three hour walking tour of La Boca and San Telmo one day, and a seven hour walking tour of other parts of the city the next day with guides from Buenos Tours. Both guides (Jessica and Alan) were terrific...smart, entertaining, well-informed, knowledgeable. The tours felt like we were visiting the city with local friends rather than a standard tour guide. Both were native English speakers which really enhanced the experience. I felt like I learned more about Buenos Aires in a few hours than in all the reading I had done in advance. Highly recommend this company!"

My husband and I had the extreme pleasure of meeting, Jessica of Buenos Aires Private Walking Tours, our first morning in BA. From the first moment Jessica met us at our rental apartment, we were comfortable, excited and intrigued. As Jessica expertly guided us through the beautiful center of BA, we soon realized that starting our stay in BA with her was invaluable! Jessica has a great sense of humor, is very smart, and has a fabulous knowledge of the history of BA and what's going on now. The 3 hour tour flew by; we didn't want it to be over! Consequently, we booked Jessica for another tour of a different part of the city two days later.......and once again, the tour was phenomenal! If you are visiting BA, this is a must!"

            "review": "Fabulous introduction to a vibrant city!. My husband and I vacationed in Buenos Aires in January 2012. As part of our planning, I went online looking for city tours. I was looking for something private, preferably on foot, which would give us a great overview of the important parts of the city, and touch on various topics (history, architecture, artists, food, city life, pop culture, etc). I found the website for Buenos Tour online after a google search of \"Buenos Aires Walking Tours\".Alan, the business owner and tour manager, responded promptly to me when I emailed to inquire for more info on the trip. After a few email exchanges back and forth, my husband and I settled on the 7 hour walking tour of the city. (This tour would be appropriate for any individual hoping to get a great feel for the layout of the city, and to get a wonderful overview (and answers to specific questions) about Buenos Aires. Don't let the \"7 hour\" length scare you away - it is a very comfortable pace, many opportunities to rest, and many stops where the tour guide will point out interesting things to look at and offer some background information.)We had had the distinct pleasure of spending our first full day in BA doing a 7 hour walking tour with Jessica - a cheerful, young, and extremely knowledgable ex-pat American. She met us at our hotel, and we went off from there. Jessica was friendly, entertaining, and informative - we peppered her with questions all day about politics, culture (historic and pop), food, daily life, you-name-it, and she had intelligent answers for everything. We were very pleased with the tour route - many very interesting stops along the whole way, some at very obvious locations (Pink House, for example, and the Recoleta Cemetary), and some at spots that you would have never come across on your own. Food stops were also great - South American style hot chocolate and medialunas at Cafe Tortoni mid-morning, a great treat and Jessica offerred us many very interesting tidbits about the cafe, its history, and its famous clientelle. Lunch stop was a local restaurant in the Recoleta area - empanadas and provoleta - and a cold beer for the hot day! Recoleta Cemetary was our last stop, and Jessica navigated us through the maze of mausoleums, pointing out various interesting \"residents\" and offering historical information and ghost stories to boot! Should we ever make our way back down, or ever hear of someone who is on their way for a holiday, we will not hesitate to recommend Buenos Tours (and Jessica especially!). We hope Buenos Tours expands into other parts of South America, too - we'd love to have the same opportunity in another one of South America's beautiful cities!"

It was also extremely interesting to get the view point of a US expat living in Buenos Aires long term.

We feel that you can only truly get to know a city on foot...and it was certainly true in this case. To take this tour, you need to be capable of walking several miles. If you can...we highly recommend it as the best way to see Buenos Aires up close and personal."

I've always had good experiences with private tours before so I went with Buenos Tours, which was recommended by a friend, and was very glad I did! I was met at my hotel by Alan, a friendly young man from England who has lived in Buenos Aires for several years. He took me around the city on a three hour tour, answered all of my questions, and gave me an insight into the city that I simply could not have got from guidebooks or group tours. His knowledge was infallible, and he made the tour feel very relaxed and informal. If you want an interesting, friendly tour, without having to worry about other people on the tour, then this is for you."

We both felt that we got to understand the development and growth of the city so much more by spending the day with you than we could ever have wandering about with a guidebook. You brought out the details behind the facts and your extensive knowledge of all those small details in the cities history made everything we saw come alive. The remainder of our visit was certainly enriched by having that head start and we enjoyed the remaining time in BA immensely. Our trip Colonia made for the perfect antidote to the bustle of BA and I can heartily agree on the suggestion to spend a night in the town and enjoy it without the tourists. We are now thinking about a return trip to see the rest of Argentina, (or at least a large swath of it) since it has so much to offer."

After reviewing the options we decided on a personal walking tour with this company.They do various tours but we elected to do the Day Tour. This was a 7 hour private tour and the cost was US $200 - this covered up to 3 people. (US $300 for 4 - 7 people). This is the total for the group and not per person. The tour will be for your party only. They do not mix groups together or add other people. We made payment in advance via PayPal.We were staying at Hotel Madero in the fabulous harbour area full of its new hotels, restaurants, etc. Our guide was Alan who met us at our hotel at 9:30. After brief introductions we set of on our walk - Alan, myself and my wife.We are both fit and good walkers but the pace was not strenuous. The time just flew past and the sights we saw are too many to list. What I can say is that Alan is highly knowledgable and delivers the information in a relaxed manner. He took as to great places such as markets, old buildings, museums, churches, trip on the underground and the most wonderful cemetry. The dead are really very interesting! His knowledge of the city, the people, the history, architecture, etc. is excellent. On our tour we also visited an excellent cafe and a great local restaurant - Alan's recommendations for drinks and food at these places were spot on.At the end of our tour Alan also gave us recommendations for an ice cream shop and a restaurant. We visited both and loved them - can't remember the name if the ice cream shop but it was just along from the red phone boxes on the street corner. The restaurant was La Brigada.As I mentioned the time just flew past and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. Although expensive for 2 people we thought it good value - and much better than sitting on a tour bus! So unless you are on a tight budget I would encourage you to do this tour - and you will never do a bus tour again!"

I think you definetely experience the city in a diferent way once you know a little bit more about it and i think the diference between this tour and the others is that they present the information in a very cool and interesting way leaving out the uncessary and boring parts - awesome.

Buenos Tours was the perfect way to start our 3+ week stay in Buenos Aires. Jessica (our guide) was able to give us a very comprehensive tour of some major parts of the city and we were able to take notes of what we wanted to go back and hit later in our visit, which is very valuable. The tour helped us to get our bearings and feel more comfortable navigating the city (including taxis and the subte) making us feel more confident and excited to head out on our own as our trip progressed. The best parts about Buenos Tours is the size--the walking groups are small and only consist of those people that you sign-up with in your group (in my case, it was just the three of us!). This means that there is plenty of time for questions, photos, customization of the tour, and having longer or shorter stops based on preferences. We were given choices of when to eat (whether we wanted to follow an Argentine or typical United States schedule) and where to eat. It is customization like this and the small group size of the tour that made it truly valuable. Also worth noting is that the tour guide meets you at wherever you are staying in the city, in my case a private residence. This is incredibly helpful and valuable, as this was our first experience getting a Radio Taxi and it was nice to have a seasoned veteran help us out and teach us the cultural tricks. All in all, enough good things cannot be said about Buenos Tours. The tour guide was knowledgeable, friendly, professional, on-time, and very much on-point. The cost was incredibly reasonable, the sights were perfect, and it was the best way for my small group to feel comfortable in the city right off the bat. Our 7-hour tour seemed to pass very quickly because we were all having so much fun, learning a lot, and being so engaged by our tour guide. Highly recommended! It will definitely be remembered as a highlight of my trip to Buenos Aires."

We were traveling with 2 children, ages 12 and 9, and she made sure that the sights we saw were interesting to them as well. She pointed out a 200-year old rubber tree, shared some ghost stories at Recoleta Cemetery, and pointed out red phone booths and mailboxes that marked some of the British contributions to the city. Her love of the city is evident in her deep knowledge of its history. When we return to Buenos Aires (I am sure we will), we will surely call on Buenos Tours again."

My husband and I were promptly met by Alan at our hotel upon arriving from the airport for our 7 plus hour walking tour. I had hired him via TripAdvisor and paid a downpayment of $40 via PayPal. He emailed us a few times and we got to \"know\" him before we left. We were given a terrific tour of the city. Having lived there many years before I knew a little bit and it was obvious to myself and my husband that he really knew his facts and history. He is a wealth of information and has a friendly easy going way about him and seems to be well liked by the cafe and restaurant we visited with him. Since we were staying for over a week, he gave us good security tips and what else to see and do."

Without a shadow of a doubt it was the best use of my vacation dollars ever! Being a bit of a history buff myself, I pumped Alan with obscure question after obscure question. He had answers for all of them. Standing in front of the Pink House and hearing Alan explain how, when and where Peron and Evita spoke to the crowds and how Maradona raised the World Cup from the same balcony sent chills down my spine. I leaned up against a 400 year old wall. I touched San Martin's tomb. I went for latte in a century old coffee shop. I listened to accordian (or whatever they call it) in La Boca just like the immigrants would have at the turn of the century. My sister, who lives in BA and has been on numerous bus tours, learned more about the city in 4 hours than she has in 10 years. Alan was a real gentleman and was full of knowledge and good British humour. DO NOT leave Buenos Aires without going on a tour with Alan or one of his associates. It's worth every penny!

We saw the major sights: the Pink House, Santa Domingo Church, Recoletta Cemetery and much more. It was nice to have an American guide who knows and appreciates her new city.

I was so disappointed!!So, Alan himself said that he could be available for a few hours, he allowed us to do one of their 3 hour tours and add on an hour of our choice!So we ended up doing a 4 hour tour (3 hour city center tour - wow! So informative and interesting! - a quick visit to the San Telmo market, and the Recoleta cemetery)DO NOT go to the Recoleta cemetery without Alan or one of his tour guides!!! You will get lost, and you will not know what you are looking at!!! It is an AMAZING cemetery with so many interesting stories and history to be known!!The tour delivered everything it promised and more! Alan even helped us find a currency exchange that was open on a SUNDAY and gave us directions to all the best ice cream places!!! We felt like we were leaving behind a friend!! Thank you Alan!! There's no way we could have seen so much of Buenos Aires without you!!"

An experience that will transport you back in time. In addition to his knowledge of the city's history Alan shares his personal experiences living in Buenos Aires, cultural nuances and best of all his favorite places to dine! Many tours are canned responses, not with Buenos Aires Tours; Alan and all the guides cater the tour to your interests. With so many activities to experience this is truly one tour that will provide you with the essence of the city. My husband and I travel extensively and have taken many city tours. Alan is terrific! He is passionate about life and history and will make the city come alive."

We booked the 7 hour walking tour with BuenosTours and enjoyed every minute of it. Jessica, our guide, was a young American student who had a clear affection for her adopted city and its history. I've given walking tours myself and you can tell when someone is just reading a script versus sharing their enthusiasm. At the end of the day, we were tired but I had an understanding of the how the city is laid out and its history. It was also fascinating to hear about Jessica's experiences living in BA. We also went to the Piazzolla Tango show recommended by BuenosTours. A tango show might be touristy but I thought this one was excellent. The theater is beautiful. Many styles of tango were danced. The dances were interspersed with songs and it was a very entertaining show."

Buenos Tours\u2019 seven-hour private walking tour of central Buenos Aires was the perfect orientation to the city on our first full day there, not to mention being a completely enjoyable day with our guide (and company founder) Alan, a young Brit full of enthusiasm for the city. Alan not only provided the facts and figures of the key tourist sites, he shared enough of his expat experience in BA that we parted at the end of the day well supplied with recommendations and prepared to dive deep into porte\u00f1o life for the remainder of our holiday. The tour began in San Telmo and worked its way to the Plaza de Mayo and its environs, eventually taking us through Retiro and Recoleta on foot and by subway before concluding with a walk through Recoleta cemetery. Alan\u2019s wide-ranging and impressively deep narration encompassed topics from architecture to history to politics, economics, urban planning, culture, society and more \u2013 all relevant to where we were standing at that moment and placing Buenos Aires in its proper (and highly entertaining) context.Alan displayed sensitivity to our tastes and desires, and as he got to know us over the course of the day his recommendations for activities, places and events dovetailed nicely with what we wanted to learn. These included a peripatetic wine tasting in Palermo (http://www.winetoururbano.com.ar) that provided an excellent introduction both to Argentine wine and to the Palermo Soho neighborhood, a caf\u00e9 in Boedo that gave us the perfect tourist-free porte\u00f1o experience, advice on attending a Boca Juniors football game, and much more. He also taught us how to board a city bus (which is an oddly overcomplicated transaction in BA), and advised us which bus lines would serve our needs.In true Buenos Tours form, as Alan made his goodbye he pointed across the street toward a bar he likes that brews its own beer. And by then we really needed to sit down so it was much appreciated.Thanks, Alan!"

Tennis shoes, water, Camera & money (small change) Get lots of small change. The Subte & busses are so cheap and paid with nickel. Taxis are very affordable. The 7hour tour with Alan was so worth it. We covered alot and there was a lot to hear & see about BA. Tortonis was cool. Alteno Awsomely beautiful. Restuarant c\\o Viamonte & Rodriguez Pena meat was so good. You have to buy 2prs of Tango shoes. Could eat tons of Dulce de Leche! Havanna Alfajor a must. La Defense, Caminito, Recoleta, La Boca, Puerto Madero.Retiro. All a must to see. To walk was safe, keep your valuables close to your body and not in bags with easy accessible pockets. Leather shoes are good buys. Check your change from small side cafes where you buy sweets and cooldrinks. When using a taxi, make sure the car is clean, driver has a name tag hanging on the back seat, use Radio Taxi. If in doudt don't use the driver but most are very good with change and slips. If I had more time I would have definitely done more tours with Alan. The tours are VERY informative with lots of good details. Alan always notified me that he was on his way. Very friendly and polite and I had lots of fun with him. He is very attentive to detail and is punctual with emails. I would certainly recommend Buenos Aires Private Walking Tours as a starting point in BA. You won't regret the time with Alan."

One of our group had arranged this before hand and it was a great way to spend the day. We were met at the terminal and our luggage and us were all transported in a comfortable van. There were seven of us of varying ages and Liz gave us a very good tour of the city in the time available. We had lunch in a cafe where we could see the Tango being performed, learned more about Evita and learned about the culture of the place.We were taken to the airport at the end of the day, not having to worry about our luggage while we were sightseeing. A excellent and very affordable trip with a good driver and a knowledgeable guide."

The group was primarily retired firemen and their wives. Prior to starting the tour that morning Liz briefly met with our group to get a sense of the persons involved so she could customize the tour in a way she felt would provide the most enjoyable experience possible. In our case, she was able to include a visit to a fire station so that the retired firemen could meet some of the local ones, look around the fire station and check out their firefighting equipment. In addition, because of the group's hobby was rebuilding vintage cars she pointed out some places that those that were interested could visit on their own that included memorabilia of former race drivers. That is the kind of personalized service that Liz provides that I had not experienced with tour guides in other locales."

Liz explained the history and significance of these places in an overall context. For our day's visit there were protests to be held later in the evening. We asked her to frame the relationship of these current affairs into the legacy of the people, of these buildings, and institutions.

I found many excellent reviews of Liz on Tripadvisor, and contacted her by email.

That way she was able to customize the tour based on what we were interested in seeing.Liz has wonderful knowledge of the history of Argentina and Buenos Aires, and also a great understanding of the economy and the problems facing the country.While walking in La Boca, we stopped for lunch and ate outside at a restaurant that featured tango dancers and entertainment. My wife and had had empanadas, which were delicious.We had one person on the tour who wanted to dominate the conversation and at times was more interested in talking about himself than listening to Liz. Liz did an excellent job handling the situation so that we were able to get the most out of the tour and her narration.I highly recommend Liz for one or more days of touring in Buenos Aires and the surrounding area."

Make sure to try to get off early if your on a cruise ship the port was difficult to get off the boat being a container port. We saw everything we wanted to see except for the Tortoni cafe due to a protest in the area. "

We travelled as a family of 8 (grandparents, grandkids 8 & 5, parents, and aunt & uncle). We visited the Recoleta Cemetery, La Boca, Puerto Madera, and San Telmo. We had lunch at a small restaurant Liz recommended and we enjoyed the tango dancing. We experienced a good amount of Buenos Aires in only one day with Liz's expert sight-seeing guidance. We highly recommend Liz!"

We were impressed with and appreciative of her detailed historical references as she took us to Recoleta Cemetery, La Boca, Puerto Madera, and San Telmo. I wish we had been able to book her for additional tours (her tours of the monuments in the city and of the Tigre River sound great), but with our disparate interests and the Christmas holiday, we had to settle with only one day of Liz's expert sight-seeing guidance. We had lunch in La Boca at a small restaurant Liz recommended and were especially thrilled when Liz was invited to participate in the tango dancing being performed. Even without the right shoes, and dancing with an unfamiliar partner, Liz's skill and charm were exquisite! My husband and I intend to return to B.A., and we will again secure Liz's services for additional insightful excursions in the city. Thank you, Liz, for a wonderful, fun, and educational day!"

Buenos Aires is very big and has many sites to see. Liz arranged a private driver for myself and my husband, as well as for another traveler. We had a semi-private tour, and Liz was able to give a sample of all the different areas of BA. I would suggest that if you really want to spend a lot of time in one area to organize this with Liz because what she can provide from 10 - 5 is really only a taste, but for first timers this is perfect. I feel like we covered a lot of ground and had a good idea of what BA had to offer. This would be good to plan in the beginning of your trip, so that you can return to areas that you find more interesting than others. Liz was informative and has knowledge of the city and its history. Thank you Liz for a nice experience."

This was a special day for Argentinians, the Election Day and a rugby match of Argentina vs Australia at Rugby World Cup. And I greatly appreciate Andrea spent a large amount of the day with me. It was like being with a very knowledgeable friend. We visited several parts of the city including Plaza de Mayo, La Boca, Recoleta, and Palermo and finished the tour at the street market in San Telmo. Andrea is an excellent guide, and visiting all these places without her would not be the same. Behind her impressive knowledge of history, are life stories of Argentinian people in different periods of time, the stories of revolution and dictatorship, the stories of rich and poor, and very poor, which really touch you\u2026. While watching rugby during lunch, Andrea told me that national sport is still football; however Argentina is not performing so well recent years. I also learned about food, and about tango and what it means for Argentinian people. Andrea booked for me the nice little place where I next day enjoyed Tango show and learned basic steps of the dance (was really fun). She also advised me things to do next day such as guided tour of Teatro Colon, that really is impressive and I could only wish to see performance there. Overall, day spent with Andrea was fantastic, and I would highly recommend her, she really personalize the tour and I could not imagine somebody would not enjoy it."

Liz Andrea is bright, humorous and fun to be with and takes each visitor into account as she plans her tour days. She is well connected and familiar with all parts of the city as well as the nearby areas of Tigre and Colonia. We chose to focus on the city itself. We visited the Recoleta, Retiro, Centro, and Bocca areas with Liz Andrea. My wife wished to have a leather jacket made while in Buenos Aires and Liz Andrea was of great assistance in the accomplishment of the mission. She also arranged a fabulous dinner and Tango show night for us. Liz Andrea also suggested locations for more in depth visits during the rest of our stay in the city including the Colon Theatre. Walking the streets of a great city is the only way to get to truly get the feel of it.

Since neither one of us speaks Spanish well, and because there is so much to see in BA, I decided to book a private tour for us and our friends who came with us. I felt like the tour would help orient us to the city, and give us some ideas for things we\u2019d like to do or go see on our own.We\u2019ve done lots of tours in large groups before (particularly on cruises), but I never find those very satisfying. You are rushing from place to place, and things are usually geared towards the lowest-common denominator (someone who has absolutely no knowledge of the country they\u2019re visiting, and who isn\u2019t very mobile). The private tours we\u2019ve done have been good, because the tour guide can usually modify her or his timing and itinerary and customize it. The tour with Liz definitely met that expectation.My husband and I booked the tour for the Friday morning that we landed in BA. Our flight got in at about 6am, and we originally scheduled the tour to start at 10am. I got nervous about possible delays through customs or from the airport, though, and Liz said she was able to adjust to 10:30 with no problem. I shouldn\u2019t have worried - we were able to get to our hotel in the Palermo district with plenty of time to spare. Our friends had arrived the day before, so we were all ready to go by the time Liz showed up.When scheduling the tour, Liz had said that we would be too big a group to rent a car - we could take taxis or else hire a driver and van. We opted for the driver and van; the up charge wasn\u2019t bad at all. When the \u201cvan\u201d showed up, though, we were really surprised. It was actually a mini-bus. It was a little comical for the 5 of us to pile in and out of it throughout the day, but Liz said that it was cheaper to do it that way than to rent a mini-van. The driver was good and the van was comfortable.We started at Recoleta Cemetery, and learned some of the history of the place from Liz. I have been to famous cemeteries in Paris, New Orleans, and other cities - this one definitely belongs near the top of the list for great world cemeteries. She told us interesting stories about some of the notable mausoleums and monuments, and of course showed us where Evita is buried. Afterwards, we walked through the Recoleta district, checking out old mansions that have been converted to hotels and embassies. It really felt like we could have been in a European Capital.From Recoleta, we drove through the new Puerto Madero district, and through el Centro. She pointed out Florida Street as the best place to change US Dollars, and then we made a stop in the La Boca neighborhood. This was definitely a rougher neighborhood than Recoleta, but still beautiful. We walked around admiring the ad-hoc architecture, and Liz took us to a place that changed some of our money (not at as good of a rate as we eventually got on Florida ST, but better than the official rate). We ate at a little courtyard restaurant that was off-the-beaten path from all the tango restaurants in La Boca. The food was good, though, and we definitely felt like we were in another country.After lunch, we went to El Centro and walked around there for a while. We saw the outside of the Pink House, and ended the tour in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral (where Pope Francis served as arch bishop before moving to Rome). As we were wrapping up, Liz arranged for the friends we were traveling with to see a tango show later that night. My husband and I were wiped out after the day of travel and touring, so we opted out of that. The tour was great - I feel like we were lucky to have found someone as passionate and knowledgeable about her country as Liz. I also appreciated her \u201cgo with the flow\u201d approach, as she tailored the tour to the things we wanted to see and were most interested in. I highly recommend a personal tour with Liz if you happen to be traveling to Buenos Aires for some sight-seeing."

Starting at the cemetery where Evita Perron is burried and many other historical figures and moving on to the very nice historical \"Palaces\" and buildings now occupied by foreign embassies and major hotels . As a big contrast to this area we moved on in a couple of cabs to the colourful La Boca area where , and it pays to have a good connection like Liz , we got great seats at a \"tango\" Restaurant where we enjoyed some nice local food and enjoyed the dancers including Liz . After lunch we walked some more through this fun part of the city before we went to the major downtown square to go into the Pink Palace where Evita had given her famous speech . We all had a great day and felt richer by all these wonderful experiences and the great tour that Liz had given us . For that we can really recommend booking with Liz . She also helped us make up our mind of which Tango Show we should book , Gala Tango ! And she was right on that also , it was the best show we could have wished to see.! Thanks Liz for a great day !"

            "review": "An excellent guide choice for your tour of BA!. We \"found\" Liz by researching reviews here on TA and, as expected, the reviews were right! Liz is a native-born Argentinean and immensely knowledgeable about her home country. Our 6-hr tour of the city began with a short (45-min) overview of the history of Argentina and it's \"ups-and-downs\"...including a good introduction to the current social/political issues of today. Based on our preferences we had arranged prior to our arrival, Liz showed us both historical and cultural sites around the central part of the city (the major cemetery, churches, museums, important buildings and other landmarks) before traveling out to the La Boca area for a sidewalk lunch at a \"tango\" restaurant and viewing the \"artsy\" side streets of this neighborhood. Other neighborhoods were visited before ending our tour back in city center. Liz does not have personal transportation (car, van, etc.), but relies on public transportation for movement about the city. Although initially seen as a negative, using local taxis/buses allows for a better expenditure of your time (Liz isn't hampered with trying to drive/park/etc.). And, in reality, it's another opportunity to experience the BA lifestyle.If you're looking for a custom tour of BA, you will be more than satisfied with Liz for your needs. Be sure to book well in advance in order to communicate exactly your expectations about what to do, where to go and what to see. You won't be disappointed.

We spent a day and a half with her and were delighted. She also gave us good recommendations on other things to do outside of our touring time with her. Her spoken English is easy to understand and we were comfortable throughout the tour. We went to Recoleta and a number of other neighborhoods in BA. They were all more fascinating because of the information about the people involved in building them."

Liz is experienced,insightful and passionate about her city. She conveys this to her clients and tours at your pace.

Liz was far more than a tour guide, she was the travel agent, personal manager, body guard, political commentary, historian, an honest good person, and someone you would feel safe in leaving your children with. She started us off with a history lesson so we could understand how Buenos Aires, and Argentina have evolved. That put in framework the things that we saw. She took us to places where the locals go, where the tourists go and to where ever you wanted to go. She was flexible with changes in weather, personal needs to exchange money, or our personal desires. It was truly a great trip. We wanted more and she gave us boats on the Triger, Soccer stadiums, Gauchos and Estancia, and yes we learned how to conduct, equip for, and ride in a polo game. Liz is highly responsive. She will always respond to you within 24 hours. She makes things happen that we did not believe could be scheduled at the last minute. Thank you again Liz...you are great."

She actually helped me book a FANTASTIC tango show and dinner the night before, a night I will never forget. The service and food were top notch, and it comes recommended by Liz as she goes to these herself to ensure the highest quality. I also ended up getting a discount as she reserved in local pesos, rather than doing it from abroad. Liz showed up the next morning at 10, asked me a bit about what I was interested in, and soon we delved deep into the political, economic, and cultural history of Argentina. She set up the tour beautifully, she is extremely knowledgeable and adapt the tour to your interests and previous expectations. In a nutshell, we hit Recoleta, Boca, Puerto Madero, and the pink house, while having lunch in Boca watching tango. All along the way Liz gave insightful and entertaining stories that looped back to our initial history lesson, and also gave her own perspective as a Argentinean growing up in BA. She is delightful, insightful, and easy to get along with, and was well worth the time and money. I would HIGHLY recommend Liz to anyone who wants a personalized tour of BA with an amiable and fun tour guide. Thanks Liz!"

She started off by meeting us in the lobby of our hotel and giving us a brief description of the history of the city and the sites we were planning on visiting that day. Starting off with this overall brief really helped to put things into perspective when we were touring. Besides having a wealth of knowledge about BA's history, Liz is also well informed both economically and politically. It was really great to be able to converse with someone who understands the factors that play into these facets of the city. She isn't your typical tour guide regurgitating from a memorized script, she is an insightful and intelligent guide who is clearly passionate about her city and wants to share all of its brilliance as well as some of its darker sides with you. Admittedly, I'm not someone who typically enjoys tours because I'd rather read the script someone is going to feed me rather than pay to be read to. This was nothing like that and I'm very glad that my girlfriend booked Liz because I learned so much more than I would have ever thought. Not only did I learn a lot but I had a lot of fun! Liz is very sociable and incredibly charismatic that you can't help but adore her. She explains things in such a manner that what could be a boring history lesson from one person is a fascinating and interesting story from Liz. It was like spending the day with a friend showing us around the city. Although we were only spending one day with her, Liz also gave us suggestions on what else to do during the rest of our stay based on our interests. I would not hesitate to recommend Liz to any of my friends visiting BA and the next time we visit the city, I would absolutely hire Liz again for one of her other tours. Thanks Liz!"

She is very well versed in her country\u2019s history and does an outstanding job explaining the key points to you. We then proceeded on our tour and at each stop Liz explained how the site related to Argentina\u2019s history. Having that summary before the tour really helped you to put the pieces together.

And I was able to get some great photos of the dancers.After having Liz Flores as our guide we felt like we had a \"local friend' show us her city...I would highly recommend Liz Flores as a guide."

Liz showed me around years ago for a half day on each of three days, and I sent my sister to her late last year. I went again last month with my new girlfriend, and Liz took us to spots I hadn't visited before. Buenos Aires is a huge city, but she knows it well and knows a lot of details about the history. She also introduced us to great restaurants and gave us ideas of what to do when we spent time on our own, and she also steered us away from areas where we might have had problems. Great city. Great guide."

She came to our hotel to meet us, had coffee with us and provided some history and background on BA. We had a lot of fun with her and she took us to all the highlights and recommended many other things to go back to, based on our interests. She gives great insight into the vibe of the city and is very proud of her country. Liz was the highlight to the start of our trip, and the introduction to this big city with so much to see and do.

The tour is great as you can decide if you like a place enough that you want to return on your own to explore some more. It also gives you an idea of how big the city is. Liz also arranged a tango show/dinner which was pretty good. All in all it was a great day and we ended up returning to a lot of the places on the tour again on our own. So if you are headed to Bs.As contact Liz and she will show you her city for which she has a passion."

She met us at our hotel in Recoleta and we spent about an hour learning about the history and politics of Argentina from the Spanish conquest forward. She is facile in explaining the complex and tempestuous history of the culture and politics of this nation which are difficult to sort out for the visitor--even those interested in geopolitics. She was senstive to what we wanted to see and was very careful not to divulge her own politcal leanings until she understood our perspectives. Her family has been in Argentine for at least three generations, so she has experienced first hand or through her parents or grandparents' memories much of the last 75 years of tumult in this country. They came as hard-working immigrants (like almost all Argentines). She is a good teacher and gave us erudite explanations of all we saw, in an historical/political context, from the Recoleta cemetary, to the metropolitan cathedral, to the protestor in front of the \"red house\". It was a pleasure to hear her interpretation of ancient events as well as more recent gossip about Papa Francis and President Cristina Fernandez Krishner. An juicy and possibly true stories about the corpse of Eva Peron. We went to lunch in La Boca at a not very good restaurant, and enjoyed this part of the city the least. (Might want to skip this colorful, but touristy part of BA.) Liz is expensive, but we felt she provided good value. We were quoted a price of 100.00 a head and paid that even though we went from two to four clients. She is an Afficianado of the Tango and participates herself frequently, She referred us to Gala Tango with tango lession, dinner and excellent show. We enjoyed it--frist rate muscians and dancers. Know what you want to see and she will be better able to tailor your day's outing. We started at 10AM and finshed at 5PM.SInce in my opinion tourism at its best introduces us not just to sights but also to culture and different ways of perceiving and living the human experience, I think Liz is excellent and I can recommend her easily and gladly. I would use her again if I returned to this interesting, complicated culture of Tango and the Disapeared; of and Francis and Cristina."

We stopped in the middle for lunch and coffee. So we enjoyed the touristic parts and also the local atmosphere.Liz is a really expert woman."

I went into NYTimesTravel and found great comments about Liz so I hired her. She is a lovely person and knows a lot about Buenos Aires life during day and nights. I stayed 4 days at least and she organized all things to do (touristics and not touristics) so I went into the local culture and learn a lot about Argentina with her.She also recommended an Hotel as soon as I contact her and that was a good suggestion. I stayed at a nice one, not expensive and at a good location. But she has bee working with many and will tell you the truth between your choices. You can find a long list at her site www.lizflor2.blogspot.com where she wrote about \" accomodations\".I highly suggest you to do a tour with her. She is so puntual, has everything in mind and all the connections in the city to make your day easy.I spent long hours during day and 2 eve nights enjoying the Tango . Really good!"

As other reviewers have said, her knowledge of history, politics, and culture of Argentina is encyclopedic and provided an excellent framework for our short visit. She knows the \u201cins and outs\u201d for getting around town. There were four people in our group, and Liz was flexible enough to handle some changes in her original plans in order to accommodate us. She also had to make some revisions based on the unusually cold weather (by local standards) that we had during our stay in BA \u2013 we can confirm that Liz knows the best places to get hot chocolate! We were lucky because the big agriculture show was underway, and that was especially interesting \u2013 of course we would never have known about it on our own. I think that when you leave a place and the guide has made you want to come back, the guide has done a good job. Liz made sure we would all have good memories of Buenos Aires and a desire to return there to see and learn more. The only thing I would suggest is that if there are going to be 4 or more people in your party, think about working with Liz ahead of time to arrange a driver with a car big enough for everyone. We split up into two cabs, which worked pretty well, but it would have been more fun if we\u2019d all been together. I just didn\u2019t think of that while I was making BA arrangements."

I've been to BA 20 times or so on business, but when I would read travel articles, I knew there was so much more to see than just the small area (office, hotel, restaurants, and park) that I know so well. I wanted to explore something new and take my wife along on this trip, but my wife insisted that we hire a local guide to make sure we would see the great spots. My wife was right, and Liz was the right guide for us. She really took good care of us and helped to \"economize\" our time so that we saw the best in just a few days. -- Liz even helped us plan our own trip to Tigre (delta). It was a great side trip, but my wife and I agreed that we probably should have hired Liz to go with us for the day."

First Liz has a wonderful command of the English language. She is passionate about her country and wanted to show us the ins and outs, politics, economic and the history of BA and Argentina.Previous to us arriving in Argentina, Liz asked what we were interested in and then planned our trip around our interests.She arrived at our hotel on time and proceeded to lay out the history of Argentina from past to present. Which was very interesting for sure. We would have two days with Liz and quite possibly could have used a third.We headed out after about an hour and jumped into a taxi and off we went. City tour, walking tour, tango dancing in Boca(which was simply amazing, especially the 8 year old gaucho dancing), all very authentic for sure. Liz is a tango dancer as well but was injured when we were there, would have loved to see her dance, she was so passionate about it! Would have loved to have gone to a local milonga and dance. Cemetery in Recoleta where Evita was buried. Local spots, shops, fairs. We went to TIgre Delta another day, on the coast train and river boat. Beautiful country. Liz was a great choice, and I will tell everyone who will listen, you must book her. Wonderful tour guide."

We love to walk around and don\u00b4t get crowded tours with fixed schedules. We love to feel free. So we found Liz at this site and we hire her for 2 days and 2 eve nights. In 2 days we learn a lot about Argentina and its people and of course TANGO ! She prepared a plan for us according to our interests. We stopped for a coffee and lunch. We visited all the Evita History and all the Tango Life. We enjoy Buenos Aires a lot! Tks Liz! You can visit her at www.lizflor2.blogspot.com to see this or other options and her profile. Good choice for us!"

Puesto Viejo has it all.Set on the beautiful countryside near Ca\u00f1uelas, you will be taken to not just a single polo field facilitation to play, but a beautiful (not to mention huge) renowned polo club. After arriving, some coffee/tea and a tour, the day starts off with practising your swings on a stool. Not long after you will be practising your swings on very well trained horses under the guidance of Julio. After training follows a delicious lunch and a small polo match to bring into practise what you have learned earlier. Having been active in western competitions, I found Julio truly one of the most pleasant and capable trainers I have ever encountered. His great enthusiasm, experience, humour and ability to adapt to any rider makes him a outstanding trainer. Besides seriously wanting to improve, once I had to make sure I didn't laugh my way any further off the saddle because of his hilarious narration of our polo game.During your activities you will see other polo players at work as well, next to stable employees who seem to take wonderful care of the many horses that are present. Having been wanting to try out polo for a long time, my day at Puesto Viejo had long exceeded expectations and definitely made me fall in love with the sport. I will be looking for possibilities to continue back home. Thanks to Puesto Viejo for the wonderful hospitality and the great day! I will come back for sure.Emma"

So, it is a not a polo filed on a backyard of a ranch.The drive picked us up at our hotel in Buenos Aires, then we drove for about an hour, could be less if there was no traffic. We are a couple with some riding experience, but there were two brothers with us without any experience. First we had a short tour, then we practiced different swings standing on stools. After we managed to hit the ball consistently we picked up helmets and jumped on horses. VERY WELL TRAINED horses. We rode many horses in the past and can tell you these were well trained horses with perfect mind. No running, no bucking, no other misbehavior. In the first lesson we just tried to hit the ball on our own, not playing yet. Not easy, but that is what makes it fun.Then we had a lunch with a glass of wine. After lunch we had a game! We were surprised how well the two brothers did considering that they jumped on horses first time in their lives. Was fun! Again the horses did perfect job, no spooking, obeying commands. we were running into each other and they were doing their job.After the game we watch a real game by two teams. Overall I think I am hooked on polo, need to check out polo clubs in Toronto. We may also come back for a polo holiday. The Puesto Viejo has a hotel and you can stay therre. Sort of like a skiing or diving vacation, but this time it is polo vacation."

Our instructor Julio was fantastic - spoke fluent English, had a wonderful sense of humor and was very patient and kind. His friendly and positive personality made the whole day so much FUN!! Day begins with a tour of the horse stables, and then learning the basics of polo - how to swing, etc. Then there is a fabulous three course lunch. It was home-cooked, delicious, and the staff were wonderful in catering to my husband's request for gluten free. Hour break for lunch to relax and explore the grounds, and then we had a match! We were all beginners, though our competitive nature must have taken hold because we were all pretty decent when it came to to compete against each other. Must have been Julio's excellent instructing!! We actually booked accommodation and stayed overnight after everyone went home at the end of the day. Highly recommend doing it that way. The property is gorgeous and there is so much more to explore. Top notch experience - you'll love it even if you're a beginner. Can't wait to head back to Argentina for another polo day."

Julio made the experience really enjoyable for me and I'd highly recommend it to anyone. I was then served a lovely lunch and was greeted by Jeremy himself who was very good company.

Horse welfare was a high priority for us when selecting a polo day to attend, all the boxes were ticked here! This was our first polo experience, we enjoyed learning the swings before getting on the horses. The horses are exceptionally well trained. Quiet and safe enough for complete beginners or the most nervous riders to learn on, and then could go out in the afternoon and play a game of polo at professional level. Our lunch was delicious and we enjoyed watching a game from the shelter of Julio's car (it was a particularly cold day). Our own polo match in the afternoon was a lot of fun, and we were very grateful to Julio for taking our camera out with us and getting a lot of nice photos to remember the experience.

We had originally planned on doing the Polo Day & Stay, in which you are picked up in BA, go to the estate, have two lessons, lunch / dinner, and are taken back to BA the following morning. We ended up extending into the next day as much as our existing flight plans would allow, so that we could take more lessons.Our trainer was Julio, who is one of the most charismatic people I've ever met. As a teacher, he was also incredibly patient and helpful. My girlfriend and I had been on horses several times in the past, but polo is a different experience altogether. We had a lesson off-horse our first morning to get accustomed to the ball and stick, and then after lunch got on the horses for some horsemanship and to practice our swings from the saddle. The owner's wife joined us on the practice field for a pick-up guys vs. girls game, in which the two professionals were very good at trying to develop us without completely exposing our utter lack of skills!We also had the opportunity that to observe a long weekend tournament that was being played at the estate, and Julio and one of the hotel guests played on a team together. At the professional level, polo is exhilarating and very intimidating to watch.The grounds of the estate are very beautiful and, though it was cresting into fall when we were there (e.g. the pool was open but too chilly), it would be a delightful place to spend summers as well. We biked around the grounds during some of our free time.I would encourage people to not just come for the Polo Day, but instead stick around for the charming boutique hotel on the grounds of the estate. It's very small and intimate - perhaps 10 or 15 rooms - and everyone congregates together in the main houses for meals, happy hour, and conversation. The owner was around for several of these occasions as well, which was a nice gesture. Most of the people staying there are real polo players from around the world who have come to Puesto Viejo for a number of weeks, thus you can find yourself in over your head at the dinner table when everyone else is talking the minutiae of the sport. Though we had nothing to contribute there, it was still an interesting experience learning about everyone's background and how they came to be polo players.Overall, a great spot. I think by nature of booking a short-term stay and then extending it, we probably did Puesto Viejo as expensively (on a per-day basis, of course) as we could have possible done. I would definitely return but perhaps dedicate more time so that I could better develop my riding and stick & ball skills."

After doing some research we found Puesto Viejo and decided to give it a try. Our driver picked us up from our hotel in Recoleta. After an hour we arrived at the estancia, a gorgeous place with stunning views of the countryside. We were greeted by Julio, an excellent polo instructor who provided an in-depth tutorial on swings and tactics. We had very little experience riding horses and he was very patient and professional (lesson was taught in English!). The horses they picked for us matched perfectly our skill level. Food was delicious, traditional cuts of Argentine meat, malbec wine, empanadas and dessert (try the homemade flan with dulce de leche). After relaxing a bit after lunch we took a nice bicycle ride to the stables for the second part of the instruction where we ended up playing a hilarious mini match with the other guests. A well-deserved tea/coffee with assorted cakes and pastries was waiting for us after the match, while we enjoyed watching the club members play a professional polo match. Around 5.30 we were taken back to our hotel by the same friendly driver. This is a must do experience if you want to try something different. I highly recommend Puesto Viejo."

We were picked up at our hotel in Palermo by a very friendly driver Freddy. We were whisked off to the countryside an hour away from BA to a beautiful Polo Farm and greeted by our Polo Instructor Julio with desserts and refreshments. We took a short bicycle ride to the stables where Julio first instructed us on usage of the Polo Mallets and the different swings we would use on the horse. Then we saddled up on the clean mild mannered horses that were very easy to control and had a practice lesson for about a hour on the horses. As we were the only couple enjoying the polo day on that day in April 2016 we had a private lesson with Julio. Julio was very knowledgable, patient, professional, and friendly. After our lesson, we had a nice steak lunch at the house. In the afternoon, we enjoyed a polo match/game against a father/daughter team that were staying at the ranch. Julio was the ringer for our team so we miraculously won by 1 point. There was a infinity pool amenity that was lovely that we would have used had the weather been warmer. After our match Freddy drove us back to BA city. As a parting memento Julio gifted us with a horseshoe, and later on emailed us all the professional pictures that were take of the match that day. This was the highlight of our trip to BA and we would recommend it to everyone and anyone who is even mildly interested in polo and or horses!

We got back onto the ponies and started a game of our own with Julio! He and our seven year-old son took on my 11 year-old daughter, hubby and myself. It was great fun. Our ponies were slow (in a good, safe way) and knew how to play the game better than we did! Lots of laughs, smiles and memory making.

We did the free walking tour, a bicycle tour, the Colonia day in Uruguay and spent a day with Julio and his Polo Ponies. Neither of us has much riding experience and I am 50+ (sorry can't tell you my wife's age!). We were picked up by Frederico at our hotel in Recoleta and after a quick stop to pick up another couple, we drove into the Argentinian countryside. Frederico is learning english and was very helpful in giving us a bit of a tour as we drove through town. The Polo Club/Ranch was very picturesque and well kept. The atmosphere was relaxed and gracious. we had a coffee and treats before heading on a tour of the stables. We used plastic stools to learn how to use our mallets and hit both forwards and backwards. We then had to use this newly learned skill on horseback... Julio was an excellent teacher and very encouraging. The horses were gentle and certainly knew how to play much better than we did!We had a wonderful lunch with lots of choice. We sat outside under a vine covered pergola... very Tuscan and relaxing. Then to get prepare for the big match, we had a lovely swim in the infinity pool overlooking the Polo fields. We played a 4 on 4 match in a half field configuration - Loads of fun and excitement. It was very challenging to hit the ball while others are trying to stop you. Next we watched the real Polo players from the club play. They sure moved a lot faster than we did. It was a great day and certainly our highlight from the time in BA... you don't get the chance to learn and play Polo in a fun and safe environment very often. We are so glad we decided to do this!"

Whether you are a total novice who has never considered riding or an experienced rider who fancies trying a bit of polo, it's a must do. This was my tactic to persuade my boyfriend to give it a go.... And it worked! Puesto Viejo is an incredible place and we had a great day. My boyfriend was given the perfect horse who didn't really like to go faster than walk and I had something a bit more speedy. He still can't believe he has played polo and after watching the boys play some friendly matches up on the beautiful club pitches, he can't wait to try it again. It really is quite addictive! The grounds of Puesto Viejo are beyond beautiful with so many different trees, myriad birds from hummingbirds and Falcons to burrowing owls, a modern looking clubhouse and maybe 5/6 perfectly cultivated pitches. All the people who work at PV were delightful and super friendly, helping us out whenever they could and providing us with a yummy lunch. If you're considering a polo day or even a polo holiday, this is the place to do it. It's got such a great vibe, I couldn't recommend it more. Thanks for making us feel like part of the club PV, we hope to come back again someday!"

Both of us had sat on a horse maybe a few times before, last time 10 years ago. We were a bit hesitant and wondered if we'd really get to play a chukka in the end. But yes, we did and it was so much fun!!The day started with a welcome coffee and pastries at the main building. We were greeted by the team by name as soon as we arrived - what a heartfelt welcome, we loved it!Our polo instructor julio joined us there and soon we were headed out for a quick visit of the estate. We then first did some exercises (without the horse) to learn different swings and also refreshend our memory on how to manouver the horse. Once we had the basics, we got on the horses and headed out to the field to apply what we had just learned. To our surprise, we actually managed to hit the ball and stay on the horse. We had such a great time and the horses were patient with our polo intents, we felt safe at all times. Our instructor julio would join us and give us advice as we hit the ball across the field - we had such a blast and learned quickly, thanks to precise corrections and continious encouragement from julio. We then headed back to the main house for a very delicious lunch, before heading out in the afternoon to actually play a three against three polo!! Liliana (the owner), her daugther victoria and her friend joined us for a game! They made sure to challenge us but also let us play at our own rythm. We scored a few points and had so much fun, we sure laughed a lot! Thank you for that experience!!Our instructor julio was with us throughout the whole day and also joined us for lunch. He was very kind, funny and made sure that we had an amazing time!This polo experience remains a highlight of our 6 week vacation through south america and we strongly recommend it to everyone!!!! Thank you Puesto Viejo - it was awesome!!"

Came in after an hour or so for lunch. Very premium spread for lunch (tempura cheese appetizers, asado with mashed potatoes, full rack of desserts. Wine and drinks). Given some time to explore the grounds after lunch then got back on the horses for an afternoon match. Our instructor was Hulio who was a beauty but all the staff were very friendly.

We were a group of four and two of the group had only been on a horse once. Puesto Viejo arranged our transportation to their estancia. Julio and his team did all they could to make our group comfortable. We arrived to a light snack and then had a tour of the stables. After that, we moved right into a lesson. We began by donning our helmets and then, standing on a crate, we practiced hitting the ball with the polo stick/mallet. After several swing attempts and a many horse-riding tips, Julio selected a horse for each us, based on our riding experience. For the new riders, Julio selected very gentle horses that were happy to just walk their way around the field. Puesto Viejo has horses to meet every riders' level. Julio made sure that everyone got a chance to hit their ball up and down the field several times. After the first lesson we returned to the hotel and had a hearty lunch, where Julio continued to answer questions so we could better understand the game and the polo way of life. After lunch we relaxed for about 45 minutes by the pool - then it was time for our second lesson and a 'game.' Those who were nervous at first, quickly found trust in Julio and the horses. After our second time in the saddle, we got to watch a game played by professional. Lots of great action. By the end of the day, we were tired and completely content, just in time for their driver to take us back to the city. We can't recommend this activity enough. It makes for a great adventure to tell friends and family about back home."

I didn't even know what I should expect; however, it was by far the best experience I had while on vacation! I will always remember that day. They picked us up in Buenos Aires drove us to the ranch (and drove us home), gave us a tour, and immediately started to teach us how to ride horses and play polo. Our instructor was welcoming, patient, personable, and funny. Although he was all those things he was also experienced and taught us so much about polo. We had a delicious meal for lunch then spent the afternoon actually playing polo. To this day, it is crazy to me that I can now say, I actually played polo. The horses were easy going and Puesto Viejo did provide me with a helmet to wear. By the end of the day, my brother and I were having so much fun, we didn't want to leave. This is an opportunity of a lifetime, day events like this are hard to come by in the U.S. and in some cases/places polo isn't that accessible as a sport so I was really thankful I had this opportunity. I do want to travel again to Argentina and if/when I do, I would love to go back to Puesto Viejo. Tips- it's a ranch people- make sure you do NOT wear fancy shoes. Come with an open mind and trust your instructor. The ranch/estate is a legitimate polo club so they know what they are doing!"

Julio was patient and accommodating and made me feel comfortable. Great attention to detail on site. Highly recommended!"

Hard to choose between this and the Boca Jr. futbol game I attended but I think this wins for the highlight of Buenos Aires events. From pick up to drop off (9am-7pm) everything went like clock work- flawless. First class treatment all the way! After about an hour drive from Buenos Aires by mini-van, once we arrived we were treated to coffee/tea and pastries, then a tour of the stables with an explanation of what we were seeing, as well as some of the nuances of Polo and what is involved in maintaining your horse. We were then taken to an area and taught how to swing the mallet properly. The grounds are beautiful and expansive, impeccably maintained. After that we kitted up with helmets and leg protectors and mounted out horses. I have ridden many \"stable\" horses (not polo) in the past but these were the best trained and reasonably co-operative horses that I have ever been on. We ran through the basics of turning and stopping, then we practiced hitting the ball up and down a polo field. Afterwards, an amazing multi-course lunch featuring BBQ meat, salad, emenadas, tinto vino, and a tasty dessert. Really delicious food. After lunch, we watched the local pros put on an exhibition match for us, so we could see how it's done. Then, it was out turn. We kitted back up and spilt into teams and played a hilarious game of polo. So much fun! I was laughing so hard at times I got a side ache. Even if you have never ridden a horse in your life this is doable and you will have the time of your life. Our instructor/guide for the day was Julio, and I can't say enough good things about his patience, professionalism and enthusiasm for his sport. At the end of the day we once again were treated to coffee/tea and pastries, and then sadly it was time to depart. If you do nothing else while in Buenos Aires, consider this experience of a lifetime playing the \"Sport of Kings\" in the country that has the best players in the world."

By now if you have read the reviews, you must realize that the Polo Day experience at Puesto Viejo is not to be missed. Neither my wife not I had ever come close to playing polo, but that didn't matter. Julio is not only a great polo teacher and storyteller, but also one of the coolest guys you will ever meet. The ranch itself is wonderful and it was a nice break from the city. They serve wonderful food- that steak was amazing- and take a look at the rooms they have available; if we find ourselves in Buenos Aires again, staying there is definitely an option. You have whetted our appetites for polo and we are now looking for places around our home to learn, but it will not be nearly as much fun as chasing that pelota around the Estancia that Saturday afternoon."

First of all, i want to say that of the two of us that had visited one of us had never ridden a horse nor did we know much about the sport of Polo. We even were able to watch a Polo match. We had an amazing experience thanks to Julio and the entire staff of Puesto Viejo. This was the highlight of our trip! Wish we would have spent a couple of nights at the resort instead of just the one day. Through Julio and his staff we learned about the sport, his personal experiences being a professional player, and some of the rules of the game. The best part though was actually gearing-up and playing ourselves. We were taught how to handle a horse along with how to play the sport. We were also served two great meals. Would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Buenos Aires. Again, even if you've never ridden a horse or don't know anything about the sport, we highly recommend you pay them a visit. Also the door to door pickup service was a great bonus (Thanks Serigo)"

A day spent in the Argentine countryside in beautiful surroundings, warm welcoming hosts, delicious asado and quality polo instruction and teaching makes for a truly unforgettable experience.The whole day was amazing. It starts with a friendly and courteous driver escorting you from the city to Puesto Viejo in a comfortable private car. The journey takes around an hour but its nice to see the change from city to country. You're then welcomed by your hosts who are so hospitable with refreshments and informative conversation about themselves, the place and the sport. The property is beautifully decorated in Old World style which makes you feel like it's a home away from home.The surroundings are breathtaking and there's an opportunity to use the bikes to really get into the outdoor spirit. There's a tour of the stables and an introduction to what will be taught throughout the day. As a complete novice, the lessons were so well taught that I felt completely prepared to get on the horse and get some swing action going.The horses are well trained and you are fully equipped ready to enjoy your polo experience. The highlight is getting to try all the new found skills in a match which is so much fun! It really exceeded my expectations as polo is something I've wanted to try for a very long time.If that wasn't enough, you get spoiled with a fabulous lunch spread with so much choice of empanadas, salads, asado, dessert and malbec. All enjoyed with a fabulous view and relaxed atmosphere and the group all sat together sharing the meal. You are also treated to an afternoon tea after your day to relax and reflect on your new found ability to play polo.It's definitely somewhere where I'd love to visit again both as a resident and to play polo and highly recommend Puesto Viejo for an unforgettable experience that goes above and beyond. I wish everyone there the best of luck and hope to see you again!Muchas gracias!"

They were an absolute joy to ride, and knew that they did not have professionals on their backs! We felt like they were looking after us too! I've ridden a lot in the past and was not disappointed, as my horse was very responsive, (it was NOT like many riding experiences where the horses do the same thing day in, day out and just follow each other). My husband has only ridden a couple of times in the past, and was equally as comfortable and happy playing polo at Puesto Viejo.The property is beautiful, and the facilities second to none. The food we were served was fantastic, and we enjoyed it on a shaded terrace outside, overlooking the polo fields where the professionals were warming up for their afternoon game.

Everything went smoothly from pick up to drop off, a nice car was sent for the transfers from Teatro Colon on Cerrito, and it took around 45 minutes to get there on a Saturday morning (though this might be a little more during the week when there is considerably more traffic). The Estancia itself is large and the staff very warm and welcoming. Refreshments are there when you arrive, and then its off to the horses. I was a little concerned that as a singe traveller I might be a bit of a third wheel, but everything was very inclusive. Our instructor Julio could not have been more patient, encouraging, funny or informative. I haven't been on a horse in 15 years, but was at once made to feel at ease with a very calm horse, proper quality headgear and good instruction. It takes a while to get the hang of hitting the ball and not the ground, but by the end of the day I was playing a mini match with Julio and the other guests and spent the entire time laughing (and trying to get our breath back - it was actually quite hard work!). At the end of the day we got to watch the Pro's doing a practice match which was really fun. After working in BA all week, I was desperate to get out of the city and breathe some fresh air, and this was really the perfect way to do that whilst seeing a side of Argentinian life that you wont get in BA. The ranch also has hotel rooms, so if I ever return I will definitely stay a couple of nights, as even without the riding, the food was delicious and the pool very inviting.All in all, I cannot recommend this enough!"

We were pleasantly greeted by Maria Jose at the main office, a beautiful ranch-style building, who introduced us to Julio, our instructor for the day. After a brief rundown of the day's activities, we headed over to the stables for a tour and some basic polo education. There was an option to ride bikes to the stables, but since one in our party did not have much cycling experience, Julio drove us. We first had a tour of the stables and the ongoing activities, including watching the vet/dentist work and the farrier. There are stables for several hundred horses, and the facility is exceptionally clean and well maintained. Our first polo lesson was learning to use the mallet. We stood on stools as Julio demonstrated various shots, which we then practiced. Then, horses were brought out, we mounted up, got the stirrups adjusted properly, and were off to the pitch, to practice riding, controlling the horses, and connecting with the ball. After an hour or so, we were done with the morning lesson and headed back to the office for lunch. Lunch is served outdoors, was marvellous grilled filete de falda (skirt steak) with grilled vegetables and salad, then time for an afternoon rest. When we headed back to the stables after our rest, it was time to engage in our own little scrimmage. My wife, Kathleen and I were one team, and our class companion Rebecca and Julio were the other. This was simply a blast, playing on a half pitch, with Julio making sure everyone got shots in. We then were able to watch a practice session of club members, who played at high speed on the full pitch; very exciting to watch.Julio's knowledge of everything having to do with the operation, from types of grass used for feed or for the pitch, to care of the horses, to the intracacies of the game was encyclopedic, and his enjoyment of it all was infectious. He was the perfect host for our polo day experience. I would love to spend more than just a day here. The day ended with coffee, tea and pastries on the veranda, before our drive back to BA. We had a wonderful time and will definitely be back."

I am an equestrian so the riding was right at home for me but I was worried about my husband as he does not ride. They not only had an amazingly calm horse for him but they kept things nice and slow and gave him one on one attention to help familiarize him with the horse and the sport. He spent most of the ride laughing and having a great time! That made my day even more enjoyable! If I were to return to Argentina I would come here for a week to stay and ride every day. This was definitely the best day of our trip and I cannot recommend this trip enough!"

The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. Julio, the instructor, was amazing. He was so nice and patient and kept the atmosphere very fun but made sure we learned what we needed to know to get the most out of the experience. We had a lesson in the morning with our swings and the horses then a nice asado lunch where we relaxed and got to know everyone. In the afternoon we played a \"match\" which was soooo much fun. Since there were no games going on to watch after our play, Julio took us to check out the horse training grounds and explained some of that aspect of Polo to us. We learned a lot about the game and this experience definitely gave us a greater appreciation for the sport and the desire to learn more. We would do this trip again."

My girlfriend and I were looking for a few things to do during our stay in Buenos Aires and stumbled upon polo days as an option for a day trip outside of the city. We had already done a trip to an estancia and loved that experience, so we thought this would be a great follow-up to that experience. I had very limited horse riding experience prior to this (the first horse I had ever been on was two days before the polo day). I was surprised at how well the polo day turned out. I was not only able to ride and control the horse, but was also able to control the mallet and ball fairly well. We had two lessons, the first being an introduction of both the horse and the basics of polo. We broke for a nice lunch filled with empanadas, steak, and wine. We then had the chance to walk around the grounds, and learn more about the game of polo and learn about the lifestyle of a professional polo player. We had an overall great time - the weather was perfect on top of everything. The only downside was that we went on a Friday and did not get a chance to see a true polo match played at full speed."

It was fun through and through. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a fun and relaxing day in the Argentinian countryside."

The whole day was VIP, fun, and hands on learning experience about horse riding and the game itself.The compound is beautiful, photos on their website can't even do the justice. Pastries and refreshments are provided upon arrival and we get to know our instructor. We took a bike to the horses and all of us get our equipments and got saddle up for horse riding in the morning. The instructor was super patient and explain everything clearly. Horses were amazingly easy to control. They were super reliable and they follow our commend extremely well. Lunch was great that we were glad it was 3 course even with several options for dessert! Afternoon start with polo practice and mini game. We had mini match among our group and we all had so much fun that we yell and laugh till our stomach hurts :)We were able to see the real polo match in the afternoon. Don't miss to watch the real thing. Both horses and men got incredible skills and it was a lot of actions on the court. We were sitting with staff and they were really helpful with any questions you have. After the match, we went back to the patio to get some refreshments. Polo players were chatting with our group and everyone is at ease and having good conversation.The price is actually very reasonable considering you get round trip transportation, food, lessons, equipments, and a well trained horse full day.I would recommend all of my friend to visit Buenos Aires to do Polo Day at Puesto Viejoes Estancia ( I will do it again if I come back Buenos Aires) I would wear my bike pants next time doing it, since I'm such a beginner and after full day of horse riding, my rare would appreciate it if I put more padding on it :)"

We were picked up in the city and had a pleasant ride out to the club. Once there we were greeted with tea and coffee and met our instructor, Julio. We told him we had zero experience on a horse (except for riding a donkey up a hill in Greece) and he made us feel at ease. My wife and I learned how to swing the mallets and the basics of how to ride the horses before actually getting on them. We were quickly suiting up and on the horses. After practicing on the horses for a while (which was easier than we thought it would be), we started hitting the polo balls. It was extremely fun. There was a nice break for lunch we got to know Julio while having a relaxing meal. After some coffee we were back on the horses for a fun game. It was my wife and I vs Julio. (I think he let us in based on our skill level in comparison to his). This was so much fun and the whole time he was very supportive.After playing for a while, we watched members of the club play each other on the main field. Note, they weren't there for our tourist entertainment, these were actual Polo Players who came to the club for intense practice.We finished up with a late tea and cervesa. At the end, my wife and I felt like part of the family. I would definitely do this again and feel like a got a great value with this experience. I am now allowed to wear Polo shirts!"

My husband and I just spent a fun and wonderful day at beautiful Puesto Viejo. This place is one of the top polo facilities in Argentina. But if you are a novice like us, don't let that scare you! We were picked up promptly at 10 am from a central in-town location and then had an easy 1-hour drive to the ranch.The main house is charming and the grounds are immaculate. There we were greeted warmly by staff and treated to a cup of coffee on the beautiful veranda. Then we met Julio, the professional polo player, who was our host and polo instructor for the day. He spoke perfect English and guided us thru polo 101 in a few minutes. We saddled up and got more tips on how to ride and how to hit the ball! Then we spent about an hour on the Polo field. Around 1:30 we had a delicous lunch on the veranda again, followed by some leisure time where we took a walk. (There is a beautiful pool which we did not make use of) Then we rode bikes down to the stables, mounted our trusty steeds and played a polo match. Lots of laughs! After watching the real players play a practice match for an hour, we headed back into the city. We would love to go back to Puesto Viejo. In fact, we told our kids we'd love to go back with them. Thanks Julio and the rest of the kind Puesto Viejo staff!"

A driver picked us up from the apartment where we were staying in Buenos Aires and drove us about 1.5 hours out of town to Puesto Viejo (drive time varies depending on BsBAs traffic). We were warmly greeted by the staff on arrival and met our guide/polo trainer, Julio. After a scenic bike ride to the stables, we quickly got set up with our riding equipment and were taught the basics of hitting with the polo stick and how to ride the horses. We were a bit nervous but Julio did a great job of making everyone feel comfortable. After getting comfortable on the horses and doing a bit of practice, we sat outside and enjoyed a lovely asado lunch with empanadas and A TON of meat. After lunch, we went back out to the pitch to play a game. Although we won't be signing up for the professional leagues any time soon, it was a lot of fun and everyone was laughing & enjoying themselves. Throughout it all, Julio had a great attitude, was very encouraging, and definitely made the experience memorable. At the end of the day, we concluded by watching real professionals play a practice game. That really made us appreciate how difficult the sport is and how much athleticism it takes. Lastly, we finished up with some coffee and pastries before the drive back to BsAs. They even presented us with a good luck horse shoe souvenir for us to take home. I would highly recommend this activity to anyone visiting BsAs - was our best day in the city by far. Tip - Wear sun screen!"

My husband and I have riding experience but have never played polo. While it was helpful to know how to ride, we found that most of the technique you learn in typical hunt/jump lessons go right out the window when it comes to polo. Our instructor Julio was very patient and encouraging and what's more actually made it very fun. After some basic instruction on the ground, we went right to practicing on horseback. After lunch we played a quasi match with Julio and his adorable daughter which was a lot of fun. We enjoyed the session so much that we signed up for an additional lesson the following morning (added cost). During that lesson we also got some additional help from another polo instructor working with more advanced players as well as some regulars who come to the club each year to play.At the end of the first day we got to watch a low-level match being played which was really cool to see. Over dinner we learned more about the sport from the \"regulars.\" Although it does take some bit of financial means to get into polo, it was interesting to see that there is a diverse range of people who play and it's not just for the Prince Harry's of the world. Apart from polo the stay itself was very nice. We had a lovely lunch on the patio outside the day we arrived. All the food was well prepared and tasty. We also went on 2 \"trail\" rides around the property led by different grooms. They didn't speak much English and our Spanish isn't great so communication was a bit difficult but we managed. The grounds are perfect for polo although maybe not as interesting for trail riding, but it was still nice to get som extra time on the horses. Overall we had a great time and are now even talking about coming back to do a full week of polo lessons.The only hitch we had was with the pick up from Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires. We weren't given much information about the pick up process--just that someone would meet us outside the main entrance. I figured it would be pretty obvious until we actually got to the theatre and realized there were several entrances and a lot of cars lined up outside. We arrived a few minutes after the meeting time so were worried we had missed the pick up. Finally, in desperation I had to make an international call on my cell phone to the club. It took several tries to finally get through to someone and then they confirmed the driver was running a few minutes late. Finally a basic cab car pulled up and the driver called us over. There weren't any signs or anything so if we hadn't called the club I'm not sure how we would've connected with him. After that everything was fine. On the return they took us directly to our hotel which was helpful. But I would advise trying to make the pick up process from BA a little more clear. "

Julio our \"instructor\" took us through our paces, teaching us to \"how to swing a mallet\" and hopefully connect with the ball, and \"how to ride a horse\", somehow we were supposed to do both at the same time. Under Julio's expertise instruction, we managed to achieve both, at a slightly slow speed than the professionals. We were collected from Buenos Aires in the morning, and after a very pleasant drive we arrived at the lush green estate of Puesto Viejo Polo Club. Coffee and cakes were served as we filled out all the necessary paper work, then we were whisked off to the horses stables to begin our first ever experience with polo. The morning was full of laughter as Julio showed us how it should be done. We then retired to the main house for a very delicious and filling lunch and some much deserved relaxation time. In the afternoon it was time put our new found skills to the ultimate test- a game with some of Argentina's finest polo players, and we did ok !!!!. As the day wound down we watched the professionals participate in a practise match, followed by a well-deserved drink and then back to Buenos Aires. This day was one of the most memorable days we had in Argentina, and highly recommend it to everyone regardless of your horse riding skills or lack of them."

We've been picked up ahead of time in very nice car and made the trip in reasonable time. We were welcomed very lovely and got some refreshment and information. Soon Julio, our trainer, picked us up for the first lesson (just the 3 of us). He is a very kind and joyful guy and taught us splendidly. The lunch also stuck out and after that we could enjoy our 2nd lesson and watch some of the members and trainers play some practice matches. It was a lovely experience and the way back was as smooth as the first trip. I was just a little suprised, that we left roughly 50minutes earlier than what was announced on the homepage. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our day there and will recommend it furhter. Best wishes from Germany."

You can't visit Argentina without experiencing an estancia and this place must be one of the best. We spent two days at Puesto Viejo with one of the nights staying in the hotel. I am a beginner at horse riding and was a bit worried I might not be qualified to ride there but they have amazing beginner polo ponies you can ride that are a world apart from the horses I rode in the UK. It's much more relaxed and the horses are used to beginners so I found it much easier. I had barely done a rising trot at home and was galloping within 20 mins! The scenery is beautiful too and you fee so free riding in such an open space. We also did clay pigeon shooting which was a great experience that you should really try. One of the most memorable moments of my travels - ever - was on a horse at this estancia with the sun setting. I will never forget it. Thank you to the amazing, friendly staff that helped make the experience so wonderful. See you again next year!"

The estancia is 45 mins drive from BA which is ideal after a long flight and also allows you to pop into BA for the day/night during your stay should you choose to do so. The hotel is relaxed and extremely comfortable. The setup is very communal and inclusive. Meals are taken together so you immediately get the feeling of being part of the \"family\"; ideal if you are travelling alone. Jeremy and the hotel staff are exceedingly welcoming and friendly - nothing seems too much trouble. Food is excellent and plentiful. Lunch is typically taken outside in the garden, whilst breakfast and dinners are indoors. The grounds of the hotel are simply stunning - infinity swimming pool, stick and ball field, magnificent club house and four superb polo pitches; soon to be five. Days typically start with an hour or so lesson and S&B practice (with as many horses as you like, your body permitting!!). After lunch and a hour or so chill out by the pool, matches kick off from around 4pm onwards. Matches are either tournament games (if you have entered) or more relaxed club chukkas. Tuition is excellent - very insightful, patient and precise. The overall ambience of the place is total relaxation and tranquillity. I could not recommend Puesto Viejo more highly. Enjoy!!"

Located about an hour outside of Buenos Aires, Puesto Viejo is perhaps one of the best ways to spend a Saturday or Sunday away from the hustle and bustle of the city and in a serene and calming landscape of the Argentine country. My friends and I were all in Buenos on a 2 month rotation for our jobs and were looking for a weekend adventure, and figured why not give a go at polo. We signed up for a full day polo experience on a Sunday, and let me just say that coming from the US where similar types of experiences could be costly, Puesto Viejo provided a high quality experience at a great value - from transportation to/from Buenos, to the plentiful asado (bbq) at lunch, and finally to the horseback riding and polo playing (or at least our group's ATTEMPT at playing polo), our day had a seemingly event-filled yet relaxing pace. Jeremy and Lily were more than accommodating hosts, and made us feel at home from the coffee and cakes in the morning after being dropped off, to the end of the day celebratory libations before being sent off. Jeremy and Lily were exceptional teachers at polo, and despite our group's relative lack of skill at the game, we were all able to have a good laugh during our practice game. We also got to see a match between one of the Puesto Viejo clubs and a visiting club. Our group was going to play winner, but decided there wasn't enough light left in the day, so decided against it....we'll see you on the pitch another time Puesto Viejo!Thanks guys for an amazing experience and good luck Puesto Viejo in the tournaments this coming polo season!"

I had not been on a horse since I was a girl scout, but the saddle (English) was very comfortable and Gaston carefully guided me through all the moves. What a great time! Then, we were treated to a family style luncheon on the arbored patio o f the hotel and the food never stopped! At first, I thought the lunch was the little pastries (delicious) they call empenadas, and that would have been enough. But, then came salads, chicken, beef, wine, water, and dessert!

I never thought I would be able to ride a horse and swing a stick at the same time, but thanks to the amazing teacher and a great horse I did it. It was a great day with lots of fun. I can recommend it to everybody, even to those who haven't been on a horse yet."

I spoke with the owner of LandingPad before the trip and he said 'of the hundred offerings we have in Buenos Aires, Puesto Viejo Full Polo Day is a MUST'. Thank you Jed!We were picked up at a central location in BA at 10am, with a British and a Canadian couple who were wonderful (the British we anticipate staying in touch with!) After a beautiful 45 minute ride we arrived at an alluring polo farm. As a note, I have never been on a horse in my life. In the AM we had polo lessons, covering rules, striking the ball, riding etc. This was followed by a huge asado lunch with every part of the cow chicken and pig you can imagine, and of course bottomless malbec. In the afternoon we played 4v4 polo, with the 6 of us guests, a professional and a local 10 year old (who was of course much better than all of us!) Afterwards, we watched a professional match of the estancia's team in a tournament game. The estancia was beautiful, charming, welcoming - we wish we had stayed the night in their hotel. All of the staff and guests were wonderful! We met the owner, a Brithish expat who unbeknown is an alum of the company I currently work for. He was a gracious host!If you are ever in BA, Puesto Viejo is an absolute MUST. #1 recommendation for the trip. We will absolutely be back!"

We booked this Polo day for New Year's Eve & were amazingly welcomed into the owner's family & friends for a beautiful day of Polo match, polo lesson, asauda, carriage ride, pool relaxation in a beautiful estancia 45 minutes from Buenos Aires.Our day started with a beautiful drive to the Estancia when we arrived in the country, little owls were perched on most all of the fence posts as we drove in! We were greeting by Lilliana & Jeremy & Irene & welcomed to cake & tea. We then watched a polo match! We had never seen polo played & it was amazing to watch. We then took a lovely ride with gauchos in a carriage around the property where we saw a lot of birds & wildlife.Next we had a polo lesson where we stood on stools & learned to swing the mallet. Then onto the horses for the real deal!! We don't ride horses often so I was so surprised how quickly we learned & were able to actually swing the mallet & hit the ball!! After our lesson we had a marvelous asaudo & then rested by the pool. Then it was time for the mini match of polo! Jeremy's family was visiting for the holidays so the players in the mini match were children & family members so we were not intimidated by our low skill level! This was really great fun!Then we were welcomed to cheesecake & tea & then back to Buenos Aires.Polo is such a part of the Argentine culture & we were so glad that we were able to spend a day at Puesto Viejo & experience this in such a beautiful setting. We also want to thank Jeremy & Lilliana for letting us be a part of their family day & for being so welcoming! Thank you so much for such an amazing day!"

My husband was a complete novice, and my last experience was before my twenties \u2013 which was a long time ago. We were welcomed with coffee and cake (always a good start, in my book), and then had the pleasure of watching a match from the sideline. It was fast. It was furious. It was a little scary. My husband went very, very quiet. We then climbed up on stools to practice swinging the mallet. Suddenly, most of the people in the group realised that there was something we could do! We connected with the ball! It moved more than a metre from where we were perched on stools! There was hope! Gaston and Jeremy were infinitely patient, correcting our stance (reminding me that I wasn\u2019t playing golf, and that there would be a horse underneath me later in the day). And then \u2013 the moment arrived. We met our mounts. We put on our helmets, clambered on the back of sleek, well-cared for horses, and walked at a sedate pace to the polo field. Our initial training was learning the signals to make the horse go, stop, turn left and turn right \u2013 which are, I believe, slightly different to \u2018normal\u2019 horse riding. Then, we learnt how to swing the mallet. Then, in what seemed like an impossibility just an hour or so before, we learnt how to gallop. Towards a small white ball. Waving a big mallet in the air. It was incredible! At times, we even managed to move on the horse, at a pace, swing the mallet, and connect with the ball!That was enough excitement for one morning. We adjourned for lunch, which was a fantastically filling meat-fest and with more wine than was probably necessary \u2013 although of course it was our choice to drink it, and other options were available. We had a couple of hours to relax, before mounting up again and heading out to play a chukka! Each team had the pleasure of a seasoned player to \u2018move things along\u2019 \u2013 and we were off. It was enormously satisfying to realise that we were, actually, playing polo. Slowly, I grant you, but we were playing nonetheless. With a little help from Santiago and Jeremy, we managed to notch up a couple of goals between us, before turning the horses in for a well-earned rest. We were then given the freedom of the hotel pool until we chose to leave. I cannot wait to return to Puesto Viejo. The service in the hotel was second-to-none. The welcome was warm. The horses are responsive. The trainers are committed. It was an incredible day, and one that I hope to share with guests when they come to Argentina."

After starting off with an early coffee and tea we watched one of several polo matches going on that day at the club, during which Jeremy explained to us the rules and strategies of the sport. We then had a lesson, first learning to hit the ball standing still and soon later while moving on a horse. After a nice asado we regrouped and actually a played a match amongst ourselves. Truly amazing that after only a couple of hours all the members of our group were actually able to play some polo.We have visited several estancias in the greater Buenos Aires area, but having the chance to actually play polo with no previous experience was amazing. The owner, instructors, and staff were warm and attentive, making sure we got the full Argentine polo experience. Can't wait to go back!"

I found out about Puesto Viejo Polo Days thru Landingpadba.com (they always have great recommendations) and I decided this would be the perfect activity to bring my brother and his girlfriend to when they came to visit. We chose the full-day option and it was SO lovely being away from the hustle and bustle of the city for a day. Gaston is incredibly welcoming and knowledgable about all things polo...and not too bad on the eyes ;). We had so much fun with him! We also met other members of the polo club who were very nice and interesting people. We had a traditional asado with everyone and got to ask them a lot of questions about polo! The polo lessons were fun but definitely tough. I can't say that I was an expert when I left but I hit the ball a lot of times and even learned some trick shots. Although I was sore for 3 days after and I thought I was going to have to cut off my arm it was well worth the pain. My brother wasn't sore so I guess I just have to work on my upper body strength. But I highly recommend this to everyone! Probably better if you have had some experience horseback riding before, it was easier to be comfortable swinging the mallet because I was not worried about falling off the horse"

Later went on the horses, beautiful healthy and fit ones. After one hour on the field hitting the ball we had a barbecue and then hit the fields again for and actual polo match. Made 2 teams and after we learned all the rules the polo instructor coached us to have the best group activity of my life.

Having just opened a bed and breakfast in Buenos Aires I am acutely aware that any recommendations we make reflect on the guest's whole experience (and their subsequent trip advisor reviews of our hospitality). However, when a couple of guests with very limited riding skills wanted to try a polo day, I was happy to point them in the direction of Puesto Viejo. Given it was a nice day I decided to go with them. I've played polo for 15 years and the great thing about PV is that it has horses for all levels from total schoolmasters to competitive playing horses. In my time I have seen some horrors when people have been put on horses that were not suitable for them (the Argentines often think being able to ride is genetically inbuilt into all humans) so the assurance that PV's English owner has a more balanced view on safety is important. Of course no equestrian activity is risk free, but Gaston makes sure that his pupils pick up the basics quickly and are mounted on something that is not going to frighten them. For me he picked out a horse that was quick and responsive but easy, as I hadn't ridden for a couple of years. My clients were thrilled to be able to actually hit the ball at a jog by the end of a few hours and as one of them was a talented sportsman he ended up hitting further than I can, which led to a good ribbing during the asado and wine that was provided in generous quantities at lunch. Satiated, we sat in the sun on the clubhouse's first floor terrace to watch a practice match and then took a quick dip before making our way back to town. All in all a great day, well organised and in beautiful surroundings."

Gaston assessed our levels of experience and gave all of us some one on one time to make the most of our different abilities. My reservations about the day faded and we ended up having great family fun, by the finish it even got quite competitive. The lunch (much more my thing) was excellent; we sat under the trees on a spectacular property and soaked up the glorious weather. I also had a quick look round the hotel and wished I\u2019d stayed the night.

As it was the \"off season\", we were aware ahead of time we probably would not get to observe polo players practicing and Gaston was out of the country during our visit. However, he arranged for us to meet with Emiliano while we were there and he was wonderfully helpful and knowledgeable about polo. He helped us during the morning and by lunchtime, we were trotting the horses and actually hitting the ball with the mallet occasionally! The lunch was wonderful and we dined with other guests in the beautifully ranch house dining room. The afternoon was rained out, so they offered a refund of part of our rate. This is by far a \"must\" for anyone traveling to BA. You feel like you're far away from the huge city, but it is actually a really easy drive. We would definitely go here again."

After lunch we have another lesson and then a small game between the four of us. We won! :) Then we watched a practice game and Gaston explained to us what is happening.

When the other PV Polo Day guests arrived we were served tea, coffee and mate together with some delicious cake while being introduced to Gaston (the instructor) and the place. The beginners were taught how to swing the mallet and move in the saddle before we got on the horses. Gaston is a great teacher and the horses they use are amazing, very well trained and extremely patient. Gaston would correct my mistakes and I could feel the improvement after only a few minutes. The beginners learned very fast and they could pretty soon do a full swing! After our first lesson we were served a delicious lunch! After lunch we went to watch Gaston and his team play the semi final in the Farewell Tournament, which they won! It was amazing how fast they played and how well they hit the ball! Throughout the game people around us would explain the game, the faults, the rules etc. and they were so friendly and chatty. After watching the game we got back on the horses again. Before we played our own mini match we did some 'stick and ball' and practiced some tactics and went through the main rules. We played boys against girls. It was so much fun! Obviously the girls won 5-4! Several times during the day we were laughing so much we would almost fall off the horses and for sure miss the ball! I cannot recommend this highly enough. If you're in Argentina you have to try polo. It doesn't matter if you can ride or not, if you've ever sat on a horse, or if you've never tried polo before. Gaston can teach you everything! It's a beautiful place where polo is played at a high level. The people working there are so friendly and helpful and the food is impeccable!

My coach, who was a pro, spent a great deal of time with each individual, endlessly trying to perfect their swing. Not only this, we had two people in our group who had never ridden before and our coach dedicated his time to building up their confidence on the horse. Once we had spent some time stick and balling, at walk, trot and canter, it was time for a mini match. I thoroughly enjoyed trying to put into practice all we had learnt, with the rules of the sport explained to us.After this, and having said goodbye and a big thank you to the horse, we went to the idyllic hotel for a traditional asado. It was served by charming waitresses and had a big family feel with our coach coming to eat with us, as well as an assortment of hotel guests. The food was to die for. Once lunch finished, we were treated to a polo match and it was a great thrill to understand more of the sport. Thank you very much PV! I hope to return soon."

We met Gast\u00f3n and shared some mate while hearing about the basics of 'the sport of kings'. Then it was off to the field!Gaston is kind and patient and clearly enthusuastic and passionate about his sport! Having had no previous riding experience - never mind hitting a ball with a mallet whilst on a moving horse! - I thought it would be a rather tricky undertaking. But instead of being mortifyingly horrible, i managed to make contact with the ball on quite a few occassions. Gast\u00f3n makes one feel at ease and the learning, fun!The asado lunch was ample, and the dessert even more so! After lunch, we had time to explore the beautiful estancia. Pristine pitches, a glorious pool, top-class stables... we even went for a carriage ride with Luis! A polo match amongst the club members followed, and what a spectacle that was! Seeing polo happen at such a speed!Thank you for an unforgettable day! I'd highly recommend PVPD for anyone wanting to have a mind-blowing experience!"

Neither me nor my wife play polo and we are rather too old to learn now but this did not stop us from having a really delightful day at Puesto Viejo. The hotel there is informal and wow what a reception from the staff and owners. A pool and horses all over the place! A new experience for us and so if you don't play polo don't worry go there just the same and have a real fun day. It's less than an hour from BA on a first class road."

We wanted to do something unique and a little bit adventurous whilst in Argentina (I\u2019d never ridden a horse before) and this ended up being the perfect choice. We chose Puesto Viejo over some of the other polo days that are around because it seemed less \u201ccommercial\u201d and, being a fairly new venture, we thought we would get a great service and be welcomed by the staff. That is exactly what happened. Gaston was a fun host, clearly passionate about polo and horses, chatting to us all day about various topics and making us feel totally at home on the estate. We met a few of the hotel guests while relaxing on the property and watching a polo match. One of the staff volunteered to join us to make up a group of 4 so we could play a mini match towards the end of the day. The horses were beautiful and seemed very well cared for. Enjoying the pool and the grounds was very relaxing during our 90 minute down-time after lunch. All combined, this was definitely an experience we will remember and recommend to others."

Puesto Viejo's \"polo day\" offering is a unique combination of excercise, fun, excitement and a challenge, all set in the beautiful surroundings of an Argentine estancia, its amazing... really !! Close to BA and the international airport, the estancia has luxurious amenities such as a swimming pool ( to cool-off in after chukkas..phew ) and carefully prepared, typical Argentine food and hospitality. Previous riding experience is not required, as we found out, indeed those of us who had not ridden a horse before took to the sport more quickly than the accomplished riders amongst us...something to do with having no inhibitions ! The instructors, Chino and Gaston were very patient, speaking both English and Spanish and the horses were calm and patient too! After our instruction we watched a full-on polo game from the clubhouse, so got a feel for the speed and skillful nature of the sport, overall a great experience, not to be missed on an Argentine trip."

Irene and Gaston were so friendly and welcoming, and we had a few rides with Louis on some beautiful horses.The highlight however, was a 'polo' day with Gaston, who is super-friendly and an excellent coach.

Learning about polo with Gaston was certainly one of the great highlights of my two month long trip through Chile and Argentina. The level of personal attention certainly sets this day apart from all the other activities I have done. The day starts with a transfer from BA to Puesto Viejo followed by tea, coffee and a selection of small cakes. Soon it is off to the stables to meet the horses and a quick brief on riding and polo. The day is suitable for beginners or for people already comfortable on horseback as Gaston provides excellent individual attention to all of his clients. After the brief there is a one to two hour polo lesson focusing on the basic ball work and horse riding skills used in polo. Up next is a beautiful asado in the tree shaded patio of the hotel with your fellow polo players followed by an hour or so to relax by the pool or take a short stroll. After the high heat of the afternoon passes it is back to the stables, this time to play in your very own polo match. After a great deal of fun playing your own game with any luck you will get to watch the \"practica\" which is a friendly match among the excellent players who work for or are visiting the estancia. I was amazed at the skill and speed of the game, it is truly a beautiful thing to watch. After more tea (or a nice cold beer) and some good conversation with Gaston and the Puesto Viejo family it is unfortunately time to head back to the city. I promise at the end of the day you won't want to leave! This is a trip not to be missed and the attention to detail and relaxed atmosphere sets Polo Days apart making you feel more like part of their family than a tourist there for a visit. Thanks again for a great day Gaston!"

Last year I rode outside of Buenos Aires and earlier this year I spent two weeks riding in Tuscany. So when I traveled to Argentina again, I knew I had to try polo this time! I decided to stay at Puesto Viejo and to do the Polo Day when I was there. It was fantastic! We started with some mate and some sweets while Gaston told us all sorts of stuff about polo. Then it was time to head to the stables! At first we were instructed in how to hold the mallet and practiced some swings while standing on blocks. Gaston showed us how to swing and how to position our bodies. Hm, how would I transfer this to an actual horse? The next step, of course, was to get on the horse. I rode a beautiful mare named Purita. And off to the field we went! At first I was nervous but after a little while it was just fun and very addictive. Since it was just my friend and I, Gaston gave us lots of personalized instruction. I was sad when the morning session was over! We then ate a delicious lunch with Gaston and other hotel guests before spending some time at the pool. (I stayed away from the wine since I figured it wouldn't be very helpful for my riding!) After lunch we watched a polo game as there was a tournament going on at the time. It was crazy to see the real pros doing this! Gaston was playing as well and wow, he is not only a great teacher but an awesome professional player... Then it was our turn! We went back to the stables and headed to the field. After some more practice, Gaston staged a little mini match for us. He brought in Juanchi, a fifteen year old who was already really good! I had the honor of playing with Gaston and yay we won! My friend will never get over it! Our day was so much fun and I can't thank Gaston enough. He is warm and friendly and made us very much at ease, plus he made us laugh a lot! He is a real star. Plus, of course, the fact that even though he is an international pro polo player, he still has all sorts of patience for people like me! The people in the stables were also great, gracias Luis, Julio, Matias! This was the total highlight of my trip and I recommend it to everybody."

Within minutes you feel you have known Gaston for years as he explains the history of the estancia and polo. After a tour of the property, Gaston took us to the barn where we became familiar with the sticks and swing techniques. Once on the field, Gaston worked with us until we were all feeling pretty good about our abilities to perform basic polo moves. At lunch time we went back to the house and were served an incredible asado on the terrace. As we sipped Argentine wine, Gaston talked us through the rules of polo.Following lunch we strolled around the property and admired the gardens, pool, and guestrooms. That afternoon, we actually played a match. How Gaston can teach absolute beginners to be playing a match in one day is still a mystery to me. Following our match, we sat in the garden and were served tea, mate, and pastries as we laughed about our adventure. What an experience. The most difficult thing about the entire experience was leaving Puesto Viejo. Gaston, Eirin, and everyone on the property went out of their way to make everything perfect. We cannot wait to return."

This seemed a flight of fancy but sure enough, after a morning's lesson (and a good lunch with wine or soft drinks) we took part in a match that would probably have the great Cambiaso clutching his sides but nevertheless we stayed up top and managed to hit the ball whilst moving.....this we considered an achievement for beginners. Before this we spent a very lazy hour and a half watching real polo players in a competitive game from the comfort of the infinity swimming pool. Believe me, on a sunny day, life doesn't get much better. Gaston was brilliant, tolerant and a great teacher. Great guy also, he has played polo in UK so speaks good English.

Not only will you learn how to play polo, you will also enjoy pretty landscapes, beautiful horses, really tasty food and the professional trainer Gaston and the other members of the stuff are really nice, speak many languages, care about you and make the experience perfect. You will also have a lot of fun - we laughed the whole day and really enjoyed it. The service is amazing, Gaston even picks you up and brings you back to Buenos Aires driving safely and sharing his polo experiences with you. The place is beautiful and everything is clean and nice. You even get fresh Argentinian Mate. I would repeat this experience anytime and really recommend you to try it out- you won't want to leave at the end of the day!!"

After shopping around and talking to people in the know, Puesto Viejo appeared to offer everything I was looking for. So much so that I returned on four separate occasions and loved every minute of it. Gaston was a hugely fun, patient and knowledgable instructor and the beautiful surroundings and great food only added to an already super experience. This is a must-do activity for experienced and beginner riders a like!"

Coming from Australia and having both ridden horses my daughter Cecilia who is 13 and myself had an amazing day at Puesto Viejo ...I had a fall earlier this year and fractured a vertebra and my daughter ,s pony had passed away with illness so we were tentative but once we met Gaston all that disappeared , we learnt the basics of polo we laughed and totally enjoyed our 2goals and had the best time . The lunch was superb empanadas, beef wine and we loved Angeles we felt so comfortable and well looked after. After lunch Gaston gave us a golf buggy and we buzzed all over the farm to the stables ..horses were excellent.Cecilia fell in love with Gastons dog we didn't want to leave coming back next year for a week. Anyone visiting Beunos Aries should not miss a polo day or days at Puesto Veijo"

The horses were great - very well schooled to put up with novices swinging the sticks around haphazardly!I wish we could have seen a practice match but it was out of season so couldn't be helped. The food was delicious and loads of it. I would really recommend this day to anyone who wants to have a go at polo for the first time whether or not they are a rider (I am a fairly experienced rider and still really enjoyed it).

Gaston reminds us to relax and let the stick swing like a pendulum. A break for an amazing BBQ lunch under the trees, followed by a swim in the divine pool is the perfect way to gear up for the afternoon's lessons/practice match.If you're lucky enough you may get to see some of the professional 2-6 goal players battle it out on the field!As the sun is setting your escort back to Buenos Aires awaits and you wish you had of booked a whole weeks stay on the estancia.Polo Days At Puesto Viejo Estancia with Gaston Carrozzo was the highlight of our stay in Buenos Aires without a doubt."

But not only that, I managed to hit the ball and make 4 goals! Amazing. I had a very great time that day, amazing food and really nice company. Getting out of the city and enjoying the serenity of the countryside was like therapy, even for a guy who usually doesn't leave the favorite barrio Palermo.

It was amazing, we made some empanadas (the best I've ever had)and few other things. We had some wine, we ate what we have made and we chat all day long. It was great introduction to the city tour on following day as we discussed a bit more about the Argentinian history, food, customs, music. We share some mate tea and to be honest we talked about just anything.The following day we had a city tour with Joy.We've seen amazing places, we found out great facts from Argentinian history, we had some great food and all with a lot of fun.We'll recommend Joy to anyone. She is very professional and passionate about what she does."

As a local, Joy was able to give us a great insight of the history and culture of the city and the people (Porte\u00f1os). Taking the local buses and walking to the sights was so much fun.I highly recommend Joy as a tour guide. Thank you for the great day!"

In her own words, she's genuinely there because she wants to be - and it shows. She had an answer for everything and wasn't scared to give us all the details on the city's past, however unsettling some stories may be. She was great at highlighting links between certain sites and tying up the city's history for us. She was happy to create a personalised tour for us, encompassing all the sites we specifically wanted to see. She was a lot of fun and just radiates - well - joy! She is an absolute pleasure and I could not recommend a day with her enough! Happy touring guys :)"

            "review": "Walking Tour and Drum Workshop - First Class!!. I wanted to see Buenos Aires from a local's point of view and from someone knowledgeable on all that this amazing city has to offer. A friend recommended Joy and to be honest I was very impressed, beyond what I was hoping for. I considered a free tour, but the lack of 'the personal touch' of these large group tours did not appeal. This is something you get in bucket loads with Joy! From the outset you appreciate how much passion she has for her home town and her depth of knowledge is really quite impressive! Joy was very accommodating in making sure that the tour included the key areas I wanted to see, and shaped it around local events to ensure we did not miss anything going on, and I came away more knowledgeable on this great city and very happy with the way the tour was organised and delivered. Communication leading up to the tour was spot on too, Joy could not be more helpful!Following on from my tour of BA, I booked the Drum Workshop that Joy also offers. I had been somewhat inspired by the spine-tingling sounds of the drums that you often hear around the streets and suburbs of Buenos Aires (plus the percussion show 'La Bomba De Tiempo' which is stunning and sealed the deal for me...!), so thought that the workshop would be a great follow-on experience. Again, I was not disappointed! Not being musically talented in the least and lacking in the rhythm department, I initially thought that it might not quite be for me, but nothing ventured, nothing gained....Our workshop host Diego, soon put any concerns at ease as we learned about the origins of the music of Argentina and in particular the various drums that you would hear around Argentina and even Uruguay. Soon we were having a 'jam' session on the drums and Diego quickly instilled rhythm that I didn't know I had...! I had such a fun and engaging experience that I even asked for the names of the drums that I liked the most so that I can buy some on my return to the UK. My neighbours will love me..! :)All in all, I can highly recommend the guided tour and drum workshop, both arranged with Joy, and when I return to Buenos Aires later this year, I have discussed further tours with Joy, including a Tango Experience and a visit to one of the local futbol matches, to complete the whole experience. As a guide and host, you will not find better than Joy, and I felt compelled to write an honest review as she really makes you feel like a friend rather than a customer. A++++++ Clive from Scotland."

We had an amazing day from beginning to end.Just a few notes about what we saw. The 1st firehall in Argentina. The firehall has museum pieces and new equipment.All firefighters in Argentina are volunteers The Boca Jr. Stadium re: 12 player The graffiti wall about the disappeared The immigrants bridge The memorial under the bridge for the disappeared who's personal effects were found when the police station was torn downThe old tenements in La Boca which are now stores but you can see where whole families lived in boxes.Another good coffee house. Coffee comes with a glass of water and small cookies. Milk costs extra. I love the little snacks and water especially because it was very hot.We saw the Rosa ! San Martin's crypt, The British flags taken when Argentina defeated Britain.The embassy for France, BritainWe walked and rode the busesGrabbed an empanada.......and moreAs we made our way down Defense to Plaza de Mayo we first stopped and Joy explained about Mate and made us some. I liked it very much.Then we began to meet union people. There was/is a big protest today over wages and a large number of people being fired from the government. We stopped and chatted with some. Joy lead us further and we met many leaving the plaza as their part was done. The plaza was still packed with people and it was a little overwhelming. Joy says this is only a small protest and we would be fine. The only time to worry is if the police get threatening. Also don't worry about big bangs it us only fireworks.Joy is energetic, articulate, knowledgeable and very proud of her wonderful city. Thank you Joy."

She was SO helpful and lovely from the moment we got in touch. It was so great to have local knowledge from a friendly and relatable person. She asked us about what types of activities we would like to do whilst in Buenos Aires and looked into different options and prices for us. These included Tango Shows, Yoga Classes, Bars and Restaurants, Walking Tours, Shopping, Gardens, Museums, Markets, History, Music Shows etc. Joy made a suggestion to do a drum workshop with a local drummer and also told us about a drum show that is really popular. We did the drumming workshop on a Monday afternoon and the show was on later that night. Joy met us in the city and showed us how to use the Subway system, which we used at least once a day for the rest of our trip. (So helpful) In the workshop we got to have some tea and chat about the history and culture of what drumming means to the locals. It was so nice to see the passion of our teacher Diego. We got to learn different rhythms and techniques and use a large variety of drums. Diego made us feel so welcome in his home (where the lesson takes place) and it was an amazing experience that not many tourists would get the opportunity to do. Later on, at the drum show we could really appreciate the drummers talents and understand the work of the 'conductors'. We had such a fun day and definitely recommend the workshop to anyone travelling to Buenos Aires. Joy is very professional and a beautiful soul who made our stay in Buenos Aires so much better. \u2764\ufe0f"

Two days of our trip were spent with Joy of Buenos Aires. Although we could have crammed all the city tour spots into one day, which is what a lot of people do, we opted to do it over two whole days, giving us ample time to explore off-the-beaten path site, take unlimited photos and shoot videos, relax as needed and snack whenever we desired. Choosing two days (with a break in-between) was the best decision we made, and the 16 hours we spent with Joy, in a wide variety of situations, simply revealed to us that she is undoubtedly pursuing her passion! And there's nothing better than having a guide/friend who seems as excited about her tours (ones she's done numerous times!) as you are. It makes a big difference! And in this day and age, where websites and ads often exaggerate a person's or product's accomplishments or benefits, my feeling is that Joy gives you amazing value for your investment. And her website and Facebook page accurately reflect who she is and what she can do. Thank you, Joy!"

Joy was energetic, enthusiastic, passionate and incredibly driven to provide us with an amazing tour of Buenos Aries. She picked us up from the hotel promptly and briefed us for the day's itinerary which was comprehensive yet concise. Joy immediately made us feel relaxed and excited for the day's activities through her passionate and bubbly personality. Safety was never an issue. Joy was able to interlock the historical and cultural significance of Argentina and Buenos Aries into the flow of events for the day. This provided a very fun filled tour that ended up feeling like you were walking through the past and present of Buenos Aries through an amazing story. Would highly recommend Joy for any tour of Buenos Aries."

She has a bright and bubbly personality making her instantly loveable, and the excitement she exudes about being able to show off her beautiful country is contagious. She not only has an extensive knowledge and understanding of the history and culture of Argentina, but also the current hot spots of today so you get to really experience the country like a local. It was such a pleasure to meet Joy, she made my absolutely amazing trip from Buenos Aires to Rio de Janeiro one I will never forget. I would recommend a tour with Joy to all!!"

We sampled everything from the AMAZING food and wine to the tours of the city and the night life which was incredible. We were never made to feel under pressure to make decisions as Joy knew the city very well and was able to suggest things that we'd like, and she was always happy to change plans if we wanted to do something spontaneous.

If ever being supremely professional as well as bubbly becomes an Olympic sport, she would run away with the gold medal. She loves her job and her home city, and it shone through, countless times going above and beyond the call of duty\u2026I mean, who else would scour the beach stalls trying to buy a pair of speedos or \u201czunga\u2019s\u201d for one of her group?  I went on a trip with Joy in 2014, travelling from her home town of Buenos Aires through to Rio as part of a small mixed tour group. Many of us are still friends to this day. Much of that was down to Joy\u2019s enthusiasm and attention to detail. Even on her days or evenings off, she still came out with the group as we wanted her with us. She has a great dry sense of humour and her local knowledge of where to go and experience the culture was second to none. You really felt you got the benefit of escaping the usual tourist traps and really seeing the city as it really is. She had a genuine interest in your life too and tailored the programme to what you wanted\u2026whether that was taking a tour of the Boca Juniors stadium, or watching some traditional dancing. Joy just wanted you to make the most of your trip and for you to enjoy yourself, without it being forced fun. To me that was important. A trip out kayaking, seeing Peron\u2019s grave, visiting a distillery or having a great meal was just as key as unwinding with a drink or two at the end of the day. Although I\u2019m sure she would have shown us every spot in town and told us every historical fact if she could, she understood that a holiday is also about a bit of R&R and so the pace of it all was just right. One last thing..Joy is a great photographer, so don\u2019t be surprised to come away with some good snaps as well as some great memories! Can\u2019t wait to go back some time and see my friend again."

I received warnings from other people I met whilst traveling to be careful in La Boca as it was a 'dodgy place', but traveling with Joy I felt safe.

As someone who was brand new to South America and coming from the US, I was excited to see the city but had read things that worried me ('blue dollar' exchanges, fake money, pickpockets, etc). When we took the tour with Ceri, he put those fears to rest by teaching us some basic street smarts and giving us a sense of the city's vibe. We learned how to spot fake money, got around on the subway, and took quick trips to many different sites and neighborhoods - sort of like a 'sampler platter' of things to do. Ceri was also able to answer any question thrown at him, whether it was places to eat or where the great day trips outside the city are. I went by myself, but there were plenty of couples and a cruise ship group along with us, and we made a fun group. No matter what your plans are, spending a half day on this tour will make you much more comfortable in the city, give you new ideas, and answer any questions so you can really dive in. Plus, with it being 'pay what you want', the value is through the roof!Go for it. Highly recommended."

You can expect a friendly, funny, and knowledgeable tour guide who will show you around and give you advice on money exchange, restaurants, and tango places, as well empart his knowledge on the important historical events of the country. But what you wouldn't expect from a tour guide is for him to go out of his way to help you out in a luggage situation at the airport, which is what Ceri did for us, and it was greatly appreciated. His philosophy on how to treat people was spot on and because we followed his advice to be friendly and respectful to the people we met, we found the Porte\u00f1os to be very genuine and friendly. I will definitely take another tour with Ceri if I get the chance to return to BsAs some day."

There were only 7 of us on the tour which was a nice change from other free tours. We spent some time in the cafe talking to the guide and each other and asking questions. We then sauntered around the city taking in some cool places including a historic pharmacy, the palacio barolo and carousels. This was a tour by a local sharing what life was like in BA. It was not a rushed tick box of sight seeing. We really enjoyed this tour and the participants contributed to a fun atmosphere however the humour might not be to everyone's taste."

We walked through many kinds of neighborhoods, took a bus to San Telmo another neighborhood. We went in and out of grocery stores, liquor stores, pharmacies (they always had a green cross out front). We sat in a plaza area and had a grapefruit soda and watched a flamenco demonstration which are common around the city.

Returning to Buenos Aires for another short visit, on my way to Ushuaia, meant that I had already visited most of the key tourist spots so I was looking to do something different this time. I had failed to visit La Boca on previous visits and a custom tour with a local guide seemed the ideal opportunity to have a more in depth exploration of the area and get off the beaten track without getting into trouble. On explaining what I was looking for, a photography focused custom tour involving the La Boca district, I was told that it would be no problem as they had a professional photographer (Richard) on staff and he conducted photography tours plus he was available on the only day I had to spare. As I wasn\u2019t sure if jet lag would be a problem I arranged for a five hour afternoon tour of La Boca and left it to Richard to organise the details.After meeting at Fundacion Proa we brushed shoulders with the tourists at the \u201csights\u201d before heading off into the actual neighbourhood where we didn\u2019t see another tourist and finding the real gems, such as the La Boca volunteer fire department where we were invited into the station to have a look around and talk to the fire fighters, and then to an interesting local market for a refreshment stop before having an amusing encounter with some street performers. All in all a pleasant afternoon having fun with a great guide and highly recommended."

Some I can\u2019t remember. Some I don\u2019t want to remember. Traveling solo with marginal Spanish is challenging and one lesson learned is you must go with the flow of how things work in a particular country. This is difficult for many foreigners, especially Americans, but it\u2019s the only way to maintain your sanity. However, you do need the help of a good tour company!Buenos Aires Local Tours (http://www.buenosaireslocaltours.com/) has undoubtedly made the month I'm spending in Buenos Aires easier. They are the best local tour group I\u2019ve interacted with on this trip. My contacts - Penelope and Jonathan - had excellent written English skills, responded to my e-mailed questions thoroughly, and always followed-up. Buenos Aires is a big city with many attractions and activities. The initial information Penelope e-mailed helped me get around and plan my time wisely to experience the parts of the city of most interest.The city tour with Ceri was fantastic \u2013 so much information and we went to parts of the Buenos Aires removed from the normal tourist crowd. Ceri was fun and his commentary was educational and helpful in understanding Buenos Aires, one of my favorite cities. The tour was thoroughly enjoyable!I recommend Buenos Aires Tours to anyone visiting the city, especially for the first time. They are extremely competent and organized and will help you navigate the city, take you to special areas of interest, and provide essential information required to organize your time well while visiting one of the world\u2019s most fantastic cities!"

I thought the walking tour would give a good overview of the city and hit the highlights, which was all we had time for. This worked out well for us. This company offers free walking tours where you pay in tips what you feel is appropriate. You do need to sign up ahead of time on-line so they have a head count. This helps to keep the groups small. You will receive a follow-up e-mail with the name and photo of the meeting point, as well as the name and photo of your guide. We landed in Buenos Aires at 4:30 am on a Monday and after a quick rest we were able to locate the Puerto Rico Cafe described in the e-mail. Our guide, Ceri, is a Canadian/UK transplant who has lived in BA for 7 years. He took our group of about a dozen people on a tour of Plaza de Mayo, where he gave historical background near the Pink House, famous for the balcony used by Evita Peron. We saw the cathedral and went back in later on our own--beautiful and worth doing! Outside does not look like much but the inside was very European-cathedral looking.Ceri's tours focus on making you feel comfortable with BA, so he took us on a bus and subway. He also took us to change money at a street newstand, where you get a better exchange rate. I have to say that was kind of creepy, though--seemed like we were doing something underhanded behind a curtain. Anyway, all was fine. Ceri was very entertaining and we enjoyed the experience. We finished up near the kiosk about 1:45 pm.I will say we did not see a LOT of BA on this tour, as this company's focus is helping you feel comfortable navigating public transportation, etc. We went on a different walking tour the next day (see separate entry) where we saw more of the city. Both have their positives and negatives.If you have time, this is a pleasant way to spend a morning."

Many of them are usual common sense when one travels in a foreign city, but many were specific to the area and were very helpful. The group was fairly large that morning, with a few extras showing up, so we did not take the bus or the subway. We did walk around Plaza de Mayo and down toward Congress, and he showed us some very special buildings we would not have known on our own. We stopped for a money changer which we did not need, but if anyone needs to change money here, it's best to have some recommendation.We got lots of little details and some interesting insights into the customs and history. All in all, it was a morning very well spent.

Our tour was at a nice easy pace, with stops for coffee, the pharmacy, money changer and more. He was very knowledgeable. He recommended La Brigada for lunch at San Telmos. We were a bit skeptical because the neighborhood didn't seem very appealing. We were not disappointed, the steak melts in your mouth. The best we've ever had. Also the wine he recommended, was beautiful. We saw so much, learnt so much and had a great time. We felt safe and well looked after. If you are deciding on a walking tour, don't hesitate. You'll have a great time."

We pre booked the tour as there is a limit of people on each tour. He helped us to exchange money and educated us about counterfeit money. Our 3 hour tour allowed us to visit Cafe Tortoni, learned about the history of Casa Rosada and visit Basilica del Santisimo Sacramento. Our walk also allowed us to appreciate the various architecture around the city. This Pay as you go tour allows you to choose your payment. I highly recommend you book this tour on your first day in Buenos Aires."

Oliver grew up in California and we're from the US so communication was not a problem. He met us at the port and took us to get cabs where they don't charge the inflated rate at the port. We walked the streets of La Boca while Oliver talked about football, early immigrants and the Tango. From there we caught a bus to San Telmo where we saw an entirely different type of neighborhood. He found us a great place for lunch where we had pizza unlike what we get in the states. From there we went to Plaza de Mayo where Oliver talked about the pope, Evita and the 20th century politics of Argentina. The next day we met Oliver at one of our hotels and took cabs to the Abasto neighborhood where we saw and heard about Carlos Gardel, the father of Tango. We then took a subway to Plaza San Martin and saw the mansions of the wealthy at the beginning of the 20th century. He took us to an empanada restaurant for lunch. We finished the day at the Recoleta cemetery where Oliver told us at least a dozen stories about people buried there including Evita. It was a lot of walking but a great way to see the city. I never would have tried the subway without a tour guide. Oliver is very engaging, extremely knowledgable and a great story teller. I highly recommend him."

Ceri, our tour guide, is a professional at caring for his city and his people. As he says \"I treat you as I want to be toured\" and he does not disappoint. The only disappointment is when it is over. We plan on signing up with him again this week because he personalizes each and every tour - You learn practical information to be safe, you learn reasonable places to see Tango, you learn history, you laugh, you truly have a great time with Ceri. Do not visit Buenos Aires without having this experience."

The tour gave us some ideas for other places to explore in more detail over the coming days."

He answered me all the questions I had and I did have a good time.He did show me a kosher mc donalds, went with me in a tango shoe shop and gave me insider tipps on what to do. Even though I can't compare it to a \"normal\" tour with other people, I enjoyed it a lot and I really can recommend doing it.

Fast reply on the email, very friendly text and with a designated guide (Ceri) and lots of recommendations of what to see in the city, incl links to other sites. We met our guide at 10am, and were happy to see that our group consisted of only 4 people! Almost like a private tour, and our guide, Ceri, let us take part in the decision where to go/what to see. Ceri has lots of knowledge of both Buenos Aires and Argentina - history, architecture, policy, economy, etc, and we learned a lot in 3-4 hours. We wandered around in the city centre, but also went with the underground and the bus to other neighbourhoods. I highly recommend this tour, in particular when you are so lucky to be in a small group!"

Funny, engaging, knowledgable, super-helpful and informative. He took took to engage with us all & the result was 3 hours of great insight and a lot of laughing. Useful intel - the bus system is not that easy to navigate but Ceri equipped us with the know how to use it, and the Subte, simply. Social, political & economic content- we could schlep around the key sights ourselves but having someone bring them to life with relevant content & context made it far more valuable. Unusual/unseen gems - BA is a big place & you don't always get time to gawp at the less obvious bits. Having someone lead you to (and inside) stunning buildings is a big advantageCan't recommend enough"

I like that we took some transportation (bus\\subway) to do it because it made me feel a bit like a resident.The spots that they show are very good as well and Ceri always try to show something surprising about them. He also showed a good expertise in the way that he managed the tour and a heterogeneous group of people."

A great combination of history, sight seeing and handy tips of how to navigate and get a grip of the various transport systems, I felt it covered everything I wanted to know and more. The pace was perfect and not too rushed. Jonathan certainly knew his stuff and was always happy to answer any question. He also sends a really great email full of suggestions afterwards. I recommended this tour to pretty much everyone I met out in BA and would definitely suggest it to anyone planning on visiting this incredible city."

Jess was a great guide and we learned so much about how to get around the city on public transport (incredibly cheap) as well as seeing some things that I doubt we ever would have without her. By the time the tour was over we had a really good idea of what else we should see in BA as well as how best to get there. The Masters golf was on while we were there and during our tour someone asked which bars might be showing it on tv. Jess wasn't sure but by the time we got back to the hotel there was an e mail waiting for us telling where we could see it. She also left us contact details for if we had any other queries whilst out n about in the city ( which, by the way, we loved). She didn't have to do either of these things but just seemed to genuinely love this city and wanted us to enjoy it too. So, go on, take the tour ( which is free, you just pay what you think when it's over) and don't be stingy with the cash at the end!!"

I turned up for this free walking tour expecting a brief overview of the city and it's sights, but ended up getting a brilliant, detailed private tour with Oliver. We started near Palermo and took both the bus and Subte all over town which was a good introduction to the city's transport. Stopping for lunch in Abasto we then went on to see some of the most beautiful and historically important sights in Buenos Aires, ending at the Casa Rosada in Plaza de Mayo. Oliver was charming and full of knowledge throughout the tour, and being an actor he had very clear diction and lots of humour in his delivery. I imagine this is why his tour is very popular with private group tours too. I would highly recommend you take his tour as an introduction to this amazing city."

Although taxis are not expensive, getting around during the gridlock of rush hour is a bonus. Thank you Jonathan!"

Jonathan was interesting, knowledgeable and relevant. After the tour, our random group of tourists hired him for an additional two hours of touring. Taking the bus and subway was another way to experience B.A. authentically.A must tour at the beginning of your visit to Buenos Aires."

I recommend you take it at the beginning of your visit to get some good tips, see the top landmarks (casa rosada, congress, palacio barolo, and the area around Gardel's museum) + it is FREE...just leave a tip at the end. Note, you will need to take a bus and the subte (metro) so have coins and cash handy."

He is extremely knowledgeable about the history of B.A. and has an excellent sense of humour. He is also amazingly conscientious and makes you feel he really cares: the following day after the tour, we received an email from him containing a bunch of websites of other places which we had asked about. He also told us to email him if we had any questions. Thank you so much Jonathan!Don't miss the local tour with Jonathan, it really is a must!D & D from Toronto, Canada"

The day starts 11am (still get to sleep in) at the Italian square meeting point which is very centrally located to most of the popular areas. You meet Jonathan and he explains the day and most importantly the essentials of the public transport system: Bus (Which in BA can be complex unless someone explains it to you) and metro (pretty straight forward if you have used other metro around the world).Sites: Jonathan first took us to the area where Carlos Gardel lived and now is a museum dedicated to him. You then have lunch at the oldest meat market in BA which is now a beautiful air con shopping centre but the building has been kept the same. You then head to see more popular buildings but most importantly for me was the Pink house where Evita famously sung to her people.As mentioned on previous post there is no pressure from Jonathan to tip and he is very informative of the history of BA and answers all questions.I highly recommend doing the tour on your first day as it teaches you the basics of the city."

He starts his tour covering some of the basics of the public transportation in Buenos Aires. Buses and the subway are used to get around during his tour so it makes sense, but also makes getting around the city easier for the rest of your stay. During the tour he gives lots of back stories about the places you are seeing and leaves you with plenty of ideas for places to back and see more in depth later. While you are walking around you have plenty of time to talk to the other tourists (10 in our group) and the guide to find out what he and they recommend.It was very hot during our tour and Jonathan made sure to keep to the shade and offer water breaks when they were needed. It's a small thing you want to expect, but don't always get. He also will send an email with recommendations for restaurants, tango shows, day trips, etc after the tour. Definitely a 5 star free walking tour, make 4 hours to head out and learn about Buenos Aires soon after your arrival."

We found it a useful way to spend our first day in Buenos Aires - it gave us an appreciation of the public transportation (especially the bus) and the orientation of the city. Jonathan couldn't have been friendlier and answered all of our questions about the city! We went to an area that we couldn't have gone to on our own - but gained an understanding of Carlos Gardel, Tango in BA, and street art in BA. And very much enjoyed ourselves!! The tour is relaxed, very casual - our group was around 10, very friendly, and Jonathan escorted us efficiently through the city. Our tour was 4 1/2 hours. There was a lunch break half way through with a bathroom break. We found Jonathan right away - it was nice to meet in Palermo since that is where we were staying. We ended downtown near the Casa Rosada - which was an easy place to continue to venture around the city for a few more hours. Only complaint - wish there was a little more walking down the Calle de Mayo rather than taking the subway 2x! Jonathan sent out a helpful email after the tour with good restaurants to eat at, Tango shows to attend, and other tours to take.Highly recommend!!"

I can only repeat all the good things I had read about it before.It's not only about the places you visit (some you might not think to go to on your own), but also all the useful information Jonathan shares, not without a certain (brit!) sense of humor. He takes the time to talk with all the people attending the tour (and we were a big goup that day!) to understand better their expectations and give the best recommendations.I would also highly recommend his recoleta cemetary tour, full of great stories!Don't think twice, go meet Jonathan!"

Everything that I can say have already been written in the earlier reviews, but once again - this really is an awesome tour, one of the best free walking tours I have ever attended (and I attended many). I feel like this city walk has been a solid foundation to exploring Buenos Aires further. No matter if your stay here is going to be short or long - take the tour and you either get nice idea where you wanna have a closer look next days, or, if you are leaving soon, you get a nice overview of the most important landmarks. Jonathan is a great guide, you will get tons of information about Buenos Aires and Argentina, their history, culture, politics, ... and also great practical hints! It's like a mine of information - seems that you can ask any questions and get the answer :) Thanks to Jonathan for a very nice afternoon in the city - sure I will recommend this tour to anyone who is visiting BsAs!"

We can easily imagine his free tour to be way superior to conventional paid tours that are impersonal and over commercialized. Highly recommended!"

My friend and I had heard about this \"tour given by an ex-pat Brit that starts at the Plaza Italia that starts everyday at 11am\" from other American tourists. Jonathan came highly recommended and we weren't disappointed. The day of our particular tour it was overcast. When only 2 other tourists showed up for the tour we were fearful he might cancel but we were not disappointed. In fact, our tour was even more personal because of the small size. Jonathan patiently answered all of our questions. He also followed up with excellent recommendations and suggestions afterwards that were tailored specifically to us after he had gotten to know us throughout the day. I especially liked the stop at Carlos Gardel's house and lunch in Abasto. Who knew? I would have felt like such an idiot if I returned to the US without knowing about Carlos Gardel. Jonathan's patient advice on how to use the Buenos Aires metro and bus was especially useful for anyone planning on spending more than a few days in BA. An excellent tour."

We first did the private tour (recoleta- cemetery) and free tour in 1 day. I can really say that there is no way we would have seen (as well as found- we have map reading issues! HAHA) all the attractions we needed to see here. He is filled with a wealth of knowledge on the culture and history of Buenos aires, it is seriously impressive! I can promise you will not be disappointed with his service as it goes way beyond the call of duty (yes he does email really quickly, gives a list of things to do after the visit and you can always use him for more questions at a later stage during your trip.) He was so good that we did another private tour of the boca area. Once again without having read tons on the area, he gave us a mini history class in the space of 1.5 hours! Priceless really!!!

I was staying in Palermo Soho, and even though I am a really good walker, it was just too far to walk all the time from my hotel. This tour gives you the skills and the confidence to use public transit in Buenos Aires, primarily the subway. While it is not as nice as the subway in other cities, is a very efficient way to get around. Another benefit of the tour is you learn quite a bit about the city, and it give you much more context for your visit. I enjoyed seeing the Abasto neightborhood, and its colorful murals and art deco shopping center. I doubt I would have seen this on my own. I also liked the fact that the tour ended at the Plaza de Mayo. Since it was a Thursday afternoon, I got to the see the Madres demonstration, which was one of the most moving sights I saw in Buenos Aires. Jonathan was a great guide. The only thing I would improve on the tour is to skip the last subway ride, which was very short and walk down Ave de Mayo instead. Otherwise it was perfect and highly recommend."

The tour sites are well chosen and varied, offering a snapshot of various suburbs. Johnathon's calm and natural demeanor allow you to tramp around like an honorary local, jumping on and off buses and subway systems and providing detailed descriptions of all cultural and historic sites. At 4 hours this tour is manageable without the usual tour guide overkill. Highly recommended, we will take on the pub quiz next time!"

I say riding because Jonathan teaches you how to ride the bus and the subway which will make your trip much more affordable if you need to travel throughout the city. Also the taxi cab rides can be quite an interesting experience. Kind of like Mr Toads wild ride on steroids!! We took an additional tour from Jonathan to Recoleta cemetery and were very happy we did or we would have never learned so much about all the symbolism on the tombs.

He is orginally from Britain but has lived in B.A. for some years, which makes for a really nice mix of (obviously) really good English, a fact and story-filled tour and a more unbiased view on the city and its people. Jonathan could answer all our questions, even the really random ones and tailored the tour a bit for us too. We liked him so much we hired him for a tour in Recoleta as well!"

Jonathan knows BA like the back of his hand and went beyond the surface to provide an indepth guided experience. The guy is like the Rick Steves of Buenos Aires. He instinctively knows what visitors are really going to value and maximizes your time by getting you from point to point creatively. I'm definitely recommending Jonathan and this tour to anyone that has an interest getting off those big yellow buses and on to one with a bit of fileteado."

Jonathan gave a quick brief of BA's history and a good orientation of the city. Jon is very knowledgeable esp since he has only been in BA for a number of years. Besides, taking us to various sites, he taught us how to take the buses and subway, which is so useful since the sites in ba are pretty dispersed. He also gave a host of recommendations, the only pity was that we didn't have enough time to experience more of them. I'd recommend this tour to anyone who is time-pressed and need a quick download of the city! And big thank u to Jon"

I was in BA for a few days and decided that a walking tour would be a great option to get to know areas that I wasn't staying in - when I read the TA reviews, this sounded perfect. I was the only one who turned up on the day but it was better this way - Jonathan asked me if I'd prefer to go to Recoleta cemetery instead of his usual Abasta tour and I was happy to go with the cemetery option as I'd read about it, but not really wanted to go on my own. He was really knowledgeable about not only the cemetery, but also gave some great advice on getting around on buses and the metro and even food options. Definitely recommend if you visit BA!"

Jonathan teaches you how to use the mass transportation system, the bus and subway, which is quite challenging to be sure. I would have to say the system itself is wonderful but understanding it is not very intuitive. Do yourself a huge favor and take this walking tour before you do anything else. Your visit will be much enhanced. I almost forgot to mention that during this 4 hour tour you go all over town and see many interesting sites and get a lot of interesting facts and history especially regarding Carlos Gardel and Gauchito Gil whom I have never heard of until the tour. He also spoke about the Peron\u2019s, Evita and her husband Juan the former Argentinian President, who had a huge historical impact on BA."

It was done on May 7 and May is considered low season. We were four tourists, 3 from Canada and one from France. Our tour guide is Jonathan, an Englishman who has lived in Buenos Aires for several years. He started by explaining how the bus system works. He showed a map showing the bus routes and how to read it. This can be purchased in any magazine kiosk for about AD$10. Very helpful if you plan to use the bus to get around the city. Bus ride is about AD$3.00 for any distance you travel. He also showed how to use the subte (subway). This is even cheaper than the bus, charging only AD$2.50 per ride.Jonathan showed us some landmarks with accompanying anecdotes. They were very amusing. He gave us some insight on the culture and mores of the people. He was very patient in explaining things and spent more time than the usual 4 hours. We saw places and buildings that we wouldn't have known in our short stay in Buenos Aires. This tour is one of the highlights of our trip. Worth taking. A generous tip is also much appreciated."

We met Jonathan for the Saturday tour and were amazed all the things we learned in saw in such a short amount of time. We enjoyed the tour so much on Saturday with the group that we hired Jonathan for Sunday to show us around Recoleta, La Boca, and San Telmo. Wow! Best money I have ever spent. Walking through Recoleta is a must for any visitor, but what makes it better is having someone to share the history, explain the key tombs, and guide you through the cemetary. Then, the trip to La Boca was certainly much easier with a guide to ensure you navigate in and out of the area without issue. If you are only in the city for a few days, make sure you leverage Jonathan for the private tour. You won't be disappointed."

Coming off of two non stop days of flights and touring we didnt want to stress ourselves out too much in Buenos Aires so there was no tour or itinerary for stay there. A day before the tour I saw it in tripadvisor cities (excellent iphone app btw). I'm sure they do these kinds of tours all the time but i'm not really big on tours and tour guides so to hear of a 'free' tour was something new to me. Arrived a few minutes late to meet up location where Jonathon was awaiting us. I expected there to be more people but fortunately for us it was just us. I asked Jonathan and he said his tours can be anywhere from 2-20 people i believe with the average being around 10. This is key to note that everyone's tour can be vastly different from the others. In some aspects Jonathan remained very professional and composed which is good in a sense because it reminds you that you ARE on a tour. However, there were aspects that didnt feel pre-rehearsed or forced. These were my favourite parts because thats when it didnt feel like a tour, but justa friend walking me around an unfamiliar city. My only criticism, if any, would be for the tour to be a little bit more like this unstructured, but i understand the restraints and why this cant always be so.That being said we did diverge from the regular tour and went to Recoleta Cemetry. We also got to see the only Kosher Mcdonalds and house of Carlos Gardel. Jonathan was able to answer every question we threw at him, although i dont think we are the most inquisitve people. He def. knows his geography and knowledge. All in all, if you have 4 hours to spare then there isnt any reason not to go on this tour and get a more local experience of BA. Also remember tip well as its a 'free' tour!"

Johnathon also provides lots of information on how to navigate the city, use the buses, taxis and the underground plus warns you of many of the scams and dangers Not only do you learn lots of Argentinas history, but also get to appreciate the beautiful buildings, the culture and the people. We had 6 days in BA and did this tour on day 3. I regret not going with Johnathon on day one would have known so much more and felt much safer. Thank you Johnathon, best tour we have done yet."

A fabulous introduction to neighborhoods we wouldn't have otherwise seen - as well as tourist landmarks such as the congress and the Casa Rosada. Just as welcome, he introduced us to the buses and the subway- making us comfortable enough with the subway, at least, to ride it happily on our own. Great storyteller and all around good guy. Our seven year old son, who loves a good tour, said this was the best ever."

Jonathan's four-hour tour is a fantastic introduction to Buenos Aires - packed with information and designed to instill confidence in first-time visitors trying to navigate the city. As a woman exploring Buenos Aires on her own, I found his practical tips on public transport and crime prevention particularly invaluable. And being English, Jonathan brings a particular brand of dry wit to the tour, that makes historical fact and legend more memorable: \"edutainment\" at its best (though that word would make him cringe). Five stars, two thumbs up, 10/10, full marks."

            "review": "Get around like a local. After reading the reviews for Jonathan's tour, I decided to book the tour for 18 January. Once the group assembled at Plaza Italia, Jonathan explained that we'd be using local transportation to get around the city. He also explained how to decipher the \"Guida T\" (bus guide) to find a proper bus route and that the buses only take coins. I suffered a brief panic when I realized I had no coins; however, Jonathan quickly relieved the panic by offering to exchange paper for coins.Once everyone in the group had the proper coinage our tour commenced by queueing for the bus (the locals are very serious about queueing) and subsequently riding the bus to the home of the face of Tango -- Carlos Gardel -- in the Abasto district. After learning about Carlos and his various exploits we had a short break for lunch at the Abasto indoor shopping mall, formerly the Buenos Aires central market.From there we traveled by subway to congressional plaza. The trip didn't require coins since there were attendants on hand to make change. After learning about Kilometer Zero and other Buenos Aires history we walked down Avienda de Mayo (pronounced \"MAH sho\" Jonathan explained) to Casa Rosada, the offices of the executive branch of the Argentinian government. Along the way we passed several points of interest, including a reference to Dante's Inferno, Cafe Tortoni, and ultimately the symbols of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo.For anyone wanting to know how to get around Buenos Aires like a local and absorbing some Argentinian history along the way, one would be well informed by taking this tour.A few hints if you take the tour:* Have $2 and $1 pesos on hand for the bus* If you must carry a bag, carry an old one.* If you carry a bag, keep it in front of you when riding public transit.* I never felt unsafe while on the tour, but be vigilant. As Jonathan told us: \"a little paranoia goes a long way\""

I cannot rate this experience highly enough. My only problem was that we did not do this sooner into our stay!He was a wealth of knowledge but not one second was boring, stuffy or dull - the whole tour showed not only how much Jonathan obviously loves this incredible city - despite it's sometimes-madness! - but also how interesting and quirky Buenos Aires itself is.We had a great time riding on the buses with the locals, learning the minutiae of what makes the city so unique, and talking about Porteno life, politics and culture. Definitely the best way to experience a city is to hang out with a local, albeit an adopted one, so your sightseeing isn't aimless. There is too much to do and learn in Buenos Aires to go into it with no clue, and the Congreso means so much more when you also get to hear the story of the over the top windmill cafe next to it. He was also extremely patient with my irritating shutterbug habit. If you do only one thing in Buenos Aires on your visit here, make sure this is it. Thanks again so much Jonathan!!!"

The reason I enjoyed Jonathan's tour more than most was because he gave a good introduction to the public transportation system, which can definitely be intimidating in a city like Buenos Aires. Also, his tour was more detailed than most of the other tours we tried, meaning that you didn't just \"brush\" over everything. I would recommend this tour to first time visitors as a great way to start your travels."

Jonathan Evans is a wonderful tour guide who has great knowledge coupled with a sense of humor which made our four hour toura not to be missed experience. I advise everyone to start with this tour because you will use public transportation, which is a mustin this large city, and Jonathan teaches you the basics. It is obvious that he loves the history of BA and passes it on very well. My husband and I were very glad to have started our adventure in BA with this tour! Highly recommended."

As part of the tour Johnathan not only tells you about the transport system but he also demonstrates! We took the subte and the metro - this was so benefical as he taught us how to pay/ ask for our ticket etc. We able to use this transport when required throughout the rest of our trip (which we would definitely not have been comfortable doing prior to his tutorial!). Johnathan brought us to several of the major sights as well as lesser known neighbourhoods - I particularly loved the area around the Tango Singer Carlos Gardels house as the wall art was so colourful and it was great to visit such authentic areas. (See photos uploaded which I took on tour)Johnathan was friendly and interesting throughout the tour. His stories were entertaining and really informative.We expressed interest in attending a sold out Las Pumas vs All Blacks that was taking a place a couple of days later - Johnathan very kindly offered to arrange to source tickets for us and he followed up on this offer promptly the next day. He also emailed us a list of his recommendations i.e restaurants/coffee shops etc. Thank you Johnathan for your help and advice!The payment for this tour is via a tip at the end - which is much deserved for the time dedicated to the tours on a daily basis."

I am a very experienced solo traveler- have been to over 100 countries, taken lots and lots of tours of different cities and locations. This was definitely one of the best if not THE best. Jonathan is incredible. British guy, living in BA for more than 4-5 years. Smart as hell. Has all the qualities for a perfect guide. First- knowledge. Since I am very much interested in the history of spain-europe-indiginous people-Argentina, during the tour I asked him tens and tens of questions. His fund of knowledge is amazing. There was not one thing he didn't know and couldn't elaborate on in a very detailed way.But that's not the only thing that makes him a good guide. Jonathan has a sharp and special kind of sense of humor. He also is a master in telling fascinating stories. this combo is a great one: prepare to laugh and enjoy numerous anecdotes and stories about the city.Also- this is not going to be a tour only of the \"pink house\", \"Eva Peron cemetary\" etc. He will take you to hidden gems in the city- that no other tour will take you too.And By the way- I was in BA for a wedding of a good friend. My boss took the tour too, a day prior, and he absolutely loved it! I really think that a visit in BA is not going to be the same without Jonathans tour. You will learn so much about Argenina- and in such an amusing, fun and interesting way!!By the way- this is what Jonathan does. He does not charge money but bascially living on tips- so if you like it, be generous with him.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!Yair"

Unique because Jonathan is both a local, with a deep knowledge and experience of Buenos Aires, and a foreigner who is able to talk about the Argentinian culture and customs from an outsider point of view that makes sense to other foreigners. We did a Tango tour (Abasto) and visited Plaza de Mayo and other places in a tour that took about 4 hours. The group was small (5 people) and there was an intellectually stimulating, fun and friendly atmosphere all around. We asked Jonathan a lot of questions about Argentinian history and culture, and he was not only willing but also very interested to take the conversation to whatever direction we wanted, providing thoughtful, knowledgable comments. It is a pleasure to interact with such an educated and fun person as Jonathan and a great luck to have him as a tour guide!"

Check the website buenosaireslocaltours.com just in case, but in principle go to the steps within Plaza Italia. Easy via subte green line D. At 11am Jonathan will be waiting for you. Jonathan takes a very practical approach - by the end of his tour you will know how to get round the city by understanding addresses/distances on a map, the bus system and the metro/subte. This learning is included as part of a very interesting walk that included Carlos Gardel, Abasto, a colectivo public bus, the A line wooden metro car, Congresso, Casa de Rosado and a lot more including the most superb explanation of Palacio Barolo - Jonathan knows his stuff. All this is delivered with an obvious passion for the subject, tinged with humour and a hint of sadness as demonstrated when he accurately described the Windmill Building next to Congress as being a snapshot of recent Argentinian history. Rich, opulent, political, poor, neglected, waiting for the next chapter. A very good analogy. The walk was well paced and even though the duration was four hours there was never a moment when we were bored. In addition to the walk, you can also tap Jonathans local knowledge which is extensive. We asked for some additional information which was not to hand on the day but was delivered by email within 24 hours. This is billed as a \"free tour\" but we defy you to walk away giving nothing. We willingly gave our tip - reckon it was excellent value"

I was wanting to see the Palermo section of the city, and when his tour said the meeting point was in Palermo, near Plaza Italia I said \"sign me up\". When my friend and I got there and Jonathan said he was going to take us back towards the direction we came from, I wanted to leave since it seemed like it was just going to be a redo of everything else I had already seen. However, I decided to give him a chance since the group was very small and it would have been noticeable if we had bailed. He gave a great explanation of the bus system, which is very confusing - they publish a book to find your way around - and he gave clear directions on what to do when you get on the buses. The first stop we made was in the Abasto area, where we saw lots of tango related businesses and landmarks. With this stop alone I was happy that we had not left the group back at Plaza Italia. I would never have known about this area of the city if it werent for Jonathan's tour. For a non-Argentinian he had a great amount of knowledge of the buildings and city, even to the point that he told us new information about buildings we had already seen. We did not finish the whole tour with him because we had to be somewhere before the tour was over, but Jonathan was very helpful in giving us directions back to where we needed to be. He was super pleasant and interesting to talk to when we riding the buses. Even though we missed the end of the tour with him, we will definitely take his advice and ride the A line to see the wooden train cars."

One with his sports writer friend and another to a big game that many agencies were not offering tickets to. Score!We really appreciate the contribution Jonathan made to making our trip fantastic!"

We heard about Jonathan's tours towards the end of our stay in Argentina, via the best posible source - a word of mouth recommendation.Out tour took place on an overcast day (good for strolling round, B A can get HOT) and Jonathan's passion for the city he had made his own is evident. He has a real talent for imparting knowledge and what seems to be an endless supply of anecdotes...all interesting and relevant, even the ones about the buses and subte. He saves what I thought to be the best until almost the end, it's diabolical...that should whet your appetite!The tour is free, but be realistic with your tip at the end...whilst he enjoys running these tours you are getting four hours of his experience and guidance and - as he states in his website - he does like steaks and malbec!"

He's down to earth and has been there before (not speaking Spanish and trying to get around.)

He took us to some of the key sights like Abasto - to see the amazing buildings and learn about Carol Gardel, then to the La Plaza de Congreso and the 1930s wooden subway train is like something out of Back to the Future! He speaks several languages (although English was the most useful for me!) and has a remarkable memory for details, dates, facts and figures which brings the buildings and stories to life. All in all an excellent tour. Next time I'm in BA I'll probably do one of his custom tours."

Although Jonathan is British rather than Argentinian, he obviously has a passion for Argentina and its capital city. He is knowlegeable on historical sites and the ride on buses and subway (a wooden train built in the 1930's) was fun. Learning how to get about by public transport proved to be extremely useful for us as we explored Buenos Aires on our own in the next few days. Eventually we even managed to get to the Tigre Delta area by train (a one-hour ride from Retiro) and returned for just 2.5 pesos per person!We thoroughly enjoyed the tour of Abasto area where we get to know more about Carlos Gardel, the Tango King. The route has a good mix of cultural and historical sites. We had done another free city tour (by another company) the evening before and it's good that the two trips basically had very few overlapping sites. For us from Hong Kong who do not speak Spanish, Jonathan's English is easy to understand, and through his introduction, we get a feel of how expats see Argentina.Great job, Jonathan, and thanks!Mym and KM Leungfrom Hong Kong"

My girlfriend is a Portenio and she managed to learn more from Jonathan (About her home city) than she had learned in years of living there!!!

This is one excursion you don't want to miss. To be honest the word \"free\" first attracted my attention to this tour.

You'll use mass transit (bus/subway), learn how it works so you can navigate/travel the city, visit slightly off the beaten path tourist destinations and best of all you'll spend time with a fellow who clearly loves his adopted city. And, frankly, in some ways, I think an expat can provide more nuanced information/explanation of a place than a local tour company. I know that sounds a little off but really...an expat can relate much better to a tourist's common questions/concerns/misunderstandings than a local because he probably struggled with the same issues. I did two free tours while in the city and the level of information/insight that I received from Jonathan far exceeded that from the other tour. He is a friendly, smart, and interesting fellow who's a fantastic travel resource. This was an all-around great experience."

I learned how to take the bus and the subte which was very helpful. He also takes you to area in BA that are over looked by the major tour groups. I highly recommend this tour."

He answered every question (appropriately he's also the host of the Monday night Pub Quiz at Le Cigale -it's in English, btw and it rocks!) and he even deciphered the transit systems (we rode the bus and train like locals!)With his insight, I had so much more reverence for the Mothers of the Disappeared as they marched around the Plaza de Mayo. And how else would I have known the real story behind Madonna being filmed on the balcony of the Casa Rosada for EVITA?If you're going, try to take this tour during the start of your stay so you can make the most of it -we relied on his recommendations (museums, restaurants, shopping) for the rest of our trip! Amazingly, this tour is free, Jonathan does it for tips, but how could you NOT tip after getting so much inside information? Gracias, Jonathan! Abrazo grande!"

Jonathan's tour was incredibly enjoyable because it went off the beaten path usually covered by generic \"touristy\" tours, and covered interesting nooks and crannies that reveal the city's true soul and essence. The \"back story\" about Buenos Aires that I learned from him really helped me to understand the place in a way that conventional tours just can't. I also really enjoyed learning how to use public transport (bus, subway), very practical for the rest of the trip but also a lot of fun, not sure I would've ventured into that territory on my own. Highly recommended!"

We took other free walking tours and a bike tour in addition to this tour and I'd recommend all of them, but on this tour we learned how to use the buses which made all the difference in our stay in Buenos Aires. Jonathan, our guide, explained how to use the GuiaT (the bus riders' bible) to get from any spot in the city to another, as well as how and where to get the buses. We also used the subway which is easy, inexpensive (about .25 a ride), and fast. Jonathan took us to El Abasto (see the only kosher McDonalds outside of Israel), and to the Carlos Gardel house and museum which weren't on any of the other tours. The tour lasted about 3 hours including time for a quick lunch. The tour is free but I think most of us tipped Jonathan about 50 pesos."

He is relaxed and friendly and provided a really easy introduction to BA. We would definitely recommend taking his walking tour soon after arriving in BA, as he shows you practical things like how to take the local buses (confusing) and subte (easy). He also takes you through more 'local' type neighbourhoods that you may well not visit otherwise. The tour ends in Plaza de Mayo, so you can head off and explore further after it ends. Jonathan can give all sorts of practical advice regarding where to go, places to eat etc. A very worthwhile day, far better than stumbling around with a guide book if you're newly arrived. Tip at the end whatever you wish."

Jonathan is a wealth of knowledge for an outsider. The tour started in Plaza Italia in the Palermo section of Buenos Aires. The tour includes everything Jonathan advertises, taking the buses (colectivos), the subte (the subway) and lots of walking in the \"non\" traditional sections of Buenos Aires. This is a big city so don't think you are going to see everything in a few days. It was lots of fun and I learned a lot from Jonathan."

My wife and I booked a \"free\" walking tour after Googling the site at www.buenosaireslocaltours.com The tours run daily (except Sunday) at 11am from Plaza Italia in Palermo. We had an truly excellent day. Our guide, Jonathan, is a British ex-pat with a deep knowledge of the city and its history. He relies on voluntary donations at the end of his 3-3 1/2 hour tour and there is no hard sell. He's a truly nice guy and loves what he's doing. For the record, we gave him 100 pesos each (US$25/person) as that is what we had been charged the previous day by another tour company. It was worth every penny and then some.Jonathan differentiates himself in two ways: first, he takes you to interesting places ignored by the guide books and bigger companies and, second, he includes two trips on the collectivos (local buses) and one trip on the Subte (subway). That introduction to, and explanation of, the B.A. transit system is, by itself, worth the tour. Just show up; you won't be disappointed."

As previously mentioned by another reviewer, while it's free to go on the 4 hour tour, you should tip the guy. He like us travels, and that requires money ;)Anyway, why would I not tip given his advice and knowledge. I was very lucky from a selfish point of view that it was only our family on the historic tour. He speaks good English and was a good laugh. He spoke about things without bias and when he recommends the \"ice cream\" or \"coffee\" outlets...take heed. Was the best I've had in BA. Ramiro, I wish you all the best....because without your advice I would have missed out on some wonderful times."

I had Ramirez for both the Historic Buenos Aires and the Recoleta tour and tipped him about $10 each time, for which he was most grateful. That's about $3/hour, and he's worth ten times that much! He knows his history, has a balanced worldview, speaks a delightfully Spanish accented English, and is friendly and polite. What's not to like? Nothing."

Would have much preferred to go with these guys as there were 30+ on the other. Adam knew his stuff, spoke English very well and discussed things \" off script\" like Argentine way of life now & their political & economic issues which I like to know about the countries I'm visiting. Adam is off to Australia which I'm sure he'll do very well, but it will be a loss for BA. Best of luck!!"

It goes deeper with anecdotical knowledge of the city that goes beyond dates and architectural styles. It really guides you through the city while painting a living picture of it as a breathing entity filled with heart as data.I recommend Demasiado Tours thoroughly."

He was loud enough for our moderate size group and as we walked from place to place he was always exchanging ideas with us, answering questions, and suggesting the best spots for an authentic Argentina experience. He should charge a high rate for the quality of the tour but we weren't require to pay. If you want some history, some photo ops, and a good time THIS is your tour."

We found the tour great, the sights were interesting, the stories were things we could not know just walking around the city ourselves. As for Adam as a guide, he too was fantastic. Friendly, informative, knowledgeable and engaging. When I go on a walking tour he's exactly what I expect from a guide. We enjoyed the tour so much that 2 days later we went on a second tour with Demasiado Tours in the north end of the city. We weren't originally going to do a tour of the cemetery but in the end i'm really glad we did because Adam had great knowledge of the people and stories of the Recoleta Cemetery. Yes you tip at the end of free walking tours but that is how the guides make their money. It is definitely worth it. They are called \"free\" walking tours because they are set up to appeal to all budgets and there is no guilt for how much you can or cannot afford to give. I think its a fantastic trade. Don't let the thought of tipping scare you away. DO the tour you won't be disappointed!"

It was nice that after 1,5 hours he suggested a break for 20 minutes so that we could get some food and walk into a church for a closer look (and reading the other reviews, he does take the reviews on trip advisor seriously enough to improve his tour). In the end he gave us some great tips and answered al our questions. Of course at the end of the tour he suggested a tip, but that is highly usual for a 'free' walking tour (in every country) so you can pay whatever you think the tour is worth.

Alex, our young guide, spoke fluent English showed us all the sites providing us with more than enough information to make this a fruitfull introduction to the city and not a university course on Buenos Aires history and culture. The 4 hour tour took us through all them majot sites of the centro and some more.

Gonza loves his city and it's wonderful to be around someone so passionate and knowledgeable for four hours. Although it is a free tour I was astonished that a few people didn't give him any tips, the guy worked SO hard and totally deserved a tip. He went way beyond the tour and also took us to a great, local empanada place for lunch. He then sent us loads of info about pizza and ice cream places. Fantastic!"

You could not have asked for anything better.The service from the inception of arriving till the time we departed was exceptional. Everybody was friendly, hospitable, attentive and welcome you like family.The wine was plentiful and the food was delicious.Being there at the polo grounds was a treat as I had never personally been. I enjoyed it immensely and had the opportunity to learn how to play and participate later in the afternoon.If you think POLO is easy to play, guess again. It is more challenging and you need the horse to be your best friend.You need to make this a must on your trip as I will be back the next time I come there.Michael"

So - after making your list for BA - Recoleta, Teatro Colon, Ateneo, Fuerza Bruta, MALBA, historical sites, parques, maybe tango...lots of food, you need to add Argentina Polo Day! This was SO MUCH FUN! I love visiting BA, but wanted to break up our week with a trip to the country. I had to choose between a trip to an estancia or Argentina Polo Day. I chose Argentina Polo Day because of the great reviews and because I felt it would be nice to actually \"do\" something as opposed to walking and sitting and eating. What a great choice! I still get kudos from the fam. I am in my 50's traveling with my husband and 19-year-old son. Together, we've been on horses - maybe 6 times, so we are novices. The experience was delightful. We were driven to a polo club in the country where we learned about polo - who knew? and actually rode horses and actually played polo (albeit in a smaller area!) The wine flowed freely. The food was delicious. The teaching was excellent. Every interaction was upbeat and friendly. So, we learned something new, we got some exercise, we enjoyed meeting new people and we got to share this experience as a family.As you can see, I cannot recommend this highly enough. So, go ahead a sign up! On another note - it was refreshing to work with a company that was friendly and accommodating. (As you will see, or may soon know, the concept of 'customer service' is inconsistently applied in Argentina.) With so much trip planning, I messed up with respect to payment options and Argentina Polo Day figured out a solution and was very kind and everything worked out."

There was 4 of us (plus an Argentinian polo groom on each team). 1 of us couldn't ride at all, 2 could bob about and then we had one experienced rider. In order to cater for us all they helped the non rider and blocked the good rider to enable it to be an even playing field.When I come back to BA I will definitely be returning to Argentina Polo Day!"

But I have to say this was one of the most fun days I've ever had (and I used to jump out of planes for a living). The Argentina Polo Day team are AMAZING, they walk you through everything until you're comfortable, and in no time you're on a horse charging down a field toward your wife waving a big stick at her: awesome! The food was great, the people were genuinely lovely, and whilst I'm still battered and bruised from falling off my horse (my own fault, I wanted to beat my wife, not with the stick, just to score another goal), I'd absolutely do it again tomorrow (if the bruises fade and I can walk by then).

You'll drink plenty of wine, eat delicious food (the best empanadas I've had in Argentina - and that's saying a lot!) watch an amazing game (it's SO spectacular in person) and shock yourself with the fact that you actually CAN play polo. This day is 100% worth it - i recommend it to anyone thinking of more than a couple days in Buenos Aires! It's a perfect way to break up the city time and see the \"provincia,\" get the classic \"campo\" experience, learn about the culture, and get some exercise. Enjoy!!"

Our group of six were definitely skeptical going in to this, but Argentina polo day was the best part of our stay in Buenos Aires.Wine is close at hand during all parts of the trip. The ranch is gorgeous. The food is excellent and plentiful. Pablo and the other instructors are extremely nice and make you feel like a pro even though you have no clue what you're doing.

Open Tortugas, Open Hurlingham and Open Palermo. At the 3 get to watch No.1 polo player in the World Adolfo Cambiaso-La Dolfina..you cannot miss watching him play and his team La Dolfina.

We drove out to the ranch and were greeted with wine and empanadas! After having a snack we headed outside to watch a polo game! We got to throw the ball onto the field to start the game, ring the bell to end it, meet the horses and players, and learn about the rules of polo. After the game, we went inside for an amazing lunch. Lunch consisted of more wine (because wine not?), grilled vegetables and lots of different grilled meats including sausage and steak. After lunch we learned how to play polo! I had never ridden a horse before, but the instructor was great at showing me how to ride and then eventually actually hit the balls! By the end we were playing an actual polo match! In the summertime, you can relax by the pool after polo, but I was there in the winter so we went back inside by the fire and ate some dessert. This really was a perfect day!"

My wife and I, her sister, and our two children, ages 9 and 11 all had an experience we will remember for years to come. Well worth the cost and time. It was an all day event where we all learned the game of Polo by not only watching club members play the game, but also had instruction on the basics. When we arrived they met us with wine, coffee and empanadas, I think I ate 8 empanadas. We then watched a very good game of Polo played by the club members. Most notable was that along with the five of us, there was one other person on the trip that day and the organizers were able to get all of us on horses after an INCREDIBLE lunch and play a game of Polo. I have not been on a horse since I was 10 (I'm 44 now) and my kids had not rode before either. We all had a great time. The staff that runs the place were all friendly and extremely gracious.I've been fortunate to travel to many places with my family and we've done some great adventures. Argentina Polo Day stands as one of the most memorable, best organized events we've ever participated in on a family vacation."

The polo day was the highlight of my stay in Buenos Aires, it was so much funPicked up around 10, we were taken with 4 other guests to a ranch about an hour outside of the city. On arrival, we were told to relax by the lovely fire in the lounge (it was a cold day) and offered empanadas and red wine.Then we were taken to a small polo field to watch a game between some players to get an understanding of the game and a brief introduction to the rules. At breaks in the game we were shown how to hold the mallet, hit the ball and taken to see some of the horses taking part.A delicious lunch followed (either meat or veggie), more red wine and coffee and then it was time to put theory into action as we donned our polo gear and played a game. The guys are in the arena with you to help and you get plenty of practice on the horse before the game starts.We all had a terrific time, getting a great sense of accomplishment when hitting the ball! After the match we stayed on the horses for a trot around the grounds followed by a scrumptious dessert (and more wine).Highly recommended no matter if you've never ridden a horse before. They'll take care of you."

We did the complete day tour. Our pick-up was on time, clean and comfortable; transfer was about an hour. The estancia, which doubles as polo club and small hotel, is absolutely gorgeous. It feels like a completely different world just a skip away from the city. Upon arrival we were greeted with hot meat empanadas fresh off the grill and a healthy glass of Malbec. Pablo, our guide/polo instructor, was fantastic. He was funny and informative and totally knew how to calm me down when my horse got a little \u201cexcited\u201d during our polo match later in the afternoon.The overall program\u2026 We spent the morning sipping Malbec and listening to Pablo explain the tradition of polo in Argentina and the rules of the game, all while watching members of the Corona Polo Club play a friendly game of four chukkers. We also hit a few practice balls (off horse) to get ready for the game in the afternoon. We then had a lovely asado (lunch) with the players, Pablo, the owner and horsehands; all of whom were very warm, welcoming and friendly. After lunch we then had a chance to play ourselves. Tito was my practice partner who patiently continued the ball for me when I would miss it completely or grow a little weary in the wrist. After a bit of practice we all played a short game which really made my husband and I appreciate the skill of the game. (We were terrible.) We then ended the afternoon more glasses of Malbec, a delicious tiramisu and transfer back to Buenos Aires. It really was a lovely day and something you will not really experience anywhere else. A must if you are in Buenos Aires!"

Recommendations- I recommend going with a smaller group if possible. We were there with two other ladies and it was perfect. - I recommend wearing/bringing rain boots to ride with (or boots you do not care about). We went when it was pouring down rain and very muddy). Despite the rain we still had a good time. Areas to improve:- The car that collected us was a 2 door car for 5 people (the driver, +me and my husband, +2 other individuals). It was a very small and could have been very awkward. Luckily we were with 2 other great people, but still very tight for over and hour to the facility and over an hour back.

Where to begin?We truly did not know what to expect when the bus came to pick us up at the hotel in the morning...but our friend who recommended this excursion deemed it a \"MUST\" - and we now absolutely agree! Wow, what a day.Connie, our amazing guide, picked us up in a bus and we took a nice drive to the country. Once we arrived, we were immediately handed a glass of Malbec and a warm empanada fresh off the parrilla (I had two and half of my father's...they were so delicious!). We then walked out to the polo field area on the sprawling green estate that had a little resident dog that was so friendly. Ruben, one of the owners of the estate kindly lent me a sweater because I was a little chilly.We were seated on the bleachers facing the polo field, offered more wine and refreshments, and Connie explained the game of polo to us. The players came out on the field, and we were able to watch a match and knock the ball around ourselves in between each chukker. After the game ended, our group suited up, got on the horses and played a polo game! Not easy! But the horses were sweet, and each team had a pro to assist in moving the game along.By the end, we were exhausted, laughing and HUNGRY.Of course the parrilla was already fired up, and they served us an amazing meal with more wine, amazing Argentinian meat, grilled vegetables, and chocolate cake because it was someone's birthday! At that point, the group felt comfortable and relaxed and it was truly nice to celebrate someone - as a friend, not just a stranger.As we ate outside under a roof, it started to drizzle ever so slightly, and it became such a perfect moment. It was like out of a dream. Ruben and Celia, the owners, collect artifacts that outfit their beautiful and rustic home there. It was very cool to see some Argentinian history as well.At the end, we were sad to leave. Back on the buses we went, back to our lives.I most certainly would love to return, and even do an extended stay.Connie and others took so many photos throughout and they send you a link on Facebook afterwards, which is amazing so you can look back on the incredible day with new friends.I cannot recommend Argentina Polo Day enough.

We were in BA on our honeymoon and friends recommended this place to us -- so happy we went! It was one our honeymoon highlights. They conveniently pick you up where you're staying in the city, you arrive to wine and empanadas, you're on a beautiful countryside property watching a polo match, you learn about polo and the horses, drink more wine, have a delicious asada bbq on a long table overlooking the green landscape, and then you're on the horses, getting comfortable with riding and play a 'kiddie version' of polo with other attendees. If the weather is nice, you can hop in their pool after the match! So much fun. Great instruction. Celia and her family and staff are so warm and welcoming! Full disclosure, I've never been too comfortable on a horse and my husband doesn't have much riding experience, but we had so much fun and everyone was able to take their time on the horses at their own speed -- I really appreciated this. The horses are so well trained and really responsive, and the Polo Day team is riding alongside the group helping everyone out and taking photos of your day. Do this. It will surely be a highlight of your time in BA!"

We stumbled on Polo Day, and boy were we lucky. It is a fantastic day. I am a cattle rancher, and assumed Polo Day would be like riding a pony at the carnival. It is not. They feed you a great meal, they explain the game, gladly answer all questions, watch a game. Then you hop on a horse. Get on the field. They throw out a bunch of balls. Practice for an hour. Then we played a 30 min game. The pros playing with us were great help and a ton of fun. YOU HAVE TO GO TO POLO DAY IF YOU ARE IN BsAs!!"

I went with my husband and 2 daughters - ages 16 and 13. Hands down we all voted this outing our favorite day on vacation. The property is beautiful and the day is spaced quite well: snack, explanation of the game, watch a game, practice in between periods, lunch, and then play yourself. The lunch was fantastic - beef, red wine, grilled veggies - so fresh and just the best! I didn't think we'd all be able to manage playing on horses, but the fact that we all did and loved it speaks for itself. Our guide (Pablo) was wonderful and witty and our group was small - just our family and 2 other couples. Plan for a full day - the drive was about 1 hour from where we stayed in Palermo; we got picked up around 10am and returned at 7:30pm."

Next we watched a polo game, then had lunch (very good!!), and played our own game of polo! Some of the people we were with had no experience on horses, and all went well! At the end of the day, you are welcome to use their pool. They have changing rooms and showers available as well. Also, they have rooms available if you wish to stay over night! I wish I would have known that prior to booking because I would have loved to have stayed! The only thing we didn't really like was that we were picked up at our hotel in a very small vehicle. We were traveling with 2 large American men, so it made for an uncomfortable start and end to our day."

I booked online through the website a day in advance. We were staying at an Air BNB in Palermo Soho and were picked up at a nearby hotel for the 40ish minute ride. This whole process was seamless. There were solo travelers, couples and groups. We arrived to the beautiful grounds and were immediately handed glasses of wine and parrilla before walking over to the field. The whole day was very organized. Our \"leader\" Fabio was extremely knowledgable and kind. After learning the rules of the game, watching a match, eating, drinking more and practicing we got on our horses. The horses were so well kept and easy to ride. I think I had the most fun just trotting around the field. The game was fun and I scored a goal but the mallet got very heavy after a while (I'm a 130 pound female). This was the type of day I didn't want to end and definitely the highlight of our 11 day trip in Buenos Aires."

The horses were standing still trying to avoid facing the heavy rain but still nobody from the farm reacted to bring us in but they startet to Hit the horses with the polo stick while my friend, A beginner, was still sitting on the horse.Then we were heading under some trees to Cover from the Rain. All the beginners had to make their own way - on some spooked horses, because our guide was already under the trees seeking shelter from the heavy rain. We were absolutely not taken good care of and felt not save.

I had a few days in Buenos Aires, but after a couple of days of tours and eating an excessive amount of steak, I was looking for something a bit unique. Polo Day scratched that itch.Not only can you not do something like this in the States, the setting is beautiful, the food is excellent, and it's really just a fun time. A great way to relax, perhaps at the end of a trip.Quick heads up/tips & tricks when booking:- Book by messaging them on WhatsApp, they're very responsive- Don't be freaked out when they ask to meet at a random hotel and you're picked up in an unmarked van, with no explanation in the van of what's going to happen (sidenote to Polo Day: You may want to do an intro/overview when you start driving to explain the day and how long the ride will be)- The ride takes about an hour- You're back in BA ~7pm, which is perfect for cleaning up and going back out (you'll sleep on the ride back)Everyone here was extremely friendly and I'm still in shock that they get people who've never been on a horse before playing low level Polo. Tons of fun. Would definitely do again."

There was no pressure to do anything you weren't happy with however a love of horses does help as you do get the chance to spend a good hour or so riding. The horses are very well trained and we felt safe. our only negative thoughts were that we were picked up in the morning in a very dilapidated minivan and the journey wasn't particularly comfortable as most of the seats appeared to be broken and I don't think there was any suspension whatsoever! The ride back was in a different van and was much better. The information we received indicated we would be back at hotel by 7pm but we didn't arrive back until 8pm so don't make any dinner reservations just in case! The wine was free flowing as was the food and all in all it was a great opportunity to experience something different away from the city."

We got the full gear, the instruction, the horses and the game but can we call this 'playing'? Yes we can because we enjoyed it very mum and discovered that hitting a ball on a horse at full speed takes some skills. Anyhow, good fun! All other details you can find in the other reviews."

My day started off with being the first passenger picked up at my hotel by Pablo Fazzari ( an Argentinian hunk!). He was enthused and energetic which was infectious so I started becoming more and more excited about the Polo excursion. We picked up about 6 more passengers and then headed to the countryside of Pilar, which is about a 45 minutes commute from Buenos Aires. Once we arrived on the property you could tell how manicured and beautiful the ranch is. They treated us so well when we arrived that it almost felt as if we arrived to a family friends house. Pablo took us to the field and started teaching us about Polo. He was charismatic and funny as he went over all the details. He had the whole group laughing. Our wine glass were never empty and they made it a point to make sure we all were comfortable and having the best time. After seeing a few matches, we went on the field to practice hitting the ball. We played a game to see who could hit the ball with the bell, we all had fun. The day was just beginning! We went back to the picnic area to have lunch. WHAT A FEAST!!! More delicious food kept coming and coming. You will not starve in their presence, elite hospitality. After our food digested it was time to play Polo!! The horses are very sweet and very trained. I didn\u2019t feel scared or worried. Everyone there are professionals and are attentive to you at all times. We jumped on our horses and attempted to play Polo. I have such respect for the game now, it is not easy but it was exciting to do. We played for awhile. It is an experience I will never forgot and as a matter of fact, I want to do it again in the city I live (Los Angeles). After a workout with the Polo match we all changed and jumped inside this beautiful pool they have on the property. Like I said, it felt as if I was at a friends house. While we are all swimming, we were pleasantly surprised with some delicious Sangria and a bowl of fresh fruit. Life was tough, HA! After our nice swim we headed back to Buenos Aires. I could go on and on about this experience. This by far is one of the most memorable excursion I have ever experience. Pablo took so many pictures of us to capture our moments. He went above and beyond in making this a wonderful experience for the group. I do not believe anyone else could have done it better than Pablo! The Polo players were great too. We got to meet and interact with all of them. Such delightful people. I was very impressed with the female Polo player, Tete; she is just as good or better than the men! Very encouraging. I am want to thank Celia Alfie, from team Argentina Polo Day, who was so diligent with getting our photos up on the website as fast as she did. Thank you, Pablo and Team Argentina Polo Day, for an incredible experience. A++++++++++++++++++Your very grateful passenger (January 15, 2016)Christina Mendez, Los Angeles, California"

To be fair we were not galloping around, for most of the group the horses were walking and sometimes trotting, but it was enormous fun, especially when we got competitive. And we really got to understand the game so much better. But I should start at the beginning. We were picked up from our apartment at 10:00 by Cony and driven to the polo ground near Pilar. She was great fun and full of information about Buenos Aires, Argentina and polo. At the polo ground we had empanadas and drinks and then went to watch a real game and learn the rules and try playing on foot. Then we had lunch. The food was fantastic. Grilled steak and vegetables, the best we had had. And wine, of course. Then we got kitted out (they gave us chaps, helmets, mallets) and got our horses. There were only three people in the tour and each of us had someone on a horse behind us hitting the ball into position for us to hit. Once we got the hang of it we played the competitive game in half a field. What a buzz! We played with Manuel who had played with Prince Harry - star struck! After the game, hot and sweaty, we had a swim and sangria to cool off. We got home around 7:00 pm. Tips: book direct with Celia - it is cheaper. Cash only. Bring jeans, covered shoes, swimwear and towel."

We indulged in a barbecue lunch which was beautiful, then were selected ponies for our own attempt at polo. Despite having prior horse riding experience, it was quite a challenge but so much fun! We then cooled off by the pool, drank sangria and ate fruit. It was such a wonderful day, worth every penny!"

This applied to my partner and myself so I did some investigating and found this particular estancia highly rated. WOW! It wasn't overstated at all.Everyone involved was incredibly friendly and accommodating. The location is beautiful and everything is done to ensure your enjoyment and safety. The lunch was fabulous, polo match exciting and then you get on a horse and play a match! I have been riding all my life and my partner just a few times. We both equally enjoyed the match, as did the others that came out this day. After your polo match you are taken to an absolutely beautiful pool where you get to cool down and relax. The day couldn't have ended more perfectly. The only requirements are long pants and proper footwear (sandals aren't a good idea). Sunscreen is a must during their summer months as you are out there in the brilliant sunshine and it is impossible not to get warm while trying to score goals for your team."

He did a great job explaining polo in a nutshell and taught us how to hit the ball. The welcoming snacks- empanadas were AMAZING, the best I ever had in Argentina. After a meaty lunch, we started to get on the horse and practiced a little bit. Because of our small group size, we have 1 on 1 coach shadowing us on the practice. (+100 points on this. You learned quicker with someone at your side.) Then we did the competition. It was really fun. Highly recommend it. Celia was responsive throughout the booking and communicating the logistics. There's nothing I'd complain about. Purely incredible."

The hotel pickup was as planned. Our guide, Pablo (aka Poli) for the day was not only engaging, he was a very good horseman/polo player. Our fellow travelers were a fun, energetic, and adventurous group. The facility is absolutely gorgeous, clean, well organized. We were greeted with freshly baked empanadas from an open fire oven. We were educated about the game and its rules. We watched an exhibition match of experienced players. We practiced hitting balls on the ground. Then a beautiful lunch of grilled meats and vegetables was served with fresh salad and good red wine. Next we suited up and chose teams with jerseys and protection provided by the staff. Feeling brave and determined we mounted our horses, we were each given a ball with which to practice. Our horses were very well trained, responding quickly to each command. After practice we played a mini match on a reduced size field. We wore ear to ear smiles all day. I'm still amazed at this organization's ability to take 14 complete beginners, and within a few hours, have them on horseback actually playing the game. I say..don't hesitate, DO THIS!!!!"

We were greeted with delicious empanadas, for me they had chorizo sausage & fresh herbed tomato (gluten free). Which I loved. The drinks, wine, juice, water flowed freely all day. They cooked a BBQ for those who were staying the full day. They are small groups, we had only 7. There's a pool right next to the polo field, change rooms, with showers and toilets are there as well.It was a terrific day we learnt and watched a sport we had no experience or knowledge about.

We watched a polo match, had a delicious lunch with so much food and more wine with a great bunch of people and most had no horse experience. First we got to practice with our feet firmly on the ground and learnt a bit about the sport then it was time to mount up! We got to practice and get to know our ponies then it was time for a game it was so much fun and everyone was having a great time and at no point did I feel unsafe or scared of my horse. Once we finished our game we were straight into the pool, fed more and more drinks. It was a full day we left at 9.30am and got back to the hotel about 8.30pm.

Afterward we had lunch with four different kind of meet and grilled vegetables, more wine of course and then back to polo. We got to ride on horses and play polo! This is third time on the horse but it was just fine. Had so much fun! Afterward we jumped into pool. The owner is very friendly and greets you once you get there. Our tour guide and polo instructor Pablo was an excellent. He is very personable and fun! He is the greatest asset of the Polo Club and needs raise in salary! Kadi (Estonia)"

We were picked up right on time and taken to these beautiful polo fields. Wine and empanadas were handed to us immediately. Learning about the game, watching an actual match and actually playing the game ourselves was such, such fun! Plus, the absolutely delicious asado under the trees on such a beautiful day was FANTASTIC! My sister, 21 year old nephew and I enjoyed the experience with a group from all over the world and it made for great and hilarious conversation. The host, Pablo, was the BEST, being very knowledgeable with an awesome sense of humor!! I can not recommend this experience enough!!!"

After spending a week at La Carona with Ruben, Celia and their team, playing daily with polo pro Jose Lezcano, I was playing four full chukkars! The polo team took great care to match me with the right horses and played to my ability while also elevating my game. I had the chance to meet and play with different members of the polo club and loved sitting down to daily huge lunches of steak and wine with everyone after the games. And perhaps the best part of the experience was waking up everyday on the farm, ready to play. Truly an exceptional experience and I really look forward to a return trip."

All of the staff was so accommodating you didn't want to leave. AND...the food...O...the food!!!! One of the best meals in the country. The empanadas were my favorite of the whole trip and they placed such a beautiful spread for lunch we were definitely spoiled by the end. If you do anything in the Argentinian countryside choose this...it's a once and lifetime experience."

We found Argentina Polo Day and it was the best decision we could have made. We were picked up right on time from our apartment rental in Palermo Hollywood and taken to the countryside. On the drive we made great conversation and upon our arrival were fed delicious empanadas and explained the basics of polo as well as our day's agenda. From there we went to the Polo fields which were incredible to see. Watching members play was thrilling, especially since there were some former professional players among them. We were involved as spectators and learning how to swing on the sidelines. The asada for lunch was one of the best meals we had in all of Argentina. Finally came our turn to get on horses which is when the real fun started. As 3 Americans who have barely ridden horses, that was the main challenge. After a half hour or so, we got the hang of it and played a small game. This was thrilling and exciting (trying not to fall off the horse) at the same time, an incredible experience I wouldn't change at all. After tiring ourselves out we were taken back to the \"clubhouse\" for coffee and desert. Here we were treated like family. Overall it was an incredible experience and the service, instruction and amenities were top class. Highly recommended."

The place is stunning and the agenda well executed. We were welcomed with a warm fire, wine, and snack. The food the whole day was delicious and we were never left wanting. The people there were all wonderful and made us feel at home. Everyone ate together family style at lunch, and as I went alone, I really appreciated the sense of community. I also had no prior polo experience but was completely at ease all day. The instructors were very effective in describing the history of the sport, rules, and tips.

On all trips I like to do something out of my normal comfort zone of sightseeing and being a lover of all sports I chose this as my activity for the trip. The staff is incredibly attentive and helpful. I was taught how to ride a horse while it was galloping. Which I hadn't done before because most of my horse experiences have been on group tours that are very touristy. It is an immersion of polo culture in Argentina which is huge. Since our trip was in September it was cold so the pool part wasn't really feasible but we were so tired from polo we just chatted with some wine by the fireplace and it was great!!! "

From making initial enquiries to the end of the day itself, Juan, Celia and the rest of the team were amazing and created what turned out to be a highlight of my entire trip. You get picked up from your hotel and driven about 1 hour outside of BA to their stunning polo ranch, and are immediately greeted with wine and empanadas. After learning a bit about the game, we were able to watch a match of 4 chukkas with some ex-pro players. Juan makes sure to keep you involved at every stage, by ringing the bell, or throwing in the ball. In between in chukka you practise with the mallet and get to know the horses. Afterwards we had a really good lunch (typical Argentine grill) and some more wine, after which you definitely feel more confident about playing polo yourself! Once matched up with your horse, you first spend some time riding, then practise with a mallet and a ball and a mounted helper (one of the players) who will follow behind you and feed you balls. The horses were all fantastic and incredibly responsive. Then we got to play our own match with some of the players which was great fun. Afterwards, I was allowed to continue to ride for a while, before we headed back to the city. The team were all so friendly and welcoming throughout the entire day and it was evident how much they all enjoy running the operation. The only thing I would say is that although they say that you don't need any riding experience, unless you are really confident I would suggest that you wouldn't get as much out of the day compared to someone who was a more experienced rider. A lack of polo experience really is not an issue however. All in all it was a fantastic day out of BA and I would urge anyone remotely interested to sign up!"

I could not have asked for more from Ruben, Celia, Pauli and all the grooms who looked after us so perfectly and made us feel completely at home on the idyllic farm. Highlights include DELICIOUS food and wine from the outset, best meal I've had in Argentina hands down! Great to watch a polo game how it should be done and then plenty of time for us to have a go ourselves and play our own chukkas. The teachers were so helpful and we basically had a helper each- so ideal! What a day, desperate to come straight back!"

When we got there we were welcomed with wine and empanadas, while a professional polo player demonstrated the equipment and gear for the horse and the player. We watched a game played by professional player, talk to the players and took pictures with them and the horses during the intermissions. After the game we enjoyed an amazing asado while tasting excellent red wines. After lunch we got a polo lesson, did stick and ball and were able to get on the horses and play a game. I\u2019ll recommend Argentina Polo Day to anyone interested in having the real Argentinean Polo Experience\u2026 looking forward to go back next time we visit Argentina."

I visited Argentina Polo Day a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it so I decided to come back again on my recent stay.Celia tried to make everything possible from the start and replied really fast which made booking and everything really easy. On the farm all of the staff was very welcoming and the food was great! What I enjoyed most was first watching the polo match and then to actually try it myself. Since I am riding at home too, it was so much fun.. and I am thinking about an extended stay on the farm to learn more. Ruben and all the others have been great hosts and it was worth every penny to go there again."

I wasn't 100% sure what to expect but I was really keen to learn a little about Polo so booked this day trip with Argentina Polo Day. From my very first contact with them, Celia was amazing, super helpful and really quick to respond. As I am a solo traveller I needed to tag along with another group and Celia made sure I was kept informed as to when there were other bookings I could join. You are picked up from your accommodation (at a very sensible time, after 10am) and driven to the Polo Club about 50 minutes from central BA. The surroundings and scenery at the Club are beautiful. Our guide, Juan, along with the staff at the Club were all very welcoming, friendly and extremely informative. The wine started flowing as soon as we got out of the car, which is always a welcome sight to me, and didn't stop flowing all day! Fresh, tasty empanadas off the BBQ along with the history and rules of Polo delivered by Juan was first on the agenda and then a Polo game followed by an amazing lunch. After lunch we got to have a go ourselves, which was great fun. I have never been on a horse but was carefully instructed and guided by the staff and loved it!Although it was a beautiful, sunny day it was still winter, so it wasn't warm enough to take advantage of the swimming pool but it would be very inviting on a hot day!The pace of the day is just right, very relaxed but you seem to pack a lot in. I highly recommend this, it's a great day out."

We booked in pretty late but they were very accommodating and it was a fun day overall. We were picked up from our hostel, and shown an introductory video in the minivan. The first part of the day involved learning a bit about polo and watching a game between the club members. They got us involved right from the beginning by letting us do the throw-ins and having us undertake in activities during the chukkers. After their game, we learnt how to ride horses and then play our own game of polo. We were well supervised at all times so safety was never a concern. The lunch that was provided was great with plenty of vegetarian options. They also made sure that our wine glasses were always topped up, with helped give me some courage to get on the horses. The only downside for me, which was beyond Argentina Polo Day's control, was that it was off-season and it had been raining the previous day so the game that we watched was just a friendly game between the club members on the smaller field."

We had kept the memory of our first visit in our minds but this visit was even better: The horses were sweet and for me, a nervous rider, easy to ride. Ruben BBQ was heroic and the Empanadas so tasty! We believe we know a bit more about polo after our first PoloDay, so we felt smug in \"helping\" first-timers. The Swimming pool was lovely after all that \"hard polo work\"!Everybody was just as helpful and friendly as we remembered and we have made plans to go again next year!"

Our pickup arrived early to our hotel and drove us to the \"country club\" about an hour away. The facility itself is very basic (not like any country club I've visited), but everything else about this place is wonderful. We started with wine and snacks and were entertained by our instructor. We proceeded to the big polo field to watch an exhibition match by actual polo players who were quite skilled. After the match, we returned to the club area and had an incredible feast of grilled meats, salad and more wine. We were then instructed in the basics of polo and riding techniques. Amazingly, we were then entrusted to pick out our horses and play our own match (albeit at a very close pace). This is an experience you would never get in the States where liability concerns would be HUGE given the combination of alcohol and horse riding by unskilled amateurs swinging wooden mallets. In Argentina, however, all of these things combined for an incredibly fun day. At its conclusion, our ride dropped us off at the airport to fly to Mendoza, our next stop on the trip. Couldn't have been easier or better."

My girlfriend and I visited BA last week and were looking for some things to do outside of the normal sights, and I must say this place delivered fantastically. It was hands down, the best day in Buenos Aires. We actually called at the last minute and the owner of the ranch was incredibly helpful in securing us a ride from our hotel in Recoletta to the ranch about 45 minutes outside of the city the same day we called (included in price). Once we arrived, we were greeted like long lost friends. The two owners (a husband and wife) and their workers were nothing short of spectacular and genuine hosts the whole day. They fed us with steak and wine like my grandmother would, not taking no for an answer. (In America, I rarely eat red meat, but decided for the trip to indulge. This was by far the best steak I had on the trip.) The day was very well planned with a get to know you in the morning, followed by a polo match to watch, a family like sit-down lunch, a few polo lessons in the afternoon, and then a fun little match to close out the day. The people with us that day were also so friendly, so I feel like that added to the relaxed atmosphere. What with their daughter running around and their 10 new puppies chasing her, the atmosphere of the place was idyllic. Kind of like you were long lost friends from another country.My tip to anyone thinking of going would be:Yes, it's an expensive day, but everything is taken care for. If you can pay in dollars ahead of time, it's a better deal. Don't expect a professional match with spectators and what not. I believe the people playing polo are professionals, but they meet up like you would meet up for golf at this polo club. It's not like a league. But unless you are a serious follower of polo, it doesn't matter - the competition was good.Also, the polo playing is a bit more difficult than you would expect. But if you can physically handle it, try it. It's tons of fun. If you can't, just watch!... or just parade around on the horses without trying to hit a little ball with a mallet.I would highly recommend this to anyone just looking to enjoy a relaxed day of doing something different with a bunch of people at the ranch who take pride in what they do and who genuinely just want to have a good time with you. Thanks so much Ruben Celia and team for the best day in Buenos Aires!!"

It didn't take long for the wine to follow. Great morning watching the polo match and learning polo basics. Lunch was very good. Not much to eat if you're a vegetarian, but steak is my favorite animal so I was in heaven. :-) Meat was tender, albeit a little fatty around the edges, but there was plenty to go around. Dessert seemed like it was canned fruit, but it was refreshing after all the meat and wine. We mounted up after lunch and actually played a polo game. Riding time was about 1.5-2 hours. The horses are fairly tame for the most part and can tell when they have an experienced or inexperienced rider. I felt very safe riding around, but this wasn't my first time riding. A few members of the group rode during the practice time but didn't participate in the game. Everyone had a great time, and I'm sure it was hilarious watching us try to play. Thanks to Rueban, Poly, and Celia for a great day! This is a great tour. It's definitely more expensive than a day trip to an estancia, but you get LOTS of wine and food and much more riding time here."

We were both a little bit nervous about learning how to play polo, given we each had minimal riding experience but as soon as we arrived, I knew the day would be stress-free and totally fun. We immediately felt welcome and at home as we arrived at the polo club. Not only were we welcomed by wine and amazing empanadas but each of the polo players present at the club were warm and friendly. The day was a perfect mix between leisure time, watching polo, and riding. Learning to play polo was more fun than I could have ever anticipated! The instructors made sure that each of the members of the group were comfortable on the horse and spent ample individual time helping us to hone our polo skills before beginning our match. The match was hands down one of the highlights of my trip! You truly do get to try out your polo skills in an environment that is totally judgment-free and ends up being hilarious (at least in our case). I highly highly recommend booking an experience with Argentina Polo Day if you can fit it into your trip!"

For a rider like me with 2 years experience only in arena and trekking before, polo gives you more challenge with both you and your horse. For those who adore horse but without any experience, it's also a perfect opportunity to get to know them and having fun on your first ride. Start from the very beginning Celia was being very friendly and professional, reply my question rapidly.

It was with high hope and much enthusiasm that I scheduled one day of my vacation to sit on the back of a well trained and athletic horse to experience POLO as it is meant to be experienced. All aspects of the day long trip were provided by the company, no corners cut, just an extension of their gracious Argentinean hand to welcome and provide hospitality in their country. Transportation provided, beautiful countryside, open polo fields, Outdoor Asado with wine and other beverages included, opportunity to watch polo and then play. The day passed quickly, and now the memories remain!"

We didn't know how much we would really get to experience a polo game, since anyone can participate in this tour regardless of riding experience. We were pleasantly surprised. We were given an introduction to the game, the rules, the equipment, the horses then we got to watch a real game (because this is a polo club). During the breaks between the chuckers we got to practice hitting the ball from the ground. Most of the people in our group hadn't ridden more than 1 or 2 times, but when it was time to ride, everyone had a good time. Even though the game moved slowly, mostly at a walk, it was still fun. And those that had some riding experience could get their horses to trot and canter. It was A BLAST! We wanted to do the whole thing again but the day we scheduled was rained out. Thanks for the great memories Pablo and crew!"

Then you watch as a game is played...Next, settle down to a grilled meal (again, another Argentinean staple)...then you get on horses and play polo. It's by no means good polo, or fast-moving polo...but it's exhilarating none-the-less.If I had to criticize, I'd say the grilled meats at lunch were a bit too fatty...and the pool area (they encourage you to swim afterward) could be better maintained (on our visit nobody got in). But even with those criticisms, it was excellent.OH, and they have several crazy cute/affectionate dogs roaming the premises...which for dog lovers such as myself is also a plus."

Staff are very friendly and professional. Not an inexpensive day, but worth it for us. We would remind those who attend to remember to provide a tip/propina to the staff. It is greatly appreciated, and unfortunately, we saw some groups did not drop anything into the tip jar. The staff on the ranch work hard to give you a nice day. We recommend this day trip.

So, to complete a family trip to Buenos Aires, this topped our bucket list. We were not disappointed.My teenaged daughters both have riding experience, while my wife and I have done little more than trail rides in national parks in Western USA. The day was perfect for all of us. We were picked up at the flat we were renting and taken by bus about an hour north of the city to a private polo club. There, members pay for the ability to compete, in much the same way as folks in the USA might belong to a golf club. Once there, Pablo, our leader explained the game to us and why it is so expensive. For actual polo matches, the number of horses required is enormous. Each 4 person team has a fresh horse for every one of the 7 minute \"chukkas (like innings in baseball).\" There are 4 chukkas in a demonstration game with most regulation matches having 6 chukkas. That's 6 chukkas times 8 horses (4 for each team) for a total of 48 horses!We were greeted with delicious empanadas and wine. We then were provided a history of polo and the basics of the game. Then we all had a chance to watch a demonstration match. Between the 4 chukkas, when they were changing horses, we had a chance to practice hitting the ball with mallets. There was plenty of equipment, so we all had time to get the hang of it. After the match, we all sat down to an amazing barbeque lunch, with as much excellent Argentinian Cabernet as we wished to consume.After lunch we were assigned horses and equipment. The staff helped instruct us further as we began using the mallets to hit balls from horseback. After about 20 minutes of practice, we had an impromptu match. It was well orchestrated with the instructors prodding us along. We all had great fun (although I'm still sore a week afterwards!). The well trained horses did most of the work taking us along for the ride.When our match was over, there was more wine, swimming and an air conditioned bus back to BA. I wouldn't change a thing. The team has been doing this for a while and really know how to make their guests comfortable. They also did a great job keeping us all safe. I'd recommend this experience to anyone. At $175 per person, I feel it was an outstanding value."

People who don't ride horses or are afraid of them need not to worry. The horses are extremely well trained and I don't think you could fall off even if you tried! Great to learn a little about the sport of polo (like golf, the rule book is extremely thick), watch it be played and then try to play it yourself (albeit, at a much slower pace)! Good food & good wine is served. Do the full day...the very best part of the day is when you get to play the game yourself...so much fun! The only minor drawback for us was that our driver & host for the day was texting in the car while he was driving us back to our hotel....not a good thing to do & made all of us in the car feel a bit unsafe."

Very well organized and well run--with enthusiastic instructors and lots of great people to help our group learn the sport and play in a match. This is a small club of 12 members with a wonderful facility only about 45 minutes drive from Buenos Aires--and they pick you up! In fact, my driver was a member of the club and a great instructor himself. They believe polo is for everyone and they prove it. Oh, and the lunch was fantastic--traditional grilled meats and vegetables--and of course, lots of red wine. Yes, you can drink wine and play polo at the same time. Don't miss Argentina Polo Day."

You then get to witness a full game of Polo played by professional riders and in between each quarter enjoy some fun games/interaction. The sport is absolutely impressive to me so was very enjoyable to learn about the game & actually know how intense,hard & physical it is for both the riders and the horses! We then ate a beautiful BBQ lunch with homemade lemonade, more wine & fresh fruit! Vegetarian option is also delicious! After lunch we each got on our own horse all geared up for a practice & then our very own match! The horses are so well trained & although i found it quite difficult to coordinate everything it was the best fun! After the game we enjoyed some sangria and a swim in the pool with time to relax & chat!  This day was so well organised & the staff were exceptional! I can highly recommend this day out for anyone of all ages! I not only learnt a lot, I met some great people & thoroughly enjoyed some time outdoors and would do it all over again! It was certainly a nice change to the city & one of my favourite day tours so far in my travels!"

Easy day out of the city.There was only a small group of 5 of us for the whole day, and we were very well looked after. 30 - 45 minute drive out of city, gorgeous ranch. Greeted with delicious Argentinian wine and food all day (yes, drinking before riding!). Provided with education about the game, had fun learning skills, watching a match, and then playing. Horses were lovey, however I prefer to look at them rather then ride them, however they were pretty slow and safe and I really have an appreciation of the skill and effort of both horse and rider.The hosts took some photographs of the day, unfortunately it appears a majority of them did not make it to the facebook site or email to us like they said they would. Perhaps they can provide everyone with a USB of the photos at the end of the day (cheap costs which goes a long way).Would definitely recommend this day tour to anyone interested in having a true Argentinian BBQ and learning about the game of Polo.Good value for money and smiles all day!"

Personal pick up from our hotel right on time. 45 minute drive to a world away from downtown Buenos Aires.. It was amazing how quickly we could be in the countryside. We started with a glass of wine and an empanadas. Ten of us watched an exhibition game of four \" quarters\" which is half the length of a championship game. In between quarters (checkers) we learned about the mallet,practiced striking the ball and aiming at a target, and practice passing. All on firm ground. The people in the full day program actually rode horses later. We learned a lot and will definitely do the full day if we return to Buenos Aires."

Could have been fun but it was 80-90 degrees so we were just dripping with sweat. Then relaxed with more wine and the pool and were home by 7pm. Plusses: great service, good food, plenty of wine. Downsides: weather dependent, I think they day is worth closer to $125 than $175."

Celia sent sincere apology emails to all customers, and asked if any customers took photos and would like to share with us.

Wine while watching a few chukkas (polo periods) between Chilean families and teachers. Wine with an amazing lunch (I think I fell in love with malbec!). And finally, getting to ride the horses and having a huge game of polo between everyone! Now I've only briefly rode horses twice before this. I've got to say, these horses appeared happy and proud, were well groomed and super responsive to ride! I haven't ridden a supercar before but it felt like I was in a Ferrari. It was great talking to the horse, thanking him for letting me ride him (I'm ~90kg) and working as a team to get to that little ball and getting some good hits in!All up, it was a great day learning a lot about polo, and Pablo had a great sense of humour and was an excellent host. It was a group of about 14 of us and we were all very well looked after! Thank you Argentine Polo Day :)"

The polo experience is right at the limit for being \"worth it for the money\" but, given that I'm a poor student and hate paying $6 for a beer, that's a pretty solid compliment. It's definitely a unique event that is worth being the big splurge of your Buenos Aires trip and the staff doing a fantastic job of teaching and supporting you. The unlimited red wine was a little unnecessary in the heat of the sun (cold lemonade or mango juice would have been more appreciated) but it was so cool to see experts play the game and then get your own shot. They do a great job of progressively bringing you up from hitting the ball to touching a horse to hitting the ball on an ambling horse to the real high-paced game. And the grilled meat and relaxing in the pool afterwards is soooo nice!"

Even without any experience riding a horse, Argentine Polo Day will teach you to play polo.I had an awesome experience with Argentina Polo Day from beginning to end. Beginning months in advance, I contacted Celia from Argentina Polo Day, who was very friendly and helpful with making my reservation. Even though I was traveling by myself, Celia was able to accommodate me. Even when heavy rain washed out the polo grounds, Celia was quick to contact me about rescheduling. And even though I had to fly out of Argentina the same day, Celia made arrangements to have me taken directly to the airport.The Polo Day itself was a ton of fun. It was a beautiful day out in the countryside. The rules and terminology of polo were explained to me as I drank wine. I got to watch a live polo match, while sitting in the shade. Then we were treated to a delicious asado.Finally, once our bellies were full, we put on our gear, mounted our horses, and really did play polo. Of course, our game didn't look exactly the same as the one played by the professionals. Our game looked like it was played in slow-mo. LOL. But it was still a lot of fun.Pablo was a great host. He was very enthusiastic, encouraging, and gracious. And his english was excellent.I highly recommend Argentina Polo Day."

Everything was fantastic from the prompt and easy hotel pickup to the friendliest, most genuine staff I could imagine - it seemed like everyone really loved their jobs. The BBQ was one of the best meals we had the whole time in BA, and they kept coming out with delicious snacks like empanadas and wood fired pizzas, and the lemonade was the most delicious I've ever had in my life - I don't know what they put in it but I'd love the recipe! The instruction on the horses was really great, and they take excellent care of the polo ponies. I was worried about that because it was very hot and I grew up riding horses and know how dangerous that can be, but the grooms made sure to cool the horses off, get them water but not too much or too soon, etc. All the horses we rode (different horses, and at much lower speeds of course than those we saw the polo club play on) were fantastically well-trained and sweet. We played a game and each team had two ringers (polo club members) on our teams that couldn't score but helped move the game forward, making it a lot more fun than if it were just us newbies. Perfect for couples, a group of friends, or even a family with older children. Overall I couldn't be happier with my experience! Next time I'm in Buenos Aires, I'll be going back!"

If you can afford the reasonable fee, then go; it's polo after all! Most of us will never have a chance to actually play, so this is a worthwhile excursion.There were only 2 bad things:1. The van was late by 45 minutes or so. They did extend our day, however, and we definitely got our moneys worth. It was just annoying. I believe they said they were using a new driver, and would likely not use him again. They also apologized for our delay, which was nice.2. They took photos of us with their company camera, so we refrained from taking a bunch of phoos on our own phones/cameras. However, there was a problem and most of our photos were not published on their FaceBook page. It was quite disappointing. I really wish I had a photo of myself on the horse with my gear on. Part of the fun of playing polo is, of course, showing your friends your kick @ss pictures!! I suggest taking your own photos as back up, especially a photo with yourself on the horse. This was an unintentional mishap, but still disappointing :(** TIP: Bring US Dollars, or pay in US Dollars through pay pal. It is cheaper than converting to Argentine pesos and paying in the local currency!Cheers, Nick"

After being picked up at our AirBnB in Buenos Aires, we were driven to a beautiful ranch outside of the city. We were immediately offered incredible empanadas (make sure to try the corn one) and all the wine we wanted. After settling in, we spent about two hours watching an exhibition polo match, learning the rules of the game, and practicing our skills (on the ground). Next was lunch--a feast of steak, ribs, grilled vegetables, and a fruit dessert that left everyone thoroughly happy. After lunch we were outfitted in our polo gear and spent the next two hours or so learning how to ride the horses and trotting around the polo field. Amazing. To conclude the day, we all took a dip in the pool (and were offered pizza and more drinks).Not only was the setting truly incredible, but the service was fantastic. Throughout the entire day, the staff took extra care to make sure that everyone had enough to eat and drink. It was also really interesting learning about polo and the horses. I'd recommend this to anyone visiting BA...you won't regret it."

We mingled for a while and then were treated to a \"lesson\" on the rules of polo and the equipment, along with a Q&A of anything we wanted to know about the game. Then off to the polo field to watch a four chukker game, played my members of the club. This was followed by an asado and then we received our equipment for our turn on the ponies! We attempted to play a game but mostly just had fun! All the activities on our program were conducted in English (as we all had that language in common). After a full day, we were returned to our hotels. It was a beautiful, interesting, relaxing, and fun day. If you have the time (I spent a full week in Buenos Aires) I say don't miss this one!"

After you watch the game, you head back and enjoy a really good, traditional Argentine lunch. Frankly, I could have just eaten more of the empenadas instead. After lunch you head back over and learn how to play polo. It is so much fun.

I had to move down to four because although it was a truly fantastic experience, the ride there and back to the city were really uncomfortable. It is more like 1.5 hours (not 45 min) from Buenos Aires, which is fine, except there were four of us crammed in the small south american cars. I was literally unable to sit back in my seat because of the space issue in the back seat. The entire rest of the experience was a luxury, delicious empanadas and wine, an incredible lesson on a horse, and great BBQ -- but being so uncomfortable at the end of such an awesome day made me take it down to four stars.

It was nice to get out into the country and every aspect of the day was above expectations. The staff are wonderfully hospitable. They make you feel like they are welcoming you into their home, not a \"tour\". Their passion and enthusiasm for one of Argentina's favorite sports is genuine and infectious. The day starts with welcome wine and introductions, and a tour of the house. It is followed by an overview of the game of polo, the rules, riders and horses. We were then taken to the polo field to watch a live match. Amazing! Fast paced, exhilarating and exciting to watch, it was a great display of the power and skill of the horses and riders alike. In between chukkas, we were taught and practiced on foot the basic skills required to use the mallets and hit balls around the field. Lessons and the match were followed by a fantastic Argentinian barbecue. Great wine and so much great food! Again, this felt like lunch with friends rather than part of a day trip. After lunch, we were introduced to the grooms and taught how to ride a polo pony. Most of our group did not know how to ride but that was no obstacle. The staff's instructions were so simple and easy to apply that within minutes everyone was riding their horse around the field, chasing and hitting the ball. A few more minutes later and the competitive spirit began to show through and a 'real' (albeit slow-motion!) match was in progress. Booking this day was easy and efficient. Cecilia was very responsive and helpful. We arranged to be picked up from the hotel and the driver was courteous and on time. Throughout the day, the staff took photos so that we did not have to worry about multi-tasking photography with polo skills. The digital photos were shared with us at no extra cost. Note that there is a no-obligation request to leave a tip for the grooms, so bring some cash. They work hard to make the day successful so deserve it but we had not known this request would be made so we came unprepared. In summary, my husband does not ride and was not thrilled with the idea of a day with horses. He was reluctant to even join me and yet only a short while into the day, he was captivated, asking questions and enjoying himself. So much so, that he described this day as the best part of our trip to Buenos Aires. I couldn't agree with him more!"

I expected to learn about polo and maybe see some gameplay. The program is well run; there is introduction to the rules, then you head to the field to watch a match. Between sides, you get to visit with the horses and you spend some time playing training games to get a feel for the equipment. There was never a moment that felt awkward, unprepared, or unprofessional.3. The family also owns a winery in Mendoza. Part of your afternoon is spent drinking great wine while you watch. Sipping vino tinto in the sun and watching polo felt very posh.4. The food is amazing. When we got there, delicious empanadas were ready and waiting.

The whole day was really good organised, hostel pick up was on time, food was incredible!!! & really nice people and we'll trained horses. Would definitely do it again and recommend it to everyone! (:For families: in our group was a family with 2 small children and all the people in the club cared so much for them - so even with small kids I can recommend it!"

Luscious green grounds stretched the property, and the accommodating and friendly hosts set up quaint drink stations we could help ourselves to. Huan and Paulo were so friendly and always made sure we were okay and were enjoying ourselves.We watched a polo match played by professionals then were taught how to play the game and ride the beautiful horses. The food was amazing too - empanadas, succulent meats and vegetarian options...I could go on. It was so delicious I couldn't stop eating!I can't stress on how amazing this experience was. We all enjoyed it. A must do in Buenos Aires!!"

There was never a dull moment all day and we were completely taken care of from the start with flowing food and drinks and photographs being taken for us so we could just enjoy the moment, which I feel everyone in our group did thoroughly.

Arriving at the polo villa, you are welcomed with a smiling Ruben, who was there all day to talk to the guests. You receive empanadas- freshly baked and wine upon arrival. Learn a bit about polo and the horses, before learning to play with the mallet, and watching a polo match. Beware it is it sunny and hot out, there is little shade while watching the match. It can get very, very hot. Water is provided though. Pablo ensured all were involved in the activities, rolling the ball for the match, feeding the horses, ringing the bell at the end of the chukker etc. Lunch is served at a large piicnic table under trees, the table was beautifully set, and the food just kept arriving, grilled meat, salads, vegetables, rice and dessert. Of course wine, beer, juice and water also provided. After a late lunch, you get your equipment on and go out to the field to get on a horse and play a game. We have never been on horses before, it was a little frightening at first, but the groomers helped us out a lot throughout. What an experience! It gives a whole new appreciation for the horses and the game and skill required. After the match, back to the villa for cold drinks, and photos.The whole day was very well organized, and there was a nice balance of activities. Amazing experience!! Where else can you play a game of polo while learning and embracing the beautiful countryside and the hospitality of everyone at the polo villa!"

We felt like coming into a loving family, spoiled with beautiful surroundings, fantastic food and a casual atmosphere.

I can't add much to what has already been said - this is an excellent experience which we will not soon forget.The one thing that was different about our visit was that we went with a small baby - 7 months old. We were a bit wary of doing the trip and were afraid we would not be able to participate fully. All the staff were incredibly reassuring and made us and our little guy comfortable. They made him a little crib with couches and made sure he was always well-protected from the sun and the flying polo balls. They watched/held him for us so we could enjoy the excellent asado. When it was time for us to go play, they looked after him and kept him happy and safe for the whole game! I think we must have been out there on the field for at least an hour (probably more though) and our baby was happy the whole time.Obviously this trip is fantastic for solo travelers or groups, but I would add that it definitely can be done with kids or babies. It is an amazing experience and should not be missed!I will add my voice to the chorus saying that the host Pablo is top-notch - truly a world-class guy working for a world-class organization."

It was a long drive due to traffic, but the car was comfortable and it gave the guests a good opportunity to get to know one another. We arrived at the comfortably furnished estancia and immediately were served orange juice and an empanada that was really good. We then learned about polo as we were offered more wine and snacks. The grounds were a nice change from the city. Wide open spaces, farm animals, trees and fresh air. Then we went to the polo concha to watch some of the clubs members play a match. I've never played polo nor watched it so I didn't know anything. They explained the rules and some of the finer points as we watched, which helped me understand the game. Then we went back to the estancia and had some really good barbecue. We ate with the members who had been playing, and they were eating the same food. It was good food. By far the best part was after lunch, when we mounted up on horses and got to actually play polo. What fun. And really surprising given that I had no prior experience. Where else am I going to play polo? For me it's not an easy thing to do. But I had so much fun whacking the ball around on the horse that now I might go to great lengths to find another opportunity. Tons of fun. Do it!"

Argentina Polo Day provides a total immersion experience into this incredible sport and cultural mainstay.From the moment Pablo picks you up at your hotel or apartment, you just know that you are going to have a day to remember for a long long time. All of the reviews you read are not lying, this will be one of, if not the highlight of your time in Buenos Aires.The day consists of to-die-for empanadas, informative instruction on the rules of Polo, up close and personal observation of a Polo match, a delicious lunch, and yes, your very own match...played by you and your group! I know! Are you saying to yourself 'but I have never ridden a horse, how can I even begin to play Polo?'. No joke, put your trust in Pablo, you will ride that horse, and you will hit that ball from that horse!

Because everyday should be better than the previous days: if you like adventure and you are looking for one of those unforgettable days in life, go to Argentina Polo Day!!! It is a super complete day that starts in a farm with perfect green grass, amazing home made empanadas and good Argentinian wine!!! You are lectured with the polo rules, have the opportunity to watch professional polo players while still enjoying your good wine and after an Amazing Argentinian \"parrillada\" you are ready to rock: it is your time to play polo!!!! You need no experience with horses, they are prepared to take you through a super fun experience!!!! I just loved - the horses are very well trained, the instructor is amazing on motivating you to do your best, the farm is spectacular like an antique well cared country side farm: it is a very very complete day!!!! I not only super recommend, but I am alsoLooking forward to go back to argentina to take my 3-5 day polo course!!!!"

This is a very nice way to get introduced to the world of Polo in Argentina. Even if you are not into horses, the day is worth while going! We saw a polomatch, had a nice bbq and rode horses ourselves. Even did play a match ourselves... WONDERFUL ! Even is you don't like horse, the ranch is beautiful and a good way to relax ! DO IT!"

Spent an amazing sunny day at La Carona and it was one of the best experiences of my adventures. We were greeted with so much warmth and wine from our local guide Pablo The morning started with a glass of red wine and fresh empanadas from the outdoor oven. I am a bug foodie so I was excited to see all the BBQ and wood fire oven starting up. We were given a small intro about Argentinian Polo, had a tour of the horses and players before going to sit down in the amazing sun drinking our wine and learning the basics of a polo match. After watching the pros on the field we got back for lunch which was situated outside in the open air. It was amazing and I had wished that one day I would be able to have this style of lunch, outside in the fields with amazing food. Ok I think I've written enough. A must when you come to Argentina."

While we were watching the pros play it rained but they kept playing! We stood under large pine trees and did not get wet (they are HUGE). I asked why they didn't stop and the reply was \"It is our passion\". The rain eventually stopped, the pros changed and we had an amazing lunch with them. THEN it was our turn. After the lesson, we got on the horse and when we got on the field it began to rain....AND I didn't even notice! The exhilaration of hitting the ball and being on the horse made me forget the rain. It was only then that I understood why the Pros never stopped. The horses are geniuses! Do not underestimate them. If you have never ridden (or are have little or NO experience) you will be paired with a horse to suite your needs. Our instructor was excellent, the horses superb and our experience one of a kind; it was worth every penny! Overall a beautiful day in the countryside of Argentina, learning from amazing animals with an excellent staff. Cannot wait to book a longer clinic; I think my husband is hooked!"

It is certainly not cheap but polo never is and this was a great experience and one which I hope to repeat again with Celine, Ruben and their team. Great family vibe, genuinely fantastic family and staff, who take care of your every need.

The entire staff was great and knowledgable. The meal is amazing and they are never shy to refill your glass of wine. Jumping on a horse after nearly 15 years of not being on one is a little intimidating however after a few minutes you realize the horses are so well trained there is nothing to really fear. The next day my friend and I wanted to go again and if I go back to Buenos Aires, I will definitely go back for another Polo Day. This is a must do if you are in Buenos Aires."

This was largely down to the atmosphere created by the hosts - you are made to feel so welcome and relaxed. The day starts with an explanation of the rules of polo, then an exhibition match. After that a beautifully executed Asado, with plenty of red wine for those who like a glass (or two). Then came our turn to ride. We got a full 1 hour 45 mins of riding - first practising stick and ball, then played our own match. I do ride at home normally, but there were plenty of others there who had not ridden before or not ridden for a long time and they were able to experience the benefit of the whole day too.At the end of the day, all of the participants agreed we should go out for dinner in Buenos Aires and Celia even organised this for us.

Watching the polo game was fascinating and trying to play myself was also fun, Even though i am still convinced I'm the worlds worst polo player. As almost everything else in argentina, you will pay less if you have dollars. At least at the current rate.

            "review": "Amazing - Highly Recommended!. My brothers planned our recent trip to Buenos Aires, and I was shocked to find out that they had planned a day for us to play polo. We hadn't ridden horses since summer camp when we were little, so I was prepared for a ridiculous (albeit hilarious) experience, watching my brothers try to play a sport we knew nothing about - while riding a horse! What I didn't realize is that we would have an INCREDIBLE guide to lead us through the day, teach us about the sport, show us how the pros play, and then several of the Polo Day staff members would give us one-on-one training - and then we would all get to play together! Oh, and all while sipping on wine and munching on the best empanadas I've ever had. It was amazing. Pablo greeted us at our hotel, and was an incredible guide from that moment through the end of the afternoon. Knowledgeable, funny, enthusiastic, and understanding, Pablo truly made this a wonderful memory we won't soon forget. I can't say enough about this sport, the wonderful club members we ate lunch with, the delicious empanadas, the relaxing atmosphere, and of course - our amazing guide! My brothers were beyond happy with the experience, and we all left smiling from ear to ear. My only regret? Not stretching before! Seriously, riding horses is tough! But it was well worth the pain, and I would go out of my way to recommend this to anyone planning a trip to Buenos Aires. If there's one thing you do while you're in Buenos Aires, make it playing polo with Pablo at Argentina Polo Day. In a word, it was perfect! If nothing else, you'll eat the best empanadas of your life - which is why we're all going to Argentina in the first place, right? :) 5 stars! Thank you Argentina Polo Day for the experience of a lifetime!"

It started out with us being picked up at our hotel, then we were driven about 30 minutes or so out side of the city where we came upon the ranch. I personally had never ridden a horse before but wasn't too nervous to being with. Also the delicious never ending wine helped me to get on the horse. I will say that I spent an entire month in Argentina trying to find the best empanadas and these were it. First we learned a little bit about how the sport is played, then we watched a polo match of 4 v 4. They let us throw the ball into play and ring the bell to signify the end of each round. After we watched the polo game we had the most delicious lunch,Salad, asado, grilled vegetables, chorizo, and all the trimmings. By the end of lunch I wasn't sure how I would be able to ride the horse because I was so full, but I did anyway and it was a great time. I wasn't very good at making contact with the ball but I still managed to score a goal somehow. After the game we drank more wine while we relaxed and talked about our day. Overall my experience was top notch. I would definitely recommend this to a friend."

Wow what a fabulous trip to the Argentina polo day I was so glad I did this as I was a little nervous before hand going on my own but no need to be single travellers as Pablo and the team made me feel so welcome set in a beautiful location about an hour from BA I cannot recommend this day highly enough ..on arrival at the ranch the glass of Malbec was very welcome ..and then well it was just such an interesting day learning about the tack rules history and ponies of polo ..throughout the day you just feel so involved ..off to the field to watch a few chukka and some photos with the players then it's lunch everyone sits down together for lunch and it was delicious lovely fresh plenty to eat and more of that lovely Malbec! Next up best bit of the day playing polo it was a blast! I loved it the horses are so well schooled it feels very safe and there is lots of professional help! but when it was match time couldn't help but get competitive! There is such a genuine welcome and enthusiasm from ruben Pablo and celia and all the team that you can't fail to have a great day ..I'm now back in Scotland with my polo mallet dulce de leche and great memories ..I've been travelling all over the world for 18 years and this is by far one of the best things I've done can't wait to go back ..go go go you won't regret it!

Don't believe the hype, you may feel happy with the experience after copious amounts of wine however I do not drink so can give a rather sober review. The food was not of the quality I had expected, if I had know the quality food/drink I would have eaten before or brought my own. Provided with Concentrated orange/lemon juice when I had requested and been assured by Celia via numerous emails I would have fresh fruit juices as I do not drink wine and not a fan of gaseous drinks.Would definitely recommend the Horse riding experience that Miriam and Adrian offer and which rightfully claims the No1 spot at this point, as there passion for horses resonates through the trip, whereas this is trip is more of a money making trip In my personal experience. Would have been safer to have wine offered after the polo game, sooner or later some one will get hurt, as some people had drunk 1 to 1 and a half bottles of wine before getting on a horse. We saw a game before and witnessed an expert take a rather nasty fall, so the obvious risks are there.If I had known what the experience would have been like I would have saved my money and done some more horse riding lessons instead.Over priced for what was offered IMHO."

I should also mention that we were greeted by two adorable and friendly little dogs. Set the tone for the day. Pablo, our charismatic host, made sure our cups were always full and we had everything we needed all day. After an explanation of the rules, we watched a pro game and drank a few more bottles of wine. Then we had what I can only describe as a \"meat feast\". Every cut of cow and pig you can think of. And more Malbec. Then it was time to play. For real. While most of us just tried to stay on our horses, we were able to play a proper game with the pros assisting. A few people even scored goals. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard (from drunken terror). Good times.We did a lot of fun activities throughout our 2 week stay in Argentina. This was by far our favorite day. Thanks Pablo!"

I booked very last minute, and off the bat, was impressed by how warm and professional Celia was - extremely prompt and helpful without being pushy in the slightest. Sent an email at midnight, and she came back less than an hour later. What makes APD stand out is that you're made to feel like family as soon as you arrive on the ranch. Despite having zero experience with horses or polo, I felt safe and looked after the whole day - nothing but sincere hospitality, amazing food, a lot of laughs, and an unexpectedly gratifying amount of riding and playing time. Poly is hilarious and somehow manages to teach you all the rules and technique of the game while keeping you entertained, well fed, and your wine glasses topped - an impressive combination of host, instructor, personal cheerleader, and all-around fun guy. The team's attention to detail and thoughtfulness is evident in everything from the overall layout of the day to the small touches like having bug spray prepared and mate to pass around after the ride. There's a genuine passion for polo that is infectious, and after a day with them, I came away with a real interest to play more.A special mention to the genius behind the empanadas since I had to physically restrain myself from grabbing a third.. or was it a fourth? :) Can't recommend highly enough.

The team at Argentina Polo Day couldn't have been more well-organized, professional, friendly or informative if they tried. We were picked up by Paolo in BA in the morning and watched an instructional/informative video about polo, its history and its rules along the way out to the polo field. Once at the polo field Paolo talked to us a bit further about the rules and equipment, poured us a glass of wine, served us an amazing empanada and then we headed across the field to watch the pros play. We were involved in the game by ringing the bell and throwing the ball into the field for the players all the while Paolo was teaching us further about the game (which was very high speed and excellent). After the game we enjoyed an asado lunch with the players which was delicious and relaxing. Then we put on our gear and headed out into the field to try our hand at the game. The horses were very well behaved and there was one pro to help each amateur. They really went out of their way to make sure that we were getting how to hold the polo mallet and to hit the ball (all the while somehow staying on the horse!). When we were comfortable we 'played' a match with a couple of the pros in the game as well. When they dropped us off in BA at around 7pm that night we were thoroughly exhausted and very happy with our day. Thank you sooooooooo much for such an amazing day! When we return to BA we will certainly be back!"

Pablo then gave us a full and very entertaining explanation about the game of Polo, the rules, the care of the horses, the uniforms, the history, and the etiquette of the game. Then we had the opportunity to watch a real Polo match and even see the change over of horses between chukkers. We then enjoyed a delicious Argentine barbeque together with some of the players and staff, including one of the owners. After this wonderful lunch we were then given our Polo uniforms and saddled up on well trained horses to play our Polo match. We had so much fun and have gained a new understanding and admiration of the game of Polo. Thanks to Pablo, Ruben and everyone there that made this day unique, remarkable, and so much fun.

It was quite difficult (and here is the only small negative thing of the day: we all thought it might have been more fun if we just got to play on our own instead of some of the locals - being much better than us - always stealing the ball just when we were close to scoring) but still a great lot of fun, and probably the coolest experience of our Argentina-trip!

I recommend this super fun activity to anyone who is interested in having fun and also learning about polo as a sport and learning to play!!"

That was a wonderful event and we all were having a lot of fun!It was my first time trying to play polo so now I have some impressions and experience what polo is. The horses were very well-trained so even those who had never ridden before were feeling quite safe and relaxed. Food and wine were also very nice. I really did not want to leave that place! ;))I would recommend visiting Argentina Polo Day to all interested in having good time in Buenos-Aires."

Stephan drove us to the camp and back to our hotel; polo is his favorite sport and he geared himself and played along other players. The whole staff, especially Celia and Ruben, were a pleasure to be around. Last but not least, you need to try their delicious empanadas! Totally recommend this to everyone!! JP"

Having always wanted to try playing polo, Argentina Polo Day seemed like a great option based on the reviews online. Suffice to say, they did not disappoint!I was driven to and from my hotel in BA by their friendly staff, and was able to join another group, as I was an individual. The staff was incredibly friends with a great sense of humor, and really took the time to ensure each person in the group had a great experience and learned a lot about the sport. The wine and food were also fantastic!I highly recommend this to anyone seeking to do something outside the box while in Argentina!"

The people were so accommodating and the man who was in charge had excellent English. We sat down with him and got to enjoy some of the best food, while he explained in detail the rules of polo. We were served red wine, and empanadas, no questions were too hard for the instructor. He looked after all of us so well and even though I was a little scared at the beginning to ride the horse, he encouraged us and made sure we were very comfortable. Polo was so much fun, especially after a few red wines. We all agreed that this was our most favourite day yet. I'm so glad I got to be apart of a very different and exciting activity. The horses were looked after well and they seemed to also love playing polo. Wish I could take part again."

Great service - The rain last night made the ground very wet and muddy to play but the polo team was still able to have a wonderful real game for us to watch aside. Amazing food - empanadas, wine and BBQ were all delicious and unlimited. Nice instructor - dedicated and caring. It was much easier to watch than to play, and finally I was glad to hit the ball and practice in a game. Plan ahead to save one day. I had to go to airport directly after the polo day and paid extra for a private car to drop me off to the airport. A final note to finish, it's totally fine to go there alone and enjoy the game with your new friends in the team. Tons of fun."

Watching a polo match is a thrilling experience - the speed and grace of the horses and the skill of the men is outstanding. You realise how skilled they are when you try it for yourself! You get a good amount of time on the horses and depending on how experienced/confident you are the guys will either let you ride around the polo field a bit more freely or stay with you. One of my favourite parts of the day was visiting the lagoon after playing polo and cantering through it with Stephane. A day I will never forget!p.s. see Facebook for their photos!"

It was a fabulous day, one I would recommend to anyone wanting to learn more about an amazingly competitive and graceful sport.

When I came to Argentina, I was hoping for a possibility to see a match - it didn't even occur to me that it would be a possibility to actually play polo myself. This was actually my boyfriend's idea, whose riding experience is non-existent (okay, to be fair he has sat on a mule once...). We looked into several places but Argentina Polo Day made the best first impression. When we sent them an e-mail we immediately got a very enthusiastic mail back from Celia, and she also said that my boyfriend's lack of riding experience wouldn't be a problem (which was something I was quite worried about). Her response made us even more excited and sure that we were coming to the right place. We got picked up in the morning and on the way to the ranch we watched an instruction video. When we arrived we were greeted by the most playful and happy dogs I have ever met (I'm more of a cat person) and we were handed some drinks. After some more instruction, we got to watch a training game and instructor Poly immediately got us involved in it, a.o. practicing with the ball and stick during the breaks. After the match we had a lovely asado lunch in which some of the riders also joined.Then it was finally time to ride! We had some practice time for about 45 minutes to get used to the horses and to practice with the ball and stick. Of course to hit the ball from on top of the horse is not so easy but the horses were very good about it. After that we played a low-speed game and it was absolutely awesome. Everyone got totally into it and I felt the game was relatively fair in the sense that everybody got enough time with the ball (more or less). I even got to hit the ball from a slow canter a few times which I thought was very cool. After that we were exhausted, so we took a jump in the pool before going home.I would definitely recommend this trip. Your stay in Argentina is not complete without it!"

I would recommend to anyone to talk the time to spend with them.There are many positive things to say, you can read the other reviews to see what I mean, but there is one particular point I want to pass on. The people that run the ranch, our host for the day, and the members of the club who play polo- are all truly genuinely happy to have you there. I felt like part of the family for the day, not just a tourist.The food is amazing and the ranch beautiful, so even if you're not a horse person go there for the lunch and day outside the city.As another note, my husband and I are not easily fussed, like all food and are fairly athletic and we had a blast. However a few of the other people in our group had a range of dietary restrictions, were uneasy about playing the game and had particular scheduled to keep - they also had a blast. Everyone was catered to, and the hosts were very genuinely concerned that we had what we need, and we enjoying our day."

I wouldn't change either and if this day was only polo and empanadas then it would have been 5 stars. However, there were some awful elements.We were told it was 45 minutes from pickup to the ranch. It was 2 hours. Two hours!!!! We drove around BA picking up other people and 2 hours later we were there, dripping in sweat as we weren't allowed to open the windows in the car because of dust but the AC only worked for the two people in the front. On the car - THIS WAS REALLY DANGEROUS - we were picked up in a car that fit 6 people, with 6 seat belts. However, 7 people were put in. So one person had no seatbelt and there were three people jammed in a seat for 2 people\u2026 for 2 hours. Uncomfortable and unsafe. Continuing with the car - It shut off, completely, whilst we were driving - TWICE! Yeah! So not only did we not have seats or seat belts but we were in a car that stopped working whilst it was in use. Awesome.The wine was nice, but they ply you with wine before putting you on a horse. This is weird. And dangerous. A bit off.The lunch was disgusting. The \"steak\" was inedible. You couldn't cut it with a knife. They should've just served empanadas again. Every person was taking the meat and throwing it on the ground for the dogs. Inedible.Then there's the toilet. The toilet with no water. The one and only toilet that had poop in it that I had to go pee on top of. Twice. As did everyone else.Not sure if I'd do this again or recommend it. It had great parts but the safety issues paired with toilet issues was a bit too much. If I'm paying that much money I'd like to at least have safe transportation and a clean toilet. Oh - lastly - heading back was again 2 hours. We were told that we'd be back no later than 7pm. We were dropped off at 8:40 pm and missed our dinner reservations."

We had so many other things planned, but when we saw the reviews, we had to give it a try. Despite being cash-only, the day was absolutely incredible. We were picked up by Poly at our hotel, driven to the club, and served wine and empanadas immediately (early and often!). We learned the rules of polo, watched a match, asked questions, drank a TON of wine, and then had a great Argentinian BBQ lunch. After lunch, it was time to gear up and mount up for some polo! We played for over 90 minutes, and although my horse was a pain in the rump, it was a great experience. It truly made you appreciate how talented the REAL players are. We took a dip in the pool and were driven back to our hotel. It was really a unique and unforgettable experience. DO IT!"

We had an Asado, with a colorful Side Salad and an amazing Malbec Wine. I was expecting fun and spending my afternoon nicely, but here I had a blast!!! Met intresting people from everywhere, laughed until I cried, and really learn something I never though was this unique, trendy an cool.

The day was perfect, we were very lucky in terms of weather; although it was warm and sunny there was a nice breeze which helps with this activity. Don\u2019t be put off this if you have never ridden before as there were many people in our group that had not and picked it up very quickly. The horses are great and are use to novice riders. When we arrived we were given wine and empanadas, which were lovely and you are supplied with wine the whole day which is brilliant. The lunch is also great and there was a great selection and plenty of food for our big group. The staff are amazing, so friendly and welcoming and go out their way to accommodate everyone\u2019s needs. The day is also informative as well as a lot of fun. My only regret is not doing the polo day at the beginning of our holiday so I could have done it again! I would recommend this to everyone, great day and brilliant value for money."

My highlight was Pablo our gorgeous guide who knew everything, answered every question and never let our wine glasses become empty (which is very difficult with 5 Australian girls!) The horses on the ranch were beautiful and friendly and they clearly enjoyed the game of polo. The match was very fun to watch and the games in between were great and hilarious with my now tipsy girlfriends. The food throughout the day was the best I had in Argentina. The empandas were the best I have ever had! Pablo can I please have the recipe!? The lunchtime BBQ was so good and more wine and great company made it even better. I loved getting on a horse and riding around trying to play polo. My horse was very smart - it would stop close to the ball to let me hit it! They know when the tourists are hiding them!After a fun game of polo we decided to cool off in the swimming pool with more wine and banter. It was truly one of the best activity days I've ever done during all of my travels and highly recommend it to everyone! Now when I go to the Polo in Australia I will actually know what I'm watching and how hard it is to play!"

The price in pesos is a bit stiff, but things with horses are always in pricey. If you have cash USD it is an excellent deal. Aside from learning a ton about the game from absolutely ground zero, our group of mixed experience was playing a full-on game by the afternoon. I loved that more experienced players joined us, to help pass to us when we were first starting, then to act as defense when we were playing, to show what kinds of things you have to watch out for in a real game. They were really good about making sure everyone was getting a chance to touch the ball or score."

My husband, 21 yr old son and I were only in Buenos Aires for 1 days (in port on a cruise) and we wanted to do something memorable so we contacted Argentina Polo Day. Stefan picked us up at a hotel not far from the port and drove us 45 minutes to the ranch. We were greeted warmly then joined another group who had come out to spend the day. We were given instructions on the rules of polo then took our seats next to the field to watch a match. We got to participate by throwing in the ball and ringing the bell between chuckers (periods). While the riders were switching horses (they do this every 7 or 8 minutes) we were given shorter mallets to practice hitting the ball. This was lots of fun. We also got to talk to the players and ask them questions about their horses. The match was very competitive and exciting. Afterwards, we walked over to a several long tables that were set with platters of food down the middle. We were treated to a royal Argentine BBQ with a large variety of meats and vegetables. Since we had to leave earlier than the rest of the party to get back to our ship, Stefan came and got us suited up in our polo gear so we could start riding. Each of us was given a mount suitable to our skill level and size. For those who had not ridden before they were given instructions and time to practice. If we had ridden, we were given a mallet and sent out on the field to practice hitting balls. I love riding horses and was surprised to find that hitting a ball made it even more fun. My son, who had never ridden, had no trouble maneuvering his horse to steal my balls. Before long we had divided into teams and were playing a match. We would all very sad when the time came for us to dismount and head back to the cruise ship.  Celia was wonderful to work with. Stefan let me ride one of his own polo ponies, La Colorada. He was a delightful instructor. Pablo our guide was charming and very informative. I highly recommend this adventure to anyone headed to the Buenos Aires area. You will not be disappointed!"

When I booked, I expected a relatively impersonal polo match, followed by a quick how-to for polo playing - was I ever wrong!! As soon as we arrived, we were greeted like friends, given a glass of wine and the best empanadas I've ever had. The atmosphere was warm and friendly, Celia and Pablo made us feel like family and introduced us to life in BA. After watching a fantastic polo match from the sidelines and meeting the polo players, we enjoyed a delicious BBQ with them and the staff, followed by an intro to polo playing. They gave us each a horse with a guide (if you needed one) and we spent about an hour riding around the luscious grounds getting comfortable with our horse and a mallet. Since there were only 4 'guests', they split us into 2 teams mixed in with polo players and guides and we played an actual polo match for close to an hour. I can't say enough about what a fantastic day this was...there is absolutely nothing I would change!! The food, the people, the guides, the polo playing...this will forever be one of the highlights of all my travels. If you like the outdoors, being active and seeing authentic polo playing, this is definitely a must-see and worth every penny!!Enjoy and say hi to Celia for me!Sonia Faucher (Canada)"

The drive was about 45 minutes outside of Buenos Aires, up the highway, down a road and then down a dirt road! Where were we headed? There was a house where we left our stuff and met the other participants. The day was run by the English speaking manager. First there was wine/Coke and homemade empanadas. They were delicious and plentiful. He gave us some basic tips about the game of polo. We walked out to the polo field where there were chairs set up for us to watch a game and see the horses. More empanadas, more drinks! Lunch was served back by the house. All grilled-- short ribs, onions, zucchini-- all delicious. After lunch was time for us to mount the horses and try our hand at a game of polo. Fun, fun, fun! It was a warm day back to the house and there was a swimming pool. Everyone had fun. Our driver picked us up and we returned to the city (at about 7pm).If you know some Spanish try talking to the owner, Ruben. He sat under an awning drinking a beer and watching what was going on. I had a nice conversation with him, he is delightful but does not speak English."

I researched and started corresponding with her several weeks before the trip and she was always prompt, courteous and concise. Her follow up was pleasant and never pushy. . . The booking process was very smooth and they delivered on every promise - Very grateful for that since not every booking experience from afar is answered or efficient!About the day. . . they picked us up from our home at precisely the time they said they would. The ride out to La Carona was nice and the countryside was a nice departure from the hustle and bustle of BA. Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by the gorgeous Pablo and offered a glass of wine. We felt instantly relaxed, safe and at home!The colours and d\u00e9cor of the main house and surrounding farm was stunning. In the back of the house, there were tangerine trees brimming with fruit, a barbeque pit with colourful vegetables roasting and a nice long table set up for lunch. On the day we were there, there were 15 others from all over North America and it was great to meet fellow travellers!With a glass of wine in hand, we were seated and the origins and rules of Polo were explained. After this, we walked to the polo field and watched a very exciting polo match (while drinking even more wine!) Everyone really got into the game! Even though I didn't start the day as a fan of horse or polo, believe me when I say I have a huge amount of respect and love for both now!After a superb lunch of barbequed meats and vegetables and conversations with new friends, we actually got on the horses, worked on drills, and later had our own polo match (OK - so we THOUGHT we were having a match) Wow, what a work out but so much FUN! Most of us had not been on horses in decades but yet, we managed to hit the balls with our mallets and stay on the beautiful beasts! It was sad when our day ended. . . Many thanks to Pablo, a most handsome and charming facilitator! Thanks to everyone that took care of us - we know that there were many people in the background making sure every detail was perfect.If you are in BA, you must book Argentina Polo Day - You will have a great time!

I recently participated in an intensive eight day Polo Clinic at the La Carona Polo Club where daily guest participate in an extremely popular Polo Day event. Im an avid horseman and Endurance (long distance, multi-day) competitor residing in Washington State, USA. My long held desire was to travel to Argentina, the epicenter of world class Polo, and have my first experience in the sport be with the worlds best. A friend who attended Polo Day and subsequent clinics provided rave reviews and even insisted on attending with me. I can only say every expectation was exceeded! The accommodations were first class in the new club house, the food and wine were exquisite and ever so plentiful, the service superb and oh the Polo! I was assigned the head groom as my instructor and he was amazing. Manuel was patient as a saint with incredible horse and mallet skills. He paired me with the most sensational, well trained horses I have had the privilege to ride. My favorite, La Pintada, was a completely reliable, safe and beautiful painted Corollia with a silky smooth canter and gallop. She allowed me to ride at speed while concentrating on ball and mallet skills. All the horses were similarly well trained with lots of go. Every day included intense \"one on one\" training followed by interaction with the day guest in a fun, easy going match. They came from all over the world and most transformed from apprehensive doubters to enthusiastic participants as the day evolved. Everyone enjoyed themselves emensly. On the next to last day I noticed the owner, Ruben, observing me as I moved the ball up and down the field during my training session. To my never ending delight and consternation, he invited me to play in the club member match the following day. My stomach was churning as I worried about making a fool of myself or worse at speed with those quality players. Going for broke, I accepted and had one of the most marvelous experiences of my life. Although my ball handling skills were lacking, I was able to keep pace with the group an play some defense and even bump and grind as I went for the ball. ( I believe Polo is the only horse to horse contact sport). I could go on forever about this once in a lifetime experience. I'm sure I learned more in eight days than I would in a year of lessons back home. I plan to be back next year for a more advanced session and will practice, practice, practice in between!"

First you watch a game of Polo to understand the rules. They will gauge your experience on a horse (mine was almost none) and choose a horse accordingly. Once everyone is saddled up they teach you the basics of riding before you start practicing hitting the ball and playing at a walking or trotting pace. Very easy for everyone. For those with more experience who wanted to ride faster a group broke off and also had a great time battling it out. I'm actually quite sporty and had no problem hitting the ball and one of the workers traded his horse for mine and I was in full gallop before you knew it. It was truly one of the highlights of my trip and I'm seriously considering going back and spending a week there for their intensive session."

The trip to Pilar was around 1h15. We were greated with the best empanadas I have ever eaten and some wine to wash them down. After it was time to watch some members play while we are taught some of the basic rules. Before we start our polo game we are served an asado. Finally it is time for two hours on the back of the horse of which one is the actual game. I am not accustomed to horses but I found the horse easy to run and lets face it, chasing a ball and trying to score is always great fun."

While we sipped, Pablo explained the history of the sport in Argentina. Once the players were ready, we headed over to the field to watch the match. We participated in tossing the ball in and got to see all the pollo rules in action. After the match we were treated to an awesome Argentinian BBQ while enjoying great company and conversation. And then, yes, we mounted well trained ponies and got play pollo! Not too worry if you haven't been on a horse. The horses and staff are top shelf and will help you have a fun and safe experience.

Lunch was an AMAZING parrilla which included several types of meat, salad, sides and again more wine. You will not be dissapointed with this lunch. Ever. Afterwards, we were able to pratice the sport with our own horses and teachers.This was our favorite part of the day.

I was picked up at the hotel on time and brought to the farm about 45 minutes outside of Buenos Aires. There was plenty of empanadas and wine when we arrived. I was paired with another couple and a woman from Australia who were a pure joy. We were explained the rules of the game and then were able to watch a polo match in the morning. The members playing were passionate, fun and enticing. There was a healthy competition to the game which made it exciting to watch and made me eager to learn. At lunch we were served an authentic BBQ with plenty of steak, vegetables, wine...and healthy conversation! In the afternoon we practice some strategies and were able to mount the horses. The horses are well cared for and groomed-true polo ponies with zest and vigor for the game. The staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and safe on and off the horses. They even lined me up for a goal or two! It was open of the most exhilarating experiences I have had in a long time. I could not stop smiling and laughing. It was pure joy!

My coworker (Carol), mom and I all went to the Argentina Polo Day, with different expectations and desires for the day, but each of us left thinking that day was the very best of the trip. Carol, is allergic to horses, and even without being about to ride or touch the horses she said that the ability to watch and understand the game plus the gracious hosts made the day completely worth doing. Carol also loved sitting out of the city, getting some fresh air, while sipping on a delicious Malbec :). My mom, is afraid of horses, but she was able to go at a speed that made her comfortable and confident on the horse. They had a man walking directly with her the whole time she was on the horse, giving her tips and helping her feel safe. I love horses, but I'm not much of a rider. I wasn't afraid to try though, and the Polo day gave me a long private riding instruction. By the end of the day I was galloping and actually contributing to the game of Polo I was playing in. Seriously, the best day of my year!Yes the food is good/the wine is tasty, yes the scene is lovely, but more than any of that, the group of people at the field tailor the experience to you and make sure everyone leaves as happy as can be.

There was a fire pit to keep us warm on the chilly winter day and the crew even provided us with jackets and blankets to watch the match. Each of us got a turn tossing the ball into play. The crew then directed us in playing warm up games on the field with the ball and mallet before we mounted the horses. Being a novice horseback rider the crew was so helpful in giving me explicit directions on how to 'drive'. I even managed to hit the ball a few times!!! We then went inside for an authentic Argentinian BBQ - and the food and wine flowed. Chorizo, steak, delish vegetables - I rolled out of there!!!

I am a 47 year old business man traveling thru Buenos Aires from Florida and decided to take a couple days of personal time to enjoy the world of Argentine Polo firsthand. I did my research and decided to book a 2 day Polo clinic this June at the El Camino Polo Club and Ranch in beautiful Pilar, Argentina just outside of Buenos Aires. Here, owner, polo player, coach, chef, and sommelier Ruben and his lovely wife Celia also operate their year-round \"Argentina Polo Day\" operations available to anyone living or visiting Buenos Aires. I really appreciate their love of polo and genuine interest to share this passion with those interested regardless of riding or playing experience. I haven't ridden in 4 years and after just a couple hours was feeling very confident and comfortable enough to accept the invitation to play 4 chukkas on my second day. Yes, Ruben threw me into the \"fire\" :-) and I loved it. I even made my first GOAL at that game and also found the other players to be very courteous and gracious to the \"new guy\". Ruben gives you lots of personal attention and he along with his instructors do a great job of helping develop riding and playing skills. You basically ride as much as you can handle or desire while there is daylight. Totally awesome ! Ruben has 3 polo fields with 2 more in a few weeks, over 60 horses and those I road were wonderful. Accommodations are available right inside the ranch or Celia can arrange for very luxurious accommodations nearby. I slept at the guest house at the ranch just steps from the polo field. The food is Fabulous!! and \"Don David winemaker\" is one of El Camino's sponsors, so his delicious wines are available at every meal. Ruben, Celia, the club members, and staff will make you feel like part of the family and I can honestly say my experience exceeded my expectations in all areas. It is a sincere pleasure to write this review and I look forward to my next visit."

The whole day is run so well, by amazing people. With unlimited red wine and an amazing BBQ for lunch. This was the first time I had experienced Polo and because of this day, I am hoping to carry on playing. You get to see a live Polo game and then you are able to play in your own live game whilst learning tips from experienced players. If you can only pick one thing to do in Argentina, I would recommend this for sure! I would not have a single negative thing to say about this day even if I tried! Such a nice and relaxing day for all people!"

The polo day was fantastic and fabulous! From our arrival in the beautiful Argentine countryside and warm and welcoming greetings from the staff with wine and delicious empanadas to the educational experience of learning about polo and then seeing the Polo Game, prepping and getting a bit of fun exercise and then a wonderful, delicious \"asado\" feast at a beautifully decorated table outdoors under blue skies (with more wine) and ultimately riding the horses and playing polo, it was one of our best days in Argentina! Even those in my group who don't ride loved the Polo Day and took pics on a dedicated picture horse! I do ride and learning polo and then running the horses across the polo field was thrilling. The staff was top-notch, friendly, warm and helpful throughout the day. If you go to BA, you should deifnitely spend a day at Argentina Polo. I had thought about the ranch but they were less responsive so I am positive we made the right choice! The cost is worth the experience!"

I recommend for ALL travelers, frequent or first timers. The ranch is beautiful, Ruben and his staff are so wonderful and make you feel so comfortable, they explain the game very well, you get to watch an awesome game of polo, delicious asado and we got to experience horse-riding and some polo - for all level of experience. Don't be intimidated if you've never heard of polo, or if you are a pro - this is for you too! There is definitely a family feel to it and did not feel touristy. Such a great experience, and we loved it!"

This time I brought my husband and we stayes overnight. It was fantastic: we started with a welcome drink over a romantic blazing fire, then slept in the most comfortable accommodation right there in the Club House. The next morning Ruben gave us a copious breakfast, after which we had a wonderful ride out along the estancia's grounds and beyond. Lunch was a fantastic as I remembered it and then it was time for the polo match. We brought our own Finca los Tigres Polo Team shirts with us and Ruben kitted out half of his men in our colours! Imagine our delight when \"we\"won!! After this uplifting experience my husband and I mounted our polo ponies and had a good time playing stick and ball, with exeprienced instructors who enjoyed teaching us yet that bit more! Sadly, we only had that day and left with many polo plans for the future. ArgentinaPoloDay is a superb way of getting to know polo and we thoroughly advise it!"

There were 12 of us plus another few couples and I cannot tell you how much we loved it! The booking process was super easy; they picked us up and dropped us back at the hotel - Celia is incredibly well organised - and more importantly, the experience is one I will never ever forget. The day stated off with the most delish empanadas we had anywhere on South America, wines and a quick explanation of the rules, Steph, Alex and Alex were such a joy. And the slight language barrier between us and Ruben did not curb his enthusiasm in demonstrating a range of essential skills. Brilliant! Following this, more wine while watching a professional polo match right there on the ranch. The game was fast and furious and of a very high standard, the young kid absolutely killed it! It was truly brilliant. Our lunch cooked on site all in their parrilla was absolutely delish. And as much as you could eat... Brontosaurus ribs we were calling them! And then...it was our turn, to mount the professionally trained polo ponies for some practice followed by a game against each other. Hilarious yto play, i cannot even begin to imagine how funny we were to watch. Luckily the horses knew what they were doing, such amazing animals. And the puppies on the farm...we absolutelu wanted to take Nandomhome with us!! The Argentina Polo Day was undoubtedly one of the absolute highlights of my South American trip, and a at I will never forget. I can only hope that one day I got a chance to return and experience this incredible opportunity again. Wines, delish authentic Argentinian food and Polo...what more could you ask for on a day out in the outskirts of Buenos Aires?! Thank you Celia, Ruben and your team for your wonderful hospitality and for making this a day that when I look back on, I will laugh and smile as one as the best days I've ever had on a holiday."

After a quick explanation of the rules, we headed over to the pitch to watch out first polo match. After a few more glasses and some more empanadas, we enjoyed a few basic lessons in 'horseless polo' in between rounds, and then after the match (thrilling in itself) we got up on the horses and had a go at hitting the ball and riding around, all under the careful supervision of the club members. The beautiful weather helped, but all in all this was a stunning afternoon, and a great break from the city. Highly recommended!"

The drive up was beautiful, the property was amazing, it was green and had the feel of a rustic farm. Ruben was grilling when we arrived and it smelt so good! We first had some of Ruben's empenadas (best we have ever had to this day) and handled the mallets and balls. Second we watched a match which was very impressive. We had lunch and it was great. Ruben is a very nice guy and there was a gal from Germany that was very fun too. The blood sausage was under cooked and two of our group become very ill however we cannot for sure it was the sausage as we ate a lot of other food. After lunch we saddled up and played our own \"match\" it was a lot of fun however we were new to horses and polo so it was probably more fun to watch us than the match we were playing. After the game we took the horses and rode around the property which was nice. The end came and we ended up paying more than we ought to have. I know Ruben could discern our disappointment at his currency exchange so he gave us some mustard and two polo mallets ( chiliean airport police took them from us :( ) We had a great time and i would do it again however i know to bring cash or better yet, Ruben, if you are reading this, invest in a credit card machine!"

I really had to focus in the beginning so I could get the most out of the experience since I was new to riding. But the volunteers were awesome teachers and extremely supportive. I was galloping, trotting along with my mallot in no time (disclaimer: learning curve for everyone is different). It was a great workout, really have respect for these horses that are very disciplined (My hosre Torito was very disciplined, I just was confusing him since I was newbie rider...all in all fun). Overall this actvity is a must experience (if I had to write a book of the top 100 experiences to do in your life, this would be on it). It was both formal and informal at times with just the right amount of structured activity to make the experience fun."

Great Day out, starting with a glass of wine (or two) while the rules of the game were explained and then watching a polo match with some ground practice swinging the mallet in between Chukkas followed by a brilliant asado lunch (no I cannot possibly eat any more!) After lunch the real fun began when we got on the horses and headed for the polo pitch. Would definitely recommend it to both experienced riders and beginners as they catered for both very well. The horses were well cared for, tack in good condition, beautiful setting and all up a great day out trying something new."

The food and unlimited wine throughout the day was incredible! Ruben, Alex, Steff, Merlo (sorry, spelling?!) and all the other guys there were really fun, welcoming and knowledgable!

Ruben and Celia have designed a fun-fill day to introduce beginners to polo - not just watching a match, but also giving us the opportunity to play the sport. Very professionally run and geared to encourage the most novice of players (and riders) with one-on-one coaching from getting comfortable with riding a horse to teaching us the skills required in playing a real match. They also keep you well fed - the welcome empanadas and bbq lunch (asado) were delicious as well as the unlimited wine and refreshments. Definitely one of the highlights of our trip!"

We had a great time and had a chance to do a lot of fun and interesting things (Cemetery Tour, Closed-Door Restaurant, Tango Class, Tango Show, Tigre-Delta Boat Ride, Day-Trip to Uruguay). That said, the Argentina Polo Day was without a doubt the highlight of the entire vacation and an experience we will cherish for a very long time. Our interactions with all involved were incredibly positive. Celia was very helpful with taking our reservation and getting us set-up in advance. The on-site volunteers (Alex, Steph and Potter (sp?)) were so much fun and both helpful and informative in educating us to the sport of Polo and horse-riding. Finally, Reuben (the owner) was the ultimate host, wearing many hats (literally!) as host, cook and Polo player! The entire experience was first-class from the pick-up at our hotel to the drop-off at the airport. The ranch itself is so large there is more than enough room to ride for both the novice rider to the most experienced. The BBQ lunch was incredibly tasty and filling. For those who don't eat beef, the staff was gracious enough to provide alternatives to the menu to accommodate our dietary restrictions. For those who don't speak Spanish, no need to worry as everyone on hand speaks English as well. If you do only one thing during your time in BA, this is an experience you must not pass up. Needless to say, we will be telling all our friends about it. The only negative was that it had to eventually end!"

I travel to Buenos Aires once a year for business and this past December I was looking to try something new and outside of the city, and with the Polo Open that weekend, Polo fever was in the air. Only going off of other Trip Advisor recommendations, I signed up for Polo Day, having no idea what to expect and with zero polo or horse riding experience. Let me say this, and I will say this one time: Best. Travel. Experience. Ever. Celia and her husband Ruben were the most gracious hosts when we first arrived, everything exceeded expectations. We saw a great match, ate amazing food (best empanadias I had during my trip) and met some new friends. On this particular day a freak rainstorm came through and unfortunately the afternoon lessons were postponed. Any other tourist operation might have just said, well sorry! Nothing we can do. Not Ruben. Instead, he created a warm place for us to wait out the rain, and when it became clear the fields were too dangerous for the horses, we were all invited back at no extra charge. When I came back a few days later, I ended up getting a private lesson to make up for the rain. I was actually happy the circumstances turned out the way it did! To sum it up, I hate tourist stuff. Argentina Polo Day is as real and authentic as it gets. You can tell the passion and love Celia, Ruben and their staff have for the sport, the animals and sharing that with others. I can't wait to come back in October or November!"

From the very beginning the visit co-ordination was professionally handled and executed. We were picked up early from our hotel in BA and transported to the estancia. We were greeted by English speaking staff and fed delicious empanadas and wine (and plenty of both!) There was plenty of room for the kids (10 and 8) to run around, see the horses, and play with the dogs. We then watched a polo game ... the kids got to throw the ball in more than once, and my son got to ride on a pony with a player! Then it was time for lunch (asado), which was plentiful and delicious! They did have veg. options if needed. We all changed after lunch and got ready to ride and \"play\" polo. We were on the horses for almost 2 hours and had tons of instruction. My husband had never been on a horse, but he was able to gallop at the end of the day! After about 7 hours, we were ready to head home after a FANTASTIC day. The only negative was that the pool, which my kids would have used, was filthy. Excellent service, and great value!

She even emailed us after the trip to make sure we were satisfied and to wish us a Happy New Year. The day itself was blisteringly hot but Claudia and the team looked after us so well that it barely mattered. Lots of fine food including fantastic empanadas and Argentinian steak BBQ, drinks, wine and really good instruction in the basics of polo. We got to watch a full game, try out the strokes on the ground, and then give it a go on horseback. I set my standards low not being a horserider and achieved my goal of actually hitting a ball from the saddle. It was a really fun day and gave us great insight into this particular area of Argentinian culture."

At the beginning I thought we could maybe have a short ride and shoot one or two balls. At the end we played a real match and we could discover how intense and enthralling Polo is. It is of course better to have some basics of riding but even a complete beginner (there were 3 in our group of 5) can have fun. The horses are very calm and won't freak out in a stressful situation.

I was looking into how to see a real polo game in an arena and stumbled over this, try polo yourself! I was hooked! It was a bit on the pricey side but I know how unique this experience is so I convinced my boyfriend to come and play polo with me, he is NOT a experienced rider. The layout of the day was perfect. Pick up from your hotel, wine and yummy empanadas for a welcome snack. Nice English speaking guides taught us the basics of the sport when the club members had a game. I must say this is high action! Players and horses chase that ball as if there is no tomorrow, really cool to see. During the pauses we practised hitting the ball from the ground.After the game we had a great asado lunch. With our bellies full, maybe too full, we got our horse for the day. We got help from the polo guys to manoeuvre our horses and hit the ball. As an experienced rider I had hoped that the horse was a bit more eager to run. She didn't want to canter unless one of the guides rushed her on. (The horses know who's the boss). But we got it going and with some help from the guide I managed to get a few swings on the ball in gallop and it was so much fun and soo exhausting! I just wished I had better endurance so I could have lasted longer! My boyfriend also had a great time. Having a club and a ball to focus on made him forget that he can't ride so he was chasing the ball like a pro ;). When we couldn't swing our clubs any more and hardly stay on the horse it was time to regretfully dismount. Thank the horses and hand them over to the horse keepers. As the finale we had drinks and chit chat in the shade until we wanted to leave the ranch. No rush from a stressed out driver which was very appreciated.So why am I only giving this an average rating? It's because I want Argentina Polo Day to improve on three things:1: Clean the pool! Would have rated this very good if it was nice and clean.2: Some of the horses was unnecessary skinny. I'm aware that these hoses work hard and are not spoiled pet horses. I also know that there are differences in horse keeping in different countries. But it would have given a way better impression if all the horses looked more well fed, at least to us horse lovers. So less ribs would have got an excellent. 3: Being a safety concerned Swede I think that helmets should have been offered. Even if the horses are nice they are still living creatures that can do unpredictable things and a polo ball is really hard. For our comfort there could also have been gloves to lend.For the price we are paying I expected more in these departments, but I would still definitely recommend this to people looking for a really unique experience in Buenos Aires! ... Just remember to stretch afterwards... ;)"

So my welcome by her husband and owner of the Polo Club, Ruben and his team of hosts was as ebullient and warm as if we had known each other for years.Moreover, when we were treated to welcome drinks and later a BBQ lunch with wonderful Argentinian wines, the winemaker from Mendoza whose wines are featured during the day, was sitting next to me, explaining the finer details of his wines. My birthday feeling got even better!In the morning we had viewed a 4 chukka polo game, with helpful explanatory commentary from the hosts and after this, we were given short sticks and balls and fell about laughing (literally), trying to hit the ball and not the divots. But after lunch it was our time to get onboard our ponies with our individual instructors.This is a very strong point of Argentina Polo Day: I am a somewhat nervous older rider trying to learn to play polo. My instructor remained flexible and patient when at first I did not easily get into the steady canter and in the end I cantered around with confidence. I even managed to hit the ball with a stick while mounted, a real breakthrough for me! A true birthday present.As a director of a horse riding holiday business in Andalucia (Aguamarga Riding Adventures and The Writing Horse) I also can the Polo Club is run well, with proper gear and attention to safety and the well-being of the horses and clients.And the willingness of the owner and hosts to stay behind, hang out with the guests (by now:friends) and talk over the events of the day is amazingly dedicated.I have booked my return already and this time my husband is coming with me. So Celia and Ruben, get those empanadas grilling, that Mendoza wine flowing and my lovely pony saddled up!! See you in January!"

By subscribing for the tour I was first exceptionally fast and nicely treated by Celia, Rubens wife/girlfriend (?). She gave all the information I needed and assured me that it was fine to do this alone without any horsebackriding experience (which was indeed the case). Furthermore the day was perfectly organized with excellent food, extremely friendly staff and an opportunity to see a polo match and to practice the polo game yourself. For all activities enough time was scheduled. For me personally this was the first time on a horse, which already made it an amazing experience, but the combination with the polo game really made it supercool! I would highly recommend this (and furthermore I would advise to do the whole day tour, since half a day is, in my opinion too short and too much traveling)"

The driver picked us up promptly at 11am in a nice comfortable minibus and off we went on a little over 1 hr drive to the polo fields near Pilar. The grounds were nice and the staff we were treated by exceptionally friendly staff. Reuben started us off with some tasty empanadas and a glass of vino! Great way to start the day if you ask me.Then we got a crash course in polo and its basic rules (I must admit that I knew almost nothing about polo going into this). Afterward ou crash course we got to watch the pros go at it for about an hour. They made it look so easy! (Our host provided sun screen and bug repellent which was helpful). Next we had a delicious as ado lunch and got to know the other folks joining us for the day. Great food and conversation. After lunch it was our turn to mount up and play a match! I have to say, polo is way way way harder than it looks. There's a great deal of skill involved. Getting the horse to go where you want, trying to hit a small not so round ball while moving on a 500 lb animal with a 5 ft long stick. Yea, way harder than I imagined. But, even though I pretty much stink at polo, we had an absolute blast doing it! After our mini match, we took a short ride and rounded up some other horses from a field, which was fun too! Capped it all off with a quick dip in the pool to cool off (it was a pretty hot day).The ride back to BA was a bit longer on the way back due to traffic, stopping for fuel, and we were the last passengers to be dropped off. Nevertheless, we got to nap a bit on the ride back which was good.Definitely recommend this if you are looking for something different to do outside of BA."

I couldn't have asked for a better place to spend it. We watched a polo match, then learned the tricks of the trade. Followed by a lovely BBQ lunch with some lovely Argentinian wine. The horses were fantastic to ride very calm but responsive. We had two beginner level riders in the group and they enjoyed the riding as much as the more experienced riders. We were taught how to hold the polo sticks and have a go on the horse with the ball control and excellent tuition. The friendliness and warmth of the leaders and polo players made it a very special day. Can't wait to visit again !"

If you have a spare day in Buenos Aires and want to do something really different, authentic, and fun, then look no further.So, if you're anything like me, this is your checklist. 1) You're in Argentina and you want to experience polo: tick. The first thing you get is a pretty competitive looking game played by a mixture of keen, expert amateurs and a few ex-pros. 2) You want to understand polo: tick. You have hosts talking you through the game and the rules so you know what's going on. 3) You want to understand a bit about the culture and the players: tick. The players were incredibly generous with their time after the game and talked to us about their background, the polo circuit, and their experiences playing in different countries. 4) You want to be well fed and watered while all this is going on, after all you're in Argentina, right? Tick. Greeted with some amazing empanadas straight off the grill, followed by quality red wine, soft drinks, and the amazing parilla - that was actually some of the tastiest meat I had on my trip. Finally, 5) you want to play polo. No, really, you do. Big tick. Even if you haven't been on a horse for twenty years, even if you've never been on a horse before, you can come here and try a game. This was one of the best things I've done. Reading the reviews, I thought that maybe 'playing polo' would involve trying to hit the ball while sat on a horse. Wrong - it's much more competitive. The ponies are fantastic and suitable for all levels. Tori and two of the grooms played with us and made an effort to make sure we were all involved in the game - apart from Juan, who was just massively competitive, which made it all the sweeter when our 'girls' team scored! It's a little way out of the city - a couple of hours drive from the centre of Buenos Aires. We got picked up from our hotel, the driver was there on time, and the route is on pretty smooth main roads.Celia took care of booking and was a pleasure to deal with - very prompt, attentive, she made it easy to book even while we were travelling. Ruben is your host for the day and his enthusiasm and love for the sport inspires and sets the tone for the whole experience. Tori and Louise were our guides and they were very friendly and knowledgeable. Thank you to everyone!"

Not only was the host and hostesses warm, funny, and always ready to fill your glass and plates with yumminess, but we played polo! On real Argentine Polo ponies! I wish we had video taped our session. (Remember to do that!) The soundtrack of our game was filled with laughter and broken spanish. The horses were amazing to ride. We were amazed at how they turned \"on a dime\" and would willingly gallop towards the trees if asked. The horses and guests are treated with respect and affection.

My partner has only be sitting on a horse once before and he loved it and enjoyed as much as I did. It is honestly suitable to every level of riding. In between watching the guys playing a proper polo match, we had our first go with the ball and stick before lunch. The amazing Asado was unforgettable and the wine just went with it. And then it was our turn to have a go on horseback. After an initial introduction we played our first game and it was thrilling. We also had the choice for a ride through the enclosed fields, which were still party flooded due to heavier rains earlier. The gallops were amazing!!!!We enjoyed every second and if we would have had an extra day in Buenos Aires we would have gone again. I truly can recommend the Polo Day! The horses, the people, the food and the surroundings are just perfect."

It is all very low-key and fun. We really had a great time. The only thing you should expect is a long ride there and back. It took us close to 2 hours in a pretty cramped van driving from central Buenos Aires to the hacienda. It also took 1.5 hours to drive from there to the airport (and we had no traffic). Just brace yourself for that; it's completely worth while, though."

We were greeted promptly at the polo club with delicious empanadas and yummy wine and Ruben & Tory proceeded to explain the details of the game. We watched a \"condensed\" version of a polo match (due to muddy conditions of the larger fields) however, the players played as hard a game as I have seen. The wine flowed freely as we practiced our polo swings with short mallets on the ground which was a snapshot of the real game. The BBQ lunch was delicious and then it was our turn to play! From the beginning it was an adjustment to swing a mallet alongside the patient horse I rode, but after a little time, everyone's confidence built and we had a blast. I highly recommend this as a fabulous day trip from BA into the country. It is well organized, very comprehensive, and most importantly, exactly what you hope the day will be!! Enjoy!"

We did not know what to expect when we first arrived at the polo field in the middle of no where; based on the muddy conditions and remote feeling of the place we did not expect much. The day ended up being the most fun filled day I experienced in many many years. Being polo fans from the U.S. we were excited to see polo played by an entire team of expert players from the worlds capital of polo, Argentina. Unfortunately because of extensive rains the polo match was played on a much smaller than regulation polo field which was still filled with many large muddy sections. Still is was great to see the players ability to quickly maneuver their polo ponies and the polo ball like they were puppets on strings. After the match we had an enjoyable BBQ lunch, not great food but great people. After lunch we all mounted the polo ponies and attempted to play a game of polo. We all looked like we were moving in slow motion compared to the expert players. After a few minutes we actually were able to attempt playing a very simple game of polo, it felt like riding the bumpers cars in an amusement park. It was a complete blast, I would recommend it to anybody."

Most polo clubs in Argentina are pretty exclusive and virtually closed to non-members, so the mere chance to get to visit one is a rare opportunity. The fact that you not only get to visit this polo club and watch a match up-close, but also get to get on a horse yourself and try playing is just wonderful! The English-speaking hosts also do a great job of answering questions and explaining polo, so if you're new to the sport (as I was, on my first visit here), then it's a great introduction.Drivers from the club pick you up right at your hotel in Buenos Aires, and then it's a 45-minute drive out of the city to the pretty estancia. If you're visiting BsAs for a few days, this is a great chance to escape the chaos of the capital, get some fresh air, and see another side of Argentina.They welcome you at the farm with fresh-made empanadas and wine and beer, then provide a nice introduction to polo. After that, you get to watch a polo match played by the club members. It's really exciting to get to sit right next to the field, with the horses running so close! After that, there's a wonderful asado\u2014or traditional Argentine barbecue\u2014with all kinds of steak, sausages, and other meat. They also make great grilled vegetables and salads. It's terrific! The lunch alone is nearly worth the admission price. Even at the best restaurants in Buenos Aires, you don't get to actually see a traditional parilla (or grill) like this one, which resembles an outdoor fireplace. It's cool to see. After that, you get a chance to get on horseback and try playing polo yourself. Typically, after about a half hour of getting used to your horse, the staffers will come and play with you. The whole day culminates in a scrimmage between staffers and guests. It's really thrilling! I'm from the U.S. but have been living in Buenos Aires for about a year. I've had a lot of friends and family members come to visit me during this time, and I've taken almost all of them to Polo Day. Again and again, they've told me it's been a major highlight of their trip, and I jump at the chance, each time, to get to go experience this wonderful outing again! Highly, highly recommended!"

The last ride in Salta was no succes, as the horse didn't listen to me at all. Hilarious scenes off me being parked under/in a tree with really sharp thorns, and me desparetly trying to move the horse, whicht off course didn't happen... After 45 min we arrived at the beautifull estate, and were greeted by the wonderfull crew, off course with wine! And the best empanades we had in argentina...maybe, just maybe, the horseriding will be ok today. We watched a game and got an explanation. It turned out that polo is quite rough and very fast! Off course there were only people in our group who could barely ride a horse, so we had no hope off actually hitting the ball or playing a game. After a great lunch we got on the horses. The horses were great as the reacted actually! No dumb following the leader, but actual riding! After 20 minutes off practising we all got the hang off it and decided to play a game.

My mom loved it and we had a blast. Thank you Ruben, Mile, and everyone else involved in creating such a wonderful Argentine experience!"

This was such a great day out, we were made to feel at home and greeted with wine and empanadas from the asado - what a treat!Then we were able to watch a polo game, and even had a go with the mallets (we did a half day, so we didn\u00b4t get to play, unfortunately).The only thing was that the driver who came to collect us from our apartment in Buenos Aires didn\u00b4t know where he was going...so we arrived late! Make sure you have the address with you before you leave.I would highly recommend Argentina Polo Day."

We booked this on the back of other reviews and to be honest it was booked as a treat for my wife.We have been travelling for 6 months and this has to be one of the best things we have done. It takes a while to get there if you are the first collection like we were, but when you are greeted with hot empanadas and lovely red wine by the very happy host Mile, you soon forget the drive.It was so much fun and was great to learn more about Polo, which is a great game and certainly lots of fun when playing.To sum up, everything about this day was great - watching polo, playing polo, eating amazing food, drinking lovely wine and being hosted by such lovely and fun people.You can see more on our blog - http://aandbworldtour.blogspot.com.ar/2012/06/day-of-polo.html?spref=fb"

We are a family of 5, parents and 3 young girls (7, 5, and 2) from USA with no horse or polo experience. We had searched and compared all top 3 horse activities ranked from Trip Advisor and decided to go with Ruben. He and his team (Mile, Celia, Omar, etc) were the most passionate people!! They treated us like their own family and there was definitely \"no commercial business involved\". They just want to make sure we had the best experience of a life time and WE DID. It was a \"full day\" activity with Authentic Argentinean BBQ lunch and it was worth every single penny (7 and 5 kids were half price)! We were picked up right in front of our apartment, arrived at the Polo club which was located in the beautiful countryside, were greeted with Ruben with the Best Homemade Empanadas we have ever eaten in our lives!! We just kept eating and eating. Ruben could not speak English so Mile, his assistant, was our personal tour guide. She was sooooo gooood with us and the kids (we wanted to take her back to US with us!). There were also 3 small dogs that our kids could not take their hand off them. We were then taken to the field to see professional polo play. We helped Ruben move the bird eggs out of the field. The kids got to throw the balls to start the polo game. Then, we had wonderful lunch and dessert, practiced polo, and the best part was to ride the horses. First, we thought there would be small horses for our girls but no, they all were big horses. We were scared at first but Ruben and Mile reassured us that the horses were tame and the safety was their most priority. Our 7 and 5 year olds rode the horses with Mile and another gentleman. My 2 year old did not want to ride with anyone but me, mom. Oh no, I was so scared but decided to do it as this would be once in a life time experience. They took us for about an hour ride. We went everywhere including the shallow swamp on the field. Mile and Ruben always kept an eye on us to make sure our safety was at the highest. It was the best! My 2 years old slept on the horse. So, we dropped her off. My girls decided to go on their own with no adult with them on 2 separate horses for another hour. My husband had a blast as he got to play polo on the horse. Once again, no one in our family has ridden horse or play polo before whatsoever. The girls did not want to get off the horses. And, Mile made sure that they could ride as long as they want. They would never ever rush us to end the day. Around 6pm, we all decided that we had enough. The hardest part was to say goodbye as we felt so attach to everyone. We were dropped off by Omar around 7pm right in front of our apartment. The girls said they wanted to come back to visit Ruben, Mile, and Omar again. Sure, if we come back to Buenos Aires, first thing we will definitely do is to visit our friends at Argentina Polo Day!!"

Looking forward to getting out of the city for the day, we did Argentina Polo Day a few weeks ago as part of an extended stay in Buenos Aires / Argentina. The pick-up in the city was in a comfortable van and on time (and not until about 10:30am, to let us sleep in after a Friday night out!). It was refreshing to get out of the van at polo club in the \"campo\" - about an hour outside the city, and everyone there was super friendly and helpful, and a ton of fun. The two hosts did a great job integrating our group, which was 6 backpackers and a family of 4, and it was great to meet and the share the experience with other travelers. It felt very \"authentic\" to drink mate while watching a game of polo at the polo club, then relax for an asado lunch. The highlight, though, was definitely the chance to play a \"real\" game of a polo with the rest of the group, the two hosts, and one of the guys from the club \u2013 although I personally couldn't go too fast on my horse (I'd only ridden about 5 times ever before), the game was much \"realer\" than I expected! Highly recommend the experience overall \u2013 one-of-a-kind if you're spending any time in Buenos Aires and / or Argentina!"

Once we arrived we were greeting by the AMAZING staff. We got a brief on the game and all of the rules while sipping on Malbec and eating baguette, cheese and meats. We were then escorted to the field to watch professionals play. Between each chucker, we practiced hitting the ball with mini mallets. After the game we were treated to a real authentic Argentinan barbecue - WHAT A TREAT! I have never seen so much meat in my life! After lunch we warmed up over some hot coffee and made our way back to the field. We had a very brief lesson on how to ride the horses and hold our mallets properly and then we were off! I don't remember laughing and smiling as much as I did on that field! A great day for anyone who likes a little adventure!"

My boyfriend and I had several questions and Celia couldn\u2019t have been better to communicate with. Don\u2019t miss this experience!!!Recap of the day: You are picked up in the morning right from your apartment/hotel and then off to the ranch which is about an hour drive. They keep the group of people relatively small and we met great people, so that was a great bonus. You arrive at the ranch and you are greeted by everyone who is part of the Polo Club ran there and handed wine and empanadas (pretty much the best ones I had in Argentina). Then you watch the club members play a match (continue to drink wine). Beware there are LOTS of mosquitoes. I was eaten alive!! Wear thick jeans even if it\u2019s hot. They have bug spray there. After watching the game you are lead to the large tables outside to eat carne asado style. It\u2019s delicious and the guy cooking is a former chef. There so much to eat you will be stuffed. After all of this you have the chance to play polo yourself. There were a few people who had never been on a horse including my boyfriend, but don\u2019t worry, there are several people to give you advise and quick lessons on how to ride and play. There are also several horses and they will change your horse if you need a better one. After an hour or two riding you are done for the day (drink more wine if you want) and then you return tired and fully satisfied to BA."

Ruben and Mile are HYSTERICAL and made the 2 days such fun and a great Argentinian memory for me and my husband.

We were grouped into those who had and had not ever ridden before, although I'm not sure why - the distinction meant nothing within 5 minutes. The horses were spirited polo ponies and were not suited to beginners AT ALL. Safety was given scant regard - there were not enough helmets to go around and so a good few of us (me included) had to go without. Given that one fall from a horse can break your neck, this wasn't reassuring. The lunch was pretty low quality and the pool at the ranch was not the one on the advert...in fact it was full of debris and looked at first glance like a drinking pond for the horses.

We decided on polo based on the reviews and our expectations were met and then some. We were picked up on time, shuttled to the site where we were welcomed with empanadas and wine. Everything throughout the day was well orchestrated and centered around its participants. I would highly recommend this day long event!"

We had a great time there is definately an experience to remember and you get a lot for your money!"

We came across Argentina Polo Day and thought it sounded too good to be true. When we checked the reviews on Tripadvisor and they were all great, we booked immediately.We were picked up from our hotel in BA and were driven to the ranch, which is about 45 minutes outside the city. We arrived and were welcomed by an english speaking guide and the owner of the club. We got a tour of the house and grounds and were brought to the field were we sat under the sun and drank wine and watched the 3 groomsmen play against 2 club member and the owner. It was my first time seeing a polo match and it was amazing. Each guest got to throw in the ball to start the match. After the game, which lasted about an hour, we went back to the house and enjoyed a bbq outside. I am a vegetarian and they were very accomodating. After the meal, we got to get on horses and play our own game of Polo. I was nervous about how I would be on the horse but they were very gentle. We practiced hitting the ball and then proceeded to play a game. It was so much fun! There is a pool but we were so busy with the horses, we didn't use it.Definitely one of the highlights of my trip."

            "review": "Awesome Experience. A Must Do in BA.. I traveled to BA in February, 2012 and came across the opportunity to learn/play a little polo through Argentina Polo Cay. I wasn't sure what to expect. It ended up being the highlight of my trip! The club is located about 40 minutes outside of town. They picked me up at my hotel. On arrival, an English-speaking guide met us and we (there were three guests that day) were given the opportunity to wander around the grounds. There is an asado area were lunch was being set up. A \"club\" area with a living area, restroom, and some beds upstairs for overnight guests, and of course, area for the horses kept on site.After we were given drinks (It was a bit too early for the wine offered, and I wanted to be able to stay upright on my horse later.), we were led to the smaller of the two polo fields maintained there. A table and chairs were set up and waiting. Two teams assembled, and we watched a polo match. I knew nothing about polo, so it was as educational as it was entertaining. Our guide explained the rules as the game went on. Polo is much more intense than I ever imagined!After the game, we had a wonderful asado cooked by the proprietor. It was great. Then the wine flowed. (I needed a little confidence for what was coming.) After lunch, we were given instruction on how to hold the mallets and generally the basics of playing the game, saddled up and went back to the field. Some balls were thrown into the field, and we started learning to play the game. (It's not nearly as easy as the veterans made it look, but not so hard that you couldn't whack a ball occasionally.)After a half hour or so of getting use to swinging a mallet from the back of a horse, we divided into teams and played a game. Each team was filled out with experienced players. It wasn't a particularly competitive game (other than to Diego, who felt obligated to prevent my from striking the ball every time I seemed to have an opening!) from a scoring standpoint. We chased the ball up and down the field and occasionally, goals were scored. It was simply amazing. I had never ridden a horse in such a manner, and when combined with the coordination it requires to hit the ball or prevent your opponent from doing so (defense plays a huge part in the game), I was completely absorbed. I played aggressively (I had Diego to contend with) to make up for my lack of skill. The experienced players toyed with me, but it was all in good fun. I had a ridden horses quite a bit, but that's not required. You play at your own pace. If you don't want to mix it up with the experienced players, you certainly don't have to.After an hour or so of playing, we went back to the club for refreshments. Depending on how you play, the game can be pretty demanding. (And think about the horse!) Anyway, it was an absolute blast. I would have gone back the next day.This is truly a don't miss experience. Argentina is the epicenter of world polo. This opportunity to learn and actually play a sport that is played in so few places in the world is really a treat."

It was truly amazing how nice and hospitable Ruben and his staff were to make our day memorable. A bit skeptical that this was going to be a tourist trap but to be honest it was far from that it was a day to remember. The reality was that this was a great way to learn about Argentina and its love for Polo. After weeks of research I selected this company because of the opportunity not only to play Polo but to see a game of Polo.The day started off by Ruben( the owner) sharing with our group the facts and basics of Polo and of course a few glasses or wine and oven baked empanadas. This is always a great way to welcome any guest with food and wine!After our warm welcome our group was seated on the sidelines of the Polo field to watch the Polo match with more wine and empanadas. It was so much fun, and amazing to see a a game in full action as it was my first time and I had front row seats. More than the front row seats I gained an appreciation for the players and the horses as this is truly a difficult sport.After the Polo game we celebrated with a fabulous lunch with the players and Ruben. Not sure why other people have said that the lunch was not great because that is far from the truth the food and wine was a great typical Argentina parillada ( BBQ). Loved it!!After Lunch and wine, we all got geared up to play Polo. Wow Polo is a difficult sport that requires strength and endurance especially in 90 degree weather. I truly appreciated the sport after playing it I am only 30 years old and in good shape and it kicked my butt. Thanks to everyone at Argentina Polo day you were all amazing !!!!Thus, I truly recommend Ruben and his company to anyone visiting Argentina. It is worth the time and money I promise you will not regret."

Ruben, Celia and their team are friendly, knowledgeable hosts who provide a great introduction to so many of the best-loved aspects of Argentine culture: polo; delicious asado (bbq), wine, and empanadas; and leisurely afternoons in the sun. I have been living in Buenos Aires for several months and this is one of the most interesting things I've done - not least for the opportunity to get on a horse and take a crack at playing polo. The Polo Day site is less than an hour from Buenos Aires, but worlds away with lots of green, fresh air, and quiet. It's a really unique and authentic experience - the whole team is Argentine and everyone grew up with horses and polo - definitely a worthwhile break from the crush of the city (and they will arrange transport!)"

The ride out was a little nerve wracking as the driver looked too sleepy to be driving, But after we arrived, we were greeted with wine and a light snack of meats and cheeses. The lunch was amazing, the hosts gracious. The polo lesson was a little loose, it would have been helpful to get a few more specific tips instead of running about and trying to keep up with the best horsemen and the \"real\" polo players. Still, it was great fun. The customer service experience before and after was excellent--a rapid fast response to my initial email, and a willingness to refund prepaid fees for a last minute cancellation.

The whole concept and day activity was memorable. This is a whole day activity. Also, feel free to bring your swimsuit to take advantage of the pool.The day starts with being picked up from your hotel and driven about 45 minutes out to a ranch. At the ranch you are greeted with wine, sodas, and small meat snacks that were fire-grilled. You're introduced to a few of the polo players and you go to the polo field to watch a pick-up game, and even get to participate by throwing in the polo ball. After this is done, you go back to eat a lunch. This was my main and ONLY complaint of the day. I am a healthy eater, but the food that was served, that primarily consisted of many different meats was some of the FATTIEST meats I've ever seen. It literally is barely edible unless you want to eat pure fat. I would recommend to the owners to serve higher quality meats. But there are enough other things to eat to fill up a stomach and as much wine as you can consume. After lunch, you suit up with polo gear (Helmet and shin guards, and polo stick), and mount your trusty steed to play your own pick up game with the others that were a part of the group for the day. We were probably playing somewhere around an hour, enough that the horse gets tired before you, so the time playing was PLENTY adequate.Overall, I would unhesitatingly recommend this activity to do while in BA. There's not too many places where you can participate in such an elite sport. It's a MUST DO!"

After the game we had lunch under a covered patio with steaks(excellent) and sausages(also excellent) , grilled and perfectly seasoned vegetables,a tossed salad , fresh bread along with more wine. Loved the grilled eggplant.  After lunch it was horse time for the rest of us. I hadn't been on a horse since I was thrown from one years ago. I did manage to get on and feel somewhat confident about that thanks to Janie another great rider who works there.Some of our group were very good riders and had ridden and played before but most of us hadn't. The horses were very docile. After our \"polo\" game we returned to the main house to cool off in the inground pool.

Rosie was able to answer all of our questions on the rules etc.After the game we sat down for lunch which was a BBQ of various Argentinian meats - steak, sausages, chorizo, black pudding. It was really nice. This was served with salads and more wine.Then in the afternoon we had a mini game of polo ourselves. All the gear is provided. You should just be sure to wear jeans and not shorts. We were novice riders so we started with basic riding tips and then practising hitting the ball. Then we had a short game.

We felt pretty posh eating and drinking wine while watching the match. It was very cool to watch experts. Afterwards we had lunch. To be honest the lunch wasn't very good. It consisted of a very simple salad, a few sausages and very fatty ribs. We were hoping for a little more especially with how much we paid. But we quickly forgot about it when we got on the horses. Playing polo was amazing although a little more instruction before getting on the horse would have been beneficial. We ended up having a blast and had a great day. Keep in mind they only take cash which was a little inconvenient. And it's definitely better to pay in American dollars. I would definitely recommend this to everyone!! Have fun!"

To which I reply: Soy de Nueva Zelandia and normally their face lights up and the next word they say is: Rugby!! Well rugby is to New Zealand what Polo is to Argentina. They are the best polo players in the universe and their national team has not lost a championship since... wait for it... 1932.Traditionally, polo is practised on the family estancias (ranches) all over the country so you can imagine my excitement when I had the opportunity to visit Argentina Polo Day at \"El Camino\", a 20 acre farm located in Pilar (Buenos Aires Province) last Wednesday to learn to play polo.On arrival, I meet the owner Ruben, a friendly and polo-passionate character who looks like he's just stepped out of a Ralph Lauren advertisement. The first thing he put in my hand after shaking it was a glass of Malbec Argentine wine and then an empanada, freshly from the coal fire bbq. He explained the format of the day, firstly a snack and refreshment, followed by watching an exhibition polo game and then anasado (traditional Argentine bbq) for lunch and finally it would be our turn to get on a horse and whack mallets.As we sat on a shady spot on the side of the pitch, one of the English speaking hosts, Rosie explained the rules to me. Imagine playing hockey on horseback and you've got a pretty good picture of what polo is like. But it's much harder than hockey because there's no goalie and only three or four players per team. Plus there's the fact you're trying to convince a four-legged animal to chase a ball and risk a mallet in the head for their efforts. (Even the horses wear shinguards.) The outdoor polo field is 274 metres long and 182 metres wide, the largest field in organised sport. The game I watched involved three people per team team and four periods, called chukkers of ten minutes each. They have to swap the horse every chukker so that means for six people you need 24 horses, no wonder it's a game for the rich and famous! Players are given handicaps like in Golf and they range from -3 (beginner) to 10 (pro). I was at 'El Camino' with a lovely French family on their holidays and while it was their first time playing polo, they have horses back home that they regularly ride. Watching the players hurtling towards each other, mallet weapons flying, I began wondering if playing the dangerous sport of polo would be covered by my travel and health insurance!? My fear was sidetracked by a delicious asado of barbecued ribs, chorizo sausage, salad, slow-roasted veges and of course, Malbec vino. It's a beautiful outdoor dining setting and after a leisurely lunch we kitted up for the game ahead.The French family and I lined up for a team photo, leaning on our bamboo mallets and the next thing I knew I had mounted a horse and was on the field. We started with some stick-and-ball where you repeatedly practice trying to hit the ball along the ground. The coordination necessary to get your horse at the right distance from a moving target, leaning down, making contact with ball and not falling off the horse is quite immense. However after 10 minutes of gentle hitting (and missing!) the game begun and the groomsmen all joined in and showed us the ropes and reins of how to play. I'd like to say I was a pro instantly but like other high-skill sports like golf or surfing, there's a steep learning curve. However, the best bit for me was that even as a complete novice I was able to trot around the place, making occasional ball contact and enjoying the thrill of the game. The horses are incredibly well trained and after half an hour I wasn't even thinking about the riding part of it, just the chasing and hitting.The Argentina Polo day crew love polo, they live and breathe it every day and are happy to share their passion and expertise with novices like me. The food, the exhibition match and the game we played made me feel a part of their world for a day. But never fear Meg (my bicycle), I'm not quite ready to swap my two wheels for four legs just yet!"

This is a simple place with a lot of passion for the game. If you are looking for the whole \"show\", (dancing, big lunch with 100 people, etc), this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for a hands on Polo experience, with great horses, amazing lunch, and super friendly/passionate people, this place is amazing. Thank you Ruben for opening the doors to your polo club. We will be back next year. Luis"

I was invited by two friends to do A POLO DAY activity in Pilar (25 km) away from Buenos Aires city, I did not what to expect but I acknowledge that Polo is a big sport in Argentina.So I decided to accept my friends\u00b4 invitation, Once we got there we were welcomed by Ruben (the owner), such a great guy and very friendly dude, he welcomed us with some Empanadas and a glas of Malbec (best wine), he is short of English but he employs Rosy from England, she is great and gave us some info about the HAcienda and a lot of info about POLO sport.. it turned out to be a great and amazing day, we had a Polo lesson, watched a Polo game, played a Polo game and had great Argentine Barbecue plus a lot of wine... the staff is great, very friendly.. Polo is an expensive sport so for what we paid it, we had amazing deal.. it costed only 160 U$ for the day but it is worthy, I would totally recomend this activity even if you are not big fan of Polo, I warrant it, You will a great day and have a lot of fun... So if you are in Buenos Aires and want to have a great and unique Polo experience, do not hesitate to contact this guys... www.argentinapoloday.com.arPepe."

For us it started with the super-friendly and helpful driver that picked us up at our apartment in BA. We picked up one other couple at a nearby hotel then hit the highway for a short 45min drive to the polo ranch/club. We arrived and are immediately welcomed like family at your uncle\u2019s ranch. We\u2019re greeted by the owner and a handful of the club members. We\u2019re handed a bottomless glass of wine and sit on the sidelines to enjoy a friendly little game of polo with an assortment of meats and cheeses, and more wine. After the game we sit around a table by the grill and have some of the most wonderful food for lunch; and more wine. Afterwards, we head out to the stables, grab a mallet and a helmet, pick our horse and head back out to the field to learn some polo; first hand. The time flew by so fast, before we knew it the sun had begun to set. We hop off our horses and sat on the patio for some refreshing beverages\u2026 and more wine. We then, reluctantly, say our goodbyes, thank our hosts, and hop in the car for the driver to take us back to our doorstep in the city. It was absolutely a fantastic experience; fun, relaxing, comfortable. Highly recommend. Three things one shouldn\u2019t miss when visiting Argentina: the vineyards of Mendoza, the glaciers of Patagonia, and Polo Day."

I used to be a show jumper in the Netherlands and I would like to learn how to play polo during my time in Argentina. Well, I could say that this place is the perfect place to do so! Ruben (the owner of the club) and the others are very professional teachers. I stayed at their place for two days, got trainings, played small matches (calle baby-chacka's) and I even brought 20 horses from the pampa to their stables riding on another horse. Together with the great meals, swiming pool, sleeping facilities and the members of the polo club (who are hanging around the club during the day and are really interesting people) makes these two days an unforgetable experience!"

We booked the day of polo but when we got there and realised you can stay overnight at the camp we wished had done that. Reuben and celia, the couple who run the camp (along with their cute little daughter), were so friendly and welcoming. We were made to feel at ease as soon as we arrived with a welcome of wine and juicy empanadas. The wonderful Rosie, who is the jewel in their crown at the moment (a young English girl who has lots of experience with horses and plays polo as well as any argentinian male), explained everything to us and helped us learn the rules of the game while watching a match between some club players which was a pretty full on passionate affair. As two girls with little or no horse riding experience it was encouraging to have rosie there to help feel less daunted by the prospect of playing polo!! Over lunch - a stream of barbecued meats and veg with plentiful wine - we got to know the family and some of their polo playing friends better and relaxed in the gorgeous surroundings. Afterwards we got kitted out ourselves and got straight on to the horses. Having never ridden in my life, Rosie made me feel totally at ease. I was initially disappointed that there were only 3 people in the group one of whom was my friend. But we got lots of attention and one of the polo players even took my camera and took lots of photos of us playing polo. We got a little instruction as to how to ride the horse but the animals are so well trained, within a few minutes we were being shown how to hit the ball. It was so much fun, although we played a limited game as my friend and I could barely get the horses to trot while the other guest was a show jumper. He was staying for 2 days to learn polo and improve his Spanish. All in all we got a bit of everything: a day out of the city, eating great food, learning about Argentinian life, watched a bit of polo and played some ourselves. Oh and all in the company of wonderful warm Argentinian people (and Rosie). We highly recommend this day!! Ps oh and if you don't want to get involved you can chill out by the pool so bring your swimming stuff!"

They picked myself and two friends from our hostel, we picked up other people along the way. I was a little worried that it would be lame because they picked up some unathletic types. It's about an hour outside the city. We arrived to a polo field greeted with best empanads I've eaten down in Argentina. The wine was legit too. As much as you could eat and drink. We watch a polo match, the rules were explained to us in English, but we were to busy stuffing our faces and drinking. Rueben, the owner, road over to us and said hello. He was playing in the match. After the match we went over to the farm house for an argentine BBQ. Here my friends and I ate like a fat kids in the candy store. Food was great! Talked and laughed. Chilled out for 20 min after the BBQ, then we suited up for Polo. I was wondering how it was going to go. The game or match was intense when we watched it. We are all athletic but have zero horse experience. Plus the other people that came had even less by the looks of it. They took us to a field after a short instruction on how to ride a horse, like a 30 sec on how to do it. We played with rueben and the other polo players. They helped us and played to everyone's level. I laughed so hard it hurt. Rueben is hillarious and cheats like crazy. I scored 3 goals, no big deal. Even the people that were really out of their element had a great time. One person did everything but played and she loved watching us. We played for almost 2 hours. I was tired and ready for some schlep. If I ever go back, it's a definite. The things I would do differently are bring a glove for your dominant hand that you swing the polo stick with. Like a batting glove or golf glove, wear jeans although my buddy wore board shorts, and if your have boots with a heel like cowboy boots. I wore sneakers and it worked. Just would've made riding the horse easier. The have gear but it's limited and plus it doesn't fit 3 meat head guys that well. It was awesome and well worth it. Plus I won't feel like a poser when I wear a polo shirt next time."

First off, I'm afraid of horses and have never ridden one but I'm so glad I decided to do this. Everyone at the company is super nice and offered us wine/empanadas as soon as we arrived at the ranch. The next hour consisted of us watching them play competitive game of polo while teaching us rookies about the rules. The following BBQ lunch was delicious and it was fun to be able to kick back and learn more about the Argentinian culture from some true locals. We spent the last hour or so actually riding the horses and playing a \"game\" which must have looked ridiculous to an outsider since most of our horses were walking -- only because they knew we were beginers. The instructors were great! They were helping everyone individually and by the end of the session I was much more comforatable on a horse and really having fun. I recommend this for anyone with a spare day in Buenos Aires!!!"

The cost is $160 (at October 2011, the owners say they have to re-price things often due to persistent inflation in Argentina) which includes transportation to and from your hotel, all you want food & drinks/wine, private polo match as a spectator, one-on-one polo instruction and horse/equipment rental. They pick you up right at your hotel and the drive is about 45-60 mins with a friendly driver (if you speak a little Spanish). I knew right off the bat this was a very family-centric small business as one of our passengers was the driver's daughter. You're greeted with homemade empanadas right off the grill and a nice glass of Malbec, and after quick introductions and an explanation of the basic rules you watch a polo match between two amateur teams. The owners explain that they basically run this as a side business solely to cover the costs of team travel and caring for the horses - these guys are super passionate about polo and don't run this for a profit, just enough to allow them to keep doing what they love. After the match you have a terrific asado (grill-out/barbeque) which they try to keep feeding you until you beg them to stop. Some of the neighbors and polo players from the match joined us for lunch as well and were very friendly and happy to answer questions about polo and their country in general. After lunch you put on your equipment and get some instruction on how to ride / steer the horses and proper swinging technique. Then you're basically let loose to practice hitting the ball on the run as well as getting a good feel for your horse (its remarkably intuitive after just a few minutes, the horses are incredibly well-trained...and understanding of beginner riders). The instructors and staff ride alongside you giving tips, hitting the ball to you, etc. After about a half hour of practice you get to play your very own match on a shortened field with a mix of staff and pupils on each team. Incredibly fun and our match got pretty heated quickly, I hadn't ridden a horse in probably 10 years or ever attempted to play or watch polo and yet I got caught up in the game and immediately understood why the owners love it so much. They also run a week-long polo camp where you stay on-site which I would be sorely tempted to do if I can ever make it back for a long period of time (it also sounds like this doubles as an immersive Spanish course for those looking to improve their language skills). At the end of the day you're driven right back to your hotel....and I have been thinking about this experience ever since."

From there you head back and have a Argentinian BBQ (a meat lovers dream) along with salad/vegetables. If like me you dont eat red meat you're in trouble however within reason email the guys and let them know any requests Im sure they will adapt if needed.After lunch you get a chance to mount a horse and under guidance they will teach you how to play polo.

I had never ridden a horse before, but wanted to join some friends to travel outside of the city. We were recommended Argentina Polo Day, which ultimately surpassed all of my expectations. Travel was provided to and from the polo field, which is less than an hour from the heart of Buenos Aires. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the owners with wine and all-you-can-eat traditional Argentine empanadas. As we sipped on wine and delicious food, we listened to an introduction about the game of polo. It was not long until I was able to get on my own horse, ride her around, and then add in the polo stick to begin playing!! Having no prior experience with horses, I had never expected to be able to play. The horses were very calm and we had great instruction. After a few hours of getting acquainted, we took a long break to enjoy a classic Argentina barbecue (\"asado\"). It was absolutely delicious, and gave us the opportunity to get to know the rest of the group. The rest of the day consisted of more polo and horseback riding, chatting with other people in the group and the owners of Argentina Polo Day (who made the day a laid back, comfortable experience), and watching a live match! When our car arrived to pick us up in the evening, I did not want to leave! I would highly recommend this adventure to anyone visiting the greater BA area. It is an opportunity not to be missed."

My friends and I went on perfect Saturday. In the morning, Celia at Argentina Polo had helped arrange transportation for us from Buenos Aires to the estancia (ranch) which is about 50 minutes away from the BA city center.Once at the estancia, we were greeted personally by Celia and Ruben, the owners of the estanica. The welcomed us with freshly baked empanadas and delicious red wine and took us on a tour of their beautiful property. It was so picturesque - there were dogs, a little girl, a swimming pool, BBQ pit, and green pastures / clear blue sky...the air felt so much crisper and cleaner!!After an introduction to polo, we were soon on wards to our ridding lesson. We each got on a horse without much delay. There was a mix of different ridding levels in our group, but Ruben and his team made sure that we all felt comfortable on our horses (which were gorgeous!). They gave us tips on how to handle the horses and we were soon on our way to riding around the campo with our polo sticks. After our lesson, we headed back to the main house where an asado (BBQ) was being cooked for us on the outdoor grill. It smelled and tasted delicious! For the vegetarians in our group, there was also a great salad and freshly grilled vegetables.Overall, it was not only an incredibly relaxing day, but also one where I also felt that I learned something and did something truly unique \"Argentinian\". I would wholeheartedly recommend this, and have already been doing so with all my friends who are going to BA!"

We got to explore all the major neighborhoods, had a very chill picnic lunch by the water and get all the inside details on the ins and outs of the official and unoffical history of the city. It turns out the day I went , no one else had signed up so I had a one on one with Ray and he was so funny and informative. And also gave me plenty of tips of where to go or eat in the city the rest of my time here. I totally recommend this to anyone, especially at the start of your trip to BA. Worth every penny!"

My guide Marcelo was so knowledgeable that I got a lesson in Argentine history,a lesson in art history, a tour of 3 neighbourhoods and a bicycle tour. It was a wonderful 4 hours. Terrific value for money!! It is sooo much nicer seeing art outside and from a bike rather than driving around or going inside to a gallery. I would highly recommend this. In addition, you get to go to Barracas where it is difficult to go as a tourist alone. Some of the best art is there."

We have done a number of city bike tours around the world and this is by far the best bike tour we have be on. Marcelo was an excellent guide with extensive knowledge about the city and it's history. Even though I have been to Buenos Aires before and have participated in a tour, I came away from this tour with a much better understanding of the history of the city, the different neighbourhoods and Argentina as a whole. Marcelo was also extremely friendly and helpful and was keen to answer any questions you had. The lunch stop was a delightful surprise. We stopped at a Parilla food truck and had the most delicious bbq pork and beef sandwiches which you dressed from a mind boggling selection of toppings and condiments. Both delicious and satisfying (we couldn't eat the whole thing!). The bike riding was done at a leisurely pace on flat terrain. While the streets of BA can be very busy and the driver's at times erratic, Marcelo was very conscious of keeping the group safe. The bike's themselves were in great condition and we were provided with a helmet (mandatory) and complimentary full water bottle. I would highly recommend this bike tour as it is a fun, interactive, leisurely way to explore Buenos Aires."

The tour includes an awesome lunch at a food truck in Puerto Madero. I am vegetarian and they had a veggie option which was awesome! The tour also included mate (a popular tea) which was cool because we had been wanting to try it! The tour provided a bunch of great facts and history about Argentina. Marcelo was a great guide!!! He was extremely knowledgeable about the local culture but also kept the topics light with some fun jokes too. The bikes were super nice and comfortable. It rained during our trip but BBA was prepared and had ponchos for all of us. This was a great tour and well worth the money."

We took what we learned on day 1 from this tour and it made the next 7 days that much more valuable of an experience. Our guide, Rodrigo, did an amazing job with a full circle story about the history of the city and we felt like we got a true local's perspective. He offered tons of recommendations for night life/restaurants/pub crawls etc. All of which we took advantage of and loved. Lunch was awesome as well! Nom Nom. The ride was fun, not physically demanding as the city is flat. No complaints about the bikes whatsoever. Our group was small too, so plenty of opportunity to ask all the random questions about other aspects of our trip. We will definitely recommend to all of our friends."

Do this tour!!!!I was a bit skeptical about how much I would learn on this tour since I had already spent several months in BA, but I LOVED it and really learned a lot! It visits a bunch of the most famous areas and does a really good job explaining the history behind them and generally tying them in with the history of the city/country/region. Even though I had already visited most of the places, I still learned new information and experienced them in a new way. The tour struck the perfect balance of biking around, learning history, and free time to explore on our own. The bikes themselves were nice, with really comfortable seats and good suspension. The helmets they provide kind of look like polo helmets with various fabric coverings, which made me feel slightly better about the whole group tour, matching bikes thing. But the best part about the tour by far is the guides and the level of enthusiasm and professionalism they bring to it. Marcelo, Pepe y Renzo were so great!Marcelo began the tour by showing us where we would be going and what to expect. He got us interested in the information by giving us a little snippet of what we would be learning about in each place (e.g. \"Here I will show you why the Reserva was a happy accident...\"). He clearly knew a ton about Argentine history and was super funny and entertaining! During the tour, we always felt safe because Pep and Renzo would literally block traffic and make sure to put themselves between us and any car that might potentially be headed our way. They also went ahead of us to the lunch location to save us all seats! Lunch was a stop at a food truck, where we sat outside at tables and enjoyed a view of the natural reserve (do yourself a favor and get the sandwich they recommend -- its amazing!).Here is a real illustration of how great these guys are --- after lunch I (stupidly!) left my purse hanging on the chair. Luckily because the tour is so well organized, they had arranged for the next tour to come take our spot at the lunch place. So when I realized what I had done, Renzo just messaged the other group and had them bring my bag back to the office with them. Crisis averted! At the end of the tour, Marcelo followed up with the whole group via email to give us recommendations and advice for further exploring, including specific things we had asked about on the tour. All in all, a great way to explore BA, meet good people, and have a really fun time!"

They took their time to answer any of the many questions we all had about this fascinating city and made sure that we cycled in comfort and safety, even supplying sunscreen and insect repellant. Because of their friendly approach the group (which as well as us included 3 couples from across the globe) all had a great time and bonded over a traditional lunch then on the lawns outside Casa Rosada drinking mate.

He was very personable, shared some of his life with me, and gave very interesting and complete information about Argentina's history with some commentary. So, I learned a ton and had a great time doing it.Also, I got a wealth of detailed, CUSTOM information about what I should do in Buenos Aires while here from Kaylee via their newly started concierge service. I got great ideas I hadn't discovered with days of research, based on what I was interested in. It saved a ton of research time. Overall, great company, great people! One of the best choices I made. I recommend you do this early in your trip, as it will inform and enhance the rest."

There is no way you could have more fun and learn more about both past and present Buenos Aires and Argentina than by going on this bike tour (I did the ultimate city tour). Learn about history, the economy, the politics, the food, the culture all while touring around this beautiful city with its many parks and plazas. Your man is Ray - he has encyclopedic knowledge of this place, its people, its traditions (like mat\u00e9 tea) with a wry, dry sense of humor and that twinkle in his eye that says \"today's going to be an adventure\" :-). The other staff were lovely as well and, even though I made an early morning decision to switch days, they sorted it out for me straightaway.Highly recommended!"

Rodrigo was my guide for the day, and the way it worked out I was the only guest on this particular tour. He was great from start to finish - we saw the colours of La Boca, I got an excellent overview of the history of BA and Argentina as we cycled, stopped off to admire the amazing and varied architecture, shared a Mate tea and had a great lunch. I think we covered about 26kms over the day so not overly strenuous, and I really felt like I saw a huge amount of BA that i would have otherwise missed. Great tour, great guide and really well organised. Thank you!"

Granted, we had pretty much perfect weather (~60-65F/15-18C and sunny), but I think even if the weather weren't great it would still have been a lot of fun. We had a group of seven riders and two guides and did a very comprehensive tour of San Telmo, La Boca, Puerto Madero, a bit of Retiro, Recoleta, and Microcentro. Along the way we learned a mix of history old and new, something about the politics of Argentina, a lot of cultural information explaining how Argentina and Buenos Aires have become the distinct places they are today (Tango! Immigration! Dictatorships!), and how to properly have mate. Our guides were extremely friendly and helpful and watched us like hawks as we navigated the streets of Buenos Aires. And they gave us time to explore different areas on foot along the way. Combine all that with some great exercise, especially needed after the delicious lunch at a food truck in Puerto Madero, and it made for a pretty perfect day."

(Local tour guide: Santi, is EXCELLENT, speaks great English, and pretty much knows EVERYTHING). I'm 28 years old and was with my girlfriend, but the tour had 4 other people ranging from 22-60 years old, and everyone LOVED it.I highly recommend doing one of these tours. We did the Heart of the City Tour, which lasted 5 hours. I think that it is the perfect amount of time, and you get to see a lot of different parts of Buenos Aires, allowing you to soak in the culture. What makes this tour exceptional are the guides; they are SO nice, cool, and knowledgeable. They make the tour educational and fun at the same time. I really don't think there's a better way to explore this city. Just going to major landmarks would only give you a small feel for their culture. Having a local guide paint a beautiful picture of the history of Buenos Aires during your tour allows you to have a true appreciation of the city.You get a lot of biking breaks, and the terrain is pretty flat so it's an easy bike ride. By the end of the day, you feel like you've done a lot, but it's not very strenuous at all. All of the drivers in the city are very respectful of bikers, making the tour very pleasant (and there are lots of bike lanes). If you are still reading this, stop right now and book a tour with Santi (our tour guide) already, I guarantee you will be so happy you did."

The bikes are excellent and have a really comfy seat. They have a basket so you have somewhere to put your water and handbag etc. The cycling was easy because BA is so flat and because much of the time we followed bike paths.

Kaylee & Anne took very good care of our group of 5, while giving us an insiders look into the city, its history, and some really cool local attractions. This experience was a highlight of my 1 week trip to Buenos Aires. Both ladies were extremely knowledgeable and were fantastic guides for our group. I highly recommend this experience to anyone who wants not only a fun but also educational experience that they will not soon forget. Thank you!"

They customized our tour to include stopping at 3 bars, each of which was great. We learned a ton about the city, culture, and people and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the trip. The 3 bar stops were well planned out and we experienced a local drink which we all enjoyed. Our lunch stop was great and both Kaylee and Anne went out of their way to plan this event for us. If you are thinking of doing this, don't hesitate. After our ride was over, Kaylee and Anne followed up with a long email with restaurant and shopping suggestions and provided tips for a group of friends traveling to Chile. They went above and beyond to make our day."

I booked the Heart of the City (South City) tour for my husband and I, and given that it was low season for tourism in Buenos Aires we were lucky enough to get a private tour! Our guide, Rodrigo, did an amazing job. He kept us enthralled with his interesting historical anecdotes and stories about futbol rivalries in Buenos Aires. One of our favorite spots was La Boca, a colorful neighborhood where tango was born and we had the chance to buy some hand-made gifts. We also loved biking through the ecological reserve and seeing the presidential palace. We saw parts of Buenos Aires (like the river shore and La Boca) that we never would have otherwise. We ate lunch next to the river at a choripan stand (choripan is a traditional Argentinian sandwich) and also got to try mate, a traditional Argentinian caffeinated drink. Rodrigo was professional enough to send us a follow-up email with a summary of the different locations on the tour, a list of Buenos Aires recommendations, and a youtube video we had requested. I highly recommend Biking Buenos Aires as a way to experience new parts of this huge city. When you book a tour you are advised to eat a large breakfast--make sure to do that, as we didn't eat lunch until around 2:30!"

We didn't know much about the country beforehand, but Ray gave a nuanced view of the history of Argentina and Buenos Aires, from the city's foundation till today. The tour took 7.5 hours, but we weren't too sore afterwards, BA is a pretty flat city. The city has a lot of bike lanes that run along the streets. Ray and Kayley went first and last respectively and always blocked crossings to get us across safely.Money and time well spent if you want to learn about the city and its people!"

Golmary was so friendly and knew so much about BA. She was lots of fun and I was worried the second tour would be a disappointment but Rodrigo was fantastic too. He was a Porteno and a university student so knew so much of the history of BA. Both tours showed us so much of BA we would have been unable to experience any other way than on a bike. We had beautiful weather and were introduced to mate and Argentinian fast food on the beach."

Very knowledgeable, fun, interesting and took good care of us throughout the day. Great mix of history about both BA and Argentina combined with a good insight into recent events and what it's like to live in the city now. The bikes themselves are comfortable and traffic around the city not a problem (most of the ride on cycle lanes). Lunch was also very tasty."

If you want to see the best of the city and if you like to know some stories behind the famous places, this is the tour to go.

Our bike tour was one of the highlights of our trip. You see so much more touring by bike, and our tour guide (Kaylee) was fantastic. We had already read the guidebooks about the history and sights in BA and already knew quite a bit, but I have to say that we learned a lot of new things and we were entertained in the process. We were initially wondering how it would be to bike a big city like BA, but we felt very comfortable and safe and that our guide was looking out for us and monitoring traffic. You really feel the vibe of the city biking versus being in a tour bus, and you cover so much more ground than walking. Plenty of stops and a great lunch. Our guide was very flexible in making additional stops where we wanted to and answering our questions. This is also a great option if you really want to get a nice overview of the city but you don't have a lot of time (we only really had one full day in BA). If we had more time, we would have liked to have taken some of their other bike tours, which also look very interesting and fun."

We only had a day in BA before going to Bariloche and seeing the city on bikes was the perfect way to spend the afternoon. Kaylee gave us the usual pre-ride info and we set out (just the 4 of us... wife 12 yr old daughter and 14 yr old son). We spent about 4 hours and I felt like we got a very good intro to the city from La Boca to Puerto Madero to Plaza de Mayo. Our stop in Boca to take Mate with Kaylee was definitely a highlight for everyone. She was awesome with the kids and was very knowledgeable about the city and little nuggets of history that you wouldn't get from a book.The whole vibe of the Biking Buenos Aires shop and staff is laid back and immediately gets you into right frame of mind to experience this beautiful and friendly city.This is the 4th city which we've toured by bike. It's a great way to see everything and get your bearings. The kids love it, especially versus the alternative of getting dragged to museum after museum. I strongly recommend Biking BA if you want to see some off-the-beaten-path sites, hear some interesting history, and have a relaxing afternoon."

He was friendly, knowledgeable and willing to share his wisdom. He was also prepared to tailor the tour to our wants and requirements, but we left it to him to lead the way and we weren't disappointed. His historical knowledge was thorough and he provided a balanced overview of past events, a lot of which is not found in the guide books. Lunch was really enjoyable and more than ample in terms of quantity. Upon reflection, the quality of the bikes and the well-chosen route, which is nicely spaced and broken up between good bouts of cycling, stopping at points of interest, in-depth commentary and sharing of experiences over mate, provided a highly enjoyable and well-rounded day. The dedication of staff didn't end there as I later received a follow-up email recommending further points of interest. A great experience and one that I would recommend to others."

We did the ultimative biketour around the most popul\u00e6r places in the City. - First The bikes (only female bikes) are very basic and a bit small compared to the tal men like my boyfreind that has to bike for 6-7 hours. When you pay 90 USD I would expect better bikes. - We also though we would have seen more of the City and more \"secret/unseen\" local places instead of having a so loong lunch break.- compared to what you can get for 180 USD in BA we think this Tour is overpriced. The day before we went to Palermo where we had an good coffee with brownie, an amazing dinner at one of the Best/finest steakhouse Don Julio and a very professionel intime jazzkoncert with a bottle of Wine at Thelonious club for the same amout of money. I know it is two complete different activites, but if we should have done it agian we would have rent the bikes for a day for 250 pesos and biked by our self and have done a free walking guided Tour an other day. Tour has been the most expensive we have done the last 7 month in South America. But we are also travelling on a backpacker budget, and we are used to bike a lot also in Big Citys.Positive thing:- the guides are super very very sweet and give a amazing service!

Our tour lasted eight hours on a beautiful Saturday in March 2016, covering 17 miles but let me preface that by saying it was an easy 17 miles of flat biking. The hosts we're extremely friendly and knowledgeable in the history of the city and in ensuring our safety and happiness. I have traveled in many many countries throughout the world and I always look for the best comprehensive tour available that also is physically active and this group does a great job at combining education, fun activity and customer satisfaction"

Our guide for the day, Henrik, is as knowledgeable as he is passionate about the city and will make sure to tell you everything you need to know about the sights and the turbulent history of Argentina. The tour takes you by historic landmarks and through various neighbourhoods in a leisurely pace. There are plenty of stops on the way and the seven hours fly before you know it. The tour included a rundown of the proper way to drink the Argentinian national drink, mate, and one of the best pork sandwiches in town for lunch! We covered so many things in a day and it was a great opportunity to get a feel for the place. As a curious side note, Henrik is the driving force in promoting an active bicycle culture similar to those in Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Make sure to ask him about this if you want to know more about how bikes can help improving the quality of life in a city."

Taylor was very knowledgeable. we asked a lot of questions and he was able to provide a wide variety of information concerning history, architecture, economics and more. Lunch was a leisurely break at a street cart. In many places there were bike lanes in the street to provide a safer place to ride. even on some of the older narrower streets. Our tour was on a Sunday when the traffic was less than weekdays. I know that this tour would keep you safe but the Sunday was especially nice so if there is flexibility in scheduling think about it. The bikes that we used were in good condition and we were provided helmets and water. Taylor carried a repair kit which came in handy as we did have one flat tire. Highly recommend this group while you are in BA. Don't forget your sunscreen"

The tour is about 11 miles and was mainly flat. I had not rode a bike since I was little and I found it very easy to ride. It was a unique way to see the city and you cover a lot of ground. The parks and plazas you visit are STUNNING- so incredible. The biggest landmark you see is Recoleta Cemetery which is also something to see. We stopped for lunch and had empanadas which were also fantastic. This is a MUST DO when go to Buenos Aires!"

This is a belated review since we did the tour early January but since it's the best one we've done in throughout our South American vacation it deserves to be written. My partner and I went for the full day bike tour in BA. The group consisted of 8 people +2 guides. The tour started with a brief presentation of the tour, the participants and safety and ended with a chat after the tour. Both my partner and I felt very happy with the Biking BA tour both after the tour but even more so after having done other tours in other countries. The guide, Luke, was very knowledgeable and, more importantly, could explain complicated issues, like argentine democracy and politics, in a way that's easy to follow and interesting. He also made sure everybody's questions was answered and those he couldn't answer on the spot he promised to find out the answer and come back in an email, which he also did. The second guide was in charge of stopping traffic when necessary and making sure nobody was left behind, and he did a great job. We felt safe throughout the tour. We liked the fact that it was a fairly small group which made it easier and smoother for everybody. We can definitely recommend this Biking BA for anybody, both young and old. It's a great way of experiencing a big city like BA"

We were the only two riders and covered a lot of the city. The ride was easy, mostly flat and much of it was on bike paths. Lots of time was allowed to walk in Recolleta cemetery and the park. Highly recommended as a way to see a lot of the city."

In 2010 I had already participated in one of their first tours with William and Rodrigo of Biking Buenos Aires and the day still remained as one of the best things we did during our stay back then. So recently, when I was in BA, I did the \u201eHeart of the City\u201c tour with Rodrigo again and the tour could not have been more organized, informative and fun! I was thrilled to see how professionalism and the variety of bicycle tours have increased over the past six years. If you go on a tour, you will certainly get carried away by the enthusiasm they share about Buenos Aires and you will learn and understand a lot about the city's history plus that riding a bike in BA is a great experience. I hope to be back for another bicycle tour in the near future. :-) Couldn\u2019t recommend more highly!!!"

            "review": "BEST way to explore BA!!. My friend and I signed up for the \"Heart of the City\" tour (with Ray ray, very funny and wry guide) because we are interested in history, and the tour did not disappoint. For about $60 USD, we had a 4 hour tour (turned into 5-6 hours) on beach cruisers (5-10 minutes of light biking, then 10 minutes to stop and learn from the guide), and this included helmets and water bottles. The bikes have a basket on the front but they cautioned against simply placing valuables/phones in there, since we stopped frequently and someone could just reach in and steal it. Some other people on our tour had small backpackets and either wore them or kept them in the basket. We were also able to keep things at the store itself. The tour also included a delicious lunch of bondiolas (essentially, pork sandwiches with lots of toppings; they asked if anyone was vegetarian and made accommodations!) and an alfajor at the end. The guides were happy to stop so we could take pictures and even took a few of us off the tour for a few minutes so we could find an ATM. No need to be a \" real biker.\" Anyone from seniors to young teens could easily keep pace with the group - and there was always a tour guide in the back to make sure no one fell behind. Some of the roads didn't have bike lanes so we were rather close to cars and buses but it never felt dangerous.In fact we loved the tour so much that after it ended, we signed up for another one the next morning, Parks & Plazas (with Rodrigo, also amazing tour guide)! Coincidentally, no one else showed up for the tour, so we essentially got a private 6 hour tour of Palermo and Recoleta. This tour also included lunch of empanadas and alfajores at the end. We had to stop and respond to some work emails after lunch and Rodrigo was very nice and patient while we did that. He knows SO much about the history and culture of BA and Argentina, not to mention can recite literature from memory, and it was fascinating hearing his perspectives!"

It is well organized with email payment and messaging. Reminder was sent regarding where to meet and what to bring (hat, sunscreen, water; although they provide helmets and water and even have bottles of sunscreen for you to use on premises and throughout the tour it's offered). I did the North/South full day tour from 10-5. I was one of three making it very pleasant. Santiago was our guide and his enthusiasm for the City was evident. He explained where we would be going and pointed it out on a map. We were given a bike and offered a helmet (although I preferred my hat). Bike seats were adjusted as needed. Each bike had a basket in front and I could also attached my GoPro bike grip to the handle bar. The seats are comfortable and the bike is three speed with hand brakes. The pacing of the trip was good although I wish we could've stopped more often to take pictures (but that's more my fault for not saying something as Santiago said we could stop whenever we wanted). There are several stops where you can wander around like in La Boca, Recoletta and Plaza de Mayo. We had lunch included (delicious pork, egg, ham sandwich; vegetarian option and vegan/Celiac available). All in all, it was a great way to be introduced to the major spots in BA as it's not a very walkable city (too geographically large) and although the subway is cheap, with biking you see lots of buildings and places you'd miss underground. There are designated bike paths most of the way making it safe to ride. I'd recommend you check out Biking Buenos Aires website for the various tours they offer. It was worth the money I spent."

I really appreciated all the info he presented to us from an insiders perspective. We talked history, politics, art and culture. It was a great beginning to our Argentina vacation and gave us a good understanding of the layout of the city. Buenos Aires is a bike friendly city with a lot of dedicated bike lanes.The only drawback was that one of our people was 6'5. The selection of bikes to choose from was limited because another large tour had just left. Our tall companion had to settle for a less than optimum bike.The staff was really great and I highly recommend this tour."

The tour provides a really great opportunity to get an overview of the city, hit all the main tour spots, get to know some locals and have a lunch you wouldn't never have on your own. My partner and I were chatting at the end of the day and he asked me what my highlight was and without hesitation I answered the guide. He maintained an incredible, level of energy throughout the tour and really provided a great insight into what life is like in BA. We did this on our first day and felt that we saw the same amount in one day as we would have in 5 day if we were left to use public transport or walk. We also had a really fun lunch at a place where you would only visit as a local.The tour well above any other tour I have ever been on to make it as safe as possible. One of the guides constantly rode at the back of the group and then rode up beside us at every cross street to make sure no cars even came close to the bike lane. (Well above the call of duty). This day was incredibly enjoyable and a huge thanks to Santiago who led the tour!"

Our group was small and it was easy to keep together and Ray Ray was always looking around him checking we were still following and keeping an eye on surrounding traffic. There's a little cycling on the roads, but most of it is on cycle paths. You gain a whole new perspective on the city, see some wonderful places as well as hearing about the history. It was liberating to cycle through the city, taking in the changing landscape, from old cobbled streets, parks and plazas through to skyscrapers and an ecological reserve - the city offers such variety. A highlight was enjoying matte and biscuits overlooking the comings and goings of La Boca - or maybe the best sandwich I have ever eaten - bondiola from a wonderful street vendor. Seriously if you're in BA - do this tour. You will love it!"

Asked the hotel where I stayed and some coworkers about a tour I could do, and everyone said take a hop-on-hop-off tour.. I was about to book a hop on hop off tour, you know being a single traveller for this trip to Buenos Aires.. thank goodness i didnt.. The full-day Buenos Aires Biking tour was by far the best i have ever had.. experiencing Buenos Aires on a bike was amazing.. To add to that Ray and Gol were superb.. they made is so much fun.. Not only did I get to learn a lot about the history, culture and people of Buenos Aires, it was fun to be part of a small group rather than some of the herds I saw during the day.. Ray was very insightful, albeit a bit cheeky at times (in a good way) and Gol was around to ensure everyone had a good time.. I intend to come back in February with my wife, and go on a few other tours with Biking Buenos Aires.Anyone coming to BA, this is highly highly recommended! Thank you guys!"

Really good introduction to the city, and we learnt a surprising amount of the varied history of the city along the way Our guide, Rodriguez, was super informative and spoke perfect English. The Cemetery is on the tour, and it's definitely worth seeing. (Although it was very quiet on the roads (NY holiday period) we were very grateful for the support person who rode on ahead to stop traffic on many of the cross streets. It made a big difference to peace of mind in the face of taxi drivers that are without equal in any city we have been in (!). The tour would have been a different experience without that, particularly on normal traffic days.)"

I'm telling you, if you have an option of choosing your tour guide, this is the man.

It's not a hard bike ride so don't let the 16 miles or the 7 hours till you into thinking it's super intense. You ride for a little, you walk around for a little, you have lunch, and ride some more. We have Luke & Gol as our guides and they were awesome. Very informative and both had a great sense of humor. They provide water, ponchos if necessary, sunscreen and even Gol carried granola in case you were hungry! I would suggest bringing a protein bar just in case. When you arrive to the Biking BA office they will offer you filtered water, banana or an apple, whatever you want! Helmets are optional and the bikes also have baskets so if you bring a backpack or purse you can leave it in your basket. The ride was wonderful and Luke was very informative. Lunch was great right by the water next to the Ecological Reserve. They also offer both vegetarian and regular sandwich options! My husband and I had a really lovely time and recommend it highly!"

My other half wasn't that keen but I basically begged/cajoled him into doing it and afterwards he said how brilliant it was and that he was really glad we'd done it as it was a fantastic way to see most of the city and learn the history. We covered 26km in just over 7h (BA is pretty flat, the largest 'hill' is 30m!) on excellent bikes with comfy saddles. Top tip: the white ones have gears! They also give you a water bottle and lunch is included.We had a nice small group of 7 plus Rodrigo, our BA born and bred encyclopaedically knowledgeable guide, and Timo our mechanic/traffic stopper. All the main bits of BA are visited and we learnt lots of history of Argentina also, which was so interesting but some of it absolutely dreadful. We started at their office in San Telmo, and headed down to La Boca (bombonera stadium - interesting even if don't care about football, the social history is good) - and la caminita, where we had around free time to wander and take photos. Then it was up to Puerto Madero, the modern 'port' area, and along the Rio da Plata and the nature reserve. We stopped here and had a great lunch included - huge pork Parilla sandwich. This refuelled us and kept us going through Retiro and on to Recoleta where we learnt the history of Peron and Eva. Here we also had free time to wander in the cemetery for about 15mins. There are no signs to show you where to go (probably as they'd rather you paid for a tour) but we managed to find her tomb. After an initiation the ritual of mat\u00e9, we rolled down the rush-hour streets, between buses and parked cars (funnot scary) and on to Plaza de Mayo, our last stop before we headed back to the office for alfajores.We all said what a brilliant day it had been, and we really really recommend it to anyone coming to BA. 10am-5pm sounds long but it goes quickly it's so interesting."

Bikes are large, comfortable cruisers with baskets and water bottle provided. Our guides Sanitago and Gustavo were friendly, informative and clearly passionate about the fascinating Argentine political and cultural history \u2013 positive and not - explored on the tour. They also did a nice job of paying attention to each of us: due to a rain storm the day before, our group was on the larger side (9 riders, 5 of whom had rescheduled from the previous day) - smaller would have felt a little easier at a few intersections and road crossings, but at all times, Santiago and Gus were looking out for us and making adjustments to ensure our safety and allow us to see / spend time at all of the ride highlights. Riding on the street never felt unsafe \u2013 Argentine drivers were always paying attention to us. The key to safe bike riding in any city is riding with confidence and not wobbling and weaving \u2013 in our experience, if you do this and trust your guides, you\u2019ll be fine \u2013 and you\u2019ll have a great tour of the city. Please note \u2013 this is definitely a tour that\u2019s on bikes, not a bike ride \u2013 even though it\u2019s 26 km, the pace is slow \u2013 you won\u2019t feel that you got a workout when you\u2019re done.

It was one of the best biking tours that I have been on - the bikes were comfortable and in good shape (you can even sponsor one with your name on it if you'd like), the pace comfortable and the sites were very interesting. Ray did a fantastic job describing the important historical and political developments of Buenos Aires over the last 150 years and was keen to answer all questions. Gol was a great guide too and handy with the tools when anyone needed a minor bike adjustment. The trip comes with lunch and while they suggest that you have a hearty breakfast, I would suggest something a little lighter as they provide one of the best (and largest) grilled sandwiches I've ever had. They even finish the day with chocolates! They kept us safe and made it very fun. Two thumbs up for this tour! Highly recommend."

The primary reason is that the team behind the operation and especially Santiago and Maria (I think that's the name of the kind Brazilian girl) are really enjoying what they do and this manifests everywhere.. They are excellent on what they do and you get that kind of top notch level of experience. Moreover, Santiago who is a local is very knowledgeable of the historical, social and political context of the actual situation and communicates it in such a relevant and clear way that you suddenly immerse into it and everything makes sense! Great job !"

Situated in San Telmo the tour begins with a greeting by the friendliest crew we've met in BA. we don't speak Spanish, but our guide Taylor does with the ease of a local. This paid off in diamonds as we felt safe, and Taylor ensured that we did not miss out on anything as we rode into all the areas that are recommended for the BA traveller. LOCAL LUNCH that was included in the price was very generous. We have to say that TAYLOR BRITT was outstanding in sharing his historical and local knowledge, it's one thing to look at a building, statue, park or avenue...it's another now knowing the history behind it. We appreciated that even though there was only 2 of us taking the full day tour (which we recommend cause you see it all) they still went out, so we felt like it was a private tour at a group tour price. The bikes were comfortable, and the route easy. Traffic was not a problem as we trusted TAYLOR to get us through. Thanks again, we highly recommend the full day tour and ask for TAYLOR if possible."

The Ultimate City tour was sold out so we joined 5 other people on the Heart of the City tour. We were very pleased with the tour, and judging from what I heard, so were others in our party. This is DEFINITELY the way to see BA! We easily and safely covered a lot of ground all the while experiencing the different sensations of the city. The tour began with a orientation session in the shop, lasted about 5 hours, interesting stops, and an awesome lunch from a food truck. The guides, Ray and Santi were excellent providing interesting information and perspectives on the history, culture, and life styles of Buenos Aires. BTW, this is a easy and safe tour; BA has fairly extensive bike lanes and the automobile drivers are tolerant of bike riders and the guides are very attentive to your safety and comfort. In my opinion, the best approach would be to book a couple of their tours to learn the city quickly, and follow-up on your own with the things that really catch your interests. Bottom line: this is the best way to tour the city and is a \"Must Do\" in Buenos Aires."

I had been in Buenos Aires for nearly 10 days before I took this trip and wished I would have taken it sooner.First, piloting your own bike around the city you naturally orientate yourself and become accustom to your surroundings. Secondly, the traffic can be intimidating in the city, but the guides really helped me understand how the disorder is really just a different flow. Our guide Dominick was on traffic duty and seemed to control cars with a 'thumbs up' or a 'wait just a sec' wave of his hand. In the States, such actions would often be met with road-rage, but here drivers just nod and check their phones while they waited for us to pass.  The lead guide, Rodrigo, was simply amazing. He has a zest and appreciation for his hometown that can't be taught. He just naturally loves sharing the story of BA. A fun and cheerful character, he didn't shy away from sharing the difficult and at times tragic parts of Argentine history. Brutal dictatorships and wars are not easy to hear but absolutely necessary in understanding the culture and mood of this complex country. There was not a question I had that he did not seem to be an expert on and never rushed through an answer. My advice for your visit is to get off the impersonal bus tours and get out on a bike as soon as you can."

There were 3 of us in the tour and the tour guide Corine. Corine was from Belgium but her knowledge of the city and local history was amazing. She was very careful about safety and made sure to give us good directions about traffic and which side of the road to bike on. The bikes were in good condition and very comfortable. The pace of the tour was good, she kept asking us whether we were comfortable with the pace. I would highly recommend her as a guide if she is still in Buenos Aires. I really enjoyed the places that we visited such as Boca, San Telmo, Retiro, Palermo, Recoleta, Puerto Madero, Centro, etc. We pretty much saw a slice of the entire city in one day.

Other biking touroperators were either closed or full. The very nice english speaking woman on the phone was very excited to have us. On arrival we were greeted warmly and got introduced to Santiago our guide. Although I wouldnt mind her being our guide ughm ;-) But Santiago is the best! Speaks perfect english and told us all these background stories about the sights and history of BA and argentina. We really got the inside information that made us understand argentinian culture and society a little bit more. We did the ultimate city tour with amazing lunch and got to see all the hotspots. Thanks guys for an amazing day and keep up the good work."

Our guide Rodrigo was so knowledgable (I believe he said he had a politics degree) and interesting. He knew everything about the history, politics and economy of BA and communicated it all superbly. The cycling itself was pretty relaxed and not nearly as nerve wracking as I had anticipated. Even the place they brought us to for lunch was delicious, as were the mate and snacks provided along the way. Absolutely worth the money and a fantastic introduction to the city. Also it was my birthday and they gave me a delicious Alfajore birthday cake to celebrate-such a nice touch! Thanks Rodrigo :)"

We only had one day to spend in Buenos Aires and chose to do this as a unique way to tour the city. Because of using bikes, we got to see so much more than if going on a walking tour. There are bike lanes that were mostly used and it is completely safe. You have to have some basic ability to ride a bike, but nothing more than that. The tour included a break that included sampling mate that the tour guide made, and a lunch with empa\u00f1adas towards the end of the tour. They were delicious! Our tour guide was Estefania and she was very knowledgeable about the city. We learned a lot about its history and she had a lot of personal connection to the city as well.

I was very lucky to be with him on a private tour. His was a highly intelligent and intellectual way of explaining the architecture along the itinerary. Not just from a design point of view, obviously, but from ones that are cultural, social, political, economic, philosophical and even mythical ... etc. In other words, from just about every angle imaginable. Will has a way with words and is very articulate, speaking in BBC English, the most elegant of accents. He expresses his ideas in a way very few people can. He is able to contextualize and put things in perspective. The entire four hours were like a constant flow of information which, together with all the amazing pictures I took, could be enough to publish a book with."

For me, this is a great combination of 1) seeing parts of the city you don't usually see on a walking tour, 2) getting the inside scoop on the history and architecture and 3) eating local food from local places you might never know to visit.I went on the Ultimate city tour which was 7 hours long but not so bad considering that the city is very flat and very few uphill spots. I was relieved to see that all the bikes have nice \"fat\" padded seats - a must-have for an all day ride if you still want to be able to walk the next day. The folks at Biking Buenos Aires were incredibly friendly and helpful - I arrived early and was pleasantly surprised that there was only one other rider and the guide going with me. We all wore very stylish bike hats which were provided along with water for the journey.Santiago our guide was a mine of information on all aspects of Buenos Aires being a native of the city and very familiar with the more unpleasant aspects of its political history. We had plenty of breaks en route - the trip went from La Boca and the roots of tango and football, up to the Ecological Reserve (shame about the beach area which is really where the buildings from the middle of the city were dumped when they redesigned it as the Paris of the southern hemisphere) and then we had lunch at a parilla (grill) van - obviously frequented by the local office workers. After lunch we went through the very impressive Puerto Madera to Recoleta and a few minutes to visit the tomb of Eva Duarte (Peron) and to sample the delights of yerba mate - it felt a bit like passing a peace pipe from person to person :). The return journey was through Retiro down to the Casa Rosada or Pink House and back to the start.I really enjoyed the day and learned a lot about Buenos Aires history and its people. A big thank you to Santiago for being an excellent guide and making for a fun stay in the city."

Our guide Rodrigo was passionate about the history of his country and took time to explain the cultural significance behind the sites visited: we learnt a lot about the history and culture of Argentina. He took us for a sandwich at a cool food truck, which we really enjoyed. Follow up was fabulous - route map and local recommendations were promptly and freely provided. Bueno Aires is a very flat city so this was not a challenging ride and the tour can be done comfortably by most. I was surprised that Bueno Aires had quite a lot of bike lanes which made the ride quite comfortable (it was mostly on the bike lanes). Would recommend this young and energetic company to those visiting Bueno Aires!"

When traveling to a new city, it is always important to get the lay of the land and some history. This bike tour most certainly gave us that. Our guide (Ray) was fantastic, knowledgable, and funny. We did the Heart of the City tour which took us through La Boca, Puerto Madero, to the Pink House and more. Through all of the areas, Ray gave us a lot of the history of Buenos Aires (including that of the immigrants, disappearances, Yellow Fever, and the devaluation of the currency). We also got to experience the Mate drinking ritual and had a nice lunch (it is from a food stand outside so don't expect any warmth if it is winter)."

Our bikes were comfortable, hand a handy basket for storage and we also had cute helmets. Our guides Anne and Angeles were terrific! There were only 6 of us on our trip and we always felt safe riding through the busy streets. Angeles and Anne always had their eyes on us making sure we were safe. The tour was well-organized and informative. Our lunch was AMAZING! We had a chance to explore some areas on foot such as Boca and Recoleta Cemetery which were places we wanted to visit. Biking around the nature reserve and learning about the history of the city planning was really interesting. I would recommend this tour to anyone visiting BA. We also really enjoyed being able to ask our guides about the culture and history of BA. Angeles immediately sent us an email with helpful links to other activities. Overall, this was a great experience that was organized and professional!! Bravo Biking BA!! Do it!"

We did the Ultimate City Tour with Will. He was a fabulous guide with great knowledge of the city, history, culture, and people. A little tangental at times, but he made up for it with the yerba mate and an amazing lunch. :-) My husband and I are fairly experienced cyclists, but I was very wary about riding in the city with so much traffic. We took the tour on a Sunday, so definitely had much less traffic. Buenos Aires has been adding more protected bike lanes, and a lot of the tour utilized the bike lanes. Will did a great job of explaining each portion of our route so we would be aware of turns and lane changes, and then did a great job keeping the group together. They provided a lovely cruiser bike (I rode Leklider!), helmet, and water bottle. There is a basket on the front for a bag. We brought some granola bars, and I was glad we did because lunch wasn't until about 1pm. The tour is history and culture heavy, and it was all fascinating. I think the tour is a great way to see parts of the city that I might not have visited on my own (Caminato and La Boca, for example) but also took us to parts that I wanted to see that were further away (Recoleta, Palermo areas). We had a chance to walk around San Telmo and Recoleta cemetary. Lunch was street food by the ecological preserve and very good. The only thing that would make the tour better would be an ice cream stop!!! Riding was very easy as the city is quite flat. Thanks for a great tour, Will! Highly recommend this to anyone staying in the city. It definitely beats the hop on/off tours!"

We'd been here for 3 weeks before we went on the Ultimate City tour with Biking Buenos Aires, and now wish we'd done it as soon as we got here! We finally feel like we know Buenos Aires! In contrast, someone else in our tour was only in Argentina for the day. I feel like no matter how long you're here, a bike tour would be the perfect thing for you.Our tour was fun, engaging, and informative! We learned so much about the culture and history of Buenos Aires and its people and feel like we got to see so many of the sights we'd hate to leave Buenos Aires without visiting. While I was tired at the end of the 7 hour tour, it was certainly doable, as we stopped often.Our tour guide Ray was so funny, knowledgeable, and easy to be around. We'd highly recommend him. Ray made sure we were comfortable and happy all day and we were provided with helmets, water, and a fantastic local lunch out.This tour was the best experience we've had since coming to Argentina.

Seeing this incredible city by bike is far more intimate than a bus tour and yet lets you cover far more in a day than just a walk. Above all, it is a lot of fun.I started off with the \u201cHeart of the City Tour\u201d (South City) where Ray (Raymond) guided me through the rich history of San Telmo and Puerto Madero. We stopped to soak in the Street Tango in San Telmo, I picked up some street art and we drank Mate. It was good to open up the bike in the Ecological Reservation before a great and rather large lunch.I enjoyed the \u201cHeart of the City Tour\u201d so much that I signed up for the \u201cParks and Plazas Tour\u201d (North City) later in the week guided by Stef (Estefan\u00eda). It was another great day out, seeing a very different side of the city. Starting off at the botanical gardens, and as the name suggests we rode through various parks and plazas. We saw the cementerio recolet, stopped to eat empanadas at lunch and passed several art galleries and museums. - I wandered back the next day to check them out in more detail.A really well run company - I thoroughly recommend it."

The bike tour was a fantastic was to do that. I have never been able to see so much of Buenos Aires in a single day. Some of the many destinations that we visited included San Telmo, La Boca, Puerto Madero, Plaza de Mayo, and more. Our tour was 6 hours, but they have various options for tours of different lengths. From experiencing Argentine traditions like drinking \"mate\" and eating \"facturas\" to learning about the interesting history of the city, a tour with Biking Buenos Aires is the way to go! Angeles (aka Angie), our Biking Buenos Aires tour guide, gave us an excellent tour and explained a lot of the history regarding each of the places we visited. She was extremely knowledgeable and spoke English very well. This experience is highly recommended for anyone visiting Buenos Aires!"

I took the Ultimate tour, which is so much fun and is a visual feast with so much diversity. The guide was RayRay, who is an awesome guy. Very knowledgeable, informative. Kind, gallant and attentive. The group consisted of 5 tourists plus RayRay plus another really cool guide who joined us to watch over the U.S. From the back of the file, assist in case of technical needs ... And whip up a Yerba ceremony. I think this tour company is awesome I felt very safe & in good hands. I learned a lot & feel like I discovered it with locals. They gave us many tips & recommendations that were priceless. I'm actually going to ride with them again this weekend."

Some interesting information about Buenos AIres provided as well. Good bikes, water bottles (and water) and helmets provided. Very friendly guides. Professional operation. Safe. Lunch is included with the \"Ultimate\" which is a 7 hour tour. Starts at 10 AM - you are asked to arrive 10 minutes earlier. You need to head to San Telmo Barrio (this is if you are doing the 7 HOUR tour). Be sure to check with them so you go to the right place. They have TWO locations depending on the tour you choose.. If you are using the Subte (Metro Train System), take the \"C\" line to the Independencia station. Once you arrive at the station, if you come out of the station at the first exit (set of stairs) then you should come out to a big playground area. Congratulations, you are on the correct side of the street. Estados Unidos Street is at one edge of the park. Walk down that street towards Peru Street (it's about 5 blocks), turn right and look for the bike place on the left (2 or 3 blocks). Can't miss it - you will see the bikes outside. Tall beautiful building.If you come out of the train station and there is a big gas station in front of you then you need to cross that wide avenue you are standing next to and you will end up at the playground which is all the way over on the other side of the avenue. Follow above instructions from there.You can buy single trip tickets for the train in any station. Very easy to use. Allow plenty of time for commuting depending upon where you are coming from. Cost today is 2.5 pesos per ticket.Bring a light sweater - you may want it in the shade. Bring sunglasses, sun block. If you think 7 hours is too long on the bikes - don't. It really isn't that bad. Have fun and you will learn and see some good stuff. You will get breaks. Bathroom breaks as well. 99% of the terrain is on flat surface.PLEASE, IF YOU FOUND THIS REVIEW HELPFUL THEN CLICK ON THE BUTTON BELOW: \"Did you find this review helpful?\" I TRY TO PROVIDE AS MUCH DETAILED INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE AND I JUST LIKE TO KNOW IF I AM HELPING PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY.

Our tour guide, Santi, was cheerful, friendly and incredibly informative. He did a great job of giving us enough information and connecting the dots of Argentine history. I could have listened to him all day. Fascinating. Our second guide, Timothy, helped keep us safe by blocking oncoming traffic when necessary. While I can ride a bike on a paved trail, I am nervous about riding a bike in even neighborhood traffic. Thanks to the able leading of Santi and protection of Timothy and bike lanes, I felt completely capable of riding in BA city traffic and enjoyed myself greatly. We did the tour on a Saturday which also reduced the amount of traffic we had to contend with. I would recommend this tour to anyone who can ride a bike and I would also recommend doing the tour near the beginning of your trip to BA as it gives a nice overview of the city and provides a lot of historical context for what you will see. They also introduced us to some Argentine customs like drinking mate."

We were two fifty something moms and my 20 year old daughter who was two months into study abroad. Even with her school experience, my daughter loved the bike tour both as a better orientation for the neighborhoods and the additional history and cultural info! We were a group of 6 and we had two guides who carefully navigated us through tight intersections without a worry. I got a flat tire and Annie quickly changed out the tube and leader Ray provided great in depth stories about each district and historical background. We loved the park side cafe parilla mi sue\u00f1o where we ate the bondiola for lunch. That discovery alone was worthwhile!! We think just about everyone will love this tour."

First of all the good things: Very nice and friendly guides, taking care of everything from sending an email reminder one day before including personal tips about what else to do in BA, the tour itself with pleanty of historical information about the city and how things developed that way. They make the tour a safe drive, are organized to handle smaller and bigger problems with the bikes, provide water (and food on the one-day tour) and let you feel that they are passionate about the city, even as they are immigrants from English speaking countries (group tours are provided in English only).The only drawback: On the full-day tour you will spend a lot of time in the ecological area outside of puerto madero, which is on one side a very nice area, but prevents you from visiting other important areas of BA. So don't expect to see BA \"in one day\" on that tour - there's much more to see in BA. I also did the Graffiti Tour on Sunday - just excellent. Both tours are highly recommended and worth their money, although not cheap."

Even after a week exploring on my own I hadn't covered all the territory or gained the insights form the tour. I think it's great for an intro to the city (or even at the end of the trip) or for those who have limited time or you cover so much. The guides are so friendly and helpful and will go out of their way to answer any question you have - if they can't answer they will email you after. Some tips for those considering it (1) pay in cash in Pesos as it's cheaper than USD (2) chose the half day tour as opposed to the full day - we chose the full day as we wanted to cover La Boca as well as Ricoletta. We could have done with more time in both locations but in Ricoletta they really jus dropped us at the cemetery and gAve us 10 mins. Not rally worth the extra 3 hours and 30USD from the tour. With the money you save you can grab a cab directly to the location and probably pay for a guided tour."

Experienced road cyclists, we decided that we could tolerate sitting in the saddle over the course of seven hours as we weaved our way through some of the more colorful neighborhoods in the city. They provide water and a helmut; you provide comfortable riding gear and a desire to have an adventure. Ray-Ray is a native from New Zealand but clearly is comfortable in his new home in BA. A master of many trades, including acting, he brings a certain flair to sharing historical facts and interesting tidbits about his adopted hometown. A word of caution. While the company provides at least two guides with every trip (we were a group of 7), you should think twice about signing up if you haven't been on a bike in a long time or aren't comfortable with urban biking. You will be sharing the road with cars and buses although much of the route is in bike lanes."

I have never been fond of biking around traffic in a large city and with some hesitation went with the group idea. I contacted Biking Buenos Aires about 24 hours before we wanted the tour. Given time constraints, none of the tours offered matched our needs. Biking BA showed incredible flexibility and speed to come up with a plan for a bike tour that matched our needs. The tour was ready on-time. Though a last minute and large group, the bikes were in top shape. Our guide Angeles was very knowledgeable and friendly; her English was really good too. Her supporting guides kept us safe at every moment but, just as importantly, made me FEEL safe at every moment, even the one or two crossings of large intersections. Unbeknownst to me, Buenos Aires has an extensive set of bike lanes in the areas the tour explores (I would say about 75% of the tour was on these lanes). So, my apprehension of city bike tours was dispelled quickly with this tour. The staff at their offices was extremely helpful, responded in timely manner to my questions, and was clearly customer-focused. I highly recommend this biking tour company!"

The bikes are city type bikes conmfortable enough. The maps of the tour is nicely prepared to have a smooth ride without a lot of climbs. The stops are frequent enough and you will find a lot o interesting things from the guide, regarding the sights you visit. One of the bikes had a minor problem, that was taken cared of along the way by one of the guides. THere are 2 guides, 1 does the talking and leading the way, the other is the rear guard and stops and assures the safe passing at crossroads, also deals with any technical problems.Lunch is included in the price, in the form of huge sandwich at the best Parrilla kiosk in Puerto Madero, and a drink.I would recommended this agency to anyone.

It was exactly as described in the website write-up and both of our guides; Rodrigo and Shawn were very passionate about the history of BA and Argentina. I enjoyed it but didn't realized there would be such extensive explanations about the culture and history vs. biking. I would say that we biked for 2 1/2 hours, had a great lunch for 45 minutes and the rest was (about 2 hours) explanations; which were interesting but I just couldn't process all the information and was eager to move on and see more sights. I especially enjoyed about 35 minutes biking in the beautiful reserve. One interesting story about the \"tango bridge\" was about 20 minutes long in the hot sun and I simply couldn't concentrate. If you don't know any of Argentina's history this is a perfect starter tour or if you concerned about too much biking; don't be, there is really not a lot of biking. I agree with the positive comments on TA about the organization but just feel I would have enjoyed less talk and more biking."

Our guide was exceptional - she was friendly, informative and a complete pleasure to spend the day with. We did the parks tour in the North part of the city and felt very safe, riding in separated bike lanes for the great majority of the tour. Estefania gave us an overview of the bikes before we left and we were provided with helmets and water bottles. We had a technical difficulty with the bike's kickstand, but Estefania was ready with her tools and a smile and fixed everything up while we visited one of the stops. It really was seamless. We stopped at a restaurant and had delicious empanadas for lunch. After the trip, Estefania sent us an email with some suggestions of places to go in the city and some links related to questions we had asked during the tour.We loved this tour and felt it provided excellent value for money. This is a great way to start your trip as it provides an excellent overview of the city."

It was an awesome time with a great balance of history and an understanding of how the \"prettier\" side of Buenos Aires came to be what it is today, and honestly it would be tough to see that side of Buenos Aires on a short visit here without this tour. Robin was awesome.. great time. We're doing another tour w them tomorrow.. Definitely recommend them"

Will's tour was different. You will learn in-depth history of the country as it is intertwined with the city and stunning facts about each neighborhood. We could not throw him off with any question no matter how seemingly obscure - from the 19th century through the Argentine default. I highly recommend spending the $90 and taking a full day for the tour. You will not be bored for a minute of it and the rest of your journey in Argentina will have a great foundation."

Also, we had already visited some of the planned route (e.g. Recoleta cemetary) and Will was very flexible about changing the route so we could see something new and different. I had let them know ahead of time that our daughter needed a smaller bike (she is not quite 5 ft) and on the day of the tour she had a brand new bike-not sure if they purchased it for her, but it was apparent that they really listen to the needs of their clients.

There are 2 guides for the 10 people. One guide is focused on getting us to the places and leading the way. The second one is at the back. This was great -- I was never afraid that I would get left behind or lost (something that is typical for me on bike tours).

Essential knowledge was delivered throughout; concerning politics, tragedy, culture, more tragedy, history and war amongst more recent struggles (and even some successes!). I didn't feel overloaded with information, and when asked a few questions, the Yorkshireman answered adequately.The 6+ hours flew by, and it didn't feel like much of a work out, indeed the ~25 km roundtrip stuck to many cycle paths, and enabled us to visit some tranquil hidden nooks and crannies for a cheeky mat\u00e9/terere break.There are opportunities to dismount and stretch the legs/buy stuff/wander around. I felt safe the whole time.Do it."

It was so good that when I came back to BA this December with friends, taking the tour again was one of the first things we did.The Ultimate city tour starts at 10 and runs until around 5, and takes you through the city while providing excellent commentary, history and insight into this marvellous place. Buenos Aires is mostly flat and there are many stops to explore so there is no need to worry about your fitness level.The crew at Biking Buenos Aires are great and very willing to help make your experience in BA the best it can be. They are passionate about riding and Buenos Aires and it comes across in everything they do."

She even sent every person on our tour a document with lists of things to see, foods to eat and what to see outside of BA. Now we will have to return to take advantage of it all!The tour itself was great- we followed a southern route which gave us access to San Telmo, Boca, Puerto Madero and the heart of the city. We stopped for lunch in Puerto Madero, which was included in our package, and enjoyed delicious Lomo and pork sandwiches. Veggie options were available for vegetarians. Taylor was really helpful as our 'mechanic' and traffic stopper- so we always felt safe peddling across intersections without stoplights.All around a very recommended experience!"

At Puerto Madero, we had a lunch stop at the river promenade. Santiago really took his time to go everywhere, not stopping telling us more and more. And this is what it made really special and memorable, his enthusiasm and knowledge. He was so involved and knew so much about the history of the city and the country. We were really impressed and for us it was a really good start of our trip throughout the country. During our Argentina trip, we thought often about all the things he told us and on our way back, when we had two more days in BA, we knew what to do because of all the suggestions given by Santiago."

The guide gives a good overview of the City, its history and of some Argentinian traditions and customs - we also got to try Mate (Argentinian tea) We had a fantastic, and massive, Pork Bondiola (a pork steak sandwich) for lunch - it was simple but delicious.\u00a0Our guide Ray was very helpful with suggestions for places to visit and even thoughtfully brought alcohol hand gel and tissues for us to use before lunch. I would suggest that you do this tour as close to the start of your time in BA. It is a great way to see the City and meet new people, but don\u2019t expect the history to be anything more than a rudimentary overview - there really isn\u2019t time for much else. Those who came knowing nothing about BA found it far more informative than those of us who had already spent a month travelling in Argentina and had previously read extensively around the history of BA. Thanks Ray, we had a great time.\u00a0"

Our guide was incredibly smart and gave us perspective on current and past events of Argentinian and city history. The food truck sandwiches for lunch are so good too! Tips: I definitely recommend going on a Saturday or Sunday when traffic is reduced. It's a long (and great) day so stay hydrated and wear the sunblock they provide. Lunch is a sandwich and it's street food style; I loved loved it, but set your expectations so you can enjoy."

I can thoroughly recommend trying these guys if you can ride a bike and want to see a great city.The booking and pre-tour side of things was excellent with Estefania responding very quickly, and they even worked with Buenos Aires Local Tours (another tour company on Trip Adviser) to work out which parts of the city we could cycle in and others to walk in, etc, to avoid duplication.That was a very helpful tool as we split a day into two, ie, a walking tour and a cycle tour (4 hours each/on separate days) which was great for our kids (aged 13/7).RayRay was our tour guide, and he was excellent. He made us all feel welcome and safe and he was great with our kids too.This is definitely one to try, even if you're not an accomplished cyclist. Thanks guys!"

We took the tour \"Heart of the City\" for 5h, and got to see many interesting places at a comfortable pace. It does sound a little dangerous to go biking in Buenos Aires, but we felt quite safe and had a really good time. I highly recommend it to anyone who is familiar with a bike and does not mind a little exercise\u2026.The owners & staff of Biking Buenos Aires are very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. Thanks Robin (and the Belgian girl, I forget your name, sorry!) for the much-needed coffee and your thoughtful help&advice when we arrived in pouring rain and had to reschedule to the following day. Thanks above all to Angie, our wonderful guide! Sharing your knowledge, not only of Argentina, Buenos Aires and its history, but also of the people \u2013 and dogs!! \u2013 living there made this tour very special to us. The chocolates and yerba mate you recommended were great. Hope to be back some day, and to everyone interested in seeing Buenos Aires close up \u2013 Biking Buenos Aires is the place to go!"

I recently returned from a week-long visit to the beautiful city of Buenos Aires, and a highlight of my trip was the Ultimate City Tour with Biking Buenos Aires. This tour is a full day at around seven hours, but it's an easy ride (almost completely flat!) and should be leisurely for most people. We hit all of the \"hot spots\" in the city, from Puerto Madero to the Casa Rosada to La Boca! Our guide, RayRay, was hilarious, and he knew so much about the city's history and culture that he probably could have led a 12-hour tour without breaking a sweat. I am inspired to ride my bike through my own city now, and to seek out other bike tours when traveling to new places. I'd highly recommend both the Ultimate City Tour AND Biking Buenos Aires if you're visiting the city!"

I booked a private tour, originally for my husband and I but sadly on the morning of the tour he wasn't feeling too great so I had to go solo but it was still a lot of fun because Will my guide took great care of me and was very good company. He knew so much about Argentina and its incredible history that I felt in just a few short hours I had learnt so much. I have taken cycle tours in Montreal, Sydney and Rio and would recommend sight seeing by bicycle to everyone - in my view it is the only way to go. Bike in Buenos Aires are a very professional and caring company, you are sure to have fun and if you have Will or a tour guide like him you will learn a lot also."

Lunch was included.A number of shorter tours are available. The bikes are single speed cruiser style bikes and were well maintained. We biked on a Sunday which has less traffic but BA has good bike lanes and the guides are knowledgeable about navigating the traffic.Their office is easy to find in the San Remo district and is close to central hotels.

Everything is deeply customized and conversation oriented - so much information and amazingly at the same time you won't feel bored for even a single minute! During the bike ride I don't feel I am with a tour guide, it's more like biking with a friend ( to some extent better than a friend, because you paid so you are well taken care of all the time) .

This one was definitely not good, neither fun.Although it was a bit expensive compared to other similar activities in the city, I decided to give Biking BA a go, as it had lots of great reviews and I thought there was maybe something special about it. I was wrong. I took the Park and Plazas tour with a friend. Ourselves and the rest of the group were very quickly welcomed by our guide on the street outside the Botanical gardens and simply took off with no introduction to the tour, which was a bit awkward to start with. The ride lasted five long hours, as the tour had no dynamic at all. We made around seven stops, where we would just hop off our bikes, be offered time to take pictures and hop on again to get to the next stop. No significant information related to the city and the sights was provided at any time. Even when we stoped at Recoleta's Cementery, one of the most historical attractions of the city, the guide stayed outside and we were left on our own, with no other choice than to guess the information (I had to go back there on a walking tour the next day!).Lunch was included on the price, which it sounded fair when we hired the tour, but we were never expecting to have to sit at restaurant waiting half an hour to place an order and almost another half to receive our -average- meal. Disastrous. Worst part of the day.Trust me, I'm not too demanding as customer, but paying so much for such an unprofessional, disorganized and boring activity, I guess it would make anyone unhappy. I was expecting a fun and informative bike tour, but either than that it felt more like a hop-on-hop-off tour just to take pictures.Make some more research than me and think twice before taking this bike tour. Totally not recommended."

            "review": "Great introduction to BA!. I booked this tour last minute bc it seemed like a perfect way to introduce myself to BA, and vice versa, while avoiding the hop on hop off bus. It lived up to and probably surpassed my expectations. It was a great tour. Our main guide was Ben, and he gave great context to everything we saw. He definitely wants to shine a light on Argentina's good attributes. We also had Santi as a sweep. He was pleasant, interesting, kind, and very funny. Finally, we also had Joanna who was helping out during her last days at the office and in BA. The three of them were a fantastic team - all kind, knowledgable, and patient. The non-guides were just 3 bc 4 ppl failed to show. I would not have wanted the group to be any bigger. After reading other reviews before writing mine, I realize that maybe part of the charm of my experience was due to the intimate nature of the group. I really felt like I was riding with friends by the end of the day, and I was genuinely sad to leave in the afternoon. In terms of difficulty - this is for anyone. You only cover 26 km in 7 hrs, so it's not physically taxing bc you never ride more than a few km before reaching a point of interest. You see many of the main neighborhoods and tourist attractions that you would on a hop on hop off bus or other kinds of BA city tours. This was exactly what I was looking for. However, you have a much closer and intimate experience on bikes - both bc you are physically closer and the pace is slower, and bc the guides are fantastic and explain things in a more intimate manner (rather than someone on a mic at the front of a bus talking over a load of chatty chads). Finally, the whole operation over at Biking BA is top notch. After the ride, Santi, Ben, and another Guide went far and beyond to help me get home. Ben helped me w a Sube card, Santi found my route and was incredibly patient w my ignorance of BA geography, and the last guide actually walked me a few blocks in the direction of the stop and helped me find a kiosko to charge the card. Wow. Take away:Safe and fun way to get oriented w BAGreat group of patient and kind guidesThough $90 is expensive, I felt that my experience was worth the expense Caveat: I loved my small group. Not sure how I'd feel if it were the full 7 ppl + 3 guides."

We did the Architecture Tour with our extremely knowledgeable tour guide, Will. The bikes were thoughtfully outfitted with water bottles and gloves to prepare us for an enjoyable ride even in chilly weather. One of our favorite parts about the tour was Will, who discussed the origins of the buildings in such an enthusiastic and engaging way, throwing in intriguing political tidbits, and making history come to life for us. He also taught us how to make yerba mate, and we enjoyed the tea and cookies together as a group in a picturesque park under the sun. It was a very fun and memorable day. We highly recommend this!"

From the start the day was well organised and fun. Arriving at their airy office to a cup of tea and an array of very comfy blue bikes. The tour was relaxed but full and detailed and you followed the up and downs of Argentine history in the places where it happened. Angie was great , friendly, enthusiastic, informative, fun and patient. Plenty of time for photos and exploring. Also a great lunch in a place you would otherwise not have found! You get a great feel for the city , its orientation, history and emotions. Definitely recommend.Angie also recommended Wes for Tango lessons so we booked a lesson with him and had a great hour and a half of getting a feel for the emotion and (very tricky technicalities) of the tango, if only we could stay for a whole course of lessons.....want to learn more!

But I have to say, I'm so glad I decided to do a Biking Buenos Aires tour. I got to see all of the main parts of the city in one day and in style (the bikes are all the sky blue Argentinian color and have a retro vibe to them) I learned so much about the history of the city that I didn't know about, and I met some awesome people who I've been hanging out with since. Our tour guides Corina and Angie were absolutely fantastic (never mind the fact that they're both absolutely gorgeous!) Corina was our leader and history professor. She had this incredible way of telling stories of the past that painted such a vivid picture and really took you back. Angie was our protector and handywoman. She followed us, made sure traffic stopped for us (which is a hefty task here in BA), and got her hands dirty if anything happened with one of the bikes. Corina led and enlightened us and Angie kept us safe. Oh, and the included lunch was soooooo delicious. So grateful for this experience! Thanks to the whole team for being so awesome."

Corine and Angie were our guides and gave us a wonderful tour of the city. The cycling was very easy and there were plenty of stops to take pictures and walk around. The best part of the tour, however, was the history and background that was given to us throughout our ride. We learned all about the colonization of BA by the Spanish, and the evolution of the city over time. Past and current-day politics and societal issues were also explained in a very informative way. These were all things I had meant to read in all the guide books I had bought prior to our trip (but didn't have time to read), but they were covered in a much more interesting way.We highly recommend this trip as a great way to kick off your visit to BA."

It was just us and one other woman on the tour, plus our two guides (this was a few months ago\u2026I think one of the guides was named Steph?). Our guides were easygoing yet attentive, and knew so much about the city. We went on the Plazas and Parks tour around the Palermo region and were amazed by how many bike lanes and bike paths there were! I felt pretty safe the whole time, especially because we always had one guide in front and one in back. It was such a relaxed and fun day. We stopped for a delicious lunch and by that time, kind of felt like we were all friends! We were able to ask our guides questions about Argentine and BA culture that had been burning on our minds for days. :) Also, the bikes were great and worked perfectly. I would absolutely, highly recommend this attraction! A great time and a great value. Oh, and we met the founder of the company while we were out on our ride, and he stopped for a mate break with us. When we told him we were about to move to Colorado (where he's from) he later emailed us and got us connected with his friends in CO to help us find a place to stay, etc. Totally went the extra mile!"

The tour itself was actually surprisingly informative - the bike is a great way to get around easily between the major sites, and at each stop there was an interesting story of argentina's and buenos aires history. We do go through caminito, although if you want to take your time and stroll the tourist shops, you'll have to come another day. We stopped for about 25 minutes but that probably isn't quite enough time if you are souvenir hunting. The tour takes you through the conservation area - which is quite a nice bike ride and finishes with an amazing argentinian asado lunch...get the bondiola! My guide was even good enough to lend me some pesos since I only had large denominations."

The guide, Corina, was very passionate about the city and her English was perfect. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see the city while getting some mild exercise."

The tour was a very easy ride, the bikes were super comfortable and they even provided us with water, a scarf and some gloves. The food was amazing and the conversation even better, what better way to spend the afternoon than feasting on Argentinian food and sharing a beer.If you want to do a tour and see everything in one day then I can highly recommend this one."

Our guides were truly amazing. They were funny and very knowledgable! I was nervous about biking in an unfamiliar city, but they made us felt extremely safe! We used bike lanes for about 80% of the ride. When we didn't, the guide in the back would bike up to the front and guide traffic around us. The city is very flat which made biking all day a breeze. Bikes themselves are in excellent shape. This is such an exciting way to experience BA. A must do for everyone visiting Buenos Aires!"

The tour makes lots of stops and is mainly on bike paths. Any road riding was done so very safely. The tour covered lots of different areas: La Boca, San Telmo, Puerto Madeiro, Recoleta etc and makes an enjoyable stop for a very hearty lunch. We enjoyed this tour and would recommend it as a good way to see Buenos Aires and hear a bit about its history. You do not need to be fit to complete the ride as the pace is very easy going and the guides speak English very well (I believe Corrine speaks about 5 different languages) so you can rest assured you will have a great time."

Fortunately most of the cycling was on bike lanes and as we went on a Sunday there was far less traffic. It's also quite clever the way they do it as one guide will try and block the traffic while the other one leads the cyclists so I felt quite safe to be honest.We booked online with a promo code from their Facebook page.We did the ultimate tour and our guides were Onno and Will - who were both amazing. Onno did most of the talking and told us loads about the city, I felt like I learned lots and he had a really clear and loud voice so we could always here him above the traffic at any busy parts. Both guides were very knowledgeable about the city and answered our questions and also gave us some good recommendations at the end so it's definitely worth doing at the start of your stay in Buenos Aires if you can.Will was also the mechanic if something went wrong with the bikes. I had a problem with my bike so swapped bikes with Will so that he could cycle my first bike to the mechanic and get another one which he managed to do really quickly. It was really good that he was there! Lunch was a delicious and huge barbecued meat sandwich with loads of salad it was very tasty and filling - I didn't have to eat for the rest of the day!If you don't have a long time in the city especially, this is a really great way to learn and see lots."

The guide did not use any slowing or stopping signal and limited turning signals. Since our tour was on the Wednesday before the Easter holiday there was a lot of traffic and pedestrians so the signals would have made the tour a little easier"

As I'm a beginner biker (been on a bike less than 10 times) I was a bit nervous about doing the Ultimate City Tour but honestly by the end I wanted more and was sad it was over. Corina and Ray were great guides and kept us safe through the traffic. I recommend doing the tour on a weekend as the city clears out and you don't deal with so many cars or pedestrians. Corina was kind enough to ask how much history we wanted to learn and was very knowledgeable."

The other people in the group were also great, so it made for a nice afternoon. MY RECOMMENDATION, however... is that you take the Ultimate City Tour. We opted for the \"Heart of the City\" tour because we weren't sure if we would like it enough to be trapped on an all day thing, but if I had it to do over again, I would take the longer more extensive tour."

Overall, we enjoyed the tour as you get a fantastic view of the city from a different perspective. The only disappointing part was our main guide seemed to be in a rush throughout the tour. At one point she crossed the intersection as it was turning yellow, leaving the rest of the tour group behind (although a few tried to follow in unsafe conditions). To be fair, it is probably highly dependent on which tour guide you get. We have done bike tours in other large cities like Paris, Barcelona, Berlin, etc, and this felt the least safe. Otherwise, it was a fun tour overall."

They have a perfect tour route, great bike paths, and if you are worried about being on a bike all day---don't be. The city is pretty flat and the bikes are cruisers and there is no rush. Luke gave us a little history at each stop and lots of interesting tidbits. Lunch was fantastic street food...we could never find this place on your own!"

            "review": "Underwhelming & overcrowded bike trip. I'm usually a big fan of biking tours and love to take them in every city that I visit, but the \"Ultimate City\" tour in Buenos Aires is a bit mediocre for a number of reasons, many of which are unfortunately out of the hands of the company. Our guide Onno was absolutely excellent and very knowledgeable about the city, so no complaints there, but here are the other issues that really dampened the experience: 1) Buenos Aires has some lovely bike lanes which you spend most of your time on during the tour, but unfortunately when you're on a regular street, you have to contend with aggressive and slightly crazy Argentine car drivers who will cut you off, ignore stop signs, and swipe absurdly close to you while making turns. This made the experience a bit more dangerous than bike tours usually are. 2) Our tour had 11 people plus Onno and the sweep. This was way too many people, as our group would often get cut off at intersections, be dangerously crowded on tight turns and narrow roads, and couldn't be flexible with our stops (i.e. often I'd see something cool I wanted to ask about or take a photo of but didn't feel comfortable slowing down everyone else in our large group in order to do so). Given the price tag of $90, which is somewhat hefty for a basic bike tour, we would have preferred to be in a smaller group. 6 people max would have been ideal. Many of the issues listed above and below would have been avoided. 3) I would absolutely NOT RECOMMEND this tour for beginner bikers. There were several other riders on my tour who were not confident or not very skilled at group riding - i.e. they would abuse their brakes, wobble on their handlebars, slow down when they needed to speed up, or crowd up in narrow areas instead of biking in line. This led to several near-accidents and collisions with me and my friends, so we ended up trying to bike as close to Onno as possible to be in front of the trouble riders. Ideally on a tour, you should be enjoying yourself and not trying to avoid other riders. Unless you really love biking, I'd say save your $90 bucks for another activity in Buenos Aires and do bike tours in other cities instead."

I had been really excited about doing this and was quite disappointed that the weather played against us, but that definitely is not the company's fault. The reason I'm rating it so highly is the way that the company handled the situation. They were very professional and tried to accommodate another date. Unfortunately my travel plans weren't as flexible as they were. So what I can rate as \"excellent\" was the condition of the bikes, the introduction by the guides, the professionalism displayed by both the guides and the administration, and my deepest respect for keeping me safe. I guess they could have continued with the tour and made their money, but they felt that the weather may be putting me at risk if we continued. I respect that! I will definitely seek them out the next time I'm in BA."

Ben was an amazing guide - super professional but also really friendly and knowledgeable. He was prepared for everything, from tools to sunscreen to toilet paper (which you'll find out, is not always available at public restrooms). He's also totally willing to take pictures for you, so we got some good ones of ourselves. This tour is the only full day tour that I could find, and though it's a bit pricier than the other bike tours, it's worth every penny. And after a week in Argentina, I've found that tours run by ex-pats are FAR better in quality and service than ones run by locals. (Some of the local-run tours I booked were cancelled without notice, cut short, or had little to no concern for safety!) The bikes have baskets, so bring what you need in a small bag, and you won't have to carry anything. If you have a limited amount of time, this is an easy way to see everything and get a feel for the city and it's history. The ride was really easy - almost all of it was flat, with just one hill at Recoleta and the bridge. (You can walk your bike up if you're tired, it doesn't take very long). Thanks Ben! If I'd had more days, I might have taken one of the other tours."

With a group of about 10 clients we had a knowledgeable, pleasant and helpful guide with 2 helpers that shepherded us through any tight spots. Buenos Aires has a large number of cycle lanes through the city making it a lot easier than battling through traffic, however, even in the odd occasions where we did mingle with the traffic we never felt unsafe.The tour included lunch at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 that serves local food.

If you can arrange it for a weekend or holiday, when traffic is a lot lighter, so much the better. The price was pretty steep, but I felt we got our money's worth!"

My girlfriend and I went to BA for a weeklong vacation and had booked the full day bike tour on our first day as a way to get an overview of the entire city. We had figured that we could make mental notes on the bike tour and then spend the rest of our trip visiting those places that we really wanted to see more of. Our tour guide was Will Epps, and I don't think we could have gotten luckier. Will is in a PhD program at the local university and is studying anthropology, which couldn't be more appropriate for his insights during the bike tour. I think he was able to share a lot about the history of Buenos Aires based on his studies. Furthermore, Will, being British, was able to provide some interesting perspectives on the history of BA.I would highly recommend that you do a bike tour if nothing else while visiting BA. I can honestly say that we saw and learned the most on that first day. Also, BA is pretty flat, so I wouldn't be scared away by 7 hours of bike riding. Our group was very small, as there was only two other people with us."

The meeting point in San Telmo was a bit hard to find, though. Four people in the group that day so we had a cosy and easy ride around town.

We were a family of 5: my wife and I, and our two grown sons and daughter-in-law.

They were very entertaining and gave us a good overview. It was a long day with 26 kms of biking around BA. We started at San Telmo and biked though Boca and saw the sights. Caminito was amazing with the colors. Jonathan and ? prepared delicious matte with sweet biscuits. We also tried dulce de lecle. It was delicious. Next we biked through the nature reserve to the back of the Rio Plata River. It was a very hot day and the chain fell off the bikes multiple times. We had lunch in a road side eatery and tried fernet with coke. I enjoyed it but most others didn't like it. We pushed on and saw the giant flower installation, recoleta cemetary and biked down to Plaza de mayo. It was a long day but we saw most of the sights and Jonathan and ? were very nice and helpful. I will give 5 stars for the guides but the bikes broke down 6 times for 10 people. I think they have to maintain or upgrade the bikes. So I am giving 4 stars overall. With better bikes, this will be the best way to see Buenos Aires in a day. One suggestion I will make is to skip the nature reserve on the hot days as it is a long bike drive that adds little to see."

How wrong I was about seeing everything! This tour was FANTASTIC. Our guide, Jonathan, a local argentine with impeccable English and a quick sense of humor was an absolute legend. We were made to feel comfortable from the very beginning with introductions and light banter it set the tone for a really fun day. The tour itself is pretty comprehensive, starting in San telmo, heading down puerto madero and the biological reserve, through retiro and recoletta, our guide took us to all the hotspots and was incredibly knowledgable and friendly, in spite of there being artery difficult guest on our tour, his enthusiasm and approachability never faltered, a true professional. I saw things I hadn't seen before as well as covering ground I'd been too but it was impossible not to have a good timeI took the 7 hour bike tour and if you do I have a couple of tips. Take sun screen, even though they provide it, it's always great to have your own as when I went it was a scorcher! Lunch is provided as is water but I swear my liter bottle of apple juice saved my sugar levels! Lunch is provided and I recommend the bondiola, it was amazing!All in all one of the best tours I've ever done anywhere, thoroughly recommend these guys, you won't be disappointed!"

We picked the half-day option, killed some time by walking around the San Telmo Sunday market (highly recommend) and were soon greeted by Will himself. Although Will could have been annoyed for having to give us a tour on his Sunday, he was quite the opposite. Genuinely apologetic for causing us any inconvenience, and thrilled to share his insight on a city he has truly fallen in love with. It was also great to hear about the history of the company. The tour was great in its own right. We got several history lessons on how the city was founded, the different barrios, biked though San Telmo, Boca, and Puerto Madero. Drank Mate, ate some of the largest sandwiches ever, and met some very cool people.

I was welcomed by Kat the tour guide and introduced to the bikes and the 3 other group members, then encouraged to take them for a test ride up the street to ensure everyone was comfortable and make any adjustments to seat heights, tyre pressure etc. After a quick safety briefing and discussion on what to expect the group was off.Kat was warm, friendly, approachable and professional. She has a great knowledge of the city and its history, and guided us effortlessly through the numerous areas, streets and paths.

The tour started in San Telmo and went along most of the barrios in Buenos Aires along with the landmarks and reserves. The tour was in English so i was skeptical of the authenticity of it. However, the tour guide was a Porteno with a great command of the English knowledge. I was happy to have a Porteno as a guide, and Jonathan provided the authentic perspective of the history of the city with objectivity. He also provided humor and a family atmosphere for us, without sacrificing the seriousness that came with many of the historical topics covered. He also was conscience of any cultural differences that might cause awkwardness during the tour (sharing mate for example) and made sure we were comfortable. My only issue was that we didn't really ride through Palermo. Otherwise the tour covered alot and is made for all riding types. As an avid cyclist i prefer more mileage, but then the tour would be exclusive. you can bring anyone along and enjoy the tour. you get to see the greenway of the city and travel through places you would never reach on foot. It's a highly recommended tour. and the lunch, from a streetcart, is as authentic experience as you will find on a tour of the city. Thanks again Biking Buenos Aires.!!"

A huge roll with a choice of beef pork or chicken (also a lovely vegetarian cheese option that my wife said was delicious), and salad and all the relishes under the sun to add to it. The highlight of the tour was the visit to Camanito so colourful and full of life. A great way to see BA and we thoroughly recommend Biking BA"

The tour lasted around 4 hours and visited several parks and plazas in the northern part of the city. The guide was very friendly and happy to stop whenever clients wanted to. It was well paced and a nice way to get some physical activity, but nothing too difficult. I also enjoyed it because it made me realize what a good city for biking BA is, and I will definitely use my own bike more often now."

Kat has been a great guide: enthusiastic, always smiling and knowledgeable about a surprising number of facts, figures, histories and anecdotes. I'd definitely recommend her to any friend wishing to learn a lot about BA, and to see many different places in just few hours. We took the full city tour (7 hours) and we were lucky to be the only two that day, having basically a personal tour! The presence of a good number of bike lanes makes the tour safe and enjoyable, despite BA's traffic can be hectic at times. I felt that the balance between the 25 km covered and the number of things that we were able to see and experience was quite good and couldn't have been reached with public transport or by feet, especially when we explored a huge park, the riverside, pedestrian areas, etc.Bikes were in good conditions, helmets were provided, and safety was taken into account throughout the tour."

One of the best features is when you select the tour you want, it shows you how many people are already confirmed - with the two of us, it added up to five so we knew it was going to be a nice and small group. Either way, the maximum is 10 per tour and it will not let you book once this number is reached - great touch, as we've heard of other companies that say only X number of people are allowed but they turn up and the groups are much bigger and get pretty unwieldy. We did the Heart of the City tour and ended up with Amanda, an American guide. Well, this turned out to be the best stroke of luck as she is AMAZING! So knowledgeable (honestly, I don't know how she keeps all that info in her head) and just the perfect mix of professional and casual. She's friendly, charming and positive... and not at all over the top - just an all-round great personality. She gave us a really well-informed tour of the sites, which included the Caminito in La Boca (where we got to share mate just like Argentinians and learn all the etiquette that goes with it); the crazy Bombonera stadium (we loved Amanda's description of the highly rivalrous matches and the pre-match shenanigans); the nature reserve at Puerto Madero, the Plaza de Mayo and the Presidential Palace; and - my favourite - the haunting half-built memorial to hundreds of people held, tortured and murdered in detention during the 80s. Amanda's delivery was great - no over-dramatisation or anything - just matter-of-fact, to the point and so well-informed about that part of Argentina's history. She also gave us some great tips about the city, like going to the San Telmo markets on Av Defencia and that was the best day we had in BA.The bikes are well maintained and easy to get around on. Water is supplied, as is lunch. We had an amazing (and simply HUGE) bondiola sandwich at a super local parilla out on a kind of boardwalk area. This was one of my favourite parts as well - getting to sit around with locals and eat what they were eating. The great thing about this tour is that you get to go places that you wouldn't usually (either due to time constraints or whatever). For us, that area was Puerto Madero which we had no real interest in but were very happy to see as part of the tour. If we'd had more time in BA, we would have booked another tour for sure."

Great way to see the city - although 7 hours/15 miles sounds a long way it was split into a number of short legs with stops to take photo's and have a relaxing lunch, which was included, with no real hills so tour was relatively easy. Amira was a great guide and was very knowledgeable about BA and spoke excellent English. Took in all the main areas of the city and although the stops were generally short and sharp it was a good opportunity to get an insight into BA and pin point areas/attractions to spend more time at ones leisure during remainder of our short stay. Some of the route is on main roads but as it was Sunday was generally quiet - can imagine it being a lot busier during the week. Bikes were in good condition and comfortable ride. Chance to stop and share some Mate at the cemetery with time for a very brief visit. Just enough time to find Eva Peron\u2019s family crypt and take some photo's and as it was later in the tour/afternoon was reasonably quiet. We returned the following day and couldn't get near due to the cruise ship tours - would have had about an hours wait to take a photo. Great day out albeit a little tiring - was fortunate that tour started/finished close to the Sunday Market on Defensa - so that rounded off the day nicely"

He always watched for us and made sure we got across streets and that cars stopped to let us all pass. Jo was very knowledgeable about the history, culture and politics of Buenos Aires and we all enjoyed listening to him. His English was impeccable.

Besides an excellent tour with interesting commentary, there was an introduction to mate, the local tea drink, a stop for the local bondiola, a classic BA sandwich and of course the ubiquitous alfajores! Really wonderful day."

We never imagined we could have so much fun in a bike tour and we also never imagined BsAs is so ready for that..We strongly recommend this tour"

We got to see pretty much all the highlights of this massive city. Joho and Em were our guides for the day and the knowledge they had about the city was great. Also, they were really careful and paid lot of attention to make sure we are safe in this high traffic city. Great local lunch and had a reasonable time to explore different places by ourselves. Also, it wasn't cycling for long continuos duration, joho and Em managed to break the tour to give us a relaxing time and also enough time to soak the BA atmosphere. We strongly recommend and good value for money!Valerie (Switzerland) & Jay ( Melbourne- Australia)."

I knew Buenos Aires was a big city with lots of different neighborhoods so I signed my boyfriend and I up for a 7 hour bike tour on our first full day there. It was AWESOME! Super fun and got to see so many different parts of the city including La Boca(Caminito, La Boca Stadium), Puerto Madero, Recoleta Cemetery, San NIcholas, Playa Mayo, San Telmo. So much all in one day and then we got to spend the rest of our trip going back to the places that interested us the most. Got a great feel for the city and it was super safe. There are bike lanes in most places that separate you with a curb from car traffic. The tour guides are also really great and super engaging. Lunch was good and for a long bike ride it was surprisingly doable for someone who does not normally ride bikes long distances. If you're in average shape, this tour is just fine. A must do when you visit!!!"

It was actually more like 4 friends on a bike ride together (with one knowing a tonne about BA- LOL) 2) There was an excellent lunch included in the tour. 3) Although it was 7 hours long it was not a strenous bike ride (its so flat here in BA). 4) We had enough breaks and time to explore a bit on our own.

I wish that we had chosen to do our bike tour of the city FIRST, because this tour provides a great overview of many different neighbourhoods. To my surprise, there are many streets in Buenos Aires that have bike lanes, and when bike lanes aren't available, our guide, \"Karri\" chose routes that were logical. I would endorse this group in a heartbeat. Karri was extremely knowledgeable about the history of the city, he was accommodating when he found out that we had already seen many of the attractions that were on the planned route for the day. That is, instead of seeing things that we had already visited, he changed the route to incorporate sites we hadn't yet seen. We had questions about some of the graffiti we saw, or sites that we had seen or had been looking for, and he had answers that made sense. I was particularly happy to visit one of the memorial sites for the Disappeared. Our bicycles were great - no maintenance problems, and helmets and water were provided. I loved the lunch on the boardwalk by the Ecological Reserve, and the many very contrasting neighbourhoods and areas we visited. It was a seven hour tour, and it went by quickly. The ritualized \"sharing of Mate\" in the late afternoon was a nice perq."

Karri was also very informative with the history of places we stopped at, and allowed us free time to roam the cities and take lots of photos. My favourite was personally Boca with the colourful houses and bustling atmosphere.It was indeed a greay day out exploring the city and as we were short on time, doing the ultimate bike tour was a perfect way to see the many different cities of Buenos Aires.

They stop every 10 minutes or so and talk about the place you are in so it never gets boring or tiring despite being an all day activity. Also, some of the places you go to see might take a whole afternoon to get to and tour by yourself, and it is nice to zip over on a bike and be able to do it in no time. The guides them self were very funny and engaging and answer all sorts of questions. Definitely do this."

It was the perfect length (approx. 4 hours) and was *the* way to see San Telmo, La Boca,and Puerto Madero. Our tour guide, Brett, was knowledgeable and fun as she confidently steered us around the busy streets of BA. Really enjoyed the trip through the ecological reserve (with a stop for matte - nice touch!) and the stop for lunch at Parilla Mi Sueno was delicious and authentic We saw things we would have been unlikely to catch on our own - like the pensive stop at the Club Atletico memorial and the drive-by of the Boca Juniors' stadium. It didn't hurt that the weather was fabulous. Did this toward the end of my visit to BA and felt it was the best day of the trip and a great way to cap off a truly excellent vacation in this fun city. Don't miss Biking Buenos Aires!"

The stop for street food was also great - something we might not have tried on our own.All in all, it was a great tour and we could not have had a better guide.

Our guide for the Parks and Plazas tour was Brett, a fun and knowledgable student from the US who has clearly come to love BA and knows the history and anecdotes of the sights and city, not to mention the best places to ride. We began on the City's many bikepaths -- and within 1 minute, put all of the rhetoric about BA not being \"bike friendly\" out of our minds. We biked the many paths and roads through central BA's parks and green spaces, stopping along the way to hear about the history and personalities we had read so much about. It was a safe, leisurely ride, and families with kids would love this. Brett seemed to command a certain \"presence\" in the streets....the frenetic, harried drivers really did come to a stop for our little group, some folks even waived -- we imagine that bike tours are something fairly novel in this part of the world. We were able to stop, share some mate together, go through the beautiful rose garden, and much more. We highly recommend Biking Buenos Aires for a really fun, healthy way to see the city (and burn off some of the steak you've been eating.)

It felt more like a tour with friends rather than with tour guides. I never got the feeling that they rushed the tour or give me a poorer treatment, just because I was by myself. During breaks we even stayed a while and talked, even when I was finished taking my pictures which made for a very relaxing tour. I was able to ask them a lot of questions and they answered them all willingly. I got the feeling that they really care and are interested in the people they meet through the tours, as they even remembered a friend who had done a tour with them before and had recommended it to me. They also gave me suggestions for what to do and where to go after my tour. I can only recommend Biking Buenos Aires to anyone. Do it, if you can! Thanks a lot again, guys!"

After a rocky and disasterous start to my visit to Buenos Aires, I decided to take a chance on the Biking Buenos Aires tour which I had seen recommended here on Tripadvisor. Payment is easy, straightforward, and safe as I paid via Paypal using a credit card for a discount. In return, I got use of a bike helmet, bike with basket and a water bottle.I selected the 3pm Heart of the City tour which left from the San Telmo neighborhood. It was a revelation seeing Buenos Aires by bike as the sounds, sights, smells of the city are more immediate. Our group of three visitors and two English speaking guides went to the neighborhoods of La Boca, the clean modernity of Puerto Madera and the natural splendor of the ecological reserve, Casa Rosada and Plaza de Mayo and then finishing up more than three hours later back in SanTelmo. The guides knew their history and were enthusiastic about sharing their knowledge of Buenos Aires. On our tour, I appreciated the opportunity to even try some Argentinian cuisine: a choripan sandwich at a parilla, some sips of mate, and an alfajor (a cookie made with dulce de leche and chocolate).Biking in Buenos Aires is a challenge. The dominance of cars, buses, and people can be overwhelming, but there is a guide leading and one following in the rear. They also took the initiative to even ensure our right of way is safe and clear by blocking cars from moving into our right of way. You should be in reasonable physical shape and confident on the bike as there can be some steep climbs in the park, and the roads are not necessarily evenly paved -- some roads are lined in cobblestones -- so be aware. There were opportunities for strolling some neighborhoods like La Boca and Plaza Durrego as well as checks by the guides to use washrooms. My one little criticism is that they should be more consistent in making sure that there is a guide at the end as it is intimidating to be the last one in the line and to have the shock of Buenos Aires traffic behind you.Buenos Aires can be a very intimidating city for the first time and solo visitor, and so seeing through this particular tour and in a group setting was an advantage. It's easy to sit back on a tour bus, but I think it's more rewarding to see a city using an approach that gives you ample opportunities to see the hidden and not so hidden histories of its city and its residents. To sit down with fellow travellers at a meal too was an unexpected delight.In an age where (rightly so) there is a growing awareness of the effects of mass tourism, this tour of Bicycling Buenos Aires offers an ecological step and social step in the right direction."

Yesterday we walked around the areas surrounding our hotel and were mostly unimpressed with Buenos Aires. Today we took the Ultimate Tour and, wow, we now realize that even 4-5 hours of walking yesterday wasn't close to exposing us to a quarter of Buenos Aires. Our guide, a guy named Karri, was excellent. He has a great personality to be a tour guide - laughing all the time and very helpful. He was also very knowledgeable and exercised the right amount of caution when leading us through the city. It can be a tiny bit intimidating riding through a major city on a bicycle but it certainly wasn't *very* intimidating as the majority of the ride is in bike lanes, most of which are protected by a concrete \"lip\" that prevents cars/motorcycles from entering.Overall the experience was excellent, with a lot of variety, including many stops to learn about Buenos Aires. The biking was broken up by some walks, including Caminito (sp?) and through the mammoth cemetary.I can't imagine a much better bike tour of this city. About the only nitpick I have is that we were provided a sport water bottle that was pretty grungy. Maybe Biking Buenos Aires could provide a factory-sealed 1 Liter water instead (even if it means raising prices by a USD$1."

I chose the South tour, since I spend more time in Palermo/Recoleta/Belgrano, and I was blown away by how much of the city I had been missing out on. The South tour takes you through some seedier parts of the city, but allows you to feel comfortable with the protection of a bike and a guide. It also tours the lovely Puerto Madero and gives you a taste of the ecological reserve. Even though drivers in Buenos Aires can be terrifyingly aggressive, I never felt nervous on the bike tour -- you mostly stick to bike paths and a few side streets. Our guide, Rodrigo, was also great -- he was very knowledgeable about the city and attentive to our needs (water, gloves, etc.).

This is a really excellent way to travel. These guys do a great job. It is a must do, here, and probably any other city that you visit."

This allows you to see BA a little more up close than riding around in a minivan, while covering substantially more ground (and sights) than you could on foot. The guides were considerate and gracious."

The bike itself was in great condition and I was lucky enough to get Cosmo (they have special names for the bikes). They made sure that we all stuck together or at least knew where to meet up or how to get ahold of them if we were to seperate (considering the hundreds of people those possibilities were high). I recommend this to anyone and everyone who is interested in having a great day and spending it with great tour guides! I couldnt recommend this more!"

I recently went on the tour of San Telmo, Puerto Madero, and La Boca with friends who live here and with some friends of ours that were visiting and seeing the city for the first time. The tour was awesome! I saw the city in a totally new way, even after over a year of living in Buenos Aires. The bikes are brand new (equipped with baskets, bells, name plates, and helmets), and the routes are scenic and safe. And, the tour guides are great - super knowledgeable, they make sure you feel safe while biking, we had a really fun time, and ate yummy bandiola sandwiches. Definitely check out Biking Buenos Aires!"

            "review": "The Best of Buenos Aires by Bike. We took 3 walking tours in Buenos Aires, all of which were very good, but the most fun tour was the one we took by bike. The bikes are brand new with both baskets and rear racks, padded handlebars, very comfortable seats, and bells used to alert pedestrians of your approach. Helmets are provided and the guides bring water, rain ponchos, first aid gear, and the makings of mate (the local tea) which we enjoyed during a rest stop on the shores of the Rio de la Plata in the Reseva. The tour started and ended in San Telmo and lasted about 4 hours, but we stopped often (Casa Rosada, Puerto Madero for sandwiches, La Boca to see the soccer stadium and the colorful neighborhood) so we didn't experience any leg or fanny fatigue. There are new bike paths throughout the city which made riding in congested traffic areas easier, but most of the tour was away from busy streets. The guides are enthusiastic, knowledgeable, humorous, helpful and patient (we stopped often to take photos). The day we went one guide was a native English speaker and the other spoke Spanish and French as well as perfect English. We had such fun as a group that we all went to a pub after the tour where we agreed that seeing Buenos Aires by bike was the best!"
