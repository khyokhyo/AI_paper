However, the hour spent queuing was soon fotgotten when we up the top in an amazing rotating cable car, which allowed everyone to get a complete view of the mountain and Capetown below it. We were very lucky in that the weather was fantastic - clear blue skies which meant that we could see for miles in every direction. About an hour after we came down, the famous tablecloth fog rolled in."

My plan was to use the cable car since I had read may warnings that it's dangerous for a solo traveller to climb the mountain, but the car was not closed on that day (and I was told that the forecast was not really promising), so after consulting an employee of the park, I decided to hike up the mountain. I hiked the Platteklip gorge track, and there were many other hikers, so I was not really solo :) I was lucky with the weather - the mountain had no cloth on that day, so the views were spectacular. Unfortunately, the hut was closed, so if you hike the mountain, check this and take enough water & snack with you.I also visited the botanical garden - on a nice, warm, sunny Sunday. It's a great spot to spend a day off."

If you are looking for something to do in Cape Town then a visit to this majestic mountain is a must! You will look hard to find such stunning views anywhere else. If you catch a Red bus at the Waterfront this will take you on a great tour through the city and will stop at the ticket counter at Table Mountain and you can then catch the bus back to the Waterfront (not sure of timetable). The views from the top of the mountain are simply amazing and you will see all the way to Robben Island as well as the southern suburbs in the other direction. You can take a scenic walk around the top as it has a few trails. There is a restaurant on top where you can get something to eat and drink. At certain times of the year you can go up the mountain after 6pm and you get tickets at half price. I do recommend you check the website for dates. It can get chilly up the mountain even if its a hot day so make sure you take something warm to wear."

We had a wonderful time exploring Table mountain :) Table mountain have kindly offer all citizens to go up the cable car on their birthday for free, so we decided to take the offer and what an amazing adventure we had.The cable car was awesome the way it revolves, showing off the mother city of Cape Town, lion's head. Walking along the paths were clear and easy to stroll while taking photographs of our magical Mountain. The carrrot cake, hot chocolate and coffee were delicious at the Mountain cafe. The Dussies were very friendly animals and natural posers in-front of the camera. Thank you for a fun day out Table Mountain"

After tasting both, it was like drinking warm water. No smell or taste of filter coffee. I took it back and told them. I was told they can replace it but it will taste the same. But I have to pay for it. R30 for cup of coffee. There's nothing they can do. Macdonalds coffee is way better than theirs.Maybe they should open a MacCafe. This is Table Mountain Restaurant, of which 90% of visitors are foreigners.They should have much better service.I won't go there again. Table Mountain itself is beautiful. Especially the hikes."

It was all worth while when we walked around the plateau. Stunning vistas, glorious fynbos in flower were everywhere we looked. Paths were uneven and steep in places depending on your route taken. This was certainly a highlight in our South African holiday and we'd recommend it, though doing a little homework beforehand such as prebooking cable car tickets, checking the weather, correct clothing and footwear made our special Table Mountain day positively memorable."

It is very important to be prepared and to let someone know where you are going in advance.as with any mountain range unexpected weather conditions can occur. Take water.sunblock.a hat and a warm garment. The obvious start to a walk on TMNP is from the Cableway road and one can either ascend the mountain via the cableway or climb Platteklip Gorge to the top. The climb starts further along the road from the cablestation and is signposted. It is a spectacular climb with wonderful views across the city and across the water to Robben Island. If you decide to go up the mountain by cable car there is a beautiful and varied walk for hikers from the top via Maclears Beacon to Kirstenbosch. It is approximately 12 kms and the views of the entire Peninsula are spectacular. Good boots are advisable. Maps of trails on Table Mountain are available at all book stores in Cape Town and it is advisable to obtain one as it is easy to take a wrong path. The mountain is beautiful and wild and in Spring the flowers are especially beautiful. It is possible to walk from Constantia Nek and further. There are many trails and one can walk to Cape Point in the Park.Enjoy the Mountain it is one of the Worlds special places."

Crossing the road we caught the FREE bus#110 to the Table Mtn. lower cable-way house.NOTE: you can only take a bus(other than the free one) with a MyCity bus card bought in grocery stores(R30) and then maybe loaded with R30. The bus cost us R16-20 return and quite a few tourists could not get the bus for lack of a card. Bus # 110 dropped us off at the cable way station and we walked down the road 1-11/2 kms to the start of the Platterklip Gourge hike. (big sign post, dont take the smaller one that you come to first) If you are young you could make it to the summit in just over a hr. It took us 2hrs to get to the summit.Even if you aren't a avid hiker as I am you can hike up there by taking it easy and drinking a lot of water.The hike is somewhat strenuous(sore thighs from high steps) but a wonderful accomplishment. You can of course take the cable car up and down. It took us 11/2 hrs to get down."

Well we booked and met at the lower cable car at 06:30 on 4 October. We met up with others in the group and started walking. The first bit was strenuous as it was quite steep but after a few stops to catch your breath we headed up. When it came to the rocks there were some challenging parts especially the vertical stages where there were handles glued into the rock face. After many stops to photograph the splendid scenery and catch your breath we started to go around towards the back of the mountain. The last stretch to the top was quite tiring but we made it. It was a truly wonderful experience and my wife wants to do it again next year! After taking in the view we took the cable car down and watched others hiking up the mountain."

The trail was more difficult than we had expected, but so worth it! We were here in July and there were many other people hiking, but not overly crowded. You had amazing views of the city along the hike up. And then the views at the top are just outstanding - gorgeous mountains all along the ocean. There is a great cafe at the top - serving food, hot beverages, beer, and wine. Being there in winter, it was certainly freezing at the top! Bring gloves!!! The weather changes quite a bit as you hike up, so be ready with layers. We started with short sleeve t-shirts and pants, then added on sweatshirts and down vest as we continued up. We took the cable car down which was a cool experience, but it made us very happy (and proud!) to have hiked it on the way up."

We took the Platteklip Gorge Hike, a 15 minute walk from where the tourist bus drops you at the cable car station. The hike is quite difficult - it is a bit of a scramble up rock steps, some of which were bigger than my short legs would allow! The journey up took about two hours, depending on your fitness. There is then an hours walk to the true top of the mountain, which is a much more leisurely walk, and an hour back to the cable car station. The restaurant at the top was very busy, but gave us the water and ice cream we needed by that point! Most people cable car it up and down, but where is the challenge in that?! Don't fall for it, it is much more rewarding to climb up, cheaper and helps to work off all the brilliant South African food!"

Don't pay for an expensive tour to show you to the top, there are many routes where you will be with other walkers. First tip, if the weathers good take water, you will be grateful for it, if the weather looks like it's going to close in - don't climb, when the cloud 'tablecloth' descends on the mountain there is no view and climbing would be difficult. We decided to climb the mountain as it was a lovely sunny day and this started from Kloof Corner, above the bend in the road a few hundred metres before the cable car. As usual there will be 'parking attendants' here that claim to help park you and look after your car in exchange for a few rand. From the Kloof sign, follow the path up for perhaps 30 minutes until you get to the corner where the path goes left. You follow this horizontally in the main, past the path up from the cable car and further than you think you should be going - maybe 30 minutes (there are few signs!!). You will finally meet the route up from Plattekip gorge where there will be many more climbers/walkers and from that point it's perhaps another 1 hour-11/2 hours depending on how fit you are as it gets more challenging. It's a good mornings work out and an achievement well worthwhile when you get to the top for the truly wonderful views of Cape Town and the surrounding areas.. I would suggest you don't choose to cable car up and walk down unless you are used to Snowdon etc as I think it's more difficult this way, especially negotiating climbers - we did see some people doing so that really shouldn't have started. At the top there is a caf\u00e9, 100+ photo opportunities and you can buy a ticket for the cable car down which is slightly quicker at around 5 minutes...the only cable car I have been on that rotates as it moves to give everyone the same views! The one way trip was around \u00a37.50 each and there can be a queue to board, especially at the weekends, took us around 30 mins. Enjoy!"

The Mountain threads through Cape Town from Cape Point (southernmost end) to Table Mountain (above the city) and around to Twelve Apostles (above Camps Bay and Llandudno). Most of the Table Mountain is a national park controlled and operated by Sanparks. Views from almost anywhere are superb, but pick your way up carefully. There are many points of access into the park and onto the mountain but I will give you some of my favourites. Easiest of all is the cableway. For a long easy walk start at Constantia Nek, From Kirtsenbosch there is one of the toughest walks up Skeleton Gorge, but you can also keep it easy by traversing left or right on the Contour Path. From Silvermine above Tokai there are shortish walks that dont involve much climbing. I will cover Cape Point National Park separately Now the caveats. Sanparks mandate, to the fury of Cape Town residents, is to eradicate aliens. Most alien deer have been culled, what use to be lovely shady walks under pines or gumtrees have been destroyed. There are virtually no animals to be seen in the park (the ones that are left are small, hard to spot and nocturnal). Sure there are quite a few birds but mostly all there is to see in this 'national park\" is fynbos, medium size bushes that only flower for a short period and then not too spectacularly. My point here - go the Park for the view in it and from it and not for fauna and flaura.And be warned, there are muggers on the mountain."

Bring water and sunscreen and stretch a bit because although some websites say this Skeleton Gorge hike is easy it's pretty tough! It's almost a direct ascent for the first few hundred meters up before it gets a bit more flat and winding. You also have to watch your step a bit as the rocks and stones are quite slippery. Took us 3 hours to get up there so on our way down mid afternoon we saw people coming up in jeans and trendy clothes thinking you're in for a tough afternoon as well as how the hell are you getting down! Up there the views are absolutely fantastic. Complete panoramic views and quite a bit of freedom to walk around on the top of the mountain. There's also a restaurant up there to eat and chill out while you rest your legs and prepare for the descent down."

This was a priority on our 'things to do' list, especially since my OH had been 3 times before and the cableway had always been closed due to bad weather!The previous 2 days to our visit had also been bad, with high winds, but luckily for us the sun was shining on our first morning in Cape Town, so we headed up there to make the most of it.First tip - don't try and drive up the hill and hope to find a place to park; it was virtually gridlocked when we attempted to do this, so we turned around and parked for free on the car park at the bottom of the hill. From there, we caught the shuttle bus (also free) up to the cable station. There are toilets here too (also free!)Second tip - book tickets online before you go. This saves time.As it was such a nice day (and it had been closed the previous 2 days), the queues were horrendous. Two lines were formed; one line was for people who had bought tickets online, these seemed to get priority to join the queue for the cable car.the second line was for the ticket office and was at least 3 times longer than the other queue.Third tip - don't rush to get a spot by the open window in the cable car. Once the car sets off, the floor revolves so everybody gets a panoramic view.At the top, we were rewarded with the most spectacular views, right across the Cape. Absolutely breath-taking and well worth the hours we'd had to queue."

There are three 'walks' up (one does require some climbing experience) so it is essential that you choose the one that matches your ability. You you have difficulty with walking then take the less energetic way up by means of the cable car! Do note that the cable car option is very popular and can mean that you have up to a two hour wait in a queue (this does depend when you go) before you reach the cable car. We decided to climb our way up to the top by climbing the Platteklip Gorge route. The route is 1.5 km long and rises approx 650 m. The average time to the top is around 2 hours, but the climb is strenuous if you aren't fit. Make sure that you take plenty of water with you, a sunhat and a camera. When you reach the top, the effort in getting there is well worth it! The views are amazing and when the weather is good you can see for miles. Robben Island (Nelson Mandela spent 18 years in captivity there) is clearly visible. Should you wish to visit the island you can do this as one of the options on the Red Bus Tourist routes.There is a cafe and tourist shop at the top where you can buy your mementos of your visit."

Including the great stops for viewpoints and lunch this took us 7hours.Note that when you go up from Kirstenbosch you pass Skeleton gorge. On this hikepath, you need to climb over rocks, and use ladders. Mountain gear is not required. What you need are proper walking shoes, ok physical condition and common sence.

We saw plenty of flowers and small wildlife! The trails/walkways are flat and very easy to navigate while there are also much larger routes to take as well. I would allow at least 2 hours up there at a minimum! While the place was very open for young children, there are not railings or anything to keep children away from the edge of the cliffs."

A chance to see breathtaking views of both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and then the culmination in the view from the lighthouse at the Cape of Good Hope is worth the time and the animals, flowers, and shrubs are a bonus!This was my second visit and will come back again.Many other things on the way to the park (especially the Penguins!) and many places to dine.Well worth a day of your visit to this region."

Not advisable when it is rainy / wet and we wouldn't do it the other way around (down from the top).From the top simply take the cable car down and take a taxi back to Kirstenbosch (aprox. 400 Rand),Good shoes and a fair condition are necessary to enjoy this fantastic hike to the fullest!"

The micro climate created by the mountain and the sea breezes makes for sudden changes to the weather which shrouds the mountain in its traditional \"table cloth\" of cloud. a bight cloudless day can be followed by one where the city remains under blue skies but the mountain is covered, when the cable cars do not run."

We were not completely prepared to hike, as we only had athletic shoes, but you can do fine with boots, or sneakers. You must bring water and I would recommend wearing light clothing and layers for the hike. We hiked in July, shorts, tank tops and a thin long sleeve worked great. If you see the weather is nice and clear, go for it! Weather changes quickly and winds can bring in visibility problems. We climbed to the top which you can then wander around the top of table mountain and take a short walk to the cable car to ride down. Views are incredible from the top. *Bring Layers*Bring water!*Be sure to have ample time to climb to the top and have a ticket purchased by 5pm. The cable car closes at 530pm. There is apparently ALWAYS a crazy long line, but it goes quickly, so don't be scared if it winds around the edge of the mountain top. Purchase your tickets in the gift shop at the cable car station before getting in line. *UBER picks up from the cable car.*Hike Up, don't be that person that only hikes down. It's worth it."

After a day of winds and heavy clouds when we were scheduled to visit Table Mountain, the sky cleared the next day and we made a mad dash for Table Mountain mid afternoon. It was a Sunday, we had pre-paid tickets as part of our Gate 1 tour of South Africa but the wait to ride the cableway up was about 45 minutes. You can walk up, some do, a few more seem to walk down, but you should be in shape and not mind the incline and loose rocks. The cableway is worth the cost and the cable car rotates 360 degrees as you ride. Horizontally, in case you're worried.Although it's called Table Mountain I really didn't expect it to be as flat as it is. We're not talking billiard table flat but I was amazed at how flat such a large expanse so high up on top of a mountain it is.There are a series of marked pathways throughout the top expanse and it is suggested that visitors stay on them. Many of the paths go to the edge at spots where there are low walls and/or safe viewing areas. However, many people ignored the warning, left the trails and went to the rocky edges. Of course these daring folks were limited to only those that had smart phones.The view down to Cape Town was spectacular. But I was really taken by the views in other directions. From down in Cape Town I couldn't fully appreciate what the mountain hid behind it including other significant mountains.As a warning, the wait for a cable car to go down was, for us, even longer than coming up. Maybe it's better on a weekday but whenever you can go it is definitely worth that inconvenience."

We were 12 friends that were hiking up Table Mountain National Park via Constantia Neck to the Sanparks Overseers Cottages.The scenery was breath taking, but we warned...the short trail is steep and the 3,5 km walk is not a walk in the park, if you are unfit. There is a longer, 5 km, Jeep Track that follow the contour of the mountain and is just as spectacular, but less strenuous. Walking at a leisure pace the long route will take just under 2 hours.The cottages have bedding and towels, but no electricity.They do provide lanterns (kerosene type) and solar led lighting. Warm water is supplied via a gas geyser. The main house have 2 inside showers and toilets and 1 outside shower and toilet. The smaller cottage only have an inside toilet and outside shower.You can take all you want (fire wood, food, drinks etc.) as long as you have booked well in advance with Sanparks and they will drive up the Jeep track and deliver your stuff at the cottages.You need to walk the whole route but the reward is sweet. You will overlook Cape Town and False Bay. When we visited, is was full moon...simply awesome if you are a natures lover.There are a couple of dams on the mountain that can be used to cool down. This is a must do if you like hiking and nature."

The path is a bit steep but it is accesible and ok. If you walk all the way from top to the bottom is around 1.30 hour but be careful.

The views it provides make it well worth the visit. You can see the whole of Cape Town and beyond, Robben Island and the mountains leading down to the Cape of Good Hope.There is a cafe and toilets up there plus the obligatory gift shop."

Cable car knows how to handle crowds and the mountain does the rest if the weather gods cooperate. An on line reservation saves time and is valid for 7 days if you happen to strike windy days."

The most recommended route the ridge straight up, but personally for me this is the LEAST enjoyable - yes it is the shortest, and some say the easiest because there is no actual climbing, but the continually stepping on boulders is so exhausting that it took the enjoyment out of it. The ridge takes 1.5-3 hours depending on your fitness lever, but in my opinion, I don't want to run up, or compete to be there in that, I WANT TO ENJOY THE HIKE. You can't enjoy this route because it is dirty and it has sooo many people. Much more enjoyable, although much longer route is the \"pipe\" route, that first goes around the mountain, and then up, and then you have hiking on top of the mountain with some great views. MUCH longer, but for me more enjoyable with different views. So if its just a matter of climbing the mountain then Ridge will do, but if you want to enjoy the hike and spend the day on table mountain, \"pipe route\" anytime."

            "review": "Table Mountain For Everyone. I've been running, walking and hiking on Table Mountain and in the rest of Table Mountain National Park for over 35 years. There's something for everyone, from the seasoned hiker to the person who enjoys a gentle stroll along the beach or in the woods. Occasionally security concerns are raised in the local press. I've never had an incident, but having been involved with Table Mountain security I can say that there are only a few \"hot spots\", and incidents are rare. Basically, exercise caution when on the urban fringe. I exercise caution at Noordhoek beach, Sandy Bay (avoid), Signal Hill, The Blockhouse, and Lion's Head. For the rest (95% of the National Park), it's more important to consider warm clothing, sufficient water, and avoidance of steep cliffs.For serious hikers there are various routes that allow one to walk up Table Mountain. All are pretty strenuous and require a reasonable level of fitness. My favourite route is up the \"back\" of the Mountain from Constantia Nek to the Cable Car. If the Cable Car is operating, you can take it down. A good idea because coming down the Mountain is harder (and more painful) than going up. The weather can be atrocious at the top of Table Mountain - like being in a freezing washing machine - but gentle and sunny at the bottom. So be prepared. Always take warm clothing, snacks, water, and rain gear. Shelter in a cave/overhang if necessary. The weather can change from mild to horrific very quickly. There are programs on social media that allow one to log one's hike with the Table Mountain Safety/Rescue people so that they can keep an eye on you. Nonetheless they rescue people from the Mountain practically every week. I usually hike by myself but it's apparently highly recommended to hike in a group.For those who want a more gentle experience I recommend Newlands Forest. Beautiful, shady, and safe. Difficult to get lost as \"downhill\" always takes you safely to a main road. Good for children.For beach strolls and great views try Cape Point reserve - expensive but superb beaches, some large mammals (Eland, Ostrich, Baboon etc), and safe. Take lots of water and sunblock! Noordhoek Beach is stunning but exercise caution unless in a large group. There have been a number of attacks down the beach towards the wreck. Exercise caution in swimming at any of the Table Mountain National Park beaches. The water is cold and the currents are strong.We are privileged to have this magnificent park in the middle of our city. I am grateful for it every day."

There are also a variety of routes to hike up the mountain, the most accessible being Platteklip Gorge. Take warm clothes, a rain jacket and plenty of water, as the weather can be deceptive from the bottom.

Be sure to take warm clothing even if sunny down below as the weather can turn quickly up on top and have good footwear for walking.Queues can be long so buy your ticket beforehand, it's valid for a week, you will still need to queue but it's a faster Bing one. There is a shop and cafe up top and the Red bus tour stops right at the door. A taxi from the waterfront is just over 100 Rand. Be sure and take a metered taxi.Do not forget your camera."

Its essentially a \" motorway\" so very difficult to get lost and generally plenty of others walking up it. it is a series of uneven steps that just goes on and on, so be prepared to cary plenty of water and a hat, since there is little shade with the sun beating down on your back until near the top. Make sure you have decent walking shoes or trainers with grip. Even in winter time the walk breaks you into a sweat! The views from the top are worth it and quite honestly, no abled bodied person should be taking the cableway unless the conditions are bad. It was a wonderfully satisfying family hike."

If you are up for it, the hike to the top took us 90 mins (although the route guide says it can take 2.5hours). It is absolutely worth the effort of hiking, although it's not a walk in the park, I would only suggest attempting if you are physically fit. Picking a day without cloud is crucial - I would not want to get stuck halfway up, and make sure you take the usual sun screen, water, jacket etc with you. The path itself is clearly marked and you arrive at the top of the mountain in the middle, away from the mass arrivals on the cable car. It's worth heading along to Maclear's Beacon for spectacular views with fewer people, before walking the length of the top to reach the cafe and the cable car back down. The queues at the end of August 2016 for the cable car were apparently almost an hour to get up, and about 30 mins back down, so get there early if you are taking the car up!"

You need to buy your tickets on-line with Webtickets if not going with an operator. You go in through the exit and take the elevator to 5th floor. there the staff are helpful and get you aboard the cable car quickly. On the mountain, some of the paths are rather awkward to get over - rough for chairs and bouncy, a push up the steep incline is manageable with a rest in between. The views are stunning and the atmosphere up there is magical. You cannot do a circular route due to steps at the cable station area blocking the way, but return via the same route. Spend at least 2 hours there to make it well worth your effort. New accessible loo in main cable station building is good. Parking though at lower cable station can be problematic with wheelchair users due to a step at disabled parking so disembark wheelchair users before you park. But enjoy this new \"7 natural wonders of the world\" and heritage site."

When we were half way, we saw a sign pointing to our left side saying \"to the top 2 hours more or less\" and one of us decided that we will not take the normal route, from that sign we climbed up, so we struggled 3 hours in the rocky area and we found ourselves in the middle of nowhere and the higher we got, the more freezing it was. So we decided to go down. It was rocky and I would suggest it for those who love rock climbing. We met some locals in the evening and they said the locals enjoy trekking the mountain in other seasons not winter. They said we are mad. Besides the weird experience, the view that you get while climbing is thrilling. The other option which is much easier is the cable."

I'd recommend buying tickets online to minimise the wait as you're likely to be on board within 20 minutes. At the top you are free to wander some considerable distance.

We had the intention of getting the cable car up, however with the weather been so sunny the queue was very very long!! We opted to hike it instead...even though a challenging and hot walk when you get to the top none of that matters, as the panoramic views over Cape Town are just magnificent! With walking up you kind of get an added thrill of a sense of achievement. We did get the cable car back down (you can purchase tickets to get down from the top and the queue wasn't that long). A must do if you are in Cape Town one of the best things I've ever done. Just make sure you book the cable car tickets in advance if you don't want to hike it!"

Second is to be aware of personal security. Try not to take valuables. There have been many muggings over the years. Please enjoy and try not to walk alone. Walk in groups."

While it was warm while waiting in the line to enter, it's colder and windier than you think when you get to the top of the mountain, so dress in layers. Order your tickets on-line prior to arriving so that you can wait in the shorter line to enter. Don't forget to hike on both sides of Table Mountain, as the views are incredible all the way around. Bring some snacks of your own as the restaurant at the top of the Table Mountain is VERY slow. Should have walked down on the descent, but that's not for everyone."

It took us just under 2 hours to reach the top and the same to get back down. The views from the top were sensational and well worth the hike. We went with a guide and he gave us lots of information about the mountain and park. He also made sure we took the walk steady and he knew the best path to take. We set off at 7.30am and were pretty much the first ones on the mountain. By the time we headed back down the mountain, the temperature had risen significantly and we met a lot of sweaty people going in the opposite direction. I would recommend setting off early, using a guide and wearing a good pair of shoes. Do not attempt to climb the mountain if you are not fit! It is also just as hard, if not a bit harder, coming back down the mountain than going up, but the feeling of accomplishment and the views are amazing and well worth the shaking legs."

The route we took was very physically challenging, mostly due to the need for flexibility and good footing and climbing up over rock faces. The first hour or two were quite strenuous, while the remainder of the time was slow-going and focused. There were yellow marks that helped guide us, although sometimes it seemed too long in between and we would get worried. We took the cable car down due to being exhausted and dehydrated."

The weather was excellent, so the views over Cape Town were spectacular. The route we took led us from the Platteklip visitor centre to Fountain Peak, from where we headed across to the peak of Table Mountain itself. The climb was steep and challenging, but the paths were well kept and it was absolutely worth it once we reached the top. The views over Cape Town and beyond were magnificent! If the day is clear, do it! One note of caution though: those who are less adept climbers would probably find it more pleasant to take the cable car..."

I visited Table Mountain on my first day in Cape Town as it was quite a clear day and had been told the weather can change very quickly. This was to be a good decision as we heard (not confirmed) when we checked out of our apartment that Table Mountain was closed for 2/3 days after we went up so would recommend going up the mountain as soon as possible when there is a clear day. The mountain itself has beautiful views of Cape Town and the surrounding areas and we decided to hike to the highest point of the mountain which was Maclears Beacon. This was not a strenuous walk for anyone with a reasonable level of fitness and is well worth while. The Rock Hyrax 'Dassies' are also very entertaining. When visiting Cape Town, I would fully recommend going to the top of Table Mountain."

Everything is still perfectly maintained, and as natural as could possibly be while taking the vat numbers of visitors into consideration! The vistas have become quite that of urban sprawl, but the overall Park has thus far succeeded in keeping a bit of the Fairest Cape of All intact for all the world to enjoy and bask in its glory!

I read online that the cable car would be down for routine servicing from 7/25-8/8 so I wanted to have the experience before it closed. Table Mountain is a National Park and it is open. The weather was beautiful so we decided to head up after lunch....with the rest of Cape Town!! The lines were so long, tourists and locals because it was the last day prior to maintenance. We waited in line about 90 min to buy a ticket and go up. Tickets are available on line but you must use them the day you purchase them so we opted to just get them at the ticket office. There are two separate lines (pre-paid and need a ticket). It's much faster if you have a ticket. You can also purchase a ticket while standing in line. There is Wi-Fi but it was difficult to get onto it - tons of people- and I'm not keen on purchasing things with my credit card on line with my phone. The cable car ride is quick but the view is breath taking. You will notice that there is an open area on the cable car that allows you to look out with an un-obstructed view, great for photos. People were trying to bum-rush their way to that spot - full disclosure, me too- however there is no need to. The floor rotates so everyone will have an opportunity to see out of the open space. :-)We were not at all prepared when we got to the top. We brought our jackets and hats because I knew it would be chilly at the summit but wow!! It was freezing up there. Keep in mind it is winter here but it felt like winter in Vermont up top! There is a very small gift shop right when you get off the cable car. We all bought hoodies and I bought gloves for everyone. We were still cold but it was much better. There were kids up there with shorts sleeves and short pants. They were miserable. There is a snack shop at the top where you can get warm drinks. So... what do you do when you get up there? Well, there are three walking trails. Very lovely. You can walk all around the perimeter and see the most spectacular views. If you go in the evening you can see an awesome sunset. Take a good camera, lots of photo ops. Please respect the trails. They have clearly demarked areas to walk on and still people and their rowdy kids were trampling through the plants. The plants are rare and beautiful. It's not hard to respect things. We spent about 3 hours up there including the wait to get down. It was worth every minute. Once again, if you have mobility issues you can go but may want to sit in the caf\u00e9 or on a nice rock. There are also picnic tables to sit on. Not wheel chair accessible at all. Not a place for infant strollers. Not a place for infants in winter - people where there with young babies.. crazy! it was just too cold. Perhaps the temperature in the summer might be better but I wouldn't take my infants up. Also, no pets allowed. I hope this helps!"

A city of 4.5 million people with a park that size determining its layout and geography? The central city nestles in the bowl created by Devil's Peak, Table Mountain, Lion's Head and Signal Hill. But that is only the northern tip of the Park, and it is exciting in itself. There is the cable car, a pretty shattering experience for first-timers, as the views grow and grow. Don't forget, this is a Real Mountain, over 1 000m high, so it will be on average 6 deg C (11deg F) cooler, and probably quite windy. The fit can climb Platteklip Gorge, the great slash across the face of Table Mountain. There are walks all over the Park, and it is so huge that a guide to the walks is absolutely essential, and you must tell people where you are going unless you have guide person rather than a guidebook.On the western side of the Park, you pass from the City over Kloof Nek, the gap between Table Mountain and Lion's Head.The peaks of the Twelve Apostles fall steeply to the sea, and there are picturesque communities along the coast.The road rises until you can look down on Llandudno, then plunges down into Hout Bay, which has a charming fishing harbour. Travelling further south you approach Chapman's Peak, with a spectacular road carved into the rock face that plunges into the sea. Looking across Hout Bay from the road, the proud Sentinel, 500m high, guards the entrance. After Chapman's Peak, the Park drops closer to sea level and you pass through Sun Valley and a series of small communities separated by long stretches of wilderness. At Misty Cliffs, the waves crash constantly at its foot and the spray rises up as a year-round mist. At Scarborough, you reach the northern edge of the Cape Point Nature Reserve, a 77sq.km wilderness that forms the southern part of the Park. The entrance to the Park is about 12km further.Travelling down the East side of the Park from the City, first you have to circumnavigate the slopes of Devil's Peak before turning South. The Eastern Face of Table Mountain has even larger cliffs then the front face, and as these end you reach Kirstenbosch, named one of the seven greatest gardens in the world. Its 500 hectares are packed with botanical riches, many of which are endemic to the area. Further south are the great vineyards of Constantia and Tokai before the Park's mountains return to the False Bay coast at the surfing paradise of Muizenberg. Then the edge of the Park is characterized by little communities stretching up the hillside or up narrow valleys. There is a gap at Fish Hoek, where one can cross the Park from False Bay to the Atlantic on the west, but otherwise the ridge which forms the spine of the Park is solid. Even at Simonstown, the naval base, the land plunges steeply to the sea. Further south, there are more tiny communities nestling under the mountains, some of which cannot be reached by car, before you climb up the the entrance gate of the Nature Reserve.But for the real National Park experience, a 74km stroll down the Hoerikwaggo trail is essential. It is a five-day, four night walk, starting at Cape Point and ending in the centre of Cape Town. The views along the way, with the oceans on both sides, the peace, the wild flowers, the animals, birds and insects combine to make this one of the greatest walks in one of the greatest parks in one of the greatest cities in the world."

Also you need a good head for some height exposure and basic scrambling. There are great spots to stop and to enjoy the views over the city, Lions Head, Clifton, Camps Bay. Always be prepared when you hike the mountain as the weather can change very fast, from a great sunny day to chilly, misty and ice cold wind.This hike can be done by most visitors if you are a regular hiker, have a head for height exposure and a mountain guide"

The yummy food and gorgeous selections of wines at the top off the mountain in the coffee shop, just completes the experience.Sip gently on a lovely glass of wine whilst watching the sunrise or set over the harbour, or contemplate the beauty off Mother Nature as you watch the Rock Rabbits sunning themselves lazily on the rocks. Either way, from the birdseye view of Robben Island to the vast expanse off the ocean, you will not want to leave the tranquillity off this stunning mountain. There is something for everyone!"

The top of the mountain has a beautiful cafe (with WIFI). Every hour there is a free walking tour. We did the shortest which lasted for 15 mins. we spent around 4 hours on top of the mountain. Got to saw some poisonous shrubs & dassie- the rabbit like badger inhabiting the mountains. The mountains offer fantastic views of western and eastern cape.

The geology and the plant life are very different from the area down around the harbor, and the air is so fresh with the breezes from the ocean. There is a trail that encircles the top of the mountain which allows you to look out in all directions from the harbor to the ocean, from the city center to the wealthy residential areas along the Atlantic Coast and on down toward the Cape. It is definitely worth a visit, but plan your visit when the mountain is not enshrouded by fog. While the mountain would still be great, you would miss the view!"

The path is rocky steps and well maintained. Views from the top are spectacular but be prepared to walk down if windy, as they will close the gondola. We hiked up and down from the road in four hours including half an hour up top, which was very cold. Hoodies, windbreakers, and gloves recommended! The rest of the park is gorgeous and a wonderful day trip by car from Cape Town. Beautiful rugged scenery, some wildlife, beaches, and memorable coastal roads. Be sure to see the Penguins at Boulders Beach and baboons and ostriches at Cape of Good Hope."

Taking a camera is a must, but hold on tight; the wind is unpredictable and nobody wants to watch their camera device floating off down a mountain40 rand per adult gets you up the cable car and out into the visitor areaI'd suggest taking gloves as the temperature is much lower than at ground level. ..especially if it isn't a particularly sunny dayIf you fancy a drink whilst you're at the top, expect to pay 90 rand for 2. The local Castle Lager is marginally cheaper than Peroni. Top Tip would be to ask for an extra plastic cup for your drink otherwise your fingers will be freeeezing when you go back outsideThe mountain top itself is flat and there are paths laid out to walk, but there are so many beautiful spots to be found when you cut out into the spaces with just rocky pebbles underfoot you'd miss out on a lot if you stick to the trail.Go explore and enjoy"

Should not be more than 2 hours, even if you stop every 5 metres to catch your breath! Take a taxi there, so that you will be brought to the entrance of the trail...which is farther away from the cable car drop-off. Also look at the Table Mountain website to check if the cable car is operating, otherwise you will have to walk down, and that's another 2 hours, and murder on your knees."

I prefer to believe that it is due to the Table Mountain. Table Mountain is like a mother, standing in the center of Cape Town, overlooking this piece of land and shelter them from the storm. If you come to Cape Town without visiting Table Mountain, you will certainly regret! Do make sure you check the weather forecast frequently as the cable car schedule will be impact by the strong wind, frequently. Of course, you can always hike your way up and down Table Mountain when the cable car service is being interrupted. The flora and fauna at Table Mountain are very special, especially for us that grew up in tropical countries. Hiking should be a good choice. Otherwise, you can buy a single ticket (R125) up the mountain, enjoy the view, have brunch and then walk down the mountain. We are lazy so we choose two-way cable car. (it is best to buy ticket online so you can avoid the queue). We arrived around 8:30am at the cable car station. Tourists not yet flooded the place so the process was pretty smooth. The cable car can rotate 360 \u200b\u200bdegrees, so do not race to the window for photograph opportunity. Your chance will come.I planned to join a few free walking tours to learn about the plants and animals. However, the scenery was so breathtaking that we totally forgot the time and missed the tours. We bought coffee and muffins from the cafe, and enjoy them at the picnic tables outside. Nothing beat the best view!"

HOWEVER, there are incredible hiking trails, all pretty easy for even a novice hiker, that allow you to explore the mountain even more and provide breathtaking views of the city as well as towards Cape Point. If you do like to hike, give yourself a few extra hours on the mountain top to explore. You won't regret it."

On a clear day, the view from the top is breathtaking, as seen from numerous photos of the scene taken therefrom. We were not so lucky on the morning we visited resulting in a visibility of about 5 meters thereat. To reach the top, one may run, walk or take a short ride in a cable car. It is really convenient.

My advise is to only buy ticket online when you are there to see the queue length. I had a queue that went more than 1 hour long, and I took the other Lane that sent me immediately to the cable car waiting point since I had an online ticket. But you can also buy it days ahead to be assured a place.Go in the afternoon from 11:30 onwards, and prepare to spend 2-3 hours at the top. There's so much to be seen by walking and taking photos, we almost couldn't come down.Morning guys can do a lunch as there's a nice cafe and tourist shop at the top.

Getting on top of Table Mountain takes a while, depending when you start off, best to go early: fewer people in the queue at the cable car and less tourists stumbling around and making selfies on \"the table\" of the mountain which is laid out in pathways you have to follow. The farther you go the better and wilder. Of course, climbing up/down is an option for the fit ones. The 360 degree view is massively impressive. The flora is diverse and lizards and birds are all around, as well as cute dassis crossing your way. If you're looking to take a pebble as souvenir you'll have a hard time ! You'll get back to sea level happy to have conquered one of the new official 7 world wonders !"

Table Mountain is by far the city's number one attraction, a must see for all those visiting. As soon as you arrive in Cape Town you can spot the 3 kilometers (2 miles) long plateau dominating the landscape, a beautiful sight visible from almost every corner of the city. Table Mountain is often engulfed in clouds which the locals refer to as the \"tablecloth\", so the advice you get is to head for the mountain on the first clear day of your visit. To get to the top you can either hike up or take the cable car. If you decide to take the cable car know that the lines can be long in the morning but seem to dwindle in the afternoon. On a clear day everyone heads for the mountain first thing in the morning because the cable car stops running if the fog rolls in or the wind starts to blow. Conditions at the top can change quickly and if that happens you may have no choice but to return on foot.The cable car first opened in 1929 and the one that is in use today has a 360 degrees rotating floor so by the time you finish the ride you have seen the views all around. If there's a long line at the cable car you can skip a part of it by buying your ticket online (you can do it beforehand or on the spot using their WiFi). At the top one is rewarded with breathtaking views of Cape Town and the surrounding area, of the coastline and the Atlantic ocean. There are plenty of vista points and a network of walking trails. Also at the top there's a cafeteria and souvenir shop. The highest point on Table Mountain measures 1,086 meters (3,563 ft) above sea level. Ant\u00f3nio de Saldanha, a Portuguese ship captain, made the first recorded ascent of Table Mountain in 1503. He is the one responsible for naming the mountain Taboa do Cabo (Table of the Cape)The mountain was picked as one of the \"New Seven Wonders of Nature\" a fact that is being heavily advertised around the cable car stations. We got to the cable car station on the red hop on hop off bus. Alternatively you can drive there or take a taxi."

Most visitors stay within the first 100-150 m from the entrance, so even if it looks very busy, if you are prepared to walk for 5-10 minutes, you will find an isolated point to enjoy the landscape and let the fresh air clean your head and soul. I did, and I only had 20 minutes available for that. Can't think of a visit to Cape Town without going up there. Tip: if you have pre-booked and paid for the funicular, you will avoid long queues and won't wait long to get into it. Take something warm up there, it can be very cold, at 1000+ of altitude. Make sure you check timetable, it closes early."

Be early as we were and avoid the cableway queues and have the place more to yourself. We were extremely lucky in having sun and no wind. The views are of course magnificent and we walked around the area nearest to the cableway in an hour or so. There is wildlife in the form of birds and dassies. The top is not flat but full of rocks so you have to stick to the paths."

On the best of days, one can see as far as Cape of Good Hope.At an altitude of approx. 1,000 metres, Table Mountain appears from the city as a \"flat top tableau\". Once you are there, and take the cable car to the top, you will be amazed at how rugged it is. You will have a choice of 3 walks (short, medium - 15 minutes, and long). Rodent type creatures and birds are also within range of a typical camera."

Once at the top you are free to stroll (on marked pathways) for quite some distance. The views are spectacular and binoculars are worth carrying if you have them. If not, take time to pick out landmarks from the city and beyond. Can't comment on the food offerings but people were sitting happily at tables and did not appear irritated at all.

We decided to get taxi to the bottom of the hiking area which is about a 3-5 minute drive beyond the cable car. We were hiking with my 64 year old father so we were quite nervous about the difficulty of the walk. It is certainly a testing hike for anyone without a base level of fitness and is quite steep in parts. I would also recommend doing this early morning before the mid-morning heat kicks in which definitely makes it more challenging. Also do ensure you have plenty of water and appropriate footwear. Once you get to the top of the the mountain though, all your efforts are rewarded with stellar views of Cape Town. Definitely one of the highlights of an excellent trip and would recommend the hike if you feel able to."

I would highly recommend you do a hike or walk when you are in Cape Town as you see the beauty of the place in a different way and are able to get views that you could not get from any car or at ground level. The best area to walk are in the Table Mountain National Park area which is vast and covers most of the Cape Peninsula. We did 3 walks that really stood out : to Chapmans Peak, the Pipetrack above Camps Bay and the Two Oceans walk from Cape Point. We also did Lions Head which has sensational views but certainly in Feb was quite crowded with walkersIt is not advisable to walk alone."

It was good time to start. So we walked up and took enough breaks - take water with you and a snack. It is relatively heavy but worth it. The view and sun rising over Cape Town was breath taking! On the top we took about 1 km walk at the far end of the park. Beautiful spot for breakfas and we didnt see anyone else during the whole breakfast. I would recommend to leave the cable area and see the emptines and view a bit further away. Atmosphere is very different."

You are supposed to go to Table Mountain in a clear sunny windless day to enjoy the view, and in these kinds of days, there is almost no shade to rest on you way up there.Don't forget to take a lot of water with you. That's the most important element. The view is pretty nice too everywhere you look. It took us 2h30 to get there, I arrived there very tired but could make it up by taking beer in the bar on top of the mountain. After getting on top, I was pretty happy I'd done it.

On top of the mountain there are various walks you can do - from flat, paved, short walks taking in the sights of the city, the beaches and beyond - to longer, more strenuous walks.

As a matter of fact, the only clouds were BELOW us which made for some amazing vistas. We did a great 5K hike all around the top over to Maclear's Beacon. We were fortunate enough to meet an experienced hiker along the way who pointed out several indigenous plant to the Table Top region. It was a good hike, fairly flat, with just a few steeper climbs (which has a chain for support). I highly recommend this hike. We did come across several folks asking after water. There is NO water once you leave the populated area at the top of the cable car. Be sure to carry your own and wear comfortable shoes. It is so worth it!"

Notwithstanding the panorama that it provides, especially on a clear and sunny day, the ride on a rather unique cable car allows photographers the chance to capture the views from a 'car' that rotates 360 degrees both ascending and descending through open windows that eliminate irritating glass reflections. As a tip I would suggest standing close to the entrance door when boarding. In this position the car is some distance from the start and finish when you rotate to the open windows that are at both front and rear of the cable car. I would also advise that travellers arrive early since queues can be extremely long later in the day"

Big enough to find yourself alone among caves and gorges, yet popular enough that you never felt you could get into too much trouble and there's even a place to get a beer on Table Mountain itself! Terrain reminded me of the Scottish Highlands in a way and the views of the city and ocean below and around were peerless. Lions Head was especially impressive and a wonderful climb. Will be back again and again."

Unlike the Eiffel tower which gives you a specific time for your reservation, getting a ticket in advance does not prevent you from standing in line for hours in the hot sun. It was very disappointing to have such a long wait and since we had set a pick up time with our tour guide, we did not have much time at the top. The ride up is on a cable car that rotates. The views from the top are spectacular as promised. But since it was a beautiful day, it was crowded. Everyone will warn you about the winds. If it becomes too windy they easily shut down the cable cars. Beware."

We got to the base of the mountain to get in line at about 8:30 Am and there was already quite a line. I would suggest that you buy your tickets online before you visit to save yourself from having to line up for the tickets. We easily spent half the day exploring the mountain and could have spent even longer if we didn't have other things to see.

The sheer panoramic views of Cape Town, the Atlantic, and the mountains will leave you stuns. At times you are above the low lying cloud and that just adds to the majesty of this place. The experience is very streamlined to but I would suggest booking your tickets in advance as the ques can get quite long and in the heat of the day you dont want to standing around. There is also a little issue with parking, it's along the road and not a car park so a taxi or getting there early is advised. After that however everything else I wow. You start by taking a cable car to the top which is an experience in it's own right. The floor of the cable car spins slowly round so no matter what point you are at you will get 360 views of your ascent abd decent. You can choose to hike up and take a cable car down or vice versa but that will be an all day excursion. Once at the top you are free to walk around the paths and off them to and your are only limited to where you can go by the mountains edge. There is a lovely cafe/restaurant and gift shop as well as toilets but be warned the price is quite expensive and once at the top there is no where else to buy food and drink so I would again advise that you take your own. On your decent you can again get caught in ques due to there only being two cable cars but this ti e you are in doors and you still have all the views to take in whilst you wait. An amazing sight to behold and I would 100% recommend."

We did not do it on this trip but hope to do it again in the future. If you decide to do the hike, PLEASE remember to start early before the heat strikes, take water and sun protection. Also let someone know of your intentions to hike up the mountain and contact them once you are at the top. It is worth it to hike up and cable car down. A must for every visitor to Cape Town."

The views from the top are spectacular. You can hike around at the top for a long time with out having to hike up or down if you do not want to. If you are worried about the line for the cable car, skip some of the wait by booking your tickets on line ahead of time. Doing so cuts down about half of the wait time. As mentioned in several reviews, if you drive to the cable car station, expect a long walk to your car as there is very little parking close to the station."

We were in Cape Town for 5 days and this was on the only day out of 5 that the cable car was open due to high winds throughout the week.We arrived around 10am in the morning and the queue waiting time was around an hour (not sure because it had been closed for a while or because it is very popular) either way i suggest buying and booking tickets online. When yo do get your ticket make sure you keep it for going back down unless you want to walk.The queue kinds of twists and winds its way upwards towards to foot of the cable car. On the way up in the queue there is a vendor selling cold drinks, someone to take your photo as a momento and toilets. At one part of the queue you have to get into a lift and when you exit the lift the queue that had been so well up until know goes completely out the window and its a bit of a free for all, and the staff keep sending groups of people up in the lift so the area toward the bottom of the cable car is unorganized and crowded.Once ready to get into the cable car (there are 2) they fit around 60 people. The is a member of staff in the centre who gives some history about the cable car and the mountain. The floor rotates round and round until the top so everyone can see everything. The whole journey to the top is around 3 minutes.When you get to the top you can walk around and around and the view never gets old. You can see for miles! There are wild animals at the top, just leave them be and dont feed them. Also at the top there are shops, toilets and cafes. You can spend as long as you want at the top, I think the last cable car down is around 7pm.To exit is very simple, there is no queue just show the ticket, get into the cable car, the floor will rotate again and within a few minutes youre back at the bottom.By far this is one of the best things to do in Cape Town as you can say you have been to 1 of the New 7 Wonders of the World and the view from the top is magical."

Quite easy if you fit but if you not be so kind to let people behind you get past. Can get a bit noisy at times so if you looking for a quieter route go somewhere else. In summer start walking before 6:30 to miss the sun. If you not in the crack by the time the sun comes up it gonna get very hot. Carry lots of water as it is tiring. Please keep all your bottles with you though till you get down- carry a plastic bag to throw dirt into. Found so many plastic bottles and packets from ignorant holiday makers.When you get up to the beacon only a 15min walk to the cable car but try and find the route to Echo Valley and Kasteelpoort much more quieter and great views of the Atlantic Seaboard (Camps bay, Llandudno and even Houtbay). Only a 45min round about.In total if you in a good condition walk should take you 1:30 up and the another 45min on the Echo valley route. Cable car fun to go down, get tickets online easier. Don't waste your time at the restaurant super expensive. Alternatively walk down takes about 50min fitness dependent.Trail is fairly easy so young kids can manage worth lots of breaks."

We were up the top by 8:50 so much quicker than we thought. It is absolutely spectacular and we were there for about 4 hours. Sensible footwear essential if you want to walk around. Loved it!

It was over 100 degrees (F), but there was shade provided, along with places to buy water and sunscreen. The system going up the cable car was efficient and well-managed. The views from the top of Table Mountain are hard to explain. It's just beautiful everywhere you look! There are nice walking paths around the top, and none of them are very long. There is a cafe, bathrooms, and a gift shop at the top as well.We had another 90-minute wait to go back down, and this queue wasn't managed as well. It was fine until we got inside the building past where they scan your tickets. After that people were pushing and shoving trying to get into the cable cars, and the whole scene was just obnoxious--not nearly as well-managed as the ride up had been. That was really the only downfall though. This is a must-do activity on a visit to Cape Town!"

We also thought there was just one way up and down. Three years ago we moved to Cape Town from Gauteng and our first hike was up Platteklip Gorge. I didn't sleep the previous night, was scared to death, but we made it to the top, had a slice of milk tart and coffee on top and hiked back down again. It was a good start, as it is an easy route, but now it became a bit boring and over crowd.After that, we bought a Table Mountain guide book and already did about 35 different routes on Table Mountain. We joined a small group of very experienced hikers and they share their knowledge of plants and history freely. We have grown to love some adventurous scrambles and enjoy hiking off the beaten track. The most beautiful old trees, moss and ferns can be seen in the more desolated places. We have seen all kinds of fynbos and flowers, every time we go there is something else to see. The Disa flowers from December to February and can only be found in a few places, usually in or near streams. We saw caves that go deep into the ground, waterfalls big and small and rock formations which looks like animals, and that is usually interesting, because everyone in the group has another perception of what it is supposed to be.For me a walk up Table Mountain feels like a journey into myself. Although you need to be fit, have a head for heights, you also need to be able to stay calm when things don't go according to plan. Sometimes you lose the track or come to a point where it seems impossible to go over, but if you focus and tackle it gradually, you always manage to find a way. I enjoy the team efforts and we really came to trust each other in the group. It can be dangerous if someone let some rocks loose on you. Table Mountain is a lot like life, an uphill journey with disappointments, obstacles and surprises, but the view and achievement of reaching the top, is worth the effort."

So if like us you have no real choice but to take your opportunity when you can then you need to monitor the website 'tablemountaincablecar' it will tell you the current status of the cable car. When it turns to open jump a cab and get there soon as you can, makes the difference between a 30 min wait and 3 hours!! It is a great trip and certainly worth some effort."

Even with the tickets, we waited 1.5 hours in line to get on the cable. I believe this is because we were there at the busiest vacation time of the year. Hopefully, this will not be the case for other seasons. Once arriving, you have free access to roam the mountain top on trails and vista points. Great views!

The view and atmosphere is incredible, we had a lovely walk and hung out for about 2 hours at the top. I would definitely go again and again if I lived in Cape Town!! Loved it!"

It took us about an hour and forty minutes to reach the top. The route is easy to follow. It starts steeply, then winds around the mountain and climbs again. The main difficulty for us was the heat. We started at 7am but wished we had started an hour earlier so that we could have walked in some shade. We could see the path shaded up ahead of us but by the time we reached it, it was in full sun.But the views from the top were glorious - worth every drop of sweat and ache.We felt that we had earned this glimpse of paradise.We descended by the same route and really pitied the poor people struggling up in the even more intense heat of mid morning.So walk up BUT go early to avoid the crowds and the heat."

I didn't find it too bad, but I've done quite a lot of trekking in the past. Took me about 2.5 hours from starting out at entrance to Kirstenbosch Gardens to Maclear's Beacon though I tend to go at a fairly rapid pace (most seemed to be taking 3- 3.5 hrs). If you've done any good full day uphill treks before you shouldn't find it beyond you, and I have to say the experience of walking up Table Mountain is vastly more enjoyable and rewarding than going up in a Cable Car - so if you can walk it, do it!Great views once more both all the way up and then at the summit.For those just getting the Cable Car up - walk across Table Mountain!!!! I was staggered when I got to the Cable Car end to hear moaning that it was a bit cloudy and so the views were not great. Weather and cloud conditions vary greatly across the summit (at the other end, towards Skeleton Gorge, it has been practically clear skies) so walk about and you will get more (and different) views. Plus as you walk further away from the Cable Car end the crowds dissipate and you soon have tranquility to enjoy the stunning views."

We purchased our ticket online the night before, which I would recommend doing. Even at 10am the line was very long and we probably waited about an hour and a half. It was an extremely hot day, so bring a water bottle and sunscreen. If you forget though, they have some for purchase. There are shops and a cafe (reasonable prices and lots of choices) up at the top. It's truly a beautiful place and you can make your stay as long or as short as you'd like. I was happy to see that it was wheelchair friendly; there were at least three folks in wheel chairs up there. Wear comfortable shoes to walk around, clothing appropriate for the weather, and your camera. Also, know that there will be a line to get the cable car to get back down too. That line was not as organized as the first one and we were very squished in the hallway- my only complaint about the attraction."

Don't be scared, the warning signs can be easily ignored if you don't have kids under 10 or are somehow not able to do a few big steps. The route is very scenic and not as busy as the Gorge route. Ontop, it does not only consist of steps but varies a lot more.VERY IMPORTANT: take AT LEAST 1.5 l of water with you, as you cannot hope for the cablecar to be opened which also means that there are no opened shops up there. But luckily there is a small drinking fountain at the cable way station up there, so you can refill your bottles (still 1.5 l are quickly gone on the way up).For the way down, I guess the Gorge is alright, still you get tired quickly from all that steps."

Almost everyone was complaining about how cold it was, and I am from Wyoming, so I know cold! If you have a coat you will be fine. None the less, the scenery was breathtaking making this trip so memorable. I've never seen sites like the ones on Table Mountain, with the clouds rolling of the mountain crest. If you are in Cape Town visiting, Table Mountain is an absolute MUST SEE. It truly will take your breath away."

The cottage (actually two cottages in their own fenced off grounds - sleep up to 16 but only bookable by one group at a time) are located right next to the \"Jeep Track\", the concrete path that leads from Constantia Nek up to the top of the mountain, on the far end from the top cable station. Driving up is only permitted for National Parks vehicles, but if you don't fancy or can't manage a strenuous walk then its possible to meander up the Jeep Track in an hour or two, while it is a little steep its relatively easy and safe even for groups with small children. The National Parks staff drive your kit up before your stay and down when you finish, so you can take plenty to eat and drink - there is a fully equipped kitchen and an outdoor braai (barbeque) area. Near the cottage are several reservoirs and a small but interesting historical museum. The cottages are not luxurious but are spacious and the decoration has some nice touches compared with some of the more basic National Parks accommodation - including very comfy beds. The views at night (if the clouds clear !) are superb, over the Cape Flats to the Hottentots Holland range. If you want to do more challenging walks, then after leaving your kit at Constantia Nek you can come up from Kirstenbosch (Skeleton Gorge or Nursery Ravine) in 2-3 hours, or in a similar walk across the top of the mountain (several ladders and steep drops) to the cable car. Special mention to Sabrina Adams and Mxolisi Magwaxaza of National Parks for their efficient and friendly assistance."

Firstly, you must book you tickets in advance if you want to visit the table mountain to avoid standing in a long queue.A quick tip to save few bucks:If you visit it after 6pm, you will get 50% discount. So plan accordingly.The floor of the cable car rotates within the cable, you will get a 360\u00b0 view of the city on your way up. Once you reach there, read all safety instructions carefully. This will help you, should there be any harsh weather condition which require the visitors the leave the place. Make sure to visit all sides of the table mountain, once you are on the top. You will get a panoramic view of the entire city.If you are driving, it is advisable to park your car at the free table mountain parking at lower table mountain car park, next to the information centre. From there, you can take a free ride in a MyCiti bus, which takes you to lost cable station."

Sitting on the mountain and watching the sun go down with all the colors and light over the city, ocean and mountains is just amazing. HOWEVER, a few things i would recommend if you're going for the sunset: 1. Bring warm clothes!! It gets windy on the mountain and after sunset it gets freezing cold. 2. Be aware that if you go for sunset you'll not be the only one leaving the mountain right after. Therefore, the line to the cable car gets really long. We didn't get down until 2hours after sunset.

Still, don't let the staff scare you with horrific times for queuing. We were told we would have to wait three hours to get up and two to get down again - it turned out it was 1.5 hours to get up and some 25minutes to get down. The organisation of the cable cars works quite well so as terrible as the queue might look it's not that bad (if you have online tickets already!)Unfortuanately we had more plans that day and therefore had way too little time.

You can get the cable cars back down for about 120 rand one way.A few things to note if you're considering doing the same:- It was definitely not easy for some of us and I would recommend being of average fitness level. - go early!! If you do it in summer go at 7am, we did it this early and still was 28\u00b0 by 9am.- totally fine to wear runners!- take at least 2L of water in your back pack, plenty of sunscreen and a light snack like a banana!- Don't take any valuables and minimal money.*Warning!* The option of taking the cable car back down is good a one.. however..if the conditions are not suitable the cable cars won't run so be prepared for this!Unfortunately this happened to our group due to windy conditions, but it definitely didn't take away the AMAZING views from the top, and it was an awesome achievement.I would do it again and I wouldn't miss it if you come to cape town!"

In the summer months, it starts to get hot really early and it seems to be one of the most popular times of the year, so it's best to get there around 7/7:30 LATEST to ensure you're one of the first people on the cable cars and up the mountain. Once it gets started at 8:00AM the line moves pretty quickly. Also, bring your own food, not because the food is expensive, but because the lines become outrageously long for the restaurant area and you're stuck spending most of your time in line buying a water when you could be doing other things."

The revolving cable car was a novelty.We were fortunate to visit on a day when the sky was blue and clear and were rewarded with stunning vistas of the beautiful city of Cape Town. The paths were a little rough in places but were easy to navigate. There were plenty of vantage points where one could linger and look.The facilities on the mountain were good with clean toilets. We visited as part of a tour group so had a limited time on the mountain. I would suggest making a private visit so that you can spend more time drinking in the views."

It took one hour to reach the down cable car, and due to the mist, the view from the top was not great. Overall, you don't miss much even if you just look down from the car park.

We did that, got up early and arrived at the Cable Car station just after 8am to find a 4 hour wait!! We decided not to and return another day, later in the day. It is well worth a visit, so top tips are: - buy an early access pass (giving you access at 7:30 - there are limited tickets and cost ~ 90 Rand extra)- Buy a ticket on-line, do not leave it to buy a ticket at the station- Buy an afternoon ticket when you first arrive (they are valid for 7 days) - Keep an eye on the weather and if looking good, make a decision to get there around 4pm (we did and waited no more than 45 minutes and the queue moved quickly) - With your pre-purchased tickets join the green queue Take your camera, walk around the pathways and enjoy the splendid views."

We chose to hike up and take the gondola down. The hike up is strenuous. You need be in decent shape. It will take a couple of hours and is straight up. Bring water. Otherwise the aerial tram is a great way to get up and down. Get tickets ahead of time if you can because the lines can be quite long. Once you get to the top, I suggest you reserve the time slot when you would like to go back down. By reserving a time you will avoid standing in a long line waiting for space on the next tram. Be sure to give yourself at least a couple of hours to enjoy the top of the mountain. Food service at the top is crowded and even though it is feeding the masses it has better than average selections. The outdoor patio is the best place to take your food."

The tickets had a 3 day window, and we needed to book either am tickets (up till 1pm), or pm tickets (after 1pm). We chose am tickets and got there at 12.30. Directions around the city were very clear, as we were in a hire car. There are a lot of chaps wearing orange vests around the parking. These guys are not official - but trying to assist for a tip. I was a bit suspicious at first, but got used to this all around SA. They don't ask for a lot, and are usually very helpful and courteous - better than begging. There was a lot of traffic parking a long way from the cable car, which looked like parking was a problem. It wasn't. Keep going up the mountain to the cable car, and out the other side where there is more parking much closer to where you need to be. There are two queues. Trust me, you want to be in the PREPAID one! Seemed long, but got on the cable car fairly quickly. When aboard, the floor rotates so everyone gets a view on the outside edge. Then take your time. Big space which soaks up the crowds, and makes the place seem serene. Amazing views particularly to the south towards Camp Bay. Our view towards the city was hazy which didn't look great on the photos. The cafe has everything from a quick sandwich, beer, or a full sit down three course meal with wine - the first point in our holiday and the realisation that our English pound goes a long way i.e. cheap! Gets busy but worth the wait. Souvenir shop is tiny. A must do when in Cape Town.Saw many walking up and down. If you've got the time, well worth doing. Proper stone steps on the path. Wouldn't like to do it in the midday heat. Next time...If you can see the table (not the cloth of cloud) from town, go quick. The weather up there changes real fast and might not clear again for days."

We climbed Table mountain using platteklip gorge route and let me tell you that the trek is not easy at all even for fit folks - it is mainly a vertical climb of 1000 meters over many rocks and even young folks who looked very fit were exhausted and stopping fo rest many times. Some times this is not clearly explained on sites talking about hiking to table mountain. We were there on Dec 29th and because it is holiday time, our cab dropped us to the lower taffleberg shuttle stop and took forever to even get there. The shuttle takes you to the cable car station. From this stop, you have to walk 15 minutes to get to the platteklip gorge point to start your trek. It takes easily more than 2 hours unless you are super fit to climb and the climb is not easy. Once you are up there though, it is the most beautiful feeling with best views and the table cloth (clouds on top of the table mountain) and sights that are unparalleled of lions peak, devil peak, the quay, etc. The cafe there is good but please do not order Veg pita and instead go for salads, pizzas, other items.

It was a 2hr hike/ climb to the top, and then 1h15 over the Table plateau itself. We started at 7:15am, which was an ideal time (we had quite a fast pace, as the table plateau walk was noted as 2h). The view is amazing, and we were so lucky to have a clear and blue sky. The weather is peculiar when it comes to the Table, because the clouds usually cling to the peak, and sit there for a few days. So if it's sunny, go for it. It can be dangerous if you go when cloudy (the peak of the table is 1100m).If you want to take the cable, get there as early as possible, and get your tickets online because otherwise you're going to queue for at least 2hours.

I suggest that you do it the FIRST day you are there (if it is a clear day) since there is no guarantee that other days will be as clear."

Wear comfortable walking shoes there are a lot of walking paths and some are uneven. I was told to be aware also that the site does not open if the weather is too foggy or windy and the cable cars stop running so you may have to walk down if the weather changes after you have already gotten to the top. However you don't have to use the cable cars if you want to hike there are paths that you can take. Good for all ages. If you want to avoid the ticket lines and you are going to take advantage of the city sightseeing hop on hop off bus then you can buy your ticket from them at the time you purchase your bus ticket. There still may be lines for the cableway though."

It is beautiful if you are looking at Table Mountain, and it is also beautiful when you are on the summit, overlooking Cape Town.We took the cable car, and it is a lovely ride up to the summit. As we know why it is called Table Mountain, once you reach the summit, it is like a plateau. So, you quite a lot of walking to do if you want to view 360 degrees of Cape Town. It was a very hot day when we visited in early December and there is no shades or trees , ensure you have your sunglasses and sunblock. We enjoyed this place in Cape Town, though I personally felt Lion's head, Signal hill is a more beautiful, less touristic, and the most beautiful scenery you are enjoy in Cape Town.  "

This is definitely a must for your bucket list, no doubt about it. And it is a must to CLIMB Table Mountain, and not take the easy way and use the cable car.There are quite a few trails to climb Table Mountain. The most well-known route is Plattekloof Gorge, which is basically just a huge amount of huge steps going zig-zag up the mountain, very steep! It is really taxing on your body and you keep wishing it to be over, but when you reach the top, you feel quite proud of yourself for making it. This route is free. It will take you about an hour to reach the top, or a bit more if you're not too fit.The other route I've used is Kasteelspoort trail. It is free, but very long. It's not as steep a climb as Plattekloof, actually, it's quite gradual. It's a great walk if you have the whole day, and you have amazing views over the Twelve Apostles. This is not too taxing on your body, but you have to have some endurance!The other route I've used is Skeleton Gorge. It sounds daunting, but it's not! (No one really knows where it gets its name!) This route starts in Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens (therefore you have to pay the entrance fee) and goes up a steep gorge to the back of Table Mountain. The climb is quite steep, but it is in a forest and therefore you're in the shade the whole time. You also go up next to a small river, and you can drink the clear water, which is great when you're tired! The climb is about 1 hour long, but if you want to get to the cableway station, you still need about 2 to 3 hours to cross the top of the mountain. But definitely worth it!Have a drink at the restaurant to reward yourself!"

Return cabs are easily available as they keep dropping people.Going Up the Mountain: Cableway tickets can be bought online (very easy) or from a queue. Cost 240R per head and the rate is halved if you go after 6 PM (check the timing for your season, its no always applicable). Timing and Up there on the Mountain: Its worthwhile to take the evening ticket as the best views are Sun Set views, however if you want to trek around, better go early (budget 2-3 hours minimum)Facilities on top: Restaurant, Souvenir Shop and Rest Rooms. All clean and very nice.And the great bonus - super photo views. Carry enough data cards/battery backups. Wear appropriate footwear as the trek terrain is wobbly.

Table Mountain National Park deserves a not-to-be missed tour when you visit Cape Town, South Africa.The views of the South African coast are breathtaking.I was very fortunate to have perfect weather when I reached the top of Table Mountain, Now, there are several ways to get there: if you are on an escorted tour, your time on the top is controlled to meet their schedule. You can take the city tour and be dropped off at the entrance and you can stay on top as long as you want; then hop on the next city bus to continue your visiting. Some of my friends opted to take a taxi directly from the hotel. I believed it costed 200 Rands each way. If you are energetic, you can climb to the top, which will take anywhere from 1 to 4 hours depending on the trail you select and your physical fitness. Make sure you buy a ticket to get back down the mountain. There are several ways to get a ticket for the Table Mountain Cableway .I recommend buying your ticket online because you get a better exchange rate in the US. Next the hotel concierge will help you to get a ticket the day before you want to go. Please check the weather forecast before you buy. If it is windy, it is too dangerous to be hanging in a cable car that rotates 360 degrees. I don't recommend standing inline at the cableway ticket office. If you are going to Robben Island, buy your ticket online."

I was very worried as I have a fear of heights but it was not too bad at all. No good trying to look away tough as the cable car turns a full 360 degrees on the journey. Once up there the views are fantastic we were lucky it was very clear and we could easily see right down to the Cape. There is a restaurant but like most our motorway eateries the food was cold by the time you have queued and paid for it. The beer is good though."

Certainly one of the things visitors to Cape Town must do.- watch the weather : cloudy means visibility poor (and that's a large part of why you go there)- watch the weather : the \"table cloth\" of cloud pouring over the mountain top means wind, so choose another day. Early morning gives you the best chance to beat the wind. Ask a local, they know the weather. Equally, if the weather is really bad, the cable car does not operate.- take a sun hat, sun screen and a warm top (just in case). All can be purchased at the top but the prices are a bit steep.- You can buy tickets on-line so as to cut down on queuing. Queuing up there is not too bad as the cable car runs quickly.- parking can be a challenge, so be prepared for a short walk.- if you only want a gentle stroll at the top, it is well laid out and even wheel-chair friendly. for a more challenging outing, Take your walking shoes and water, and strike out on one of the longer paths.- food and drink can be purchased at the top. The restaurant is well stocked.- be mindful of opening and closing times. You do not want to be stranded up there.- a night trip is special- ZAR 240 return or ZAR 100 for pensioners on a Friday ( as at 04 Dec 2015)- cameras and binoculars of course ! - the views are spectacularThis is only referring to the Table Mountain portion of the Park - there is lots more for the nature-hungry.I'm a Cape Townian and am certainly biased, but whatever........"

It's easily accessible by the tourist bus which stops at the cable car station or by taxi from the city. Keep an eye on the weather as the sun doesn't always shine and when it does the winds can pick up closing the cable car, so if the weather is good go for it and find something else to do when the clouds descend. I would also recommend getting your cable car tickets at the tourist bus stops (either by the V & A or on Long Street) as this will stop you having to cue up twice (once to by the tickets, once to ride the cable car) you'll still have to do it once though!Once at the top there are a number of self guided routes that will take you around the top from a short 10 mins to about an hour long route. There is also a restaurant and reasonably priced bar at the top to enjoy a beer while taking in the views."

I chose to do the Platteklip Gorge hike due to reviews that seemed like it was the quickest (2hours) and best signed route that one could do without a guide. And it was all those things. But I underestimated the physicality of the hike. We started out later than I would have liked so the sun was already blazing directly. There is limited shade on this route. The entrance to the hike is about 15 min walk from the cable car. From the base, it's up up up up. There are big rocks and so while it is not scary or too steep, it's a mostly vertical climb, and your thighs start to feel it in 10 mins or less. I consider myself to be in decent physical shape and it was tough. I saw plenty young men and women taking breaks and moving slowly through the hike. That said, even with feeling like I was moving like a tortoise, we got to the top in 1hr 45min, so it's definitely doable. The sense of achievement is great, and I felt like I earned my ride down the cable car (R125 one way). Plus the line to use the cableway at the base was ridiculously long, so I would like to think as people stood in line, I got acquainted with Table Mountains. I even have a scar from tripping on a rock to show for it :) also don't forget to admire the fyn bos (bushes) with protea and other types of plants. The view was worth the physical hike for sure! Tips:- a hat or visor is needed. The sun beats down like no mans business on a hot summer day. Water too obviously. I sweated so much that I got through my 700 ml in no time. Double that amount is recommended. There are restaurants at the top with water too. -Pace yourself and take breaks in the few shaded areas you find. - build in time to hang out at the top. The scenery is breathtaking, and there are so many view points. There are washrooms, restaurants, curio shops etc. Going up was worth it. Don't think I would put coming down in the same category. Plus the cableway deserved a visit to marvel at the engineering."

Superb lookouts, great walking paths, informative signage,etc, while resisting the temptation to be tacky purveyors to tourists ! Well done."

For the cable car make sure to check the Park's website, as it is often closed due to strong winds. Once up, you can have a nice walk (1,5 - 2 hours) around the National Park in order to hace a 365 degree view of the whole area. If you go up there for sunset, make sure to take a pullover with you even if in summer, as it can get quite chilly in the evening."

You can check this out on YouTube. We chose to go with a local guide which we arranged through Kingdom Tours. There were only 3 of us which made it very fun. I would recommend using a guide as the route is not always clear. The day we went was perfect, sunny with no wind and temperature in the high teens when we started. By the way the guide picked us up at 6am. I know it sounds early but go with it as the climb is fairly strenuous and in the sun. The day heats up fairly quickly. It took us about 3 hours to get to the top and then we rode the cable car down. If you are up for a longer adventure (4.5 to 5 hours) you can also go up from Kirstenbosch Gardens. Check with a guide on this option."

At the top Cape Town is laid out before you, and as you walk around on flat walkways, the views just get more awesome of the mountains and the coastline and you loss all track of time. Take lunch with you, cafe not great. Buy tickets online to avoid queuing to much."

We go pretty briskly, and did it in 1 hr 20 mins.Some great views back over Cape Town on the way up, but the real spectacular sights were from the plateaued summit. In addition to the views in all directions, the vegetation was amazing - very wet on the top and the whole surface is populated with beautiful flowering plants.It takes about another 15 mins from the top of the gully to follow the Smuts trail to the beacon & the highest point on the top; then it's about another 25 mins back to the Cable Car for the descent. Some of the best views are here, down on to Camps Bay and out to Signal Hill & the Lions Head. A great trip."

For the dare Devils you can abseil for a fee and there are enough platforms for you to take floating infinity pics. And if you aren't afraid of heights u can sit at the edge of a rock. My health & safety eyes went nuts when I saw all these crazy people stepping off the path to take pictures....there aren't any guides policing people & you have to be extremely careful if you step off the laid out paths.note that you can go around by yourselves or wait for the free hourly guided tours ....

My wife and I had been told by several people that if we wanted to walk one way it is best to walk up Table Mountain and get the views from the cable car on the way down. This was probably very good advice but, both aged 61 and in reasonably good health, and even though we are both good walkers, we found the 800 metre climb very strenuous, taking us 2 hours 40 minutes, even with several stops along the way to rest and admire the views.We were advised that one of the easiest walks was up Platteklip gorge, which is situated about 1.5 kms beyond the cable car. If this was the easiest I wouldn't have liked to have tackled the more difficult ones!Once at the top the views are, quite literally, out of this world. An amazing panorama of Signal Hill, Robben Island, Cape Town and the coastline for miles around. Don't forget to wear something warm though, as it is surprisingly chilly at the top.The trip back down in the revolving cable car took us 4 minutes and again afforded great views."

The edifice was huge and hulking and we could have spent many more hours exploring if the fog hadnt rolled in and we were walking in a heavenly mist. The tram turned as it ascended providing great views for all who were lucky enough to get a great day...as if there is too much wind or clouds the tram doesnt operate. It was a five minute drive from our hotel to the parking lot and we purchased our tickets online which saved a lot of waiting time. It feels like no place else on earth because the vegetation is so different as is the formation of the mountain itself."

It's a bit touristy, but there's a reason for that. It's beautiful on the way up to the top and just as stunning at the top! Once you reach the top of table mountain, head to the far left, where there will be slightly less people and if you're lucky, have some peace and quiet to really take in the view.

When taking this track, you walk steep uphill to the Contour Track, then turn left and walk more or less even (pass under the cable car) until you see the sign \"Platteklip Gorge\". Can't miss it as many others are coming up there. The first part on Contour Track we were by ourselves. It is pretty steep all the way with many big steps and requires a bit of fitness and determination...but it is rewarding! Take your time, breathe and enjoy the view. It took from Kloof Corner to the top of Platteklip Gorge 2 hours, slowly but continuously without stopping. Felt very satisfied once top! It is an icon and rightly so!"

            "review": "Extraordinary Views. Nothing screams Cape Town more than Table Mountain. Even while still on the airplane before landing at Cape Town International Airport, I was already craning my neck to catch a glimpse of this South African icon. And boy, did it live up to its' hype once we set foot on its flat top.As a cautionary word to would be explorers of this attraction, this is by far the most weather dependent venue that you would visit in Cape Town. When the winds pick up, the cable car shuts down, effectively preventing one from going to the top unless you want to hike, which is an exercise of fitness and endurance considering the altitude and terrain. At over 3,000 feet above sea level, it offers views that are only paralleled by a helicopter tour of the area. We were very lucky that it was open on our very first try. By the way, I strongly advise purchasing your tickets online way ahead of time as it is valid to be used anytime within a 7 day period from your chosen date. The lines were very long but it was moving at a moderate speed. The cable car ride to the top was swift and offered a 360 degree view on the way up as the floor was revolving.Once on top, the views were nothing short of spectacular. We kept finding angles to take pictures that offered views that were better than the one before. There are multiple hiking paths to take that gives one an opportunity to gasp at the sheer panoramic beauty and unnerving cliff drops (just be careful as there are no guardrails on the edges to stop you from falling should you slip). After spending close to two hours exploring, we decided to slip into the restaurant for lunch. Unless you bring your own lunch, you have no option but to eat at the restaurant which serves pretty decent food.Lastly, DO NOT forget to lather on the sunscreen. I made the mistake of enjoying the cool breeze up there (bring a sweater as it can get rather cold) the entire time and I paid the price after. So go ahead, snap a gazillion pictures and enjoy it. You'll remember the scenery in your head for a long long time. It's absolutely worth flying such a long distance for."

Be sure to check the weather forecast beforehand and ensure favourable conditions, dress accordingly (appropriate layers of proper hiking gear, sunglasses and sunblock) and don't forget to bring enough water and some energy bars in your backpack.Lastly...a good camera or action camera to witness the event is highly recommended!"

Many people passed us going down, but honestly that would have scared me more. Most of the hike is on rocks crawling up or down them. I was happy to go up so I didn't see how far I could fall. We arrived to the top just in time for the last ride down at 6pm. It was beautiful to see the sun setting and the lights coming on in the city below. Over 4,000ft of elevation gain so bring a jacket because it will be chilly at the top! Such a gorgeous view and a must do if it's clear. If you're looking for a great workout hike up to the top.

It provides a fantastic view of the whole city. The cable car looks like it goes straight up when you see it from the base of the mountain, but the trip up was fast and smooth. The gondola rotates 360 degrees as it moves which gives you a view of everything without having to move. At the top they have a pretty good restaurant where you can get a hot meal or a snack, as well as a gift shop. Just two tips I would give: Leave early to avoid having to wait in line. Sometimes the wait can be up to two hours once the tour busses show up. Check the weather as the cable car will not run if the top of the mountain is fogged in or it is very windy."

The line was super short (like 10 people) and they by passed the long 2 hour line! We left the a area, found Wi-Fi, logged onto the Table Mountain website, bought our tickets and went to a Pick and Pay to get them printed out as there is no option to send them to your phone. Super easy. We went back after lunch and the regular line was still a 2 hour wait. With our on-line tickets in hand, we by passed the line to purchase tickets and immediately got in line for the tram.

The view is stunning and the walk on the top give you wonderful view of the city and surrounding. We did not hike up because of some negative warnings from forum but should have done it ! At the top we met a lot of people hiking up from the gorge ( the trail starts a few kilometer further from the base where you take the cable car ) . The hike takes about 1h1/2 and there is no security issue as long as you start in the morning to be up by noon and in a beautiful day there are always a lot of people. The cable car is also very nice with stunning views . Give yourself a lot of time because the line might be long for the cable car .Definitely one must do when visiting Capetown !"

As we were there at the start of spring it was touch and go whether we would be able to even get to experience Table Mountain - the first day it was too windy to go up, and days 2 and 3 it was too cloudy. Luckily on our last day in Cape Town the cloud lifted and we were able to go up. We got on a City Sightseeing bus which, as well as giving us a good little tour of the Cape, took us right up to the entrance. As we were there out of season we were lucky in that we didn't have to queue for the cable car and within 5 minutes of arriving we were travelling up to the top! It's hard to put into words just how amazing this experience was - the views are spectacular. Once you are at the top you can go wandering off and you are able to take some magnificent photos. I can imagine in high season this could get very busy but when we were there we were able to experience all the views with very little interruption. Words can't do Table Mountain justice, you really do have to experience it yourself."

It's an experience I'm very pleased I've had.The views from the top are incredible. We picked the day the weather forecast as clearest and we got it right. We could see all down the Cape as well as over Cape Town and north/inland. Just beautiful. There's a restaurant and gift shop at the top. Decent food, definitely needed and deserved after the climb. We bought our cable car tickets down in the gift shop avoiding the long queues at the bottom. A great morning trip!We got a taxi from our Cape Town hotel having dropped our hire car off when arriving in the capital and I'm glad we did. Cars were parked all up the road to the lower cable car stop and we'd have added a good 30 mins onto the hike if we'd driven. The taxi cost around 100 Rand each way and dropped us right at the start of the Gorge track. The queue for tickets was long when we got back down around 1pm. Definitely recommend buying on line!"

The weather changes so quickly in Cape Town, that it can be sunny one minute, and completely cloudy the next. It would be a shame to hike it and meet clouds at the top. But if you're lucky, you'll be greeted by great views.We went in blindly, and didn't realize there were so many ways to the top. It wasn't always clear where we were going when the trail forked, but luckily a few walkers guided us back in the right direction. We ended up on the path with stone steps. It can be quite steep at times, and it is NOT an easy hike. I'm not saying it's an all day hike. But some sections can be pretty vertical. It was much more difficult than we anticipated. But even still, I think it only took us 90 minutes. The views at the top are very nice. We had a mix of clouds/sun, so it was a mixed bag for us. I can imagine it's quite stunning on a sunny day. We elected to take the cable car down. Going down those steep steps would have been rough on the knees. If you're in shape and want a nice workout, I'd recommend hiking it. If you're not up for a good hike, take the cable car."

The cable car ride up is worth the price, and if at all possible pick your day for perfect weather as the views are wonderful. Wandering the paths at the top is easy and relaxed, and enjoying a bite to eat or a beverage is delightful in the sunshine, or if you are lucky as the clouds roll in and the breeze drifts the mist over the edge of the table!

Having climbed the mountain years ago, my husband and I wanted to share the experience and thrill with eight of our closest friends, all of whom are in their 50s and very fit. With the help of good friends who live in Cape Town, we selected the fastest, 2-hour route, Plettenberg Gorge, a 4.3 mile climb (as in a steep, stair-like climb) and 2,348 foot ascent. It was grueling in spots and required a razor-like focus. Turning around made some dizzy. I'm truly thankful that we took what was touted as the \"easy route\" because anything else would have required skills we did not possess, even if we had had a guide. If you plan to go, the Plettenberg Gorge is a great and safe route. Hiking up from Kirstenbosch Gardens is also safe, far less arduous although the trail to the top takes five hours and includes rope ladders and a few steep runs. Anything else on Table Mountain requires a guide!"

There are two cars that move quite quickly and rotate as they ascend allowing for great views to be had by all. Definitely recommend booking your ticket online in advance, I believe you book either a morning or afternoon session and the ticket is valid for 7 days. This is useful as on days when there is poor weather or visibility the cable car may close, I believe you are free to walk up and down on any day but looks like a demanding ascent that I wouldn't attempt. We went about 9:30am and there were already long queues forming to purchase tickets which we could skip. We were actually above the light clouds on the day we visited which added to the brilliant views. It is well worth a trip up!"

The initial queue was about 30mins but this was helped by buying our tickets from the hop on hop off red bus which drops you right outside the mountain so no queuing to but tickets which can add another hour of waiting.

On arriving by car we were waved at by men at side of road wanting us to use their places we presumed for some can of tip if it is still there when we came back but we continued and found a spot much nearer. The queue was very long but we went online using the free wifi and bought tickets which enabled us to go right to the front of the queue, jumping past a good 500 people. Then a bit more queuing for the cable car itself but not too long as the 2 cars can carry 800 people per hour. Nice touch that the cars revolve whilst in motion so that everyone gets a good view up and down the mountain. Stunning views from the top and good facilities, the cafe was certainly not overpriced. On arriving back at the bottom the photo that was taken of you on the way up has been processed into a very slick package and again not overpriced. It would have been interesting to find out what the entry money is being spent on as they will have very low outlay. It is just a mountain, but certainly one to say you've been to the top off."

The views from the top are simply phenomenal - if you can't manage the hike definitely take the cable car. If you can do the hike - it's worth the hard slog for the views trust me!

It took us about 1h40m with a six year old, so we weren't going very fast. And it's a magical way to experience the mountain. Always take something warm as the wind can be cold on top and weather changes fast, this applies whether you climb of cable car up!There's lots of space to explore on top, you could take a picnic and make a day of it, or plan a 3hour round trip if your time is limited.There were no queues for the quick cable car ride down which was well earned."

Wind will make the cable ca ride in the cable car a frightening experience , it is extremely steep climb, not for the faint hearted. Fog can roll in with out warning and shroud the mountain thus obscuring the view. Great little restaurant at the top for a snack/coffee. Don't forget to take a jacket . There's a lot to see once up top if you have the time"

Go when it first opens to avoid long ques. Go as soon as you can because if the winds are high the cable car ride will be closed. Tours at the top are 1 hour and guides are available. There are also a cafe and shop at the top. Allow 1-2 hours when at the top. Wear tennis shoes or hiking boots and dress warm with layers since it is cool especially i the morning. There are many taxis in the que so it is easy to get a return ride when you are ready to leave. I took the City Sightseeing Bus (aka hop on and off) to return to the V&A Waterfront when done. Enjoy!"

You should also continue over the chain handrails to the central table. There you have an easy 1.5 hour route to Maclear's Beacon. Many seemed to walk the Platteklip Gorge, it seemed to be a bit steap so some condition required. Most people were with no guides. The Sceleton Gorge starts with well built wooden steps from the National Botanical Garden. Lovely views, don't know how the route ends as we didn't have time to walk up all the way.TIP: Buy the tickets in advance from internet. There may be a long queue for tickets at the station. The ticket is valid 7 days from the day you take. You need to select if you wish to go before or after 13.00.TIP: Check from Windguru if there is over 20 knots wind in Cape, the cable car often shuts down on heavier wind.

There's also a restaurant/fast food place to get refreshments but we didn't eat there so I can't comment. The toilets were a bit yuk but guess that's to be expected. The views are simply magical.

The views are amazing, of course, and there are some nice walks, so wear your best walking shoes. Bring binoculars if you wish, but just OBSERVE. Be on the lookout for small animals, like rock hyraxes, lizards, and colorful birds. There are refreshments, souvenirs (nice-quality ones) and restrooms at the top.

The trail is ok to walk but be sure you know your way arround on a bit more difficult hicking trails. Sometimes it can be steep and the path is uneven as you walk on big and small rocks. The view from the top is breathtaking. Make sure to bring enough water as it can be hot during the day. Start hicking early and descent before the sun is at it's hottest. We visited on a weekend and the waiting line to get into areal tram was very long. We found a parking spot a bit further then the trailhead as the road towards it was very crowded and packed with cars and busses. If you are fit and like to hike on moutain paths, this is the place to be."

We bought tickets on line although next am the venue was closed due to winds. The ticket is good for 14 days. The weather forcast said it would be clear between 12-1:00 so we set out later than expected and got up there right when it was perfectly clear. Amazing. Also the restaurant at the top was excellent! Pizza was fantastic and the candied pop corn!"

During my week in Cape Town, the cable car was closed because of windy conditions on two days, and the notorious \u2018tablecloth\u2019 cloud blanketed the mountain top for another two, On another day, a wildfire broke out on the northern slopes affecting the views. I had been aware of the first two risks so when I saw the clear conditions with little wind on my first day, I was at the top of Table Mountain within a few hours of touching down. Table Mountain had been on my bucket list for too long and it is everything I had hoped and much more. I spent several hours at the top walking round and enjoying the panoramic views. Just before going down in the cable car, I went to the caf\u00e9 and sat down with a beer when the tablecloth started to form and the air turned decidedly cooler and damper. Luckily I had been aware of this risk as well and had a warm jacket, scarf and gloves with me. There is generally no need to book in advance and the cable car is easily reached by the hop-on-hop-off buses with a stop right at the cable car entry."

The views at the top and all the way up are utterly breathtaking and make the physical exertion of the trip worth it! Don't take this mountain lightly by any means and bring ample amounts of water. Far, far better to do the walk on a clear day as when there are clouds resting on the top of the mountain the views are severely limited.

The views are unparalleled anywhere else in the world and there are even cute little dassies (rock hyraxes) by the top cable station.

We spent 4 days in Cape Town as part of our honeymoon and Table Mountain was an absolute must, and then learned that the cable car was off for annual maintenance so the only way up was to walk. We had booked the Platteklips Gorge route up, however when we were picked up our guide asked if we wanted to go a different route, he said that it would involve 'scrambling over some rocks'..... didn't sound too difficult at the time. I'm not sure whether scrambling is a hiking term but it sure didn't end up being what I thought it was. We ended up going up a route called India Venster, which at certain points had metal bars sticking out the mountain face to use like ladders with metal chains attached at the top of ledges for you to pull yourself up on, some parts didn't even have these metal supports and found ourselves rock climbing using crevices to pull ourselves up. I've never done any form of rock climbing or hiking so there were certainly some pretty hair raising moments, its quite easy to become scared of heights when you're hanging onto a ledge with no supports or helmets etc looking down to the city, and although it was difficult I'm so happy we did it this way. Me and the wife both had a great sense of achievement after getting to the top, and although I wouldn\u2019t have done this route as a choice if I originally knew what it would entail, I know wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way. We only saw 6 other people on this route up, when we went down the Platteklips Gorge way we saw hundreds. Not for the faint hearted but a great feeling afterwards and unforgettable views along the way."

There are very friendly rock dussies at the top too, which is a cool little attraction in itself.

The cable cars hold about 60 people each and revolve, so you will have great views all the way up. A tip for those with a flexible itinerary - if you can see the top of the mountain, head straight there - don't delay until tomorrow or even later that day - because once the 'tablecloth' arrives, it could be days before the cloudy cover disappears and you will have missed your opportunity altogether. Keep an eye out for a cute little dassie (rock hyrax) in the rocky outcrops."

I normally climb up the mountain in order to feel more connected to nature but you could also take the cable car up. If the weather is nice climb it. That is if you are physically capable of climbing up stairs. There is different routes that can be taken. The skeleton gorge is really nice and takes about 3 hours to climb to the very top of the mountain.You can buy a one way ticket for the cable car at the top if you don't feel like walking all the way down. The average time for climbing down is about 1h30. It puts quite a lot of strain on you knees though. Make sure you wear proper trainers as sneakers will cause problems for your feet afterwards."

We got the opportunity of visiting Table Mountain as part of a city tour that we did of Cape Town, and the experience was breathtaking.The mountain provides a dramatic backdrop to the cityscape, and invites you in with its unusual form (being flat at the top - hence its name) ... providing Cape Town with a degree of protection from the elements means that different rainfall amounts are dumped on either side of the mountain, creating different habitats. All of this is visible from the top of the mountain.The national park has very thoughtfully built many viewing platforms that really allow you to take in the various views of the dramatic landscape - I found it to be incredibly beautiful. And in addition to the views, there is a quite a bit of local fauna to view when you're at the peak ... plenty of birds about, and the charming Dassie is always easily found.We spent about an hour at the peak and really loved it - for any visitor to Cape Town, a visit to the peak (or rather top) of Table Mountain is something that gives a wonderful introduction to the city of Cape Town and its surrounds.Note, while there was no fee for this attraction (or we didn't pay one), unless you are very fit and are prepared to spend a couple of hours climbing and descending, you'll need to catch the cable car ... and for that there is a fee."

We'd only been in Cape Town for a day and a half and were not due to visit Table Mountain until the following day before we departed for the airport at 16:00. With the sun shining and clouds gradually clearing we raced to Signal Hill to get some photo shots of both Table Mountain and the Twelve Apostles. Interestingly, no one we'd come across during our holiday, including the tour guide that took us on the Cape of Good Hope Tour and surrounding area, told us about Signal Hill which we found by pure chance whilst trying to navigate to the highest unobstructed view point in Cape Town, which was great for photo shots - well worth a 15 minute hike up the path to see some great views across Cape Town and Camps Bay. We realized at this point that the clouds had cleared sufficiently to attempt Table Mountain so we raced over to the Cable Car Station which took us less than 10 minutes. I'd previously booked tickets on-line in the UK for the following day (AM) but customer services were more than happy to refund my online ticket (via my original credit card) and let me re-book replacement tickets for that afternoon (BTW, my refund appeared on my credit card 3-4 days later virtually alongside the subsequent charge). I even got a better deal where my daughter traveled for free with a paying adult saving me over 100 Rand - now that's service with a smile! Once on top of Table Mountain I have to say that the experience of some clouds interspersed with bouts of sunshine was fantastic. The experience was awesome with the temperature dropping about 12 degrees, the wind howling and the clouds intermittently coming and going making for a real eerie experience. In between, I got some great shots of Cape Town and the Twelve Apostles/ Camps Bay. Everyone suggests going to Table Mountain when the sun is shining brightly and the sky cloudless however I think the experience we had was much more dramatic - my wife was scared to go near the edge for fear of being blown over but my daughter and I thought it was a right thrill! As we'd visited late in the afternoon on a mixed day during the last week of SA's winter tourists were minimal with zero waiting time and very few tourists on top of the Mountain allowing for an almost exclusive experience. My advice would be `don't necessarily plan for a perfect day, be flexibility, and let luck take its course' - you might have a ball! By the time we got to the bottom the horn was blowing instructing to leave the Mountain which only added to the experience in that we'd just managed to slot in this experience by the skin of our teeth; the following day was overcast and raining so we'd have lost out entirely had a bit of luck and ambition not been on our side :-)"

The rock formation itself with its unique flora and fauna makes for an interesting walk/hike. But the real deal is the ability to take in a 360 degree view from what truly feels like the top of the world. Make sure you have plenty of film in your camera. The rotating floor on the gondola gives everyone a great opportunity to see all angles as you head up the mountain. As one of the most popular tourist stops, make sure to go early. We arrived 15 minutes after it opened and still had to wait 40 minutes to get on the gondola. (By the time we came down the line was 3 times as long as when we had arrived.) Also, if you are visiting for several days, try to pick a day that is clear and not windy. We were lucky and had a spectacular cloudless and still morning, but we heard many stories of high winds making it less comfortable on other days."

There is a restaurant on top so you can refuel once you're there.If you park your car a little further along past the cable car, you'll be able to hike the Plattekloof gorge to the top (steeper but faster) that way you can walk back to your car from the cable-car afterwards."

Our day started off with the potential of not being able to go to the top due to the weather/clouds, but it luckily cleared up and we were allowed to go up. We had gorgeous views at the top and it wasn't too crowded to take pictures and enjoy where we were. This is considered a new wonder of the world and I think it's definitely a site worth seeing. It's best to buy a ticket in advance (make sure that you have a window to use it in case the day you want does not allow trips to the top). Otherwise you may be waiting in line for a while."

So many residents enjoy the mountain every day, hiking, trail running, mountain biking, bird-watching, exploring the botanical splendour and more. It really is a worthwhile trip providing views of not only Robben Island, the City Bowl but an endless horizon to Fasle Bay as well as the distant Paarlberg and more. A truly exceptional panoramic perspective, that is evocative and well-worth the Cable car trip, or a decent hike up the mountain trails. The Mountain is also covered in unique Fynbos and a myriad of interesting flowering plants that are representative of the biodiversity of the region. Lots of endemic birds occur at the top, from Cape Sugarbird, through to Orange-breasted Sunbirds, Cape Siskin and in terms of mammals the ever ubiquitous Rock Hyrax. An incredible trip that I undertake several times a year, in all seasons.There are multiple entry points and activity areas, from the Table Mountain Cable Way, through to the Silvermine Nature Reserve, Tokai State Forest, Newlands State Forest, Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden and much more. All dependent on the activities you would like to undertake.Its worth walking along some of the top paths and trails, which will lead you to other view points that are also just as truly majestic as the main city view."

It doesn't take very long to get down. Our hotel had got us the tickets on line which made a big difference. You should wait until there is a clear day before you go up. The hikes up the mountain looked good but you need enough time to do them."

The Table Mountain National Park is much more than a Mountain with a flat top; it stretches all the way from Table Mountain in the city center, to Cape Point at the tip of Africa. In between all sorts of amazing discoveries await: waterfalls, caves, forests, easy walks, more challenging walks, difficult climbs, reservoirs, botanical gardens, BBQ (braai!) facilities, cable cars, funiculars, light houses, flora and fauna. I regularly hike different parts of the mountain with a friend. It's a magical place and no two days are ever alike. Tips - this is a real, unpredictable mountain, so be sensible - warm jacket, water, map, cell phone, etc. Remember to tell someone where you'll be walking."

The views from the top are breathtaking and inspiring.Even with busloads of tourists being dropped off, the cable car system is very well organized so that you can get to the top relatively painlessly. There are two cars that hold about 50 people each so they are able to move the line along fairly well but also limit the crowd at the top.A couple of tips to make the experience easier:1. Buy your tickets in advance.2. Monitor the website, updated at 8 am.3. Get there early to lessen the crowds.4. Have breakfast up top. Great cafe.5. Enjoy the incredible scenery."

We were ill advised by staff that it was a 40 min queue to get up which turned out to be 2.5 hrs and the queue back down was the same! It was very cold at the top as queue was not sheltered. Small children and older people looked really uncomfortable. Cafe looked good though but had closed even though they were still letting people go up after 6pm.

But if you plan on hiking the mountain, be warned that it is a technical climb that will take most people around 2 hours to make one direction. About 4,000 feet up what amounts to stairs. Platteklip Gorge is the main hike up and there are a lot of people on the trail. All total I spend 5-1/2 hours hiking up and down the trail.Wear sturdy hiking boots if you decide to go. I saw lots of people in running shoes (a few actually running the trail) some in flip flops and at least one guy bare foot. But I was very happy to have worn sturdy hiking boots, especially on the climb down. Also bring a minimal of 2 liters of water, more if hot.There is a cable car that can take you one way if you only want to hike part but be warned, it can stop running with no warning so if you go to the top, even in the cable car, you need to be prepared to hike down. Or at least make sure you go on a day the weather is stable. Something I don't think happens much during the winter in Cape Town. The cable cars were not running for annual maintenance the day I was there. The cable cars I believe cost something but since they were not running I don't know how much.Views from the top are awesome and make sure you leave yourself at least one hour. You can seen in all directions and there are trails at the top that you can check out. Sunset would also be fantastic from here but make sure the cars are running as you don't want to hike down in the dark, it is hard enough in the light.There are cabs usually parked at the bottom of the hiking trail and cable car lodge so if you need a ride back into the city it should not be difficult to get one."

I say it's like being on the stairmaster for 1.5 hours...depending on your pace. We really didn't stop except for a few seconds here and there. But it was well worth it. Took the cable car down. Can take it up as well. Wind will close the cable car so be aware and check before you go. The cable car is also closed for a period every winter to do maintenance so check for operating times. Other than that...GO!"

            "review": "Up the mountain. The cause of Cape Town's traffic problems is that there is a massive mountain in the way. Every day thousands of Capetonians have to navigate their way around it on their way to work or to arrive at their destinations. Yet so few of them ever experience the awesome wonder of the mountain and its national park.The National Park is vast and stretches across many Cape Town suburbs. The main focal points are the 3 summits of Table Mountain, Devil's Peak and Lions Head. There are many gentle walks around the foothills of the mountain on all sides of it. Newlands forest is popular for dog walkers and evening strolls.If, like me, you would like to attain a summit when setting out to walk on the mountain, the easiest of these is Lion's Head. Fit people can get from the car park to the top in 45mins to an hour. Unfit: 2hrs max. The final push is quite a rigorous step for step climb up table-height rocks.Devil's Peak is more challenging. The simplest way is from near the end of Tafelberg Road (the one with the cable station), up the Saddle and then onto the peak. Stick to the paths. It's steep. Allow 2 and a half hours. To summit Table Mountain, it can be approached from any and every side and with huge ranges in difficulty. The simplest way up is Platteklip Gorge which is the big dividing line on the front of Table mountain. Steep. Usually 2 to 3 hours. (Fit people can summit quicker than those in the cable car queue during tourist season!) You'll see the starting point on Tafelberg Road just beyond the cable station. Also very popular is Skeleton Gorge which starts at KIrstenbosch Botanical Garden (you will have to pay entry to the gardens if you start there (but can enter the gardens freely if you descend there from the mountain)).My favourite is to start right at the back of the mountain at Constantia Nek. From the car park there you can effectively be on top of the mountain (but the back end of it - not the popular part) in well under an hour. How far you want to explore on top of the mountain is up to you. It's vast. You can visit the 5 dams, look down on Kirstenbosch, follow the circular route on top, there's even a museum up there or you can cover the whole top plateau by walking across to the cable station at the opposite end of the mountain from Constantia (that would take about 5 hours). I also like this particular area because it is free from crowds and is often populated with friendly local hikers who love the mountain and will chat about interesting things they have seen or warn about impending weather etc. It's quite clever the way the cable car operates on a tiny edge of a massive national park - so as to leave vast areas of beauty completely untouched.After about 20 minutes of walking the views in all directions are spectacular. At the top there are places where the traffic noise disappears and it is difficult to believe one is still in a metropolitan area. WARNINGS: You'll need to have a good idea of direction and where you are going. Look at and take a map.  You'll need to take warm clothes and be ready for sudden weather changes. The weather on the mountain is not the same as in the city below and can change quickly. The Cable Station closes when they are unhappy about weather or wind speed. A hooter blows, but I have only ever heard it from the tourist area near the station, so always be ready to have to walk down if you plan to explore the National Park beyond the Table. Take water and something to eat. Know who you will phone if you get into trouble. Don't go alone. There is some crime on the Devil's Peak slopes. The mountain claims lives each year. It looks easier than it is."

The cable car up to the top of the mountain is marvelous. And the views just keep on getting better and better. The mountain is close to the city, so just a 2 hour time slot can help you get this thing done. If you have more time, you can explore more of the area at the top. The view of the bay & the city from the top are great. You also get a good view of the Lion's Head & Signal Hill."

Drink it when you need it! You can buy more at the cafe/restaurant at the Cable Car Station at the top.Take your time, when you're struggling take time to stop, drink water, look around and absorb the views! Take photos and enjoy it!

Table Mountain is literally that; a huge-flat topped mountain ranging behind the City of Cape Town. The reason it could take so long is the fact that due to an air inversion, clouds coming off of the ocean can obscure the mountain top like a \"table cloth.\" In addition, it can get quite windy in which case, the cable cars needed for assent do not run. If you have the opportunity however, do not miss it. You can see all the way to Cape Point to the West, Robben Island (where Mandela was held prisoner for 27 years) and the towns across False Bay to the South and the mountain range as it heads in an Easterly direction. This is an attraction tha cannot be missed."

It's basically a giant stone staircase that starts to feel endless! It was quite challenging but definitely worth it when I got to the top! If you are a fit person, taking a trail up the mountain is rewarding, but be prepared - it is very steep, even on Skeleton Gorge or one of the alternate routes. My second time, I took the cable car up, and that was much more pleasant. The cable car can close with little warning, so be prepared to hike down if you have to. The first time I hiked up, we met people returning who told us the car was closed for technical issues. Luckily by the time we made it, they had fixed it.

On the top it is a short walk to the cable car to get down again. Just do it EARLY or the sun will be your biggest enemy.Alternative routes are found from the other side of the mountain. A polular and nice one is the Skeleton Gorge which starts in Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens. Skeleton is not as easy as Platteklip."

A great workout if you're hiking - just don't make the same mistakes i did---take a lot of water with you. best hiking times are early morning in summer, before the heat gets too much. while this option is free, it does cost more time.you can also opt to take the cable car, which is very nice, and allows for breathtaking views of cape town. there is a fee for use the cable car. you can also choose to take the cable car one direction - hike up, cable car down.either way, it's worth it!"

Every time I climbed out of my car and simply listened to the peace and looked at the views, it was truly a happy experience. It is always quiet and rewarding and looking up the craggy peaks that have watched and guarded the city for millions of years make me appreciate this 7th wonder of the world!"

The views from up on high are really splendid. Cape Town is blessed with so much mountain, and so many ways up and across this the backbone of the Peninsula, and all in such easy reach of the city and suburbia. Walks up are of varying degrees of easy to challenging : the tourist advertised routes are always safe, but any mountain experience takes effort and some hard graft. The splendid cableway will always take those who really are not fit enough to walk up.The best time to go walking/climbing is early, before the heat (preferably first light, to beat the traffic and the heat); but on a cool day, that's less important. Must haves:are strong shoes, a hat, water and extra warmth - the weather on Table Mountain can be quickly changeable. Stay on marked routes - and if you're not sure, ask.Capetonians are friendly and easy to chat to! But, if you're visiting Cape Town, and have time and energy - DO make time for our Table Mountain, with its unique floral eco systems. Best known tourist routes up are Skeleton Gorge (from Kirstenbosch), Platteklip (from the Cable Station), Constantia Nek and Kasteels Poort, from Camps Bay. Alao great walks in the Cape Point Reserve."

It looked like someone was slowly pulling a tablecloth over a table! Then it would start to move off just like a tablecloth coming off. It was very interesting. We will be back in October so I am hoping we have a day without cloud cover. It was very enjoyable to see. The cable car was closed due to the fog so I am hoping we can do that next time we visit."

If you drive along the coast, it is a scenic drive with its own beauty and when you get to the park, you get to experience wild life like Eland. the largest antelope in the world. You also find load of baboons that have perfected the art of stealing out of unlocked vehicles or out of your hand, be careful. Enjoy nature at it's best. Cape Point was previously believed to be where the Indian and Atlantic Oceans meet, but this is not true, they meet further east at Cape Aghulas. Walk up to the new lighthouse and look down on the old lighthouse that was built too low and did not serve to warn any ships and had to be rebuilt higher up on the peninsula. Enjoy breathtaking scenery all the way around. There is an entrance fee and if I remember correctly, foreigners pay more as locals. Check the SANPARK website for more details."

Take the Cable Car up Table Mountain and take in the most amazing sights of the Cape Peninsular before you enjoy a wonderful breakfast at the restaurant situated right at the top. From there you can choose one of the trails that run from there. The one we last chose in November was across Table Mountain to Breakfast Rock and down Nursery Ravine into Kirstenbosch Gardens. We went via the dam to get there.This is an amazing time of the year in Cape Town as it's well into late Spring/early Summer and most of the Flora is either blooming or about to. There's also the Cape Dassies and mountain lizards as well as other small creatures that are permanent inhabitants of this mountain.The kaleidoscope of vibrant colors is breathtaking and not to be missed and this is just on the mountain and not into Kirstenbosch Gardens yet.The Gardens when you get there has such a lot to offer and after a lovely lunch you can spend the rest of the afternoon exploring this amazing, international landmark.So if you've heard of Table Mountain, The Cable Car and Kirstenbosch and seen pics and travel brochures of them then you have to experience them because the pics and right-ups don't do them real justice as they are way better than anyone can describe.Who knows...... We might even bump into each other on your visit to them because I'm definitely going back and have been doing so since I was a Youngster."

Well done!And of course that view! As always, THE best views of any city anywhere!Remember, the Cable Car is but one route up. There are many different walks that lead to the top, and these offer spectacular vistas of urban, mountain, and ocean!Definitely recommended if you visit Cape Town! If you want to venture away from the top reaches, best walk with someone who knows the paths and is willing to lead you. Wear comfortable sturdy footwear and take water and warm clothing. Oh, and some snacks and of course a camera!Obviously for the Cable Car there is a fee, but it's completely free to walk!Recommended duration of visit? Well, for the area just around the cable station, maybe an hour or two. But if you plan to hike, that depends on where exactly, anything from 3 hours to a full day."

Facing the Table Bay Harbour and City Bowl - this is a popular trail that presents an awesome view whilst hiking up. Besides the view, the fauna and flora is absolutely pristine and fresh. Proteas' (South Africa's national flower) is in great abundance - with it's raw beauty and species of plant that is only indigenous to the Table Mountain environment. Then there's the mountain goat, perched up on ledges that are impossible to get to - but these animals found their way up there - fascinating! I was fortunate to see a pair of Dassie's on the mountain - but these are quite prolific - and have become used to humans entering into their environment. The trick is to take it slow and stop every 20 minutes to take in the scenery and surroundings. Don't just scoot to the top. There's no race :)In the summer months, the sun can get quite strong on your back whilst hiking up. I normally start the hike at 5am to beat the rays of the sun.Winter, is quite cool to cold. The hiking trail is quite slippery, hence be very cautious. The cool weather is the best time to hike up.Normal hike would take about 2hours - with stopping.Carry sufficient water and a power snack. . Wear clothing that you can take off and easily carry up.I hiked up alone, but I did see other groups/families enjoying the trip up."

The 2+ mile hike up was one of the toughest we have ever done, and that includes the Grand Canyon. Almost the entire hike was climbing large stone steps, in full sun. Of course, the views were wonderful on the way up. At the top we found hundred of people that had taken the cable car. There was a full service restaurant, and the views were 360 degrees. Magnificent. So, take your choice; foot or cable. But you must make the trip, when the clouds do not obstruct your view."

A most amazing view of Robin Island can be seen as you look towards Bloubergstrand beach and Cape Town\u2019s harbour along the west coast. Looking northerly one might be able to spot a plane coming into Cape Town International on short finals, which might be from False Bay/Muizenberg side or it might be turning in from Bloubergstrand and flying past Tygerburg Nature Reserve which is in-line with one of the runways. Looking in a northerly direction one would see the mountain range out at Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, and Paarl; if you take some time and look through one of the many viewers that surround the Cable car building you would see the vineyards that scour the base of the Hottentos-Holland Mountain range."

There is lots of wildlife (like the hyraxes) and birds to see PLUS all the views of the surrounding area.We did a 6 mile hike and parts were a little strenuous but it is all clearly marked and really fun to do. They offer rappelling down a part of it and for the intrepid hikers, you can hike both up and down the mountain. It is not for the feint of heart. The weather is variable so keep that in mind. You do not want to get stuck hiking down if the fog rolls in."

Determined me and my friends decided to make our way up anyway and see how things were when we got there. Went to buy our tickets and the guy at the window told us the same conditions, but we decided to go up anyway because if you're in Cape Town you can't not go up Table Mountain. Got up and it was covered in cloud, no visibility (but actually not cold, then again we're Canadian) and I swear 7 people in the entire place. We walked around for a while and it was magically quiet, the loudest, heaviest silence I have ever experiences it almost made me cry. Anyway all of a sudden the clouds parted and the view of Cape Town that everyone looks for on Table Mountain appeared, and not a soul was around to see it. Despite the 'bad' conditions we had a fantastic time, and I would advise people not to be discouraged- the clouds do move and you will be rewarded!! Absolutely must see and a fantastic place to be, nothing beats sitting on a mountain that's 155 million years old and connecting with the surroundings in the clouds."

You have to be careful with the weather in Cape Town, as it can be tricky with the fog. It is always recommended to go up as soon as there is a clear day because you never know when it's going to get foggy, and once foggy you can get up there but you won't be able to see anything. You can hike up, which was done by a few tourists, but mostly locals do that. You can drive or take the bus all the way to the base, and from there hop into the cable car up. It can take a while to make the line, as everybody wants to go up whenever the day is clear. The cable car is great because it's gyratory, so you can appreciate the complete view on the way up. Once you are in the to the view is amazing! Great photo opportunities. There is a restaurant on site and bathrooms available. It can be pretty windy, so prepare accordingly. Also try to go in comfortable shoes if you plan to walk around the area, it is a little rocky."

(we actually visited in January 2914). This was, without doubt, one of THE best experiences I have ever had. As you ascended to the top of the mountain, you were able to get a 360 degree view as the cable car slowly rotates ensuring everyone gets the best view as one ascends & descends. As a wheelchair user, I would advise you take it steady and have a good cushion with you but the view is spectacular and the history is dotted around as you traverse the table top. Wonderful nature, flora and fauna abound and a great cafeteria and gift shop with it's own post box are there too. You CANNOT visit Cape Town without going here! Further advise: if you are a wheelchair user, be sure to check all your nuts and bolts after this trip for almost all mine had shaken loose. Thanks to a garage with a motorcycle shop attached in Cape Town, we were able to borrow the necessary spammers to tighten everything back up again."

We started at Kirstenbosch Garden, bought a map (R 5) and asked at the information to highlight the trail. Take enough water with you (2 litre or more), snacks, jacket, sport/hiking shoes, camera and sun protection. The first part is with steps trough the forest, then 3 ladders and after a part with rocks trough a stream. After that is passed, the last section is completly in the sun. Really amazing hike! Beautiful view and a variety of nature. Not that dangerous and hard than I thought before (heard a lot). Just make sure that you take your time and do breaks in between. Takes about 4-5 h to the cable car with small breaks and not running up. You should be a little sporty, but you don't need to be athlete :-)"

I like to go up Devils Peak, which in spite of its name, is a fairly manageable walk for those strong in the leg and with a respect for heights.The flowers and birds are beautiful and the city and seascapes once you are up there, are truly amazing. One can spend an hour whilst eating your lunch sandwich and soaking up the sunlight gazing at the kaleidoscope of mountain urban and seascapes. Just stunning! The steps going down again take a toll on the knees but take it slow and you will be well satisfied with a good day out on the most unique mountain in the world!"

Table mountain dominated the skyline around Cape town and be aware inclemant weather can soon shut the cable cars, so if your visiting and its fine go to the mountain. We had a great sunny day when we visited, being Winter there were no queues for the cars and at the top it was relatively quiet. The views are stunning and the walks around the top are very good with paths laid out, although they are uneven in places. There are designated walks at the top although we found following them was not straightforward , but that may just be us as we do like to wander. We were given a map of the walks and this gave us a good idea of which path to follow. There did seem to be more paths than those shown on the map.There were a lot of information boards around the walls and on the walks which gave some very interesting information and history. I would say the trip was worthwhile , the views were worth it alone."

Three things to consider before you go up to the top on the cable car: 1) Buy your ticket online and save time not having to wait in line, 2) Consider taking the Hop On-Hop Off bus to get to the cable car and not worry about parking your car a long way up the road, 3) Check the weather before you go. If it's clear and there are only a few clouds-GO. The weather can change very quickly and you could end up in the clouds with no view. The trails at the top are worth exploring and can take an hour + to experience."

The best part of going to Table Mountain with 3 children and a teenager was being able to book online in advance which ensured that we avoided the queues on the day. We went up at 8:30am which was also another great way to ensure that we had no more than a 5 minute wait to board the cable car.It is a slick tourist operation with a great and very comfortable ride up in a rotating cable car which ensures that everyone gets a great view.Once up the mountain, there are lots of good signs to ensure that people may move about and get to see the views of Cape Town, Robben Island etc.We ate at the Restaurant on top which is a self service typical tourist type restaurant. There was a good selection but it does feel like a diner type experience. I miss the old restaurant on top, which has now been turned into the main tourist shop selling the usual t-shirts, postcards, soft toys etc.The kids loved running around and all of us really enjoyed the experience. I \"must do\" when visiting Cape Town."

In any case, you MUST go up and see the city from above. There is no better view than this one! It's best to go on a clear day and wait until sunset (the last cable car goes down at 6pm). Up on top you can walk the 1h walk along the flat or take a bit longer and hike up and down after it. Both walks are stunning! Make sure you get a map from the tourist information at the intersection in Kloof Nek (you can take the bus here). If you want to just enjoy a coffee and cake on top, there is a small cafe."

The only downside was the two-hour wait for the cable car: because of \"load shedding\" electrical outages they were using their own generator which only provides enough electricity to run half loads. At least most of the wait was under shade from the sun. This was our third try at seeing Table Mountain and the first successful with previous clouds and winds making it impossible. If you are in Cape Town, do this on the first good weather day you have--it may be your only chance."

Living at the base of Table Mountain for 2 years we were fortunate enough to explore this beautiful mountain and park extensively. To plan a day trip through the park I would suggest looking at a map and choosing one of the 4 \"sides\" to start from. The hikes and walks from the front (the city side) are pretty strenuous but one that stands out is the hike up to Devil's Peal, a really extraordinary exploration with breathtaking views of the city, the bay and Table Mountain. The Camps Bay side, has a handful of steep hikes with India Venster being the most popular, but also the most challenging. The hikes from Hout Bay are more gradual but just as beautiful, the Constantia neck hike is one that stands out with the Elephant's Eye cave being the highlight, a hidden gem. Last but not last, the Kirstenbosch/Claremont side of the mountain boasts the infamous skeleton gorge hike starting in Kirstenbosch Gardens. A truly spectacular hike that will allow you to take in the beautiful flora of the Gardens and enjoy the most amazing sunrise Cape Town has to offer."

The mountain itself has remained eternally impressive through the years, but the number of people heading up it has certainly changed in the past 20 years. The rotating cable car that takes you to the top is ten times the size it was - once it would take 15 people, now it\u2019s more like 100 each trip. The five-minute ride to the top should be on every Cape Town itinerary, rewarding you with wonderful views of Cape Town, Robben Island and the Peninsula from the top. Picnic or visit the restaurant, while you watch the wildlife in the National Park - you\u2019ve got plenty of time as the cable cars are every 10-15 minutes and finish at 9.30pm in the summer. Or if you\u2019re really daring you can even abseil off the top of the mountain when you\u2019re ready to get down."

The cable car\u2019s floor rotates a full 360 degrees to let you see the entire span.

It\u2019s been a protected area for over a 100 years. Interestingly, the table mountain was formed about 600 million years ago under the sea. Yes, this entire area was under the sea! The movement of glaciers produced the flat table top. Infact, the whole city of Cape town is reclaimed land.Once on top of the table mountain you can do self or guided walks, click pictures or just soak in the breathtaking views. There is also a small open restobar for people to grab a quick beer and soak in the atmosphere, if they so please to do. We were lucky to get a beautiful, clear day at the mountain, otherwise if it\u2019s cloudy the whole trip can go for a toss."

The queues were long but we were up the mountain in about 20 minutes from when we first queued. We did the hop on and off tour bus which was a great value.

Certain things must be done by ourselves and hiking the Table Mountain to the peak, it takes up to three hours, better done going up than coming down, is just one of those activities that make an experience of a journey. The alternative would be joining a huge queue that takes up to one hour to clear and go up by Cablecar.On the way up, walking, there are tracks, more or less evident, and the views that come up while going up are breath taking. Nature unfolds and presents itself more beautifully as one hikes up and up, going for paths and corners. To fully experience the journey use hat, protect your body with FPS 30 and take 2 litres of water per person for this 3 hour walking up. through the small sized bushes and deserted areas of the mountain. If tired, drink water as dehydration makes one feel tired, dizzy and usually does not present itself as being thirsty. If alone, make sure you have local sim card on your mobile to easily call emergency if need arises. Bring a blouse to protect from wind if weather changes.In 2,5 hour weather may change... if you sense it either spring it up or down - You do not want to be caught in the middle of the mountain and having to climb under rain or strong wind.Lots of opportunities on the way up to sit, rest, and shoot photos from magnificent angles.Once up there, from one of two obvious paths, take time to walk on the surface of the Table Mountain, probably another 1-hour activity to sense it all in the silence of being all over the world, with views for all sides of Cape Town and the Reservoir.Suggest coming down using the Cableway as a)no queues b)protects your knees from efforts on the way down, and you will need them to walk on the days after."

When we got out at the top the wind nearly took your head off and it was very chilly. You had to be very careful of your footing. Having said that the views in every direction (Cape Town, Robben Island etc) were stunning and we wouldn't have missed them despite the wind and cold.

There is a very short walk, which most people take. This is about 15 minutes roundtrip. There is a clean washroom on route. You could take a free guided walk, however i don't feel this is necessary. There are several longer walks and even lengthy hikes over rough terrain. The map in the Information guide is not a very good one. My wife and I are hikers, so we took approximately 3 hours to do a roundtrip hike to Beacon (get directions, as this could be confusing). At the very least do the Agama walk, which should take 30 - 45 minutes roundtrip (not counting stops to the photos)."

I am still trying to work out how I can get one back to Australia for a pet). We didn't allow enough time on our first visit, so went back for a second day. Wear your walking shoes, and leave yourself plenty of time to enjoy this spectacular spot!"

At the top, a wonderland of flowers, rocks and birds, with breathtaking views in all directions. Easy pathways and walkways. My husband hiked up Platteklip Gorge, 1.5 hours of hard going, but he loved it. Some people saw whales from the top of the mountain, swimming in the bays below. I couldn't pick them out even with binoculars. Need to keep an eye on the weather which can be unpredictable, and In strong winds the cable car doesn't run. But wonderfully calm and sunny when we were there, altogether an unforgettable experience, highly recommended."

So prominent and magnificent a view on the skyline I can't see how you wouldn't want to go climb it every week. The ascent is not too tough dependent upon the weather and much like many of the walks in the area, the people are always friendly.I took the cable car down to the bottom with the family which was a little disappointing by comparison but that may have been the endorphins talking.Overall I would most definitely recommend it and I advise to get there early! As traffic and parking is a nightmare around the entrance but to be fair parking is a bit of a nightmare all over Cape Town."

If you are a tourist then I would suggest The Hop on/Hop off bus tour which goes directly to the mountain from the city and they are quite excellent. There are 2 ways to go up: Either walk the mountain trail or go up the revolving Cable Car (which is also wheelchair friendly). I would not suggest purchasing tickets in advance as the mountain is sometimes closed due to poor weather that is often unpredictable. I would also suggest taking a jacket, gloves and a scarf as it can sometimes be freezing on the mountain. There is a take away/restaurant on the mountain that has good and affordable breakfasts which is real value for money. You definitely need your camera when on top of the mountain as the views are breathtaking and spectacular. Enjoy Table Mountain."

But I couldn't have been more wrong.We were lucky enough to have 5 gloriously sunny days in Cape Town and arrived around 10am at the pay station. We didn't have to queue for long - maybe 15mins - before we were whisked up in the fabulous rotating cable car. And when we got to the top, we were once again taken aback at how stunning the views Table Mountain provides are. For the less adventurous (me), there are easy walks and wooden platforms jutting out to give views over Newlands and the docks to the left of the cable car exit.To the right, the views over Camps Bay and the rich blue sea beyond show the city in its full glory. There is flora and fauna to look at if you can take your eyes off the views - stunning butterflies and cute lizards and dassies.There is also a more difficult walk which we didn't attempt as I was in flip flops.We allowed about 2hours at the top of the mountain - including having a quick drink in the restaurant - as it was starting to get busy (the sky was clear so the perfect mountain view day) and made our way down again via the cable car. It is possible to walk up and down the mountain, but the cable car is quick, easy and good value. We parked on the lower slopes - there's quite a bit of parking, though from memory, it can be a struggle to find a space later in the day - and easily drove away without queues or fuss.Make Table Mountain an early start to your day and enjoy it without having to wait for a space on the viewing decks"

We had a great walking on top and ended our nice evening with a glass of wine while enjoying the view from this amazing spot. Cableways are very reliable and run on time. They are not overcrowded and provide a good view of Cape Town and surroundings on the way up and down the mountain. Watching the sunset on this spot is a memory you will carry on for life."

Also you hope that the table cloth (clouds) is not on when you visit - and for our time there it wasn't. The views across Cape Town and way beyond are breathtaking.If the cable car Q's are too long (late morning or early afternoon) return at around 4.30pm as we did and you will still be in time to take the last rides. Although we got up quickly (30mins?) it took much longer to get thr cable car back down with so many leaving at dusk. Take very warm clothing with you - when the sun sets it get's very cold indeed."

If you only fancy go one way you can easily buy a single on the cable car - spectacular views over the city,the Atlantic, Hout Bay etc etc etc etc!!!Warning though - always be mindful of your surroundings, stay on the paths as some loose rock areas could give way....sunscreen, hats, food and water....and also check that you don't have an opportunistic fellow following you up or down the routes looking to enhance his fortune!"

I am a quadriplegic from a gymnastics injury sustained at Michigan State University in April 1991 who is interested in global travel and participating in activities not normally associated with disabled people. I\u2019m currently on an adventure that will explore worldwide handicapped accessibility. Many people have travel blogs, but there are none that I know of that come from the vantage point of a wheelchair user going off the accessible path.The mountain is only open when there\u2019s good visibility and light winds. Check the Table Mountain website to see if the cableway is open before going. It\u2019s a 15 minute cab ride from the waterfront to the base of Table Mountain. It\u2019s a short wheel from the ticket booth to the elevator with a slight uphill grade. The elevator takes us to the loading area of the cableway. I\u2019m able to wheel directly from the loading area to the cable car, the surface is flat. During the 5 minute ride the cable car rotates 360 degrees for a view of the mountain, Cape Town and Table Bay. Table Mountain is 3,563 feet above sea level. The exit of the cable car surface is flat. There are several steep hills once at the top. The pavement is very rocky and uneven. There are two hills I need pushed up by my friend Alejandro. Most people in manual wheelchairs would need help up these hills. The area a top the mountain is much bigger than I thought, approximately 2 miles from side to side.It would be difficult to visit Table Mountain in a manual wheelchair by yourself. The most difficult part will be wheeling around the top of the mountain. Of the 2 miles, I was able to wheel 50 yards by myself, with Alejandro\u2019s help I was able to wheel 100 yards. There are also some steps in places making that area not accessible for wheelchairs. There is a restaurant that is accessible but the ramp to the eating area is a little steep. The accessible bathroom is located by the return cable car. The view is spectacular and well worth the trip up. There's not much, if anything to do to make this more accessible having to deal with the natural contour of the mountain. It would be nice if wheelchair users would get a discount since the terrain is difficult to wheel around with areas needing help from an able body person.Photos of Table Mountain can be viewed at http://offtheaccessiblepath.smugmug.com/Africa/South-Africa/Table-Mountain/Table-Mountain/Accessibility wise Table Mountain would receive a 2.5/5 rating."

Also beware of inconsiderate queue jumpers, those I saw were Russian and knew exactly what they were doing, shame on them.The views are everywhere on the net, but NOTHING can replace being there.

During our return visit to South Africa another visit to the top of Table Mountain was a must for us. Both trips we had brilliant sunshine with no wind - perfect. Please don't rush this visit, spend the day there and potter because there is so much to see and do. The views are awesome and you certainly feel you are on top of the world. A wonderful place to visit and with a cafe there you are never short of something to eat, drink and relax when you want to. A third trip to South Africa - yes, Table Mountain will be on the list again. It's a must."

That could have been avoided if we had: 1) gone earlier when it was cooler; 2) known where to go; we were dropped off via taxi where the cable cars board, but had to walk on the street for another 20 mins to reach the mouth of the trail. After the abortive hike, my husband and daughter returned and took the cable cars up, avoiding the long lines by getting there around 8:30. They had a glorious time and reported that there was plenty of opportunity for walking at the top. (I was working and could not accompany them.) BUt if I had it to do over, I would have either prepared for a proper hike, or planned to summit via cable car and get my exercise at the summit. Definitely an amazing destination!"

We visited Table Mountain the first day that we arrived because we called and heard that the cable car that transports you to the top was open (as it is closed when it is too windy). The price for the cable car is a bit steep but if you have student ids you can get a discount. Once we reached the top we had good visibility for about 10 minutes and then the rain clouds set in and it got very wet and cold (very quickly). We planned to return another day for better views but didn't have a chance as the cable car was closed for the next couple of days of our trip (due to bad weather)."

We came with a tour guide, who pre-purchased our tickets and dropped us off at the entrance, which meant we literally walked straight to the gondola, which was just arriving. Had we driven up we would have parked on the street about 1 mile from the entrance and if we didn't have pre-paid tickets we would have stood in the queue at the ticket office.Therefore, we highly recommend purchasing tickets online and do not drive - if not on a tour, take the HoHo bus, which has a stop at the entrance.The gondolas are amazing and the floor actually turns so you see in every direction going up and coming down. They also have some seats for those unsteady on their feet. The view from up top is amazing, but ensure you check the weather to ensure it is clear. We adjusted our tour sequence to let the AM fog burn off before heading up.They also have a restaurant, however we did not sample or even check out the menu, so unable to comment. Way too busy walking along the top. Around the cable car station the paths are level and well maintained, being easy for everyone to walk on. Their are a few stairs as well. Further away from the station the path becomes a walkway on rocks, which is rather uneven, but still easy to walk on.We spent an excellent hour up top and could easily have stayed for at least double that time."

The hike time was about two and one half hours, but well worth it. If you are not into hiking, you can take the cable car to the top. I think it was maybe $5 or $10. When you are at the top, they have a pretty nice play to eat and grab a drink. I guess I never really realized how beautiful the beaches in Cape Town were. When at the top, you can see how pretty the water is. The colors are amazing. We were able to take some wonderful pictures that we will always treasure."

From the minute we arrived at 8-30am on a beautiful still Cape Town morning it was so beautiful. The cable car ride was quite exhilarating with the views overlooking cape Town breathtaking. No need to push or rush as the floor revolves meaning everyone gets a great view. Once on the mountain top,it is surprisingly large with plenty of walks of around 45 minutes or so. Again the views from all sides are quite stupendous. We saw some people doing the 2 hour walk and at least one climber plus some abseilers. Remember to take a hat and water as it can get very hot up there. During the day my daughter lost her iphone. Not sure where, we backtracked and decided to call Table Mountain reception the following morning on the off chance. To our daughter's delight, one of the staff on the top of the mountain had found it and handed it in! In a city which has a reputation for crime, this restored our faith in humanity and a big thank you to whoever it was who handed it in. It was a brilliant morning. Recommendation is to book your ticket online and go early morning as the mountain gets extremely busy and waiting time can be 2 hours plus especially if you have to queue to buy a ticket. Also it gets hotter as the day goes by and parking becomes more difficult. If you do one thing in Cape Town, Table Mountain is it."

We bought tickets before going up & this saved time waiting in queues (which at this time of year is minimal). We got there & back by taxi but the red route of the hop on/hop off bus also goes there. Cable car was good, it moves you around whilst in the cab so that you get the opportunity of seeing it 360 degrees. You can spend as much or as little time as you personally want at the top. Views are fantastic everywhere. There is a cafe/restaurant at the top. It can get quite cool at the top so take a jumper/top just in case. It may seem sunny with no cloud when you are at the bottom but as I said at the beginning things can change quite quickly. We had to queue for quite a while to get back down in the cable car & I did get cold - so beware! You can't visit Cape Town without visiting Table Mountain. Highly recommended."

If you are travelling by car and there is a lack of parking on the way up, drive past the cable car station and there are more parking spaces available."

The restaurant at the top is overprices and expensiveTake proper walking shoes as the far side of the upper part of the mountain are very rough. phone before going up there as the cableway is often closed as a result of high winids.

This happened for 2 days during our stay. If you get a nice day on your trip- head to Table Mountain! The cable car takes only 5 or so minutes, but in the mornings the queue can be very long- so be prepared for that. There are car parks all along the road leading up to the cablecar entrance, but it can be a 5-10minute walk depending on if you get a good spot or not. Plan on spending at minimum 2-3 hours exploring the different viewpoints here. We also did abseiling which we signed up for in advance and takes about 1 hour total. If you are adventurous, I would highly recommend looking into abseiling, or doing a guided hike instead of taking the cable car. There is a huge cafe in the middle which offers a ton of food options and drinks. It is quite pricey. You can bring your own food and drinks, however. You will likely be walking up and down many stairs so wear good shoes! There are some spots where you can hike out a bit (10 minutes or so) to explore. Highly recommend stopping at Table Mountain during your stay in Capetown as it provides AMAZING views of the city and Lion's head. I won't forget it!"

Unfortunately, it was too late in the day to visit Table Mountain. For the next five days, there was a haze or cloud around the mountain. On the first morning with no clouds, we hastily headed towards TM. We had not purchased tickets ahead of time (bad move on our part,) so we had to wait for thirty minutes in line to buy tickets. The cableway had only opened about twenty minutes prior. And the line behind us grew very quickly. We then had to wait another twenty minutes in the cableway line. But the view from the top was amazing!! Well worth the time spent parking and in line. A tip: if you take the HOHO bus you will be able to get off right at the entrance. However, if, like us, you drive, you will find yourself without a parking space if you wait much after 10:00 am. There is no real parking lot. Parking is along the drive up to the cableway. So if you are driving, pick the first available spot you see. The bonus for us was that a group of firefighters, probably 80 of them, were getting in line as we were coming down the stairs. They all started singing and dancing. It was the perfect ending to an amazing day!"

Moving off the paths was strongly discouraged, but the paths were organised in such a way as to give great views of the whole Cape.

On our first visit to Cape Town in December 2014 - Table Mountain was HIGH up there on our list of places to visit :-)It was the 26th December and we made our way up to the cable way. The weather was starting to turn sour (clouds rolling in) but the staff were still selling tickets and letting people pay good money and line up to wait for the cable car... I do not agree with this at all. We were a little naive to think that the weather would be clear up on the mountain but we had no idea just how foggy / windy / rainy / COLD it would be once we got up there. I feel that the staff should really make you aware of the weather conditions and advise people that the visibility is poor (at the time of purchasing tickets / ticket sales counter). This was people can make an informed decision as to whether or not to pay the money and go up or perhaps skip it for that day and come back when the weather is better.We shall return one day on a nice and sunny day and I am sure (as we have seen photos from fellow travellers) that the view is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING once u there on a n\u00e9e clear day !"

But there were a lot of other people with the same idea. So yes, it was very busy. I had to park on the road at least 3/4 of a mile from the ticket line. Fortunately, I chatted with folks in line who decided to order tickets on line. This easily cut an hour off our wait time. The cable cars are smooth and fast and rotate 360 on each trip so you get to see pretty much everything. Once on top, the views are excellent...stay as long as you like. The reviews that complain about \"too many people\" and \"long waits\" are a little ironic but it is true that you could lose a lot of time here. So keep on eye on the weather, plan ahead, go early (or late) and buy tickets on line. You'll be glad you did."

The ascent in the cable car, which rotates through 360degs as it climbs, is breathtaking. It takes less than ten minutes to get to the cable head and you're quickly out and on the plateau itself. I'd no idea as to what I should expect to see, but nothing that I did disappointed. Of course there's a gift shop and place to get some good coffee and food (but be prepared for an ordering/collection experience - if in doubt ask staff for advice). However, nuff zed of mundane things. The views, because this is what you come for, are fantastic. the air is so clear you can almost see the spindrift on the waves thousands of meters away. You can see Robben Island sitting low and squat out in Table Bay, so reflect on how the top of Table Mountain, a signifier of freedom, must have appeared to the poor souls incarcerated there. The views of Cape Town itself are equally stunning whilst watching the cable cars ascend and descend can be quite giddying.Go prepared, btw, and take a warm sweater or similar with you because the breeze can be a bit cool up there and in summer the sun can be deceptively strong. The trip back down can be a tad tedious with lots of queuing and shuffling along to the cars. Tip is to buy your tickets for the trip in advance; the queues can be epic."

Don't be fooled by the weather either - it changes constantly. We left our hotel and it was so cloudy you couldn't see across the street. Literally ten minutes later when we arrived by cab at Table Mountain, it was bright and sunny. We almost stayed back at our hotel because we thought the cable cars would be canceled; thankfully we didn't do that!We had breakfast at the cafe at the top and the coffee was excellent. The little dassies run around everywhere and are incredibly cute. The views on top of the mountain are the best in Cape Town. The best part of Table Mountain is being in the clouds. They literally swirl all around you and you can smell them! It's unbelievable. Highly recommend going here."

In our case it took two days to have the right weather and then as soon as we got up top the winds kicked up and they closed. We were able to enjoy the walks and views but the winds could get quite blustery/gusty. Beware of taxi scams. Taxi driver first tried to convince us that there was a set rate to Camps Bay where we were staying. The hotel had said that it shouldn't be more than 70 Rand. It ended up costing 100 Rand due to our driver's attempts to keep taking \"scenic\" routes. (We knew our way back and attempted to direct him.)"

The best advice I can give; If it's a clear, cloud free day at the top, do it.If you planned something else that day, And haven't done this yet and are due to do this later in the week; Change your plans - Seriously. Don't hesitate, grab the nearest cab and go.It might be the only time it's clear while you are there. This is not to be missed.I speak from experience; the first time I went to Cape town, we had a pre-booked trip the only day the mountain was cloud free, and didn't make it up there. the 2nd trip we made it. It's a must do."

Your ticket is valid for a two week period of your choicw2) Remeber that the conditions (wind or cloud) can close the cableway so be prepared to be flexible over yor visit date. My motto is if you see the cable car running , go for it, because tomorrow it may not be3) If arriving by taxi or the hop on hop off bus, you'll be dropped off right by the ticket office. If you're travelling by car, be prepared to walk to the cableway station4) There is plenty of parking available on the road to the cableway station. My advice is to avoid parking on the roadway leading up to the cableway as this can mean a 30 minute walk at busy periods. Instead, drive right up to the cableway station and then carry on past the bus turning point. There is plenty of parking on the roadside beyond and it will probably mean a shorter walk5) Most people head for the open sides of the cable car - but it rotates as it moves up the mountain, so wherever you are you will get a great view6) Wear the tight footwear for your visit - flip flops are not ideal!7) It is 6 or 7 degrees cooler at the summit than the bottom - You may need a sweater or jacket8) I suspect many people never venture more than 400m from the upper cableway station. Take the opportinity to see some fabulous views and fill your lungs with fresh air by following one of the many well-marked trailsEnjoy your trip - we did!"

You can never tire of the views and it is so peaceful once you are away from the cable car entrance.Some tips: pick a good day, beware it can be cool on top, the queues move quicker than you expect and picking the right day ( for the weather) beats a pre-booked ticket I suggest.

We got in touch with Lauren Medcalf of Mothercity Hikers - she is a DEAT certified mountain guide and her contact number is + 27 72 5303464 or lauren@mothercityhikers.co.za....and from day 1, she has been ever so patient with us, having answered over 2 dozen various queries of ours. Remember, we never exercise, trek or have ever climbed a mountain before. Lauren assured us - nothing to worry, and we trusted her words. We decided to do the woody ravine route. On the day of our climb, she picked us up promptly at 6am, and brouth with her, napsacks, hiking poles, hats, jackets and we started climbing at approximated 6.30... took out 6 tedious hours, but it was worth every effort climbing the oldest mountain in the world ! What superb views, vegetation, scenery and flowers.... We huffed and puffed and panted right to the very top and though at some points my leg cramped up, lauren was prompt to stop, give me something to drink, an energiser and I was back to walking.... At the end of It, I got a certificate saying - Congrats ! you climbed the table mountain !This is Capetowns No 1 attraction, and I am grateful to Lauren for helping me achieve my dream of climbing the Table Mountain. The route is rough, and a bit tedious, but with the right guide to push you onwards, youre in safe hands ! At the end of it, we climbed 1200 metres and walked 9.8 kms ! Thank god the weather was superb. Thank you Lauren once again, and for those reading - if youre young, fit, and want to do something different, perhaps a once in a life time experience, get in touch with Lauren and Climb to Table Mountain, its truly worth it ! We came down by cable Car - Ooh what a steep decline ( R 115 per person)....thank god for the cable way!"

I'd recommend buying your cable car pass in advance as the ticket que is big and then you have to que again to get into the car.

We had a perfect day weather wise and took full advantage of it. We did not purchase our passes on-line which I would suggest. You can skip the line this way and while we had about a 25 minute wait, I could see where there might be days the wait is much longer. I'm not sure what we were thinking.This is just one of those natural sites you don't want to miss. For squeamish height people, you can ride up in the middle of the large gondola and never have to look down. For the people who have to charge to the front and push to the \"best\" view, don't waste your time...the floor rotates 360 degrees on the quick ride up and down so while you start at the front looking up the mountain, before you know it you are turned around looking at the ocean. The cost was reasonable as is everything in South Africa. The Rand was about 10:1 to the dollar (I always get this wrong so to be clear, for every dollar you get ten Rand so ten dollars=one hundred Rand).For accessibility, there are areas close to the gondola that are pathways and there are some close, short trails which are wheelchair accessible but the entire mountain area doesn't have a path. There is a restaurant that was accessible too and the gondola wouldn't be a problem at all.Don't miss this if you are in town."

With bad childhood memories rushing back, we approached the cablecars. I was blown away by how much more professional it effcient it was.The cable cars are bigger and now rotate. All in took about 15 minutes and I was soaking in potentially the best view in the world.The weather was warm but not hot, a light breeze and just enough cloud cover to make for the most spectacular views.The whole experienced changed my view on Table Mountain.Now I know why it is one of the top tourist attractions in the world."

The cable car itself is rotating and you already have in there a spectacular view over Cape Town. But not comparable to the \"real\" view from the mountain itself.

My sister had recommended me to climb up the Table Mountain via Platteklip Gorge after her own families experience a week before us. She didn\u2019t tell me how tough it was though, but just from the sight from the start we had two persons in our family who bailed out. They would have made it, but if you\u2019re not up for a challenge it wouldn\u2019t have been a nice experience. The rest of us took our backpacks with 2 water bottles each and snacks like fruit, water melon and cookies. Since it was a very warm day we skipped the sweaters we were recommended to bring. The climb, it is a climb even if you don\u2019t have to use your hands, takes nearly 2 hours. To manage you will have to be in a pretty good shape. When entering the gorge you realize that during not so hot days it can be quite chilly and that you might need a sweater or jacket since you walk in the shadow and the wind can be quite rough. The weather can change quickly too, so it is better to be safe than sorry. After the great work out you are rewarded with fantastic sights. There are easier walks on the top for the people choose to go up by cable car and of course you get stunning sights too. But you feel a lot better having climbed all the way up yourself! Some people choose to trek the way down instead, but I\u2019m not sure that is a lot easier. Knees and legs will be quite sore after that too.Mind that there can be a very long car queue both up or down to the cable car station. It took us 35 minutes to get down. It would have been quicker to walk down to the crossing or the parking places closer to it. Don\u2019t trek in bad weather! Going through a cloud is both wet, cold and you\u2019re not sure to get your reward.There is a fee for the cable car to get down. Unless you'd like to hike down."

As described in other reviews the vista is stunning in several directions, and the top of the mountain has not been spoiled, despite the huge number of visitors that it accommodates. The pathways are easy to walk and the views are unspoiled by fences or safety rails; go as close to the edge as you dare!It is best not to pre-book the cable car since Cape Town is a windy city; the cable car may be closed and the mountain may be covered in cloud. You can ascend in cloud to see the mountain top, but the views will be sacrificed.Practical advice: * Take the first cable car of the day - 8am in the summer [December] to reduce time spent in the queue and to get away from crowds * There is no car park by the cable car so leave your car on the side of the approach road as soon as you see other cars parked * Wear comfortable shoes so that you can walk on rocks at the top * Allow twice the time indicated on the information boards for the walks, simply because you need to stop so often to enjoy the views* Binoculars are useful but not compulsory * Go looking for the Dassies close to the caf\u00e9; they hang out close by but are not necessarily easy to spot [look over the walls onto the rocks below] * There is no need to take up a certain position by the window in the cable car because it revolves on the way up * Don't forget sunscreen. And last but not least * Allow plenty of time because you will kick yourself if you don't!"

            "review": "Brilliant. Hard to add anything to what other reviewers have said for such an iconic place and a 'must' for all visitors to Cape Town, with it's fabulous views over the city, coast and the Cape itself.I guess the key advice, seen in all the guide books and tourist guides, is to go as soon as you can - the weather on and around the mountain is very changeable and it can be shut for days. I believe that we went on the only full day it was open during our 5 day stay. It's not just the cloud that blankets the top (the 'tablecloth') but also the wind - there were days when the mountain was clear but the cable car closed because of the wind. Very much worth checking the online site for the latest position before you set off.If you use the hop-on/hop-off bus to get you there, they will know the current position - ask before you get on (it was on their notice board at the the V&A Marina). If you drive, as we did, parking can be difficult and you may have to go several hundred metres. If you park too early before the cable car it can be quite a hike uphill, so it's worth driving past the entrance and, if necessary, turning round (can be a bit awkward) as this part is fairly level.You can buy tickets online which are valid for one trip over a period you choose (2 weeks I think) - make sure you order both up and down tickets on the cable car, if that's what you want - they're done separately. This can save you quite a queue for tickets once there, but doesn't miss the queue for the cable car itself (in our case, luckily, almost non-existent around 3pm). If you want to walk, either up or down, be well prepared - see other reviews! Even going up on the cable car it's worth taking an extra layer of clothes, and even some sort of rain gear - the weather can change quite quickly (and if they feel the cable car may have to close they'll sound a siren to warn you).The cable car isn't scary (but then I ski), though it is very high above the ground nearer the top. It rotates to give everyone a good view - an excellent bit of technology. Near the top is a pretty good caf\u00e9/restaurant, and it's not badly priced either.The walk around all of the top is well marked and fairly easy, giving lots of different views and some changes in landscape. The top is not as flat as it looks from below! I guess all the way round might take a couple of hours, though we didn't do it all.Amazing place!"

The route can be very challenging at times (by no means mountaineering, but some serious terrain) - especially in the last 20 minutes before the summit. It should not be undertaken lightly, but when you have reached the top the sense of achievement is amazing - much like the view.Take the cable car down!!"

The Table Mountain National Park greets you with its unique ruggedness stretching down to Cape Point. You have views over Clifton and Camps Bay below and across to Robben Island.There are numerous paths that lead you in every direction to enjoy the various views along which you will see the unique flora or fynbos that grows only in this area, also look out for bird sightings from the tiny sunbirds to the majestic raptors soaring above. You may even get the opportunity to see the famous Dassies as the bound across the rocks. It is best to get up here early as it does tend to get over crowded, as the day goes on. It will also allow you time to see more. However even on a hot day it can still get chilly at the top. In winter make sure you have the proper clothing as it can get very cold with the \"wind chill\". There is a small shop and caf\u00e9 at the top so hot drinks and food are available."

We started off in the Kirstenbosch Gardens, which are worth a look on their own, and took the Skeleton Gorge route. It took us about 4 hours to get up the mountain to the cable car and restaurant. However, we did make a pit stop at the lake on the top for a dip.A lot of the route up was under shade and it was an enjoyable hike with a nice mix of easy walking, ladders and use-your-hands hiking.You're at the top for just under an hour to walk to the cable car and the 360 degree views are spectacular. Well worth the effort.We had planned to take the cable car back down the mountain but the wait was close to two hours. We decided to hike down the more popular route. For me this was a big mistake! It was all in the sun and we all got scorched! It was also a steep climb down to the very end and we saw a lot of climbers fall and slip en route. It took us just under 2 hours to get back down.I would definitely recommend the hike but I would get a drink and wait for the cable car or take the same route (skeleton gorge) back down next time :)"

Unfortunately, the cafe clearly isn't set up for early morning business. The breakfast buffet wasn't open so we had to have sandwiches for breakfast and then we had to order coffees at the kiosk to collect after. The coffee, just a simple filter coffee, took over 20 minutes to be ready. This is simply unacceptable. How on earth can filter coffee take 20 minutes to make?!The problem with running the cable car in all weathers apart from extreme wind if problematic when very foggy. We booked tickets and missed out on all the sights after travelling all that way. Still, it's a natural wonder so I can't complain about nature taking control and doing what it does.

The views of the city, harbour and the Lion's head are some of the most spectacular sights that I have seen in my years traveling. The only drawback of visiting Table Mountain is the never ending queue during the summer period. I waited 45 min in the blistering morning sun and found myself nowhere near the front of the line. We eventually left, but returned the same day in the evening when the queue was much shorter, and enjoyed the sights."

OK, so we had to wait for 30 minutes to get a ride up - but it was primarily under shelter with little misters making the 31C much more bearable. And we had a similar wait to get back down again, with not so much shade this time - bring a little umbrella, you won't regret having to carry it around with you. However, these are tiny things in comparison to the overall experience. The cable car revolves as you rise, completing a full 360 degrees - so no rush and bustle to get the 'best' vantage points inside the carriage. Extraordinary views on the way up, both of the surrounding countryside and the brave people hiking up near precipitous paths to the top. There's loads of stuff to do once you get to the top, from short walks to proper hikes. Fantastic variety of flowers and plants to look at, finding the tiniest of spaces within which to thrive. We saw two hawks heckling each other - we weren't sure if they were indeed fighting or just putting on a show for us tourists. Huge yellow and black butterflies flitting from one place to another. Did I mention the ice cream? And cold (nearly freezing) bottled water for less than R20 (less than \u00a31 in UK currency). A fantastic experience all round. We bought our tickets on the Red Bus where you get a R25 reduction in the price and a quicker queue that bypasses the ticket office. Who cares if everyone that goes to Cape Town goes up to Table Mountain - it's a must-see."

We went up Skeleton gorge and down Platteklip. This way you avoid the wait and crowds at the cable car. Skeleton gorge is a fantastic walk starting in the shade of the forest, but Platteklip, though quicker is harsh, featureless and steep. Certain precautions must be followed: carry at least 1l of water and a waterproof jacket. Do not climb if clouds or mist are expected. The views are phenomenal, and well worth the visit. Walking around the mountain leads to the discovery of hidden treasures like rock archways and the resivoirs, as well as diverse flora and fauna. There is a cost to climbing via Skeleton gorge as you have to pay to get in via Kirstenbosch gardens. The only facilities once up the mountain are at the cable car station."

It felt a little like all the other sightseeing trips I'd been on before - taking a cable car up, walking around a minimal space crowded with tourists while snapping photos, blah blah and then coming down again. Boy was I wrong. Even in the summer, a chill wind blows atop the mountain, making hikes very enjoyable. Once you get up to the mountain, there is a small tourist spot and cafe where everyone takes their photos. Then you begin to stroll beyond that area and you're in for a treat. There are a few routes you can walk on the mountain, for quite a distance. There is even a route where you can hike down the mountain (at your own risk! And takes a few hours. If you so wish, you can enquire about the guided tours they have up /down the mountain from 09 00 hrs to 15 00 hrs). Another route takes you on the horizontal face of the mountain, amongst the indigenous flora of the region. It's very peaceful, very serene. The breathtaking view of the surrounding is the most rewarding. A most wonderful way to spend a few hours, even watch the sunset. Buy your tickets online to avoid a long Q when you're up at the mountain. Check online for the timing of the last cable down (around 21 30 hrs in Jan) so you can plan ahead if you want to do an evening trip. Driving to the cableway station is best as it would be terribly expensive getting a cab down. Alternatively, there are the MYCITI and CITY SIGHTSEEING\u2019S HOP-ON, HOP-OFF BUS options."

People say it's best to do it on a clear day, but we did it when it was quite cloudy (the first time) and the clouds were perfect for when it got too warm as by the top it was freezing, but very welcomed. We had a lot of fun being excited when the clouds shifted for a better view, though we also went up second time when it wasn't cloudy and if you don't mind the heat, I'd well advise it- just as spectacular essentially due to no clouds hiding away the view. Both were just as amazing though! If you come to Cape Town, you can't not visit!"

This is a duplicate of our review of the Aerial Cableway to Table Mountain because, in our minds, you can't separate one from the other. THE major attraction in Cape Town in our opinion, and the cable car is the easy way up to the top of Table Mountain, when the wind isn't too strong. Unfortunately for us, for the first 2 days we were in Cape Town the mountain was closed because the wind was too strong. Each morning we checked if it was open, and on the 3rd day - Success, the mountain was open and we immediately bought our tickets on-line and headed for the lower cable car station. Thank god we bought the tickets first because when you get to the station there is one queue for those with tickets, and a second enormously long queue for those who needed to buy tickets first. Tickets are valid for 14 days so buy one first so you're ready to go as soon as the mountain is open. The cable car takes many people at a time and does one complete rotation as you ascend or descend so everybody gets to see the views. On top there are shops, toilets, a restaurant, and a choice of 3 routes round huge top on clearly marked paths, ranging in time from 15 minutes too re an hour. We liked the views in all directions, and particularly the \"Dassies\", small approx 2 foot long animals native to the mountain and rumored to be related to the elephant!We chose the middle length route but unfortunately had to cut that short as the cloud came down and visibility reduced dramatically. Even so, it was a great excursion and well worth the wait and the visit despite the weather. When we got down, we found the mountain was closed again!"

This was a very fun route including steep steps, ladders, climbing boulders through waterfalls and finally coming out over the treetops to a spectacular view of the city between the sloping sides of the mountain. This trail continued onto Smuts Track which is mostly flat but with some steep climbs further on. Our map says Smuts Track is 'exhausting' but we didn't find it too hard. We are however both 22 years old and quite fit. Smuts Track is a scenic route along the side of the mountain which leads to Maclear's Beacon, the highest point of Table Mountain at 1085m. It was covered in clouds when we arrived but it was worth it! We got a few good glimpses of the city through the clouds. From here we continued across to the cable car area (mostly flat all the way across). The tabletop clouds are fast rolling across the mountain but waterfall over the edge and quickly vanish due to the altitude! It's very cool to watch. We got some amazing views of the sea, city, Lion's Head and Signal Hill. From the Botanical Gardens to the cable car it took us about 3.5 to 4 hours. Highly recommended route to climb and a must-do if you visit Cape Town."

It is perfectly safe, perfectly Doable.The Skeleton Gorge route is probably the nicest way up because you get to go through (or begin with a substantial visit to) the great Kirstenbosch Gardens, and then go up through Montagne forest. Once you're up, it's fairly gradual and thoroughly interesting to carry on (as you must, if you want to take the cable car down) to McClear's Beacon, the highest point. It's a great walk!

But has to be a clear day. Take plenty of water and good shoes. Only criticism is that it was not sign-posted very well (we took a wrong turn and ended up going down again!)."

We have not experienced this fortunately, but there was a group of police officers doing some training hikes. I suppose it would be worth a check with your hotel if you are looking to do this incredible hike.A must do!"

The ride itself is a memorable experience, and the view from the top of the mountain is just awesome. Though it is a mountain, once we reach the top on the cable car, its almost like a flat land with large stones and plants where we can trek at our leisure. The view of the distant mountains, the oceans and the harbour is just amazing. There is a restaurant and a beautiful souvneir shop on top. Before planning a trip to the Table Top Mountain, check the local weather, since the cable car service will be shut down during windy and foggy climates."

We arrived early in the morning on a perfect day, glorious weather and our hotel was very close to the mountain so we chose to go there in the afternoon, it was very lucky we did because the wind that Capetown is famous for got up later in the afternoon and the cable car was closed for new customers, we had a lovely couple of hours enjoying spectacular views go each side of the peninsula, plus watching clouds rolling in over the mountain top. Table Mountain is why Cape town was settled in the first place, it creates a microclimate and you can't go anywhere in the town without being aware of it. Every visitor must go, bit be warned, it closes frequently and that when it has been closed for a few days it means queues can be rather long, up to two hours Apparantly, we were lucky, we just walked straight on to the cable car. A must see destination for every visitor, the views are breathtaking."

One frustration is we seemed to have arrived at a just the peak queue time and waited quite a while in the hot sun until we got to the top of the mountain. Once there, we noticed there was almost no queue to get back down. But when we were ready to go back, once again there was a long queue though it went more quickly. Lesson go early or go late not around 10am. Also when there's a line to go up, it gets chaotic - they haven't figured out the logistics of timing the delivery of people in the lift so suddenly there are more people than can fit on the platform and the people coming out of the ariel cableway the same direction we were going in. It seemed unnecessarily chaotic. If you time it right, you'll avoid the transport chaos and just enjoy the view. I recommend the free tour at the top - start every 30 minutes and last about 20-30 minutes. Well informed and friendly guides with a sense of humor."

On the top you can find a cafe/restaurant, shops etc. but above all a nature experience and fabulous views over Cape Town. There's also a free guided tour every hour, which is to recommend. Remember to tip your tour guide. Note: the cable cars can be closed, or be closed in the middle of the day, due to weather conditions such as wind or visibility (the \"table cloth\" of clouds) so check the status on their website before you go. They also have a half price special if you want to go up after 6 p.m. and view the sunset. You can walk up the hill as well but that's a real hike."

The best part is that it's free if you hike!We hiked up Table Mountain via the Platteklip Gorge trail. This is a tough trail that goes straight up via the most direct route. It will take 3 hours if you are not in good shape, 2 hours if you are in ok shape, and a little more than an hour if you are in great shape and hike a lot. The views were stunning all the way up and at the top. We were lucky that it was a clear day with no fog. At the top you can do more hikes (we did the ~40 minute flat hike to Maclear's Beacon) and read several educational signs about the Mountain and its history. The trail is well marked and easy to follow. The trail head is well signed and at a small house about a 1-2 min drive beyond the lower cable car station. There is some parking at the trail head or you can park along side the road before it. You can also pay to take the cable car down if you don't feel like hiking back down (if it's open - closes sometimes due to wind)."

The cable car ride to the top of the Table Mountain was interesting with a circular viewing window that rotates as the cable car rises thereby giving a good view to everyone in the cable car. But unless one has been warned or made aware that one should not hold on to the side of the cable car, one could get pulled over as the circular window revolves. The view from the Table Mountain is certainly breathtaking overlooking the city of Cape Town, the Signal Hill, and the Devil's peak. The panoramic view is what one would expect from such a good vantage point. However, the other side of the mountain does not have much to show ro visitors doing the short tour on top of the Table Top Mountain. There is a nice restaurant on the top where one can sip coffee or tea and get some respite from the wind (which could be cold at times). Bring a jacket or a warm sweater."

The nice thing is if you book on line and end up not using the tickets (sometimes inclement weather closes the Cable Car), you can get a refund (there's a time line restriction on refunds so just check your travel dates). You also get a discount by booking on line. The views are amazing and the walking on top is easy. You can go around the entire top or just do a section. We were lucky when we went up as it was fairly clear but we also had the opportunity to see the clouds come over the mountain in the form of a \"table cloth\". We did this on our own - no tour - We took a cab to the site. There are free walking tours (we did not partake) given on top at certain times of the day also so if you're on a budget, you may want to do this tour on your own also and save the tour guides for a different excursion. Dress in layers and it the weather is clear, however you decide to do it - go! You will never forget that feeling of being on top of the world!"

If you like hiking, you can go up or come down via the hiking route (2-3 hours). Otherwise, you can always take the revolving cable car.

The park up top is vast, with plenty of places for great photos. The day we went up it was sunny; there was low cloud too but this cleared as the temperature increased. Allow a good couple of hours 'up top', to walk around and simply enjoy being up there & the stunning vistas. Cafe could do with more tills & staff but, you're on holiday, relax!Would just say that young children need to be watched up top. The health & safety is not at UK standards & you are able to wander off the footpaths to some pretty dangerous locations, so beware, but it is a fabulous experience."

Travelling early would be recommended as we got a parking space really easily and there were no queues. Even the view from the parking lot is great! Cable car up is quick and feels really safe. Impressed with the moving floor which let's everyone get a great view when you are accenting the mountain. The views from the top are spectacular, easily the best thing I've ever done on a Monday morning! An absolute must do if you are in Cape Town."

Although it was busy, they are very quick and efficient at handling crowds and within 15 minutes or so we were ascending the mountain. The views of Cape Town and the water are amazingly beautiful. We did a bit of geo-caching (like treasure hunting using GPS) and also enjoyed drinks and snacks in the very busy mountaintop cafe. Again, even though busy, they just are very organized in handling crowds. There is a well stocked souvenir/gift shop also if that's your thing and the bathrooms are immaculately kept. We took what seems like a gazillion photos and walked lots of the trails while the occasional fast moving misty fog swept over the mountain top. We saw what I believe to be marmots? and small Agama lizards too. In short, Table Mountain is well worth the visit, and to do it justice, you would want to give yourself several hours to explore there. Take a light coat or jacket even if it is nice down below. It is quite a bit cooler on top."

Wait for a day with open skies (no clouds) and go early to cut down on some of the waiting time in the queue. You can check out the Table Mountain Facebook page on updates on if the cable cars is running on the day and how the weather conditions is up there prior to going.There is a lovely self service Restaurant on the mountain but be warned it can get very busy closer to lunch time. It also can get cold up there even in summer time so be prepared for rain/cold and also of course have your sun protection ready. All the facilities are clean and well kept.The walks is amazing and so is the fauna and flora. For the more adventurous there is a route up and down the mountain but definitely only for the more fit and experienced. These hikes can take several hours to complete with weather that can change within minutes.Hope you will enjoy it as much as we did!"

The view is absolutely amazing. Get advanced tickets online, get there early, and bring snacks that will hold you over enough until you can get a real meal. The restaurant at the top is horrible :( Plan for at least 25 minutes standing in line to get down, and don't lose your ticket, you'll have to buy another one for the return trip."

The information that I had read beforehand said that it was a 2 hour, strenuous walk. Boy, was that accurate. It was an extremely strenuous walk as the hike is practically straight up the side of the mountain. Even though I thought I was going to die, the hike took us approximately 1 1/2 hours and I would do it again. It made the view from the top so much better. We spent about 30 minutes on top just walking around, taking pictures, and enjoying the scenery. We ended up taking the cable car down, but if you can handle it, I would certainly suggest walking down. Bring lots of water, plan on being hot on the hike up and cool once you reach the top. The nice thing is, if you hike, you get in for free!"
