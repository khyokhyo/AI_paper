Lily was very quick to respond with a number of options that were substantially cheaper than booking direct with cruise lines. We settled on the Glory Legend at 120 USD per person ( including transfers ) and we were very happy with the result. Having paid a deposit online, Lily met us personally at her agency as we needed to pay the remainder of the money owed for the cruise and like others we were offered cold water and fresh fruit while there. Lily explained the itinerary in detail and provided us with her personal mobile number in case of any issues which was great. We were on the larger of the two vessels operated by Glory Legend. (same company as Pelican) The boat was very well presented, as was the food and there was a tremendous amount of it. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Halong Bay and Lily's Travel receives our highest recommendation. Completely trustworthy and excellent service."

It cost \u00a3100 total. We were staying a half an hour taxi ride away and they even paid for our taxi to get to Old Quarter at the start of the trip. As soon as we got back from Halong Bay we went straight back to Lily's and booked another trip for the following weekend - to Tam Coc this time."

He helped setup all our transportation and tours throughout the area for a very reasonable price.The most amazing part was that he gave us a way to contact him anytime and was beyond patient when I would constantly bother him with questions regarding a bus or city we were in. He always responded extremely quickly and in a very professional manner no matter how many times I seemed to bother him. He really helped make our Vietnam trip a total success.Thanks again for everything Duong!"

Having done a lot of research we realised that it could be a bit 'hit or miss' as to whether we got a good deal or we got 'ripped off'. We read a review on a website which said that Lily's appeared to be a company that provided a good service. It transpires that Lily's is not far from the WIN Hotel, so we went there. Lily was amazing. She booked a really good quality four day trip for us at a good price (and we got a free upgrade on the boat from a cabin to a suite). Nothing was too much trouble and on one occasion when we had to contact her to make a minor adjustment to our itinerary, she responded immediately. She was so efficient, helpful, friendly and offered great value for money that we went back and booked another three day trip to Mai Chau, which was also excellent."

They fed us with a refreshing watermelon (thank you Lily, I love watermelon :)) and saved us from the terrible heat with plenty of water bottles.We ended up to book a two days tour in Halong Bay and a three days trekking in Sa Pa.The Halong bay tour was exactly what we had been told by Lily's, a great cruise through the fabulous descending dragons bay with a lot of different activities, but was the Sa Pa tour that left us speechless. Our guides were Mao and her sister Sue, from the Black Hmong tribe. I really have no words to describe how great this experience was for me and how deeply I felt connected to their land, their culture and their living. I wish I could have spent with them more than just three days. Probably the best experience in over one year of traveling. Thank you Lily and Phan for this amazing opportunity, I will never be able to thank you enough. Say hi to Sue and Mao for me as you have the chance :)"

I was a bit worried as I did all of my booking online and so I was just going off of the reviews here on trip advisor. I must say though that everything was great with Lily. She was quick to respond to emails and she gave me a bunch of different options in different price ranges for Halong Bay and Sapa. The boat we stayed on was great in a wonderful room and she got us an amazing deal on the price. Our trekking in Sapa was one of our highlights as the home stays were great and the trekking was exhausting but beautiful.

It made a tremendous difference that Lily explained and detailed her tours with a high degree of transparency. I suppose the agency prioritises good reviews and recommendations over scale. We booked a Ha Long Bay cruise on Silversea Cruise, and a 2D1N Sapa trekking and home-stay tour through Lily. Both tours went pretty smoothly - it may be good to note that Lily has direct contacts with the many different parties involved which makes troubleshooting much easier. Quality of tours were also reliable for their price range. I found out from a crew member on the cruise that Lily herself goes onto the cruise to audit its standards. Definitely recommended for anyone travelling to Hanoi! Cheers :)"

Everything Thuy told us about the cruise was true, the room, meals,itineary and everything was exactly as expected. Our tour guide, Mr. Kim is also an excellent tour guide, very informative and speaks good english.Through this all, we can see their honesty and profesionalism in dealing with their clients and business. And yes, they keep contact with us to make sure everything is perfect even after the tour. This is exceptional. No other tour agents in my 1.5years of travels has ever done that.

            "review": "Honest advice, no pressure and exceptional after sales service. We were overwhelmed by the number of different travel agencies in Hanoi (including a bit of pressure to book through our guesthouse) and didn't know where to go. We realised quite quickly that despite the million travel agencies, they all book through the same small number of tour operators, for similar prices. Therefore how you should assess travel agencies is the honesty of the advice you're getting and whether you think you can count on them to help you if (or when!) things go wrong. You get both of these with Lily's. We went into Lily's numerous times to book a Sapa tour, a Halong Bay tour and an open bus ticket. Each time we were greeted with huge smiles, more bottles of water than we could carry, fruit and soy beans. At no point did we feel any pressure to buy from here (and we frequently left without booking to discuss which tour we wanted as we wandered around the Old Quarter). We just got good honest advice about the different tours and prices.What particularly makes Lily stand out is her post sales service. We had her whatsapp number and was told we could contact her 'any time of the day or night' for assistance. We needed to do this a few times with the open bus ticket, mainly due to the terrible communication abilities of the bus drivers (not Lily's fault!). Each time Lily was able to answer our questions and sort out our issues. The chances of having at least one issue on the open bus tour are high, and having someone you can contact is very comforting. If you are booking the Sapa tour, make sure you ask for Mao as a guide. She is the most knowledgeable, funny and lovely guide that you could ask for. We enjoyed every minute of our 3 day 2 night trek. She took us on some great routes through the rice fields and around the villages with some very funny and interesting stories. Trekking itself was not too difficult. You will absolutely not go hungry, we ate some amazing home cooked food and it just kept coming! You may also drink more rice wine than you planned....If booking Halong Bay tour we went through Lemon Cruises. Paid a bit more than the other options, but we didn't want a 'party boat', we wanted two nights on a boat giving us one full day on the water and we went a different route to the east of the main Halong Bay Area which was a lot quieter. I can honestly say that the boat was exactly how it looked in the brochures. It was clean, comfortable and the shower was one of the best we had had while travelling. Hot rain shower. Can't fault them on anything. Know that as it takes 4 hours to get to Halong Bay from Hanoi, even the 2 day 1 night option is only just about 24 hours on the boat itself.Lily mentioned that she was trying to set up agencies elsewhere in Vietnam. I hope she does - it would help increase the customer service everywhere!"

In the evening Mao treated us with a lot of \"happy water\". The tracks are very interesting as you are walking through rice fields and meeting locals. The best thing was that we met only 1 group of tourist(4 persons) in whole day. All guides spoke sufficient English and were very helpful.

Their service was very friendly and they explained all options our budget and time frame allowed (we talked to them via email and it worked great but going in there and having a conversation was even better and they offered to keep our excess luggage for us during the trips). We ended up booking two trips that fit us perfectly and had a great time at a very good price. We took the \"less touristic\" tour in Sapa which was really that: not many other tourists, a knowledgable guide from the local tribe, awesome local food and a rustic (not to say basic) home stay. We booked a trip to Halong bay with Fantasea cruise which was also very nice, well planned and great for what we wanted. It was also great that we could reach the agency via telephone and whatsapp at all times and they helped to calm us as our pick up was late. The only things that could be improved are very insignificant but overall the experience we had with the agency was so good that we feel this could make it perfect: it would be helpful to have a printed itinerary of what happens when and where you're supposed to be picked up (and by whom) and where you're staying would be great for the Sapa trip (we ended up waiting at the bus stop in Sapa for our guide for a while which wasn't bad but we didn't know anything about the next steps so we felt lost until we got the chance to call the agency). And also, the Sapa trip included \"pick up from the hotel\" which turned out to be a guy on a scooter. We had to run crisscross through the city following the guy while he picked up more people until we stopped very close to where we stayed again to be put into a minivan made for 15 people; only we were 20 people plus luggage. We only drove like that for a very short while and walking shouldn't be a problem for someone who books trekking in Sapa but it just wasn't the best \"hotel pick up\" experience.But again, apart from these minor issues, we had a great experience booking with the agency and a lot of fun on our trips.

She was also transparent about which parts of the trip were for sure going to happen and which were tentative depending on weather conditions (rather than other agencies, which promised the moon and back and made me very skeptical). My friend and I picked the middle price tier for a great price and we had a great tour, no complaints. Chung (from Fantasea) was our guide he was great, we got to kayak through caves, see the \"surprise cave\", go squid-fishing at night, and learned how to make spring rolls. As a vegetarian I was also very concerned I wouldn't have good food to eat for two days, but Chung and Fantasea arranged for plenty of vegetarian food (more than I could eat and a variety) at each meal.

At the end we were 12, and at Mao's place even 16. That was not exactly the experience that we expected. The homestay is very basic. Since we were 16 guests it did not really felt like a homestay. And in my opinion, when they want to have so many guests at once, there should be more than one toilet and one shower. Especially at these prices. So they are better off keeping it small. Also the drinks are overpriced. 0,5l water for 10000 is too much for what you pay for a bed. The hikes were very nice, with great views and good guides. So it was really sad to see that two of the 3 guides actually seemed to be no guides but just wanted to sell stuff at the end of the trip. If they show their offer and ask if we want to buy anything - that is totally ok. But they surrounded us and didn't stopped asking us to buy something, so it felt very awkward and bad to say no for the 20th time, sitting at your destination and trying to relax from the trip. That is exactly what you do not expect when booking a not-so-cheap all inclusive tour. I would have loved to give a good tip instead.Mao is a good and fun person and the overall experience was still great, also because we were very lucky with our nice group and also with the weather."

We're mainly students so we booked a budget tour to Ha Long Bay for 2 days 1 night. Lily, was really helpful and nice to us. Always smile, good patience and explained clearly to us every thing about the tour even we just booked a budget tour with her. At that time, we were lack of budget so we thought a budget tour was OK. But actually we regretted about it. You should never book a budget tour. The tour guide is rude and the food is good but not enough serving for all of us. Ha Long bay is beautiful. Lily was really nice. Trust me, you will want to book a tour with this lady. She is the first person I want to contact if I want to travel in Vietnam. Thank you Lily!"

Lily and one of her assistants gave us water and fed us fruit as they went through all our options with us, they speak excellent English and were very honest about what you get within each price range. We explained we only have 15 days with our visa exemption and Lily recommended which packages would suit us for the trips we want to do in the limited time we have and even went through day by day on the calendar how we might want to spend the rest of our days heading south through Vietnam until the day we leave :) very helpful.We booked a mid range priced Halong Bay trip which was excellent, pick up and drop of right back to the agency (which was the same road we were staying) and also a 2 day Sapa trek (also with pick up) which included one night bus stay and a home stay. Mao was an amazing host, completely hilarious and so kind and accommodating. We ate until I genuinely thought I might burst and then out came the happy water...I would 100% ask for her, her and her family are wonderful!Lily enquired prices and means to getting to our next destination of Hoi An for us too and after a few phone calls we decided to get the night bus and flights were too expensive.I would recommend anyone wanting any information regarding trips, transport or any information at all really, to pay Lily a visit. They will give honest advice and information and at no point do you ever feel obliged to agree to anything, you can come and go and compare as you please :) thanks for making our trip amazing!"

We were lured in by Lily's friendly face but didn't want to commit to anything too soon. She was fine about us just exploring options and was happy providing us with prices to think about with no pressured selling. She provided us with snacks and water as she rang companies for our Halong Bay tour. We went away and thought about it before returning the next day to book with other members of her staff who also couldn't do enough for us. They undercut any other prices we got and were honest with us about the different boats and buses to Hue available. We booked both with them there and then and everything else ran smoothly. Tours were as described and pick up from Lily's both times were so easy. Great staff who I'd recommend to any travellers to get an honest deal."

            "review": "Great customer service. Lily is all about customer service - that much is obvious by all of the reviews on here and I can add to them! We started with a tour to Sapa, which ended up being one of the highlights of my Vietnam trip... The three day two night tour took us there by Hung Thanh sleeper bus - very good quality, even if the members of this company can be very rude and shouty - you seem to get that on every bus in Vietnam! We had three days of trekking, walking, interacting with the Black Hmong people in the village and stayed with the amazing Mao and her family. Such a good experience and well worth the money - which wasn't as much as other companies were selling tours for anyway! Our second two night three day trip we (6 of us) booked whilst in Sapa to Halong Bay... Now this didn't exactly go as planned but that could be partly our fault for booking over the phone - we ended up on a boat called Ha Long Party Cruises after definitely not wanting a party boat or anything similar to the Castaways tour... We were told that there were two different tours to Ha Long Bay, one for young people with happy hours and one for older people, but that they were largely the same. We booked the younger person tour. I would say that the majority of the people on the party boat were just young people not necessarily looking for a massive party, but the whole tour was geared up around getting everyone wasted on the buy 4 get one free happy hour by the host... And unless you state that you want to see the features of Ha Long bay that you see in the brochures, and have all of items on the itinerary, you might not get them! Saying all of that, we ended up having a good time nonetheless and decided to make the trip our own (and not about the party boat and arranged drinking games), and had a few beers and met some cool people. The Freedom island is really cool to chill out on though...the whole trip would have been that much better if you weren't forced into the drinking. But as I mentioned before, it is probably our fault for not getting all of the information and booking the party tour, not Lily's! The last point is regarding the amazing service of Lily. We were at the bus station in Sapa where the bus manager for Hung Thanh wouldn't let us get onto the bus, because we apparently didn't have a booking, when I'm sure that we did as Lily had booked it for us. The manager was very shouty insisting he had no space on his bus for us, so we rang Lily. Lily then rang the manager straight away and we were all of a sudden allowed onto the bus, no problems. Ive no idea what she did but the response time was amazing, avoiding a bad situation for us. We (three of us) also booked a Hung Thanh open bus ticket through Lily to travel south with 7 stops. This turned out to only be Hung Thanh bus for 1/7 of the buses and the only one with a toilet.., after choosing Hung Thanh and paying extra for their nice buses we were a bit frustrated, however Lily was very apologetic as we had booked this through her even though it probably wasn't her fault as she thought that Hung Thanh's partners further down the country were reliable and of the same standard. As we weren't happy, Lily refunded us some of the money that we paid for the better bus, which she definitely didn't have to do, I think this was a good show of her amazing customer service and I was very grateful for this! Overall I'd definitely recommend Lily as your travel agent for Vietnam, she is a very nice person, very professional and always willing to help!"

            "review": "Efficiency and honesty to the max. I travelled from South Africa with a group of 2 friends to vietnam for 8 days. I read about Lily's Travel agency on the below forum. I established communication with Lily via email. I had received quotations from other hanoi travel agencies. Lily's was by far the cheapest. I had specific itenerary and hotels that I had chosen which Lily included. What astounded me was the degree of honesty and transparency of Lily. Her quotes had itemised billing which in most cases was cheaper than the cheapest internet deal I could secure for each item. I bothered her with over 71 emails which were responded to with a turn around time of no longer than 48 hours. I was further surprised by the fact that Lily did not require full payment on confirmation of the tour. I had to make a small fractional deposit. The other amazing thing was that she never pressurized you into taking any option of her tours.On arrival in hanoi transfer was awaiting with name board. I had seemless check in. At 2 of the 3 hotels I had requested I received a much appreciated upgrade. On arrival in hanoi I made the remainder of payment transfer in cash US dollars. Not only did Lily further explain itinerary and made amendments that were cost and logistically optimal, she also exchanged USD to dong at the most competitive rate I could find.My Halong Bay cruise and transfers, plus overnight sleeper train were exactly what I requested and at a phenomenal price. When a domestic flight had a change of time (brought forward by 7 hours), Lily went to extensive lengths to contact and notify me of this. Be aware that this is a frequent occurrence with domestic flights in Vietnam. One of our tours in hoi an was cancelled due to inclement weather. Lily made us aware of this and refunded the full amount in cash from the hotel reception we stayed at. Another tour was not logistically possible in hue due to the late arrival of our train. Lily gave all the options including a private tour which was pricey. She went on to recommend we take our own non organised tour as all sites in hue were easily reachable. This is a rarity wit tour operators, who often pressurize you take options where they receive commissions. Lily is always available and furnishes you with her whatsapp number which provides an easy means of communication for clarifying arrangements pick up times etc.You can always be guaranteed to receive a warm reception from Lily and her team. They go above and beyond their line of duty. They stored our large luggage on 2 occasions and always offered mineral water and peanuts whenever we passed by the agency. Also for a transfer not included, one of the staff members manged to signal a taxi and explain our destination in vietnamese. I am not sure the name of Lily's assistant who was on night duty on 29 March. She was very friendly and spoke excellent English and stayed passed closing time while we waited for our transfer.The only constructive criticism I would have to offer is that on itineraries Lily should provide a detailed description of sites visited on day tours and the day's schedule for OCD people like myself who are major planners and would not like to duplicate visiting sites included on the subsequent days tours during free time in the city,In conclusion, I have taken many 5 star organised customized holiday tours, Lily's Travel far exceeds any other tour operator I have used. Do not be detracted and think that Lily can only organise short excursions or day trips for the \"backpacker type\". They are phenomenal at organising full itineraries with internal transfers, 4 star accommodation and city tours.Its a pity tripadvisor has a maximum of 5 stars. Lily's travel deserves 7 stars for price and efficiency."

Look no further and do not be skeptical of the other stellar reviews of Lily's. They are totally accurate. In the land of scams, Lily's agency is a true gem. The women working with Lily speak excellent English, they are kind and go above and beyond to help you choose your adventure at a fair price. If you are booking with Lily's I must insist that you do Sapa trekking. As specially to be with Mao. Mao leads a homestay in her H'mong village. The experience was one of the most special things I have ever done in my life. Search online for Mao and you will find she has admirers all of the globe. Mao's homestay is the best by a long shot. Her house is well equip for guests and on her walls are drawings and photos from her many guests. She takes you hiking far into the mountains to see hidden views and villages. The food she cooks was the best I've had in Vietnam. You stay up late chatting with her and sipping rice wine that she calls happy water. By the end of the trip you will not want to leave her! I recommend you spend two nights with Mao to take advantage of the long hike options. Do the sleeper bus instead of the train, which is hear is so rocky you can't even sleep. The bus is faster and cheaper and you make less connections- lily will tell you that also."

We had firstly good tour to Halong bay and we thought that we also have great exprience for the trip down south of Vietnam that is so called as open bus tickets. We have paid $75 bucks for 6 stop open bus which should be just half price if we hadnt traveled at Tet holidays. The point here is, we accepted to pay double price for the open bus to make sure that we have tickets during the crazy time in Vietnam ( Tet holiday) and for many times we asked the lady if we can do the open bus and if we can have spaces on the bus for sure and she said \" sure, sure...\" and then we booked the bus without knowing that we would have nightmare ahead. The first stop was in Hue. For the beginning of the trip, we had spaces but the bus stopped many times to get the new customers and many people had to lie down on the floor and we feel that there was almost no air in the bus anymore. We couldnt go to the toilet even it is mentioned to be available. The bus driver was very rude and continued to gathering the new customers. It took us 15 hours from Hanoi to Hue which was supposed just to be 12 hours. The really nightmare was on the trip from Hoian to Nha trang. We confirmed the bus 2 days before but lastly we didnt have any spaces on the bus and they said we had to wait for 2 more days for the next bus. Our visas running out and we have to take the local bus instead of and we had to pay $30 more for that even we paid for the open bus. We couldnt contact with the Lily agecy and lastly we didnt used the rest of the open bus.So dont book the open bus with this agency. It is absolutely not worth."

Each time I came back, she knows who I am and enthusiastically waves at me. She is incredibly kind and provides excellent services; always giving me water and often guava, mango, water melon or other kinds of fruits. The trips I organized through her were unforgettable and well organized. I am looking forward to my next trip to Hanoi and to stay at her new hostel!Daisy"

Both tours (sapa 3 days 2 nights and Halong Bay 2 days 1 night) were completely as described and noticeably on the cheaper side of price quotes in Hanoi travel agencies (and I did cross check). Apart from accurate good deals, Lily made my traveling in Vietnam and especially Hanoi, feeling very secure. When you roam the streets of Hanoi, you instantly find yourself struggling through tons of business offers regarding your trip, from food stands, through transportation to high end packages and accommodation. You will surely get ripped off. Not at Lily's. When you sit in her welcoming office you feel it almost on the spot. You read her moto \"Trust is south more than gold\" and you know you're in for hands. She and her caring staff are some of friendliest people I met in Vietnam, always looking after you, offering you help and making you feel at home. I remember 2 events that made the service from Lily that special:1. After visiting Sapa I came to her and felt sick that day with a sore throat. When Lily heard, she immediately when on to find a relief for me, ending up buying me some tablets to ease the pain! 2. Lily gives you her phone number to contact her in case of a problem, and I did have one, only it was in 6am, and I was in Nha Trang, hundreds of kilometers away from her agency. She didn't care about the hour, and helped me on the spot. It was really beautiful to experience.I highly recommend Lily's travel agency to anyone who goes in and around Hanoi."

She was on time and she was waiting for us at the lobby. The lunch was very good. We stopped at a very small village and we ate at a local restaurant, which was very nice! I really recommend her as your tour guide in Sapa. Lily's, our tour agent, was very helpful all the time. She provided me with all the information that I needed for my trip including recommendations on what villages to go. She replied to my messages very fast. I really recommend her company to book tours and if you are visiting Sapa ASK for MAO! :) She is the best! Visited January 11-12, 2016"

We booked a 5 day tour(3 day hiking, 2 nights homestay, 2 nights nightbus) to Sapa for trekking through the rice terraces. We went over night with the nightbus from Hanoi to Sapa. Early in the morning we arrived and the girl who guided us picked us up from the station to have some breakfast. It was also possible to leave the luggage there and only take a daypack (One of the family members brought it up to the homestay). While hiking it was possible to ask lots of questions about their culture and their way of living. What I liked the most was that we always had the chance to decide how we wanna hike: easy, medium, difficult or less touristic, more touristic. Nevertheless it is really helpful to have proper hiking shoes, espacially when it was raining. During the night we stayed at the homestay with the family. It was a really nice one. We felt really welcome. I always have the sentence in my head the woman said: \"When there is no one sleeping here, it is boring!\" Not to forget their food was awesome (especially the Springrolls, after two weeks of Vietnam still the best!). After dinner we played some funny drinking games with them and lots of homemade ricewine ( also called as \"Happy Water\"). This is why i absolutely can recomend this agency to book a tour there!!!"

As we had only 4 weeks for Southeast Asia and wanted to spent 2 weeks in Laos we looked for an option to see at least some parts of northern Vietnam.Lily's agency offered the best package that included a three day trip for Ha Long Bay (however instead of staying in a hotel the second night in hindsight we would have taken the bungalow on monkey island instead) and a two day trekking tour with one Homestay night in Sapa.They also took care of all travel arrangements (Hanoi - Ha Long Bay - Hanoi - Sapa (by night train) - Dien Bien Phu (where we crossed the border to Laos).In total we can't complain about arrangements and service the only downside was the second night of the Ha Long Bay Trip. The hotel in Cat Ba is ok, rooms are spacious but the town is nothing special at all the bungalow option on a rather lonely island seems to be the way better option for a couple. Pure nature and direct access to the sea. So we have been told the hotel would be the more comfortable way, but the bungalow is the more romantic and will longer be remembered as our fellow traveler told us who opted for the bungalow.So in total 4 out of 5 stars!"

Secondly, when we arrived at her travel agency we were blown away by her patience,politeness,efficiency and helpfulness even her employees offered the same standards of service. Lily's travel really went an (alot) extra miles for us, from offering the best prices (I did checked around) to getting us cabs and even paid the cab fare from her own pocket (though is not alot but it is the thoughts the counts) and even offer us recommendations out of her scope in Hanoi. At first I was skeptical of whether will turn out to be scam but rest assured Lily's travel is the best Hanoi could offer, we witnessed it ourselves!

As for the village tour, the local food at a Vietnamese family's house is simply mouth-watering and very enjoyable. The Vietnamese way of life is very simple with many home manufacturing industries like the home made wine and the only silk factory left in the village.Lots of pictures to be taken and the coach ride is very pleasant as well, with only 7-9 people in the whole group.

I was not sure yet how to travel through the country and they suggested the Open Bus Ticket. I took the sleeping bus from Hanoi to Hue and I find it a good, cheap option. If you're not too tall, the bus is comfortable enough and you get some sleep, the roads have been redone recently so no problem with that. Regarding the prices I think they are really OK too. I'm not a good bargainer and still think I got a decent deal.You can reach the agency through whatsapp as well, which was very convenient for me to confirm when I would want to take the bus."

Trip was as described and we even got upgraded to a nicer cruise ship on the day. Price was very reasonable and didn't meet anyone in the ship who paid less than us for same package. (our hotel quoted us $60 dearer per person for a similar package). Also booked overnight train to Hue here and lily let us leave our bags in the shop as we had a few hours to kill before leaving Hanoi. Also recieved complimentary bottles of water every time we called to the shop. Which was three times in total. Would definitely recommend this place."

They can plan for any budget and help organize your valuable time in the Hanoi and surrounding area. I did an overnight trip to Ha Long Bay and another trip to Sapa. She also arranged pick up from the airport and Hanoi hotel. If you just ask for what you want and advise on your budget (low, medium, high) she will provide options and then accommodate your wishes. If you want something changed, Lily will discuss and adjust accordingly - she does not push you into anything. She also will store your luggage in case you want to do an overnight trip and return later for your bag.... AND can use restrooms as needed.She is very friendly and her staff is great. Always time to chat, provides bottled waters, and sometimes food if she has extra. You can use her office to wait between tours, recharge your electronics, and just hang out. What a great experience with Lily!!!! Really a friendly person and outstanding service.She really made my first days in Vietnam perfect."

After being in Hanoi for a few days and getting scammed left and right by various people, we were wary of using a travel agency to book our trip to Halong Bay. My research of reputable travel agencies online led me to Lily's, and I'm so happy to say that all of the rave reviews of this agency are accurate. Lily and her team are kind, welcoming, and honest. They give you useful information and careful explain your options, as many times as you ask, and do not pressure you to buy or book anything. We visited Lily's a few times. The first time, we went to gather information about the many tour companies in Halong Bay and told Van that we would go back to our hotel to think about our options and come back later to potentially book something. We expected her to try to pressure us to book then and there, give us the \"I have a special price for you\" pitch, but she gave us a genuine smile and said \"Ok, no problem! There is much to consider!\" It was so nice to be able to take our time with our decision. We went back the next day and booked our lovely tour (with Fantasea Cruise) with Lily herself. The package we booked was exactly as she had described, and the price was right. The third time we went back to Lily's was just to ask a question about the best way to get from the De Nang train station into Hoi An. The team at Lily's had earned our trust and we felt we would get reliable information. To our delight, they did not try to sell us a package or tickets to anything, but merely suggested that we hire a taxi when we arrive in De Nang, gave us a guideline for how much it should cost, and recommended that we try to share a taxi with another couple on our train. How refreshing to not have someone trying to take advantage of us, and just being helpful!Thank you, Lily's, for your excellent help!"

The junk gives you luxurious experience as well, it looks brand new compared to the other junks we saw. The food is fantastic and the staff treatment is nice; always handing over fresh towels during tour, because its pretty humid so it refreshes you. We'll definitely be back to Halong bay- we should try the overnight or 3 days 2 nights cruise, you'll appreciate it more! I will still avail Lily Travel agency's service next time and would recommend to my friends. Two thumbs up! Thanks for making our Halong Bay experience unforgettable."

When we got to the cruise, it seemed as if we were the only ones with correct expectations, as many of our co-travelers were unpleasantly surprised. It was an average cruise in a beautiful setting, so in all it was a fine trip.

She arrived at 8.10am, the same time the tour guide reached, just in time for me to put down my bags in Lily's shop and leave.When I was back from my Halong Bay tour, I was preparing to pick up my bags, take a quick shower and catch a night bus to Sapa at 9.45pm. But to my horror, the shop was closed, this was at 8.50pm, and I gave Lily a few phone calls, but she never pick them up but instead she dismissed my call. I knocked on the gates, but the family do not want to open the door and they couldn't understand me. After a help from a lady working at the opposite shop to do some translation, the family made a call to Lily, and she instantly picked up the call. I told Lily that my bag was in her shop, she just said \"ohh~\" and asked me to pass the phone back to them. This was when the gate finally opened, and it was 9.30pm. I went through 40 minutes in panic state just to get my bags. What if I missed my bus? I think Lily certainly does not care about it, but will be more than willing to book another trip for you, you pay.

Also, I told her that I was going to be living in Hanoi and 2 minutes later she called a friend of hers' who later met me to discuss possible employment.A few days after our trip to Bai Tu Long Bay we also wanted to go to a place called Dam Long. This isn't really well known and basically it is 100% for Vietnamese tourists. There are no buses there, no tours for foreigners but my friend and I really wanted to go. So in the end, at no cost at all she sat us down for half an hour and informed us as to how we could manage to get a bus there. On the morning we left, not too sure if we were keen to try and tackle the regional public bus system, we gave Lily a call and asked about a private car (at SUPER late notice, one hour before we were to leave). She organised this, gave us a really great price and in an hour had someone waiting at the front of our hotel to take us where we wanted to go.In the end, Hanoi, like so many places in the world, has a booming tourism industry. This means it can be very difficult to attain honest information and most importantly, a good price and a great experience. After my friend and I's experience with Lily, I can definitely assure that you will get peace of mind organising your travels with her!Thanks so much Lily!Dylan & Lau"

Lily's was the best value for money for the tours out of all the travel agencies we visited in Hanoi, and I would definitely recommend booking with her. She was very welcoming every time we went in to discuss our tours, offered us water etc and was happy to explain anything we needed answers to. She even let us leave our luggage at the office while we were away on our tour of Halong Bay. The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is that when we arrived at the office to drop our bags off and get the transfer to Halong there was no one there to take our bags. A friend of Lily's came up from a shop further down the road to show us where we could leave our belongings, however we would have like to have been told in advance as we were a bit worried leaving all of our things with someone different! It wasn't a big issue, and our only negative comment about our whole experience, but you're bound to worry when everything you own is in the hands of someone you've never met!"

Lily was really reassuring and it's clear from all these fantastic reviews that she is as honest as she claims! We explained to get exactly what we were looking for - mid range budget, quiet and relaxed with no partying. And we were so lucky - we ended up with only 6 of us on a boat that could host 24! That said, it was such a beautiful boat and more people would not have been a problem. It was the Monkey Island tour and the pictures in the brochure look exactly like the real thing. The food was ex excellent and monkey island itself was quiet and idyllic. There's also a perfect spot to watch the sunset. If you're worrying about finding the right deal in Hanoi just head to Lily! :)Thank you to Lily for a better experience than we even imagined!"

The only negative thing would be the hotel - Grand View Sapa- where we all (including many other tour groups) met out guide, it was not a nice place, but I think it is where a lot of tours meet so can't really be helped in some cases. We also booked our trip to Halong Bay with Lily. Got a good trip for a 4star 3D2N cruise. Highly recommend using lily! She and her husband were both lovely to deal with!"

She's absolutely charming - every time we went in she offered us water and fruit - practically insisting we took some. Very hospitable!Advice she offered was always good - honest, and we both trusted her. Even when it wasn't something she was selling - i.e. the next part of our trip. We'd booked train tickets ourselves at the station and she offered information on onward travel (local buses etc). We booked a Halong bay cruise through her, 134 U.S.D for three days, two nights on the boat - so mid range, and for what we paid it was great. We've heard mixed things about these cruises, some people seem to have less than pleasant experiences so were a little apprehensive but we couldn't have asked for much more really. We left out main luggage with her for ease, definitely a good idea as there wasn't a huge amount of space on either the minibus or the boat. She offered to let us leave it with her for our sapa trip too which we'd booked independently. In my boyfriend's words: a thoroughly pleasant experience! Wouldn't have any hesitation in booking through her again."

She might not be the cheapest agent out there but she has to be one of the best. We were tempted by the cheaper tours but were wary that they would have been of a lower standard. We trusted Lily instead and we were very happy with what we got. We even found that other people on the tours had been charged more by other agents and the hostel we stayed at were charging considerably more. The Halong Bay tour was good. We did 1 night two days and the standards were good as was the food. We booked onto the non-party tour and had such a great mix of people to get to know rather than just drinking the night away. Having said that, the one night tour does feel a bit rushed so a longer tour might be a good option if you have the time. Sapa was also really good (but very cold). The guide we had (called Na) was awesome and the homestay was amazing. We had some of our best food of our two months in Asia while there and it was cooked over the fire by the family. The hotels in Sapa aren't great so if you are doing one night, make sure it's in the homestay and even if you are doing two nights it wouldn't be a bad idea to stay in a homestay for both of possible. Lily herself is very genuine and easy to trust and she was so very helpful whenever we needed anything. Even if it didn't have anything to do with the tours we had booked. Every time we went in she was offering us free water and fruit. Book with Lily and you won't be disappointed."

The trekking in Sapa was flawless, the cruise was amazing and we had some problems going to Hoi An, but we called her and she solved everything right away, things thats werrnt even her fault.Lily is very lovely and is always worried about her custumers. Her prices may not be the cheapest but for sure are not the most expensive, you can be sure about quality. In the cruise in halong bay we were the ones paying the cheapest price :)Thank you so much for all the care and support, Lily!!!"

I used Lily's Travel Agency for 3 services during my stay in Hanoi: a trip to Halong Bay, a trip to Mai Chau Valley and a hotel recommendation between the two trips. In short: The tours were really good, but the hotel (which supposedly is run by Lily's friend) pulled the most classic \"Hanoi Hotel Scam\" on me, which was very annoying. I'll explain it later.First of all, the trip to Halong Bay was very nice. It was not the exact trip as I was promised, different ship and different itinerary. I think this is just something you have to suck up if you order through an agent. Even if they tell you what to expect about the trip, it's hard for them to control, since they don't operate the tours themselves. I really enjoyed the trip and I believe I got a really good deal. Even though the ship was very old, it was still very nice, clean and had a great staff, that were not too pushy.Second of all, the trip to Mai Chau Valley was really nice as well. I really recommend it. This was the highlight of my week in Vietnam. The tour was really well organised and the deal I got from Lily was very good. Actually, other people on the trip paid almost 70 % (!!!) more for the trip than I paid Lily! So watch out if you go somewhere else.Finally, there was the hotel I was recommended between my stays. Lily's \"friend\" showed me a really nice room that I reserved for when I returned back from Halong Bay. I instinctively knew that it would happen and it did. When I got back, they pulled the classical Hanoi hotel scam, which was really annoying. The scam is so common in Hanoi. It works like this: The hotel will sell you a really nice deal, either online or IRL. When you show up to check in, they will tell you a lie about why they had to move you to their \"sister\" hotel or whatever. In my case they told me a story about someone who was sick in the room. It was so obvious what was going on. As I was tired after the trip and didn't want to walk around to find another place (they know this is always the case) I accepted the horrible room they gave me in another hotel, but I truly regret it. I regret giving the scammers my money. Anyways. It's impossible for me to know if Lily knows about how this works, but it's hard for me to believe that she never heard about it. If she wants to keep these good reviews and not disappoint her customers, I would suggest that she talks with her friend and explains that this is not acceptable, before sending more people to their hotel.I was really happy about the trips, especially when I realised how good a deal I got, but I can't give a 5 star rating because of the annoying hotel scam that they pulled on me. Come on. We have the internet now and we all know about this!"

And then we just handed money to her assistant 1 night before the trip & had just a brief chance to see her personally just before the trip commenced.Absolutely satisfied with the pricing given from start, I really appreciate when agents earn their part & reputation honest way instead of hoping to cheat on unprepared visitors. To be fair, I must note that Dao's agency which I spoke with too gave me a very slightly better price (just 10$), but Lily was first to offer the option (which was enough fro me not to cancel), but also, she was so kind to reserve our trip without deposit, which we simply couldn't do online at that moment, based on just my strong promise that we would show up & pay the day before.

They are really very prompted in attending to your emails and also our many times of last minute enquiries in details. Not even that, they have saved our both life on one of the nights stay in Hanoi. We are trapped in a very difficult situation where we do not know who to reach out to in a foreign country and we managed to reach them through facebook messages. They are so superhero that they have saved us by arranging a driver to us so fast that it was within 5 mins! We find it so comforting to know that we still have them to trust on and they are really worth to kept as friends always! Thank you so much BC Family. We really do enjoy our stay with you. It's a truly blessing to have you as our agent for our backpacking round the Vietnam!Hope to see you again!Cheers,Joanna"

People there are really helpful and extremely friendly. We had booked several tours at BC such as: trip to Sapa and Halong, and all of them are great: good tour guides, various cuisines from different region in Vietnam, and the prices are reasonable. Especially, dorms are so tidy and comfortable and always well-served. BC family makes our trip great and memorable. Thank you \u2013 BC Family for all your kind support."

The tour under APT Travel was good, the tour guide provide good services and able to speak good English. Please aware that if you want to book bus ticket from Sapa to Hanoi, choose other bus company, as we had 10 foreigners were drop off 3km away from Hanoi Old Quarter, the experience was unpleasant, you might walk from Sapa town to bus station around 20-30mins, choose the reliable bus company or mini bus, as there are so many buses is going to Hanoi with same price."

It's right in the old quarter and very close to Hoan Kiem lake, but on a quiet side street. The beds are comfortable, the bathroom is adequate and the lockers are large and under the beds for easy use. The family are very hospitable and the mother cooks great Vietnamese food at a reasonable price. One of their tours is a visit to the family home where you will be taken round the local market and then taught how to cook what's available there."

They were knowledgeable and patient, answered any questions we could ask.

Both spoke superb English and were easy to understand. Both guides were experts at getting us through the crowds when possible, but without skipping anything we should see. The tours were well balanced with hard facts and interesting tidbits of information.

We would recommend without hesitation these two tours and BC Family Tour to all of my friends. A highlight of our trip."

The homestay is small and cosy, and is located centrally in old Hanoi, right where all the action is. Everyday the BC familymembers go out to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner and you have the opportunity to tag along for some really nice company and to take advantage of their knowledge of the local food scene. I'd like to thank Denis, Sam, Daisy and Luxia for be being so nice to be around and making my stay in Hanoi such a great experience!"

They were not only able to get me a room almost immediately at a partner hotel (which was a very nice place), but they were more than helpful in offering advice and helping me arrange transportation around Hanoi. Unfortunately, I never had the time to participate in their group activities (which range from tours to having dinner with locals and travelers, alike), but I could see that the other travelers going through BC Family were having a wonderful time. Next time I am in Hanoi I will certainly be getting in contact with BC Family."

BC Family let us leave all our bags at their offices so we wouldn't have to carry them around.The Snake village was definitely an experience that we are glad we did.All 50 of the emails that was exchanged back and forth was definitely worth it.

Luckily, they offered me a food tour at night, starting at 5pm. We rode our motorbike up to Long Bien bridge and tried some grilled sweet potatoes and corn. They sure tasted nice in a cold winter night. I was really impressed with the view from the bridge, life around the river was so different from that of the city. The food I liked best was rice crust, served with a special kind of shrimp sauce. I have never tasted something even the slightest similar to that, truly unforgettable."

Eight days is not a long enough time to enjoy all the tourism areas of Vietnam, so I had to focus on just Hanoi and Da Nang. However, everything I experienced was of the best. I cannot forget the cold atmosphere and bright sunlight in the early winter of Hanoi, the misty mystical Sword Lake, and the hubbub at the Old Quarter. Da Nang was even more amazing with blue beaches, white sand, green mountains, sacred holy temple and breathtaking view from the cable car. BC really provided an excellent service, because whenever something unexpected happened, we called them and received an almost immediate support. At the Old Quarter, I was accompanied by a volunteer of BC who showed around! Hanoi was the most impressive to me."

For example, Bun Bo Nam Bo (a delicious rice noodle dish with beef, fresh herbs and other delicious ingredients) and egg coffee.

Chairs were reclining seats and spacious and we were also given snacks and water and had two rest stops break during the 6 hours ride. The only mishap for me was, when heading back to Hanoi from Sapa, they changed my ride with another company and I have no idea what was happening. Instead of the bus, they put me in the front seat of a van with others. I wouldn't have had a problem but the front seats weren't that comfortable and wasn't reclining seats. Since it was a 6 hour trip, it was hard to endure for the body. I'm thinking they ran out of seats with their bus but they should at least have the courtesy to explain the situation instead of just asking me to jump into another unknown van in the last minute.

We weren't sure what to expect when taking a bus labeled 'limo' on a 5.5 hour ride to Sapa, but the seats were very comfortable, and they have blankets and neck pillows in case you want to take a nap. The bus stops about every 90 minutes for a bathroom/snack break. They do provide a bottle of water and a couple of prepackaged snacks for during your ride as well. The driver was definitely driving safely, and we did not feel uncomfortable at any time with the speed or style of driving. Also, access to Wifi while on the bus is a definite plus as well!"

The return journey which leaves at 5pm, a bottle of water and a snack are provided.There are 2 stops along the way with plenty of time for something to eat, and a visit to the Happy Room.Along with the driver there is also an 'assistant' that makes sure you know which seat you're in (allocated seats), and will sort out taxis for you if you need.The road is mostly freeway, until you get about an hour from Sapa, then it becomes quite windy (think Great Ocean Road, but uphill). Can be a bit scary - but all of Vietnam roads are really. The drivers do seem to take risks that we wouldn't normally even think of doing, but again - that's Vietnam. I wasn't concerned for my safety or anything like that.If i ever go back to Sapa i would do it again.Apparently there will be a new main road to Sapa built in the next couple of years which will make it a lot easier...."

Having heard of people's dislike of the overnight train to Sapa, in the months before departing for Vietnam I began to investigate other affordable means of travel there. Despite my travel agent being concerned about this mode of travel, due to heavy traffic and steep, narrow, winding roads I read other people's reports on Trip Advisor and felt comfortable booking with this bus company.(Roads have been improved in recent years and only the last section of the trip was windy). I am happy to say my research was pleasantly rewarded as we found this bus very comfortable and the 5 hour bus trip allowed us to enjoy the changing countryside. The bus itself was quite luxurious, equipped with reclining seats and free wifi. We were also issued with bottles of water and a snack pack. We stopped at two service centres along the way for short breaks (be prepared to have toilet paper handy as sometimes they run out). I would certainly recommend this bus service as an economical and comfortable means of getting to and from Sapa."

Don't expect 1st class and be prepared to accept 4th class (yes it does exist on this train). Read the conditions of travel carefully before booking because most of the 'sleepers' are in shared compartments and you could be lumbered alongside beer drinking or chain smoking locals who don't realise they are in a sleeper carriage. It is well worth the extra Dong to travel in a twin cabin. Be wary of bottles of wine given to you by the guard as part of your fare? The guard will return at some point for payment at an exaggerated price. If you open the bottle, you pay. If you want a drink take it with you. The small food carts in the station prior to departure are safe to buy from, contrary to the warnings issued by the guards (they want to sell to you!)."

Several times we were told to wait and when I asked if they could give us more information the staff members shouted as us, ignored us and one of the staff members even put his hand to my face. After a lot of frustration we were finally allocated seats on the bus but the staff members on board continued to treat us rudely and didn't offer us services they offered to other guests (such as helping to book taxis).For this reason I would not reccomend this company to anyone.

Unfortunately, the bus driver was a maniac. I have spent a total of 7 weeks travelling in Vietnam over the past four years on a variety of vehicles (buses, vans, cars, trains, boats) and have never felt unsafe until this bus ride. We had witnessed a bus roll off the road and down a hillside on the previous day while trekking so it is obviously not always safe. The road from Sapa to Lao Cai is newer but it is a winding mountain road. The driver sped excessively, tailgated, honked, passed unsafely, and generally intimidated anyone and anything in his way including other large tour buses. During our rest/food stop outside Hanoi, which we were told would be 20 minutes, another family came up to us and commented on how unsafe they were feeling with this driver. The 20 minute break turned into a 45 minute break while the driver chatted at a table with a woman he obviously knew. Maybe he felt he could take a longer break having made the trip in what must have been record time. We actually wondered why we were taking a break at all, as we were so ahead of schedule due to constantly remaining well over the speed limit. We would have preferred to have just kept driving and arrive in Hanoi an hour earlier, having survived the careening bus ride anyway, and had more time for a decent meal in town instead of at a highway truck stop. I complained in writing to our travel agent but have yet to receive a reply. Very unsafe driver."

            "review": "Better option that the train. After taking the overnight train from Hanoi to Sapa, my wife and I decided we would throw away our return ticket and take the bus instead. it turned out to be a good choice - quicker and half the price. The bus left Sapa pretty much on time at 4 p.m, and we had seats 1 and 2 right behind the driver for a good view of proceedings. The seats were large, very comfortable and reclined far back enough to have a reasonable nap (somewhat like a premium economy seat on an airliner). Water was distributed as was a \"light snack\" (coconut-coated peanuts anyone?) which was promptly discarded. The drive itself was very comfortable, with the obligatory Vietnam highway hair-rasising moments e.g. passing on blind corners and facing motorcyclists barrelling at us on the wrong side of the road. We arrived in Hanoi Old Town right on schedule at 10 p.m. and agreed it was a much nicer way to travel than the train. The only grip we have is that there are very limited food options at the two stops along the way. The first stop is no more than a huge, barn-like building with a basic store selling dodgy local goods but no fresh food. The second stop did have some fresh food offerings but the bakery/caf\u00e9 that looked most promising turned out to be a disappointment - I went to order two bahn mi off the menu and was met with a blank stare by the cashier who gestured at the menu while shaking her head and repeating \"Nothing, nothing...\". The only other option was a noodle shop selling such delicacies as \"steamed cow\" - we gave it a miss and went hungry. If you do take the bus, take your own packed meal! You'd think with the tour buses full of Westerners that go by every day, these rest stops would be a bit more entrepreneurial and open a food stall that actually caters to the passengers."

Mrs. Yank and I took this bus yesterday, and everything was excellent!We were picked up at our hotel about 645 am in a smaller bus and taken to the main pickup point. The seating 2-1 across and there's plenty of legroom. The seats recline of course, and there are leg rests that can be raised. The most important thing about the bus, the seat comfort, was superb.We stopped at 2 restaurants/rest areas on the way, so rest stops were more than adequate. The driver was calm and unhurried, and since there's not much traffic on this highway, it was a very relaxing experience (no horn-honking, a relief after Hanoi).Travel hint - at the first rest stop, go to the back of the grocery section and see the bottles of local spirits. There are 2 very interesting brands - one has geckos in it, and the other has cobras and black scorpions in it. Worth a photo!2 thumbs up!"

It was really comfy (and I can compere with the bus Hanoi-Halong Bay after which I couldnt feel my back though the trip was shorter than Sapa-Hanoi). And if you have some reading material the trip will end in a moment :) They had a wifi also, but it did not work properly so its kind of a minus but wifi in Vietnam is poor anyways. So express bus goes faster than train, is more comfy, therefore i'd recommend this kind of transport."

The stops have a small convenience store, a hot food store, and western toilets. The bus was clean and the reclining chairs were really comfortable. The driver drove at safe speeds and only overtook where safe. The other staff member on the journey spoke English and provided a small snack and water. It was both raining and very foggy during our trip (i.e. not ideal driving conditions), but we felt safe the whole time. Therefore, I am unsure why people would bother to ride the train because of safety concerns. The traffic on the freeway is sparse and although it is a windy road for the last 30km, you would still need to take a bus for this part of the journey even if you opt to take the train."

We stopped at a couple of places for food and bathroom breaks and the bus gives you a little snack and water on the trip. The only thing--if you're at all nervous about heights and winding, steep roads, you might want to rent a seat on a smaller bus or get a private car. The roads to Sapa are very steep and winding and this is a huge tour bus, so it's mildly unnerving."

Took about 6 hours all up to get to Sapa.I had read some reviews and forum posts about the drive vs train being a bit risky safety wise, but maybe this is referring to before the new highway was put in as the drive was great and we felt very safe the whole time. The driver we had on the trip back to Hanoi was a little less cautious and faster than the driver on the way into Sapa, but still was totally fine.One thing to be ready for on arrival at Sapa is the many Hmong women who approach you as soon as you step out of the bus (they hang around the bus stop so I think this will happen whoever you go with) and try and get you to come to their village or buy something. We found being polite and firmly saying no was the best way to handle this, unless of course you want these.The person running the bus came and asked us all where we were all staying to try and help us get to our accommodation when we arrived however with all the confusion on arrival we ended up just figuring it out ourselves. The trip home is pretty straight forward. No snacks but did get given a water and we stopped once in Lao Cai to pick up some passengers that had booked from there and another time for a toilet stop/food. Bit more basic facilities here but enough and the one stop made the trip back a little quicker (closer to 5 and a half hours). The drop of point in Hanoi is in the old town, no hotel drop offs, but wasn't that hard to find a taxi, or we could have walked if we hadn't brought all our luggage with us. Overall I think this is a very easy and safe way to get to Sapa and if we were to return, would definitely go for this option again."

Just like get on and get off, drop off at the midway, therefore no need to have a Guide like this, by this way we lose our money extra for snap service. Nothing special for bus, like every tourist bus we've been through the south to the north of Vietnam. A little both water was set on bus. The fact is, all the bus stop in sapa town and very easy to findout the same like this, but only 15usd no more while we paid 22usd for the Express and high quality."

The bus was:- on time - with pick up option from Hanoi Old Quarter hotel and no unscheduled stops (note, there is a Lao Cai stop on the way back to Hanoi if there are passengers booked from there)- safe-feeling - seat belts, careful driver (especially by Vietnamese standards), new road means it is Express Way all the way to Lao Cai where train passengers have to get off and transfer to a bus to Sapa anyway- fast - got there in 5 1/2 hours including two toilet and food/drink stops- extremely comfortable - wide, reclining seats, footrests, pillows, blankets, bottled water & snacks provided, individual air-conditioning and lighting control- decorated beautifully (think magic carpet ride with coloured lights!)- staffed by a funny, English speaking guide who individually checked with all passengers to ensure they knew their way to their accommodation or otherwise arranged taxis, maps and whatever was needed for them (he also did some singing, whistling and general laughter and chatting with the driver...)- used by locals/expats from Sapa who also assisted people also with transport options and other local knowledge.All in all, we were very happy with this transport - thank you."

They were quick to respond and the charge was payable online via world pay. It's only $17 per person each way. This is much cheaper than a decent train carriage and it takes less time. If you take the train it is overnight (8 hours or so) plus another 2.5 to 3.5 hour drive to Sapa. The coach now takes 5.5 to 6 hours including 2 stops enroute (toilet and snack breaks) which total 30 minutes between them. The coach has large reclining seats and wifi (slow but enough to check email etc) the crew speak good English and we're helpful."

After a little research it was a no brainier- 5 hours on a bus and sleeping in a comfortable bed once we got to Hanoi rather than another uncomfortable 8 hour journey on the train. It was a great decision! The bus left Sapa around 4-4:30pm and we were in Hanoi by 10pm. There were two well spaced stops, the first being a 10 minute toilet break (brand new gas station, super clean with Western toilets) and the second a 30 minute dinner break (kind of a weird truck stop, but had vendor food, pho, snacks, etc. **If you go all the way to the left, there is an area with Western toilets, cost is $2000 dong, but way better than the alternative squat toilets with no stall doors on the other end of the place**). The bus itself was really comfortable with reclining seats and leg support. We were offered water, candy, pillows and blankets and the bus also had free wifi (super slow, but what do you expect on a bus in the middle of nowhere?!). The new highway from Lo Cai to Hanoi made the ride enjoyable, smooth, and fast. Would definitely do that again over the train!"

It leaves Sapa about 4pm and arrives Hanoi about 10pm. Aircon was great, not too hot nor too cold. I wasn't very well during this trip and so having a comfortable bus was amazing, I managed to sleep well. There is also a bonus wifi on board.

On the return trip we left right on time at 4.00pm and arrived in Hanoi at 9.30pm. We have undertaken many road trips throughout Asia and some have been very hairy, but the driver of the Sapa Express on both trips drove very cautiously. At no time was I worried about our safety. We paid US$102.00 return for 3 adults on the Sapa Express, which I think is good value."

Luxury Travel picked hotels and boats for us, arranged all our air travel in Asia, supplied city guides, and provided buses for airport transfers and inter-city travel. The hotels were well located and very nice; most of the guides were extremely interesting and spoke good English.

The majority of time was spent in Vietnam and we decided to use Luxury Tours to organise our eight days while in the country.We chose this company due to the ratings on TripAdvisor and asked the company to organise a trip starting in Hanoi, working our way down to Ho Chi Minh City. The team put together 4 stops which included Hoi An and Ha Long Bay. At each city the actual tour guide would meet us at the airport and would ultimately help us check in for the next flight. Throughout the entire trip they were helpful, receptive to our concerns and took on the feedback we provided. For example, on our second last day we had a mediocre experience at a restaurant which was catering more for the unadventurous western tourist. The food was terrible and we provided the feedback to our tour guide. She made sure the next day our restaurants hit the mark; and they did!All in all a fantastic trip and we would highly recommend Luxury Tours when in Vietnam."

We have travelled throughout Asia over the last few years. We are happy we visited, but it wasn't the trip we expected.Pluses:1. Excellent and timely communication through Ms. Hien Pham in the Luxury Travel office. She was good to work with.2. We had a private tour. Each guide and driver were waiting for us at the airport as soon as we arrived at (at Hanoi, Hue and HCMC). No hassles and very convenient.3. Hotels were good to excellent. However, do your own research and guide Luxury Travel to the type of hotel you want to stay in.Minuses:1. For us, the success of the trip is based on the guides. We had a total of 3 tour guides...one in Hanoi....one in Hue/ Hoian...one in Ho Chi Minh City. The last guide (Tran) was excellent. Her English was excellent, she actively spoke to us, she knew history. However, the other 2 guides were not as good or forthcoming with history. Perhaps we were expecting something more (like the quality of a National Geographic or Smithsonian tour), and we were disappointed in the lack of depth. This was the biggest negative about the trip. 2. Many meals were included in the price. The lunches were at touristy restaurants and were not adventurous. We looked around and these restaurants all had Westerners (not locals) eating. We didn't get the food experience we read about. Again, this could be fine for many travelers, but it wasn't what we hoped for. 3. The government can randomly close buildings. That happened in Hanoi and we didn't walk around the Ho Chi Minh Complex. WIsh the guide could have worked around the problem and found out in advance when the Complex would have been open in our 2 days there. 4. We had a one night cruise on Halong Bay. The cruise lasted 20 hours and it was 4 hours each way to drive to and from the dock. In a 10 day trip we weren't convinced it was a good use of limited time. I'll take the blame on not being focused on the distance to Halong Bay from Hanoi.For most travelers, Luxury Travel would be a safe and good choice. If you are looking for an easy trip with everything arranged in advance, I highly recommend them. If you are a more adventurous traveler hoping for a more intense experience....don't know if they are the right group to use."

The entire team of Luxury Travel (05 Nguyen Truong To Street, Ba Dinh Dist, Hanoi, Vietnam) with Special mention for Mrs. Duong ensured that we had one of the most memorable trips. At every instance they were in touch with us checking and ensuring that all travel and hotel facilities as well as excursions are as per our requirements and of the top most quality. Even at a couple of places where there was a communication mismatch with the hotel they were instantly up to the task of setting things in order within minutes. We never expected our trip to be so good and so luxurious. I would say we had the best of everything - luxurious private car, superb guides, excellent itenary and probably a very good execution team to constantly ensure we had an enjoyable, fun loving and memorable time together.

This is the abridged letter of thanks i sent to Luxury travel after they organised a 10 day, 4 city tour from south HCMC to Dalat to Nha Trang to Hanoi with many excursions in between. I hope this speaks for itself.-------I wanted to say thank you for organising this tour package. Normally i do not do Tours and travel by myself to experience as much of the country i can, this package was much better than i expected. We managed to see so many things and it was easy with everything organised so clearly for us. With a local SIM we always felt that we had help if we needed. This was a great comfort.For the destinations, it was really great to visit all the cities from HCMC, Dalat, Nha Trang and Hanoi ( with excursion). I felt this was perfect way to do this tour, travelling up the country as it was really hot down south and got cooler as we went north. Also the highlights of the trip and seeing beautiful places like Nha Trang and Halong bay was always a nice surprise and one the best bits for me so i did not feel we are reaching the end of the trip and got the feeling that something better is coming and next excursion could be better. If i can recommend i would say do from South to north for the tour recommended over north to south.Dalat was beautiful, We loved the greenery and coolness after HCMC, we went to the Pagoda tours, we visiting the Crazy house. Talking with the driver from the airport was really informative as he was very educated and informative. So we got a some history in the background for the Crazy House. A really great point of Dalat was the food, we found a great local place and we went there 2 times we liked the food so much. The drive from Dalat to Nha Trang was amazing, we really got to see central Vietnam as a country, the mountains the valleys, the greenery. Even some amazing waterfalls, I loved this way of travelling between Dalat and Nha trang. A big highlight.Nha Trang, was equally beautiful, in a different way. The longer stay in Nha Trang gave good resting time and the Sunrise Hotel was really really beautiful with view onto the beach and sea. Really magical.Halong bay was perfect, such a beautiful place. a unique place in the world. Again, thank you for organising this and the private taxi and overnight stay. We had a really nice room on the boat also with a balcony so we could enjoy the stars at night, it was amazing. I recommend Aphrodite as the staff and the attention and food was very good.I loved this trip and am now missing Vietnam. We really did a lot and felt that i got to see bit of the south, central and northern Vietnam. Just a little to get a taste. Part of me is in love with Vietnam now because you made the trip so amazing and easy.I want to say a big thank you for organising this, It has been one of my most memorable trips and i look forward to coming back to Vietnam.----------"

In planning our trip, I found the Trip Advisor reviews extremely useful, especially in selecting a travel company. So here is my contribution to other travellers.We organised our 15 day private family tour through Luxury Travel Vietnam and they were outstanding in every way. Ms Hien Pham from the Hanoi office was our coordinator and she really went out of her way to ensure a fantastic holiday. Over several weeks of planning, we added and subtracted visits, and shifted dates until we eventually settled on an ideal travel package. None of this was a problem for Hien Pham. She usually turned around an itinerary change overnight and was always friendly to deal with.As a company, Luxury Travel was friendly, efficient and totally reliable. They organised all of our internal flights, transport, accommodation, tours, and most meals. Every time we arrived at an airport, the Luxury Travel guide was there to meet us. And the helped us through check-in for onwards flights. The vehicles were always big, comfortable Ford Transit vans and there was always cold water and cold wipes available. We had several guides during our travels. Mr Trang in HCMC was very knowledgable on the history of te area as he had grown up through the war period, so was absolutely fascinating and engaging.Mr Thuy in Hanoi was almost more like a friend than a guide. He took us through Hanoi and flew with us to Dien Bien Phu, sharing his knowledge throughout. He also walked the ground with me as we explored the French strongpoints in Dien Bien PhuWe had Mr Phuong in Hue and Hoi An and he showed us all over the areas where he had grown up, including many 'off the beaten track' highlights.For our last few days in HCMC we had Mr Minh who was able to give a new understanding of the importance of the Mekong Delta area to Vietnam's economy nd to their culture.All of the guides and all of the drivers were outstanding.Accommodation was always located near to the local attractions and I have done separate reviews of each hotel, so just a summary here. Liberty Central in HCMC is right in the heart of the historical and market area, so planty to see. They also have best fitness centre out of all the hotels we stayed at. Four stars.Chalcedony in Hanoi is right opposite the Luxury Travel office, and again is right in the heart of Hanoi's attractions. 4 stars.Him Lam Resort in Dien Bien Phu is a huge accommodation/conference centre with cabin style accommodation. Needs some maintenance work but is in a good location for exploring the area. 3 stars.Imperial Hotel in Hue is outstanding. Rooms are fantastic, restaurant is top notch, and make sure you have a cocktail on the top deck- fantastic views. 5 stars.Likewise the Hoi An Beach Resort - fantastic rooms, great service, 50 metres to the beach.Also, we found Vietnam Airlines to be very efficient with a very modern fleet of Aibus and Boeing aircraft, including the latest 787 and 777 models, and great airport facilities. We had factored in some fat into the itinerary just in case flights were unreliable, delayed etc, but this was never the case. I am very impressed with Vietnam Airlines.Overall, I highly recommend Luxury Travel Vietnam to anyone who wants to organise their own itinerary rather than follow a standard group tour."

I must admit that we were quite worried as we had several flights, transfers and pick ups in our itinerary, but everything went like clockwork and all drivers were always on time. We decided to change our Halong Bay day trip to an overnight stay last minute and contacted Mrs Thu Huong (24 hour service) by email. We got a reply almost instantly from her and the trip was changed and the booking confirmed by return. Fantastic Service, great company, would definitely use them again when traveling around Vietnam."

This was the question a friend asked me before we left on our holiday in Vietnam arranged by Luxury Travel Co. Well there is not much difference between the price we paid and the group tours offered by so many touring companies.Also you know that you will be met at the airport even if Air Vietnam arrives almost 5 hours late as it was with our flight from Hanoi to Hue. Also, you are transported by air conditioned cars that take you as close to the destination as possible \u2013 a terrific advantage when it is hot, hot, hot and humidity is in the 90% range. And most importantly, your tour can be modified, in real time, to suit you, the traveller. An example of this was at the Angkor Watt temple. My wife who is quite agile but sports two new knees, is naturally cautious when accessing uneven surfaces. It was not uncommon for us to enter through doors marked exit because our tour guide thought that it was a flatter, more even surface.In another instance we were told that a visit to a sight, although on the itinerary, would be visited the following morning. We would leave a half hour earlier. We were ready to go at the appointed time and did not have to wait for the stragglers as so often happens with big groups.How can you get \u2018up close and personal\u2019 with a tour guide when there are twenty or more of you? How can you talk about their experience and their thoughts and aspirations rather than the formal veneer. And when I travel, I like to meet \u2018the people\u2019 and not only look at the sights \u2013 that you can do with videos.Our tour with Luxury travel had all of this and much, much more. Our tour guides all spoke with a reasonable level of English. Yes, one did have to concentrate because some of the pronunciation was sometimes tinged with French or Vietnamese, as would be expected. Only our guide in Phnom Penh had English to a conversational level but then she was a university literature graduate. A fabulous young lady. I hope that the guides were as happy with their clients as we were with them.All of our hotels were luxury. The itinerary was well chosen, although we did opt to have a few days at leisure \u2013 one each in Hanoi and HCMC.Food \u2013 generally good throughout, however when meals were provided they were usually a set menu. I personally would have preferred to be able to have an a-la-carte option and would have been willing to pay the difference. We did have to pay for drinks.Arranging the tour was simple. Every question was promptly handled by return email. Easier that if they were in the shopping centre just up the road. A big Thank you to Ms Hien Pham.Would I use Luxury Travel again? Well, regrettably, I don\u2019t think that I will be going back there in the near future, but I have already recommended them to a few friends so that means \u201cYes.\u201d Yes I would use them again and yes, I would like to go back."

We were met at the airport and taken to a fabulous hotel, the Kandawgyi Palace Hotel which is in the center of Yangon on a lake and very close to Shwegadon Pagoda. Our guides in Yangon, Mandalay, Bagan and Inle Lake all had excellent knowledge of history and english. Our car always had bottled water stocked every day. We flew from location to location on Air KBZ and the flights were on time and professional. All the hotels selected were first class. We especially loved the Myanmar Treasure Inle Lake staying in a cottage right on the lake and having my coffee on the deck watching the early morning fishermen.I would highly recommend the professionalism of Pham, our contact with Luxury Travel.

We decided to use the services of Luxury Travel Company based on the review on internet and also some background investigation. Having in mind that we landed in Hanoi( with various city tours) travelled by train to Sapa and back, thereafter to Ha Long Bay and back to Hanoi, thereafter to Nha Trang and An Lam Ninh Van Bay Villas and finally to Saigon and the Mekong delta (with various tours and river dinner), a lot of thing could go wrong , even highly likely it would, but every detail was professionally arranged by Miss Hien. High quality from the beginning to the end, with guides and drivers aiming at serving the guests to the extent possible. Quality has its price, also in Vietnam, but the trip arranged by Miss Hien was worth every dollar (Dong) spent, having in mind that two weeks is not a long time in such a beautiful and interesting country.Luxury Travel is highly recommended, Miss Hien did a fantastic job for us and Vietnam is a must for experienced travellers.The Norwegians"

I was at this stage a single traveller which made it much harder to book a cycle trip to Mai Chau especially as I had no flexibility with the dates. I approached various companies and was told that the minimum booking is for 2 people or alternatively I had to pay for two. Luxury Travel had no problems to accommodate me as a single traveller. Ms Hien offered me a very attractive itinerary for a good price. The planning and communication were very professional. I had my own very pleasant and knowledgeable guide (who was also my cycle companion), an experienced driver and our own minibus with the bikes in the back. I decided for a homestay with the local hill tribe people (I encourage you to do it as long as you don't mind to sleep on a thin mattress on the floor) and got rewarded with one of the best two meals during my three weeks in Vietnam. You obviously also have the opportunity to stay in a luxury accommodation in a beautiful setting if desired.I had two lovely half days of cycling around the scenic country side of Mai Chau. We stopped at several farms and I also had lots of photo opportunities. My guide also offered me some flexibility to do more or less cycling depending on ability and desire.

Our English speaking guide Mr Nang was able to modify our itinerary to meet unforseen situations such as major road construction. My group had full confidence in our driver Mr Wei.He had some challenging roads to contend with but at all times he drove safely. For such a long tour and with up to 10 hours in the minivan comfort becomes an important issue. I expected a better quality minivan with sufficient legroom to make transportation an enjoyable experience. I am sure Luxury Travel can make improvements in this area. Overall I would recommend LuxuryTrtavel as a reliable and caring company."

My experiences traveling with Luxury Travel were OUTSTANDING!After working in Vietnam for seven months as volunteer teachers in HCMC and making short trips to DatLat, CuChi, Tay Ninh and My Tho with Vietnamese friends from Ton Duc Thang University, we were eager to explore more of Vietnam before returning to USA. As retired Americans with a limited budget as well as the need to pace ourselves physically, we were impressed with Luxury Travel's planning skills and each individual tour guide's and driver's abilities to offer us daily alternatives during each itinerary. We planned three different tours with the assistance of Luxury Travel with a total of approximately 20 \"days-on-the-road\" tailored to our budget, time and interests. Luxury Travel enthusiastically responded to ALL of our requests, revisions and concerns during tours planning and then on a daily basis. We wanted to see typical tourist sites such as Hue, HaLong Bay, Hanoi and Sapa. Each guide and driver was exceptional in knowledge about history, culture, geography while also sharing personal stories and insights. Our \"off-the-wall\" questions were always answered -- even if a little \"overnight\" research was needed. Each guide's personality and sense of humor were a real addition to the fun of the tours. We also wanted to visit and learn more about the American War, Ho Chi Minh, General Giap and other political topics. We were interested in the economy, government and people's organizations of Vietnam. Luxury Tours worked with us to develop tours to Con Dao, Tuyen Quang Province, Nghe An Province and Hanoi which more than encompassed our interests. Again, each guide and driver was very attentive to our interests, questions and traveling goals. We often requested daily changes -- and were always gladly supported by the guides and drivers -- whether the change was an unplanned stop, trying new foods, taking specific photos, questions about local history or economy, discussing politics, sharing family stories, finding special types of souvenirs or taking time for rest and naps. The LONG hikes to ethnic group villages near Sapa were balanced with the relaxation of cruising HaLong Bay. All accommodations (hotels, restaurants, cars, HaLong boat) were comfortable -- often beautiful -- and perfect fits for our budget. We were VERY happy travelers!The knowledge, range of contacts, skills, talents and personalities of the Luxury Travel staff (Ms. Thao was the \"executive\" contact for us) make them the perfect partners for traveling in Vietnam. We hope to get to better know the incredibly friendly, warm, inspiring and interesting people of Vietnam with future visits. Meantime we greatly appreciate the Vietnam adventures we experienced with the help of Luxury Travel.I encourage any and all travelers to utilize the talents, skills and experience of Luxury Travel!Leanna Noble"

After 5 years of procrastination we finally decided to take a vacation trip to Vietnam, and on the advice of a friend we contacted Luxury Travel directly to organise a programme for us.From the initial email to the final departure from HCMC airport the trip went like a dream. We agreed with Mrs Quynh the outline of the 16 days, a trip which involved 5 star hotels individual travel arrangements and business class flights internally, and she then kept us up to date with the suggestions for accommodation, travel and the various excursions as she was booking them.We were met by their representative at the airport on arrival, and the trip went without a hitch, from Ho Chi Minh City, to Hanoi, Halong Bay, Hue, Hoi An, Danang, Dalat and back to Saigon, including three internal flights, several long car rides, and 6 different hotels. All the guides and reps were highly competent, transport worked perfectly and the hotels excellent. All this and having to cope with the Tet (Vietnamese New Year) preparations and celebrations which was going on all around us.In summary, we can completely endorse Luxury Travel, and would trust them to organise any Vietnamese Programme in the future."

The private, tailored service that was provided meant that we felt privileged and secure. Our company contact Ms Duong went out of her way to ensure that our travel arrangements were everything that we could have wished for. She was very effective and efficient.Our tour in Saigon, which was very well organised, included the main sights of the city and the main market (which we appreciated less) and an extraordinary trip to the Mekong delta which included a private sail on the Princess boat. Our stay at the An Lam resort was so enjoyable that we are going back this year, again organised with the help of Ms. Duong."

I am traveling with my husband on a 3 month trip and we'd been doing mostly budget things but decided to spend a little more to do 2 nights on Halong Bay with Paloma. It was such a wonderful experience and well worth the money! At first I was worried we'd be kind of over planned with group activities but that didn't end up being the case at all. The views are beautiful and just being on the boat you are immediately relaxed. Every single staff member was kind and eager to help and we enjoyed learning some stories from each of them. You can tell they take a lot of pride in their work and truly enjoy what they do! We were really happy to have chosen the 2 night option as the 1 night guests didn't get as much time to just relax and enjoy. The food on the boat was fantastic. I am a picky eater and don't like seafood which I was worried about, but I just let them know and they fixed delicious non-seafood alternatives for every single course of every single meal. I was so impressed! My husband did say however that it was some of the best seafood he had in Vietnam so I was probably missing out! Sleeping on the boat was great...two of the best nights sleep we've had on this whole trip. If I go back to Halong Bay I would happily do this cruise again and again!"

When I sent off the deposit online I got an email back saying if I send another 30% deposit they would drop the price another $60US so no problems there. We also go a free upgrade as well. Maybe because we walked to their office instead of hanging around for staff to come to us to pay. Not sure. This is a professional company from start to finish. Staff were friendly, all did their jobs well. Started with lunch, wow so much food. After lunch taken to a cave, then back to the boat for kayaking. That was so much fun particularly because my friend and I weren't very good at it particularly me as I have never done it. Here were we kayaking about 3kms into a cave. It is a must do. So many laughs. After this was swimming and relaxing. Dinner was even more impressive than lunch. Again heaps of food. Drinks were a bit expensive but compared to home still cheaper. I am so glad we chose this cruise after the hotel tried to sell us a different one at over $100 US each more expensive. That is a lot of beer and drinks money. This cruise I highly recommend."

He even gave us our own demonstration at the pearl farm as it was too busy for the four of us to join in with the rest of the group. The food was also brilliant, very varied and plenty of it, sometimes it was difficult to finish. In addition, the activities were perfect. Kayaking around the mountains was one of my highlights along with Thai chi on the boat deck in the morning whilst sailing through the bay. The cabins were clean and had everything you could possibly need for a place to rest your head. They were small, but I don't know what you would expect for a cabin on a boat. Paloma only has 22 cabins on board meaning that the staff take their time to get to know you and can really focus on making your trip with them special. I would certainly recommend Paloma if you're considering taking a trip to Ha Long bay. Thank you Harry and your team for making it so perfect."

Ha Long Bay is incredibly beautiful and peaceful - you feel like you're on the edge of the world once you're out in the bay.With Paloma Cruises we could fully enjoy the beauty and serenity of the bay thanks to their five star service, comfortable cabins, and smooth itinerary.I loved how you could do however much or little you felt like when it came to activities. For example we didn't feel like kayaking and therefore opted for cocktails on the deck and a quick dip later on. The staff also made a good effort to get people to mingle by putting on a \"Sunset Party\" with happy hour and complimentary snacks up on the top deck. Not only was the sunset phenomenal, but the drinks we strong and the music was on point for getting people socializing. I would highly recommend paying more for a seamless experience like this. The people on our boat definitely seemed happier than a lot of other groups we saw coming and going between their boats and the sites we saw!Oh and also a shout-out to our cruise manager/guide Hoang - or Harry in English - who kept the atmosphere light and full of laughs with his own special brand of humor.

This was a magical experience, and I would recommend Paloma to anyone looking for a fantastic cruise option in Halong Bay.My mother and I selected a mid-range cruise and went on a 2 day/1 night cruise, which included visiting some less touristy parts of Halong Bay, visiting a cave, a pearl village and some swimming or kayaking for those who were interested.Right from the start, we could see this was a really well organised company. The transfers from Hanoi worked brilliantly. On arrival in Halong City, we were taken to an office to wait (free drinks and WIFI). Then organised efficiently onto a tender to travel out to the boat. We were impressed by the high safety standards and that we were all told to wear life jackets at all times on the tender.The boat was lovely: very clean and all the food we were served was delicious. Our cabin was also spotless.We very much enjoyed the excursions to the cave and the village. I went swimming in the bay, which was a great experience.What really made this special though were the staff. Mr Bean is an excellent guide with brilliant English. Justin was an excellent instructor at squid fishing. What I want to say here though is that without exception, all the staff were fantastic. They were professional at all times and very polite and helpful. I am sorry I do not have all their names, and I also know that there are many staff members working hard who the passengers do not see. But if anyone from Paloma management reads this, I would like to say that I hope they value the staff, because they were fantastic.For us, Paloma was definitely the right choice."

We went on the two night/3 day cruise and everything was very well organised. The bedrooms were small but comfortable with ensuite shower and good views over the water. All meal is were included and of good quality. We visited a cave on the first afternoon and loved being on the Sun deck before dinner. The views of Halong Bay are truly memorable. Mr Bean was a fantastic entertaining host. On the second day we were transferred to a smaller boat and went kayaking - the highlight going through a cave into a 'lost world'. Boys enjoyed jumping and swimming off the boat. Thanks to Mr Justin who was also a fabulous host. On the last day we got up early to visit a fishing village, and taken on an hour bamboo boat ride around it. All good fun. On returning to the main boat we checked out and had a fun cookery lesson on spring rolls before going back to port. The return mini bus journey to Hanoi was included as part of the price.One disconcerting episode on the boat was on the first night at about 3am when I happened to look out the window and saw another boat drifting towards us. I called the manager who called the captain and they were able to wake the other crew to move their boat. Apparently we were not in danger but it was scary to see a boat so close ( it even bumped us twice), particularly at that time in the morning! It was dealt with quickly and efficiently though and hasn't put me off. I would go again tomorrow if I could!"

On board Mr. Bean and Harry were the most professional and helpful staff we've met.This was our second time on Paloma, therefore: Highly recommended! Thank you for making our lifelong dream come true!"

            "review": "Good experience but could have some improvements. Overall we really enjoyed the cruise, the landscape was stunning and the boat and people on board including the staff were lovely. A few things to note, the 2 days and 1 night is actually about: 24 hours in total. The kayaking lasted about 10 minutes. The fishing from the back of the boat was funny because after 10 minutes we were told it isn't actually squid season! The staff on board are lovely but I get the impression that a lot of it is centred around getting a good review on trip advisor rather than actually providing a top class service. Expense wise, be careful not to rack up a 1.5 million bar tab like we did, one annoyance here is that we were offered coffee after lunch and were charged for it, really should have been free!Having said that, the rooms were great, the food was amazing and the way the trip runs is pretty smooth.Anyway to summarise, I would highly recommend Paloma cruise to everyone and thank them for a good 24 hours!"

The cruise captain, Harry, was a great host, and unleashed several good jokes. The rest of the crew were approachable and provided impeccable service during our stay. They even woke up at 2am to try and help us tune into the Euro 2016 game even though we were out at sea. A very dedicated team! The tour itinerary was relaxed and enjoyable."

We were nervous about doing the cruise, especially as we were taking our daughter and we had read many bad reviews about different cruises through Halong Bay. But this cruise was absolutely fantastic. The food was excellent, they serve many different varieties of dishes. We had the family room which is up the front of the boat and we had our own balcony. The service was 5 star, the English was very good! We enjoyed the whole atmosphere and the activities we did! Would recommend this cruise for families!"

My hotel offered this cruise at a very high price plus a single supplement making it incredibly expensive. I contacted the company directly by whatsapp and they were much more accommodating.The cruise was run professionally and I enjoyed it but there are a few things you need to beat in mind and I suspect this is applicable to all 2 day 1 night cruises.....When you take in travelling time two and from Halong Bay you are really just spending 24 hours on the boat. I suspect a 3 day cruise is more value for money.Due to the tight timings you are on a tight timetable so kayaking takes place at a specific time, swimming takes place at a specific time etc.The level of English spoken by the crew was good and Harry and Bing were great!The food is great but in your last day you have breakfast at 7.45 and lunch (brunch) at 11. I didn't love the way the meals were crammed in.You visit a pearl farm and fishing village which you sail to on sampans but because our Sampan was the last to leave we missed most of he explanation of how cultured pearls are produced. They should really wait for the whole group to be together.I had a slight issue in that I was undercharged for the cruise so had to go to the office to pay the correct amount. I had no issue with this but I therefore incurred 3 sets if bank charges with no apology which was a little frustrating but not a total disaster.This cruise was good and I would recommend it but with a caveat that a 3 day trip might be better."

I recommend the 2 night cruise because of all the activities you miss otherwise. There is plenty of time for leisure and fun activity (kayaking, swimming, exploring caves, fishing, etc.).The van ride from Hanoi to the port is about 4 hrs. Long trip but the van has good Wi-Fi which helps to make the time go by quickly. Acceptable room accommodations on board, GREAT food, organized activities, great sightseeing and plenty of humidity in June. Rooms are air conditioned which makes sleeping comfortable.

He was genuine and very friendly, making us feel very welcomed like friends with the many stories he shared. There was a little boy in our cruise who was crying in pain from a jellyfish sting during the swim, and Mr Bean went out of his way to do magic tricks for him just to cheer him up. It was a very kind thing for him to do and we are truly moved by such a caring nice crew :) Everyone was so friendly and accommodating and it was a very comfortable stay for us with good food and fun time!

Whether he is guiding you by kayak through caves, jumping off the roof with you into the water, or showing you his amazing card magic abilities, Mr. Bean does everything with an uplifting smile on his face.

But that said, the rooms are comfortable and clean, though my shower door dislodged from the hinge. There were sufficient activities to keep everyone entertained with some downtime. My kids loved the sea kayaking and cave visit. We were on the 1N/2D which we felt was plenty. The bay was beautiful and quiet. We were fortunate that our cruise was assigned a quieter route to Bai Tu Long bay. Once we left the port of embarkment, it got quiet and less boats were around us.

Ha Long and Bai Tu Long bays are beyond beautiful, and this cruise did the UNESCO World Heritage Site justice, taking us to sites that, while firmly on the tourist trail, were far from crowded. It helped that the ship was only a quarter full, but life on board was really pleasant. The food was great, the cabins clean and comfortable, the view of the limestone islands constantly surprising. The service is good, though the attentiveness of the guides and crew can get repetitive (the need to constantly entertain wore thin, and I would happily have been left alone). The opportunity to kayak to a cove hidden within one of the islands, straight out of The Land That Time Forgot, was worth the price alone."

We booked the family suite which had a beautiful private balcony with three sunbeds. The spacious balcony faced the very front of the boat and gave us an excellent view. We had a lot of fun on our own private deck. The boat is in fairly good condition for a 10 year old boat though we did see some signs of aging in the woodwork in the bathroom. The food was excellent and plentiful. The crew are very friendly and accommodating, especially Mr. Bean who took good care of us. Activities were well planned, though a little rushed. The boat docked at a very scenic area in Bai Tu Long Bay and we kayaked from the boat. Swimming was also done off the boat. My young daughter really enjoyed both these activities. The cave visit was very average. However, the visit to the floating fishing village was a highlight. We got into little boats rowed by locals who also kindly lent us some conical Vietnamese hats which gave good protection from the fierce sunlight and made for great photo shoots. The scenery around this floating village was absolutely stunning. I believe the sunlight brings out the beauty of the bay and summer is a good time to visit. The route that Paloma took was not crowded, in fact we only came across an occasional boat or two and we did not see unsightly rubbishy in the sea. Choose Paloma for a special and memorable experience."

            "review": "Highly recommended cruise to see Ha Long Bay/ Bai Tu Long Bay!!. My gf and I took an amazing 2 night cruise with Paloma and it was easily one of the highlights of our Vietnam trip! I will preface the rest of this review by saying that you cannot compare this cruise to American or European cruises. This is a different experience. Keep an open mind and you will have a great experience. If you have the time and money do the 2 night tour. Our friends did the 1 night tour and it was very short. You really need that extra day to relax and enjoy the bay. Also definitely go swimming on that first day! That was probably the better of the two beaches if you do the 2 night cruise. One last thing, for the love of god bring sunblock!!! The sun is brutal and it is very hard to find anywhere in Vietnam let alone on a boat!! SERVICE: Hotel pickup and dropoff from Hanoi was excellent. We shuttled in an uncrowded minibus with good working AC. There is one rest stop on the way but its a total tourist trap. Use the restrooms, by a drink and be on your way. The service on this boat was very good. The crew was very helpful and met all our needs. Mr. Bean even let us borrow some sunblock when we couldn't find any of our own. Its easy to see the crew works very hard to accommodate all passengers, especially Mr. Bean and Justin. The crew only get 4 days off a month. The rest of the time they are working on the cruise to make sure you are enjoying yourself. ACCOMMODATIONS: Our room as well as our friends room was clean, with fresh linens, and ice cold AC. Bathrooms had all the basic amenities and all plumbing worked as it should. The dining area is enclosed and has AC as well as fans which you don't really appreciate this until you see some of the other boats in the area. There is also a bar and a number of 4 seater tables. You are encouraged to talk with and engage the other passengers. We met some very fun and interesting people on this trip! The upper deck lounge was beautiful to watch the sun set in the evenings. Plenty of seating and a bar with decent selection to order drinks from.FOOD: The food overall was good. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a combination of western and Vietnamese cuisine. All other meals were Vietnamese with plenty of portions! Nothing particularly stood out, but the steaming prawn dish was kinda cool to see.ITINERARY: On the 1st day activities were somewhat enjoyable. The cave was a bit mediocre, but the beach was really nice to get away from the heat and humidity. I kind of wish we had more time there though. Dinner and relaxing in the evening was probably the highlight that day. On the 2nd day we were transferred to a smaller boat to take a day trip to another part of the bay. This day consisted of kayaking, swimming, exploring a cave, and relaxing on the boat with beer and cocktails. Once the boat anchored, we jumped in some kayaks to an isolated beach for swimming and lunch. Unfortunately there was quite a bit of trash in the water near the beach and the sun was pretty oppressive so once coming ashore everyone just hung out under whatever minimal shade there was. This was the low point of the trip since we were expecting a clean white sandy beach with clear water. We ended up kayaking back to the boat for lunch fortunately as it would have been too hot on the beach. After moving to another location, we took the kayaks out again and docked at a fairly impressive cave. We explored the cave while Justin acted as our tour guide. Upon returning to the boat, we were allowed to jump in to the water for a swim. This was both enjoyable and nerve-racking as we had noticed jelly fish throughout the day around our kayaks. But I didn't fly halfway across the world to just sit on a boat. We scanned the waters and determined there were no jelly fish around the boat so we jumped in. After cooling off with a swim in the bay and a few more beers we headed back to the main boat for our last dinner and some more relaxation. On the 3rd day, we visited the floating fishing village and pearl farm. It was pretty cool to see that people actually lived in these little floating huts. The pearl farm was somewhat interesting as well. VALUE: This cruise was by far our biggest expense for our 2 week Vietnam trip. However I think this is the only way to really appreciate and take in Ha Long Bay's beauty. Well worth the money in my opinion!"

We enjoyed many aspects of the Paloma cruise--very good food that was extremely plentiful, charming wooden boat and cozy cabin, and wonderfully friendly crew. However, we ended up being rather unhappy with the 2n/3D cruise. For the second day we were transferred to a small boat for the day while the large boat returned to port to pick up more people. On the small boat we were urged to stay on the top deck where there was not enough shade and it was sweltering hot--close to 37 degrees. The staff stayed on the lower deck and had fans blowing, but there was no air conditioning (or at least it was not turned on). We came back from the long day exhausted and dehydrated. Then on the final day we were asked to clear out of our cabins by 9:30AM, but ended up sitting in the dining room until the boat docked at 12:30 so that the crew could clean the cabins for the next group of customers. Paloma cruise company seems to be trying to squeeze in as many customers as possible, but they do so at the expense of their current customers. Why not have separate 2 day vs 3 day tours, and allow everyone to stay comfortably on the big boat?Also be aware that drinks are not included in the cost of the tour, and there is no water available to drink except for bottled water that you purchase. I do want to say that we truly appreciated the warmth and professionalism of Harry and Mr. Bean, who do a marvelous job and are clearly not responsible for the issues I raised above."

Lastly, every meal was delicious and filling. I would also like to make a special shout out to Mr. Bean, the assistant cruise manager, who is one of the most amazing people we have ever met. He went out of his way to make our trip as fun and worthwhile as possible, and I cannot begin to express how grateful we are for his help and friendship. Do not hesitate - choose Paloma Cruises! -Michael and Saskia"

One good thing however was that I am Coeliac and they took my Gluten free diet very seriously, I appreciated that!With regards to the activities, the cookery class cannot really be called this - we made Spring Rolls but they had already prepared all the filling so really we just rolled the Spring Rolls. Also the beach we visited was disappointing, it was very small and over crowded! Kayaking and squid fishing was fun though and the fishing village was a nice little trip (despite the rain which could not be helped!)Overall, a nice trip with beautiful scenery but don't expect too much from the food."

Wewere not on a high budget so we ruled out all of those $500 cruise options and opted for midrange. There were stilla lot to choose from.. after spending few dahs on reviews and costs from travel agents, we came across paloma. Impress travels gave us at a price of $135 which seemed good for the reviews of paloma. We booked it although we knew we were not into the big shor cruises. But to our surprise, our expirience in paloma was beyond expectations. The crew was very helpful and friendly, especially the manager. There was a lot of food that kept coming and every single dish was very good. We had a vegetarian request already made, and it was very warm when the crew took extra care to make sure the veg food was as good as their usual listed menu. They had substituted veg options for every dish in the list including the soup and always made sure we liked the food.Absolutely no complains abt the food. We took the 1 night 2 day package so we found the activities were a bit rushy but afterall we went for a vacation and wouldn wanna get bored there. So we were fine with it. The rooms are not so big but they are cozy and comfortable and all u need for a night. Overall, our expirience with paloma was beyond expectations, and I would choose paloma again for a 2 night stay since I have already seen their standard of customer satisfaction."

If anyone is thinking that this cruise is expensive, let me first tell you, it's not. You get five course meals of deliciously prepared food. You can get a chartered boat to a remote area to kayak and swim. We were lucky enough to have a nearly empty boat so we basically had a private boat take us to remote areas in Ha Long Bay with our own, amazing Chan. Words cannot describe how beautiful and amazing this Junk Boat is. And Chan was the icing on the cake."

Paloma is ranked a 4 star cruise and I found it to be very well worth the price compared to a 5 star. I'm not sure what could have been that different or that marginally better on a 5 star. We opted for the private transfer for $120 USD both ways. We didn't want to be crammed on a bus with 7 other people for a 4+ hour ride, despite the vans were pretty spacious. I thought the private transfer was a car, but it ended up to be our own private bus. Wifi on the bus - not strong but it's something. The food on Paloma was incredible. Truly authentic and everything plated - not a buffet like I expected (except at brekky). 2 lunches, 1 dinner and 1 breakfast - all delish! All drinks are extra $ except at breakfast. 2 complimentary water bottles in your room. The rooms are adequate as well. A little dark inside, but a working A/C, standing shower... the washroom is tiny but it is a cruise cabin. Queen bed was quite large actually. The activities that we chose to partcipate in were great. On the first day we visited the cave and did kayaking in the bay. It was an amazing realization that we were kayaking in Halong bay... the cave was a little busy as other boats were stopping off there as well. There was squid fishing at night and Tai Chi in the morning which we skipped to get some ZZs. The next day we went to a traditional fishing village which I thought was was really cool. It was so beautiful and serene, and we were being rowed in a wooden boat by 1 person. Amazing arm strength! Staff on the boat were really friendly. Mr.Bean, Harry, and the other server staff were really good. English was good and we could communicate well. The schedule is pretty packed. They announce where you have to be over the PA, and you pretty much have no time to dilly dally. The moment they announce, you need to show up. Overall - I would recommend Paloma. We had a good experience."

They are well trained in hospitality and really know how to make you feel comfortable amongst other guests.The cruise is great value and was everything I expected it to be. The Paloma cruise visits the quieter northern areas of the bay so we didn't feel overwhelmed by masses of other tour boats. I would really recommend doing the 3 day tour as the second day allows you time to relax with a spot of kayaking, swimming and generally relaxing enjoying the sights and a few cold drink."

Bathrooms were clean and equipped with the best shower head we've had since landing in this country.The food was absolutely unreal. The freshest fish, prawns and squid you'll ever have.Having never been on a cruise, I didn't quite know what to expect in terms of meals. Paloma Cruise would die before they let you go hungry. The quality of the meals is worth an entire essay on it's own, but I'll leave you with just one word: INCREDIBLE.I'd highly recommend doing two nights on this cruise, as one is simply not enough.Mr. Bean, the guide for our second day, was one of the most exceptionally positive and kind person I've ever had the privilege of meeting. We shared stories. He practiced his English by conversing with us for hours- teaching us about the Vietnamese culture.Without Mr. Bean (and Harry) the trip wouldn't have been the same.Harry, the cruise manager, was hilarious.

One of us was late for the pick up and they even managed to get a taxi meeting the pick up van on the way...If you go to Ha Long Bay this should be your first choice!!!"

Our cruise was quite delayed and the first day felt incredibly rushed. We were very much looking forward to the kayaking portion which was cut to about 15-20 minutes total. The food was good but the 5 course meals took up a lot of time that I would have liked to have spent elsewhere. I also with my significant other on a romantic trip but we were seated with other people during meals... we would have preferred our own table or to sit outside of the dining room on the deck and enjoy each other's company. The evening party was nice on the deck as the sun was setting and the cabins are comfortable. My final grievance was that everyone else on the boat seemed to have received a Paloma Cruise gift bag with a scarf except my boyfriend and I. I asked the cruise director about it and he didn't really seem to understand what I was saying and never got an answer.Overall, Halong Bay is quite the site to be seen, but I don't think the cruise was the best fit for our travel style."

            "review": "Private day cruise to Halong bay. I was very excited about this day and sadly was somewhat disappointed. We signed up for the day tour which was to include 6 hours at Halong bay. In actuality it was 4.5 hours at Halong bay as the driver/ guide stopped at a tourist / souvenir shop for 30 minutes on the way to and from Hanoi. We also stopped for an additional 30 minutes at a pearl factory. We were told we needed to stop \"for the driver to eat\". I find this very frustrating as he had all day to eat and certainly could have made the 3 hour trip without stopping for a meal as we did. It was clearly a stop built into the trip as all tour busses passing by stopped. I feel that this is a dishonest practice. Had I wanted to shop I would have signed up for a shopping tour and not any rather expensive 6 hour tour that was not fulfilled to my expectations. Also, although not at all the fault of this tour company, the bay was beautiful but had a large amount of trash floating around. On the positive side, our guide was wonderful. Quite fun and spoke great English. Would not recommend this tour."

We were met at the Bay by cheery staff and taken to the boat, given a quick briefing and shown our cabins. They were comfortable and clean.From there on it was very well organised, with hardly a dull moment, the bay is magnificent, the food onboard was excellent, the staff were always on hand and willing to please. We did a three day two night cruise, it was agreed that those who did only the 2 day one night cruise missed the best experience which comes on the second day of the three days. The 2 day 1 night people only did our first and last day. For the second day we cruised off and kayaked most of the day to places that only a kayak could reach. The scenery was a cross between Jurassic Park and King Kong. Fantastic. A special mention should go to Justin our guide. He was excellent, so polite and ready to assist at all times. It was truly a memorable experience."

My wife and I went on the 2d/1n cruise (24 hours really) and whilst the trip was fairly full itinerary-wise like others have mentioned this meant there was always something to do in our short time on the boat. Ha Long Bay is well and truly on the beaten track as the thousands of other tourists and dozens of boats will attest to, so really the difference in experience will likely come down to the boat, staff and food.The boat, while not as luxurious as the web site lets on, was very comfortable and the cabins were of a good standard. The staff did everything they could to make the trip enjoyable and memorable. Mr. Bean is an absolute character from the very first minute you arrive at the office to the moment you leave, cracking cheesy jokes and having fun. The food was of a high standard and you will not go hungry. Plenty of courses, and the drinks were of a reasonable price."

Justin is definitely my favourite staff member- he is down to earth and genuine, really friendly and a great entertaining guide. The tours are full of activities like cooking demonstration, tai chi and kayaking. We had a room on floor1 - they are quite small but you don't spend enough time there for it to be a problem."

We had limited time in Vietnam and really wanted to squeeze in a visit to Ha Long Bay. The Paloma Cruise 1 night, 2 day cruise was a really great way to experience this incredible place. Bear in mind, this is a cruise and they have activities, so if that's not your thing you can skip or you might want to consider another way to see the area, but I didn't mind. They also feed you. A LOT. Vegetarian meals are an option, you just need to let them know when booking (and they check several times to confirm). The veggie meals were very tasty, too. Drinks are extra, but they have a little happy hour special and, honestly, I come from a place where cocktails are at least $10 a piece. This was much less. When we went the weather was a little cooler and foggy, it was still so beautiful, but I would bet it's like paradise when you catch a sunset on the water. My only slight qualm is that I would've loved to have seen more wildlife, but it's cruise and we had one night, so I realize not everything is possible. One more thing, the staff were incredible. Our tour guide (Harry is his western name) was HILARIOUS and so attentive to everyone on the ship. Just the nicest guy ever and really professional and just super fun to be around. All in all a terrific experience. (Quick note: rooms are comfortable and stylish and the rainfall shower was great!)"

He showed us lots of hidden caves and much quieter and relaxing areas of the bay that we had all to ourselves (except for the sighting of rare monkeys jumping around in the trees right above us!). We weren't expecting the 2nd day kayaking to be as good (we thought it would just be a quick paddle around one Island, but was so much better than that).The food on board was amazing and plentiful, with drinks not being overpriced.We were there at the same time as a family who were returning for their 3rd trip and we can see why!Would definitely recommend Paloma cruises, Harry, Mr. Bean and Justin made it a very memorable trip."

Although Paloma are on the expensive side for Halong Bay you definitely get what you pay for and the food was incredible!Although the weather was slightly chilly during our stay we still enjoyed the activities like kayaking and hiking. We saw some amazing caves on the 2nd day so it is definitely worth doing the 2 night cruise as you would miss out on these breathtaking caves otherwise.The cabins are clean and tidy. They also have heating which was very welcome after being out in the cold all day!After spending hours reading reviews of cruises for Halong Bay I am certain that Paloma are definitely the cruise to choose!!"

Hiking through caves, going to the beach, kayaking, jumping off boats, cooking classes, squid fishing, sunset parties, visiting fishing villages, and eating eating eating. The first day was especially jam packed, we were given about 10 minutes to get ourselves sorted out between activities. I definitely recommend doing the three night, two day option if you can as the second day is a little more relaxing and gives you a real chance to see Ha Long Bay. It also means getting to spend more time with Mr Bean, an absolute star! Huang (or Harry) was also lovely, he was really good with kids on the boat. I enjoyed his jokes: especially the one about breakfast being served at 6:45am. Although that wasn't a joke. :( The highlight for us was seeing the 65kg fish on the second day: seriously the thing is bigger than my boyfriend's parents' pet labrador. The food on the cruise was all really good, I think there was only one thing I didn't like and that was on the very last day. My only disappointment was getting up at 6am for thai chi only to be stood up by my wee pal Mr Bean!"

I'm so glad I decided to take a chance and go forward with the booking. The shuttle ride there was uneventful, the return was a little more discerning but I had complete faith that our driver would get us there in one piece. Halong Bay is definitely a must see when visiting Vietnam. If you go, go with Paloma. Here's why: 1) THE FOOD2) the service 3) the itinerary4) did I mention the food?I was completely blown away by the food and I have been on various high end cruises. The chef here has them all beat hands down. If he opened a restaurant, I would eat there every night. WOW!! Every meal was incredible. The food alone is reason enough to go. Next, the service is amazing. You are picked up in the shuttle (with free wifi) on time. They pick up in the old quarter but they only pick up from a few different hotels per shuttle bus so it didn't take long at all. That was wonderful. Mr. Bean made the trip so fun and enjoyable. All the staff has such a wonderful and caring attitude, but Mr. Bean takes the extra step to make you feel like family. He even made us very special origami. The rooms were AWESOME! They deliver your luggage to your room just like a high end cruise. They made us feel like royalty. The rain shower was awesome and the bed was very comfortable. I did not find the bay overcrowded, I found it quite peaceful considering it is such a huge tourist destination. We booked on booking.com and got a great rate. They have a full itinerary but I never felt rushed or like it was too much. It was actually quite perfect. I read complaints about the cost of booze, the beer was double what you pay on shore. So instead of $1 a beer you're paying $2. Loosen the purse strings, it's $2 a beer! Where else can you find that on a cruise??The only complaint I have is the stop you make with the shuttle half way through the four hour trip to Halong Bay. The prices there are expensive. We grabbed chips, nuts and a couple of cans of beer. It was $20. Lesson here? Buy your snacks before you go. Overall an excellent experience that I highly recommend!"

The weather in Halong Bay wasn't great, it rained most of the time we were there but this didn't stop us. The crew made sure we had just as good a time as if it had been brilliant sunshine. All the activities were tailored for us and the weather with things such as a spring roll cooking class, and a 'rainset' party as there was no sun! Lucky for us the rain stopped just as we went out kayaking and this was one of the highlights. Seeing the more secluded parts of Halong Bay through amazing caves and we even saw a family of monkeys on the way back. We definitely didn't go hungry on the cruise either. Every meal was incredible and there was so much food! Our room was great, and even when we found a small leak because of all the rain we got moved to a different room, an upgrade in fact to a suite! A special shout out needs to go to Mr Bean as well. All the crew on Paloma cruises were amazing but without Mr Bean we wouldn't have had nearly such an incredible time! He was always laughing and joking with us and the other passengers, doing everything he could to make sure we had the best time possible on the cruise. He was the highlight of our trip!

We wanted a higher end experience so decided to try Paloma - and we were not disapointed! They picked us up from our Hanoi hotel to drive us out to Halong Bay to get on the boat. Our only complaint of the entire experience was the shuttle van - it is a small van and was very cramped and uncomfortable for the long ride. They said they had recently switched from using larger buses to make it easier for driving in Hanoi. You always take a tender out to the boat, which was quick and easy. Our luggage was transferred to our room as we enjoyed a welcome drink on board. The boat is very nice, clean, and comfortable. We booked one of the Paloma Suites which was well worth it. We had a large comfortable bed, wine/water/fruit platter, safe, clean bathroom, and separate sun room with comfortable couch and windows all around which was lovely to lounge in as we cruised. The first day we were served a delicious lunch (menu: Halong seafood soup, Kohlrabies salad with vermicelli noodles, steamed basa fish with fragrance leaf, sauteed pork rib, chicken skewer with peanut sauce, stirfried seasonal vegetables, steamed fragrant rice, caramel cream, and tea/coffee). Next we tendered to a floating village, where we got a paddle boat ride through the village and islands. The daytrip finished with a visit to a pearl store. We didn't purchase anything there, but it was interesting to see the pearl retrieval process. In the evening, we had cocktails on the top deck, followed by a spring roll making class (they turned out delicious!), then dinner (menu: beef and corn soup, banana blossom and chicken salad, king prawns on hot rock, wrapped Halong fish with spicy sauce, fried squid with garlic butter, sauteed mixed vegetables with chili bean, steamed fragrant rice, hot banana with vanilla ice cream, and tea/coffee) which was absolutely delicious! After dinner we tried out squid jigging which was really fun! You go out on the tender boat (attached to the Paloma ship) and jig for squid using lights and a fishing rod. The next morning we went to Hang Sung Sot (amazing cave) which was just that - amazing! It was a bit of a warm walk up into the entrance of the cave, but once you are in it is huge, cool temperature and just amazing to explore. Our trip finished off with lunch (I didn't get the menu, but part of it included stuffed pork, pudding, and coffee/tea). Finally, we were transferred from the boat back to the dock and shuttled back into Hanoi. We were leaving Hanoi right from our cruise, so rather than being brought into the city and having to take a taxi back to the airport, they stopped along the highway (literally) and hailed us a taxi to take us to the airport. This was a wonderful cruise on a well equipped boat, amazingly friendly and helpful staff who make the trip really enjoyable and they really tried to get to know us which was nice, and we got to see beautiful Halong Bay! We highly recommend Paloma Cruise!"

Meals were absolutely divine and we certainly thank everyone there for making us feel so welcome.I was also impressed with their safety regulations. They made sure we always had life jackets when necessary. I noticed some other groups on other cruises did not have life jackets when we crossed paths. So this is a credit to Paloma cruise for ensuring our safety. Furthermore our cabins also had life jackets and torches to access in case of an emergency as well.We came during the cold raining season and Halong Bay was still mystical and magnificent. Although it was too cold to go swimming or kayaking it was still lovely to just take in the atmosphere. We will certainly be back during the warmer season so that we can take full advantage of the bay and will probably indulge in a 2 night 3 day package.Highly recommended."

Loved whole thing ! One night was perfect length for us, food was good. The Paloma suite had incredible 180 degree view with like 8 windows wrapped around the corner off the boat. Many curtains in perfectly placed positions, I recommend the small upgrade.The ocean is not that cold even in January, I went swimming to peoples horror. Everybody thinks it freezing cold. Really it was refreshing and could swim around for 10 to 15 minutes. but I waited to long:)(Comfortable vehicle on drive, happy people, who love there work and are good at it:)We also did the motorbike tour and got another discount and that was a whole adventure of a lifetime on it's own. The drivers were very skilled and took care of us, even in the rain storm, hehe"

We have just returned from a three day two night Paloma Cruise thru the beautiful Halong bay and were simply blown away by the spectacular scenery and raw beauty of this region. Paloma cruises were recommended to us and we can not fault their authentic service and level of enthusiasm. Our tour guides and crew, particularly Bean, Justin and our cruise coordinator Harry truly made the cruise an experience we thoroughly enjoyed. Excellent value for money and a highly recommended experience onboard a traditional vessel viewing one of the truly beautiful natural wonders of the world."

When I was researching companies, they all seemed the same and I was quite confused. So I took the recommendation of Paloma from a friend and we're glad we did. I guess Paloma is considered a \"mid-range\" cruise - but it seemed quite nice to us. The staff was amazing - over-the-top accommodating, very entertaining and just tons of fun. We had some delicious meals, kayaked on the bay and met really great people. It felt easy to meet people - in fact, we had the benefit of meeting a geologist at lunch the first day who told us all about the bay and archipelagos, that was great! And while the schedule was quite packed, it still felt really relaxing. Oh - and don't worry about seasickness. I was super worried as I get nauseous on the slightest movement. I was completely fine, the bay is very calm. Thanks, Paloma!*Tip: We actually splurged and took a private car (they offer it) from Hanoi to Halong Bay and for multiple people (we had two), it was very much worth it."

            "review": "Exceeds expectations, memorable experience, three days of fun in Halong Bay. My family and I enjoyed cruising with Paloma Cruise (3D2N) on our trip to Halong Bay. We chose Paloma Cruise for its excellent reviews, and our experience on the cruise was the highlight of our stint at Halong Bay. The transfer from our hotel to Ha Long City was very punctual, and the drive from Hanoi to Halong Bay (about 4 hours) was smooth. Free wifi was available on the minibus ride, which was a major plus point. The minibus was very comfortable, with only 2 couples and our family in it - that's a total of 8 pax. Mineral water was given out. We stopped for half an hour at a huge store for toilet break + for us to get some snacks at the halfway point of our trip. Upon arriving at Ha Long Bay, the crew and Paloma staff took good care of us, and transferred our luggage to the cruise promptly. We were also ushered to the day trip to board the large cruise quickly. Crew was very polite and entertained us whilst waiting. Our family booked a Family Executive Suite. Room was rather spacious, even with an added extra bed. The balcony was a plus point - it was very wide and large, and gave us a private space to soak in the atmosphere of Halong Bay, Bai Tu Long Bay and Lan Ha Bay and the karst landscapes. We had a great time lying down on the beach chairs and admiring the sunset. I am an outdoors enthusiast, and enjoyed the array of activities at Paloma Cruise. On Day 1, shortly after we boarded the cruise and had lunch, we could choose as to whether we wanted to kayak around Bai Tu Long Bay, or take a bamboo boat to Vung Vieng Fishing Village. Everyone on my cruise chose the former. But if you're not too keen/unable to kayak, the bamboo boat to view the fishing village is recommended. Crew will make arrangements for both options. For the evening, there was a sunset party and a cooking demonstration. Great time to hang out on the deck and admire the sunset. The cooking demonstration was interesting - the crew taught us how to make Vietnamese spring rolls, which looks much harder than expected. Dinner time came shortly after, and you have the option of participating in squid fishing or chill in your room and/or in the cruise after that. On the whole, Day 1 was rather relaxed. Day 2 was more engaging for us. We took a day trip out to Lan Ha Bay and kayaked into the interior of some caves, which was beautiful. Would recommend all cruisers to kayak - these caves are only accessible via kayak, as the day trip is too big to enter these caves. Our friendly and experienced tour guide, Tom, took us to view beautiful caves, and he ensured everyone's safety. We had a BBQ lunch on a beach, following which we kayaked to Toi and Sang Cave and went exploring on foot into these two caves. We were the only ones there, so that was a plus point - you don't have to fight with other tourists to view these caves. And you get nice pictures! Haha! Evening activities for Day 2 were similar to those of Day 1, so it's your choice as to whether you want to join in or not. For me, I chose to relax on the deck to view the evening and night sky, which was an enjoyable and relaxing option. For Day 3, we took a day trip out to Sung Sot cave. Was very impressed by the cave, with its extensive limestone formations, stalagmites and stalactites. Choice of location (Sung Sot cave) was good, but the downside was that there were too many tourists and it was rather crowded. Following the visit, we headed back to the main cruise, packed, had our last lunch and bade farewell to the cruise and crew. If the array of activities on Paloma was great, the food served was excellent! Would say that the food was the highlight of the trip. We were served about 6-7 courses for lunch and dinner, with dishes like pumpkin soup (appetizer), wine prawns, grilled seabass, roasted chicken and desserts like apple crumble with ice cream. Seafood served was very fresh, and we were fed like kings. Wide variety of choices for breakfast too, though I would have preferred it if they served more Vietnamese food than the typical American breakfast options. Some Vietnamese spring rolls, xoi or egg coffee will be good. Enjoyed the BBQ lunch that was prepared on the beach on Day 2. That was something special, though it was rather chilly as the winds blew rather strongly at times.On crew performance and service - the crew on Paloma Cruise were friendly, efficient and rendered good customer service. Special shout to Harry, the cruise manager, for his management, coordination, advice and ability to engage cruisers. Tom, our tour guide, was also very friendly, experienced and funny, with his jokes about aspiring to be Tom Collins and Tom Cruise! The waiters and waitresses, bartenders and the rest of the crew, many of whom I did not know by name, were excellent as well. Everyone was happy to help and assist. On the whole, my family and I truly enjoyed our experience on Paloma Cruise, and we strongly recommend it to tourists visiting Halong Bay. It's value for money, and everything surpassed our expectations. Would recommend a 3D2N option to soak in the atmosphere at Halong Bay and Paloma Cruise. Thank you Paloma for the wonderful and memorable experience - you did great, and were the highlight of our short trip to Hanoi!"

Tour started with a pick up from our hotel in a private van with only two other couples. The long drive ahead (3.5 hours) was broken up with a stop at a very touristy, expensive gift shop. Once we arrived in Ha Long, we were transferred to our boat. The two days were very organized with lots of things to do. We were greeted on board with a 7 course, delicious lunch. We then chose to take the boat ride through the fishing village which was beautiful and relaxing (but we heard the kayaking was an amazing experience too). We were then given the opportunity to swim for a bit. Even though it is December (winter) the water was very warm. After, happy hour on the boat with dancing, music, card games and cooking class before dinner (another 7 course meal). Last of the night was squid fishing off the back of the boat before a few more drinks and bed. In the morning after a buffet breakfast, we went to The Amazing Cave for a tour, followed by brunch and the start of our return trip. Food was delicious and there was a LOT of it. Staff were extremely friendly, knowledgeable (even giving recos for things to do back in Hanoi) and fun. Room was great and clean, especially for a one night tour. We definitely recommend this tour and the boat to others. (Especially after hearing from others who chose a different cruise and had very poor experiences)"

The rooms were adequate and what you would expect on a boat. Comfortable beds and a large shower. The food was great and they catered for all needs. Whether a fussy eater or had allergies you were not forgotten. Nothing was to much trouble and you never went hungry. The staff on board where fantastic and look after your every need. Very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed an afternoon of Kayaking and swimming and in the morning got to explore a cave. The evening on the top deck saw a spring roll making competition which was a lot of fun as well as learning a new skill and we also got to meet and greet other passengers in a very happy and relax surrounding.

The boat is really nice. Nice wooden features, classic styling, clean. We stayed in a family suite which had a private balcony on the front of the boat and was a big enough room for 3 adults to share comfortably. The staff are friendly and helpful. Food is great. Each meal is several courses, and if you have any allergies or special requirements they will make a different option for you. The schedule of activities is quite busy, it felt like there was always something going on. Visit a floating village, try a cooking class, kayak, swim, eat eat eat! We were very glad to stay 3 days/2 nights because we were able to see more of Halong Bay and get away from all the other boats, as well as have time to relax. If you only stay one night you will miss the best parts of the trip! Our guides on the day boat Chan and Justin were lots of fun! The only negatives are the cost of drinks, and the packed schedule of activities (it was great to have so much included, but didn't leave much time for enjoying the private balcony!)"

We stayed for the 2 day 1 night cruise and absolutely loved it.Transfers - the included transfers to and from the Old Quarter in Hanoi took were in a nice minibus with air con and a safe driver. It took about 4 hours each way but with a rest stop half way through at a western style shop with clean toilets :)Boat - cabins were beautiful and luxurious. Hot rainfall showers and free toiletries. Comfy beds and ocean view. Excursions - all included the price, we went for a canoe ride around the floating villages and to a pearl farm. You can also do squid fishing at night. The next morning you go to the \"amazing caves\" and they really are amazing! Food - each Meal was comprised of several courses, which was great as the food was delicious and the activities make you hungry! They are able to cater for those with dietary requirements which is great. At each meal, a waiter delivered the food to the table and stated 'gluten free for you' when handing me a separate dish, which was very reassuring. I had to check a couple of times when it wasn't mentioned and most of the time it was actually suitable. The only things to watch out for if you're allergic/very sensitive are (a) the part of the dinner where the spring rolls are made for you at your table - there is cross contamination going on there! And (b) the breakfast buffet with all allergens everywhere and shared utensils and tongs - but that's a universal problem with buffets anywhere in the world. I got \"glutened\" sick from just eating the sliced fruit so lesson learned for me. Apart from that the allergen awareness is great on board.Staff - the staff are so polite, courteous and friendly. Tom Cruise is so funny and entertaining! "

Bear in mind I'm writing this on behalf of me, a Brit visiting Asia for the first time, and my other half and her family who are from Hanoi. We did the two day cruise and loved it. Accomodation - wonderful family room, balcony on the bow, comfy bed, clean, good bathroom. Very nice place to stay (although the reality of you're only in it for 7 hours!). Food - really good. I love Vietnamese food and my other half's family rated it too (and they are used to the finer things, as well as coming from a very traditional background with home made north Vietnamese food). The Boat - beautiful, what's not to like?The staff - soooo attentive, sharing and generous. They always gave us their time, advice, information and made sure we enjoyed our time with them. The activities - lunch on the cruise out, boat tour of the floating villages, visit a pearl farm (amazing!), and then a sun down part on the top deck (see photos). Finally, before dinner, a cookery competition on the top where we had such a laugh making spring rolls (which we then ate!). At night, cocktails in the warm evening air. We even grabbed a swim off the back of the boat. The next morning a lovely breakfast and then into some amazing caves. Incredible, before a gentle cruise back with brunch. All in all, a must if you are in the North of Vietnam, it's less than a couple of hours from Hanoi. Do it! Great value. Thank you Paloma!"

Just returned from an excellent two nights, three days trip on the Paloma Cruise.This is a 4* cruise and meets all expectations. (We seen some of the lower cost options during the trip and were glad we paid the extra, the old adage \"you get what you pay for holds true\".The memory of the trip apart from the stunning scenery of Halong Bay is the friendly warmth of all the staff throughout the trip and the never ending quantities of food......The journey for us started with an early departure from our hotel and you need to prepare yourself for an arduous almost three hour journey in a minibus. (after thirty minutes the hustle and bustle of early morning traffic wears off and you just want to sleep as the journey is quite monotonous). Our minibus had WiFi which was quite a surprise. !Food throughout is of good quality and plenty of it....The cabins are very functional and practical, do not expect five star, they do however meet all your needs. Free water is supplied in the cabin each day.Many people just came for the one night and regretted it....... two nights is to be recommended, to relax and really see Halong Bay.The second days trip to a remote bay to go canoeing, (we were lucky enough to see the monkeys), canoeing through caves, swimming and to cap it all a private beach barbecue........ this day was the highlight of the trip. Our guide for the day was Tom \"Cruise\" who was first class and we cannot thank him enough for all his efforts to make the day special.The holiday really begins when you arrive at the departure harbour, the number of cruise ships is quite a surprise.... and the organised chaos adds to the trip.We had a family cabin as there were three of us, it was a forward cabin with it's own terrace which was very pleasant.The first day is quite hectic as your always on the move, with the first trip to a fisherman's floating village (they row you around the fishing village etc in bamboo boats, remember to take some money to leave a tip for the boatman that rows you). The into a pearl exhibition area which has a \"huge\" and unexpected shop with all types and budgets of pearls, take lots of cash or credit card if tempted to buy something.In summary a first class way to see Halong Bay and I would happily recommend the Paloma cruise for it's friendly staff. Special mention also to crew members Stella and Harry."

            "review": "2Day/1N - Fabulous Service, Stunning Secluded Cruise. Whilst not the most luxurious or expensive cruise, it is so worth paying for a cruise of this level (4*) rather than opting for a more budget option. I was originally booked onto the V'Spirit Cruise due to our backpacking budget, thinking the surroundings would be enough but we saw the other boats, and I am so glad we payed just $20 more for this one! The difference is staggering! The condition of the boat, the service, the food, the side balconies and the top deck - everything makes the Paloma one of the best there is. People say that Halong Bay is busy and crowded. I know we were there at the beginning of High Season but what are they talking about? Go with Paloma, and they take you to the more remote parts, we kayaked through Vung Vieng Fishing Village and we had it to ourselves. We were around another boat for a while (Signature) but that was fine. Most of the time, we were alone in the beauty and it was perfect. (Apart from the cave on Day 2, that was quite busy)The facilities on board are fantastic, the food is incredible. It's 5* set menu restaurant stuff, just so different from every other meal we had on our backpacking trip! This was luxury, and a perfect way to end our travels in Vietnam. The activities are great and the staff handled us all with professionalism and superb attitude. I just kept thinking that if it was my job to deal with 20 tourists and keep them safe and following schedule, in the sea, I'd lose it. So the staff on Paloma have my utmost respect especially with people complaining that food had to be shared between a table, and they kept us to schedule with military precision. Who cares? I thought they did great.One minor criticism, we chose to go Kayaking and we had no idea where we were going or for how long. It was not made clear. We got lost from the group and were late back to the Pearl exhibition. I felt terrible for keeping people waiting and wished we'd have known a little more what we were meant to be doing. Obviously still a fantastic experience. Another thing - sort the wifi out! I want to post pictures to cause FB jealousy! Ha. Not crucially important but would've been nice to keep in touch.Thanks Paloma for a really great job. I don't envy you at all, but you remained professional, classy and in control. Oh and I won the cooking contest! So chuffed. I'd definitely 100% recommend this cruise to anyone looking to explore Halong Bay."

After reading reviews online, I decided to splurge a little and go on a well-reputed cruise ship for Halong Bay and it was well worth the money. Unlike many friends who said Halong Bay is over-rated and overly-touristy, I had a very pleasant and relaxed stay in Halong Bay.Everytime we get on / off the cruise, we were greeted warmly by the staff who took extra care and paid extra attention to every single passenger. It was a small group (maybe only around 20 of us) and the entire service crew made sure all of us felt very much at home. The itinerary was great - on the first day we visited some of the smaller islands with the option to kayak or be in a smaller boat, and on the second day we visited one of the caves (but it was terribly crowded). Other than the cave, we pretty much stayed away from the other cruises so it was only us. We had a family suite and the room looks freshly refurbished. Very clean and new. I love the private deck we had. The food was also very delicious. We were fed to the fullest at every meal. On the whole, it was a very relaxing trip. As we kept away from the other cruises, we had undisrupted scenery of the beautiful Halong Bay. It is definitely one of those trips where you kick back and relax and just enjoy the scenery."

From the moment we met our tour host/manager \"Mr Bean\" and \"Harry\" (names they suggested we use for them as they were easier than their Vietnamese names), we knew we were in for a fabulous and fun time! They were extremely enthusiastic about their jobs and went to great lengths to make sure our stay was perfect. Although the sky was overcast for our entire trip the views in Halong Bay were still beautiful, tranquil and breathtaking. They day tours provided, kayaking and cave walk were very well organised and interesting. On the boat we were treated to great service by the staff, a fun cooking class before dinner, complete with a light-hearted competition to see who could make the best spring roll, and more food than we could possibly eat! It was a perfect overnight experience and we fitted so much into the time it was amazing. Big group tours are not our preference so we enjoyed the experience with only a handful of other couples sharing the boat. Perfect."

The cabin is neat and clean. Actually the whole boat is neat and clean. Safety is a priority with Paloma. We visited the floating village, the Pearl Farm, Amazing Cave and went swimming next to the beach. It was a bit of a rushed schedule though if you're looking for a relaxing cruise where you lay about. Wifi was present at times, but very dodgy! It was only available in dining room. The cooking class is pretty cool and like a family cooking school. Kate came second in her master cooking skills.A good tour for the price ($120US or $170Aud)."

            "review": "Perfect choice for Halong Bay. We recently did the 3 days 2 nights with Paloma & it proved to be an amazing experience. If you can afford it we would strongly recommend doing the 2 nights instead of the 1 night. Day 2 was the highlight- as all the \"1 nighter's\" were being taken back to the mainland we were whisked away further into the bays for kayaking/swimming in crystal clear water followed by a BBQ on a secluded beach. Everything about the boat was great, amazing staff, clean comfortable rooms and the food! oh the food!...not only was it amazing but apart from the buffet breakfast every other meal was 6 to 7 courses! Traveller tip: Most people get some sort of shuttle transfer to/from Hanoi to the bay. Be prepared, it's an approx 4hr drive (with a toilet break) on possibly the craziest road I've ever been on. It's a pretty wild ride & a long one at that so it's a good idea to pack some snacks and water.Another good tip is to take a large bottle or 2 of water for the boat, it was really hot on our trip and along with alcohol you have to pay for bottled water. There are literally hundreds of cruise operators at Halong so choosing is difficult. All we can say is that Paloma were professional, accommodating and fun from start to finish, highly recommend!"

The service of Bin (our cruise director) was excellent. We also had great attention from Tom Collins (nickname) who took us kayaking, swimming and exploring, we then had a wonderful lunch on the beach.

You entertain us, feed us to much, constantly making sure we had a drink in our hand and are so friendly. The second day was my favourite, jumping off the boat, swimming on the beach, bbq on The beach with a beer and a few hours in the totally adorable spa. They go beyond any expectation you have on this boat. Tom took our camera whilst we were on the kayak to take photos of our family for us. My daughter has allergies and they had that covered and needed no reminders. The food- to die for!! You will not be left hungry!

This was thoroughly enjoyed and we would highly recommend the Paloma. As mentioned on many other posts there is sooo much food, each meal is a banquet !, the staff are great. The cabins are small (as you would expect) but comfortable. Just don\u2019t take too much luggage. We stayed in a deluxe room. I understand the only real difference between this and a standard room is the floor level. The boat has 4 levels. A roof top deck/bar area. Level 3 is where the restaurant and bar area is , level 2 has the deluxe room and level 1 is at water level , this is where you board the boat at the rear and is directly above the engine rooms. Not sure if noise is an issue for level 1 but I can say level 2 had great views. It is well worth staying an extra night. The 2 nights just seem to add more value after a long 4hr drive from Halong . Your intiniery is pretty full on a 1 night cruise. What happens with the 2 night cruise is you transfer on a smaller day boat while the larger boat takes the 1 nighter\u2019s back to shore and go exploring further out in the bay . There were only 4 of us on our particular day as it would seem most people only stay the one night. We did loads of swimming, kayaking though small caves in to amazing lagoons and cruised through some really beautiful locations. We were served a wonderful lunch on board (we choose his over a beach BBQ due to the wind at the time)."

At night we also had a cooking class and did squid fishing which was interesting. The bus picked us up from the hotel and after a 2-3 hr ride with a stop over we reached the boat.

Our room was a double room with a window out onto the bay. It was very clean and really did look like their photos on the website! We were fortunate to be the only guests which booked the 3day trip, so when everyone else left, we basically had a private tour on the second day until more guests arrived in the evening. It was amazing and we were very spoilt; kayaking around the bay followed by the guys cooking for us on a private beach, they even kayaked over a table and two chairs and set up lunch for us in the shade!! The food was really good and catered for vegetarians, there was so much, you really didn't go hungry! The only extra cost was drinks, which weren't excessively pricey. The only thing I was a little disappointed with was the 'cooking class' experience. This was basically just someone showing you how to roll a spring roll. This was the same on both nights.

Overall, we had a nice and fun experience with Paloma, which we used for a 2 days 1 night experience in the stunning Halong Bay. However, there are things that definitely could be improved.The tour itself was very beautiful and the nature out there, especially at the sunset, is simply breath taking!We picked Paloma cruises among the tons of possibility and we booked it through an agency in Hanoi airport, which for 160 USD each upgraded us to a suite. The suite was very nice and beautifully decorated, with a little living room and two big windows, nice! Air con was a plus as well, very much needed. However, regarding the room, the bathroom was unfortunately too humid and we found two insects. Now, I am not sure this was due to poor cleaning, since the bathroom did not seem dirty, they might just have entered because we left the window opened for get fresh air, or they might be a consequence of the really super humid environment. Probably something should be done to get the air drier.Coming to the other services, the tour we took was awesome, we sailed across the endless islands, visited a pearl farm and an \"amazing cave\" which was amazing indeed! About the latter, I think that considering the so infighting huge rock formations something more should be said by the tour guide instead of just pointing to close to real life shapes of the rocks. Nothing too tedious but just a few details more would probably be appreciated by many visitors.The service was smooth and very friendly, you can see they really wanted to make people feel comfortable . Also in the shuttle to and from Hanoi, we had a good time and meet interesting people in the group! The shuttle was a bit small but overall ok, they also had a problem on the the way back but were very helpful in helping us get to hanoi in time since we had a flight to catch. Finally, the good itself was superb! Nice selection and very tasty!"

The cabins are clean and comfortable and the food is outstanding (although there's too much of it! :)If possible, go for the 2 nights option as the second day provides a great opportunity to explore more remote areas of Halong Bay. We did kayaking and swimming in the spectacular location, getting there by a smaller day boat. We also visited 2 different caves - truly amazing; fishing village and a pearl farm (this is hardly a highlight though).Some improvement suggestions: more activities would've been good! Also getting to a different location each night, or at least cruising around the sunset time would've been much better as all of the boats concentrate in one parking lot every single night. Nevertheless we'd highly recommend Paloma Cruise!"

Mr Bean and Harry made this trip even more better. They talked with every customer as they were one big family There were fantastic 7 course lunch and dinner and it was very tasty and traditional Vietnamese food. As we were in Honeymoon, it was very very nice surprice, that stuff turned off lights, came in and sing to us :). Gave flowers and gift so thats what I can call personal service ! They really care of their customers so much and do their work from heart.Cruise program is also very good and interesting. Cabins are clean and very comfortable so no need to worry about that.Really can suggest Paloma cruises and thanks again Mr Bean, Harry and whole team, who made this trip unforgettable They really care of You !"

After scouring seemingly ENDLESS cruise companies for Halong Bay, we FINALLY decided to go with Paloma Cruises, and no regrets since!+++ FOOD +++Amazing menu for each meal. Great variety of food for people with all tastes. Especially loved the spring rolls (world's best! *wink*).+++ SERVICE +++The best staff. Our tour guide Tim was very knowledgeable about Vietnam, history, Hanoi, food, Halong Bay... I can go on... Turned the cruise into quite the educational experience for us.+++ ACTIVITIES +++Somehow, we lucked out and were the only group booked for a 3 day, 2 night tour, so on the 2nd day, Tim allowed us to choose what we wanted to do! We picked rock climbing, hiking, and kayaking, and he was like fairy godfather, granting our wishes! He even allowed us to jump off the boat (shh!). That's in addition to the cave tour and kayaking that is regularly scheduled. Great itinerary planning!+++ ROOM +++Very clean and comfortable, with breathtaking views.When I spoke to some friends about Halong Bay recommendations, they all told me they wish they spent more on a more luxurious experience, and now I know why. Would absolutely recommend the 3 day, 2 night tour for anyone. It's worth it!"

The food and staff were extremely good and memorable - appreciate the staff and waiters and Harry who was the perfect cruise manager. The rooms are clean and well decorated with room safe. Drinks are chargeable but prices are reasonable.Our room has a blocked toilet which was quickly remedied. the leaking aircon unit was noted but not fully repaired. 3 points to note:1. we went there during the hot summer months. on the trip back by van, the driver refused to increase the aircon fan speed even though the back of the van was very hot and stuffy. It was a hot stuffy 4 hour trip back to hanoi.2. our aircon was purposely left switched on as we wanted a cool room to return to but on two occasions the staff had switched it off . we found out when we complained to Harry.3. The purpose of the visit is to see the beauty of the Bay. I felt the cruise should have continued on to view other areas of the Bay especially during the sunset times to enjoy the views and breeze - instead the cruise moved on from port to the fish farm and kayak area and then rested in a parking area during the sunset surrounded by many boats and cruises."

From the moment we were picked up from our accommodation in our Air Conditioned transport to the the moment we were dropped off this company and the Vietnamese people truly do their best to make the experience a good one. We only did the overnight stay but wished we had done two nights. You get to cruise, eat , drink and explore the best of Vietnam. The weather when we went was 40 degrees so some more swimming time would have been good.The host \" Mr Bean\" was very efficient but he needs some work on his comedy routine and singing!!"

Transferred by a comfortable, air conditioned car from our hotel in Hanoi to and from the cruise which was stress free. Our cruise was well organised with plenty of activities to fill the day but did not feel rushed at all. Kayaking to visit a floating fishing village, swimming, squid fishing and a cave visit. I was very impressed with the accommodation for a boat. There is not much room to spare, but there's barely any need to be in your cabin other than for a shower and sleep. I doubt there are any rooms that don't provide a beautiful view whilst cruising through Halong Bay. The food was very nice, all new to me as it was Vietnamese and I enjoyed every dish. More impressively, each dish was adapted for my partner's wheat allergy so she never missed a course, never mind a meal. The staff were fantastic. I had lost my camera some where en route to the cruise and 'Harry' tracked it down for me and managed to get it returned to me once we were back ashore. The whole staff are incredibly friendly, professional and a joy to be around."

The cabin/suite consisted of a large bedroom with private, very nice, bath, and a sitting room. The air conditioner in the sitting room refused to power on when we arrived. Cruise Director \"Harry\" got it working, once I was able to make him understand the situation. I suspect it was a tripped circuit breaker that was at fault. It happened again, on the second day of the cruise, after a power outage that only lasted a few seconds. One of our bags was delivered to our cabin, then removed while we were at lunch. Again, Harry was able to rectify the problem, but these things prevent me from giving Paloma a 5 star rating. In truth, I doubt that any of these boats really deserve 5 stars, because none of them seem capable of keeping up with the maintenance needed. But, the food and service were 5 star. The excursions were standard. I don't believe they vary much from one boat to another, but they were enjoyable."

Everything was super easy from pick-up to drop off, and the staff on board are incredible. Our guide, Harry, who had just become manager, went above and beyond to make sure that every little detail of our trip was perfect. He and the whole staff were so welcoming, friendly, and fun to be around. We really enjoyed their company. The boat itself is beautiful as well- the rooms are very clean and nice, and more than I would expect from an average cruise ship. The food is delicious too, and there is so much of it! My boyfriend has a shellfish allergy, and for every course that had shrimp, they brought him a separate, personalized dish to replace it. The activities are so much fun- we liked kayaking best- and they keep you busy. We were a little worried that we would get board being on the boat so much, but that was not the case! Thanks to Paloma Cruises- don't hesitate to book with them!"

Transfer from Hanoi took approx 3.5-4 hours in an air conditioned van with wifi. We booked the family suite which is the only room type with an excellent balcony with sun lounges so I recommend you book this room! But all the other public deck areas were great too. The food is excellent and it is crazy how many courses they serve. The boat is beautiful and really well looked after. We did the 3 day/ 2 night which I would highly advise (if the weather is the right season) as those who stayed 1 night seemed a bit rushed for our liking. We were lucky to have all sunshine so the swimming and kayaking and day trips were all perfect. The staff are just next level - thanks to Mr Bean, Harry and Phuc for looking after us. Would recommend to anyone and everyone."

Took 2 hours to rectify this. Totally different to our return transfer which was a lot more comfortable. We were welcomed by ground staff and Mr Bean (our tour guide) with smiles and warm welcome. The tender from Halong to the boat was easy and safe. Strong hands at the ready if there's a problem. Taken to the dining room for welcome drink, cold towel and key distribution. After a quick trip to cabins and to freshen up it was time for lunch.....a 7 course lunch! This started a major food fest for the next 24 hours delivered by the ever smiling Tian. The food was great but there was a lot of it. Each table would have left at least half the evening meal as there was just so much. All meals were great in quality and presentation. You get asked how the food is by three different people within 10 minutes of each other which is a bit overbearing but it's what they are asked to do so you have to accept that. My biggest reservation is it felt regimented at times with an expectation by the crew that you were to do everything that was planned - trip to the fishing village, cooking class, squid fishing and 'amazing cave' trip. Not everyone goes on a cruise to do everything planned by the company. Cabins were clean and comfortable. Not huge in size but ok for a night. The family suites have a balcony area which is great if you want to spend the money. A good time and it was great to finally get to Halong Bay."

We were picked up by Paloma Cruises from our hotel at the time stated, the van was comfortable and even had wifi for our journey to the port.Joining the boat went without a hitch, the cabin more than adequate with fresh fruit and a mini bar. The boat was of a very high standard with a crew to match. They were very friendly and helpful and went out of their way to please.The highlight was the food. It was wonderfully presented, it was plentiful, it was tasty and every course was explained to the diner. There was beer and wine available for purchase at a reasonable price.We were able to kayak, swim in the bay and visited the caves for a guided tour. I didn't hear any complaints nor did I have any.Even though Halong Bay was full of other boats on their various cruises at no time did it feel crowded or too touristy. The different companies obviously had different times to do the events and we at no time felt rushed or hustled. We really enjoyed an adventure we entered with some trepidation."

The itinerary said that it moored at a different place on the second night, but it didn't and it was never intended that it was. Because the Paloma has people on for both one and two night cruises, it always moors at the same place with a squillion other tour boats. We were very disappointed in this.Having said that, we did get to go further into the bay on the second day and spend 2 lovely hours kayaking in complete peace and quiet. It was lovely. The weather wasn't great, so we had to have our barbeque lunch on the boat - but can't blame the operator for the weather! The lunch was terrific.The boat itself was OK. Cabins were nice, and plenty of hot water - but they were the hardest beds I have ever experienced. Beds are generally much firmer in Vietnam, and I quite like them, but this was like sleeping on a blank of wood! The staff tried to help by putting extra duvets under the sheets for the second night, which I guess helped a little.The food on the boat was consistently excellent. The staff were generally very good, if a little over the top at times.Overall, a worthwhile trip - but make sure you are getting what you think you are if you are going for 2 nights!"

We booked a private 2 night 3 day cruise with Paloma Halong Bay Cruises for our family of 5 which includes three children of varying ages. The private cruise was ideal for a family as they can cater for special family interests and needs and offer flexibility if you have younger kids. You also do not have to worry so much about your kids annoying other guests (even if well behaved) who may not want kids around so parents can have a more relaxing time. While Halong Bay is a very busy place with numerous cruise companies and boats on offer we couldn't fault Paloma. The crew and personal guide treated us wonderfully. The food was fantastic although far too much - we counted 27 courses all up over three meals! Lunch and dinner was largely Vietnames and breakfast offered a good range of western and Vietnames dishes. We certainly were not hungry. The boat was very comfortable with two private cabins sleeping three in each if needed with ensuite bathrooms. The roof deck had sun and shade areas and there were games on board. The usual activities were on offer which were thoroughly enjoyed (kayaking, Amazing cave, lookouts, floating fishing/pearl villages and school, swimming, spring roll cooking class), but our kids also enjoyed fishing with the staff (and caught plenty) and a lesson in how to fold serviettes in impressive ways! We were not that keen to swim, however, as much of the water in the bay in which the cruise boats operate is polluted with oil/fuel leaks and rubbish (mostly from tourists - please take your rubbish with you and don't spoil this beautiful part of the world!). The kayaking was fantastic though. Thanks to all the staff that made this experience so special. Paloma highly recommended."

The bedrooms were a good size, had air conditioning, hot showers with good pressure, and lovely windows you could open to let the breeze in. The food was amazing and you never went hungry. Wifi is available on the boat and there are movies played in the common area. The pace of the cruise was also good. We had all ages and fitness levels on the cruise and you could choose to do things or hang out of the boat. I would say most people on the cruise were 35+ so if you are looking for young people to hang out with or party, I would suggest a different operator.It is nearly a 5hr trip to the boat from Hanoi so I found a 2 night stay was best as it allowed enough time to recover from the drive."

The cabins and bathrooms were also of a high standard.

My only reason for 4 is related to the full day between the two nights - the itinerary said we would have barbecue lunch on beach and guide said that due to tide, we would just eat on the smaller boat we were on with 7 of us. If really the tide it would be an issue frequently and I don't understand why would call out on the itinerary (which we made boat selection based-on). Maybe not worth it for our small group? Also wish better understanding of what we could 'bring' for that full day away from boat. Loved our little gift at end and overall wonderful!"

Speaking of eating - the food was great, we did a one night cruise so we had 4 meals and they were all delicious. The only meal I didn't fully enjoy was the last one where they tried to make a westernized dish, which was very tasty - but I'm in Vietnam and would rather have Vietnamese food!The one night cruise took us to the floating village - which was neat, but nothing crazy.

We had set off about 8.30 a.m. to sail to new location so we could kayak which was good. We had finished by 12 midday,had lunch on boat, because we could not go on beach for bbq or swim because of mist which was understandable, but unfortunately there was nothing else in place for us to do except sit and talk for approx. 3 hrs . We could not go back before 3.30pm as the big boat had not returned with new guests. There was nothing to do until drinks before dinner. Next day we visited amazing cave, which was crowded and far too rushed aseveryone had to be back tohave early lunch. We think a little more thought should be given into the itinerary for 2night/3 day guests if the weather is not good. We felt the 24hr trip would have given us better value for money. We know the companycannot control the weather but they can control the itinerary if the weather is not favourable. We think people should b aware that there are changovers of guests all the time and the groups of people are fragmented and you will not be with the same complete group of people you came on board with. Luckily, our little group of six got on very well - just as well if you are left to talk for 3 to four hours!!."

            "review": "Truly lovely cruise on a spectacularly beautiful bay. We chose Paloma after reviewing a variety of options. This particular company/boat was supposed to be just a level or two below the absolute luxe top-of-the-line. We were more than pleased with our choice. The boat was beautiful and the service extremely capable and friendly. The food was generous and quite good--each meal seemed to have four or five courses.My only critique would be that they scheduled a few too MANY activities for guests (spring roll culinary lesson, cave tour, squid fishing), and since the boat was not completely full, we did not feel comfortable begging off. But it would have been nice to have more time to just relax on the deck and take in the amazing setting, as one really only has about a day on the bay, between getting to the boat in the afternoon, then having to leave by late morning the next day. I myself was fighting off a cold so I did skip the activities in favor of relaxation, and was very glad I had that excuse! All in all, a wonderful experience, and I would love to go back for longer next time. Halong Bay is hyped so much, a visitor to Vietnam may wonder if it is worth it. It absolutely is!Full disclosure: We were lucky with the weather, mild and partly cloudy with beautiful light, as our companions had done it once before when it was cold and damp, and it was apparently not quite so wonderful then. So that may be a bit of an issue, but, if the forecast seems at all decent, don't miss it!"

The food was very acceptable and well presented. The trips from the boat were also very good. However, it was not warm enough to go for a swim, but otherwise did everything else recommended. The coach journey is possibly the only draw back getting to Halong Bay, but not as bad as we had envisaged."

Excellent: food/drink, organization, quality of excursions/sights were absolutely beautifulGood: tour guides, rooms, atmosphere, serviceAverage: We would've liked a few more excursions, some of the excursions on the itinerary were less exciting that advertised, and there were never any announcements during the cruise about good times to take photos, when we were passing by certain landmarks, etc. English level of staff could have been better. The itinerary changed a lot (tai chi master on vacation, low tide prevents us from going to certain areas, failure to indicate that the sailing path is actually the same on both days"

We did 2 nights, 3 days with our two kids and my parents. Tim met us in Hanoi and travelled with us to Halong Bay. He gave an excellent overview of the city and answered our questions not just on the road trip but during our entire stay. The staff was so friendly and always remembered our kids' names. We did the bamboo boat through the fishing villages but kayaked the following day to the beach. My son and husband had fun jumping from the boat and swimming in the bay (a little too cold for me). We also did squid fishing each night that was enjoyable. Overall, Halong bay was our favorite part of the Vietnam vacation."

Firstly, travelers to Hanoi need to understand that a trip to Halong Bay is a four hour car ride along bumpy roads and there is nothing to see during the trip. The car ride is not through beautiful country side so many people may not want to do a Halong Bay excursion. If you choose to do so, consider doing a 3 Day, 2 Night trip to make the car ride worth it.However, if you decide to take the plunge, then Paloma cruise is a great option. You can find the detailed itinerary on their website and the team executed perfectly against the itinerary - if you like the activities on the agenda you will enjoy the trip. The boat is well maintained and the cabins are clean. The staff is fantastic, especially Mr. Phuc (spelling?) the waiter - he works very hard to make sure that you have a great experience.The boat had a drink special - buy 2 get one free. The kayaking, happy hour, cooking class, thai chi, and cave tour were all fun activities. In the evenings you can also do squidd fishing off the back of the boat. Overall we had a great trip and would recommend this tour company."

Oh and the next morning myself,and my friend both threw up and felt really run down. Didn't have lunch that day, and had to spend another night in Ha Long Bay, as we were really ill.

The hotel pick-up worked well and we arrived on time to board the cruise. The rooms on the ship were very nice and I was positively surprised. Comfortable bed, locker, private bathroom, AC etc. The offered food was for the most part very good and very filling (several courses for lunch and dinner). I also liked the staff, which was motivated and enthusiastic to make the cruise a good experience for everyone. The cocktail party with free sangria and fruits at sunset was a wonderful experience too. Very beautiful views of the bay and all the islands. The activities were great too and I particularly enjoyed the kayaking/boatride with a local around the floating fisher village. The cave the next day was also impressive, but it was very crowded due to the many tourists. For the future, if possible it could be nice to visit another cave or see another part of Halong Bay that is less touristy. I would definitely recommend this tour when you visit Halong Bay."

Tai Chi on the top deck in the morning was a lovely way to get into day ahead and the sights were incredible. I could sit and watch the scenery all day and not get bored, whilst the caves and floating villages are fascinating. Take a kayak if you can - the water's warm (even in winter)."

Having the extra night is well worth is as the trip out to Ha Long from Hanoi is about 3-4 hours. We knew the weather was going to be a bit hit or miss so we booked a suite so would have a living areas to chill out in if the weather was bad. Well worth the extra and I would recommend it even if the weather was good as the view from the panoramic window is spectacular. The food on the boat was excellent and authentic, you never went hungry. The highlight of the trip has to be our tour guide Danny, he was funny and informative, answering all the unusual questions we could think of about life in Vietnam! I liked that the boat was small as you got to know everyone, some other boats we saw were floating mega hotels not befitting of the environment. The booking team were also good, helping to arrange transport back to the airport directly after the leaving the boat."

The trip would have felt too short otherwise, and we wouldn't have seen enough of the bay. We also spent time in Bai Tu Long Bay, which was less crowded than Ha Long, which was great. Our tour guide, who picked us up in Hanoi and stayed with us throughout the cruise, was friendly and helpful, as was all of the staff on the boat. The boat was cozy and clean, and we had some of the best nights' sleep of our trip on the boat. The food started out great and became just okay by the end, but there was more than enough to eat. The kayaking on Day 1 and 2 was the highlight -- because we booked two nights, we had the entire middle day to kayak and hang out on a beach. The tours of the pearl farms and Surprise Cave we could have done without, but as far as we could tell, they're something all tours do, not specific to Paloma. Ha Long Bay was beautiful and worth the trip from Hanoi. Alcohol isn't included in the tour; the beer and cocktails were decent, the house wine was pretty bad. I'd recommend Paloma to anyone looking for a cruise of Ha Long Bay."

Magical!Docking in the bay for the night with all the other boats, I thought, was stunning - all the lovely white boats all lit up against the Halong bay backdrop was like being in Sydney harbour at New Year's Eve!Kayaking and swimming was fantastic on our second day - definitely worth doing the two night tour. One night would not have been long enough.ConsThere was not always hot water available in the shower.Every minute of the cruise was planned and allocated for an activity - it would have been nice to have some more time to sit on the deck and watch the bay, read etc. Rooms were not made up after the first night - not a huge issue but worth noting.The cave visit was very disappointing - there were hundreds of other tourists there and it was like being in line at Disneyland. We were stuck at the same dining table every night and we were always sitting with other guests. We aren't antisocial but it would have been good to have a two person table. We tried to move but were told we weren't allowed to! Very silly. All in all, we had an enjoyable time but I wouldn't go again. I would spend the extra couple of hundred dollars and go on one of the more upmarket boats."

The cooking class was short but fun, the crew and general atmosphere very welcoming, facilities excellent, food very good and the tai chi class at dawn very enjoyable and relaxing. I enjoyed the second day a bit less, as Halong Bay was way too crowded and after we visited the caves we were sailing very slowly and close to the coastline, so we didn't get to enjoy the scenery that much. All in all, though, it was a great experience and yes, it is touristy for some parts, but, if you still decide to do it, Paloma could be a perfect compromise!"

Finally decided on Paloma, as they could accommodate our no-seafood no-shellfish family, and they had a room for my three teenagers. Sounded perfect!The boat is big enough for 40+ people, but small enough that we made some really great friends. We had so much fun with our new friends, so many laughs and fun times, it was really something. Put 40 people on a boat for three days with no wi-fi, and real conversations take place! The rooms were terrific. My daughter ended up rooming with my hubby and I, refusing to dorm up with her brothers. Teenagers, huh! So it ended up being a bit cramped for the three of us, in hindsight I should of just paid for a third room. It worked out fine though, we really only went to the room to sleep, there were so many other things to do. The meals were fantastic, and the staff very accommodating and true to their word, they made beef or chicken substitutes for my family. It was delicious! We brought extra snacks with us, as my teen boys are always hungry, and wow! we never needed them, they ate so much at meal time! The cokes, bottled waters, and beers were extra, but were so reasonably priced! Thanks for that!!The activit\u00e9s were so much fun, we enjoyed kayaking around the pearl farm (although our kayak smelled like something had died in it .. it was really awful, but ended up being really funny as my hubby and I had fits of giggles while we were trying to paddle). The cooking class ended up being a contest, and was so much fun with our hilarious new friends from England, I nearly had to change my clothes afterwards. We were a pretty rambunctious group, and the staff just rolled with it, they were never phased by us. Not even when we were squid fishing and chanting \"whiskey whiskey whiskey\". On day two, at a private bay with our own beach, we found ourselves jumping off the top deck of the boat into the crystal clear water! We really had a great time, made memories that will last forever, and met some new friends who will be lifetime friends. Thanks Paloma for such a great cruise!!"

            "review": "Amazing views and quality service. We did the 2 nights three days with Palmoa Cruise. We booked the cruise at the airport as we had nothing organised for Ha Long Bay but wanted to do a cruise. We were picked up at our airport by Tim. On the way to the boat Tim informed us of many aspects of Vietnam. We introduced ourselves on the bus which broke the ice for all of us to chat. We stoped once on the way to the bus for a break as the journey to the boat is 3 and half hours. When we got to the quay we were transferred by tender boat to the bigger boat. We were given our room keys. The room was a nice size. We got the deluxe room. The boat is big with 3 floors and a sun deck on the roof. We had lunch and then we on route for the floating village. This was really interesting. We opted for the bamboo raft instead of the kayak. We were transferred back to the boat for a sunset party and dinner. We ended up having drinks with a couple we had met on the bus. The next day we were lucky as we were the only 2 on the 2 night trip so basically had a private tour the next day around a beautiful beach and kayaked around amazing caves. The food on the boats was amazing. Nearly too much. We were so full. Make sure to let them know if you don't eat a certain food group. They cater for everything. The 2nd night we took it easy and other passengers joined. The 3rd day we were brought to amazing caves 130 steps up from the sea. It was back to the ship again for check out and transfer back to Hanoi. The service on the ship was brilliant. Phuc and Hong were lovely waiters and very friendly. Tim our tour guide was very friendly and knowledgeable. He made plenty of time to talk to us and made sure we were well looked after. We had a problem with the air con the 2nd night but we were quickly transferred to another room for the night and let to leave our bags in the other room. Turns out we were transferred to a suite which was a bigger room and had a balcony. The only thing i would say is that it would have being nice to have our room made up on the 1st morning but I guess it shows the security and privacy of no one in your room. We were told there was wifi at the airport but there isn't any on the boat but it was nice not to have a phone for 3 days"

I originally was booked in for a overnight cruise of Ha Long Bay with another boat, but due to neccessary repairs I was transferred over to the Paloma at no extra cost. All I can say is that I wish I could of stayed forever on the boat.I had a free updgrade to the luxury cabin & the staff, especially Loi were amazing. Five stars all the way. This will be one of the most beautiful memories of my life, cruising a beautiful region of the world on a magnificent boat and wonderful staff.How they managed to produce the food in such a small kitchen was an eye to behold. The silence of Ha Long Bay, not being interrupted by phones and televisions and the crowds made me appreciate the time alone and helped me to refocus on the things that are important."

They do a really good job accommodating dietary requests. The crew made everybody feel comfortable by allowing us to eat together the first night. However as we were staying longer we were at a separate table the second night when the new 1 night group came which was a bit of a shame. The one issue we had was ourBus ride back to Hanoi. There was a mix up on the address so we were dropped off at our previous hotel, the driver refused to take us to the correct address and drove off...a let down to an otherwise enjoyable trip."

We were supposed to go on a larger ship, but the day before the travel agent informed us the ship we were to take needed repairs, so Paloma cruises switched us to their family boat at no charge. We were not sure what to expect, but we were BLOWN AWAY by the cruise. The ship had 2 bedrooms, one for us and one for our daughter- so we had a private ship with 6 lovely crew members attending to us. The cruise was AMAZING - the best food we had in Vietnam... all cooked in a tiny kitchen at the back of the boat. Every meal the dishes just kept on coming... there was no way we could eat all the food. Our bar tender, TAM was one of the nicest people we met in Vietnam. He taught us how to care a rose petal from a carrot and was always smiling and laughing with us. All the crew members were excellent and we felt so at home on the ship... so much so that we were sorry to leave. The ship was excellent all around. I highly recommend this company!"

            "review": "2 nights 5 friends happy days on Paloma. We did the 2 night cruise with some added extras, thanks to Ms Huyen Putri, who made booking a breeze! Arriving in Hai Phong the day before the cruise we had a private transfer to a hotel before the cruise and transport to the harbour on the day of the cruise, all on time in comfortable mini vans. All the cruises appear to follow the same format, you are actually on the boat for around 48hrs. Day one cruise is sailing around the bay, off to either kayak or bamboo boat, sunset drinks, dinner and settling in to your cabins.Day two we attended the day trip to the beach, kayaking, swimming and BBQ lunch, then freetime approx 2hrs, sunset drinks and dinner. Day three we went to the cave, cruised back to the harbour, had an early lunch and then disembarked, for transfer to Hanoi. The positivities were the bay it's beautiful...Locals and tourists are doing a great job trying to clean it (We did a rubbish collection on the beach, as did the other tourists on the day we were there)The staff on Paloma: David and Linc were especially nice, funny and friendly. Waitstaff spoke great English and were attentive. The rooms are nice and maintained to a pretty good standard, not 100% but it must be hard when the turnover is high and your on a boat! The food was tasty and plentiful, my only comment is that the rice should be brought out at the start of the meal so you can enjoy it with the meats and vegetables. Things I believe they can work on are: that we did not have rain or wind on the day trip, and they still canceled the beach BBQ......Every morning was a very early start, could be room to sleep a little later. The whole cruise seemed a little rushed, maybe let people eat breakfast till 8am as per the itinerary instead of packing it away at 7:45am. More free swimming time after the day trip we were told we could not swim till 4:30 leaving only 45min free swim time each day! Open the top deck bar at night, so we can stay up a little latter in the night and enjoy the views. I would recommend Paloma, the standard was high, people friendly, food and drinks nice (every 3rd drink free) Thanks for a memorable trip"

            "review": "Halong has great potential.. My wife and I are in our mid to late 30's and have travelled quite extensively around the world utilizing hostel type accommodation right through to 5 star.I didn't have massive expectations for the cruise as it was an over nighter with a bit of an itinery packed in. The drive from Hanoi is about 3 hours or so in an air conditioned van that was fairly comfortable and there was a rest stop along the way which is the usual tourist trap filled with over priced trinkets and food, but the toilet facilities were good.On arrival we sat for about 20 minutes before boarding the tender boat to the Paloma. Everyone was made to wear life jackets which is good but I don't know if they would do any good in an emergency situation, similar to the motor bike helmets which are more for aesthetics rather than serving a purpose.The cruise to the first stop \"Floating Fishing Village\" was nice. But I would have to agree with other reviews in that the water is full of rubbish and there are oil slicks every where from all the boats (I also contributed to this by taking the tour).I would suggest taking a kayak rather than going on the bamboo boat as you have more control of what you see as the boats just paddle through a ya reasonable pace and don't really go near the caves etc so the photo opportunities are limited. It is nice to paddle around as well and do some exercise, but you are best wearing clothes that can get a little wet.On returning to the boat we had a swim which I reluctant to do at first because of the pollution, but I was glad I went in because it was refreshing. For those that are not confident swimmers I would suggest a flotation device because of the current. I thought the experience would have been better if Paloma provided some floating lounges just to lie back and relax.The meals were good, and the company provided meals suited to dietary requirements which was nice.The inboard entertainment was lacking which I think needs to be looked at. I can appreciate that some people just want to sit and read a book but others like myself would like to socialise, have a couple of drinks and maybe listen to some music or play a game of pool. The top deck is perfect for that but is under utilized. However we bumped into a couple of groups of people that made the evening fun.The Amazing Cave was nice but very touristy and as other people have commented, people are ushered through like sheep. The best part of that morning was walking out the other end and looking at all the seafood caught by the locals (I suppose if you have seen one cave you have seen them all.Our Paloma suite was nice, clean and roomy. Don't be fooled by having a room safe as it is not secured to anything and could easily be picked up and taken away and then oped as it is secured by a small pad lock.I think the suites need a spa bath in the viewing room rather than the two couches and coffee table but that is just my point of view.I would have to say it was mostly enjoyable but it is not something I would do again and I definately don't think the boat, service or facilities were worth the money.I suppose western expectations are different to eastern ones.I was very disappointed with the room dedicated to relaxing as once you are kicked out of your room there are two couches to sit on in the dining area which is in the air conditioning. The only other option. Is sitting on the hard wooden chairs in the dining room or the chairs on the upper deck in the rain or the humid undercover area. I was basically kicked off the couches during the last day as I was trying to relax because some other tourists decided that they wanted to eat I there instead of the dinning room and the staff made me feel unwelcome.I think the Paloma definately needs an upgrade as the upper deck has quite a bit of give in the floor boards. The wall tile in our shower was broken and a large section was just resting above head height.I would have liked to just relax rather than doing some of the activities but the staff seemed quite militant about times and what the guests should be doing.The end price for 2 half hour massages, a dozen beers and sine fruit shakes was just under 1.8 million dong which is pretty expensive for the country but is to be expected in a touristy area.I strongly believe that the tour companies and officials for Halong need to clean up the water ways restore what is potentially a very beautiful part of the world. I am sure the money we paid could go towards an extra staff member to row around the bay and collect the floating rubbish. If every boat that visited did this the bay would be clean in no time as there are hundreds of boats visiting every day."

            "review": "Very well looked after, but prepare for your trip to be diminished by other tourists. First things first, Halong Bay is a beautiful place.Second things second, over the last 20 years, it's developed into something of a tourist trap. Which is a big shame because (like Angkor Watt) the sheer numbers of visitors detract pretty significantly from what makes Halong Bay special in the first place. I thought this would be one of the absolute highlights of a 4 week trip around Indochina. And to be honest I was a little underwhelmed.Despite some of the attempts to differentiate one cruise company from another, from what I could tell, there isn't much to separate them. They all follow pretty much the same fixed routes and itinerary. All you're really paying for is a better standard of boat, staff and food.We chose to push the boat out (excuse the pun) by selecting Paloma Cruise. It's towards the premium end - and for this we were housed on a beautiful vessel, were served by some very attentive staff and were given great quantities of very tasty food. However, you didn't have to look very hard to realise that you're just part of the relentless conveyor belt that will ultimately spoil Halong Bay - which made me feel slightly guilty for being part of the problem. Paloma is beginning to get a bit tatty around the edges. It's now four or five years old now, and is in need of a little TLC. The varnish is beginning to flake off in places, and the soap dish was hanging off the wall in one of our rooms. All perhaps signs that the punishing and relentless schedule are all taking their toll. At points I felt the pre-eminence of the unrelenting schedule became too dominant - with the ship needing to be in certain places at certain times of the day - with the upshot being that we felt quite rushed to finish one part of the itinerary and get on with the next. On the upside, our main chaperone, Tim was very attentive and informative. He spoke excellent English and offered some great insights into life in Vietnam and Halong Bay.And a big shout to Phuc, one of the waiters on board the Paloma. He was, without doubt the friendliest and smiliest person we met in the whole 4 weeks we spent in Indochina. He was extremely helpful and attentive. The world needs more people like Phuc!Some of the activities were great. The canoeing was fun, as was the beach visit and the trip to the floating markets and seeing where they fished for pearls and cultured them. But I was pretty under-whelmed with some of the other activities. I was really looking forward to the squid fishing and the cookery class. But both turned out to be 'froth' rather than anything more substantive. The cookery class lasted all of 10 minutes and amounted to nothing more than putting the pre-prepared ingredients onto a sheet of rice paper, and rolling it into a spring roll. And the squid fishing was just a lucky dip, dangling a length of bamboo with a line lashed to it over the side of the boat and hoping for the best. Within a quarter of an hour everyone had given up; and no-one bothered to take it up on the second night. And the amazingness of the Amazing Cave visit was totally compromised by the fact that it was a total tourist trap with a constant procession of tour groups. I'd rather not have bothered.Watch out for the cost of drinks on the boat. I'd expect a bit of a mark-up, but we were paying pretty much double and in some cases three times what you'd pay for the same drinks in Hanoi. You will get a small bottle of complementary water every day, but given the heat and humidity, this isn't sufficient - so you'll end up forking out extra for paid water. Surely unlimited complimentary water isn't too much to ask for guys, when we're paying premium prices for the cruise. Perhaps this could be paid for by cutting back on the amount of food which was served. It was all very tasty, but each meal consisted of 9 to 11 courses and we always left at least a third of our food because we couldn't fit it in! Other guests were the same. And our first night was spoiled by a rude and ghastly (Brazilian?) family, with nanny in tow, and absolutely no sense of decorum or the fact that they were sharing a space and experience with a group of other people. OK - I know Paloma have no control over who comes on their boat (in fact, the captain dealt with them very well, with courtesy and grace). But it was a reminder of how much your enjoyment of trips like this is at the mercy of other guests."

The scenery and beauty of Halong Bay is there for all to see and is self evident but a private tour is most definitely worth the few extra dollars to accentuate the experience. The food was excellently prepared, artistic, and most delicious. I agree with other reviews that it was almost too much. But that is never a problem. Perhaps abort the departure lunch at 10:45 AM after a FULL breakfast at 7:30 AM. Paloma cruise is professional throughout and I highly recommend them."

At the port we handed our luggage over and boarded small boats to be taken to the Paloma. The crew were smiling and waving ready to greet us. We were given refreshments and a short talk about the boat and general information. Our luggage was taken to our cabin for us. Couldn't fault the boat at all. Food was great (lots of it) service was good and the boat was clean, in good condition and really nicely decorated. It felt pretty special to be honest. The activities give you a good opportunity to chat to other people on the boat. Id say kayaking around the floating village was the highlight. Those that would rather sit back and relax had the choice to board a bamboo boat instead. Our group was actually the only other people at the village, aside from the villagers themselves. Id say the amazing cave was pretty dull, but I'm not that into rock formations, some might like it. We did have a guide who was with us throughout the 2 day tour. I struggle to remember his name but he was friendly, knowledgeable and spoke very good English. Didn't get up early enough for the Tai Chi, wish I had, would have been nice on the deck in the morning! All in all, we had a great time, ticked all the boxes for us!"

Paloma Cruise is an attractive option because on the first day, they venture to Bai Tu Long Bay, a far less touristy portion of the bay. It was such a treat to not see any other cruise ships all afternoon until sunset. We particularly enjoyed kayaking and swimming in the bay. Our cruise was around half full, and they graciously upgraded everyone they could. The guests were mostly couples or families.With only 2 days/1 night on the ship, I recommend not doing everything on the packed itinerary. While they do tell you that everything is optional, it certainly doesn't feel that way. I would skip : the cooking demonstration, the squid fishing, the cave visit the next day. There's very little relaxation time, which is counter intuitive. Force yourself to say no!The ship is in good shape and we were more than satisfied with the rooms. They almost served too much food! The service of the staff is fine, though we felt that some of the workers didn't want to be there. Regardless, we were happy with our experience and only wished we were on the water longer!"

I had to call them the day before the tour to confirm the booking and to confirm that they were going to pick us up and to confirm the time. I had thought that they might have done that by email?It takes a few hours to get out to the boat but they are great at getting you out and boarded as quickly as possible. We had a welcome drink on board and then sat down for an introduction. I found this a bit forced and felt like we were being fed some propaganda as to why Paloma was so good, but hey, its a cut throat industry and they want to make sure we have the best time.We were fed lunch immediately following the into introduction - It was a 7 course set meal which never seemed to end. All of the food was included but we had to purchase all drinks including water.(I thought that some complimentary water might have been nice however everything had to be purchased and we were a captive audience with no other option).The rooms on board were nice and had air con which was great. We went for the basic room, and thought they were fine. you don't end up spending any time in your room anyways, so we didn't see the point in spending more.We were told that we could do as we want but it felt like this was not the case and that everything was very regimented. More free time would've been nice just to take in the beauty of it all. I understand the difficulty in getting us to see everything. I also think that there could have been more information provided and more explaining of the history. It was brief when we got to the floating village and very noisy making it difficult.We had a good time and met some very nice people so overall it was a good trip. I just think that there is some room for improvement, They are a bit forced in the way they script everything and you almost feel forced to smile or they think you're not enjoying yourself."

            "review": "Wonderful scenery and great food. We went on the 2 day 1 night cruise with Paloma. It is about a 4 hour drive to Ha Long Bay with a couple of touristy souvenir stops along the way but we were lucky enough to have the shuttle to ourselves on the way there. Once we finally got on the boat the facilities were good and the food was plentiful and excellent. The activities are fairly typical - visiting a floating village and the Sung Sot cave, but we did enjoy these. The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially David, and overall we enjoyed the trip, although it is a long way to go for less than 24 hours on the bay."

            "review": "Great cruise, long journey. My family recently did the two day/one night cruise aboard the Paloma. We managed to get a triple room for us and our 15 year old son which was great as not many companies offer this. This room is right up the front with it's own sun lounges and balcony so very nice. The rooms, food and staff were all excellent however we found it very regimented in terms of time for activities and not much leisure time. The road journey is about 4 hours each way.with obligatory stops at the usual tourist traps for snacks and souvenirs. My only other criticism is the fact that you leave very early for the return journey when you could probably have more time on the cruise. You then sit around at the holding area (on land) waiting for transport to return to Hanoi for over an hour which is quite boring as there is nothing to do there."

            "review": "Glad I did it but would not do it again. We did a two day/one night cruise on the Paloma starting in Hanoi. The bay itself is spectacular and is truly one of the natural wonders of the world so I am glad I was able to see it. The 2 days is hardly actually very short so if you have time it is best to do 2 nights and 3 days. In total you are only on the boat for about 22 hours and spend 8 hours driving in a cramped bus. The tour starts with a 4 hour drive in a fairly cramped mini van. The road is poor and they stop at a tourist trap style privately owned rest stop where there is a mind boggling array of handicrafts for sale at laughably high prices. They also stop along the way at pearl sales center where you can see how pearls are made and also gasp at the prices of the products for sale. You then arrive at the Paloma office and are efficiently boarded onto a tender then onto the ship itself. Once underway an excellent lunch is served as you cruise between the islands. In the afternoon you are able to kayak or take a small boat through floating village and also to swim in the bay. This is followed by a sunset party on the top deck and another wonderful meal. There are also various post dinner activities. In the morning you are served breakfast between 7 and 8 am and there is a tour to a nearby cave. The cave itself was large and interesting but the experience was entirely sullied by the number of other tourists packed into the area. I would not recommend this experience. Following the cave tour there is then a mad rush to get you out of your cabin and lunch is served at 10.30 so they can get ready for the next group of passengers. The ride back to Hanoi was cramped despite the fact two minivans came in that morning, they crammed all 10 of us into one van and also put a sick crew member in the front of the van. I would recommend you arrange your own transport to and from the boat. The bay is very well preserved but that means that boats can only moor in certain places so in the evening you are surrounded by a lot of other boats, giving the setting a slightly cramped feeling. All in all the Paloma staff were excellent and I am glad I got to see the bay. I would not repeat the experience again however."

            "review": "3 Day Trip A Must - Great value for money. We'd put Halong Bay on the Vietnam \"must do\" list for any traveller to this country.And if you are coming to Halong Bay - definitely consider the value for money 3 day Paloma Cruise (we booked through Darien Culbert who was excellent).We booked the \"honeymoon\" suite at the end of the boat with its own balcony as we had never been on a \"cruise\" and were worried whether we'd enjoy the experience.It delivered beyond our expectation (although we were not able to do the BBQ on the beach as the local 'inspector' for some reason would not permit our group to do so).The highlight was the middle day with the kayaking through the karats into hidden little bays away from all the other tourists.Food was plentiful and great. And we enjoyed the company of others on the boat more than we'd expected and randomly saw our shipmates in various other destinations as we toured the country - one of those crazy \"Closing Doors\" wonders of the world.Well worth investing in is the room with a verandah....lovely to have your own bit of outdoors and Paloma makes this affordable versus some of the much much more expensive trips.We paid $360 AUD per person and felt this was really great value for money."

            "review": "Lovely cruise. Booked through Halong Bay Legends who, despite my concern as there isn't much about them online, were excellent. The cruise was much more upper class than the cheaper one I have done previously. I really enjoyed getting dropped off in the Paloma cruise terminal - they have their own port so you aren't with all of the other tourists like on the cheap boats. The rooms are lovely with aircon and lovely showers. The food was excellent and there was so much of it. Unfortunately though the whole cruise felt really hurried and there was little time to actually enjoy the boat, and it isn't any different with 3 day cruises as you are on a day boat all of the 2nd day anyway. Staff were so pushy about everyone joining the activities but with only 2 loungers on the top deck there is nowhere to relax on the boat except for uncomfortable chairs on the top deck. I didn't like how the tour guide said we had to tip the wooden boat people at the fishing village - he recommended a high price of 100,000VND (hourly rate in Vietnam is a fraction of that for many people), Paloma should consider paying these people sufficiently so that guests aren't expected to fork out more money. A tour guide for another boat waiting behind us told his customers to choose the wooden boats because they are completely free but you have to pay for the kayaks?!"

We were surprised to realize that all drinks, not only alcoholic, were chargeable and not cheap. I suggest that you will buy drinks before you get on board. Other than that, cruise was great, food was fantastic and plentiful. Activities included squid fishing at night, cooking lesson, kayaking to a stunning floating fishing village and visiting an impressive cave. All activities were fun and there were many photo opportunities. .. to sum it up: very good - buy all your drinks before you go on board..."

            "review": "Stay for two nights!!. When planning our two week trip to Vietnam, I was told by several people to stay for two nights in Halong Bay!! I am SOOOO glad I took their advice. We used a tour agency who set our cruise up in Halong Bay so I did not do any research but Im sure happy with what they chose. Be prepared for a long drive from Hanoi on a bumpy road with other travelers in the van. There is no way around the long travel and roads but it will be worth it when you get there. That is why I suggest staying two nights as you will NOT want to take the long journey back the very next day! So while on the drive you will stop at a souvenir shop & restroom. DONT buy anything!! Its all OVER PRICED and you can get the same things in Hanoi!! Especially if you are interested in the silk, embroidered pictures! They are beautiful but we bought ours for HALF the price in Hanoi (SAME picture). Once you get to the bay, the process runs quickly and you will soon be welcomed aboard by a helpful & friendly staff. Once on board, they will explain the itinerary and times for everything. The manager & tour guides are great at making sure you know the plans. Lunch will be served while your bags go to your room. We had two rooms (one for my husband & I and one for our two children). The rooms were lovely and had everything you will need. Yes, they are small but the boat is not that big. You will hardly be in your room so that is not a concern. Our room had a balcony and it was quite roomy and nice to open the windows and doors to enjoy the morning views. I suggest you splurge for the balcony if you like to sit outside for a cigarette, glass of wine in the evening or coffee in the morning. IF you are unable to do that--no worries--the views from the sundeck are even more gorgeous. The boat is small so its no big deal to go up a few decks to the top. We were very surprised how cool the weather was!! If traveling there during one of their 4 seasons, then check the weather as we needed jackets! The weather was actually pleasurable but not completely sunny. But the guides said we actually got the better weather as the weeks and days before it was raining and overcast. So be mindful of the time of year you go and what the weather will be like. We traveled the last week in March and I believe it warms up in April. The activities are nice and you will have lots of opportunities to take great pictures and visit all around the bay. When you go to the floating, fishing village, I would choose to go on a rice boat and have a rower as this will enable you to just relax and take pictures and take in the sights at sunset. You can kayak if you choose but you will have another day to do that if you stay two nights. We also enjoyed the hike, kayaking, squid fishing, and the tour of the caves. You will be active which my kids love but when staying the 2 1/2 days, you will have time to relax too!! Its a perfect mix! The food is very good and they try so hard to make it beautiful and the staff is wonderful. We always had too much food and sometimes the repeat of the same things but we were all satisfied. Two of us do not eat seafood so they were always accommodating. They do have a sundeck party in the evenings but it was never a \"party\" but I think that just depends on the group and mix of people you have. Also the weather was a bit chilly up top. They offer free Sangria and that was really good. Prices for drinks were very reasonable. We did try the \"spa services\". This was the only thing I was disappointed about. The room is just a cabin and its not set up to have any spa ambiance like music, low lighting, candles, etc. I could totally overlook that if the services were better. Do NOT get the facial. Its not a facial!! Just rubbing lotion & oil on your face over and over. And the products are just cheap over the counter stuff (like Ponds). I did get a massage and that was better but you could wait and get those things done better & cheaper in the city. Overall--Halong Bay is a must do and we were extremely pleased with this cruise line!! So if you are researching then search no more and book the 2 1/2 day package and you wont regret it--otherwise after one night you will be telling yourself, \"I wish we would have stayed longer!\""

They answered all questions before we got there promptly, clearly and honestly and all our arrangements worked out perfectly. The actual experience once they picked us up was excellent. It was first class all the way. They take very good care of you. We enjoyed our guide and the scheduled activities. The boat itself was lovely, clean and elegant. The meals were several courses and quite good, although at times I did wish they did not take so long. Our daughter left her wallet in her room and when we called later that day from the Haiphong airport they got right on it. Before we left our next destination, Hoi An, we received it via special mail service. A huge thank-you for making sure that happened. Big kudos"

            "review": "Had a great time. There seem to be 100's of tours cruising halong bay of various different qualities and themes and it's hard to choose but I doubt anyone would be disappointed with this one. It was a very mixed group on our cruise of families and older and younger couples. As part of a younger couple I felt like they probably got a good balance of things to do so you didn't feel like it was all weighted towards any particular group. Also they seemed to time excursions well when what we were seeing was fairly quiet. I loved the kayaking and open water swimming most but everything was good. It's a full schedule but you don't feel bossed or shepherded about just entertained. There is LOADS of food given to you during the cruise all included in the price and all delicious. There's a bar on the boat and a nice terrace. Drinks are reasonably priced (and strong!)Tour guide seemed a lovely guy and very knowledgable. Cabin was comfy and it was just really cool to spend the night on it in the bay definitely worth doing.When your considering what cruise to take I think if your going from hanoi like us something that really makes this company worth picking is the transport you go in. It's a long (4 hour) drive to halong bay on a very undeveloped bumpy road. These guys take you in new comfy minibus with air con. We saw lots of other much less appealing buses heading the same way which would have been a lot less fun and at least two broken down at the side of the road which would ruin your trip! For what you get this was not expensive."

            "review": "Great Choice. I really struggled with which boat cruise to go on in Halong Bay. I also struggled with the decision if it was worth the 4 hour drive each way. I can say that it was definitely worth the drive and I was really happy I went. I was also happy that I chose Paloma. (After days of research I had narrowed it down to Bhaya and Paloma). Our guide and the crew were amazing. Very helpful and provided top-notch service. The food was really good, the boat was clean and well maintained. We (I was traveling with a friend) enjoyed all of the activities (kayaking, floating village, pearl farm, spring roll making, squid fishing, tai chi, suprising cave, etc..). We also lucked out with a great group of passengers on the boat. If I had to come up with something to complain about, it would be that the beds are quite hard. Otherwise, everything else was great. I highly recommend the Paloma, after angonizing over the decision, I was really happy with my choice."
