            "review": "Perfect escape from the hectic souks. The souks are an amazing experience but after a few hours can leave you feeling tired and stressed. Le Jardin Secret is the perfect escape from all this. The entry is 50 Dirhams which is a reasonable price to pay for a quiet moment of reflection. The garden consists of an Islamic style garden and an exotic garden, both of which feature fountains fed by an ingenious system of water pipes all the way from the Atlas Mountains. There are two cheap cafes where you can enjoy some Moroccan tea and free biscuits for 15 dirhams, with only the sound of trickling water to disturb you. The garden is quite difficult to find, be wary of people offering to \"guide\" you there. Do not give them change until they take you right to the door, and do not feel obliged to pay them at all. Your best bet is to ask for directions to cafe Arabe, the garden is opposite this well known restaurant."

The gardens are beautiful and tranquil, with a variety of interesting plants and a few features from the original irrigation system. There's a video on a loop that explains how the place was built.

There are places to sit, a place for a light lunch or a a drink, information about the planting and the restoration, and a tower which offers fabulous views of Marrakech. We were lucky to meet the man behind the project and his enthusiasm for this garden shows in his attention to detail throughout - plants are named, steps are provided for a better view. Do pay to see the tower, the guides are very well informed and bring the history to life. Do go."

We spent 2-3 hours relaxing in the garden, looking at the wonderfully refurbished water system as well the the amazing plants. They have one of the city's highest towers - the views are unparalleled. There is a cafe overlooking the gardens and if you keep your entry receipt they may allow you back in on another day without having to pay again.Before too long this could be one of Marrakesh's top 10 destinations - see it soon!"

I was walking along the medina and stumbled across this place by accident. it was just what we needed its a calm oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the medina. We felt at peace straight away the staff explained what the garden had to offer before we paid the entrance fee (50 dirham adult children free) well worth it. It was the most beautiful garden i have been to and i have been to all the gardens in marrakech and many around the world. We just didn't want to leave. They have pomegranate trees,fig tree,date trees and grape trees its just unbelievable. The staff couldn't do more for us from mohammed the waiter to the chef who made the best coconut tart i have ever tasted. Their mint tea was also the best we have tasted. Its the overall ambience we feel that makes this the best place we have visited in marrakech."

Although the entrance is expensive we fully appreciated the work done to restaur these garden. I would highly recommend it. The level of Authenticity is to perfection. It s so peaceful there and the guides are super nice. Lunch was wonderful (had a salad) in this beautiful surrounding. A must for plants lovers and people interested in renovation...it took 3 years of hard labour for this to happen."

It's an amazing place, so quiet and peaceful, very different from the old town outside. The loudest sounds are of water and birdsong. We were taken round by one of the attendants, who was obviously very proud of the place. From the terrace overlooking the garden you get a great view of the whole site. It's wonderful that only a few years ago, there was nothing here, and the short film of how the garden was conceived and built, is well worth watching. A lovely place in an interesting city."

On the day we had spent in the Medina my boyfriend found our way to the garden (which wasnt easy) but once you are on the correct street it is easy to find. And yes once inside it is very calming and tranquil with lovely seating areas and a small cafe (we didnt use this) the wifi was great and the lovely toilets a delight lol The gardens themselves are not amazing and I would not make a journey here specifically to visit the garden but if you are in the Medina and souks and need a break from the frenzy then for the price you pay it is worth it for the calm , the wifi , cafe and toilets. It really is nice that they have been renovated , so if you are in the Medina and find the garden do go in."

Once again, his knowledge was very extensive, and he was more than happy to answer our questions & take plenty of pictures of us. Again, he really seemed to enjoy his job and it showed.The gardens themselves are a delight to see. The restoration has been very thoroughly done, with plenty of information boards around, showing the progress from ruin to beautifully presented gardens. It's a fascinating place, ideal for whiling away an hour or two, and all for around \u00a35 per person."

We'd been told this was a great place to visit, but really weren't prepared for just how great it actually was! The gardens themselves are outstanding - beautifully designed and maintained - photos really don't do it justice. You really need to see it for yourself.The staff were incredible too, extremely helpful and knowledgable. We chose to buy tickets to go up the tower as well, and were not at all expecting the personal tour we got, which was wonderfully informative. Our tour guide Jawad was amazing, he knew everything about the place and explained it to us in a really engaging way. He was also kind enough to show us the panoramic view from the top of the tower and point out all the important landmarks, looking out over Marrakech. Lastly, the cafe provided us with delicious beverages and the waiter who served us was absolutely lovely. We will 100% be returning!"

A mesmerizing oasis to get away from all the hustle and turbulence of the Medina.Le Jardin Secret is divided into two different gardens. The area was built back in the early 16th century in the Saadian dynasty but was deserted for a long time, falling in a state of disrepair. An Italian architect restored the ancient structures of the building lately and re-opened this beautiful garden in 2016.You can now visit an exotic garden an the islamic garden, both served by the original ancient water system which served the whole Medina with the water from the Atlas mountains once. I was amazed by the craftily system which was explained to me by a very friendly, heartily guide.You should also visit the tower at the corner of the garden. It is higher than the rest of the buildings in the Medina, offering a stunning view over the whole city and beyond to the Atlas mountains."

Gawad met us in the garden, and was incredibly informative and entertaining about everything within the garden, then we went up the tower and he was brilliant about everything we could see from the tower. We ducked in to get something to drink and to get out of the markets for a bit, we were also hesitant to pay the charge to get in, but after being in there, totally worth it.I would recommend as a visit either early into your visit, as the view is the best I saw of the city and surrounding mountains, to plan where you would be interested in, or towards the end, should you become weary of the pace of marrakech and want some quiet space. Ate here too, food was good, the cocktails (non alcoholic, naturally) were amazing. The iced tea was perfect for the heat, could drink that all day."

I predict that in time, this garden will be more popular than the lovely Jardin Majorelle. What fascinated me the most in this garden was the lengths the restoration crews went to to keep all the construction methods authentic and hand made when it would have been so simple (and a tragedy!) to utilize new methods.When you are tired of the markets and the souks, catch your breath and relax here.You will be happy that you did."

For more than 70 years, this ancient Riad and garden was left to rack and ruin but since 2008, the garden and it's architecture have been renovated and rejuvenated back to their former glory. For the first time in over 400 years, the Riad has opened its doors to the public. The Riad was home to some of Morocco's rich and most influential people. There is a pavilion and tower with a terrace that you can look over the garden and city of Marrakech. There are two gardens irrigated with water from the Atlas Mountains. The first garden is an exotic garden filled with plants and trees from the five continents, bursting with the scent of lavender. The other is an Islamic garden. All Islamic gardens are based on Heaven and have an Olive, Fig, Date and Pomegranate tree with a a fountain of water in the middle to represent life.There is a cafe where you can sit in shaded the garden and enjoy the tranquility of this secret haven with lunch of panini, french fries with delicious homemade coleslaw, homemade dessert and a cool drink of fresh juice, bottled water or mint tea, whichever takes your fancy. It also has free wi-fi but you'll have to get the code from a member of staff.The Riad and garden has an interesting story to tell, there is a video to watch on how the project was cleverly but painstaking put together and there are guides to tell the history of this most beautiful discovery with information on its plants and the 1000 year old water system that still irrigates the gardens today.We were also privileged to meet the owner who kindly gave his time to tell us how he came to acquiring and renovating the buildings and garden.Entrance fee is 40 MAD so it if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the souks and experience something serene and special for an hour or two in the heart of the medina, then Le Jardin Secret is the perfect place."

They are so peaceful, it is hard to believe the hustle and bustle of the souks is only a few metres away! It is definitely paying the extra to go to the top of the tower to view the city and whiling away a few hours of lunch was wonderful."

There were hardly any visitors when we were there which made it even more peaceful. There's a video of the renovations which has some interesting information on the traditional Morrocan building techniques and garden structure. It was 40 dh so pricier than some of the bigger more established places but worth a stop while meandering through the Souks. There's also free WiFi throughout the garden."

Le Jardin Secret is just\u00a0opposite.After a hot non-stop \"tour\" through the souks of Marrakech, trailing behind an uncommunicative local guide, we were in the mood for a cooler change. We'd seen Medinas before. Something different, please!\u00a0First up next morning was the Jardin Marjorelle. Easy to find: shaded; stylish; busy.But the highlight was yet to come \u00a0- Le Jardin Secret/The Secret Garden.\u00a0What a place - a lovingly restored Riad with 2 beautiful gardens. The interior richness hidden from the outside gaze.\u00a0Here you are a welcome guest - ushered in, shown the delights of the place by Mohammed and Jawad who clearly delight in it also. The video is excellent and you get a real appreciation of how much care and loving attention to detail has gone into this faithful reconstruction by its Italian owner who has clearly made this a labour of love. It's a place of beauty.\u00a0Already relaxed, we sat in the shade beside running water, admiring the Islamic garden whilst mint tea and tasty panini were served by Mohammed our waiter. The people here have been hand-picked. We felt quite special, really.We weren't going to shop, but they have great stuff! Hand made locally - some of it by the artist who works there, some by a women's cooperative.\u00a0Summary: hospitality, beauty, history and style. Leave the souk behind."

We had the whole garden to ourselves for about an hour which we are sure will become a rarity. The research, love and care that has gone into the project is evident.

I cannot begin to describe the peace as soon as you enter, the guides fitted about are unobtrusive and informative- of particular interest is the way they have used and old watering system bringing water from the Atlas Mountains. We were lucky enough to meet the modest owner whose idea it was to transform the space back to gardens rather than possibly a more profitable Risd. He was undoubtedly proud of the work that had taken place here.Well worth a visit right in the heart of a busy bustling city."

I wish we had longer to spend in this small garden but didn't realise the video about the construction was 20+ minutes and had to rush back to the bus to our hotel. The gardens themselves, one Islamic and one exotic, are beautiful. We didn't pay extra to go up the tower but you could really appreciate the beauty from the balcony. The cafe also looked lovely and the tour guides there were very informative, telling us all about how the water travels to different parts of the garden. We only paid 40 dirhams each as they were still working on the garden as it had not been open long."

I found the history and restoration so facinating. You must watch the video, which is located in a small view room 1/2 way through the garden - it really makes you appreciate the garden so much more. Also, read about how water is distributed through out the garden - it is so interesting!"

The palace has been rebuilt and the gardens restored by a design team lead by an Italian architect. The property has an ancient ceramic aqua-duct fed by the Atlas Mountains and has been beautifully restored to its original glamour. The 2 tour guides that showed me different sections of the site (included in the entry fee) were informative, lovely and very welcoming. They both spoke beautiful english. The information provided is also in Moroccan Arabic, French and English so I was able to get a lot of detail about the history. The islamic garden and the exotic garden were both beautiful, and have inspired me to do more in my own garden at home in Australia on return. A fantastic little site in the heart of the Medina."

The last minute we decided to visit and it was a good choice.We start with a quick cafe on the terassa. The service was so welcoming.Then we visit the chamber where there is a 23 min. Movie in French or English , that tells you all you need on this place and it renovation.Then we hang around the two gardens listening to the water, fallowing the irrigation system. One Islamic gardenAnd one exotic.We finished at the unique tower that is a perfect spot to see the Medina, since these days it is not allow to built higher then8 miter at the Center and here we could climb 17 meter to view.Going down we stopped at the cafe againThis time for fresh cut fruit salad and tortia with fresh veg salad.It is little higher price then the normal price of heart Marracech, but you can feel the western touch taking care of the local treasures"

Stumbled by the Gardens as we walked past and realized they just opened last month. 20% off entrance fees of 50dhs for the gardens - additional 30dhs for the tower. Staff were wonderful - they approached to give a background of the place. The view from atop the tower was beautiful - the Atlas Mountains would be beautiful if the sky was clear. Sitting by the pool for a cuppa was relaxing - the coffee one of the better ones here."

All beautifully done. 3 comments, 1. Staff were all very helpful and informative, 2. There were several excellent descriptions of the plants and irrigation, 3 Well worth seeing the 20 minute film about the restauration"

Had a basic but freshly cooked snack in the courtyard under umbrellas. It is worth paying extra for going to the top of the tower. Interesting and a different addition to the history of the area. The gardens are new so I would say in a couple of years they will start to show their true beauty more but the Islamic design is true to its origins. Worth a visit."

The Secret Garden can be found in the Mouassine district of the souk, just opposite the restaurant Cafe Arabe.You initially enter through the Exotic garden, which is filled with plants from around the world. This garden has a contemporary feel, with the eye being drawn through by an Islamic inspired water rill.The second \u201cIslamic\u201d garden was restored, following what would have been the original 18th century layout. Water is at the heart of each garden, and increases the sense of tranquillity and as a place of contemplation.A tower found in the far right corner of the Islamic garden can be entered for an extra fee, currently 30 DH. This does seem rather expensive, considering that the fee to enter the garden itself is 40 DH. However, from its roof terrace, you can enjoy good views over Marrakech, as well as a \u201cbirds eye view\u201d of the garden itself.Should you wish to linger a while longer, two cafes are found within the Islamic garden serving light lunches and afternoon teas."

You can climb up the tower for a small fee where you get an excellent view of the walled city. The planting is spectacular and even the tiled floor was a gem. Also the loveliest toilets in Marrakech!!"

It was a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle and a definite must for any visitors."

Most of it had been restored from some delapidated ruins, some built from the ground up, and successfully combined old and new with great panache and style. The whole thing, designed by an Italian architect with a British garden designer and using a host of Moroccan craftspeople and builders, showcases the artistry and allegory of Islam. The incredibly knowledgeable and passionate guides tell a fascinating story of history, construction and spirituality which make for a must-see experience. Brilliant."

So this is essentially 2 formal walled gardens, one tropical with a range of flowers and plants, the other is an islamic garden with central water feature. Staff at this setting could not be more helpful. We paid extra fee and went up to the tower which was okay and a chance to look across the rooftops of Marrakech. The guide provide information about the construction of the current site as well as the history. A video is also playing on loop to tell the story of the very recent renovations to create the gardens. Even with 20 discount, price was a bit steep in our view. All very pretty and tidy but other attractions in area such as the Tombs or Palace Gardens you pay a lower fee."

We noticed the work going on behind a high wall opposite Cafe Arab when we were here last year. The garden is a real delight with a definite twist - not one but two gardens. We visited the week the gardens opened and were enchanted. You walk off the busy streets of the medina into an oasis of calm. A traditional riad or garden has been restored with a very understated cool vibe. A nice contrast to the lush Majorelle Gardens and the more traditional gardens in the Bahia Palace. Very helpful staff and we also got a wee history of the renovation from the Italian architect. Not to be missed !"
