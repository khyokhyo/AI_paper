Beautiful gardens to walk around in and a park area for kids. Loved the bio-diversity garden filled with quirky little objects to interest both kids and adults alike. Very peaceful and relaxing to walk around. Views of Table Mountain also amazing."

Think of a London Park, add beautiful weather & a stunning view of mountains, sky & paragliders,many different plants & waterways and remember you are in a City. Green Point Park is also a great shortcut from a buzzy Cape Quarter to a lazy beach stroll at Mouille Point.. Just go & enjoy.. Fitness folk go get jogging or cycling.. fun for the whole family."

Stroll the biodiversity gardens, learn about the Khoi-Khoi--the first inhabitants of the Cape, take in the colour and diversity of our amazing fynbos plant kingdom. It's free, relaxing and easy to get to. Do yourself a favour and walk from town on the fan walk or from the Waterfront via the promenade to Green Point Lighthouse."

I went there early on a Friday morning, and just about had the park to myself, except for the odd maintenance person or gardener (who were all very friendly and greeted me) and a few lone joggers coming from the lighthouse side. It makes for a lovely tranquil stroll in the heart of the city, with a number of special interest areas on local medicinal plants, a bead sculpture garden, play area for kids, and my favourite, the labyrinth. I didn't even know there was one here, so it was a lovely addition to an already pleasant experience. Take the time to stroll and enjoy the lovely setting and then go to one of the coffee shops along the beachfront for a coffee. Bliss."

The walk along the golf course over the wooden bridge towards the lighthouse is stunning. Then veer off into the actual bio diversity area which is well marked for those interested in reading up a bit. Lots of sculptures and interesting nooks and crannies. Beautiful way to while away some time on a sunny day"

            "review": "This is a GREAT new park in Cape Town. BUT Cape Town, unlike many other cities, does not have many parks. If you want a park something like you may have visited in other cities, rather go to the Company Gardens. Back to Green Point Park. A few years ago this was a windblown (look at some of the older trees - even though old, they are small and grow at funny angles in the wind) patch of land that was upgraded to a park as part, i think, of the 2010 World Cup soccer stadium. Anyway, unlike the stadium, this park was one of the good byproducts of the 2010 world cup. Bear in mind that this park is still young, so few big trees but in time it will be pretty good. Wander around the park and see all that there is to see; there are pond areas, areas where particlar plants are being developed, play areas. last time i was there the restaurant/snack food building was empty but I hear it is now occupied. I am not sure what it is like but there are wonderful alternatives on the sea (north) side of the park. Go through the gate and the sea will be about 200 to 300 metres away. There are several really great spots for breakfast/lunch/brunch/coffee. I can only recommend these spots for breakfast/lunch as I have never been to any of them for dinner."

Or as an adult, you can run or ride your bike around the park. When I was there, they were busy with a coffee shop. That would be lovely to just go sit there, in the fresh air and have a drink and relax."

Very impressed with how everything in this place was thought through: clean and beautiful spot, well looked after plants and ponds with birds, plenty of space both in the shade and in the sun for a picnic, drinking water for humans and their dogs (I saw a few cats on a leash too), paths to walk and roads to ride a bicycle. You will feel there comfortable by yourself, with your friends or family, with children and dogs or without. There is a lot of parking around and the entrance is free."

Not just did they create a space where individuals, couples and families can all enjoy the amenities, but they made sure that your stroll through the grounds will be informative and relaxing. There are ponds with birds, gardens with fynbos and medicinal plants, wire and steel animals and insects, paw prints of wild animals, the stages of building a hut, jungle gyms for different age groups, picnic areas, amphi theatre, serenity circle, beautiful pristine lawns, a water wheel. The lake that separates the park from the golf course next door tells the story of yacht races in years gone by. There is a function venue as well. The park has opening and closing times. The park is kept in pristine condition by a dedicated team of cleaners and guards are on duty at the gates. Do not leave the area without a stroll through this beautiful piece of nature."

The Green Point Park and Biodiversity Garden was developed on 12.5 hectares between Signal Hill and the Atlantic Ocean and it owned by the City of Cape Town. It allows Capetonians to explore, be active and learn about biodiversity. There are entrances to the park from nearly all sides and provides a great outing for both children and alike and it is common to find family picnics or birthday's parties and other parties being celebrated their.The Park is well utilised but weekends naturally it is much more busier. Entry is free and that helps make it a great attraction. Even with huge numbers, noise is minimal and there is a great sense of tranquillity, perhaps aided by the gentle flowing waterway or the birds and small animal life in the area. The biodiversity garden features over 20 000+ indigenous plants and there is a wide variety of flora, water features and wetlands.Ample benches and seating can be found, but come early. The park has wide paved paths for walkers, skateboarding, those pushing prams or wheelchairs and children on bikes to navigate safely around each other. The toilet facilities are always kept clean and there are friendly guards advising visitors on what to not do. The park area has a section for kids 1-6 (Tot a Lot) and for children aged 7 -18, there is an Adventure Play Park and for those wanting to have a work-out, the Green Gym circuit.A definite place to enjoy whenever one can."

One looks at them and immediately one already feels healthy. The view is beautiful because when one looks out there are low-lying clouds that are sort of purplish. The waves are Loud and crashing and the water is so cold - it is not possible to play inside the sea. However there are so many different playgrounds through the entire beach - it is actually a long seafront promenade - One can just take your pick. It is so much fun for the children. A little while further down, there is a swimming pool filled with sea water but the queue was just too long even at 8.30am!\u00a0"

And I associate it with screaming kids -- not relaxing at all.But this evening I happened to walk through it with my dog en route from Mouille Point to the Green Point Cricket Club and I was blown away by the spectacular views of Signal Hill and the mountain, and by the lush indigenous vegetation. And it is spotlessly clean.It was pretty empty save for a couple of women runners. In fact, everyone I passed was a woman! I assume this means it is a safe place to walk alone particularly as it was 6pm.I was walking in the optimal direction to see the view: from the beachfront towards the city, so I had the mountain in my sights all the time. And when I got to the East Gate (I presume that is what the gate is called -- I entered via the West Gate), the fields were full of boot campers and athletes. And a security guard was sitting in the entrance hut. The sign states it closes at sunset.I often wondered why this park was on the tourist list. But now I can clearly see why."

            "review": "Who's in charge???. Firstly, thanks for reading this. My issues are coming on since 2012 and I've finally gotten around to saying something about it.I contacted the city of cape town (they are still the contact entity for the park) just before I got married in 2012 to ask permission to use the park for photos, as security at the park indicated that permission was required. I was told that I did not need permission as it was a public park and it was free to use for the photos. I still have the email chain where security and park maintenance was informed. On the day, 21 April 2012, after the wedding ceremony, we went to the park to start the photo session. Soon after we started, we were approached by security informing us that we are not allowed to take photos there. I said to the security that we were given the all clear as it was a public park. The security officer maintained that written permission, in the form of a permit, was required. She then said she would call her supervisor to corroborate her information. When the supervisor arrived, she too indicated that we need permits, as we were in the bio garden and that was the requirement. I said to her that the City had indicated that the park was open to use. She also then said that the City had no jurisdiction there and should not be making such decisions or offering such information. I was then told that I could take photos on the grass, but not in the garden. Needless to say I was not at all happy. They even threatened to remove my wife and I from the park! I just left the park in disgust.Then earlier this year (2015), I was planning a picnic in the park to celebrate my daughter's first birthday. In preparation, my wife contacted the city of cape town (Patricia Giliomee) telephonically to ask about regulations regarding groups of people meeting in the park and rules regarding picnics etc. Because it was in January, we knew we would need to cater for shelter from the sun, so she also asked whether a gazebo could be setup for shade. The feedback was that we could use the park, no special permission was required, and regarding the gazebo, the only rule is that we could not pierce the ground as we may damage the irrigation system. That suited us fine as we could tie it to cooler bags or poles in the immediate area. On the day, we got there, setup in the play area far from the bio garden, then were approached by security who told us that gazebos were not allowed. We said to the security officer that we were told that gazebos were allowed. She then said she would get her supervisor. When the supervisor arrived (same lady as in the previous incident), she reiterated that gazebos were not allowed and that signage at the various gates indicated as such. When we said that we'd spoken to Patricia Giliomee who indicated that all was in order, the security supervisor didn't know who that lady was! She (again) indicated that the city has no jurisdiction there and should not be making such decisions or offering such information, and should we not take down the gazebo, we would be removed. Again, I was not a happy camper. I decided to just forget about it, took down the gazebo, and tried to have a good time.The only reason I am writing this is because it seems that everyone else has had fantastic experiences. People need to know that no-one seems to know who's in charge. As beautiful, well-kept and kid-friendly the park is, I will think twice before planning anything there."

It had a great atmosphere ,then walking around the ponds and gardens it was very tranquil. We nearly fell over a goose resting on a bridge. It was jut a lovely place to go on a sunny Sunday.

There was one 3 years ago but evidently when they applied for planning permission it was turned down on the grounds that the zone is recreational. Very short sighted Cape Town City planners, the building is already there so you might as well put it to good use. Everyone needs a drink or an ice cream when at the park!"

The walkways were so easily taken while the new beds and gardens were beautifully finished for visitors to enjoy both flora and fauna. The waterareas were well contained and not a danger for young children. A very refreshing venue for a family outing, with no possibility of crime. It can be easily found beside the new rugby stadium at Greenpoint."

During my visit to Cape Town, I stayed in Green Point off of Main Rd and walked almost daily over to the lighthouse and the promenade, stopping along the way to bird watch and stroll the garden, which really is informative and has fun statues. The park really is great for joggers and those seeking a quiet spot to read along the little lake facing the golf course, plus there are areas for the kids to play or to have picnics with Lion's Head and ocean views. Special events are also held on the grounds, such as the opening of the annual Diwali festival, which started the second day I was in town.Bonus for Geocachers: There's a cache hidden in Biodiversity Garden. Check it out!"

This is probably the best option for a park to play in for kids in Cape Town - there aren't too many alternatives (maybe we are spoilt by having half a dozen within walking distance).I took my under 6 kids to play in the dedicated play area. There was a reasonable selection of equipment, but it was very crowded (I guess lack of supply), and I didn't think the ground was overly forgiving for falls off some equipment that is quite high for toddlers.Also, there was no-one stopping older kids from using the facilities either.If you're in Cape Town and your kids need to have a run out, this is one of the better options. Compared to others across the world, it's average.Admittedly, we didn't use any of the other facilities. Also, it's worth noting that parking was accessible."

There are several children's playgrounds, all age related, which is so good for little ones who might otherwise be overwhelmed by older children. It is wonderful to watch children enjoying parties and educational programmes at the outdoor amphitheatre. There is also an outdoor gym, labyrinth and many areas to explore, including a biodiversity garden with lovely walks and interesting facts, indigenous plants and many trees. The park is spotlessly clean and well maintained and there are lovely areas to sit beside the lake or beneath the trees and enjoy the incredibly peaceful setting. Signal Hill and Cape Town Stadium form imposing backdrops. It would be nice to have a place to sit and enjoy a coffee but there are so many great coffee shops and restaurants around Green Point, Mouille Point and The Waterfront, nearby. So wonderful, I wish this park had been done years ago."

Well it is terrific with open greenspace but so much more for here is an interesting park design supplemented with innovative interpretative programmes, some whimsical and fun, some with serious intent but expressed in a clear and easily understood way. This is urban park design at its best with native plants used extensively. Everybody will find something to please them at Greenpoint but those wishing to understand the issues of managing and conserving Cape Town's flora will be most satisfied."

Easy to pop over for a nice take-away latte or a lunch.We've had picnics here and taken the kids bikes along as it's a nice big safe space for them to ride or run around. They also loved the indigenous gardens with explanations about the traditional uses of plants and kept asking questions.

It has a lovely picnic area where countless birthday parties are held on a daily basis. Of course the area is limited so most people come early in order to \"book\" their space. The more senior citizens also enjoy the large ares where you can walk in a safe environment as the whole area is closely monitored by helpful staff both security and other.The only drawback of the whole area is the lack of an eatery of some sort- an inexpensive coffee shop type of establishment is just what this place needs! Perhaps the City Fathers should look at the viability of this.All in all, just the place to unwind, practice your yoga or tai-chi or just relax!"

A running race was in progress so decided to see the finish, which, it so happened, was through this park to the outside of the magnificent stadium.I walked and ran through the park and was amazed at the fish pools, water wheel, explanations of the area at all points of interest. This coupled with the views, and places to picnic, with facilities for children, so near the built up area, is a find that must be seen to be appreciated."

I visited the gardens on Sunday, the weather was stunning, since my last visit about eight months ago the plants have grown and birds have made their homes in the trees, and we saw butterflies and bees. I took my elderly parents, they couldnt stop raving, there were plenty of seats for them to sit on and watch the children in the play area. Families were having their lunch at the wooden tables next to the water, others were relaxing on the beautiful lawns. The toilets were clean, there was plenty of security and we found parking in the parking area next to the Virgin Active Gym. The backdrop of Table Mountain, and signal hill just add to the beauty. We would have liked a cup of tea and cake, but there wasnt anything in the garden so take your own flask or walk to the main roads to get something to eat."

The park is safe- with seperate play areas for children under 4.This is especially great- because the equipment isnt so high and is easier for the younger children to interact with on their own.There is also a section of the park with adult exercise equipment- so you can easily get a quick work out whilst your children play.Lots of young families are in the park in the early evening and there is a lovely community atmosphere."

For the more fitness-focused the park is ideal for joggers and even has outdoor gym equipment. It's proximity to the city makes it ideal to piggyback it with other attractions nearby. Free access is another major plus."

Lovely outdoor venue for a picnic, a walk, or a trip out with the little ones to let off some energy.Beautiful jungle gyms for the little ones and even outdoor exercise equipment for mom and dad or solo/group adult visitors.The garden is also lovely to explore, though the park can get busy and very noisy on good weather days. Late evenings from about an hour prior to closing time seems to suit me best, as it's pretty quiet then.All in all, definitely worth visiting if you're in or around Cape Town CBD, especially with little ones."

This place makes me so proud to be a Capetonian! Another locals haunt, Newport Cafe, is a stones throw away on Beach Road and great for either making up your own picnic from their deli or slipping into a near-coma over cake and coffee."

The views from the gardens include Table Mountain and you are at the footstep of the World Cup Stadium - it is a great spot for taking pictures. Parking is fairly easy - head along the beach road in Moulle Point and park and walk through. It is great to combine a walk with a visit to one of the little restaurants in the area - so plan on a coffee and Cafe Neo afterwards next to the lighthouse or head to Newport Deli to stock up with great breads, cheeses and meats and then head into the gardens for a picnic! It is a wonderful area for relaxation and a great addition to the city"
