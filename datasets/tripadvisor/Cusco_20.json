The garden is also lovely with lots of spring flowers out in October. From the choir loft you can look down into the church, where on my visit a choir was singing (in Quechua, I think).

Arrived around 1 pm on a Saturday and had a good hour before the hoards arrived. The Convent was built on the site of the Inka Templo del Sol, a sacred site. I found it interesting to see the mix of Spanish Colonial architecture and the remains of the Inka site blended together. Much of the Cathedral was damaged in the 1950 earthquake, revealing Inka walls that are now being restored to some degree.I enjoyed wandering in the gardens after exploring indoors, and examining some of the Inka structure up close.In my opinion, an English-speaking guide wasn't necessary. There is English signage."

I live in Europe and get \"cathedraled out\" very quickly, so I decided to narrow my religious tourist activities down to this place and one other. It was super interesting to see how the Inca walls had been used as a part of the Catholic complex and to imagine how the place must've looked when the Inca sections were covered in silver and gold. The upstairs section had an exhibition of contemporary local art that I really enjoyed, and the gardens were a really nice place to sit, relax and read. There will be tour guides outside telling you that there is no signage in English and offering tours for around 40-80 soles. Based on reviews here, I took up one of these offers after a small group formed and I could reduce the price to 20 soles for myself. Our particular guide was very knowledgeable but rushed us through the complex and probably told us less than we could've learned by reading a guidebook before going in. Also, there was a lot of signage in English, so I'm not sure a guide is completely necessary. Just so you know."

Around 1:30 p.m., the Convento had a rush of at least four very large group tours so it is a good idea to arrive around lunch time. I loved the art. Our guide showed us the signficance of the Arch Angels wings which were similar in shape to a Condor's wings. Impressive!!!"

I thought she didn't know what she was talking about, so I went inside to ask the guard and he told us the Boleto Turistico only covers a tiny museum, and not the Temple of the Sun, which is the main attraction of the site. I was about to pay, when I was a sign that you are not even allowed to take pictures of the temple. That was enough for me to turn around. What a rip off! The church itself is beautiful, but IDK why they include the site on the Boleto if it does not even get you access to the temple. Save yourself 15 soles and just enjoy it from the outside."

The history between how the Spanish built on top of the famous Incan 'lego-piece' foundations is fascinating, especially how during earthquakes the colonial structures would fall but the Incan structures would stay. It's a beautiful church as well, and is an important temple in Incan history."

We very much wanted to visit this site but it's a bit strange seeing the remains of the Inca temple surrounded by the triumphant Catholic religious buildings--which were destroyed twice by earthquakes (1659 and 1950) while the better engineered and constructed Inca walls remained. It's worth visiting for the sake of surviving and preserved Inca walls and rooms. Don't miss the impressive view from below. A guide really helps, as many important features of the site are unmarked."

We stopped in as we were staying across the street and had read good things about this place.Entry was 15 sols per person and we opted to go without a guide. The convent is one built around an old Incan temple and it was quite beautiful. The melding of the architecture was lovely and it's one of the few places we've ever seen where two types are so well maintained The courtyard outside has a number of large paintings and was nice to walk around in. Overall however we found the art pieces the most impressive. There were a number of rooms dedicated to them with plenty of good explanations of the pictures. Many were huge and dated back 300-400 years. The funniest thing we learned was that some of the painters put a portrait on their creations after finishing them. It was like a terrible game of Where's Waldo!Make sure to go upstairs and see the balcony of the church as well. The main area up there is amazing and the ancillary rooms have some additional impressive paintings and furniture.An amazing church/museum to walk through and do some learnin' in!"

You can walk around the rest of Cuzco and grab a good idea of the city and what it might looked like 500 years ago, before the Spanish destroyed everything that the Inca Empire built. But the Convento de Santo Domingo, built on top of Qoricancha, deserves a guided tour. So you can understand the immensity of the Inca and how far did the Spanish go to break their mind. If you get a good guide, he will explain you how this old construction is related with the rest of the ruins around the city and how Qoricancha was the center of power in old Cuzco. It's an essential part of your visit to the city."

You can hire a guide at the entrance, which is probably worth it if you are not accompanied by a local friend, as you will want to understand the historical background, to help appreciate the beauty of the place. A must if you are in Cusco and should perhaps be done before heading to Machu Picchu. Visit is about 1hour but you can decide to stay longer: visitors have access to the beautiful garden which is a great place to relax with a book on a sunny day."

What I love most about this ancient building is its grounds. They are filled with beautiful flowers and a vibrant green lawn. The building itself is a great example of how ancient Incan and Spanish and colonial art hybridize into the modern Peruvian landscape. The exhibits inside are a little less interesting; they more or less say \"all of this used to be covered in gold before the Spanish stole it all. It used to look great... but now it doesn't....\" It is worth a pass through, but not super thoroughly. A tour guide may not be necessary since most of the plaques have an English side as well."

It has lots of original inca and christian architectures within and outside of the structure. Touch the original stones and fee the passage of time Lots of arts and artifacts housed in thereEntry fee was cheap enough.I do recommend going with a spanish speaking friend so u dont get tempted to hire and translator/guide althought they seem quite goodVery impressive place that u can get lost in and submerge urself in the magic of their history"

I couldn't see the limited Incan ruins that remained through the the hoards of elderly asian tour groups playing with their selfie sticks. It felt claustrophobic and was not enjoyable. In addition the ruins offered were very minimal and not that impressive.Overall I would only recommend this site to independent travellers very keen on archeological sites.

If not, I've heard very good if the guides available at the church itself, especially Diana."

The admission fees are decent unlike the cathedral at the Plaza with its ridiculous rates. Admission fees are 10 sols and you get a perspective of the size of the Incan main temple from the size of the church as well as the scale model of the Incan temple. Kiddos for the monks in preserving the ancient Incan temple rather than destroying it and keeping mum about it after independence from the Spanish. The paintings, rooms, decorations found on the church are certainly astounding and mouth dropping. Certainly worth 1-2 hours of your time . The paintings are very Peruvian and its perspective on religion very interesting based on local perception. Certainly the best attraction in Cusco region other than Machu Picchu.Walking distance from the Plaza and a pleasant area to hang around."

All of the still existing Inca structures were at one point plastered over and still show small flakes of the white plaster in the pores of the stone. It is quite distressing. I also almost wish they would put a new replica sun disc where it used to be, because currently there is an out of use well with flowers around it. The highlight was the Rainbow temple, with the smallest rock ever used by the Incas."

There is an area with a stunning painting of the Milky Way, and our guide explained the significance of the galaxy to the Incans. In addition, there is a copy of an interpretive table, the original of which was purportedly made of gold. The table is full of symbols, an explanation of which is nearby. It is a sheltered place to wander around, and thus a good choice for the rainy season."

Koricancha was an important Inca site long before the Spanish descended on Peru and built the Convent around it. In South America, Convent can be used as a term to house either priests or nuns. In this case, priests live there, and their area is understandably off-limits to tourists. However, I did get to see a group of them in their traditional Dominican vestments and it was impressive. You get the best of both worlds here, first with the Incan architecture and its unbelievable joining of perfectly-chiseled blocks, to the breathtaking, huge oil paintings which adorn the walls of the lovely courtyard. The Incan portion is actually built to withstand seismic activity, and there is a very interesting alignment of windows allowing you to see through several of the rooms if you are standing on a small stepping-stone to raise your eyes to the proper level to observe this part of the structure. Again, a guide is essential here if you want the full experience. An alternative is to purchase a guide book, or research on Wikipedia prior to your visit. There are lovely gardens arranged on terraces, and the view from the hillside is spectacular."

Second, if you come across a tour guide outside who is very pushy, don't go with her. We thought it would be interesting to go with a guide, but kept refusing her offers as it was really expensive. She kept lowering the price and hassling us and other tourists until she got a group together of mildly interested people, but then spent the first 5 minutes of the tour still hassling tourists to join the group. She had told us the tour would last 45 minutes but answered her phone at the beginning of the tour and we overheard her tell her friend she would meet them outside in 25 minutes, not realising we understood Spanish. When I asked her if the tour was really going to be only 25 minutes she looked pretty embarrassed. The tour she gave was terrible. She spoke really fast in English and had a strong accent so the group could barely understand her and when we asked her to repeat she was cold and looked annoyed that we hadn't understood the first time. She gave very little information and whisked us around, making us want to revisit the site without her at the end as we felt like we'd missed out on a lot. I don't know if all tour guides are as bad as her, but I would recommend just going by yourselves."

The structure is preserved very well in spite of the damages done by Spanish invaders- thanks to the Peruvian Government and UNESCO!"

One can see and appreciate the beautifully fitted Inca stones at the base of the Convent (best done from the Av. el Sol). One can only marvel at their workmanship and engineering. In the Convent, you can see several of the original temple rooms -- they are so precise and beautifully crafted that one might think they were modern.

Edwin showed us around Cusco during a walking tour and provided quite a bit of great detail on the site and the city itself. I think we definitely got a lot out of having a guide that showed us around. My recommendation would be to go mid-morning or early-morning. It seemed like many schools were visiting the sites of Cusco frequently in the morning, so try and get there either before a lot of the school children do or slightly after. While the afternoon would be great, things tend to clear up in the afternoon and you can get some beautiful photos of the outdoor sites, so spend your morning inside here when the skies are still a little grey."

My wife and I didn't hire a guide and kind of wish we did, after the fact."

            "review": "Ah, Folks, We Missed It by 475 Years. I'm intrigued by the gist of almost all reviewers comments( some had \"guides\"--Lord knows what their training and qualifications were--some did, but I'm left with very strong suspicion that the majority of visitors left not knowing what they missed. A few things I noted: (A) \"guides\" pointed to and talked about what was there almost exclusively, NOT what was missing; (B) whether with your groups or not, visitors almost all circled around the periphery of the courtyard without taking much or even ANY time to view; (C) the large placards providing information are remarkably coy about what used to be there, and suggest that the stories were probably exaggerated, and even mention mythic legends about long-lost buried Inca treasure. There really isn't must serious historic controversy about what was in Coricancha or about what happened to it. I'm not a tour guide, but I would like to lay out a few things about that central courtyard, for the benefit of future TripAdvisor readers headed that way Here goes:Coricancha is Quechua for Golden Enclosure. Six buildings enclosed the Inti Pampa (Quechua: Field of Gold). They were temples to the Sun, Moon, Stars, Lightning, and the Rainbow, plus ceremonial quarters for the priests of the Sun. The current surviving ruins do surround the courtyard, which does have a fountain in its center, making it a likely candidate to have been the Inki Pampa. The Dominican monastery was built on top of the Sun Temple, but various archaeologists may have competing theories. The buildings surrounding the Inki Pampa were gold- plated--not gold leaf, but gold plate, each sheet weighing several pounds (I.e. that now-naked stone wall your tour guide is pointing out).But the really mind-boggling thing was the Inka Pampa itself, the \"Field of Gold.\" Here's what the conquistadores found there when they took the city: a field of grass surrounding the fountain, which was broken up here and there where holes in the earth were poked to permit planting of rows of maize, which were now ripe for the harvest. Llamas were grazing on the grass, under the watchful eyes of Inca shepherds. EXCEPT all of this was beautifully crafted out of gold.. The dirt was gold; the grass and corn silk was finely spun gold wire. Everything was so masterfully done that it looked real. The centerpiece of the fountain was a golden figure of the sun, given by Pizarro to one of his captains as his share of the loot. However the nouveau riche conquistador got drunk and lost it gambling that very night, resulting in an old Spanish expression for a spendthrift, \"to lose the sun before the dawn.\" Pedro de Cieza de Leon, who 12 years later spoke to many Spaniards who had seen the Inka Pampa, wrote of \"the garden where clods were pieces of fine gold\" as well as the \"cornfields ... The stems of the leaves and the cobs. Beside this they had more than twenty llamas of gold with their young, with the shepherds life-sized with their slings and crooks to watch them ... all made of gold.\" Nor are these tall tales, because accompanying the expedition at the time was the King's fiscal representative, who kept careful records of the valuables that Pizarro and his men seized (to ensure Carlos V got his Royal Fifth.) This inspector, Miguel de Estete, recorded officially that he saw \"straws made of solid gold, with their spikes just as they grow in the field, and if I was to record all the different varieties in the shape of gold my story would never end.\" Elsewhere Estete records of one haul, \"Four llamas in fine gold and very large, ten or twelve figures of women, natural size, all of fine gold and so beautiful and well made it seemed as if they were alive.\"For the most part, as per royal orders, these extraordinary masterpieces of the goldsmith's are were melted down into ingots, as were the silver masterpieces. However, some of the works were so extraordinary beautiful that even the crude conquistadores (most of them, like Pizarro, could neither read nor write) couldn't bring themselves to destroy them, and shipped those supreme examples of Inca art to the Spanish court as they were. Needless to say, Carlos V was livid on hearing of this, and issued an edict (13 Feb 1535) that if any such cargo was received \"all gold and silver from Peru shall be melted in the royal mints at Seville, Toledo and Segovia.\" Not a single piece shipped to Spain survives. I'm submitting a photo of the courtyard to TA. It's not a BAD courtyard surrounded by bare stone Inca rooms, But compared to what the Inki Pampa WAS, it's rather like going to some some dusty anthropology museum and seeing a 500-year-old female human skeleton that used to belong to Amerigo Vespucci's sister-in-law Simonetta. Not a BAD skeleton, but about the same time Spanish functionaries were melting the Field of Gold into ingots, leaving what you see in the Coricancha courtyard now, (and Amerigo was making a name for himself in the --er-- Americas),Simonetta was posing for Sandro Botticelli's Birth of Venus. The loss of her beauty was naturally inevitable; the loss of The Golden Enclosure, however, was not. But standing in that courtyard now can be a richer, if sadder, experience if you try to visualize the way it looked the day before the Spaniards arrived."

Some parts of the original sun temple remain and you can see how the lego-like blocks and construction were perfectly cut and aligned using only stone tools.

It was also the site of the main astronomical observatory of the Incas as well as being the centre of the Cusco Seque System that defined the social organisation of the Inca empire. Following the Spanish colonization, the Inca temples were destroyed and upon its foundation a baroque Dominican Convent of Santo Domingo was built. On-site, the main attraction is the fine masonry of the Inca seen from the outside as a 6m high curved stone wall that formed the western foundation of the convent. Inside, four original chambers of the Inca temples have been uncovered, showing the perfectly fitted stone masonry and the niches typical of Inca buildings.

As we approached the temple, we were accosted by many potential guides. I was skeptical at first, but we ended up hiring the one who seemed the least shady. His name was Adolfo and he ended up being the best part of the visit. I would recommend hiring a guide if you can find one you feel comfortable with.Adolfo did a terrific job of explaining the history and development of the site (and even brought his own book with diagrams and examples), but the star of Coricancha is the architecture itself. The Incan construction methods have stood the test of time. It's hard to imagine how anyone could hand-cut rocks to fit so perfectly together at any time, let alone at the time of the temple's construction. All of the colonial work built on top crumbled in subsequent earthquakes...so I guess there's a metaphor in there somewhere.Scattered throughout the complex are various calendars and celestial markings, in which shadows perfectly align to mark the solstices and other important dates.While Coricancha is no longer bathed in gold as in the time of the conquistadors, the design, history and wonder of this site made it one of the best places to visit in Cusco."

Some of the original temple walls were too well built to be easily dismantled and are still in place and can be viewed from inside and outside the church. However, the Dominicans still occupy a large part of the site and have not permitted archaeologists access depriving the people of Peru of cultural and historical information about their past.

The inside is a very different view, almost bare and compact. The courtyard/gardens are beautiful and we were told it's still an active church. Visit the individual rooms for each one has a different story. You can even see a small repair to a stone -- quite ingenious. Take a walk through the entire inside and make sure you go inside the museum. There are exhibits with historic explanations, even in English.We visited this Convent twice. The first time was with a guide but he rushed us through so fast that we only were shown the items he thought were interesting.

Situated at an elevation of 11,150 feet, Cuzco was laid out on a grid plan in the shape of a puma, a sacred mountain lion. The pre-Inca site of Sacsayhuaman, on a plateau near the northern edge of the city, forms the head of the puma and the Coricancha temple forms the center of the grid..After the Spanish conquest in 1532, the Qorikancha fell to Juan Pizarro, one of Francisco Pizarro's brothers. Before his death, Juan Pizarro donated the Qorikancha to the Dominican Order.

This church was located literally right across the street from the hotel we stayed at Inka Palace, so obviously we could not resist going inside. Once inside I was amazed to see all of the grand artwork. All paintings appeared to be held within gold cased frames. There were too many urns and vases to count, and the paint on them seemed brand new (it was so bright and clear).The center of the church actually holds some incredible ruins. This church was built in/around an exisitng structure. During the visit, you walk through exisiting \"Inka-style\" structures. The walls/stonework here is not ealborate but is certainly of a high \"caliber\" of artistry. Stonework is very smooth/polished, windows are squared, walls are straight (even today). and rooms are linear; you can look through one set of windows, and line up to a wall three levels back. All rooms seemed level.What was most interesting to me was to see the devastation left from the many earthquakes which have hit Cuzco in the past. In particular, there are paintings/pictures from a major earthquake, which toppled a good portion of the church and the city itself. The remaining structure was used as a foundation for this \"new\" church.Almost every night of our stay, there were dozens of weddings - complete with fireworks on the plaza - at this church. There were also many communions, and funerals, so obviously this is not only a histrical site, but also a functioning house of worship."

As historic sights go, the entrance fee is one of the more reasonable at 10 soles (about $4). Definitely worth a visit with or without a guide.

Also of interest is the collection of art created by local Quechua artists who were not allowed to sign their work (they weren't Spanish, after all!) but who were able to put their cultural stamp on so many of the paintings -- people of color, coca leaves in the paintings hidden in plain sight, Quechua symbols of the sun and moon.

At the time of the Spanish conquest, it consisted on numerous one story temples who's interior walls were lined with entire sheets of gold and housed many gold idols and religious symbols. The Spanish immediately pried the gold from the walls and, together with the idols, melted them to pour into gold bars. Needless to say, this was desecration of the highest order to the Incan population, who were aghast with shock.Then the Spanish leveled all but a scant few temples and constructed an enormous church on the site. For some reason, they left a few of the temples, which were used as domestic chambers for the clergy until earlier this century. They also built another floor and story over one set, until thankfully an earthquake significantly damaged the colonial structure which then allowed for the Incan temples to be made available for public viewing ( of course, the Incan stonework held perfectly! ).A must see for all who visit Cusco and have an interest in Incan history. However, either read the historical accounts, or hire a guide or else you will not understand what is to be seen."

The temple of the sun - variously spelled with a C, Q or K - was the most important temple within the entire Incan empire, so naturally the conquistadores stripped it of gold and silver, and built a Dominican church on top, as part of their programme to destroy the indigenous culture and impose a Spanish Christian one. Originally the walls and floors were entirely covered in precious metals, but that was all removed and melted down 500 years ago. Since the Incans were not ones for decorative carvings, you have to use your imagination quite a bit here, as sadly all that remains are part of the outer wall and some internal structures, with a colonial-era cloister and church planted on top. The Incan stonework in the Qoricancha is of amazing quality and it's almost embarrassing to see the relatively poor quality of the church construction, heavily reliant on thick layers of mortar to hold it together. To get the most out of this its best to hire one of the freelance guides loitering outside for around S/20 (\u00a35) - this is on top of the entrance fee of about the same - although take some of what they say with a pinch of salt. The \"altar for sacrificing llamas\" is clearly far too small to do any such thing, for example. The Dominican church itself is also worth a look although it pales in comparison with the cathedral and the Jesuit church on the Plaza de Armas, and it does of course contain the usual gory, blood-soaked Andean Catholic iconography. As with all Andean church sites, no photography is allowed inside, either with or without flash."

First, it boasts exquisite architecture the subtleties are at first hard to notice but once shown, are hard to get out of your mind. Second, the meaning of the site. It was their most holy temple, built on top of an older pre-Incan site, it housed not only representations of their theology, and the holy families, but also their ancestors in the form of mummies. Third, the history of the site. This proud legacy was abruptly stamped out by the Catholics who started ripping down the site to use for their church (which is built around it) and they burned the Incan ancestors forcing the inhabitants to watch. If you are in Cusco you have to see it."

The temple was not only used for various religious rites, but served as an observatory for the high priests to monitor celestial activity. Some of the remaining chambers adjacent to the courtyard were dedicated to the moon and the stars, and to thunder and the rainbow. The Spanish colonialists intentionally chose this site, and destroyed most of the Inca temple in the building of the church, in order to further suppress the Inca religion. However, not all of the temple was destroyed. The original tightly interlocking, mortar free, stonework that remains is regarded as some of the finest Inca trapezoidal architecture in Peru. The temple was dedicated primarily to the Inca Sun God, and the main courtyard was covered with hundreds of gold sheets. All of the gold was later stripped and melted down to pay the Spanish a ransom for the life of the Inca leader, Atahualpa, who nonethelesswas later excuted by the Spanish following a mock trial."

Basically, Koricancha was the \"Temple of the Sun\" of the Incas at the time when the Spaniards first arrived. According to written records the temple was filled with life-size trees, lamas, people etc. solid gold statues. You could imagine the effect of this sight upon the gold crazy Europeans. To the Incans however, gold was not valued the same way. It had religious significance especially in association with the Sun god, Inti. Hence the whole temple was filled with gold. There is a legend that there was a giant gold disc, larger than an man, at one point. It was positioned in the temple such that when the sunlight hits it through some window opening, the disc would scatter the sunlight and bath the whole inside of the temple in a golden glow. This disc mysteriously disappeared between the time of the first party of Spaniards arriving and the main contingent. It has never been found .... I feel an Indiana Jones movie coming on. How cool is that?! Ok, I'm side tracking. Anyway as with everything else the Spanish conquistadors did to demoralize the locals, they dismantled most of the temple and built a Dominican monastery over the top of it. However, they did keep the foundation and some of the walls of the temple and just incorporated it into the monastery. So the effect is rather unique. You really get to see a good example of Incan building technology that is different than most other Incan ruins elsewhere. The Temple of the Sun was an important building in the heart of Cuzco, the capital of the Incan empire. The lines are much more uniform and regular than other places. It's just 10 Soles to enter here. It's well worth a visit."

Only the smoothly curved shaped walls, amongst the finest in Inca architecture, remained, and served as the base to the Santo Domingo Convent, church and cloister. While the Inca structure stood both earthquakes (1650 and 1950), the church was demolished first and its later reconstruction badly damaged in the second instance.As we went to visit the site with our private guide, Angel, we were impressed by the Inca structure (oddly having as background the cloister and the bell-tower of the church).

The Temple of the Sun of the Incas (Coricancha) is believed to be the most important temple of the Incan empire, and the most revered temple in Cusco. Unfortunately, when the Spaniards came, they built the Church of Santo Domingo on the site demolishing the temple, and using its foundation for the cathedral. From the outside, the walls of the original temple (clearly of Incan masonry technique of very closely interlocking stones without mortars) can be seen. Inside the site, are some of the temples (most probably reconstructed or restored) depicting the precise and incredible masonry building techniques of the Incas. Some of the structures have significant astronomical significance related to solstices and equinox, and the builiding techniques appear to have been made by tools beyond the capabilities of the Incas. When visiting the site, a guide is a must because there is a paucity of information about the items and structures within the site.Walking outside the Church of Santo Domingo, one encounters the other walls of the temple, again built in the characteristic Incan masonry technique. This site incorporates structures important and/or sacred to the Incas, similar to the House of the Sun at Machu Picchu and the Ollantaytambo Temple sites.If you are an Incan history buff, this is a must see attraction. It is very close to the Plaza Mayor of Cusco and the Cusco Cathedral."

This iconic ruin, substantially restored and in excellent shape, is now part of the Monastery of Santo Domingo, not to be confused with the Cathedral Church of the same name in the same city.At one time it was the main shine of the Inca Empire and presided over by 4,000 priests. When religions clash, temples crumble, and this apparent masterpiece was almost eliminated by incorporation into a monastery serving another God but the Sun. Our excellent guide pointed out the main features of Inca architecture to be observed in what is left and restored of the original: the large carefully carved closely fiting mortar-free brick work inclined on a slight angle to resist earthquake damage; continued upwards with adobe plaster; and crowned with an inverted V-shaped wooden roof; the niches that held decorative and religious objects almost certainly of gold and precious stones; and the evidence of other decorative work in layers of gold probably adorning the walls. There is a lovely broad arcaded courtyard, and as you exit, the terraced landscaped lawns descend majestically to the street below.Many examples abound of the astronomical uses of this space, employing observance and analysis of shadows through slits and shafts shifting with the movement of the earth. Multiple smaller temples dedicated to deities other than the Sun were also part of the larger complex, and some traces still remain. Thus, while a mere shadow of its former glory, there is enough to provide great insight into how Inca Science and Religion worked in co-operation. What is no longer there is a loss that should never have occured."

It fuses a great deal of Catholic theology with a smattering of Inca superstition. Completed in 1654 after 100 years of construction, using stones from neighbouring Inca temples in the hills around the city. It can be described as a an unorthodox Catholic church that show some interesting pagan Inca influences. The attractive facade has Gothic and Baroque elements. The interior is in the form of a Latin cross and contains many attractive features: a large silver alterpiece; authentic early Spanish paintings, one being a stunning crucifixion in the manner of Van Dyck: a dramatic wooden statue known as the Black Christ whose colour is the result of charring; and a host of later paintings by Inca artists working under Spanish supervision who nevertheless managed to infiltrate several of their works with Inca motifs. Sculptural references to the Inca religion, such as the Sun, and a large stone puma, are also to be found. The sheer size of the space is intimidating, and there is a handsome tower holding a large bell, now cracked, and used only occasionally. I believe that entrance is free but cannot swear to it. In any event, it is not to be missed."

The Spanish had completely covered over the Incan temple using it as a foundation for the Church. An earthquake in 1950 exposed the ruins when the Spanish walls fell and the Incan ones held fast. Today, inside the church you can see the remains of the Incan temple walls, perhaps the finest example of Incan engineering and stonework. You can see how the Inca cut the stones to lock together and how the Spanish built directly on top of those walls. If you are in Cusco, you really need to see this site."

I love this building in particular, an old Inca temple gracefully turned into a church, but you wont know it unless you get in and see the old ruins, so well preserved. The structure itself has so much character, inside out, it is imposing from far away still friendly when you approach it. Awesome! Might get crowded at the entrance and it is not very cheap but once you get inside you'll know why.

On entry we went into the large central courtyard for the initial rundown of the history of the place as main Inca temple in Cusco that was then taken over and partial destroyed by the Spanish and rebuilt as theirs. I found the courtyard the most beautiful and interesting.We went from room to room with our guide giving us detailed history of each temple that was in each part of the place. The contrast between the Inca and Spanish architecture is evident in many places. The detailed history was a bit much for me, I would have rather wandered around more and looked at the impressive paintings under the archways. Don't miss the back gardens, you go out the front and around the outside. You can't go in but it is beautiful to look at, much prettier than the front in my opinion. This is a must see for visitors, but do some research yourself and maybe skip the guide unless you want an in-depth history of the place."

Q'oricancha was the most amaizing building ever dedicated to the mos important deity THE SUN!! consider by the Inkas as the most noblest of Gods. Tayta Inty = \"Father Sun\" along with Mother Earth - Pachamama = Pacha=Time, mama=Mother, both were essential to their profound spirituality.Q'oricancha housed amazing wealth to the eyes of the Spaniards but for the InKas these richness were nothing more then showing off reverence, worship and love. The Inkas believe that gold was the blood of the Sun - Inty and Silver of the Moon - Q'illa. The perls tears of Cochamama - Cocha=Sea - mama= Mother.As Pedro Cieza de Leon describes based on the actual description of the 3 first Spaniards whom set foot in Cusco commissioned by Francisco Pizarro who were sent to oversee the place of which they heard was immensely rich where they could find lots of treasures, gold, silver etc... The richness they witness was absolutely incredible, they couldn't believe their eyes. The people there (being the religious center of the Inka Empire) were dressed basically adorned in gold and precious stones without a care in the world... They welcome them and show the around to calm their curiosity...They were taking to the Q'oricancha - Temple of the Sun, what they had seen was something they couldn't be describe in words... In the Center of the building which it was quite big stood a circle that irradiate blinding light when the Sun set on the center. It was surrounded by a garden which contained replicas of all the natural products grown in all the Tawantinsuyo Empire. There was corn made out of gold exactly as the real one in size and beauty having pearls as kernels, potatoes imitating in gold to the real in color, size and variety, the plants of Q'uinwa - Quinoa - quinua. Q'iwicha, Ollucos etc. etc. all designed in perfect image of the real plants. The building it self was \"wallpaper\" with sheets of gold and silver.. Woman serve the Sun... Nustas and Mamaconas... Virgins of the Sun, young and old all were dedicated first to the Sun and the Inka their entire lives, chosen from early age, all beautiful, full of pride, well dressed in finery and adorned with gold and silver jewelery. Parents will look forward to have their daughters chosen cause was a deep honor to have at least one serving their God- Tayta Inti. As soon as Pizarro arrived chaos came... The Inka people realized for what they came for and tried to give them what they asked to save their lives but it was useless, The Spaniards and the Catholic Church was set to destroy this Empire from within as much as the had destroyed the Islands now Central America. From this Temple of the Sun came to Cajamarca the ransom paid by Atahuallpa to Pizarro for his life. The Spaniards still killed him under the excuse of him betraying their trust.The rest of the gold that was found in all the temples and palaces were melted and sent to Spain. The Disk of the Sun - Inti? nobody knows what happened to it. Pizarro didn't get to see it by then a lot of gold as Cieza describes were thrown into the lakes, hiding and buried who knows where. A lot of the Inka people run for their lives to the high mountains and plateaus, others threw themselves after tying themselves to their children, woman, animals and treasures from the high mountains to the abyss so was not to fall in servitude or be kill... The noble people of Peru couldn't understand the unquenchable thirst of Gold, how the Spaniards and the Catholic church in the name of their God will try to exterminate them... As later writers say... The people of the Inka Empire were living a dream... when the Spaniards arrived the woke up to a nightmare and they're still living it. They were left with nothing, taking away their identity and their pride... most of all their sense of belonging. What is left of what once was a great TEMPLE to the Sun Inti, now it's only a sad reminder of human greediness... A sad reminder of what once was a great culture to revere, learn from it and not to have destroyed as it was destroyed.My best regards to whom ever will read my comment."

Often had to wait for one tour group leave an area first. When leaving, no line for entrance. Also there is alot of uneven walking areas. In one section you have to step down quite low and step back up high. Some people did need assistance in these area.Also there is a small climb from the street to the entrance.

It has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The cathedral was built on the site of the most important Inca Temple, the Temple of the Sun, or Korikancha. And it is one of many sites where the Spanish incorporated Inca stonework into the structure.The facade of the cathedral reflects the Spanish Baroque-style architecture. Inside are a number of important artifacts including the two altars, the sacristy, and the Black Christ:. The wooden crucifix is black from centuries of smoke and dust. It remains in that condition as it was not cleaned during restoration of the cathedral interior during the 1990s, when the burning of candles was ended. "

One might thus expect. Lot from it. Unfortunately, so did the Spanish, and they not only trashed the original structures but used the foundations for a monastery and church in order to utterly crush the Inca power structures. In this they were unfortunately successful. The foundations and lower courses are inca in design, and there have been rebuilds to the 'treasure houses' and other smaller structures in the covered courtyard area. The original Qoriqancha was a series of thatched buildings in a compound, which held most of the Inca's wealth down to gold llamas (allegedly). Little effort has been made to show how it was, however. The data available are a little half hearted, and there is one rather feeble reconstruction. Far too much attention has been paid to the colonial overburden, including religious robes and the enormously overrated and disappointing Cusco school paintings, which have a lot of highly academic explication which would be better spent on the Inca sections of the structure. So...disappointing. The gardens and outdoor areas are very pretty, however."

Amazing stone work that shows you how percise the Incas were in laying stone walls that needed no cement or mortar to hold together. Beautiful views of the remaining portion of the temple. Very nice place to visit to witness the clash of two civilizations where one imposed itself on the other."

I also recommend taking a look at the library itself: some of the materials owned by the monks might surprise you !"

It was very busy in there, and our tour guide cut corners (or so I assume) to get through it as quickly as possible. Of the four spiels she gave, I couldn't hear what she was saying for two of them and the next thing I knew, we were being herded out! This site is worth a visit, but I would recommend you go on your own armed with some literature to help you observe and learn on your own terms."

Although technically it refers to just the Inca Temple, \u201cQorikancha\u201d for purposes of this review is a hybrid building containing groundwork elements of the Inca Sun Temple with the superimposed colonial church and convent of Santo Domingo. After the conquest of Cusco, Francisco Pizarro gave it to his brother Juan but the latter died soon thereafter and it was willed to the Dominicans who built a convent on top of the pilfered remains of the temple. The current structure is a striking hybrid of construction methods.We visited while on a walking tour of the city with a private guide who explained the remaining Inca structures and how they fit into what evidently was the richest temple in the empire. After entering the courtyard we visited many separate interior temples (thunder, rainbow, moon, etc.) with impressive stone architecture. There are also numerous mini-exhibits on astronomy and history (with English signage!) that complete your understanding of the building in the context of the Inca Empire before the conquest. The exterior of the building is impressive as well, with a garden facing the street that provides a good backdrop for the requisite tourist pictures.The building itself is not only interesting in its own right but functions as a visual metaphor for the Spanish \u201cConquest of the Americas\u201d and all of the vibrancy associated with that collision of cultures. A must visit for even the most casual tourist."

            "review": "A Well Done Museum, Worth a Visit. Built on top of the Koricancha, the largest Incan temple of the sun, in 1532, Iglesia de Santo Domingo was a monastery, a convent, and a university where Spanish priests could learn the local Quechua language, required before they could do missionary work.It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1650, but was restored about 30 years later. Today, it is a museum, and quite a good one at that. This is one of those places that is best to visit without a guide so you can take your time. There is adequate signage, and the place is quite beautiful. It's amazing how it fits so perfectly into the ancient Inca temple. This will take you an hour or two to visit, quite worthwhile."

But if you go in the late afternoon during the high season, you barely get a chance to look at it! We went with a guided group tour, as did apparently the rest of the city of Cusco. The was barely room to move around, and it was too loud to hear anything. We had to push people to get a look at the stones. So, while this site is almost certainly worth seeing, try to see it when the crowds are lower, or you may wish you hadn't gone at all."

            "review": "A Must See in Cuzco. I completely agree with the other reviewers - one of the best sites in the city of Cuzco. I visited several museums on my last day in Cuzco, Qorikancha was the last and certainly did not disappoint. This museum was very modern, cool and informative. The main part of the museum explained the importance of the site as the Capitol building of the Inka Empire with explanations of the Inca Walls that make up much of the convents foundations. They had additional exhibits displaying Christian art from the 14-18 centuries, much of which produced over the years at their on-campus art school. Not to lose the kiddos, there was also an exhibit of contemporary Peruvian art - it was a small section but very hip and completely unexpected."

One of our favorite parts was the large mural that depicted the various constellations as the Incans saw and named them. Altogether a must-see."

From the Inca/Spanish mixture to paintings that hung on the walls, to the courtyard in the middle of it, to the beautiful gardens and blue skies.What a beautiful country! They are trying to preserve it, and with more education and knowledge I know they will succeed.If you get a chance, read \"Last of the Inca Kings\", it brought home to me, the rich history of this church, and all the surroundings!"
