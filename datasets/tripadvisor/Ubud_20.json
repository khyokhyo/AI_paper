            "review": "Wow. We spontaneously decided to visit the Tegenungan waterfall after visiting Bali Safari and Marine Park. It was our last day here, so despite not having our swim wear, we still decided to go to visit the falls. We had to pay 5000 per person to enter the waterfalls area. Some guy tried to sell us his tickets in front of the ticket office, claiming that he didn't use them, but the staff stopped him. We decided to purchase the tickets from the office instead because we don't know what the guy's intention was. We later found out that they don't take or check your ticket, so the guy probably entered the waterfall and just wanted to sell them. But they were just 5000 per person! You have to walk down some big steps to arrive at the waterfalls. It was easier to walk down those stairs wearing running shoes, but it would be more convenient to wear flip flops if you're gonna get wet. There were many people at the waterfalls and we totally regret not having our swimwear. It was beautiful. After visiting the waterfalls, we went to sit down in one of those cafes to have a coconut while enjoying the view of the falls."

A lot of photo ops and the ability to go into the wade pool below the waterfall as well as view the waterfall from the top. We got some really good pictures and got to cool off since the humidity is super crazy in Bali. It is a super steep walk back so be prepared for that. We saw a few people have to stop a couple times because it was very strenuous on them. As far as the actual wade pool it was a little dirty due to the rain and we were warned by hotel staff and our driver that some times it's not ideal to even go in the water so be aware of that too. Definitely a nice place to visit, but I think if we ever visited again we would find another waterfall that may be less frequented and ruined by so many tourists and trash."

He took us here. It didn't look like the cleanest water to be swimming in but that didn't stop the tourists & locals. I read reviews where people have seen rubbish & used sanitary pads floating in the water whilst swimming there. Errr....gross. We came here just to see it, not to swim though. The waterfalls don't take much of an effort to get to. From the street it is maybe a 5min walk down a steep set of stone stairs. We could go right up close to the bottom of the falls & feel the mist of the water crashing at the bottom. Pretty impressive & powerful! It was so humid when we went. Sweat non-stop. And walking back up the stairs was a bit tiring even for us young folk. So drink lots of water. "

The entrance fee is IDR 10.000 / person (locals or foreigners). There are several shops and toilets (IDR 3000/person).If you want to go here, make sure you are fit because you must take the stairs to go down to the waterfall. I don't know for sure how many steps but it was a bit steep. It took 10-15 minutes to get there.After you arrive in the waterfall, you can go up to the waterfall but you have to cross the small wooden bridge and take another stairs (not so many). Don't forget to pay another IDR 10.000 / person to go to the top.Anyway, you can swim and play around in the waterfall. Just be careful because it was a bit slippery.Overall, this place is one of the great outdoor activities in Bali.Visit in October 2016."

There were quite a few people in the water and around. The water was not perfectly clear, however it looked good fun to be under the waterfall and behind. You can climb up the other side to see the drop if you don't mind a few log bridges and more stepsThere are a lot of fairly large concrete steps down to the river- what goes down must come up. Personally, we took our time coming up ( we are pensioners) and had no problem. We had, for 25K, a coconut in the cafe on the right after the steps- it was straight from the fridge, opened in front of us- with two straws we had more than enough to drink ( we eventually took it back to our car)- well worth the walk back up the steps for!"

Was a tad too crowded when we went there but hey, if you decide to have fun, then there is nothing that stops you. One can go right under the falls. Do try and walk behind the falls and sitting behind the rocks. It's the best feeling ever as the water splashes on you with force and the feeling is equivalent to a massage. The sound of water splashing is soothing to the ears and its a bound to make you reach a state of bliss. The best part is -- one need not necessarily know swimming to enjoy all the above.It's not advisable for people with knee issues or older members of the family who may not be physically fit as there are about 150 steps to the falls most of which are quite steep. There is no wheelchair options etc. Good thing is there are paid restrooms en route which is no very common otherwise."

Nice place to take a dip during your way to Ubud from South Bali.Entrance fee is IDR 10,000 per person, then you have to walk steps down for about 200-300 meters from the parking area.There you have a big pond with the waterfall which you can dip in.. Water looks clean, however do be careful because the landing is rocks and could be quite slippery... It is also possible to go up to the top of the waterfall, however do bring some money coz you have to pay another ticket to go there ( another IDR 10,000 per pax)A bit sad that the locals didn't really develop the area to be neat.

Not recommended for old people due to the steep steps..."

I would advise anyone going there to do some precautions: do not leave your clothes on the rocks around the waterfalls as this does not protect them at all from water and once you return from your swim, your clothes will be also very wet. To fix this you can pay around 10 000 rupees to the kisok on the way and get a locker with a key. The view from above was also very nice, and swimming is safe and easy. very enjoyable"

Once down there we found a place to stow our bags (I wish I had left my stuff in the car for safe keeping) and jumped into the water. The spray of the water and the sound of it crashing into the pool at the bottom is intense, but wonderful. Fortunately my two kids are great swimmers, so they were fine, but I'd keep extra close to any kids who are not totally competent in the water. The water current is strong and the rocky bottom can make walking in the water unsteady. We had an absolute blast playing in the water and slowly but surely getting closer and closer to the waterfall as we became comfortable. But, I kept reminding my kids to respect the water- it is incredibly powerful and it is apparent that one over-confident move could lead to an accident. This is one tourist attraction in which you get to actively engage with the site, rather than just look at something, and we all loved it!"

Lots of people were basically just stood around gawping at girls posing in bikinis for instagram. Theres a lot of building work going on around the waterfall and a market selling tat at the entrance."

We didn't know that we can swim, but once from the enter (entry only Rp10k or USD0.80, for domestic and international tourists) you saw lot of people swimming then we decided to go back to our car to change our clothes to swimming attire. Lot of rest room with only paying Rp2,000 or Rp3,000 (USD0.20) if you want to change your clothes and they were clean.It was about 100+ steps to go down, and for me going down is fine but going up is quite tiresome since the step is not that low step but quite high (around 40cm apart, I believe normal step should be about 20 cm high apart). However it was worth it after showering and getting massage from the waterfall. If you bring the waterproof camera it will be better to take some pictures in the middle of the water falls.There were lots of tourists sunbathing in the area. We just left our stuffs nearby and I thought it was safe, anyway the tourists who just lying next to our stuffs can guard it.We went to middle and top of the falls as well but we had to pay extra Rp10k each, but it was worth it to see the views.If you go to Ubud, go this place."

The current is very strong in the water so it is almost impossible to stand under the fall (it also hurts haha) but I would recommend doing it for at least 5 second. Also, if you swim on the side of it you will feel absolutely reenergized from the amount of energy it has. Met 2 girls there who felt the same way!"

I hadnt realised that gettibg to thd waterfall itself can be a little challenging with many steep stairs to negotiate and not alot of railings to hang onto so one needs to take care .The waterfall itself is quite large but worth the walk out into the water to refresh.The force from the falls is quite string and the tide will move you along.A rrip across to the other side will give you access to the top and there are drinks for sale here too.The bigger challenge for me was negotiating the stairs to the top , best to take out at your own pace and i wouldnt recommend the journey for those with bad ankles or knees...my thighs were sore for days after ."

The place was completely overtaken by sellers at the entrance and there is even a service of renting beds to lay in the sun or a shed to change clothes. Also, if you want to go to the mid and top levels of the waterfall you have to pay extra on the way up the water (not much extra, just 10.000IDR a person). That was the best decision we made. The top is pretty and it's rather empty as most people rather stay on the bottom, soaking up on water...Especially considering the waterfalls we visited after, it was quite underwhelming. Pretty nonetheless, and if you are not able to travel more upnorth, it is a good waterfall to experience."

There seems to be two ways to access the waterfall and we took the less touristy route (not on purpose, it was the entrance we had chosen from Google maps). It was 10,000 IDR (about 60p) to enter and there are quite a few steps to go up and down but it was great. The route we went takes you to three stages: top of the waterfall, middle and bottom. The top was incredible, peering over the top and understanding just how high the drop was. As it had been raining loads the water was really strong and was gushing over the edge. The water was also very brown as apparently it washes all the dirt etc down from the mountains after heavy rain. We then made our way down to the middle to get a different perspective, and you could feel the spray coming off the waterfall. Usually you can swim at the bottom but because the water was dirty following the rain we were unable to swim. It was still a really enjoyable visit."

The water is murky looking because of the sheer force of the water (which exerts a strong pull). There is a enclave you can swim to and enjoy the waterfall from almost behind the curtain of water. Home-made bamboo loungers are available for hire and there is a makeshift bar. The are also beautifully clean toilets (3,000Rp) available at the bottom of the stairs and a nice seating area to purchase and enjoy drinks. Some little shops at top of steps offer free toilet use with a purchase. Be warned, however, the 180 or so steps down are a little treacherous as the steps are uneven and quite high in places (not for people with bad knees) and, in most places, without rails."

It has great scenic potential but still needs many works on the facilities surrounding and going to the falls to make it serene and less rouged for the average traveler."

As such, the water is brownish colour as it's washed down a lot of muds from upstream. Days like this is good for observing and too dangerous to swim.Make sure you have your phones and/or camera in waterproof contraption of some sort because the air is full of water mist from the waterfall. It's slightly harder to go back up for the more unfit type (me included) where you may need to stop once or twice.Tip: There's a nice little area where you can wash off that looks rather nice actually."

A dip in the water is a must so don't forget your swimmers. I saw a few coconuts in the water which may have been washed there from upstream so be very careful going directly into the waterfall. If you so desire you can walk up the water fall and look back down. This is mainly mud track so again care is required. All toilet facilities that I saw required payment.

It is a short drive, maybe 20-30 minutes from the centre of Ubud depending on traffic. There is a fairly large parking area but at peak time this is a busy location. It costs just IDR10k for adults to enter, 5k for children. There are allegedly 200 steps down to the waterfall's base so this is not an accessible attraction. Those who might find clambering up and down in the Indonesian heat a challenge might need to factor in more time.The entrance includes several stalls and eateries in common with many tourist attractions in the country. The steps down are quite large so children can find they need a little help. At the bottom it becomes somewhat muddy so a bit of care is needed.The waterfall itself is not very high but is really quite broad. It thunders down quite impressively. The splash reaches the rocks at the edge of the pool below which can be quite a refreshing experience. Swimming in the pool seems to be popular. Some continue their walk to the ledge near the top of the waterfall. There are no safety precautions so it is up to the individual to manage their own risk. The river that flows away from the waterfall is really quite an attractive feature. Worth spending a moment enjoying natural beauty and the distinction between the calm of the river and the fury of the waterfall."

Once you're in the area, if locals identify you as tourists they'd automatically point you the way to the waterfall as i guess that's the only tourist attraction in the area. Parking and drinks available. Entrance of 10.000RP per person. For us, one of the guides, Johnny followed us (for free but we still gave tips anyway) and guide us through but i think it's pretty easy to navigate down to the waterfall as there are signs. Though some part of the path may be a bit hard to walk through but overall still quite easy and fast to get down to the waterfall. Waterfall was filled with tourists but really beautiful so worth a visit if you're nearby."

It was very busy and the younger crowd seem to be enjoying it more and we're getting into the water. When we went a bride was having her photos taken there. Several places at the top to stop for a drink and also buy some local handicraft too."

You do have to run the gauntlet of people selling things to get to the path and there is a modest entry fee. None of this should be off putting as the sellers are polite enough and didn't really bother us. The path can be a fraction slippery and uneven so you do need to mind your footing. I wouldn't take anyone who is unsteady on their feet. At the bottom of the path were some rocks where I ditched the sun dress and headed in for a sip. A bit like the path, I needed to mind my footing as I got in through the shallows but the joy of swimming in such a gorgeous location, with the spray of the waterfall absolutely made it worth the effort."

This one is pretty amazing and had a huge flow as we caught it after 3 days of on and off rain :) A lot of power and pretty cool rock formations. Check it out from the 3 different levels. River, mid way and top. Be very careful as you go up because the rocks are super slippery and you don't want a freefall!We entered from the east side. Huge parking lot with a few smiley ladies selling cold drinks. Be sure to support the locals! You'll need one after the steep and sweaty hike back up!5000IDR suggested \"donation\" I am cool with paying 50c to be escorted by a local down the steep slippery steps...However, my 1 gripe is all of the TRASH!! Behind a small \"fence\" in the parking lot is a giant mound (landfill). All along the trail going down, along the river and in the river. Trash, trash and more trash. Do you part when visiting to carry a little trash back up and maybe some of the locals hanging out will start to see white man making a difference little by little. Respect thy nature! Don't destroy your natrual beauties :) Enjoy!"

EXPERIENCE: It's quite a walk down to see the waterfall, as you start quite high up in comparison. The stairs are obviously uneven and may be challenging for kids (and adults really!). Once you go down the stairs, you can go swimming in and around the waterfall, take pictures and enjoy the scenery. It's nice that you're able to go swimming as a lot of waterfalls I've visited in other countries don't allow that. There are some vendors around the area selling souvenirs (make sure to barter!) and there is someone at the bottom who was selling cold water (not sure of the price though).OVERALL: I would recommend going to see this waterfall for those in the area! I really enjoyed this stop as it was a beautiful area, and enjoyable for those who want to swim. This isn't for someone who isn't in shape (you don't have to be in ridiculous shape, just able to do about 200 or so uneven steps) and it's not wheelchair accessible."

There are quite a lot of stairs so I don't reccomend if you have back or leg problems.We arrived at the waterfall which wasn't to crowded when we arrived, there was amazing photo opportunities both in front of and if your willing to walk beside the waterfall. In some spots under the waterfall It was quite deep, I was unable to touch the bottom. The current of the waterfall is very strong definitely watch your littlies swimming anywhere near it.The cost to go to the waterfall is 10,000 rp"

It takes only 35 min from Sanur to get there so this waterfall is an accessible stop for many tourists.There is a big parking lot and there were many cars when we arrived there around 11AM. An entrance fee has to be paid before you are allowed to visit the waterfall. The walk to the waterfall takes about 10-15min. Some steps have to be taken and then a small walk along the river. The waterfall itself is not so high but the green surroundings make it a worthwile stop. There were many people swimming under the waterfall which made taking nice pictures a bit more difficult.Not the nicest waterfall in Bali (Sekumpul waterfalls is far more recommended) but good stop as part of a day trip."

At the foot of the steps is a little temple with holy spring water shooting out from different jets that you can shower under as part of a cleansing ritual. Closer to the falls, the path is rocky and damp. Wished we had brought our swim things to join the other people swimming under the falls. Even though it's about as tall as a 5 storey building, there is a huge volume of water that tumbles powerfully over the cliff edge. The water comes from the mountains I'm told by my guide from Amansuka Tour. The water appears to be about waist deep, and then rushes away down the valley. Many of the shops between the carpark and the top of the steps to the falls advertise clean toilets for use for a fee, including one which offers shower facilities. After the exhausting climb back up from the bottom of the falls, we had a chilled coconut to drink with a good view of the falls. A nice outing for the family, come prepared with your swim things."

Today, the falls is crowded and visited by all tourist. It even has a temporary parking area and a booth that collects entry fees when visiting the falls. Restaurants all over the place and also shops selling souvenirs, t-shirts etc..Today all vantage view of the fall is taken or blocked by a restaurant. So from the top you have to pay buy a drink or buy some food to get a good view. The other way is to descend down to the falls which worth the walk. Not too difficult in my opinion and is worth the effort to get a feel of the majestic falls. When you reach below there are also restaurants as well and also a pool with spring water for you to dip in. i recommend this waterfall as i think it is worth the visit anytime you are in the UBUD area."

If you do plan on going in, I would recommend wearing shoes as the combination of current & rocks make egress tricky. Despite other reviews saying you can jump from the waterfall, you can't & nor should you. The only possible place to jump from would have you land in waist depth water!

This was one of our favorite activities of the morning. There was a steep hike down a staircase to get to the river and then a short walk along the river to get to the waterfall. The waterfall itself is beautiful to look at take pictures of, Space although the river itself is too muddy for swimming. There were plenty of places to stop and get a call beverage, including a nice restaurant at the top that had a njce overlook of the waterfall. Our five year old did the hike with no problem, but our two-year-old we had to carry, mostly because the stairs were pretty steep, and we are worried about him falling. This was a great addition to our itinerary of visiting temples, fun to do something a little different and to get a little hike in."

The water was a nice temperature should you want to get in I suggest you wear water shoes there are a lot of large pebbles in the water, I did not were water shoes in and found it a little awkward on the footing at times.DO NOT JUMP off the accessible ledge the water below is not deep AND YOU WILL CAUSE YOURSELF AN INJURY .Now after you cool down and are nice and relaxed sorry you have 150 plus stairs to climb up.A very pleasant outing"

The water was very nice on our visit. It wasn't cold and although it wasn't very clear, it wasn't dirty either. It was actually very refreshing and the wonder of the beauty of nature made it even more so. The strength and sound of the water coming over the falls is awe inspiring. We actually climbed up to the upper part of the falls as well. The climb back up to the parking lot after we were done wasn't easy but we saw it as a nice chance for some exercise and it really shouldn't be too taxing for most people. In all, we spent a very fast hour and a half at the falls and it was more than worth the 10,000 rupiah/person entry fee. Yes, I would most definitely go again!"

Tegenungan waterfall was a nice quick visit from our ubud villa.The 6 of us (ages 4,7,8,35,40,65) went for an hour and a half as seldom do we have a chance to visit a large waterfall with shallow enough (at the time of our visit) water to stand under.Swam over with a 7 and then 8 year old holding my shoulders and was one of the highlights of our whole trip.Worth a visit but quite busy and lots of construction going on at the top of the stairs for touristy things.The stairs are there and steep but the three kids didn't seem to have too much of a problem with them asides from the littlest who needed a carry for some of the higher steps."

Our taxi pulled up at what then was a basic shanty-style shop, we hopped out and stumbled down the rudimentary track. To get over to the falls we had to jump over stepping stones and cling to the side of the rocks, but once at the actual falls we were amazed by how beautiful they were and loved that the area was still quite untouched and were the only ones there. One year later I went back to the falls with my husband and was so shocked at how much had changed in just 12 months. There are several shops and so much construction at the top. So many people selling goods, and there is now a paid carpark cut into the earth. Hundreds of tourists were milling around and the walk down to the falls has been completely paved over so you just walk down concrete stairs to the base. At the actual falls there are people and rubbish everywhere, hawkers selling beer, that of course the tourists just throw where ever it lands. Overall it is dirty and not a nice place to be. It made me sad to see what was once so beautiful become just another exploited tourist trap."

The falls themselve were beautiful bigger thasn I expected but tha tmay have soemthing to do with recent rains. I expect it dries up at other times of the year. The pool below the falls offer a nice place to take a dip but on the way down there is a nice natural spring where locals bath. The water here is cool, refreshing and clean. A great place to cool down and refresh."

It is found deep down in a valley--probably a couple of hundred steep and at times, narrow steps. The day we went it was raining off and on and so the steps and path were quite slippery so caution was definitely needed. However, in spite of this the view was very nice. The waterfall, while not large when compared to Niagara Falls, for example, was non the less very beautiful. The spray felt amazing and the coolness of the water below the falls was so refreshing. Many peple were swimming around and a few een under the falls. The entrance cost was only 10,000rupiah. Many little shops and cafes at the top of the valley to explore local crafts. Two hours is more than enough time to allow for a visit here."

This waterfall requires a small admission fee (as do the bathrooms at the top, so keep some smaller bills!) and lots of stairs down the cliff, but at the bottom the waterfall is spectacular! It's impossible to really swim directly into it, but so much fun trying! We had a group and would pull each other in as far as we could. I went first with a Balinese friend and another friend who lives in Jakarta, and we had the place almost to ourselves. We'd had a hard day's work, and found refreshment and renewal just standing by the falls and feeling the spray. It's a great way to spend an hour or two."

To visit this place, we should pay entrance fee / park (relatively cheap). We can see the beautiful of Tegenungan waterfall from the top generally, but if we wanna see closer and more beautiful, we have to go down hundreds of stairs and pass several hurdles. After seeing Tegenungan waterfall closer, we need to go back, so we have to climb up hundreds of stairs, and climb up more difficult and more require energy than go down. All of this requires effort, but worth it!Tips : Best time to visit this place is dry (wet) season or on sunny day. Rainy day is not a recommended time to visit, it'll be slippery and more difficult.p.s. Check my Flickr to see photos of Bali and many more!

We were able to get some pictures and a swim. We left about 10.30 and it was already getting very busy! From what I've heard the waterfall is best to visit during the other half of the year due to the season. I'd recommend bringing a spare set of clothes if your swimming, bringing some towels and some lunch and enjoying it down there. You can walk up and look from halfway down the waterfall and you can walk down further along the stream. There are quiet a few steps and it would be very difficult for elderly to get up or down. The water is considered sacred and as its fresh water your skin becomes very smooth and soft the next day."

There are toilets on the way down there in cafes but they charge approx. 3k, if you did want somewhere to get changed. I remember seeing somewhere offer showers for a price too but I can't remember how much. We walked back up in our swimwear with towels wrapped around us and hopped onto our moped to dry off on the ride back.There are plenty of vendors/cafes selling food/clothes etc around there and it cost us 10k each to get in, if I remember correctly."

Cost an additional 5000 to park there. I would advise not buying things there as its quite the tourist trap and things will be 2-3 times more expensive. The waterfall is quite amazing going back up the steps will take some effort but we'll worth it. There are quite a few tourists there so if you want to get some nice photos you should probably get there in the early morning."

We visited the waterfall in the afternoon, to find quite a few people there. Its beautiful and we were lucky to see a rainbow right across the waterfall. Its fairly shallow so many get into the water to play. There are 170 steps down to reach, but climbing back up will sweat you out, as the steps are quite high. However once up there are toilets and a shower room for a small charge if required. There was some construction happening at a lower level near the fall which looked like toilets, so maybe by Nov'15, one wouldnt have to climb all the way back up to change after a swim. Overall its a lovely place to relax, sit on the rocks with feet in the water and enjoy the view. Worth a trip if staying or passing by Ubud."

My wife and I had only four days in Bali, so we were anxious to pack in as much sight-seeing as possible in a relatively short amount of time. There are quite a few famous and very beautiful waterfalls on Bali, and we had time to see only one. The Tegenungan Waterfall is utterly beautiful, even spectacular, and is located in a magnificent location. I recommend it highly as a natural sight worth visiting during a sojourn on Bali. There are only two drawbacks to Tegenungan. First, it is located in the far more populated, heavily touristed southern corner of the island. It is therefore visited by many more foreign tourists than some of the more remote (and more spectacular) waterfalls on the island. It was very crowded at and around the falls \u2013\u2013 which unfortunately detracted from my enjoyment of this undeniably beautiful sight.Second, the trek from the parking lot down to the falls themselves is pretty arduous. The many, many high, steep steps down can be tough on the knees, especially if you're over 50 or 60 years of age. And the trek back \u2013\u2013 well, let's just say it was twice as difficult for this 66-year old! I don't regret it, however."

We arrived there around 11 in the morning, paid 10.000 IDR each + 5.000 for our driver and his car (I read that people found it expensive, but doesn't bother me at all to pay less than 2\u20ac for this experience knowing that it helps a few locals). First you'll enjoy the view from the top terrace in front of the waterfall and quickly you'll just wanna run downstairs (around 5min) to see it closer. Everything is pretty raw there, the little bridges in bamboo just make the place a lil bit more authentic. You'll cross the river, trek 2 minutes and you'll finally be at the feet of the waterfall. Around 35 meters high (no it's not the Niagara Falls, if you were expecting that you're just in the wrong continent) but so powerful, you'll first be in awe and then in a hurry to take off your clothes to take a bath ... Water is not hot but not cold neither, you can easily go inside (would be a mistake not to) and enjoy the noisy water flow. As it is constantly moving it's obviously not crystal clear but it's not muddy at all (stones and sand at the bottom). Place is small, so as the afternoon begins it started to get crowded, I would recommend to go in the morning to fully enjoy the place (and take pictures without anyone in the frame) and take your time. As every place where Man has landed, there can be some trash around but there is a bin where you can put your cigarette butt or empty bottles to preserve Mother Nature (just sayin..), but it wasn't the rubbish dump some have describe where we were there and you definitely can't blame nature for that. The way up is a little bit rough as steps are high but totally doable if you're healthy (I did it, yet I'm a heavy smoker and far from being an athlete). There is toilet upstairs and downstairs if you really need to, it will cost you around 3.000 IDR. You'll also find someone to sell you cold drinks every 10 meters, and there are a few shops upstairs with snacks or young coconuts. If you're staying in Ubud or simply passing by, it really worth to take a couple hours to see it. "

My only regret is I did not bring any beachwear to join in the fun of so many adults acting like children in a play pool. Do not worry there is no changing area for you. They have some changing areas with an open concept and you can rinse yourselves there too. There are proper and seemingly well-furnished toilets far from the waterfall and next to a pit stop at where you will walk down to the waterfall. It costs you some money. I can't remember the amount because I did not use it. The adventurous ones can find your way to climb up to see the waterfall even closer. The route is not very accessible so be careful when walking up. And do wear shoes as the path up can be rocky and very slippery. Also, walking down to the waterfall is fine but climbing up needs some stamina. The steps can be quite high. Even my fit local driver has to pause to catch his breath. Stay there longer and enjoy the fun at the waterfall."

We had reached here early in the morning. There were not many people on the spot. It is in the middle of jungle and takes about 5-7 mins walk to get to it from the parking place. There are couple of shops selling refreshments and local fruits along the way. The water was not so clean on the day we visited the falls. Our driver was suggesting that the water is usually cleaner on other days. After spending 15-20 mins around the place we continued our journey. There are not many activities which can be done around this place. Best thing you can do is to get bit adventurous and climb the rocks to the top of fall. Some people were taking bath while their friends were busy taking photos. For us it was a means of showing our little daughters the natural beauty and give them a real life experience of waterfall. If you are in crunch of time it is better to give this place a miss."

My favorite site was Tegenungan Waterfall. I could have stayed here for half of the day, but unfortunately my travel companions had other ideas.Upon entering the area you get a nice view of the falls from a seating area at the top. We (four of us) had a Bingtang at this location. I then traveled to the bottom of the falls via a well maintain trail of wooden steps, paved sections and dirt. I am guessing five minutes down and ten to fifteen minutes up if you are in decent shape. If I was traveling with just my wife, we would have played in the water pools at the bottom of the falls and cross the river to the other side. It would have been a great way to spend a few hours. Bring your swimsuit, rubber booties or some type of foot protection would be helpful.There is a cafeteria, and restrooms (charge for use) near the bottom of the falls. There are stalls near the top of the trail where local vendors are attempting to sell their wares, but they are not as aggressive as those at many of the temples."

There are quite a few rocks to cross when you get to the bottom but it is achievable for many. But even if you stop at the bottom of the steps, the view is worth the climb. My only criticism is there is just too much litter when you get down there. This put us off going for a swim and it would be great if the authorities used some of the entrance money to clear the place. Sadly there was also a monkey chained by its neck to a fence for 'tourist photo's'. It can be a pretty upsetting sight for those of us who love our wildlife."

As you can see in the photos I have posted the local boys having troubles walking along the edge. The place is just surrounded by magnificent palm trees and there is a restaurant at the top if you just want to witness the falls from a far.We did not have anytime at all to spend here which was disappointing as we were so hot and all we wanted to do was jump in the cool water to relax after a long day of shopping in Ubud. Just before we were leaving I noticed someone on top of the waterfalls photographing it (not jumping) though I have seen some a photo of man jumping off it on here. More on Ubud and Bali on my blog www.he11okiki.comHow to get here is easy if you hire a driver for the day which cost $50AUD as we were staying in Nusa Dua. Just ask him to take you here and show him a photo or he might have some brochures himself. Thanks for reading my review :)"

There are two small shops at the beginning selling refreshments but surprisingly they were not in your face about buying anything which made the experience so much better.People were swimming at the bottom of the waterfall - Unfortunately I didn\u2019t bring my bathers but plan to go back on my next trip to Ubud."

There was a lot of water,band it was pristine (surprised to hear others found it dirty!). The waterfall is definitely more impressive than it looks in photos - the sheer mass of it is incredible when you stand at the base. Went for a swim, even directly underneath the waterfall, but it was totally safe and completely thrilling! Perhaps a little difficult for some to reach the falls as it takes a bit of wading through rapids and climbing over rocks but this experience was a highlight of my trip! Nice to find places in Bali that are still the water nature intended :)"

Please note there's an entry fee, it's really to get past a barrier on the road, tourist based. The water was brown. I don't mean murky or dirty, no it was brown, like literally not one drop of clear, green, blue water. Apparently something must have happened downstream but the water look like chocolate.

Very easy to find whilst riding the scooter, using the trip advisor map, it took us around 20mins to ride there from Cocos Supermarket. It costs $1 AUD to enter which is nothing, there is also a little \"warung\" selling snacks and drinks. I also crossed the river to get a closer look at the waterfall, which was a lot easier than the flight of steps ! Definitely worth trip out there if your staying in Ubud or surrounding areas."

We were quite disappointed that the waterfall is actually very small and the water is brownish. We walked down the long steep flight of stairs to the waterfall. We thought we could swim in the water, but it is too brownish to swim. The walk up the steep stairs is really exhausting. Perhaps the water will be much clearer on other months."

As it is rainy time there was plenty of water,.. but it was rather brown. I promised my son to go for a swim, but the water was too much for a 4 year old. The walk is rather much especially when it slippery. But even if you go for the view, have a fresh coconut on the viewer platform it is well worth the money. TIP - combine it with your shopping trips in Mas."

My expectations were met upon arrival and witnessing this beautiful sight of nature. The viewing point is phenomenal and offers food an refreshments to visitors. Getting down to the waterfall requires a hike down a steep flight of stairs. Once at the base, there is a natural showering area separated for genders in which the water is so fresh you can drink. I was able to swim near the base of the falls and hear the roar of the falling water. Being that it was the rainy season, there was a fast current which made the swim slightly dangerous."

Our tour guide said it was because they were cutting rock out to make houses, which makes it very dirty. Not nice to look at, and the children target you when you step out of the car, and will not stop harassing you until you are back in the car, even once you refuse. They will guilt trip you saying they need money for food to survive, which is hard to believe when the girl pulled out her mobile phone to answer it, and I saw the other boy texting someone on his own mobile."

            "review": "Take your swimsuit and go for a bath. I agree with other reviewers: the scenery from the top of the hill is not exactly overwhelming, so this is most likely not the perfect destination for a bus tour. But for the more adventurous: you can get really close to the waterfall and take a \"shower\" or a swim, which is really great fun. The path that goes down requires you to take some big steps. On the foothill there is a nice bathing place, with separated male and female baths where the water comes down the hill. But you can get much closer than that: you can actually approach the waterfall itself by taking a narrow path on the left side of the river. If you go closer, you will see that there are some ropes attached to the rock. Leave your shoes at the big stones, hold on tight to the ropes and make sure that you don't slip on the wet stones. You can get as close to the waterfall as you wish since the water on the left-hand-side is pretty shallow. I stopped maybe five meters beforehand because the water came down with quite a force. Perfect for a \"shower\" even from this distance. Alternatively, you can also take a bath as the farther side of the river has some not-so-shallow parts. I went in August, I realise though that the depth of the river might vary depending on the rainy/non-rainy season."

The driver pays someone to park, you walk to an area like a patio, where at least 5 kids are begging you to buy a fan. There's a store there to buy a few snacks and unnecessary trinkets and souvenirs. A few logs to sit on and you watch the waterfall from this far distance. What's so great about that? I thought you would actually be able to go into the water as the water is falling. Not even close. It was nice for background photos though."

There are one or two shops where you can grab a coffee or a snack.You can contemplate the waterfall from far or take the stairs down to get closer to it, but after the stairs, there is no clearly defined way to get closer, which means you'll have to improvise with your own path.
